[KRILLIN] So, the three
of 'em may be treating

00:01:24.903 --> 00:01:26.139
the whole thing like a game,

00:01:26.172 --> 00:01:29.312
but it's definitely a game
they want Goku to lose.

00:01:29.345 --> 00:01:31.984
Wow. Are they really
that strong, though?

00:01:32.017 --> 00:01:35.791
[KRILLIN] Put it this way:
multiply Trunks' warning by ten.

00:01:43.974 --> 00:01:45.979
Oh no! I'm a terrible mother!

00:01:46.012 --> 00:01:47.716
I was so caught
up in all the commotion,

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:50.087
I almost forgot the
most important thing!

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.692
What are you talking about, Mom?

00:01:54.663 --> 00:01:56.601
You have studying to do.

00:01:56.634 --> 00:01:58.904
Wha? You can't be serious...

00:01:58.938 --> 00:02:01.844
Current circumstances do not
excuse you from schoolwork.

00:02:01.877 --> 00:02:04.783
Wow, Chichi; you really are
something else, you know that?

00:02:04.816 --> 00:02:06.854
So... what's our next move?

00:02:06.888 --> 00:02:08.824
Hey don't look at me.

00:02:08.857 --> 00:02:10.929
I don't have the slightest clue.

00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:14.368
This... may sound
crazy but here's a thought...

00:02:15.437 --> 00:02:18.811
Well since I know where doctor
Gero s secret laboratory is...

00:02:18.845 --> 00:02:22.585
Why not travel back to before
the Androids were activated?

00:02:22.618 --> 00:02:23.921
I could try to
destroy them while

00:02:23.955 --> 00:02:26.025
they re still dormant.
All at once.

00:02:26.058 --> 00:02:28.531
Of course...!
That'd totally work, right?

00:02:28.564 --> 00:02:31.135
Yeah, but... Stop me
if I'm wrong here Trunks,

00:02:31.168 --> 00:02:33.508
but I thought your time machine
wasn t all that precise...?

00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:35.712
Besides, like you told Goku,

00:02:35.745 --> 00:02:37.281
traveling back
and forth through time

00:02:37.314 --> 00:02:38.550
takes so much energy you d have

00:02:38.584 --> 00:02:41.022
a tough time getting enough
for a round trip, right?

00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:43.025
[KRILLIN] So if you jump
into the past again,

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:45.665
there s no guarantee that you ll
make it back to your time.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:46.967
Good point.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.106
But... If you could
actually go back and destroy

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.710
the Androids in past
what would happen

00:02:51.743 --> 00:02:54.048
to the ones that
are already here?

00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:55.652
[GOHAN]
In our present, I mean...?

00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:57.622
Would they all just
disappear or something...?

00:02:57.655 --> 00:02:59.158
Or would it be more like they...

00:02:59.191 --> 00:03:01.062
Well, like they never existed--

00:03:01.095 --> 00:03:04.001
Wait... That's right...
It couldn't work!

00:03:04.034 --> 00:03:05.237
If I went back to when before

00:03:05.271 --> 00:03:07.041
the Androids were
created and stopped

00:03:07.074 --> 00:03:09.178
Doctor Gero from
ever making them it'd alter

00:03:09.211 --> 00:03:10.313
the course of that timeline,

00:03:10.347 --> 00:03:11.817
but it wouldn't
change a thing about

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.022
the timeline they've
already become a part of...

00:03:14.055 --> 00:03:15.190
They'd still be here.

00:03:15.224 --> 00:03:16.994
I'm... not followin' you.

00:03:17.028 --> 00:03:19.031
Well... uh... Let's see...

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:21.368
[TRUNKS]
Okay, take Goku for example:

00:03:21.402 --> 00:03:24.208
The medicine I brought from
the future healed Goku here,

00:03:24.242 --> 00:03:27.181
in your present.
That created a future for you

00:03:27.214 --> 00:03:29.151
where he stays healthy
longer than he would have

00:03:29.185 --> 00:03:32.491
if I'd never shown up to
give him the medicine.

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:34.228
But in the future
where I came from,

00:03:34.261 --> 00:03:36.065
Goku's been gone a long time.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.537
Nothing I've done here
has changed that fact.

00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:41.008
[TRUNKS] An alternate future
exists for you guys now,

00:03:41.041 --> 00:03:42.077
but that's it.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.014
Okay, wait. My head's spinning.

00:03:44.048 --> 00:03:46.787
[KRILLIN] So by that logic,
the future you came from

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.858
stays the same
no matter what you do?

00:03:48.891 --> 00:03:51.897
Even if Goku does somehow
defeat the Androids here,

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:54.068
they'll still be running
wild in your own time?

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:54.803
That s right.

00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:55.772
But, then why go through the

00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:57.742
trouble of coming
here in the first place?

00:03:57.776 --> 00:03:58.678
The world where you're from

00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:01.148
wouldn't reap
any of the benefit.

00:04:02.885 --> 00:04:04.589
My mom said...

00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:07.461
...that she was done...

00:04:07.494 --> 00:04:09.232
Done living in
a world without any hope

00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:10.968
because of the Androids

00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:12.606
[TRUNKS] Any future where
they didn't exist

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:13.741
was good enough for her,

00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:16.279
even if is she
couldn't live in it herself.

00:04:16.312 --> 00:04:19.251
Of course recon was
the primary objective:

00:04:19.285 --> 00:04:21.155
she thought we might
find some weakness

00:04:21.188 --> 00:04:24.128
to exploit by watching
Goku fight them.

00:04:24.162 --> 00:04:26.833
And if that wasn t enough,
I was supposed to

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:31.743
bring him back to our time for a
faceoff with the androids there.

00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:45.838
Heh. I apologize... Thing is,

00:04:45.872 --> 00:04:47.775
the past I've traveled
back to is so different

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:49.813
from what we expected
that it throws a wrench

00:04:49.846 --> 00:04:51.248
into all of those plans.

00:04:51.282 --> 00:04:52.585
Not only is the timing of

00:04:52.618 --> 00:04:54.757
Goku's heart condition
a little skewed,

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.125
there's now one more Android

00:04:56.158 --> 00:04:58.564
than I was prepared
to have to deal with.

00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:00.233
[TRUNKS]
And for some reason,

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:02.672
all three Androids
are a lot stronger.

00:05:10.187 --> 00:05:12.526
Yeah... but... what was
it that made everything

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:14.930
change so much in our time--

00:05:14.963 --> 00:05:18.369
I don t know...
I can t explain it...

00:05:18.402 --> 00:05:19.973
But... maybe...

00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:21.308
...maybe it was me and

00:05:21.342 --> 00:05:23.112
my coming here only
made things worse.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.545
gave the company
a buzz a few days ago.

00:09:15.578 --> 00:09:17.013
Apparently these
guy's stumbled across

00:09:17.046 --> 00:09:19.619
some weird abandoned vehicle
they were hoping to claim.

00:09:19.652 --> 00:09:22.057
Trouble was, they had no idea
how to start it up,

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.928
so they asked if we
could help them out...

00:09:23.961 --> 00:09:25.798
'kay...so... um--

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:27.400
[BULMA] Well, our people
asked them what the

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:28.369
vehicle's model number was

00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:30.407
and they said
they couldn't find one.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.545
Naturally, we asked them
if they were sure it was a

00:09:32.578 --> 00:09:34.414
Capsule Corporation
product they'd found,

00:09:34.447 --> 00:09:37.287
and they said yes.Our logo
was right there on the body.

00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:39.926
We were shocked so we asked them
to take a photo of it and

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.097
send it over to us
as soon as possible.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.066
[BULMA CONTINUES]
Long story short,

00:09:43.099 --> 00:09:45.103
I've got the photo
in front of me...

00:09:45.136 --> 00:09:48.209
And not only is this Trunks'
time machine I'm staring at...

00:09:48.242 --> 00:09:51.482
It's showing some
major signs of wear and tear.

00:09:51.516 --> 00:09:54.488
That's impossible... Here, look.

00:09:54.523 --> 00:09:57.562
[TRUNKS] Yeah, see I've got
my time machine on me.

00:09:57.595 --> 00:09:59.498
It's condensed
into capsule form.

00:09:59.533 --> 00:10:01.603
He says he's got his time
machine with him.

00:10:01.637 --> 00:10:05.778
That's odd... I mean...
It's just... uncanny...

00:10:05.811 --> 00:10:08.416
The one in the photo's pretty
moss-eaten and overgrown,

00:10:08.449 --> 00:10:09.720
like it's been
sitting there a while,

00:10:09.753 --> 00:10:12.224
but otherwise we're
talking dead ringer.

00:10:12.257 --> 00:10:13.627
[BULMA] Do you think it s
possible that my

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.600
future self-cranked out more
than one of these things?

00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:17.802
Sorry, no...

00:10:17.835 --> 00:10:20.575
...you were barely able find the
materials to make one.

00:10:20.608 --> 00:10:21.977
[BULMA] Well, that's
really bizarre then,

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.480
'cause that would
have to make this the

00:10:23.514 --> 00:10:25.518
exact same machine
you traveled here in;

00:10:25.551 --> 00:10:26.953
I'm absolutely positive.

00:10:26.986 --> 00:10:29.124
I've got an eye for
this stuff, believe me.

00:10:29.158 --> 00:10:30.694
Here, let me shoot
a copy of the photo

00:10:30.727 --> 00:10:33.199
to you fellas so you
can see for yourself.

00:10:36.607 --> 00:10:38.610
Here, take a look at this.

00:10:43.687 --> 00:10:45.423
She's absolutely right.

00:10:45.456 --> 00:10:47.126
This is the exact same machine

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.732
I came here in;
there's no question.

00:10:52.905 --> 00:10:55.142
But, what does it mean?

00:10:57.882 --> 00:10:59.619
[TRUNKS] Does she know
the exact location

00:10:59.652 --> 00:11:00.888
where this photo was taken?

00:11:00.921 --> 00:11:02.391
Alright, he's got a question.

00:11:02.424 --> 00:11:05.063
Know where it was taken?
Like precisely?

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:06.566
Well, not precisely,

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:08.302
but judging from the postmark

00:11:08.336 --> 00:11:11.041
it s outside of section
1050 West. You going?

00:11:11.074 --> 00:11:13.880
Yes, I have to
see it for myself.

00:11:13.914 --> 00:11:15.717
[BULMA] I'd like to come,
if you don't mind.

00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:17.555
It's not that far for me.

00:11:17.588 --> 00:11:21.095
Uh... If you'd like to, I guess.

00:11:21.128 --> 00:11:22.297
So let me ask it again,

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.468
are you sure there's
only one time machine?

00:11:24.503 --> 00:11:26.706
Yes... I'm positive.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.313
Um... So, uh... I'd like
to have a look, too...

00:11:30.346 --> 00:11:31.481
If that's okay with you.

00:11:31.516 --> 00:11:32.985
Excuse me?

00:11:33.019 --> 00:11:35.156
It'll be fine, Mom.
I mean, come on...

00:11:35.189 --> 00:11:37.127
It's not like we're going
anywhere dangerous...

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.429
We'll be safe.

00:11:38.463 --> 00:11:41.034
[BULMA'S MOM] And some water
for you, beautiful...

00:11:42.772 --> 00:11:45.578
Hey mom... I ve gotta jet...
Something's come up...

00:11:45.611 --> 00:11:46.980
You mind watching Trunks for me?

00:11:47.014 --> 00:11:48.550
[BULMA'S MOM]
Glad to sweetheart,

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:51.556
but where you
headed in such a tiz?

00:11:51.589 --> 00:11:54.795
Nowhere bad... I'm just gonna
rendezvous with my son.

00:12:18.777 --> 00:12:20.012
Trunks...?

00:12:20.046 --> 00:12:22.752
What about the rest of the
humans the future you re from?

00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:24.589
I mean, have those
two Androids really managed

00:12:24.622 --> 00:12:26.760
to turn the whole planet
into a war zone.

00:12:26.793 --> 00:12:28.864
Well... That's one way
of putting it.

00:12:28.897 --> 00:12:32.505
Except if it's a war, humans
are easily on the losing side...

00:12:32.538 --> 00:12:35.310
The population's dwindled
to near nothing.

00:12:35.343 --> 00:12:36.846
The few tens of thousands of us

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:39.685
still around live in secret
underground bunkers.

00:12:39.719 --> 00:12:41.455
Wow... That's bad...

00:12:41.488 --> 00:12:42.791
[GOHAN] Then I sure do
hope they have a

00:12:42.825 --> 00:12:45.496
weakness like you said
and that we can find it.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.970
Yeah... Me too.

00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:52.043
[TRUNKS] I ve been thinking
about that. It was clear that

00:12:52.076 --> 00:12:55.217
Dr. Gero didn t want
to activate these Androids.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.722
He must have known
how dangerous they were.

00:12:57.755 --> 00:12:59.692
But we left him with no choice

00:12:59.726 --> 00:13:01.663
and that s when
they turned on him.

00:13:01.697 --> 00:13:04.234
Gero may have been
evil but he was no idiot.

00:13:04.268 --> 00:13:05.737
If the Androids were
a threat he would

00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:07.975
have had some
sort of backup plan.

00:13:08.008 --> 00:13:09.344
He would have needed some way

00:13:09.378 --> 00:13:11.716
to turn them off if they
suddenly went out of control

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:13.654
like an emergency
shutdown device.

00:13:13.687 --> 00:13:14.722
[TRUNKS]
It's a long shot,

00:13:14.756 --> 00:13:17.160
but if we can find it we
can use it to stop them.

00:13:17.194 --> 00:13:20.734
Aw, come on... I don't
think it's a long shot!

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:22.671
I wish I could agree with you.

00:13:31.455 --> 00:13:33.560
We're right on top of the area
we're looking for,

00:13:33.594 --> 00:13:34.896
so keep your eyes peeled.

00:13:34.929 --> 00:13:36.566
You got it.

00:13:57.775 --> 00:14:02.718
[GOHAN] Got it...! Hey, I found
it! Over here!

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:12.905
Nicely done, Gohan. Good eye.

00:14:16.078 --> 00:14:20.086
Didn't take Bulma very long...
I'll flag her down.

00:14:32.978 --> 00:14:34.248
Does anything at all happen

00:14:34.281 --> 00:14:36.887
in that big head of yours,
Number Sixteen?

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.458
[ANDROID 18] How do you not
get totally bored?

00:14:39.491 --> 00:14:41.228
Come on. Leave him alone...

00:14:41.261 --> 00:14:42.430
[ANDROID 17]
He'd much rather think about

00:14:42.463 --> 00:14:44.803
crushing Goku than gab with you.

00:14:44.836 --> 00:14:47.775
Oh, and by the way, you wanted
some new clothes, right?

00:14:47.808 --> 00:14:49.444
There's a little town coming up.

00:14:49.477 --> 00:14:52.952
Finally... I can slip into
something halfway decent.

00:14:52.985 --> 00:14:54.789
Well, what are you waiting
for number seventeen?

00:14:54.822 --> 00:14:57.226
Put the metal to the pedal.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.949
[POLICEMAN A] Stay right where
you are! Don't get cute!

00:15:07.982 --> 00:15:11.689
We've got visual confirmation;
this is the van reported stolen.

00:15:11.722 --> 00:15:12.925
[POLICEMAN B]
That a fact?

00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:16.131
Well, then you kids got
some explaining to do.

00:15:16.164 --> 00:15:17.835
That s it... Hands where I can
see em...! Come out now!

00:15:17.869 --> 00:15:22.009
Hey you there in the back!
Out! You hear me?!

00:15:26.586 --> 00:15:29.592
[POLICEMAN A] No funny business.
Make this easy on yourself.

Uh-oh, I need help here;
the perp is resisting!

00:15:36.806 --> 00:15:39.277
That's resisting?

00:15:39.311 --> 00:15:43.352
Huh... Imagine that.
See, I always thought resisting

00:15:43.385 --> 00:15:46.458
Whoa...! Few feet back there,
honey! Don t make me--

00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:48.564
[ANDROID 18] ...would be more
something like this...

00:15:48.597 --> 00:15:50.600
What are you doi--

00:15:59.753 --> 00:16:00.921
Bye.

00:16:12.845 --> 00:16:14.882
[BULMA] Hey, Trunks!
Look who s here!

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:23.432
It's me...!
The Mother of the Year!

00:16:23.465 --> 00:16:25.036
Uh, hello...

00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:26.873
Is it weird seeing
me all young?

00:16:26.906 --> 00:16:29.712
You have to tell me: do I stay
this gorgeous in the future?

00:16:30.647 --> 00:16:32.116
Well... You don't really

00:16:32.149 --> 00:16:34.354
change all that much, I guess.

00:16:34.387 --> 00:16:35.790
Seriously...?

00:16:36.425 --> 00:16:37.928
So as the years wear on,

00:16:37.961 --> 00:16:42.070
my delicate looks are spared
from the cold ravages of time?

00:16:42.103 --> 00:16:43.673
It's almost criminal!

00:16:43.706 --> 00:16:45.710
[BULMA LAUGHS]

00:16:45.744 --> 00:16:48.048
[TRUNKS]
Mother... Take a look.

00:16:50.587 --> 00:16:51.589
[CLICKS]

00:16:52.925 --> 00:16:55.931
[EXPLOSION]

00:16:57.968 --> 00:16:59.638
This is the ship you built.

00:16:59.672 --> 00:17:02.143
I've had it with me in capsule
form since I landed.

00:17:02.177 --> 00:17:03.780
[BULMA]
That settles it, then.

00:17:03.813 --> 00:17:06.786
This broken down old
thing can't be yours.

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.391
No, mom... There's only
ever been one of these.

00:17:09.424 --> 00:17:11.962
Weird as it is, there's
just no other way.

00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:14.434
This is the same one
I came here in.

00:17:14.467 --> 00:17:16.305
I don't know how,
it's got to be.

00:17:16.338 --> 00:17:17.608
Are you sure?

00:17:17.642 --> 00:17:19.077
[TRUNKS]
Positive.

00:17:20.113 --> 00:17:23.052
[BULMA]
What s that say? "Hope?"

00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:25.089
Right... You painted
it on there on there

00:17:25.122 --> 00:17:26.993
yourself just before I left.

00:17:27.026 --> 00:17:30.934
And... It's on both machines.

00:17:30.968 --> 00:17:34.073
Hold on a sec...
I have to think about this...

00:17:34.107 --> 00:17:36.344
You can tell this one's
been here for a while...

00:17:36.378 --> 00:17:38.850
Several years
by the looks of it.

00:17:40.019 --> 00:17:43.927
Huh... The dome... was melted...

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:49.037
Looking at how the edges curl,
I'd say from the inside out.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.911
Wait... inside? Do you think
the pilot did that?

00:17:52.945 --> 00:17:55.984
Maybe... Let's open it up...
Watch out.

00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:13.418
What the...?

00:18:18.663 --> 00:18:21.001
Wow, that's kinda ... weird...

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:22.872
Looks like an alien coconut.

00:18:22.905 --> 00:18:25.945
Hey... Let me see... please.

00:18:25.978 --> 00:18:27.547
Here you go.

00:18:29.351 --> 00:18:30.754
Okay...

00:18:36.766 --> 00:18:37.902
My best guess...

00:18:37.935 --> 00:18:40.641
...is this the shell
of some kind of... egg.

00:18:40.674 --> 00:18:42.210
You think so?

00:18:42.243 --> 00:18:45.015
I've never seen an
egg like that before.

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:52.598
Wait... What if... Well...

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:53.933
Suppose whatever it was that

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:57.006
made that hole in the dome...
hatched from it?

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.949
Residual energy's
almost down to zero...

00:19:02.952 --> 00:19:04.855
...but it should scan...

00:19:07.226 --> 00:19:10.232
Who or whatever
flew this ship...

00:19:10.265 --> 00:19:11.769
...came all the way from year

00:19:11.803 --> 00:19:14.107
Seven Hundred
and Eighty-Eight...

00:19:14.141 --> 00:19:16.746
Three years after
my first trip here.

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:17.714
[BULMA GASPS]

00:19:17.748 --> 00:19:19.383
If the board's still
reading correctly,

00:19:19.417 --> 00:19:23.092
then... it landed...
four years ago.

00:19:23.125 --> 00:19:27.066
[TRUNKS] A full year before I
defeated Frieza and his father.

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:30.006
Wait, I get it... Of course...!

00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:32.778
That's it...! That's the reason!

00:19:32.812 --> 00:19:34.247
[TRUNKS]
This explains why the events

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.886
of your timeline have
changed so much!

00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:46.137
So, this is how you
spend your time, is it?

00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:49.144
Spying on the world
from the safety of your perch?

00:19:49.177 --> 00:19:50.412
[PICCOLO] If it s a view
of the action you

00:19:50.445 --> 00:19:52.116
want then stop
stalling and lets

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:53.720
get this merger over with.

00:19:53.753 --> 00:19:55.658
You get to see if all up-close.

00:19:55.691 --> 00:19:57.928
So, it seems the
feelings of doom that have

00:19:57.961 --> 00:19:59.765
haunted me these
last four years have little

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:02.269
to do with the
Androids at all.

00:20:02.303 --> 00:20:04.642
Something has come...
some form...

00:20:04.675 --> 00:20:07.881
some pestilence
from I know not where...

00:20:07.915 --> 00:20:09.451
The only thing I do know,

00:20:09.484 --> 00:20:11.422
is that something worse
than the Androids

00:20:11.455 --> 00:20:13.727
...something far superior
to any of them

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.632
in strength is lurking
in the world below.

00:20:16.665 --> 00:20:18.268
What are you babbling about now?

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:20.674
What do you mean something's
lurking down there?

00:20:20.707 --> 00:20:22.745
[KAMI] The time has come
for me to relinquish

00:20:22.778 --> 00:20:24.781
my duties as guardian of Earth

00:20:24.815 --> 00:20:26.519
and assume with
you the mantel of a

00:20:26.552 --> 00:20:29.291
full-fledged Namekian warrior.

00:20:30.226 --> 00:20:34.468
[KAMI] Take heed Piccolo.
The foe... that we must face...

00:20:34.502 --> 00:20:37.608
is beyond imagining.
The feeling of sheer dread

00:20:37.641 --> 00:20:40.179
that heralds its coming...
is so strong...

00:20:40.212 --> 00:20:43.619
...all past enemies
pale in comparison.
