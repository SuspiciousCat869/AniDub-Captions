00:00:01.503 --> 00:00:03.842
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:05.945
Sick of his cohort's
incompetence,

00:00:05.978 --> 00:00:08.584
Vegeta removed Nappa
from the battlefield...

00:00:08.617 --> 00:00:11.624
Then, as the fight between
Goku and Vegeta began...

00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:12.959
Goku quickly realized,

00:00:12.993 --> 00:00:16.232
his only hope of matching his
opponent's unbelievable power,

00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:19.038
was to push his
body to its limit.

00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:20.407
Will it pay off?

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:25.250
Body, don't fail me now!
Kaio-ken times three!

00:00:26.486 --> 00:00:36.472
â™ª Opening Song â™ª

[NARRATOR]
"An All-Out Kamehame-Ha!

00:01:55.497 --> 00:01:59.204

Transformation!"

[GOKU screams]

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:56.653
Kaio-ken...
Times... Three!

00:02:59.324 --> 00:03:00.728
[VEGETA gasps]

00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:01.930

[VEGETA yells]

00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:07.975
Whoa... Awesome...

00:03:10.281 --> 00:03:11.650
[VEGETA] Take that!

00:03:11.683 --> 00:03:12.652
[VEGETA yells]

00:03:22.772 --> 00:03:24.642
[VEGETA screams]

00:03:25.444 --> 00:03:27.849
[VEGETA]
Darn you...!

00:03:29.285 --> 00:03:30.821
[VEGETA]
Wretched little...

00:03:31.723 --> 00:03:33.927
[VEGETA yells]

00:03:38.971 --> 00:03:41.409
[GOKU grunts]

00:03:41.443 --> 00:03:46.854
[VEGETA groans and coughs]

00:03:46.887 --> 00:03:50.828
[GOKU panting]

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.934
[VEGETA]
How is this happening?

00:03:58.075 --> 00:03:59.679
[GOKU winces]

00:03:59.713 --> 00:04:03.988
Crazy... Goku might just stand
a chance of winnin' after all!

00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:06.492
[VEGETA yells]

00:04:09.164 --> 00:04:14.374

[GOKU groans]

00:04:55.758 --> 00:05:00.067
[VEGETA groans]

00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:02.739
[VEGETA] I refuse
to believe this!

00:05:02.773 --> 00:05:07.480
It's not possible for Kakarot's
power level to exceed my own!

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.195
Are you kidding me?

00:05:14.228 --> 00:05:15.430
Man, he's tough...

00:05:15.463 --> 00:05:18.971
So much for trying to
settle this quickly.

00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:22.044
[GOKU winces]

00:05:22.077 --> 00:05:24.650
Just ignore the pain...

00:05:24.683 --> 00:05:26.754
[VEGETA] I belong to the
upper echelon of the most elite

00:05:26.787 --> 00:05:29.425
warrior class the
universe has ever seen!

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:31.062
I will not be bested!

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:34.870
Certainly not by some
low-born amateur like you!

00:05:34.903 --> 00:05:40.113
I am the greatest
warrior who has ever lived!

00:05:40.147 --> 00:05:41.750
[GOKU] Using the
Three-times Kaio-ken

00:05:41.784 --> 00:05:43.820
really does a
number on my body...

00:05:43.854 --> 00:05:45.490
I don't think
I can keep this up.

00:05:45.524 --> 00:05:48.964
If this drags out for too
much longer, I'm done for.

00:05:53.974 --> 00:05:57.214
[VEGETA] Blood...
My noble blood spilled

00:05:57.247 --> 00:06:00.487
by the sheer luck
of such...such trash...

00:06:00.522 --> 00:06:03.761
No, no, I will not
allow this to stand!

00:06:03.794 --> 00:06:08.270
I cannot allow this to stand!

00:06:08.303 --> 00:06:10.608
Your insolence just
cost you this world!

00:06:10.642 --> 00:06:12.244
I'll blow it all to pieces

00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:15.718
and there's nothing
you can do to stop me!

00:06:15.751 --> 00:06:17.522
[VEGETA grutns]

00:06:17.555 --> 00:06:19.124
He's gonna what?!

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:25.504
[VEGETA] Try to
dodge this, if you can...

00:06:25.537 --> 00:06:27.374
You might manage
to save yourself,

00:06:27.407 --> 00:06:29.712
but your precious
Earth is doomed!

00:06:29.746 --> 00:06:31.950
He's got me...!
What can I do?

00:06:31.983 --> 00:06:35.089
[VEGETA yells]

00:06:35.925 --> 00:06:37.728
I've gotta risk it!

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:45.443
[GOKU grunts]

00:06:45.477 --> 00:06:48.650

Kaaaaaa...! Meeeeee...!

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:02.011
Haaaaaaa...!

00:07:02.044 --> 00:07:03.013
[VEGETA] It's hopeless.

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:05.718
There's no way you
can stop my Gallic Gun!

00:07:05.752 --> 00:07:08.890
Meeeee...!

00:07:10.594 --> 00:07:14.034
Prepare to join this
filthy orb in oblivion!

00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:15.404

00:07:15.437 --> 00:07:21.115

[YAJIROBE yells]

00:07:28.664 --> 00:07:32.505
Impossible...! His blast is
exactly like my Gallic Gun!

00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:49.972
Kaio-ken... Times four!

00:07:56.987 --> 00:08:00.594
Ahh...! No!

00:08:00.627 --> 00:08:05.771

[YAJIROBE grunts]

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:27.447
What the hell?
Oh man... He...

00:08:27.481 --> 00:08:29.151
He did it!

00:08:29.185 --> 00:08:31.255
He actually did it! Ha Ha!

00:08:31.288 --> 00:08:34.228
Goku, you
magnificent bastard...

00:08:34.261 --> 00:08:35.697
Huh...?

00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:38.202
Yajirobe, what in the world
are you doin' out here?

00:08:38.236 --> 00:08:40.641
Well, uh... Someone had
to keep an eye on you.

00:08:40.674 --> 00:08:42.177
Strong as you are,

00:08:42.211 --> 00:08:44.314
you almost got your butt handed
to you a couple of times, huh?

00:08:44.347 --> 00:08:45.150
[GOKU laughs]

00:08:45.183 --> 00:08:46.418
I guess.

00:08:46.452 --> 00:08:49.257
Yeah... But hey... way to launch
that alien dude into orbit.

00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:52.464
I knew you'd come through
in the end... Nice one!

00:08:52.497 --> 00:08:58.276
[GOKU screams]

00:08:58.309 --> 00:09:00.915
What happened?
I barely touched you.

00:09:00.948 --> 00:09:03.821
I may have pushed my
body a bit past its limit.

00:09:03.854 --> 00:09:06.893
Well I guess I'm not surprised.
You were on fire...

00:09:06.926 --> 00:09:09.364
Listen to me...
You gotta get out of here.

00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:10.868
It's not safe yet...

00:09:10.902 --> 00:09:12.639
What are you
talkin' about?

00:09:12.672 --> 00:09:14.441
Uh...! You mean...

00:09:14.475 --> 00:09:15.878
He's still out
there somewhere.

00:09:15.912 --> 00:09:17.481
No way that was
all it's gonna take

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:19.820
to finish a
guy like that off.

00:09:19.853 --> 00:09:22.592
Yeah, who cares...?
Let him come back if he wants.

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:24.896
I mean, you'll just blow
him away again, right?

00:09:24.929 --> 00:09:28.670
Well... Not necessarily...
My body's pretty worn out.

00:09:28.704 --> 00:09:31.442
That might have been
all I had in me...

00:09:31.475 --> 00:09:34.481
You don't say, huh...
Uh, well, uh...

00:09:34.515 --> 00:09:37.021
Oh, look at the time.
I've gotta go...

00:09:37.054 --> 00:09:41.162
Don't worry, though;
I'll be here in spirit!

00:09:41.195 --> 00:09:44.168
[VEGETA screams]

00:09:44.201 --> 00:09:47.106
[VEGETA grunts]

00:09:52.451 --> 00:09:56.860
No!

00:09:56.893 --> 00:10:00.200
No low class bottom-feeder
can surpass me in strength!

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:01.503
It's unthinkable!

00:10:01.536 --> 00:10:03.640
I am not just a Saiyan;

00:10:03.673 --> 00:10:06.211
I am the culmination
of everything superior

00:10:06.245 --> 00:10:08.315
in the Saiyan race!

00:10:13.927 --> 00:10:15.631
As much as I hate
that's it come to this,

00:10:15.664 --> 00:10:17.301
it seems I'm left
with no choice...

00:10:17.334 --> 00:10:20.273
I'll transform to a Great Ape
and grind him to a pulp!

00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:21.510
[VEGETA laughs]

00:10:21.543 --> 00:10:23.213
We'll see how cocky
he is once he witnesses

00:10:23.246 --> 00:10:25.082
the full extent of my power.

00:10:25.116 --> 00:10:26.820
Fortunately,
I planned our arrival

00:10:26.853 --> 00:10:28.523
to coincide
with the full moon,

00:10:28.556 --> 00:10:29.692
but that was so
we could wipe out

00:10:29.726 --> 00:10:31.897
the inhabitants of
this planet quickly.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.934
I never imagined
I'd have to transform

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.704
to defeat a
single opponent...

00:10:35.738 --> 00:10:38.008
Curse that Kakarot!

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.021
Wait a minute...
Where is the full moon?

00:10:44.054 --> 00:10:45.791
I should be
able to see it now.

00:10:45.824 --> 00:10:46.827
[KING KAI laughs]

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:47.962
[KING KAI]
Search all you want;

00:10:47.995 --> 00:10:49.565
there won't be a
full moon out tonight.

00:10:49.599 --> 00:10:51.569
Or ever again,
for that matter.

00:10:51.603 --> 00:10:53.808
Piccolo suspected you'd
try something like this

00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:55.811
and took steps to prevent
that from happening

00:10:55.845 --> 00:10:57.648
long before you got there.

00:10:57.681 --> 00:10:59.686
Still, even in his normal form,

00:10:59.719 --> 00:11:02.024
that Saiyan is more
than a match for Goku...

00:11:02.057 --> 00:11:04.160
But he has been weakened
by the battle...

00:11:04.194 --> 00:11:07.869
If Goku can muster up the
strength for one all out attack;

00:11:07.902 --> 00:11:09.772
he might still have a chance...

00:11:09.806 --> 00:11:12.343
Wait! Of course!
The Spirit Bomb!

00:11:12.377 --> 00:11:16.853
Hit him with the Spirit Bomb,
Goku, and you can't lose!

00:11:20.861 --> 00:11:24.034
[GOKU] I don't like this.
What's he doing up there?

00:11:24.067 --> 00:11:26.338
Why won't he
come down and fight?

00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:28.810
[VEGETA] This can't
be happening! It's gone!

00:11:28.844 --> 00:11:30.213
The stupid thing is gone!

00:11:30.247 --> 00:11:33.486
How could an entire moon
just up and disappear?!

00:11:33.521 --> 00:11:37.026
Bastard! The conniving little
weakling knew what I had in mind

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.131
and took care to stack
the odds in his favor

00:11:39.164 --> 00:11:41.669
before the
fighting even began!

00:11:41.703 --> 00:11:43.072
So be it!

00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:45.243
What I'll have to do might
reduce my power level a bit,

00:11:45.276 --> 00:11:47.581
but at this point,
it's the only way.

00:11:47.615 --> 00:11:49.451
Ha! And I think
the look on his face

00:11:49.484 --> 00:11:50.821
should more than
make up for it...

00:11:50.854 --> 00:11:54.862
[VEGETA laughs]

00:12:10.594 --> 00:12:12.798
It's about time
he came back down...

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.346
[GOKU] The only way to take him
now is with a Spirit Bomb...

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.620
I'm just wondering if I can
stay focused long enough...?

00:12:23.653 --> 00:12:25.390
[VEGETA] Kakarot!

00:12:25.423 --> 00:12:26.593
Rather clever of you...

00:12:26.626 --> 00:12:28.028
blasting the moon
right out of the sky;

00:12:28.062 --> 00:12:29.966
but I'm afraid it
was all for nothing!

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:32.404
What? Why would
I do that?!

00:12:32.437 --> 00:12:33.472
[VEGETA laughs]

00:12:33.507 --> 00:12:35.143
Fine. Go ahead
and play dumb...

00:12:35.176 --> 00:12:37.247
But I'm curious...
Do you even know why it is,

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.219
we Saiyans transform
when we see a full moon?

00:12:40.253 --> 00:12:41.322
Wait... We do what?

00:12:41.355 --> 00:12:43.058
[VEGETA] The moon
appears lit only because

00:12:43.092 --> 00:12:45.263
it reflects the
light of the sun...

00:12:45.296 --> 00:12:47.735
But when the sunlight is
bounced from the lunar surface,

00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:49.872
it causes a slight
shift in the wavelength,

00:12:49.906 --> 00:12:52.377
creating what we Saiyans
know as a Blutz wave.

00:12:52.411 --> 00:12:53.513
And when the moon is full,

00:12:53.546 --> 00:12:56.017
their intensity is over
seventeen million zenoes.

00:12:56.051 --> 00:12:58.155
Uh, I'm afraid
you lost me there...

00:12:58.189 --> 00:13:00.159
[VEGETA] Once seventeen
million zenoes are absorbed

00:13:00.193 --> 00:13:02.430
by the Saiyan retina,
our bodies respond to

00:13:02.464 --> 00:13:05.804
a biochemical reaction
produced in the tail...

00:13:05.838 --> 00:13:07.542
...and we transform.

00:13:07.575 --> 00:13:09.010
Among the elite of our race,

00:13:09.044 --> 00:13:11.550
there are those capable of
actually producing a satellite

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:14.487
with the emission of zenoes
necessary to effect the change.

00:13:14.522 --> 00:13:17.695
And as luck would have it,
I am just such an elite.

00:13:17.728 --> 00:13:19.699
Observe when my
power ball mixes with

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:22.638
the oxygen in this atmosphere!

00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:27.047
[VEGETA yells]

00:13:27.882 --> 00:13:30.153
[VEGETA] Sorry to have given
you false hope, Kakarot.

00:13:30.186 --> 00:13:32.357
This nonsense should've
been over by now.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.096
Let this be a lesson to all
low class punks like yourself

00:13:35.129 --> 00:13:38.837
who dare challenge their
superiors on the battlefield!

00:13:38.871 --> 00:13:40.608
[GOKU] When that power
ball thing of his appeared,

00:13:40.641 --> 00:13:42.010
his energy dropped...

00:13:42.043 --> 00:13:43.914
Why would he risk
a move like that?

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.951
What is he planning to do?

00:13:48.523 --> 00:13:49.592
Heh, Ha!

00:13:50.326 --> 00:13:52.799
[VEGETA yells]

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.467
He wha...?!

00:14:04.054 --> 00:14:05.724
Burst open and mix!

00:14:05.757 --> 00:14:06.626
[VEGETA grunts]

00:14:19.384 --> 00:14:23.960
Wha... What is that?
What have you done?!

00:14:27.802 --> 00:14:30.239
[KING KAI]
No, he didn't...

00:14:30.272 --> 00:14:34.247
He... He did...!
He created a moon!

00:14:37.554 --> 00:14:38.957
[VEGETA laughs]

00:14:38.991 --> 00:14:41.195
[VEGETA] Boy, would that
long lost tail of yours

00:14:41.228 --> 00:14:43.967
ever come in handy
right about now!

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.448
[VEGETA laughs]

00:14:51.481 --> 00:14:55.389
[VEGETA grunts]

[GOKU gasps]

00:15:02.872 --> 00:15:07.682
Oh Goku, it's all over now.

00:15:07.715 --> 00:15:09.484
[GOKU gasps]

00:15:09.518 --> 00:15:13.492
[VEGETA APE roars]

00:15:15.229 --> 00:15:16.164
Huh...?

00:15:17.768 --> 00:15:19.438
What the heck was that?

00:15:19.471 --> 00:15:24.481
[VEGETA APE roars]

00:15:47.861 --> 00:15:50.032
Hey... See that?

00:15:50.065 --> 00:15:51.368
[GOHAN gasps]

00:15:53.205 --> 00:15:56.813
Wait... It's hovering over where
we just came from, isn't it?

00:15:56.846 --> 00:15:59.585
What the...?
It's so bright.

00:16:01.689 --> 00:16:04.629
[VEGETA APE roars]

00:16:04.662 --> 00:16:06.465
No... This isn't real!

00:16:06.498 --> 00:16:11.474
[VEGETA APE roars]

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:27.006
[KRILLIN] Whoa...
Do you feel that power?

00:16:27.039 --> 00:16:28.175
But that
could be good...

00:16:28.209 --> 00:16:30.848
I mean it could be
Dad's power, right?

00:16:30.881 --> 00:16:32.183
No... Sorry...

00:16:32.216 --> 00:16:34.789
There's no mistakin' where
that energy's coming from.

00:16:34.822 --> 00:16:36.091
It's crazy.

00:16:36.124 --> 00:16:38.329
That guy's strength
is totally off the charts.

00:16:38.362 --> 00:16:40.934
What's goin' on down there?

00:16:40.967 --> 00:16:43.740
My... dad is...

00:16:50.286 --> 00:16:51.622
Hey!

00:16:54.394 --> 00:16:56.733
[GOHAN] I...
I have to go back.

00:16:56.767 --> 00:16:57.935
Uhh...

00:16:57.968 --> 00:17:00.608
He needs me.

00:17:00.641 --> 00:17:02.043
But... He told us to...

00:17:02.077 --> 00:17:03.479
He told us to
get outta there!

00:17:03.513 --> 00:17:05.282
[GOHAN]
Look, I can't explain it,

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:07.555
but I just know that
Dad's in danger...

00:17:07.588 --> 00:17:10.861
If I don't help him, something
terrible's gonna happen!

00:17:10.894 --> 00:17:12.363
Oh, c'mon, man. Heh...

00:17:12.397 --> 00:17:14.267
This is Goku we're
talkin' about here.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.606
I mean the guy eats danger
for breakfast, right?

00:17:16.639 --> 00:17:18.543
Besides, how could a
couple of runts like us

00:17:18.576 --> 00:17:21.348
help out someone as
powerful as your dad?

00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:24.922
Yeah... You're
probably right, but...

00:17:24.956 --> 00:17:27.961
So what?!
I have to go back!

00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:30.165
That's all there is to it!

00:17:30.834 --> 00:17:32.839
[KRILLIN]
Hey, wait...!

00:17:32.872 --> 00:17:35.409
Hold up! Wait for me!

00:17:37.981 --> 00:17:43.191

00:17:49.539 --> 00:17:51.342
[VEGETA APE laughs]

00:17:51.375 --> 00:17:54.114
So, then...
What do you think?

00:17:54.147 --> 00:17:56.017
Rather impressive, isn't it?

00:17:56.051 --> 00:18:00.727
[VEGETA APE laughs]

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.165
What the heck's going on here?

So... He's like... like
some kinda ape monster?

00:18:24.742 --> 00:18:27.514
[VEGETA APE] How 'bout I let
you in on a little secret?

00:18:27.548 --> 00:18:29.786
When I adopt the
form of a Great Ape,

00:18:29.819 --> 00:18:31.990
my strength
increases tenfold!

00:18:32.023 --> 00:18:34.227
[VEGETA APE roars]

00:18:38.468 --> 00:18:40.005
[GRANDPA GOHAN] Now,
Goku, you know very well

00:18:40.039 --> 00:18:43.312
the giant gorilla monster lurks
about during the full moon...

00:18:43.346 --> 00:18:45.149
You have to stay
indoors tonight.

00:18:45.183 --> 00:18:47.922
Sound asleep if you can...

00:18:47.955 --> 00:18:49.490
[KAMI] Well...
Not to worry, my boy.

00:18:49.525 --> 00:18:51.763
We can fix it so this
little nuisance of yours

00:18:51.796 --> 00:18:53.132
never grows back.

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:55.704
I'll warn you,
it might sting a bit...

00:18:56.806 --> 00:19:00.479
[GOKU] So that's why...
It all makes sense now.

00:19:01.583 --> 00:19:03.553
[GOKU] But if...
if it's true...

00:19:03.587 --> 00:19:05.590
If I really am
like this guy...

00:19:05.624 --> 00:19:08.095
Then... The monster that stomped
my Grandpa Gohan to death

00:19:08.129 --> 00:19:11.602
and smashed up the tournament
grounds all those years ago...

00:19:11.635 --> 00:19:14.641
That... That was me,
wasn't it?!

00:19:21.187 --> 00:19:23.024
[GOKU] I owe
it to you, Grandpa.

00:19:23.058 --> 00:19:25.597
I owe it to you and everybody
else to take this guy down

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:30.105
no matter how strong he is;
even if it kills me...

00:19:30.139 --> 00:19:31.609
And if I see you
in the next world,

00:19:31.642 --> 00:19:33.212
I'll make it
a point of saying

00:19:33.245 --> 00:19:35.984
I'm sorry for all the horrible
things I must've done...

Alright Vegeta...
Let's finish this!

00:19:41.563 --> 00:19:44.367
I can't beat you when
you're in that form...

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.306
But maybe...
a Spirit Bomb can!

moves like a rabbit.

Not even a Kaio-ken
times five would work.

00:21:09.337 --> 00:21:10.507
And with speed like that,

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.211
I don't have time
to make a Spirit Bomb!

00:21:13.245 --> 00:21:14.213
Ha!

00:21:14.247 --> 00:21:16.184

your move, huh?

Well then,
guess I'll come to you!

[NARRATOR] The
situation is desperate.

Now that Vegeta has taken
the form of a Great Ape,

is the Spirit Bomb.

Can he buy himself
the time he needs?

00:21:28.743 --> 00:21:31.414
[GOKU] Come on... I only
need ten lousy seconds!

00:21:31.448 --> 00:21:34.521

to concentrate!

Hey it's me, Goku!

00:22:39.519 --> 00:22:41.455
Oh, man... I've gathered
enough energy from Earth

00:22:41.488 --> 00:22:42.657
to make a Spirit Bomb,

00:22:42.691 --> 00:22:44.828
but Vegeta's attack
was just too fast!

00:22:44.861 --> 00:22:46.197
I don't know if
I'll be able to...

00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:47.067
[VEGETA]
You should know by now

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.302
that it won't work...

00:22:48.335 --> 00:22:50.339
not before I crush you
with my bare hands!

my dad down right now!
