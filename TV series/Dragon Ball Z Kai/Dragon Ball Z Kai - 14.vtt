Sick of his cohort's

his only hope of matching his
opponent's unbelievable power,

00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:19.038
was to push his
body to its limit.

it's the only way.

we Saiyans transform
when we see a full moon?

00:12:40.253 --> 00:12:41.322
Wait... We do what?

00:12:41.355 --> 00:12:43.058
[VEGETA] The moon
appears lit only because

00:12:43.092 --> 00:12:45.263
it reflects the
light of the sun...

00:12:45.296 --> 00:12:47.735
But when the sunlight is
bounced from the lunar surface,

00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:49.872
it causes a slight
shift in the wavelength,

00:12:49.906 --> 00:12:52.377
creating what we Saiyans
know as a Blutz wave.

00:12:52.411 --> 00:12:53.513
And when the moon is full,

00:12:53.546 --> 00:12:56.017
their intensity is over
seventeen million zenoes.

00:12:56.051 --> 00:12:58.155
Uh, I'm afraid
you lost me there...

00:12:58.189 --> 00:13:00.159
[VEGETA] Once seventeen
million zenoes are absorbed

00:13:00.193 --> 00:13:02.430
by the Saiyan retina,
our bodies respond to

00:13:02.464 --> 00:13:05.804
a biochemical reaction
produced in the tail...

00:13:05.838 --> 00:13:07.542
...and we transform.

00:13:07.575 --> 00:13:09.010
Among the elite of our race,

00:13:09.044 --> 00:13:11.550
there are those capable of
actually producing a satellite

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:14.487
with the emission of zenoes
necessary to effect the change.

00:13:14.522 --> 00:13:17.695
And as luck would have it,
I am just such an elite.

00:13:17.728 --> 00:13:19.699
Observe when my
power ball mixes with

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:22.638
the oxygen in this atmosphere!

00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:27.047
[VEGETA yells]

00:13:27.882 --> 00:13:30.153
[VEGETA] Sorry to have given
you false hope, Kakarot.

00:13:30.186 --> 00:13:32.357
This nonsense should've
been over by now.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.096
Let this be a lesson to all
low class punks like yourself

00:13:35.129 --> 00:13:38.837
who dare challenge their
superiors on the battlefield!

00:13:38.871 --> 00:13:40.608
[GOKU] When that power
ball thing of his appeared,

00:13:40.641 --> 00:13:42.010
his energy dropped...

00:13:42.043 --> 00:13:43.914
Why would he risk
a move like that?

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.951
What is he planning to do?

00:13:48.523 --> 00:13:49.592
Heh, Ha!

[KING KAI]
No, he didn't...

00:14:30.272 --> 00:14:34.247

we just came from, isn't it?

00:15:56.846 --> 00:15:59.585
What the...?
It's so bright.

00:16:01.689 --> 00:16:04.629

[KRILLIN] Whoa...
Do you feel that power?

00:16:27.039 --> 00:16:28.175
But that
could be good...

00:16:28.209 --> 00:16:30.848
I mean it could be
Dad's power, right?

00:16:30.881 --> 00:16:32.183
No... Sorry...

There's no mistakin' where
that energy's coming from.

It's crazy.

00:16:36.124 --> 00:16:38.329
That guy's strength
is totally off the charts.

00:16:38.362 --> 00:16:40.934

I have to go back.

Uhh...

00:16:57.968 --> 00:17:00.608
He needs me.

00:17:00.641 --> 00:17:02.043
But... He told us to...

00:17:02.077 --> 00:17:03.479
He told us to
get outta there!

00:17:03.513 --> 00:17:05.282
[GOHAN]
Look, I can't explain it,

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:07.555
but I just know that
Dad's in danger...

00:17:07.588 --> 00:17:10.861
If I don't help him, something
terrible's gonna happen!

Oh, c'mon, man. Heh...

I mean the guy eats danger
for breakfast, right?

00:17:16.639 --> 00:17:18.543
Besides, how could a

00:17:18.576 --> 00:17:21.348
help out someone as
powerful as your dad?

Yeah... You're
probably right, but...

I'll warn you,

like this guy...
