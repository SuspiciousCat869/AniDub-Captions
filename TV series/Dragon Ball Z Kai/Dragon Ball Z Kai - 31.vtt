00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:04.910
Welcome to Planet Namek.

00:00:04.943 --> 00:00:06.747
You are now
clear to disembark.

Opening outer hatch.

00:00:24.683 --> 00:00:27.722
[Goku] Right, now I have
to find everybody, quick.

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:32.230
Gohan... Krillin... Bulma...

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:40.748
There's someone over there...

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.490
And another there...

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:46.493
Wow. When they said

00:00:46.527 --> 00:00:48.698
there were some
insanely strong guys here,

00:00:48.731 --> 00:00:50.166
they weren't kidding.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.275
Gohan! And Krillin!
They're hurt...

00:00:54.308 --> 00:00:56.279
They're both just barely
hanging on...

00:00:56.312 --> 00:00:58.751
They're in the same
place, near those three

00:00:58.784 --> 00:01:01.422
other huge
powers I'm sensing.

00:01:01.456 --> 00:01:03.994
It's okay, guys...
I'll be right there.

00:01:04.028 --> 00:01:06.232
It's finally time for me
to put all that training

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:09.104
at 100-times
gravity to the test!

So you finally
decided to show up.

Gohan...

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.927
Here, son. I brought
you a senzu bean. Eat it.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.866
Gohan! Hey! Gohan!

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.204
No good...
His neck's broken.

00:03:22.238 --> 00:03:23.707
He prob'ly can't hear me.

00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:24.943
But it's alright...

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:27.181
I'll feed it to you and get
you fixed right up, okay?

00:03:27.214 --> 00:03:29.820
Hey, you! Who are you?!

00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:31.791
What'd you think you're
doin, chargin in here?!

00:03:31.824 --> 00:03:33.426
You know these losers?!

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.700
Here we go Gohan
just try to swallow...

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:38.571
Huh! Feel better?

00:03:38.605 --> 00:03:42.545
It's you... Dad!
Y-You're really here!

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.819
What the-- That kid was
almost dead a second ago!

00:03:45.852 --> 00:03:47.522
Yeah, how'd he do that?

00:03:47.556 --> 00:03:49.258
[Goku] There. Good as new.

00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:52.164
[Gohan] Dad, you have to
be careful with these guys.

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:53.601
[Goku] Don't worry,
we'll get to that.

00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:55.070
But first we need
to get one of these

00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:56.874
senzu beans
to Krillin, right?

00:03:56.907 --> 00:03:58.744
Yeah... Right...

00:03:58.778 --> 00:04:00.681
[Goku] So you've had it
pretty rough here, huh?

00:04:00.714 --> 00:04:04.956
[Gohan] Mm-hm... I didn't
think we were gonna make it.

00:04:06.392 --> 00:04:07.662
What happened to Vegeta?

00:04:07.695 --> 00:04:09.465
He's looking
pretty beat up, too.

00:04:09.498 --> 00:04:12.572
That big guy... Vegeta tried
to fight him before we did...

00:04:12.605 --> 00:04:16.412
but he was just too
strong for any of us.

00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:22.023
[laughing] Goku...

00:04:22.057 --> 00:04:25.297
Krillin... Sorry it
took me so long.

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.967
Here... Senzu bean?

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:28.637
[laughing]

00:04:28.671 --> 00:04:31.978
Yeah, thanks buddy...
but I'm not sure it'll help.

00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:34.314
What? Of course it will.

00:04:36.553 --> 00:04:38.657
Now he's back
on his feet, too...

00:04:38.691 --> 00:04:41.563
What is going on
around here? For real.

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:43.901
Look, man...

00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:45.905
I know you can already
sense it yourself...

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:47.542
how strong these guys are?

00:04:47.575 --> 00:04:49.212
Sure the senzu
bean fixed me up,

00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:50.581
but we're just gonna
get clobbered again!

00:04:50.615 --> 00:04:53.587
I'm sorry, but we don't have
a chance-- not even you!

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.491
Their power is just
at a whole other level.

00:04:55.525 --> 00:04:56.760
You shoulda' seen it.

00:04:56.794 --> 00:04:58.163
Even Vegeta was getting
knocked around like he--

00:04:58.196 --> 00:05:00.834
Right... Him too... I heard.

00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:03.541
But I don't get it, why was
Vegeta fighting these guys?

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:05.578
Aren't they all
on the same side?

00:05:05.612 --> 00:05:08.584
Well, they were, but things
sorta got complicated...

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.325
[Goku] You don't need to
explain... I'll feel it out.

00:05:12.358 --> 00:05:14.929
[Krillin] Y-You'll what?

00:05:34.937 --> 00:05:37.340
Oh... So that's it.

00:05:37.374 --> 00:05:40.314
I saw the whole story...
I saw the Grand Elder

00:05:40.347 --> 00:05:42.519
and how he gave you
two that big power boost.

00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:44.088
And I saw that
Bulma's still safe...

00:05:44.122 --> 00:05:46.794
And the part about Frieza, and
the Dragon Balls being taken,

00:05:46.827 --> 00:05:48.965
and even these
Ginyu guys-- I got it all.

00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:51.335
What?! That's crazy! I mean,

00:05:51.368 --> 00:05:52.805
since when do you know
how to read minds?!

00:05:52.838 --> 00:05:55.845
Well... I dunno. I wasn't
really sure it would work...

00:05:55.878 --> 00:05:57.582
I just had a feeling.

00:05:57.615 --> 00:06:00.153
I also saw that Vegeta's
still as nasty as ever...

00:06:00.187 --> 00:06:02.558
but when it came down to it,
he still saved you guys,

00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:04.095
so I guess we owe him one.

00:06:04.128 --> 00:06:08.035
Wow... Goku... You are
seriously freakin' me out here.

00:06:09.773 --> 00:06:13.847
This is the last
senzu bean, huh?

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.003
Hey Vegeta!

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:30.615
That's for you! Eat it!

00:06:30.648 --> 00:06:33.486
Wait! No! You said
that's the last one, right?!

00:06:33.521 --> 00:06:35.891
Don't... waste it!

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:43.908
What's happening...?!

00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:45.143
What're you thinking?!

00:06:45.176 --> 00:06:47.616
Even if you heal Vegeta
and we all fight as a team...

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:49.620
it won't do any good!

00:06:49.653 --> 00:06:51.624
I have my reasons, Krillin...

00:06:51.657 --> 00:06:53.995
I wanna make sure
Vegeta stays in good shape

00:06:54.028 --> 00:06:55.665
for our rematch back on Earth.

00:06:55.698 --> 00:06:59.138
Your rematch back on Earth?
Are you serious?

00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:00.574
--Yeah.
--Hey... wait...

00:07:00.607 --> 00:07:03.547
Stay here... I'll take
care of these Ginyu guys.

00:07:03.581 --> 00:07:06.485
What?! All of them,
all by yourself?!

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.957
He means it...

00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:25.758
[Recoome chuckling]

00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:30.033
You really think you got
what it takes to beat us, huh?

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:31.737
Yeah, you're real funny.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.710
Oh, man... This has
to be the worst idea ever...

00:07:34.743 --> 00:07:37.481
Does Goku really not
sense how strong they are?

00:07:37.515 --> 00:07:39.151
These Ginyus are
way out of our league!

00:07:39.185 --> 00:07:43.627
I-I dunno, Krillin...
something's different...

00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:47.869
Now, how 'bout I
crack you up, Funny Man.

00:07:47.903 --> 00:07:50.541
Hey! Tell me the new
guy's power level

00:07:50.574 --> 00:07:52.745
so I don't kill
him with one shot!

00:07:54.983 --> 00:07:57.487
You might not be
able to help yourself!

00:07:57.522 --> 00:07:59.659
[Burter] He's only
about five-thousand!

00:07:59.692 --> 00:08:02.932
What?! Aw, man...
Is that really all you got?!

00:08:02.965 --> 00:08:05.203
I shoulda' figured
you were all talk.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.715
I don't understand why is
Kakarot so unusually calm?

00:08:10.748 --> 00:08:13.053
Surely he realizes
what he's up against...

00:08:13.086 --> 00:08:16.092
But still... He's
completely at ease...

00:08:16.125 --> 00:08:18.730
He hasn't even bothered
to put up his guard.

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:25.476
Wait! Has he--
Has he actually done it...?

00:08:25.511 --> 00:08:27.949
Oh, wait...
I get it... You're nuts!

00:08:27.982 --> 00:08:31.189
Right? You got some kind of sick
death wish or somethin'?

00:08:31.222 --> 00:08:32.558
[smirk]

00:08:32.592 --> 00:08:35.263
Huh? Yeah, that settles it.
You're crazy. Here I am

00:08:35.297 --> 00:08:38.269
about to kill you and you're
smiling like an idiot.

00:08:38.303 --> 00:08:40.842
Listen, you can't beat me.

00:08:40.875 --> 00:08:44.081
I can tell without
even fighting you.

00:08:45.518 --> 00:08:46.820
[laughing]

00:08:46.853 --> 00:08:49.091
You got a million
of 'em, don'tcha?!

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:50.093
You boys hear that?!

00:08:50.126 --> 00:08:51.997
Funny Man's still
tellin' jokes over here!

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:55.336
I'm about to keel over
I'm laughin' so hard.

00:08:55.604 --> 00:08:58.476
Whoa... maybe... he
really has gone crazy...

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.314
I know he never
used to talk smack

00:09:00.347 --> 00:09:01.583
to his opponents like that.

00:09:01.617 --> 00:09:03.721
Yeah, it's...
not like him... I don't get it.

00:09:03.754 --> 00:09:06.159
I've never seen him
act like this before.

00:09:06.192 --> 00:09:10.299
I-It... couldn't be... No...

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:12.839
That...
That would be impossible...

00:09:12.872 --> 00:09:15.344
Kakarot, that low-class scum?

00:09:16.045 --> 00:09:19.853
There's no way someone like him
could become a Super Saiyan!

00:09:19.886 --> 00:09:21.388
Thanks for all the laughs, guy,

00:09:21.422 --> 00:09:24.295
but I think I've heard about as
much from you as I wanna hear.

00:09:24.328 --> 00:09:28.202
I say it's time we wipe that
smile off your face for good.

00:09:29.673 --> 00:09:31.943
No... According to
all the old legends...

00:09:31.977 --> 00:09:35.183
it's been over a thousand
years... since one appeared...

00:09:35.216 --> 00:09:36.519
A Super Saiyan--

00:09:36.553 --> 00:09:38.790
a warrior who was able to break
free of his normal limitations

00:09:38.824 --> 00:09:41.362
to achieve an
unprecedented level of power!

00:09:41.395 --> 00:09:42.932
But those were
just old stories,

00:09:42.966 --> 00:09:44.467
I never actually
believed them...

00:09:44.502 --> 00:09:47.407
And... even if they are true,
only an elite warrior like

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.280
myself would have the potential
to ascend to those heights--

00:09:50.313 --> 00:09:52.217
not some fool like Kakarot!

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.291
[Recoome] Okay, you ready?!
Lights out, Funny Man.

00:09:58.062 --> 00:09:59.932
[howling]

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:05.176
Now feel the power!
Of... Recoome!

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.681
Die!

00:10:13.661 --> 00:10:15.965
He's gone!

00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:18.970
Um... But where?

00:10:21.242 --> 00:10:24.181
That's strange... Did
you see what happened?

00:10:26.051 --> 00:10:27.789
What's that?!

00:10:27.822 --> 00:10:29.091
How'd you get there?!

00:10:29.124 --> 00:10:30.828
Yeah! You punk!

00:10:30.861 --> 00:10:32.965
He's over there! Whoa...

00:10:32.998 --> 00:10:34.636
[Krillin thinking]
So that's it...

00:10:34.669 --> 00:10:36.907
That's what had
Vegeta so freaked out...

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.979
He's the only one who
actually saw Goku move...

00:10:40.012 --> 00:10:42.083
You guys are all working
for this Frieza character

00:10:42.116 --> 00:10:44.355
I've heard so
much about, right?

00:10:44.388 --> 00:10:47.394
I'll give you one last chance to
leave this planet peacefully...

00:10:47.427 --> 00:10:50.066
If I were you, I would take it.

00:10:55.511 --> 00:10:58.884
What?! How'd we miss?!

00:11:04.963 --> 00:11:06.900
[Recoome]
Alright, you little bastard...

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:09.906
You got yourself some
speed, I'll give you that.

00:11:10.574 --> 00:11:12.444
But... It doesn't
change nothin'.

00:11:12.477 --> 00:11:15.016
You can't win if
all ya' do is run!

00:11:16.285 --> 00:11:19.926
Still, if that's how you wanna
play it, fine... I'm game.

00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:21.462
I got a move I save special

00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:23.601
just for dealin' with
freaks like you.

00:11:23.634 --> 00:11:25.236
Go ahead! Try and run!

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.008
When I'm done, this whole
place is gonna be a pile of ash!

00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:30.313
And I'm gonna be
standin' on top!

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:32.852
[Vegeta thinking]
This is it.

00:11:32.885 --> 00:11:34.956
Kakarot's moment of truth...

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.394
I'm gonna blast all of
four of you off the map

00:11:37.428 --> 00:11:39.265
with this one shot!

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:42.070
[electric charging sounds]

00:11:42.103 --> 00:11:44.374
Bye-Bye! Heh!

00:11:47.113 --> 00:11:51.355
Gah! Recoome...!

00:11:51.388 --> 00:11:54.629
Ultra Fighting...!

00:11:54.662 --> 00:11:58.504
Miracle Attack...!

00:11:58.537 --> 00:11:59.539
[boom]

00:11:59.573 --> 00:12:03.312
[gasping]

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.324
There. Done? Sorry,
but you did kinda' leave

00:12:09.358 --> 00:12:13.132
yourself wide open there,
y'know? Bad move.

00:12:15.637 --> 00:12:17.975
Not... funny...

00:12:31.469 --> 00:12:33.607
[Gohan]
Did... Dad just win...?

00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:36.011
You're kidding!
How could he?!

00:12:36.044 --> 00:12:37.949
Even if Goku did
catch him off guard...

00:12:37.982 --> 00:12:40.086
This is still the same guy
that you, me, Vegeta--

00:12:40.119 --> 00:12:42.692
we couldn't put so much
as a scratch on him!

00:12:42.725 --> 00:12:44.494
And Goku floored
him with one punch...?

00:12:44.528 --> 00:12:48.804
Am I seeing things here?
Is... Is Recoome down...?

00:12:48.837 --> 00:12:51.876
No... After one shot?
That was barely a tap!

00:12:57.722 --> 00:13:00.126
Damn... Kakarot...!

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:01.930
The others may not
have seen what happened,

00:13:01.963 --> 00:13:03.767
but you can't fool my eyes!

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.572
That was no ordinary attack.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.983
The amount of
force he channeled

00:13:12.017 --> 00:13:15.056
into that single point--
it was devastating...

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.060
There's no question that
Kakarot has surpassed

00:13:17.094 --> 00:13:19.532
the normal limitations
of a Saiyan warrior...

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:21.135
but... but how?

00:13:21.168 --> 00:13:22.972
Some sort of special training?

00:13:23.006 --> 00:13:25.811
Could the legend
really be true?

00:13:25.844 --> 00:13:29.184
Has Kakarot become...
become...

00:13:29.217 --> 00:13:31.355
a Super Saiyan?!

00:13:32.691 --> 00:13:34.360
[Goku]
What's it going to be, you two?

00:13:34.394 --> 00:13:37.233
Leave here and go back to
wherever it is you came from?

00:13:37.267 --> 00:13:38.302
Or stay...

00:13:38.336 --> 00:13:40.306
...and wind up like
your friend here?

00:13:43.847 --> 00:13:45.450
You believe this guy?

00:13:45.483 --> 00:13:47.387
I think Recoome had
him pegged from the start.

00:13:47.421 --> 00:13:50.193
He's obviously got
a few screws loose.

00:13:50.226 --> 00:13:53.432
Yeah... Delusions of
grandeur, from the sounds of it.

00:13:53.466 --> 00:13:54.301
He knocks Recoome out,

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:55.805
and suddenly he's
king of the world!

00:13:55.838 --> 00:13:58.108
One lucky shot.
That's all it was.

00:13:58.142 --> 00:14:01.082
And he only got it because
Recoome was an idiot.

00:14:01.115 --> 00:14:04.455
Right... It was just a fluke,
it won't happen again...

00:14:04.488 --> 00:14:05.724
He's a joke!

00:14:05.758 --> 00:14:08.463
His power level barely even
made a blip on the scouters.

00:14:08.496 --> 00:14:10.801
Wh-What's he doing now?

00:14:10.835 --> 00:14:12.739
He's... gonna fight
'em both at once?

00:14:12.772 --> 00:14:14.340
[Gohan] I think so...

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:19.318
Ready?

00:14:19.351 --> 00:14:21.121
Yeah...

00:14:29.003 --> 00:14:33.045
It's the Ginyu Force Red Magma!

00:14:37.253 --> 00:14:38.255
Jeice!

00:14:38.288 --> 00:14:45.804
And! Here comes the
Blue Hurricane! Burter!

00:14:45.837 --> 00:14:49.444
So I guess you're not leaving...

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.289
Let's go!

00:14:55.323 --> 00:14:56.491
Now!

00:15:01.536 --> 00:15:04.308
Now you listen to us, little
man. We'll tell you--

00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:05.945
[kapow]

00:15:05.978 --> 00:15:16.232
[screaming]

00:15:16.566 --> 00:15:19.137
Why-Why you...!

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.674
Hmmm? Now, what were you saying?

00:15:20.707 --> 00:15:23.847
Sorry, but you guys really do
leave yourselves wide open.

00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:25.550
That's it!

00:15:25.584 --> 00:15:27.420
We're done talking!

00:15:32.732 --> 00:15:33.366
Wa--

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:34.869
You're dead!

00:15:34.902 --> 00:15:36.606
[Goku yelling]

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:39.377
[screaming]

00:15:42.417 --> 00:15:47.995
What was that?! Where'd he
get that power all of a sudden?

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.400
Unreal... It's...

00:15:50.433 --> 00:15:53.272
like he just flexed his
muscles and sent 'em flyin'...!

00:15:57.882 --> 00:15:59.017
Maybe we were wrong...

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.554
Maybe these two Ginyu guys

00:16:00.588 --> 00:16:03.259
aren't really as strong as
we were afraid they were...

00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:05.496
They can't even lay
a finger on my Dad.

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:09.204
Uh-uh... I don't think
that's it. You feel it?

00:16:09.237 --> 00:16:11.242
They're both puttin'
out a ton of power...

00:16:11.275 --> 00:16:12.679
They're at least as
strong as that Recoome,

00:16:12.712 --> 00:16:14.616
and he was a monster!

00:16:14.649 --> 00:16:15.984
It's hard to believe...

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.921
But maybe Goku's
just so strong now

00:16:17.955 --> 00:16:19.892
he's making 'em
look like pushovers.

00:16:19.926 --> 00:16:21.462
Yeah... I thought that...

00:16:21.495 --> 00:16:25.369
But if that's true, shouldn't we
be sensing Dad's energy too?

00:16:28.242 --> 00:16:30.213
This... this doesn't
make any sense!

00:16:30.246 --> 00:16:31.616
The scouter doesn't lie!

00:16:31.649 --> 00:16:34.120
His power level is
only 5,000! No mistake!

00:16:34.153 --> 00:16:35.590
Those fools...

00:16:35.624 --> 00:16:38.362
It's obvious that Kakarot is
suppressing his power level,

00:16:38.396 --> 00:16:41.903
then raising it sharply in
the exact instant he attacks...

00:16:41.937 --> 00:16:43.874
He's holding every
last ounce of energy

00:16:43.907 --> 00:16:45.611
in reserve until he needs it.

00:16:45.644 --> 00:16:48.182
And when he strikes,
it's such a brief flash

00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:51.255
that not even those advanced
scouters are able to detect it.

00:16:51.288 --> 00:16:54.094
But, how much
power is he concealing?

00:16:54.127 --> 00:16:58.168
just how strong has
Kakarot actually become?!

00:16:58.202 --> 00:16:59.906
'Kay...that does it!

00:16:59.939 --> 00:17:04.481
This puny little maggot is not
gonna make a fool outta me!

00:17:04.515 --> 00:17:05.684
Hey, Jeice!

00:17:05.717 --> 00:17:08.823
I say it's time we break out
the Purple Comet Crush!

00:17:08.857 --> 00:17:13.900
Been a while since we dusted
that one off. Sounds good.

00:17:13.934 --> 00:17:15.671
Let's end this clown!

00:17:15.704 --> 00:17:16.772
[Burter] Oh yeah!

00:17:16.806 --> 00:17:26.860
[yelling]

00:17:27.562 --> 00:17:30.432
[Jeice and Burter]
Purple Comet Crush!

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.419
That's it!

00:17:42.023 --> 00:17:43.627
What are those idiots doing?!

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.064
Don't they know it's impolite
to keep a lady waiting?!

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:47.267
This is ridiculous!

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.837
And that goes for Goku, too.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.208
I don't care if he is flying
halfway across the galaxy,

00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:53.112
there's no excuse
for being late!

00:17:53.146 --> 00:17:55.450
I am ready to get
off this rock, now!

00:17:55.483 --> 00:17:57.286
The sun here is murder
on my complexion!

00:17:57.319 --> 00:17:59.057
And if I get so
much as a blemish,

00:17:59.091 --> 00:18:01.128
then somebody's gonna pay!

00:18:01.161 --> 00:18:01.862
[explosion]

00:18:01.896 --> 00:18:03.800
[yelling]

00:18:09.746 --> 00:18:13.219
Come! On! Somebody
please just take me home!

00:18:13.252 --> 00:18:15.456
Did we get 'im or what?!

00:18:18.295 --> 00:18:21.669
You have gotta be kidding me...

00:18:21.702 --> 00:18:22.436
[Burter] Jeice...

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.341
[Jeice] What is it, Burter?

00:18:24.374 --> 00:18:26.011
Let's go for Plan B...

00:18:26.044 --> 00:18:28.349
You'll fire your
Crusher Ball... Right?

00:18:28.382 --> 00:18:31.188
Our speedy little friend
here is gonna try to dodge it,

00:18:31.221 --> 00:18:32.758
and when he does--

00:18:32.791 --> 00:18:33.860
[Jeice] Yeah? Then what?

00:18:33.893 --> 00:18:35.196
[Burter] What do you think?

00:18:35.229 --> 00:18:36.866
I'll swing around and
slam him from the back...

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.072
I don't care how fast he is,
I'm the fastest in the universe!

00:18:40.106 --> 00:18:43.880
By the time he sees me comin',
he'll already be a grass stain.

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:45.617
Right. Let's do it.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:51.028
So now we've been reduced to
petty sneak attacks. All right!

00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:54.001
Crusher...!

00:18:54.034 --> 00:18:57.440
Ball!

00:18:57.975 --> 00:18:59.745
Now, make your move...

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.751
Damn it! Hurry and dodge!

00:19:03.687 --> 00:19:05.824
He deflected it?! What?!

00:19:05.857 --> 00:19:07.159
Wait!

00:19:08.062 --> 00:19:09.832
Curse you!

00:19:14.642 --> 00:19:17.848
C'mon... Where
the heck did he go?

00:19:17.882 --> 00:19:19.852
Burter, behind you!

00:19:23.125 --> 00:19:24.060
Hey.

00:19:24.093 --> 00:19:26.297
What? Nobody outflanks me...!

00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:31.108
I'm Burter! I'm the fastest
in the whole universe!

00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:34.180
Well, maybe the
second fastest now.

00:19:35.282 --> 00:19:36.819
[Jeice thinking]
What is going on?!

00:19:36.853 --> 00:19:39.257
No one brushes off my
Crusher Ball like that!

00:19:39.291 --> 00:19:42.497
And nobody puts
the moves on Burter!

00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:45.737
It's like something
straight out of a nightmare!

00:19:49.043 --> 00:19:50.379
What are you?!

00:19:50.413 --> 00:19:53.519
I'm a Saiyan who was
raised on Earth... That help?

00:19:54.922 --> 00:19:56.391
You lie!

00:19:56.424 --> 00:19:59.131
How could some stupid Saiyan
monkey ever be faster than me?!

00:19:59.164 --> 00:20:00.366
Don't know.

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:02.971
Maybe... Maybe I just train
harder than you?

00:20:03.004 --> 00:20:06.044
Whatever. It doesn't
matter! No--

00:20:06.077 --> 00:20:08.984
You won't be able
to run forever!

00:20:09.017 --> 00:20:10.452
I'll wear you down...

00:20:10.486 --> 00:20:13.125
And as soon as your speed
starts to fail... you're mine!

00:20:13.159 --> 00:20:14.628
Ha!

00:20:16.733 --> 00:20:18.102
Damn it!

00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:19.705
I've had enough of this maggot!

00:20:19.738 --> 00:20:24.681
Noone makes fools out
of the Ginyu Force!

00:20:26.585 --> 00:20:29.190
[Burter] Ha! It's all you
can do just to dodge me!

00:20:29.224 --> 00:20:30.627
You can't even fight back!

00:20:30.661 --> 00:20:32.931
[Goku]
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:20:39.177 --> 00:20:40.145
Idiot!

00:20:40.179 --> 00:20:43.285
'tha hell you're
kicking me for?!

00:20:48.328 --> 00:20:49.765
Relax, Burter...

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:52.938
This is no time for us to be
fighting between ourselves...

00:20:52.971 --> 00:20:54.474
Yeah... Right...

00:20:54.509 --> 00:20:57.748
[Goku] Excuse me...
But this is your last chance...

00:20:57.781 --> 00:21:01.054
Quit... Now...
Or I will fight back.

Three Ginyus are down,

00:21:29.678 --> 00:21:30.780
only two remain!

00:21:30.814 --> 00:21:34.353
The battle continues,
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

[Goku] Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:39.652 --> 00:22:41.822
Wow, this guy
looks like a tough one...

00:22:41.855 --> 00:22:43.325
[Ginyu] Thanks to
you, all of our

00:22:43.358 --> 00:22:45.730
special Ginyu Force
fighting poses are ruined!

00:22:45.763 --> 00:22:47.868
I slaved over
that choreography!

00:22:47.901 --> 00:22:51.074
You'll pay for this, or my
name isn't Captain Ginyu!

00:22:51.107 --> 00:22:53.546
[Goku] Okay, but I
warn you, I won't hold back!

00:22:53.579 --> 00:22:56.017
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:22:59.057 --> 00:23:03.431
[Ginyu] Don't miss my
fabulous Ultra Fighting Pose!
