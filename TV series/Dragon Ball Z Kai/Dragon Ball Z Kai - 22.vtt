[NARRATOR] Last
Dragon Ball Z Kai...

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:06.647
The Namekians fought to
stop Frieza's henchmen

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.116
from ransacking their village.

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.488
But Frieza remained
unimpressed.

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:12.592
Realizing a direct
battle could not be won,

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:15.163
the Village Elder attempted
to thwart Frieza's efforts

00:00:15.197 --> 00:00:19.338
by destroying his Scouters--
to disastrous results.

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:23.313
[DODORIA] Every last one
of 'em's gonna die!!!

00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:26.085
[NARRATOR]
Dodoria attacks...! Now!

Terrifying Chase!

00:01:55.765 --> 00:01:58.570

Rrrr... Yaaarrrgh!

00:02:06.654 --> 00:02:07.556
[NAMEKIAN C] Elder!

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:10.226
[FRIEZA] Dodoria, Stop!
Wait a moment!

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.296
[FRIEZA]
The old one can wait...

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.567
See to the other three first.

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.343
[DODORIA]
Yaaaarrrggh!

00:02:22.451 --> 00:02:25.290
[DODORIA]
Heh heh heh heh...

00:02:25.324 --> 00:02:27.094
[DODORIA] I almost wish
there were more of you

00:02:27.128 --> 00:02:29.065
so I'd have a chance
to break a sweat.

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:30.433
[NAMEKIAN C] Ridiculous...!

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:32.973
There's no way you could
take on three of us at once!

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:34.208
[DODORIA] You
obviously have no idea

00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:35.945
what you're talking about...

00:02:35.978 --> 00:02:38.283
I'd start running
if I were you.

00:02:38.316 --> 00:02:39.719
[NAMEKIAN C] No!

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:10.782
[DODORIA]
Heh heh heh heh...

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.084
[NAMEKIAN D] No!

00:03:12.117 --> 00:03:14.121
[KRILLIN] No use... That's not
even gonna slow him down...!

00:03:14.154 --> 00:03:15.958
They're screwed.

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:32.257
[FRIEZA] Well, well...

00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.062
I admire your enthusiasm,

00:03:34.095 --> 00:03:35.532
but you must realize by now

00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:39.037
that even the strongest
among you is no match for us.

00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:40.207
[FRIEZA] In any
case, come back

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.678
down here so we can proceed.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.352
[FRIEZA] There...

00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:49.726
It's not so hard to
be obedient, now is it?

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:51.931
[FRIEZA] And while I'm sure
you've learned your lesson...

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:53.200
I'd like an apology...

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.103
Why don't you bring
me your Dragon Ball

00:03:55.137 --> 00:03:57.542
and we'll forget
the whole thing?

00:04:02.484 --> 00:04:05.023
[ELDER] Very well...
You leave me no choice...

00:04:05.057 --> 00:04:06.092
But you have to promise me

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:08.296
that you won't
harm the children!

00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:14.408
[FRIEZA] I'm glad you're
finally listening to reason.

00:04:15.477 --> 00:04:17.314
[GOHAN]
Th-Those monsters...!

00:04:17.347 --> 00:04:18.884
[KRILLIN] Hey,
settle down, okay...?

00:04:18.917 --> 00:04:21.389
Don't you start getting
all heroic on me...

00:04:21.423 --> 00:04:23.794
Those guys are way
too powerful for us

00:04:23.827 --> 00:04:25.631
and you know it!

00:04:30.842 --> 00:04:31.710
[ELDER]
There...

00:04:31.744 --> 00:04:32.879
You have our
village's Dragon Ball,

00:04:32.913 --> 00:04:34.448
so please be on your way!

00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:36.051
[FRIEZA]
Bring it to me.

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.592
[FRIEZA] Now if you
just tell us exactly where

00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:41.897
to find the other two
Dragon Balls on this planet,

00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:44.135
we'll be on our way.

00:04:44.168 --> 00:04:45.671
[ELDER] Don't be absurd...!

00:04:45.705 --> 00:04:47.207
If you think
I'm going to tell you

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.778
where there are
more Namekians for you

00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:51.984
to torture then you
are sadly mistaken!

00:04:52.017 --> 00:04:53.721
Now... Keep
your promise...

00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:56.058
You have our Dragon
Ball, so leave us alone!

00:04:56.091 --> 00:04:58.564
[FRIEZA] Just like the
others... Uncooperative...

00:04:58.598 --> 00:05:00.467
Always trying to protect
your fellow Namekians,

00:05:00.502 --> 00:05:03.807
with no regard at all
for what I might want.

00:05:03.841 --> 00:05:06.680
[FRIEZA] And for being
an ungracious host...

00:05:06.713 --> 00:05:08.517
you'll will die
with the children.

00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:10.453
[ELDER] But you
gave your word!

00:05:14.495 --> 00:05:15.531
[EDLER]
You promised me

00:05:15.564 --> 00:05:16.666
you'd leave the
children alone...!

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.236
You already have
the Dragon Ball,

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:19.739
what good will it
do to hurt them?

00:05:19.773 --> 00:05:20.875
[FRIEZA]
None...

00:05:20.908 --> 00:05:22.211
But unless I have all
seven of the Dragon Balls,

00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:24.682
I may as well not
have any of them.

00:05:25.483 --> 00:05:27.622
[FRIEZA] And since you
decided to destroy our Scouters,

00:05:27.655 --> 00:05:30.460
we have no way of locating
the Balls ourselves.

00:05:30.493 --> 00:05:32.765
Therefore, it's up to
you to help us find them.

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:34.101
[ELDER]
I already told you...

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:37.141
I'll die before I'll help
you terrorize my people.

00:05:37.174 --> 00:05:38.409
[FRIEZA] That's
certainly an option...

00:05:38.443 --> 00:05:40.848
but then who would look
after the children...?

00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:43.419
Well, if you'd rather die
than help, I can oblige.

00:05:43.453 --> 00:05:44.889
[ELDER]
What?

00:05:44.923 --> 00:05:47.828
[FRIEZA] Dodoria... Please
dispose of our little friend.

00:05:48.797 --> 00:05:50.601
[KRILLIN] Wait...
those dirty!

00:05:50.634 --> 00:05:52.038
[ELDER] It isn't
safe for you here...!

00:05:52.071 --> 00:05:53.440
Hurry, children! Run!

00:05:53.473 --> 00:05:55.443
[DENDE]
Yes, Elder!

00:05:56.478 --> 00:05:57.548
[ELDER] I don't
think you realize

00:05:57.582 --> 00:06:00.086
what Namekians
are capable of!

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.596
[crash]

00:06:09.071 --> 00:06:10.741
[DENDE]
Cargot!

00:06:12.612 --> 00:06:15.416
[KRILLIN]
No... Gohan!

00:06:16.787 --> 00:06:18.456
[KRILLIN] There's
nothing we can do...!

00:06:18.489 --> 00:06:19.526
We wouldn't
stand a chance

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:21.295
if they found
out we were here!

00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:23.266
[DENDE] Cargot
don't be dead...

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.504
please don't be dead.

00:06:43.608 --> 00:06:48.985
[DODORIA]
Hahahahaha!!

00:06:49.018 --> 00:06:49.853
[snap]

00:06:49.886 --> 00:06:50.889
[gasp]

00:06:50.922 --> 00:06:52.658
[thud]

00:06:54.563 --> 00:06:56.265
[DODORIA] Is that all
you're 'capable of'...?

00:06:56.299 --> 00:06:59.204
I'm disappointed...
That was weak.

00:07:01.142 --> 00:07:02.878
Hahahaha!!

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:14.502
[DODORIA] Judging
by your size...

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:16.973
You shouldn't be
too much trouble.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.082
[DODORIA] Let's just
get it over with.

00:07:21.116 --> 00:07:24.222
[GOHAN]
Yaaaaahh!!

00:07:24.255 --> 00:07:25.891
Stop it!

00:07:27.596 --> 00:07:28.698
[DODORIA]
What the...?

00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:31.703
Who was that...?
Come out!

00:07:34.174 --> 00:07:35.744
[crash]

00:07:38.885 --> 00:07:41.656
[GOHAN] That's what
you get...! Jerk!

00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:48.103
[DODORIA] Hey...! Who
the heck are you... kid?

00:07:48.136 --> 00:07:49.873
[KRILLIN]
Darn it, Gohan!

00:07:49.906 --> 00:07:51.676
[GOHAN] Leave him
alone...! Now...!

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.246
Pick on someone
your own size!

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:54.949
[DODORIA]
Is that right?

00:07:56.887 --> 00:07:58.691
[GOHAN]
Krillin, there you are!

00:07:58.824 --> 00:08:00.695
[KRILLIN] Are you trying
to get us both killed...?!

00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:02.397
'cause that's sure
what it looks like...!

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.067
Get out of here!

00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:05.236
[KRILLIN]
Now, Gohan!

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.806
[GOHAN]
Right!

00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:12.685
[FRIEZA] Why are you
still sitting there...?!

00:08:12.719 --> 00:08:14.823
Bring them to
me, immediately!

00:08:14.856 --> 00:08:16.325
[KRILLIN] Let's get
as far away as we can.

00:08:16.359 --> 00:08:17.995
It's all over if
they catch up to us!

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:19.732
[GOHAN]
Got it!

00:08:22.906 --> 00:08:24.475
[DODORIA] Idiots...
Run all you want,

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:26.946
but you'll never
get away from me!

00:08:31.322 --> 00:08:32.658
[KRILLIN]
No good...!

00:08:32.692 --> 00:08:35.564
He's already on top of us...!
He's just too fast!

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.277
[KRILLIN]
Gohan!

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:53.567
[KRILLIN]
No...! Damn it!

00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:56.038
[DENDE]
Ahh!!

00:08:58.878 --> 00:09:00.647
[KRILLIN]
Not gonna make it!

00:09:03.754 --> 00:09:05.692
[KRILLIN] Gohan, thanks
for the help, but move...!

00:09:05.725 --> 00:09:07.796
He's right behind me!

00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:08.930
Hurry!

00:09:12.772 --> 00:09:14.141
[DODORIA]
Well now...!

00:09:14.174 --> 00:09:16.111
You're a lot more slippery
than I gave ya credit for!

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:19.820
[GOHAN] He's
getting closer...!

00:09:19.853 --> 00:09:21.255
We're gonna have to
stop and fight him!

00:09:21.288 --> 00:09:22.625
[KRILLIN]
You crazy...!

00:09:22.659 --> 00:09:24.428
We're only alive because
he hasn't caught us yet...!

00:09:24.461 --> 00:09:27.100
Keep flying or all
three of us are goners!

00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:30.541
[KRILLIN] Hey...!
I have an idea!

00:09:30.574 --> 00:09:31.944
[KRILLIN]
Okay...

00:09:31.977 --> 00:09:32.845
We'll never be able to beat
this guy in a fair fight...

00:09:32.878 --> 00:09:34.048
But we're not beat yet...

00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:35.651
I'm gonna try something,
but whatever you do,

00:09:35.685 --> 00:09:36.786
don't look at me!

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:37.888
[GOHAN]
'Kay, Krillin!

00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:42.097
[KRILLIN] Try
this on for size!

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.834
[KRILLIN]
Taio Ken!

00:09:49.311 --> 00:09:52.417
[DODORIA] My eyes!
I can't see!

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.587
[KRILLIN] Hey,
I did it...!

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.156
I can't believe
that actually worked!

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.563
Come on, Gohan...!
Hide while you can!

00:09:58.597 --> 00:09:59.966
[GOHAN]
Right!

00:10:19.137 --> 00:10:21.676
[DODORIA] Where the heck
did those little punks go?

00:10:22.645 --> 00:10:24.414
[DODORIA]
Show yourselves!

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:33.533
[KRILLIN] As long as we
keep our energy suppressed,

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:34.669
we should be safe here...

00:10:34.702 --> 00:10:35.771
It's a good thing
that village elder

00:10:35.804 --> 00:10:37.274
destroyed the
Scouters when he did.

00:10:37.307 --> 00:10:39.813
Cagey old guy really
saved our butts, y'know?

00:10:39.846 --> 00:10:40.714
Those things can detect

00:10:40.748 --> 00:10:42.284
the smallest bit of power.

00:10:42.317 --> 00:10:43.987
Even the Namekian kid.

00:10:47.562 --> 00:10:48.931
[DODORIA]
Agh...!

00:10:48.964 --> 00:10:50.834
How am I supposed to find
these puny little kids...?

00:10:50.868 --> 00:10:53.405
Come on out, you
stinking punks!

00:10:55.878 --> 00:10:56.980
[GOHAN]
Check it out...!

00:10:57.013 --> 00:10:58.751
Looks like he's
giving up and leaving!

00:10:58.784 --> 00:10:59.986
[KRILLIN] Hmmm...

00:11:05.497 --> 00:11:07.801
[DODORIA] I'll just
level the place.

00:11:30.313 --> 00:11:32.183
[DODORIA] There... That
oughtta do it... See...?

00:11:32.217 --> 00:11:34.956
That's what you get for
messing with Dodoria!

00:11:39.364 --> 00:11:41.736
[DODORIA] Frieza did say to
bring 'em back to him but...

00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:43.206
what was I supposed to do...?

00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:45.176
I wish I'd found out
who they were, though...

00:11:45.209 --> 00:11:47.581
Heh... They had
some fight in 'em.

00:11:48.182 --> 00:11:49.819
[DODORIA] Guess it
doesn't matter now...

00:11:49.852 --> 00:11:51.155
Whoever they were,
I have a feeling

00:11:51.188 --> 00:11:54.027
they won't be
bothering us anymore.

00:11:56.967 --> 00:11:58.737
[GOHAN]
We're safe.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.943
[KRILLIN] That
was a close one...

00:12:01.976 --> 00:12:04.314
Now let's head back and
see if we can find Bulma.

00:12:04.348 --> 00:12:07.989
[KRILLIN] Hey... So...
uh, think you can fly?

00:12:08.022 --> 00:12:09.992
[DENDE]
I think so.

00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:15.804
[DENDE] Sir... Thank
you for putting yourself

00:12:15.837 --> 00:12:17.708
in danger to
try to save me.

00:12:17.742 --> 00:12:18.910
[KRILLIN]
Well... actually,

00:12:18.944 --> 00:12:20.246
you should be
thanking Gohan.

00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:22.719
I was too scared to help,
but he jumped right in.

00:12:23.052 --> 00:12:24.321
[GOHAN]
Well... Maybe...

00:12:24.354 --> 00:12:26.292
But I never could've
pulled it off by myself...

00:12:26.325 --> 00:12:29.064
You really came
through for us, Krillin!

00:12:30.768 --> 00:12:32.137
[KRILLIN]
Yeah, well...

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.874
The important thing is,
is that we're all still here...

00:12:33.907 --> 00:12:35.711
You should probably stick
with us for a little while.

00:12:35.744 --> 00:12:37.480
What do ya say?

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.052
[DENDE]
You mean...?

00:12:43.192 --> 00:12:45.062
[DENDE]
Okay.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:47.901
[BULMA]
I was right, Dad.

00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:49.606
Dragon Balls are
on Planet Namek!

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:51.008
The problem is
those big alien jerks

00:12:51.042 --> 00:12:52.311
already found
most of them,

00:12:52.344 --> 00:12:53.880
which means they've
got them heavily guarded,

00:12:53.914 --> 00:12:56.084
which means this whole trip
is completely pointless!

00:12:56.118 --> 00:12:57.655
What am I even doing here?

00:12:57.688 --> 00:12:58.991
What use is a
delicate flower like me

00:12:59.024 --> 00:13:02.097
on a brutal alien
death-scape like this, right?

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.803
[BULMA] Are you even
listening...? Answer me!

00:13:04.836 --> 00:13:06.673
[BRIEFS] I'm listening.
I'm listening!

00:13:06.707 --> 00:13:09.679
'Delicate flower,'
absolutely... Go on.

00:13:09.713 --> 00:13:11.082
[BULMA]
Anyways...

00:13:11.115 --> 00:13:12.718
All I'm saying is things
here couldn't get much worse.

00:13:12.752 --> 00:13:14.321
[BULMA] And unless I can
get the spaceship fixed,

00:13:14.355 --> 00:13:15.591
we can't come home!

00:13:15.624 --> 00:13:18.463
[BRIEFS] You wanna
come home already?

00:13:18.496 --> 00:13:19.666
But why...?

00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:20.834
It took you a whole
month to get there.

00:13:20.868 --> 00:13:22.938
And besides...
Goku is on his way.

00:13:22.972 --> 00:13:25.944
He just left here
heading in your direction.

00:13:25.978 --> 00:13:26.846
[BULMA] You're kidding...!

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.015
Goku's coming to Namek...?

00:13:28.048 --> 00:13:29.484
Well why didn't
you say so?

00:13:29.518 --> 00:13:30.621
That's great...!

00:13:30.654 --> 00:13:32.892
That's incredible...!
That's awesome!

00:13:32.925 --> 00:13:33.994
[BRIEFS] Gee, you
never get this excited

00:13:34.027 --> 00:13:35.463
when I come to visit.

00:13:35.496 --> 00:13:39.672
Yes, he's scheduled to
arrive six days from now.

00:13:39.706 --> 00:13:41.342
[BULMA] We're saved!

00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:43.212
[BRIEFS]
Bulma...? Hello?

00:13:45.049 --> 00:13:46.720
[DODORIA] Damn...
This is impossible...

00:13:46.753 --> 00:13:48.055
I don't know how
we're ever going to find

00:13:48.088 --> 00:13:50.459
the other two Dragon Balls
without our Scouters.

00:13:50.493 --> 00:13:52.898
[DODORIA] Well... at least
it's not that big of a planet.

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:54.101
Not many places to--

00:13:54.134 --> 00:13:55.302
[thud]

00:13:55.436 --> 00:13:57.541
[splash]

00:14:11.068 --> 00:14:15.777
[VEGETA]
Ha ha ha ha...

00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:18.349
[DODORIA] Vegeta...!
What do you want?

00:14:18.383 --> 00:14:19.484
[VEGETA]
Dodoria...

00:14:19.518 --> 00:14:22.123
What kind of a greeting
is that for an old friend?

00:14:22.792 --> 00:14:24.094
[DODORIA] Do you
really think you can

00:14:24.127 --> 00:14:26.833
just blindside me like
that and get away with it?

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:27.902
[VEGETA] And what
will you do...?

00:14:27.935 --> 00:14:29.137
You're all alone now...

00:14:29.171 --> 00:14:32.077
not hanging around with
Frieza and Zarbon, huh?

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:33.814
[VEGETA]
How unfortunate!

00:14:33.847 --> 00:14:34.882
[VEGETA]
After all...

00:14:34.915 --> 00:14:35.984
Without Frieza
here to intervene,

00:14:36.018 --> 00:14:38.590
getting rid of
you should be easy.

00:14:38.624 --> 00:14:39.592
[DODORIA]
What...?

00:14:39.626 --> 00:14:40.994
You think you
can take me...?

00:14:41.028 --> 00:14:44.234
Not in a million lifetimes,
you little Saiyan freak!

00:14:48.943 --> 00:14:50.179
[DODORIA]
Come on...

00:14:50.213 --> 00:14:51.516
I don't think you really
want to challenge me...

00:14:51.549 --> 00:14:53.787
And, believe it or not,
I don't wanna fight you...

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.590
So why don't you just
give me that Scouter

00:14:55.624 --> 00:14:57.961
and we can both
walk away? Deal?

00:14:57.995 --> 00:14:59.063
[VEGETA]
I see...

00:14:59.097 --> 00:15:00.366
I knew something
must have gone wrong

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.772
when I heard your audio
feeds go to static...

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:03.873
You went and let them

00:15:03.907 --> 00:15:06.044
destroy your
Scouters, didn't you?

00:15:07.849 --> 00:15:09.184
[VEGETA]
Perfect...

00:15:09.218 --> 00:15:12.558
That assures that I'll have
the element of surprise.

00:15:12.592 --> 00:15:14.494
[DODORIA] You...
Now listen--!

00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:17.935
[VEGETA] A trip
back to Planet Frieza

00:15:17.968 --> 00:15:21.843
for more Scouters
would cost several days.

00:15:21.876 --> 00:15:24.113
[VEGETA]
Here... Want this?

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.157
[DODORIA] Smartest
thing you've done yet.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.930
It's about time you
showed me a little respect.

00:15:31.963 --> 00:15:33.499
[DODORIA] I was
gonna take it anyway,

00:15:33.534 --> 00:15:34.502
but since
you offered,

00:15:34.535 --> 00:15:37.106
I might have to go
easy on you after all.

00:15:43.954 --> 00:15:45.557
[crunch]

00:15:51.435 --> 00:15:55.176
[DODORIA] Vegeta...
How... how could you?

00:15:55.209 --> 00:15:56.479
[DODORIA]
What'd you wanna go

00:15:56.513 --> 00:15:58.516
and break the thing for?

00:15:59.284 --> 00:16:00.419
[VEGETA]
Because it was worth

00:16:00.453 --> 00:16:02.390
so much more to you
than it was to me.

00:16:02.423 --> 00:16:04.027
[DODORIA]
What...? No way...!

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.597
Without that thing
beepin' at you,

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.633
you can't tell
where Frieza

00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:08.803
or the Dragon Balls
are any more than I can!

00:16:08.837 --> 00:16:10.941
[VEGETA] I'm afraid
you're wrong...

00:16:10.974 --> 00:16:12.277
During my
time on Earth,

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.347
I was lucky enough to
pick up a few new tricks,

00:16:14.381 --> 00:16:16.218
like how to detect
an opponent's energy

00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:19.592
and location without
having to resort to gadgets.

00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:20.359
Yes...

00:16:20.392 --> 00:16:21.896
I first saw
it demonstrated

00:16:21.929 --> 00:16:23.934
by one of the
planet's inhabitants...

00:16:23.967 --> 00:16:27.006
who happened to
be another Saiyan.

00:16:27.039 --> 00:16:30.412
[VEGETA] And if he could
do it, so could I, right?

00:16:32.718 --> 00:16:34.388
[VEGETA] It's really a
pretty simple technique

00:16:34.421 --> 00:16:35.791
once you get
the hang of it...

00:16:35.824 --> 00:16:37.293
But it doesn't
require much strength,

00:16:37.327 --> 00:16:38.530
and I know how
you and Frieza

00:16:38.563 --> 00:16:41.770
are only interested
in flexing your muscles.

00:16:41.803 --> 00:16:43.172
[VEGETA]
Then again...

00:16:43.205 --> 00:16:46.044
There's nothing wrong with
an occasional show of force.

00:16:47.113 --> 00:16:48.181
[DODORIA]
Hey, I get it...

00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:49.652
Those two little
runts I was chasing

00:16:49.686 --> 00:16:51.055
were Earthlings,
weren't they?!

00:16:51.088 --> 00:16:52.223
[VEGETA]
What did you say?

00:16:52.256 --> 00:16:53.492
[DODORIA] I'm right,
aren't I...?

00:16:53.526 --> 00:16:55.931
You and them are
working together!

00:16:55.964 --> 00:16:57.934
[VEGETA] You must
be mistaken...

00:16:57.968 --> 00:16:59.304
Even if the
earthlings found a way

00:16:59.337 --> 00:17:01.441
to make it all the
way to Planet Namek...

00:17:01.474 --> 00:17:03.011
I'd have sensed
their presence...

00:17:03.045 --> 00:17:04.815
And believe me,
when that day comes,

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:06.184
I'll make them pay!

00:17:06.218 --> 00:17:08.022
[DODORIA] I don't care about
your stupid vendetta...!

00:17:08.055 --> 00:17:09.659
If you don't have
another Scouter on you,

00:17:09.692 --> 00:17:11.061
you're just wasting my time!

00:17:11.094 --> 00:17:13.432
[DODORIA] Now get lost...
Or you're dead!

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.137
[DODORIA] This is a once-in-
a-lifetime opportunity...

00:17:16.171 --> 00:17:18.810
so take it...!
Get outta here!

00:17:18.843 --> 00:17:20.179
[VEGETA] That's
generous of you...

00:17:20.213 --> 00:17:23.385
Or are you just
scared to attack me?

00:17:23.419 --> 00:17:26.024
[VEGETA] Yes...
That must be it.

00:17:26.057 --> 00:17:27.594
[VEGETA] When you
overheard my battle with Cui,

00:17:27.628 --> 00:17:30.099
you realized that I'm
considerably stronger

00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:32.236
than I was before.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.843
And now you're terrified!

00:17:35.644 --> 00:17:38.348
[VEGETA] You saw it on
your Scouter, didn't you?

00:17:38.382 --> 00:17:40.620
[VEGETA] You're weak
compared to me.

00:17:40.654 --> 00:17:41.756
[DODORIA]
No...

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:43.660
There's no way that power
reading was accurate...!

00:17:43.694 --> 00:17:44.928
You can't be that strong!

00:17:44.962 --> 00:17:47.133
[DODORIA] And
I'll prove it!!...!

00:17:58.523 --> 00:18:00.326
[VEGETA] I warned you
not to underestimate me...

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.798
but you chose
not to listen.

00:18:10.647 --> 00:18:13.720
[VEGETA] You're even
slower than I remember!

00:18:13.821 --> 00:18:17.595
[DODORIA]
Arrrghh!

00:18:17.628 --> 00:18:19.130
[VEGETA] We Saiyans
grow a little stronger

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:20.366
with each battle...

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:22.403
But you already knew
that, didn't you...?

00:18:22.437 --> 00:18:24.575
That's why... when
I was defeated on Earth...

00:18:24.609 --> 00:18:27.380
I became stronger than
I ever thought possible!

00:18:27.413 --> 00:18:30.186
[VEGETA] It's impressive,
isn't it...? Just admit it!

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.388
[DODORIA]
Stop it!

00:18:31.421 --> 00:18:32.592
[VEGETA] I've been
fighting and improving.

00:18:32.625 --> 00:18:35.429
While you've been
getting lazy and soft.

00:18:38.436 --> 00:18:39.672
[DODORIA]
Vegeta... Wait...!

00:18:39.706 --> 00:18:41.676
I know something you're
really gonna wanna hear,

00:18:41.709 --> 00:18:43.980
and if you let me go, I promise
I'll tell you all about it!

00:18:44.014 --> 00:18:45.182
[DODORIA] It's about
your homeworld...

00:18:45.216 --> 00:18:47.186
I know the truth
about Planet Vegeta!

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.355
[VEGETA]
You what?

00:18:48.389 --> 00:18:50.026
What did you say...?
Planet Vegeta...?

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:51.996
What could you possibly
know about it...?

00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:53.332
Start talking!

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:54.536
[DODORIA]
I will...!

00:18:54.569 --> 00:18:56.639
I will, but first
you have to let me go!

00:19:05.223 --> 00:19:06.258
[DODORIA]
Hey...

00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:07.761
What kind of
guarantee do I have

00:19:07.794 --> 00:19:10.099
you're not gonna take me out
as soon as I've told you, huh?

00:19:10.132 --> 00:19:11.969
[VEGETA] I guarantee
that I will end you

00:19:12.003 --> 00:19:13.807
if you do not talk...!
Spit it out!

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.075
[DODORIA]
Okay, calm down.

00:19:15.109 --> 00:19:16.512
You don't have to get
all huffy about it...

00:19:16.546 --> 00:19:18.983
Frieza told you Planet
Vegeta had been destroyed...

00:19:19.016 --> 00:19:22.190
and that's true... but his
story about it being crushed

00:19:22.223 --> 00:19:23.660
by a meteor was a lie.

00:19:23.693 --> 00:19:25.063
[VEGETA] What are
you talking about?

00:19:25.096 --> 00:19:26.498
[DODORIA] Frieza knew
that no one Saiyan

00:19:26.533 --> 00:19:28.435
could ever get in his
way, but a whole bunch

00:19:28.468 --> 00:19:30.741
of them together
could cause problems.

00:19:30.774 --> 00:19:31.709
[DODORIA]
The thing is...

00:19:31.743 --> 00:19:33.178
he noticed more and
more Saiyan babies

00:19:33.212 --> 00:19:36.519
being born with highly
developed combat skills.

00:19:36.553 --> 00:19:37.555
Like you.

00:19:37.588 --> 00:19:39.525
A group of infant
warriors might grow up

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:41.629
into a strong
Saiyan army someday,

00:19:41.663 --> 00:19:44.868
and you wouldn't stay
loyal to Frieza forever.

00:19:44.902 --> 00:19:46.104
[DODORIA]
He had a choice...

00:19:46.137 --> 00:19:47.742
Either see what happened
when you got older,

00:19:47.775 --> 00:19:49.377
or wipe out the only
race that would ever

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:51.516
be powerful enough
to oppose him...

00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:53.385
It was a tough call...
But in the end,

00:19:53.419 --> 00:19:56.860
I think he came to the
only logical conclusion.

00:19:56.893 --> 00:19:58.162
[DODORIA]
Destroy them.

00:19:58.195 --> 00:20:00.133
And to make sure the
job was done right,

00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:01.468
Frieza did it himself.

00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:02.938
He blew up Planet Vegeta

00:20:02.971 --> 00:20:04.842
and every stinkin'
Saiyan on it.

00:20:04.876 --> 00:20:05.877
[DODORIA]
But not you.

00:20:05.911 --> 00:20:08.082
No, Frieza had
plans for you.

00:20:08.115 --> 00:20:09.350
The prince
of the Saiyans

00:20:09.384 --> 00:20:11.756
would make a valuable
addition to his team.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.160
Did you really think
it was coincidence

00:20:14.193 --> 00:20:16.332
that Frieza sent
you to another planet

00:20:16.365 --> 00:20:18.570
before yours exploded?

00:20:18.603 --> 00:20:19.304
Hehehehehehe...

00:20:19.337 --> 00:20:20.573
So there it is...

00:20:20.607 --> 00:20:22.544
You're finally in on our
little private joke...

00:20:22.578 --> 00:20:24.147
Why don't you just
take a minute to let

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:26.720
that sink in while I let
Frieza know you're here?

00:20:26.753 --> 00:20:29.324
[VEGETA] I'll be alright...
but... you won't.

00:20:29.358 --> 00:20:30.593
[DODORIA]
Wha--?

00:20:30.627 --> 00:20:32.063
[VEGETA] I don't care
about my home planet,

00:20:32.097 --> 00:20:34.001
my family, or any
of the other Saiyans

00:20:34.034 --> 00:20:35.571
Frieza did away with.

00:20:35.604 --> 00:20:37.206
[VEGETA] I'm just
disappointed in myself

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.010
for not figuring
it out a lot sooner.

00:20:39.043 --> 00:20:40.346
If I had known,
I never would've wasted

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.251
my life doing all
of your dirty work!

00:20:44.387 --> 00:20:46.525
[DODORIA] Frieza!

00:21:01.154 --> 00:21:02.090
[VEGETA] Interesting.

00:21:02.123 --> 00:21:03.458
Even the mighty Frieza trembles

00:21:03.492 --> 00:21:06.498
at what the Saiyans
are capable of.

00:21:08.068 --> 00:21:10.039
[GOKU] Okay...
Here we go...

00:21:10.072 --> 00:21:11.509
I've gotta beat
this 20-times gravity

00:21:11.542 --> 00:21:14.013
or I won't have a
chance on Namek.

00:21:17.487 --> 00:21:19.558
[GOKU] I don't have
any time to waste!

00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:21.161
[NARRATOR] Goku is
ready for action,

00:21:21.195 --> 00:21:23.332
and getting
stronger by the minute...

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:26.104
but across the galaxy,
Vegeta is training, too...

00:21:26.137 --> 00:21:30.046
and the day they meet in
combat is fast approaching...

00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:33.519
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:35.156 --> 00:21:45.342
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:37.346 --> 00:22:38.650
[GOKU] Hey, it's Goku!

00:22:38.683 --> 00:22:40.687
I've got five and a half
days 'til I get to Namek,

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.824
and I've still got
to get a lot stronger!

00:22:42.857 --> 00:22:44.160
[KRILLIN] Well,
step on it, okay?

00:22:44.194 --> 00:22:45.396
Vegeta's here, too!

00:22:45.429 --> 00:22:46.665
[GOHAN] He's trying
to find the Dragon Balls

00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:48.870
before Frieza does, but
Frieza already has five!

00:22:48.903 --> 00:22:50.473
That means there
are only two left!

00:22:50.507 --> 00:22:51.474
[KRILLIN]
I sense him...

00:22:51.509 --> 00:22:52.711
He's attacking
another village!

00:22:52.744 --> 00:22:55.483
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:22:55.517 --> 00:22:57.453
"Vegeta's Covert Manuevers!

00:22:57.486 --> 00:22:59.691
A Tragic Assault
on the Namekians!"

00:22:59.725 --> 00:23:01.361
[GOHAN] I hope you
get here soon, Dad!

00:23:01.395 --> 00:23:03.599
I made a friend
I want you to meet!
