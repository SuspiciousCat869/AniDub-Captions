00:22:48.703 --> 00:22:52.410
Besides, Bulma, only training
is gonna make me stronger.

00:22:52.443 --> 00:22:54.548
Next time on
Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:58.489
"A New Guardian! The Return
of the Dragon Balls!"

00:22:58.523 --> 00:23:00.527
It'd be nice if we could
wish for victory,

00:23:00.561 --> 00:23:03.699
but it'll be a lot more
fun to win it myself!
