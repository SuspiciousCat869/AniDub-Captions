Last Dragon Ball Z Kai...

00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:05.077
Vegeta went on the offensive,

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.181
and seized a Dragon
Ball for himself...

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:09.451
Meanwhile, on the run
from Frieza's men...

00:00:09.485 --> 00:00:12.926
Krillin and Dende raced to
protect the final Dragon Ball

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.732
before it, too, fell
into enemy hands.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:18.303
With five Dragon Balls
already in his possession,

00:00:18.336 --> 00:00:20.407
Frieza is dangerously close

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.946
to realizing his wish
for immortality.

00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:26.319
Can he be stopped?
Find out...now!

[Narrator] "Friends Reborn!

00:01:54.897 --> 00:01:58.637
Zarbon's Hideous
Transformation!"

00:02:30.568 --> 00:02:36.378
Okay, good. I'd say I got this
twenty-times setting licked.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.787
So, time to crank this
bad boy up to thirty.

00:02:40.522 --> 00:02:46.667
[Kai] Hello out there? Can you
hear me? Come in, Goku...

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.539
Hey! Wait a second.
King Kai, is that you?

00:02:49.573 --> 00:02:52.812
[Kai] Indeed! The voice that
launched a thousand ships...

00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:55.584
Speaking of which, I have
to ask: why exactly are you

00:02:55.618 --> 00:02:58.389
soaring through outer space
in a refurbished pod?

00:02:58.423 --> 00:03:01.496
Oh, wait, yes, of course.
Planet Namek. The Dragon Balls.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.603
Silly me. I should've guessed.
Happy hunting to you.

00:03:04.636 --> 00:03:05.938
Happy hunting?

00:03:05.972 --> 00:03:08.409
Haven't you heard the news about
all the crazy stuff goin' on?

00:03:08.443 --> 00:03:10.782
Bulma said that every
bad guy in the galaxy

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:11.918
is gathered on Namek.

00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:13.353
Sounds just terrible.

00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:16.158
Well, you'll have to tell
me all about it later.

00:03:16.192 --> 00:03:19.331
You see. Right now,
I'm entertaining.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:22.071
[Goku] What are you talkin'
about? You mean guests?

00:03:22.104 --> 00:03:24.241
[Kai] Uh-huh. But not
just any guests.

00:03:24.274 --> 00:03:26.613
These guys beat your Snake
Way record by a mile.

00:03:26.647 --> 00:03:29.084
Hard to believe, but
here they are...

00:03:29.117 --> 00:03:30.855
in a fraction of
the time you took.

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.226
All four of them, in fact.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.563
[Goku] Wait, four of them?

00:03:34.596 --> 00:03:36.934
[Kai] But, I guess if your
old record's gotta give,

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:39.906
best it's broken by friends...

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.676
[Goku] Are you kidding me?

00:03:46.587 --> 00:03:48.524
I'd watch out if I were you;

00:03:48.558 --> 00:03:51.763
these fellas are out to one-up
your old training regimen, too.

00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:55.504
That... That's incredible!

00:03:55.538 --> 00:03:59.045
So all four made it to your
place at the same time, huh?

00:03:59.078 --> 00:04:00.715
Are they with you right now?

00:04:00.748 --> 00:04:02.685
Hey, is it cool
if I speak to him?

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.457
[Kai] Sure. Just place
a hand on my shoulder

00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:07.695
and gab to your
heart's content.

00:04:08.597 --> 00:04:10.701
[Ya,cha] Yo. You
hear me alright, Goku?

00:04:10.734 --> 00:04:11.770
[Goku] Yamcha?!

00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:13.774
Just so happens we ran
into Kami on this side.

00:04:13.807 --> 00:04:16.647
He told us all about King
Kai and how to find him.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.949
Yep...

00:04:17.982 --> 00:04:21.255
And, dude...The old guy also
told us what you were up to...

00:04:21.288 --> 00:04:23.561
About headin' to he and
Piccolo's home world

00:04:23.594 --> 00:04:25.531
to try and scare up
some new Dragon Balls

00:04:25.564 --> 00:04:27.769
and bring the four
of us back...

00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:31.276
If you made it to King Kai's...
Then I know Tien sure did...

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:33.581
Hey, what about
Piccolo? Is he there?

00:04:33.614 --> 00:04:35.316
[Yamcha] Oh yeah, he's here.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.122
As if there's any way
my pride would allow me

00:04:38.155 --> 00:04:40.929
to sit this one out, while
everyone else got stronger.

00:04:40.962 --> 00:04:43.701
[Goku] So who's the other
one with you? Is it Kami?

00:04:43.734 --> 00:04:44.869
No, 'fraid not...

00:04:44.903 --> 00:04:47.776
Kami decided to stay
behind back in Other World...

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:49.145
Get this: it's Chiaotzu!

00:04:49.178 --> 00:04:51.115
[Goku] Are you
kidding me? No way...

00:04:51.148 --> 00:04:54.354
I thought Chioatzu got blown
to smithereens! He's okay?

00:04:54.388 --> 00:04:55.858
[Yamcha] Yeah, he's fine.

00:04:55.891 --> 00:04:58.496
Kami gave him a brand new body
and everything. Good as new.

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:02.037
That's awesome!
Way to go, Chiaotzu!

00:05:04.374 --> 00:05:05.945
Man, I don't know
how you handled

00:05:05.978 --> 00:05:07.481
trainin' on this planet.

00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:10.554
I mean the gravity's so strong
here, we can barely even run.

00:05:10.588 --> 00:05:12.123
Oh, you'll get used
to it. Trust me.

00:05:12.157 --> 00:05:13.326
You should see
what I'm doin' now.

00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:14.996
I've only got five
days left to train

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.569
before I get to Planet Namek.
I have the artificial gravity

00:05:17.602 --> 00:05:19.839
on this rig set so high
it's not even funny.

00:05:19.873 --> 00:05:22.679
Unless I'm stronger than I've
ever been by the time I land...

00:05:22.713 --> 00:05:24.616
I'm gonna be in some
serious trouble...

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:27.789
Wait. Whaddya mean?
You have to fight somebody?

00:05:27.822 --> 00:05:29.659
Well, 'cause I was
hurt so badly,

00:05:29.692 --> 00:05:32.532
Gohan, Krillin and Bulma had
to go to Namek without me,

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:33.801
figuring that'd be our best bet

00:05:33.835 --> 00:05:35.437
at trackin' down some
new Dragon Balls, but...

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.909
Then...Right after they got
there... Vegeta showed up

00:05:37.942 --> 00:05:40.313
with the same thing in
mind. And he's not alone.

00:05:40.347 --> 00:05:41.783
What...?!

00:05:41.817 --> 00:05:44.021
Please just tell me they didn't
get themselves pulverized!

00:05:44.054 --> 00:05:46.627
No. Lucky for the three of
them, it doesn't look like

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.631
he even knows they're
there... at least not yet.

00:05:48.664 --> 00:05:50.535
Still... It's complicated...

00:05:50.568 --> 00:05:53.541
Turns out he's just part of
somethin' a whole lot worse...

00:05:53.574 --> 00:05:55.745
A lot of other pretty
mean-looking guys,

00:05:55.778 --> 00:05:57.481
are also there for
the Dragon Balls.

00:05:57.515 --> 00:05:59.485
The strange thing is,
they're all wearin'

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:02.390
the exact same kinda
uniforms as Vegeta...

00:06:02.424 --> 00:06:04.563
And...Apparently they're
being led by a guy...

00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:06.366
whose power level
makes the rest of them

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:07.668
look like they're a
bunch of weaklings.

00:06:07.702 --> 00:06:09.238
Ah! What?!

00:06:09.272 --> 00:06:12.043
What is it? What's
Goku saying to you?

00:06:12.077 --> 00:06:15.283
Uh... You wouldn't happen to
know their leader's name...

00:06:15.316 --> 00:06:16.218
by some chance?

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.555
[Goku] No clue.

00:06:17.588 --> 00:06:19.726
I'll pass it on the second
I hear anything, though.

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:24.569
[Kai] If it's who I think it is,
we've got major issues.

00:06:24.603 --> 00:06:28.410
Say, Goku, uh... Stand by,
I'm gonna have a little peek.

00:06:28.443 --> 00:06:30.480
Yeah sure...Lemme
know whatcha see!

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:31.850
[Kai] Alrighty then.

00:06:31.884 --> 00:06:36.626
Which direction is good ol'
Planet Namek anyway...?

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.131
Yamcha...You gonna
fill us in or what?

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:55.899
Well...There is some
serious power down there,

00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:56.934
that's for certain...

00:06:56.967 --> 00:06:59.539
Now if I can only focus
in on the source...

00:07:08.824 --> 00:07:10.561
No!

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:14.670
Frieza!

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.577
[Goku] What's the matter?
You recognize who it is?

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.850
Ah, Goku... Saying you don't
know who you're up against here,

00:07:21.883 --> 00:07:24.321
would bar none be the
understatement of the decade!

00:07:24.354 --> 00:07:26.359
There's no way you can
take on this fiend!

00:07:26.392 --> 00:07:28.463
Wh-What's that
supposed to mean?

00:07:28.496 --> 00:07:29.866
[Kai] Listen to me carefully;

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:32.739
you're not to go anywhere
near him! That's an order!

00:07:32.772 --> 00:07:35.343
When you land on Namek, just
gather up Gohan and your pals

00:07:35.376 --> 00:07:37.247
and get out of there
as quickly as possible!

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.554
[Kai] I'm not just saying this
for your sake, either.

00:07:40.588 --> 00:07:43.259
Family. Loved ones.
The Earth itself--

00:07:43.292 --> 00:07:45.765
not to mention countless other
worlds--would be at risk...

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:48.303
So much as look at him wrong
and Frieza's wrath will engulf

00:07:48.336 --> 00:07:51.041
everything you, me and anyone
on our side holds dear!

00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:54.048
[Kai] Just this once you must
leave well enough alone...

00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:55.784
Wow, if he's so powerful...

00:07:55.818 --> 00:07:57.622
can't I at least get
a look at the guy?

00:07:57.655 --> 00:08:00.961
No you cannot "get a look at
the guy"! That's an order!

00:08:00.995 --> 00:08:01.964
Come on...

00:08:01.997 --> 00:08:05.070
I am the King Kai!

00:08:05.237 --> 00:08:06.773
Hm?

00:08:08.543 --> 00:08:10.715
No. Don't listen to him, Goku.

00:08:10.748 --> 00:08:13.419
Find the Dragon Balls and wish
us back, whatever it takes.

00:08:13.453 --> 00:08:14.956
Now we're talking...

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.663
Believe me when I tell you that
my time here won't go to waste.

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:21.603
Just get me to Planet Namek
and we'll teach this Frieza

00:08:21.637 --> 00:08:23.741
the true meaning of
the word wrath.

00:08:24.408 --> 00:08:28.817
What?! Not one of you has the
first inkling about Frieza!

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.521
[Piccolo] Well, then I guess
you'd better start training us,

00:08:30.554 --> 00:08:31.523
shouldn't you?

00:08:31.556 --> 00:08:32.892
[Kai] Not with that attitude.

00:08:32.925 --> 00:08:34.929
Not unless you swear to
stay clear of Namek!

00:08:34.962 --> 00:08:38.871
Give me your word. Or I'll
refuse to teach you a thing!

00:08:38.904 --> 00:08:39.940
Yeah, fine.

00:08:39.973 --> 00:08:44.048
I can trust you, right?
You wouldn't... lie?

00:08:44.081 --> 00:08:46.553
[Kai] That condition goes
for everyone, by the way!

00:08:46.587 --> 00:08:48.423
You hear me... I am
the King Kai...

00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:53.567
[Piccolo] Ha-ha. An easy promise
to keep... Or work around...

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.136
[Tien] I can't outshine Goku

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.973
if I stick to the
same regimen he did.

00:08:57.007 --> 00:08:59.679
Not with so little time.
I'm gonna have to put

00:08:59.712 --> 00:09:02.651
my own spin on the training,
if I want to get ahead...

00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:10.032
Well...Let's begin, shall we?

00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:15.812
[Tien] Here we go...

00:09:15.845 --> 00:09:18.048
[Yamcha] Let's do this!

00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:28.269
Now... The test...

00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:31.108
You must each tell a clever
joke that will make me laugh.

00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:35.082
But I warn you: my sense of
humor is quite... refined.

00:09:38.422 --> 00:09:41.730
Alright. So I'm not supposed to
tangle with what's-his-name.

00:09:41.763 --> 00:09:43.767
But there's no harm in
me gettin' stronger.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.938
Let's see if I can handle
kicking this thing up

00:09:45.971 --> 00:09:48.175
to fifty-times the
gravity of Earth!

00:09:51.081 --> 00:09:54.054
Hey... So, uh... We keep
flyin' like this...

00:09:54.087 --> 00:09:56.559
How long before we get
to the Grand Elder?

00:09:56.593 --> 00:09:59.799
Uh, should be just
another five hours or so.

00:10:02.805 --> 00:10:05.912
Dammit! Why the hell am I not
picking up any power levels

00:10:05.945 --> 00:10:08.216
clustered together?
This is ridiculous!

00:10:08.249 --> 00:10:11.054
There has to be another
village somewhere!

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:15.531
[Vegeta] Two
powers on the move...

00:10:15.564 --> 00:10:17.735
Odd. One of
them feels different

00:10:17.768 --> 00:10:21.810
from any of Frieza's men
or the Namekians...

00:10:21.843 --> 00:10:25.316
Whatever it is... I should
leave nothing to chance.

00:10:29.659 --> 00:10:31.061
[Krillin] Dende, stop!

00:10:31.095 --> 00:10:33.868
It's Vegeta! He's
picked up our energy

00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:37.107
And he's not far! We
have seconds, maybe!

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.346
Hurry up, Dende!
We've got to hide!

00:11:02.023 --> 00:11:05.764
That was weird. Why'd
he change direction?

00:11:08.469 --> 00:11:10.874
Somethin' nearby's got
a lot of energy.

00:11:10.908 --> 00:11:12.812
And Vegeta's headed
straight for it!

00:11:12.845 --> 00:11:16.318
There's no mistaking that
power. Ha! Not at all!

00:11:16.351 --> 00:11:19.225
Lucky me. I've been
waiting for you to separate

00:11:19.258 --> 00:11:21.696
from the herd, Zarbon!

00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:40.901
Ugh... Come on! Trying to locate
these primitive dwellings

00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:43.105
without a scouter
is such a chore...

00:11:46.478 --> 00:11:47.548
What the...?

00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:49.117
[Zarbon] Vegeta!

00:11:53.961 --> 00:11:57.535
Yo... It's been quite awhile
hasn't it, Pretty Boy?

00:11:57.568 --> 00:11:58.903
I hope you didn't forget me.

00:11:58.937 --> 00:12:00.508
Nothing jump-starts
the ol' memory

00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:02.077
like a grudge match, though.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.683
Dodoria would agree,
if he weren't dead.

00:12:04.716 --> 00:12:06.720
What?! You--You can't have
defeated him.

00:12:06.754 --> 00:12:07.922
You're bluffing me!

00:12:07.955 --> 00:12:11.428
[Vegeta laughing]
Don't believe me, huh?

00:12:11.461 --> 00:12:12.999
I find it hard.

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:14.969
Ah, a skeptic, I see. Well...

00:12:15.003 --> 00:12:18.042
fortunately the burden of proof
can be shouldered right here.

00:12:18.075 --> 00:12:20.748
I'm sure it can. But
answer me this first:

00:12:20.781 --> 00:12:22.050
why would you turn against us?

00:12:22.084 --> 00:12:25.056
Against Frieza, you mean?
Isn't it obvious?

00:12:25.089 --> 00:12:27.160
I hate the bastard.
Always have.

00:12:27.194 --> 00:12:29.699
And now that there's a chance,
not to just seize eternal life,

00:12:29.733 --> 00:12:32.805
[Vegeta] but to wrench free of
his control at the same time.

00:12:32.839 --> 00:12:35.611
Well the real question
is why in my right mind

00:12:35.644 --> 00:12:37.514
wouldn't I turn against him?

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:39.919
You're a fool to
speak this way.

00:12:39.952 --> 00:12:42.223
You're the fool for
being Frieza's lapdog...

00:12:42.257 --> 00:12:45.196
And if he thinks I'll be kind
once the Dragon Balls are mine,

00:12:45.229 --> 00:12:48.570
then your precious master is
the biggest fool of them all!

00:12:48.604 --> 00:12:51.074
[Zarbon] Surely even someone
as thick as you knows

00:12:51.108 --> 00:12:53.981
it'll take more than
immortality to conquer Frieza.

00:12:54.014 --> 00:12:56.451
It's a pity you can't
manage without a scouter.

00:12:56.485 --> 00:12:58.991
I think you'd be truly bowled
over at the kind of power

00:12:59.024 --> 00:13:01.094
my experience on the
battlefield has forged.

00:13:01.128 --> 00:13:05.136
[laughing] My, my...
Such conviction...

00:13:05.169 --> 00:13:08.041
Please... Frieza's power
utterly transcends any notion

00:13:08.075 --> 00:13:10.279
you or I could have
of "experience."

00:13:10.312 --> 00:13:13.621
Enough talk! Your nonsense
doesn't intimidate me!

00:13:13.654 --> 00:13:15.924
I know his weakness! See...

00:13:15.957 --> 00:13:19.832
I've become what Frieza most
fears! A powerful Saiyan!

00:13:19.866 --> 00:13:22.003
A Saiyan before
whom he will kneel!

00:13:22.037 --> 00:13:25.343
Is that what you believe?
Frieza may once have bristled

00:13:25.376 --> 00:13:27.346
at the idea of your
kind banding together,

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.554
but... Just one of you is
hardly what I'd call a threat.

00:13:30.587 --> 00:13:33.593
Oh? Really?

00:14:05.991 --> 00:14:09.230
What?! How could he
have deflected that?

00:14:12.004 --> 00:14:15.176
Whoa! Now that is
some serious power!

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.151
Vegeta and one of those thugs
must be really going at it...

00:14:19.184 --> 00:14:21.656
I'll bet it's that one guy...
the one with the hair

00:14:21.689 --> 00:14:23.994
who was standin'
next to Frieza...

00:14:24.027 --> 00:14:26.331
Yeah... It's him alright--
it's gotta be...

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:29.038
Let's just hope he and Vegeta
keep each other occupied.

00:14:29.071 --> 00:14:30.908
I'd be useless against
either one of them

00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:34.081
if they came after
us... Hey, that's it!

00:14:34.114 --> 00:14:35.717
Now's our chance!
Sorry about this.

00:14:35.751 --> 00:14:38.189
While those two are over there
beating each other to a pulp...

00:14:38.222 --> 00:14:41.094
I can fly us over to the Grand
Elder's place at full speed.

00:14:41.127 --> 00:14:42.197
Vegeta should be
way too distracted

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.268
to notice the energy spike.

00:14:44.301 --> 00:14:45.904
Hold on!

00:14:47.508 --> 00:14:51.081
[Vegeta laughing] This can't be
the best you've got! I thought

00:14:51.115 --> 00:14:54.588
the mighty Zarbon's speed was
supposed to be legendary!

00:15:09.184 --> 00:15:11.488
[Vegeta laughing]
How disappointing!

00:15:11.523 --> 00:15:14.427
I thought you'd be
more of a challenge.

00:15:23.246 --> 00:15:27.387
[Zarbon] Bravo, Vegeta.
Your progress intrigues me.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.759
Enough so that I feel it's
only courtesy to show you

00:15:29.792 --> 00:15:31.428
the extent of my own power,

00:15:31.462 --> 00:15:34.434
something I've let lay
dormant for many years.

00:15:37.073 --> 00:15:41.148
[Vegeta] What? Dormant? Well
now you've got me intrigued.

00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:45.524
Has Frieza's peacock been
keeping his feathers tucked?

00:15:47.093 --> 00:15:50.066
Believe me... You've no clue.

00:15:50.099 --> 00:15:51.401
[Vegeta] Really...

00:15:51.435 --> 00:15:53.807
[laughing]

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.278
Such a sense of humor!

00:15:56.613 --> 00:15:59.417
You might as well know before
you breathe your last breath...

00:15:59.451 --> 00:16:03.158
there's a very good reason I
keep my full powers hidden.

00:16:03.192 --> 00:16:06.365
You see, exploiting them calls
for a drastic transformation.

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:10.406
Quite a distasteful one,
in fact... hideous, even.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.280
Naturally... I am somewhat
reluctant to sacrifice looks...

00:16:14.314 --> 00:16:17.888
But, when my hand has been
forced, what choice is there?

00:16:17.922 --> 00:16:19.291
Excellent.

00:16:19.324 --> 00:16:21.328
Next you'll be telling me
you become a giant ape...

00:16:21.361 --> 00:16:24.400
[laughing] Of all the
lies I've heard people use

00:16:24.434 --> 00:16:27.440
when backed into a corner,
I think yours is my favorite!

00:16:27.474 --> 00:16:30.981
Well... I don't become huge,
not like you Saiyans do.

00:16:31.014 --> 00:16:34.487
Nevertheless... once I've
properly transformed...

00:16:37.528 --> 00:16:39.531
my power's enormous!

00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:42.671
[Krillin] It sure feels like
a lot of time's passed since

00:16:42.705 --> 00:16:45.476
we got to this planet. Longer
than a single day, I mean.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:48.583
Why hasn't the sun started
to go down yet, you know?

00:16:48.616 --> 00:16:49.952
Just kinda weird.

00:16:49.985 --> 00:16:51.455
Um... Which one?

00:16:52.324 --> 00:16:54.595
We have three suns...
They each set in turn,

00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:57.033
but there's always at
least one in the sky.

00:17:02.076 --> 00:17:05.183
So, there's no such thing
as night on this world?

00:17:05.216 --> 00:17:06.752
[Dende] What's night?

00:17:08.623 --> 00:17:10.225
Ah... nevermind...

00:17:11.963 --> 00:17:13.432
I'm waiting...

00:17:15.203 --> 00:17:19.010
Eager, aren't we? Very well.

00:17:19.043 --> 00:17:21.549
Don't say you weren't warned.

00:17:25.891 --> 00:17:27.761
Ah! What the hell...?!

00:17:32.037 --> 00:17:33.540
Repulsive, isn't it?

00:17:33.574 --> 00:17:38.081
Oh but the trade-off in power is
unbelievable... as you will see!

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:56.318
Dende, 'bout how much further

00:17:56.352 --> 00:17:58.590
'til we get to the Grand
Elder's house would ya say?

00:17:58.623 --> 00:17:59.926
Not much farther now.

00:17:59.959 --> 00:18:01.596
Good. 'Cause something
tells me the brawl

00:18:01.629 --> 00:18:04.434
between Vegeta and that other
guy isn't gonna last long...

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:11.682
No! I won't lose!

00:18:44.682 --> 00:18:47.888
Fight back all you want. It
just makes this more fun for me!

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.822
Wow. That battle
must be insane!

00:19:04.856 --> 00:19:06.859
I can still feel
their energy.

00:19:22.357 --> 00:19:24.595
Ugly as it is, in
this form I'm capable

00:19:24.628 --> 00:19:27.400
of snapping your
neck like a twig!

00:19:37.588 --> 00:19:39.759
[Vegeta] It's no use...
I was a fool to think

00:19:39.792 --> 00:19:42.597
Earth had prepared me
for something like this...

00:19:56.625 --> 00:19:59.832
[Zarbon] Let's put you
out of your misery!

00:20:10.754 --> 00:20:14.695
"Thought I'd be more of
a challenge." Ha! Idiot.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.588
Water, water everywhere... but
dammit... no sign of a body.

00:20:27.621 --> 00:20:30.025
Must have been swept
away by the current.

00:20:40.313 --> 00:20:43.218
So much trouble. I can't
believe I was provoked

00:20:43.251 --> 00:20:45.857
into transforming by the
likes of him... I suppose

00:20:45.891 --> 00:20:49.297
I should report our little
skirmish to Lord Frieza, though.

00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:10.139
This... isn't... over...
I'm not done...

00:21:10.173 --> 00:21:12.276
I'll get stronger...

00:21:12.309 --> 00:21:14.381
stronger than either of you...

00:21:14.414 --> 00:21:18.957
You and Frieza will
tremble at my feet...!

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.998
You'll pay... when...
the Dragon Balls are mine!

00:21:24.467 --> 00:21:26.906
[Narrator] Zarbon's true
form has been revealed...

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.545
Do Goku and the others
stand a chance against

00:21:29.578 --> 00:21:34.789
such powerful enemies... Find
out, next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:35.156 --> 00:21:45.342
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:38.082 --> 00:22:39.450
[Goku] Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:39.484 --> 00:22:42.089
Man, fifty-times the gravity
of Earth is a workout!

00:22:42.122 --> 00:22:43.893
[Dende] The Grand Elder's
benevolence and wisdom

00:22:43.926 --> 00:22:46.532
have no bounds. I know if
we explain what's going on,

00:22:46.566 --> 00:22:47.768
he'll grant your request.

00:22:47.801 --> 00:22:48.936
[Krillin] Well, I sure
hope you're right...

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.472
'cause one way or
another we gotta try

00:22:50.507 --> 00:22:51.809
and hide the Dragon
Ball he's got.

00:22:51.842 --> 00:22:54.782
If Frieza or Vegeta get
the drop on us, it's over!

00:22:54.815 --> 00:22:57.052
[Goku] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:22:57.086 --> 00:23:01.061
"Power Up, Krillin! Frieza's
Mounting Apprehension!"

00:23:01.094 --> 00:23:04.500
[Krillin] Whoa! My strength
is going through the roof!
