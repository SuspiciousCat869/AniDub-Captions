The efforts to stop Cell

Having claimed his prize,
the ruthless android

first training with Piccolo...

00:02:18.744 --> 00:02:22.184

see what he meant!

He's right...

But one thing I can do--

00:09:47.542 --> 00:09:50.413
I can still sense power levels
with the best of 'em.

00:09:50.514 --> 00:09:52.383
And just now...
when Cell hit me,

flash of the power

below the surface...

It's the most terrifying
thing I've ever seen!

Cell's power has
increased significantly...

[ANDROID 16] However...
compared to Vegeta,

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:36.806
it appears he is still
at a clear disadvantage...

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.848
I'm tellin' you, the power
we're sensing right now

00:10:40.948 --> 00:10:42.618
is only a drop
in the bucket...

00:10:42.718 --> 00:10:44.487
No--a drop in the ocean...

00:10:44.588 --> 00:10:47.194
and any second he could
kick open the flood gates...

00:10:47.294 --> 00:10:49.364
but he's holding back,
Trunks. Same as you.

00:10:49.464 --> 00:10:51.769
Uh! So you mean
you could tell?

00:10:57.648 --> 00:11:00.554
So... you actually did
manage to power up a bit...

Good, then maybe this won't
be a complete waste of time.

so it's no surprise that he
wouldn't notice, but me...?

You're hiding your

And I think I know why.

00:11:27.407 --> 00:11:28.511
It's because...

00:11:28.611 --> 00:11:30.848
you've become even
stronger than Vegeta...

Hm!

No question. Dad's on
a whole different level

now than he was before.

00:12:10.895 --> 00:12:12.030
[TRUNKS] He trained
to the limits of

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.202
his Super Saiyan abilities,
but he hit a plateau.

00:12:15.302 --> 00:12:16.606
Not me.

to break through the barrier
that he couldn't cross.

on the defensive...

My initial assessment

[ANDROID 16] He is growing

You really think you can delay
the inevitable forever, Cell?

[VEGETA] Obviously, your
"perfect form" is a joke!

You still don't have
what it takes to defeat me

You're afraid to fight!

yours and prove it!

Mmm.

[VEGETA] Fool...
I am Super Vegeta,

[KRILLIN]
Are you kidding me?!

00:16:31.348 --> 00:16:32.885
Vegeta just hit him
full force!

00:16:32.985 --> 00:16:35.557
A kick like that should
have sent Cell flying!

00:16:35.657 --> 00:16:39.097
But it's like...
it didn't even phase him...

00:16:39.197 --> 00:16:41.936
C'mon, don't you see
what we're up against here?!

00:16:42.036 --> 00:16:43.606
I'd say that was
your cue, Trunks!

00:16:43.706 --> 00:16:46.378
Time to bust out that
secret power of yours!

00:16:46.478 --> 00:16:48.082
No, I can't...

00:16:48.182 --> 00:16:50.353
No way is Dad gonna
let me or anyone else

00:16:50.453 --> 00:16:51.623
interfere at this point.

even allow it.

That's... crazy!

I did not see Cell make
even the slightest effort

00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:21.314
to deflect Vegeta's attack;
he just absorbed it.

00:17:21.414 --> 00:17:23.252
[ANDROID 16] And it appears
he suffered no damage

difference in their powers

be over.

something right now...

how much stronger

see it as arrogance,

down at the core,
