Touring these out/lying
sectors is relaxing, isn t it?

00:13:27.147 --> 00:13:31.355
You re going to burn your
cybernetics clear away, my son.

00:13:31.455 --> 00:13:34.996
[KING COLD] Your opponent can t
have gotten you this worked up.

00:13:35.096 --> 00:13:39.238
[FRIEZA] Forgive me, Father--
I just can t contain myself.

00:13:39.338 --> 00:13:44.281
I m so excited
I could just explode.

00:13:44.381 --> 00:13:46.285
[UNDERLING E]
King Cold, Prince Frieza...

00:13:46.385 --> 00:13:49.157
permission to initiate
landing procedures!

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:56.940
Frieza s ship will be landing
around here any minute now.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.376
Yeah? How do you know?

00:13:58.476 --> 00:14:00.614
How do I know?!
Let me think about it!

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:04.287
[VEGETA] I ve actually fought
him-- can you say the same?

00:14:07.093 --> 00:14:09.666
[BULMA OVER A LOUD SPEAKER]
Surpriiiiiise!

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.969
[YAMCHA]
Is that Bulma?!

00:14:13.172 --> 00:14:14.809
Hey Vegeta--hey Yamcha!

00:14:14.909 --> 00:14:18.115
Hope you guys
don t mind us dropping in!

00:14:25.329 --> 00:14:26.733
Down we go

00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:28.135
Yamcha, I missed you so mu--!

00:14:28.235 --> 00:14:30.507
W-what are you doing here?!
Are you both crazy?!

00:14:30.607 --> 00:14:32.044
We wanna see Frieza in action...

00:14:32.144 --> 00:14:33.980
Heck, I went all the
way to Planet Namek

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.984
and I never even caught
a glimpse of the guy!

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:37.621
Seriously? Do you know how

00:14:37.721 --> 00:14:39.759
insanely dangerous
he is, Bulma?!

00:14:39.859 --> 00:14:41.461
Well, duh--of course I do.

00:14:41.562 --> 00:14:43.098
I mean, if Frieza
put his mind to it,

00:14:43.198 --> 00:14:46.104
he could pop this planet
like a water balloon, right?

00:14:46.204 --> 00:14:48.208
[BULMA] Might as well have
a front-row seat!

00:14:48.308 --> 00:14:53.018
I wanna see if Frieza
lives up to the hype.

00:14:53.118 --> 00:14:54.956
[VEGETA THINKS]
She s vulgar--and quite possibly

00:14:55.056 --> 00:14:57.928
color-blind-- but
the woman has guts.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.368
[YAMCHA]
It s Tien! And Chiaotzu!

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:06.947
So Vegeta... You ve decided to
show your face on Earth again.

00:15:07.047 --> 00:15:09.184
That s all you have to say?

00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:11.188
[TIEN] Hardly... but I ve
always thought,

00:15:11.288 --> 00:15:14.227
actions speak
louder than words.

00:15:14.327 --> 00:15:18.302
How can you stand
the sight of him, Yamcha?

00:15:18.503 --> 00:15:19.204
Bring it on!

00:15:19.304 --> 00:15:20.273
Fine!

00:15:20.373 --> 00:15:22.177
Whoa, hey! Cool it!
This isn t the time!

00:15:22.277 --> 00:15:24.481
[YAMCHA]
Ok Tien, c mon.

00:15:30.827 --> 00:15:34.234
I feel it, whatever it is...
You think it s Frieza?

00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:35.938
Yeah, that s how it s looking.

00:15:36.038 --> 00:15:37.173
Enough talk...!

00:15:37.273 --> 00:15:38.242
Do you fools want
them to discover us,

00:15:38.342 --> 00:15:39.778
mask your power levels...!

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:42.618
Frieza s minions can use their
Scouters to track us down.

00:15:42.718 --> 00:15:45.725
At least the Namekian s
keeping a low profile.

00:15:45.825 --> 00:15:47.694
The who?

00:15:47.795 --> 00:15:49.532
[YAMCHA]
Piccolo!

00:15:49.632 --> 00:15:53.205
He s so close...
and I didn t sense a thing!

00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:58.016
Gohan...!
Take a look down there!

00:15:58.116 --> 00:15:59.719
Even Piccolo showed up!

00:15:59.819 --> 00:16:03.392
[KRILLIN] Guess we re not
the only ones who felt it!

00:16:04.127 --> 00:16:05.296
Hey, guys!

00:16:05.396 --> 00:16:09.038
Yoo-hoo! Krillin,
Gohan--we re over here!

00:16:09.138 --> 00:16:12.343
Gohan...! Is Goku back?!

00:16:15.116 --> 00:16:18.957
Oh no, If he s still gone
when Frieza gets here

00:16:19.057 --> 00:16:21.261
He s here!

00:17:04.548 --> 00:17:05.651
They're landing!

00:17:05.751 --> 00:17:07.754

[UNDERLING E] Landing

00:17:41.021 --> 00:17:43.626
You may disembark
at your leisure.

00:17:57.521 --> 00:18:01.596
Yup, no doubt about it...
That s Frieza...

00:18:01.696 --> 00:18:03.566
He... he s still alive.

00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:04.969
Not only that

00:18:05.069 --> 00:18:09.712
ut there s somebody else with
im who s even... more powerful !

00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:15.389
Listen up! Nobody
is allowed to fly!

00:18:15.489 --> 00:18:16.626
[VEGETA]
We re going in on foot,

00:18:16.726 --> 00:18:20.366
so we can keep our
power levels hidden!

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:21.068
All set?

00:18:21.168 --> 00:18:22.638
Yeah!

00:18:23.707 --> 00:18:25.276
[YAMCHA]
Piccolo, wait !

00:18:25.376 --> 00:18:27.146
Let me get this straight:
Frieza s the most

00:18:27.246 --> 00:18:30.119
powerful opponent any
of us has ever seen, right?

00:18:30.219 --> 00:18:32.157
Uh-huh, but it gets
way worse than that...

00:18:32.257 --> 00:18:35.129
Cause he can get even
stronger than he is right now!

00:18:35.229 --> 00:18:36.999
Please, tell me
you re pulling my leg !

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.172
So what s the point of us
sneaking up on the ship, then?

00:18:40.272 --> 00:18:41.743
We re nothing but bugs to him!

00:18:41.843 --> 00:18:43.278
Seriously, Tell me I m wrong!

00:18:43.378 --> 00:18:45.551
[YAMCHA] And this time,
he s brought a friend!

00:18:45.651 --> 00:18:48.523
How on Earth are we
going to defeat this guy?

00:18:48.623 --> 00:18:51.529
[PICCOLO]
Would you quit whining.

00:18:52.363 --> 00:18:54.835
If you d prefer to run and hide,
then suit yourself...

00:18:54.935 --> 00:18:58.643
But we already know
what s lies in store for us.

00:19:02.384 --> 00:19:04.187
Are you finally catching on?

00:19:04.287 --> 00:19:07.493
[VEGETA]
Your backwater planet is doomed!

00:19:08.663 --> 00:19:11.167
[WIND BLOWS]

[METAL DOORS OPENING]

00:19:29.539 --> 00:19:33.445
So this is Earth ?
I ve destroyed worse.

00:19:33.546 --> 00:19:37.387
We didn t come all this way
to toy with Earthlings, my son

00:19:37.487 --> 00:19:40.092
we re here for that
Super Saiyan who hurt you...

00:19:40.192 --> 00:19:42.531
Yes, we ll punish
him most severely.

00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:44.268
Anyone in the universe
who threatens

00:19:44.368 --> 00:19:47.406
our supremacy must be
utterly conquered!

00:19:47.507 --> 00:19:49.679
Well, between the two of us,
Father, I m sure we could

00:19:49.779 --> 00:19:52.818
make him kneel to us-- but I m
stronger than I was before,

00:19:52.918 --> 00:19:56.191
so I might be able to vanquish
him all by my lonesome.

00:19:56.291 --> 00:19:57.894
I m afraid the opponent
you re so eager to

00:19:57.994 --> 00:20:01.870
face won t be home for
another three hours, Freiza.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:03.405
Shall we wait for him?

00:20:03.506 --> 00:20:05.443
[FRIEZA]
Without a doubt, Father.

00:20:05.544 --> 00:20:08.349
But I want to crush his spirit
before I finish him off.

00:20:08.449 --> 00:20:11.756
Maybe wiping out the Earthlings
would be a nice touch.

00:20:11.856 --> 00:20:14.596
[FRIEZA] How many can we get
in three hours?

00:20:14.696 --> 00:20:17.801
I guess there s
only one way to find out.

Hurry, Goku! Hurry!

I ve crawled back
from the humiliation

00:20:25.884 --> 00:20:29.658
you dealt me to wreak
my revenge upon you!

00:20:41.682 --> 00:20:43.352
[YAMCHA] Why bother
wishing me back to Earth

00:20:43.452 --> 00:20:46.659
if I m just going to have
to leave again ?

00:20:48.295 --> 00:20:51.435
[FRIEZA] Move out, men! And when
you encounter the Earthlings,

00:20:51.536 --> 00:20:53.540
well... you know what to do.
