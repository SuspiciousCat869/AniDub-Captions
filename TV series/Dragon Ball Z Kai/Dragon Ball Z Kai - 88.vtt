this turn of events
defies belief, but...

at the fact!

Mighty Hercule, sir...

and inglorious defeat?

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:02.244
[HERCULE] Look, little man:
I'm hardly defeated--

Yes, well...

yourself, I suppose;

[GOKU] Yeah,
well we'll see.

Mighty Hercule,

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:11.035
though pushed outside
the ring in a twinkling

00:04:11.102 --> 00:04:12.839
during his first
bout with Cell,

00:04:12.906 --> 00:04:14.809
has assured this
reporter the scoundrel

00:04:14.876 --> 00:04:16.780
is due for a
spectacular comeuppance.

00:04:16.847 --> 00:04:18.450
[ANNOUNCER] Yet while
our hero takes a break,

00:04:18.518 --> 00:04:19.953
a member of
the ragtag group

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.823
who ignored his
warning has ventured--

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.061
foolhardily--into the
ring to test his mettle

00:04:24.128 --> 00:04:27.134
against this fearsome foe.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.038
[ANNOUNCER] Alas,
fools will be fools...

00:04:29.104 --> 00:04:31.175
Sad but true: that
is the lesson here...

00:04:31.242 --> 00:04:34.014
Still, having observed
these rank amateurs...

00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:35.952
Your thoughts on how long it
will take them to founder?

00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:37.990
[HERCULE]
Heh heh heh...

00:04:38.056 --> 00:04:40.193
You're just being
rhetorical, right...?

I've seen great-grandmas
with better form

00:04:42.097 --> 00:04:44.301

circus clown up there.

00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:45.403
[HERCULE]
Heh...

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.973
If it was me this nobody
was lockin' horns with,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.544
I'd have him bawlin'
for his binkie

00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:50.180
in two seconds flat.

00:04:50.246 --> 00:04:51.415
[HECULE] Rookie ought
to be locked away

00:04:51.482 --> 00:04:54.923
in a nuthouse
for his own good.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.727
[HERCULE] I give the guy
five seconds in the ring,

00:04:56.794 --> 00:04:58.196
if even that...

00:04:58.262 --> 00:04:59.165
So, yeah...

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:02.538
Not much of a
breather for me, huh?

00:05:02.605 --> 00:05:05.043
[ANNOUNCER] Maybe just enough
time for a single exhale!

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.245
[HERCULE] Well, hey at
least the folks at home

00:05:06.312 --> 00:05:08.183
get a little sideshow
to whet their appetites

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:11.222
for some real fightin',
eh? Hahahahahaha!

00:05:13.527 --> 00:05:15.564
[YAMCHA] Goku's
never been like this.

00:05:15.831 --> 00:05:18.269
[TIEN] Yea, I know...
He's so relaxed.

00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:20.473
[KRILLIN] That's
putting it mildly...

00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:22.178
Look at him for
cryin' out loud:

00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:23.279
from his stance you'd think

00:05:23.346 --> 00:05:25.518
this was an
exercise or something.

00:05:25.585 --> 00:05:27.454
[PICCOLO] Heh...
Safe to say he's been

00:05:27.522 --> 00:05:29.926
looking forward to this
little sparring match.

00:05:29.993 --> 00:05:31.028
[TRUNKS] Which
just goes to show

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:33.333
how confident he really
is in his own powers.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.370
That has to be a
good sign, right?

00:05:48.162 --> 00:05:49.532
[CELL]
Well?

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:24.368

Yeah! Forfeit!

00:06:24.435 --> 00:06:25.771
[YAMCHA]
He's done!

00:06:32.618 --> 00:06:33.721
[CELL]
Nice one...

00:06:33.788 --> 00:06:37.227
Enjoy that little taste
of victory while you can.

00:06:37.294 --> 00:06:38.396
[GOKU]
Heh...

00:06:38.463 --> 00:06:40.601
Don't know why you'd even
bother messing around...

00:06:40.668 --> 00:06:42.204
It's not like
you're fooling anyone.

00:06:42.271 --> 00:06:45.109
We all know you're way too
strong to go down that easy.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.383
[CELL] Just
getting my kicks.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.719
As long as you're
holding out on me

00:06:49.786 --> 00:06:52.559
I see no harm in getting
some enjoyment from this.

00:06:52.626 --> 00:06:55.731
[GOKU] Like I've seen
your full power yet.

00:06:55.798 --> 00:06:56.733
[CELL]
Oh don't worry:

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.071
you'll see what
I'm capable of...

00:06:59.138 --> 00:07:02.244
I'd just prefer to
showcase it incrementally.

00:07:02.311 --> 00:07:03.981
[GOKU]
I can't wait.

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:15.872

say no to a challenge...

00:07:18.176 --> 00:07:20.715
Must be that Saiyan blood.

00:07:20.782 --> 00:07:23.085
[GOKU] Guess you and I
are a lot alike that way.

00:07:24.756 --> 00:07:26.727
[CELL] I do enjoy
a good battle.

00:07:26.794 --> 00:07:28.095

[GOHAN]
What is he doing?

00:08:11.983 --> 00:08:13.688
[GOHAN] If dad was
fighting like he meant it,

00:08:13.754 --> 00:08:15.156
he wouldn't
be this sloppy.

00:08:15.223 --> 00:08:16.024
[TRUNKS]
What...?

00:08:16.091 --> 00:08:17.160

00:12:25.891 --> 00:12:26.893
[HERCULE]
Yeah...!

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.164
They probably go to
the same magic school.

00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:30.534
[KRILLIN] This
is gettin' ugly...

00:12:30.601 --> 00:12:33.439
From here on, they're gonna
go full power all the way...

00:13:11.215 --> 00:13:12.016
[CELL]
Go on.

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:13.085
[GOKU]
Alright.

00:13:20.233 --> 00:13:22.638
[CELL]
Heh heh heh...

00:13:22.705 --> 00:13:24.374
Nicely done, Goku.

00:13:24.441 --> 00:13:27.514
This is exactly the contest
I've been searching for!

00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:29.786
[CELL] After all,
what's the fun in fighting

00:13:29.852 --> 00:13:32.758
if the outcome is a
foregone conclusion?

00:13:35.698 --> 00:13:39.004
[GOKU] Yeah...
I agree with you there.

00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:41.843
<i>[VEGETA] Is... is this
Kakarot's true power?</i>

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.649
<i>I don't believe it!
He's, he's...</i>

00:13:44.716 --> 00:13:46.318
[TRUNKS]
Awesome...

00:13:46.384 --> 00:13:49.090
I didn't think anyone's
strength could be this massive.

00:13:49.157 --> 00:13:51.495
[KRILLIN] He's really pouring
it on thick, isn't he...?

00:13:51.563 --> 00:13:53.031
That's Goku for you!

00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:56.472
<i>[GOHAN] Why is everybody
so blown away by this...?</i>

00:13:56.539 --> 00:13:58.743
<i>I mean, sure, it's
impressive, but...</i>

00:14:43.701 --> 00:14:45.403
[ANNOUNCER] We have
just observed a tussle

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.775
of unimaginable velocity...
Your impression?

00:14:47.842 --> 00:14:48.943
[HERCULE]
Uhm?

00:14:51.148 --> 00:14:53.887
Not too shabby!
Hahahaha!

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:05.476
[CELL]
Hmmm... Heh heh heh...

00:15:05.544 --> 00:15:12.825
Hahahahahaha!!

00:15:13.794 --> 00:15:16.566
[CELL] Brace
yourself, Goku.

00:15:17.066 --> 00:15:17.935
[TIEN] What's
he gonna do?!

00:15:18.002 --> 00:15:18.803
[YAMCHA]
That's not good!

00:15:31.696 --> 00:15:33.199
[CELL]
Multi-Form!

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.504
[TIEN]
Hey... not fair!

00:15:47.728 --> 00:15:48.697
[GOKU]
Sorry...

00:15:48.763 --> 00:15:50.935
That technique's not
going to work on me.

00:15:51.001 --> 00:15:52.270
[CELL]
Is that so?

00:15:56.746 --> 00:15:57.648
[TIEN]
No way...!

00:15:57.715 --> 00:15:59.051
Splitting your body
four ways like that

00:15:59.117 --> 00:16:00.787
would normally decrease
your total strength

00:16:00.854 --> 00:16:02.090
by at least half!

00:16:02.157 --> 00:16:03.861
[YAMCHA] And his strength
hasn't even changed...

00:16:03.927 --> 00:16:04.929
He's got the
same power level

00:16:04.996 --> 00:16:06.332
as when he
was one dude.

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:08.335
[TIEN] Yeah...
I hate to admit this,

00:16:08.402 --> 00:16:10.273
but Cell's mastered
that trick far better

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.709
than I ever could.

00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:25.871
[CELL] So, then...

00:16:25.938 --> 00:16:28.275
Have a newfound appreciation
of my power, do we?

00:16:28.776 --> 00:16:31.749
[GOKU] Oh yeah...
Not bad.

00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:36.927
[CELL] Don't worry,
it gets better.

00:16:36.993 --> 00:16:38.028
I haven't
even come close

00:16:38.095 --> 00:16:40.399
to unleashing my
ultimate power...

00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:42.672
[GOHAN]
Wait isn't that--?

00:16:42.739 --> 00:16:44.642
[PICCOLO] Yeah,
he's stealing my move.

00:16:46.278 --> 00:16:47.648
[CELL]
Heads up!

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.101
[GOKU]
It's about time.

00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:06.051
[GOKU] Just needed you
four to spread out a bit.

00:17:06.118 --> 00:17:10.292
[crashes]

00:17:13.767 --> 00:17:15.503
[KRILLIN]
Ha! Oh yeah!

00:17:21.482 --> 00:17:22.951
[CELL]
Destructo Disk!

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:29.665
[KRILLIN]
What the--?!

00:17:29.732 --> 00:17:30.399
[YAMCHA] Whoa, Krillin,
are you able to guide

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:31.769
your attack like that...?

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:49.271
[CELL] Ha...! You'll have
to do better than this...

00:17:49.338 --> 00:17:51.375
The knowledge I've inherited
from Frieza tells me

00:17:51.441 --> 00:17:54.915
you'll try to charge
toward me and veer away...

00:17:54.982 --> 00:17:56.318
However...

00:17:56.385 --> 00:17:58.523
It won't work!

00:18:03.265 --> 00:18:05.837
[CELL] You're using
the Afterimage technique.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.614
[GOKU] I hope you're
not really expecting

00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:12.852
to win by using
other people's moves...

00:18:12.918 --> 00:18:14.689
Sorry it won't happen.

00:18:14.756 --> 00:18:17.761
[CELL] Hmmm...
Perhaps you're right...

00:18:17.828 --> 00:18:20.900
I should finish off
with something unique.

00:18:22.838 --> 00:18:25.143
<i>[GOKU] He's raising his
power level to its limit...</i>

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:26.445
<i>What's he got planned?!</i>

00:18:26.512 --> 00:18:31.956
[CELL]
Ka... me...

00:18:32.023 --> 00:18:33.425
[KRILLIN]
Huh?!

00:18:33.492 --> 00:18:34.762
[GOKU] No!
Don't do it, Cell!

00:18:34.829 --> 00:18:36.532
Firing a Kamehameha
like that at full power

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:38.002
could destroy
the whole planet!

00:18:38.068 --> 00:18:43.011
[CELL]
Ha...

00:18:45.015 --> 00:18:46.619
[VEGETA]
He, he's doing it!

00:18:46.686 --> 00:18:50.560
[CELL]
Me...!

00:18:51.428 --> 00:18:53.966
[CELL]
Ha!!

00:18:54.802 --> 00:18:56.906
[GOKU]
Hey, Cell...! Up here!

00:19:30.808 --> 00:19:31.776
[CELL]
Int'resting...

00:19:31.842 --> 00:19:33.713
That blast should
have hit you square on;

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.182
how did you manage
to deflect it?

00:19:35.249 --> 00:19:37.554
[GOKU] Yeah, well...
I didn't really.

00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:38.656
[CELL]
Ah, yes...

00:19:38.723 --> 00:19:40.325
Your ability to
pop out of one place

00:19:40.392 --> 00:19:42.798
and into another
as if by magic.

00:19:43.499 --> 00:19:45.369
[GOKU] Instant
transmission...

00:19:45.436 --> 00:19:47.173
Handy...
If you know how.

00:19:47.641 --> 00:19:49.878
[CELL]
You don't say...?

00:19:49.945 --> 00:19:53.687
I can see this technique
is going to be a nuisance...

00:19:53.754 --> 00:19:55.590
[GOKU] Hey...
Question...

00:19:55.657 --> 00:19:56.892
If I hadn't flown
up into the sky,

00:19:56.959 --> 00:19:58.262
would you have
still fired anyway,

00:19:58.329 --> 00:20:00.032
even though it meant
destroying the earth...?

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:01.603
Seriously.

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:03.038
[CELL] Yeah,
possibly...

00:20:03.105 --> 00:20:04.776
But, I also knew
you'd have no choice

00:20:04.842 --> 00:20:06.612
but to take to the air.

00:20:06.679 --> 00:20:08.784
[GOKU] Heh heh...
So that's it...

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.622
Bet you think you're
pretty clever, don't you?

00:20:11.689 --> 00:20:13.893
[CELL] I think you fail
to understand, Goku...

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.396
Whether or not this
planet gets destroyed

00:20:15.463 --> 00:20:18.637
means absolutely
nothing to me.

00:20:18.704 --> 00:20:20.740
[CELL] Sure, things
might get a bit dull...

00:20:20.807 --> 00:20:22.778
But... So be it!

00:20:36.338 --> 00:20:38.943
[CELL] Don't tell me I'm
suddenly too fast for you...

00:20:40.146 --> 00:20:42.150
[NARRATOR] Cell is
inconceivably swift.

00:20:42.217 --> 00:20:43.753
Can Goku
outmaneuver him?
