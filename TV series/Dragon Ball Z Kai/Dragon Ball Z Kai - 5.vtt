Wilderness Survival! A Moonlit
Night Awakens Gohan

00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:36.425
[wind blowing]

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.203
So.. What now?.. uh, I mean..
How do.. I train?

00:01:58.303 --> 00:02:02.713
For now.. you don't have to do
anything.. Just survive.

00:02:02.813 --> 00:02:06.620
Survive?

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.126
After six months.. if you've
managed to stay alive..

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:13.232
I'll teach you how to fight.

00:02:15.237 --> 00:02:17.140
Y-You're leaving
me?!.. You can't!..

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.947
I can't stay out here
all by myself! Alone!

00:02:20.047 --> 00:02:24.088
You won't be by yourself..
No.. You'll have plenty of..

00:02:24.188 --> 00:02:27.227
hungry wild animals..to
keep you company.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:32.104
You mean like..
lions and tigers?..

00:02:32.204 --> 00:02:33.908
but they'll eat me!

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:35.979
Quiet!.. No more whining!..

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.651
It's time to start acting
like a man.. Understand?!

00:02:38.751 --> 00:02:40.822
But.. what do I do?

00:02:40.922 --> 00:02:43.360
Whatever it takes to stay
alive for six months.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.798
If you can find a way to do
that, then at the end...

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.438
You'll be a stronger fighter--
both in body and in mind.

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.411
Remember this.. There's a
great power inside you,

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:53.814
just waiting to be unlocked..

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:56.419
but it's up to you to
bring it out. Use it!..

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.124
Believe in your ability!
If you want to survive,

00:02:59.224 --> 00:03:00.695
you'll need to learn how
to summon your powers

00:03:00.795 --> 00:03:01.964
whenever you need them.

00:03:02.064 --> 00:03:04.468
But.. what if I..can't?

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:05.804
Heh.

00:03:05.905 --> 00:03:08.443
Wait!.. What am I supposed to
eat? I don't have any food!

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:10.949
Or water!... Or a bath!..
Or a bed! Or anything--!

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.621
I guess that's something you're
just gonna have to figure out.

00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:16.425
I never said this
would be easy.

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:18.731
This is the path that
fate has chosen for you.

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:21.803
The sooner you accept
it, the better.

00:03:22.773 --> 00:03:24.408
Wait!..

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.655
Stop! Don't go! You
can't leave me here!...

00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:34.763
Come back! I don't know
what to do all by myself!

00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:57.608
Kami?.. What is it?.. Is
something troubling you?

00:04:00.548 --> 00:04:04.523
It's Piccolo.. I can still
feel the evil in his heart,...

00:04:04.623 --> 00:04:07.228
and yet... there seems to be
a change coming over him,

00:04:07.328 --> 00:04:08.631
Mr. Popo...

00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:12.171
He is not acting like the
villain I would expect.

00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:14.976
(ah) It is odd... The
old King Piccolo

00:04:15.076 --> 00:04:17.982
never would have been willing
to train Goku's son.

00:04:18.082 --> 00:04:21.089
Yes.. I found it equally
surprising when he agreed to

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:23.995
forge an alliance with Goku,
in order to fight Raditz.

00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:26.867
I realize he had his own selfish
motives for doing so...

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:28.436
But still...

00:04:28.537 --> 00:04:32.211
it does not change the fact that
he chose to defend the Earth...

00:04:32.311 --> 00:04:34.248
<i>And though it may
seem Piccolo's</i>

00:04:34.348 --> 00:04:36.319
<i>true evil nature
revealed itself</i>

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.061
<i>when he eliminated Goku
along with Raditz...</i>

00:04:41.162 --> 00:04:45.236
<i>We must not forget, that Goku
chose to make that sacrifice..</i>

00:04:45.337 --> 00:04:46.774
<i>Not only that...</i>

00:04:46.874 --> 00:04:49.880
<i>but he can be easily revived
with the Dragon Balls...</i>

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.053
<i>Piccolo knows that Goku
is certain to return,</i>

00:04:53.153 --> 00:04:56.259
<i>and yet he has still
chosen to train his son --"</i>

00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:57.696
<i>a boy that may one
day grow to be a</i>

00:04:57.796 --> 00:05:00.066
<i>powerful enemy in
his own right...</i>

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:03.874
[Mr Popo] When you put it that
way.. it doesn't make sense...

00:05:03.974 --> 00:05:08.249
Perhaps it does, Mr.
Popo.. Perhaps it does..

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.253
Piccolo may have
realized as I have,

00:05:10.353 --> 00:05:13.392
that in one year, we will die.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.398
No.. Kami...

00:05:17.568 --> 00:05:20.407
I'm sorry, Mr. Popo.. but
I have foreseen it...

00:05:20.508 --> 00:05:23.614
I do not know the exact
cause of our passing...

00:05:23.714 --> 00:05:26.485
<i>whether Piccolo will lose
his life to the Saiyans,</i>

00:05:26.586 --> 00:05:28.423
<i>or if I will simply
succumb to old age.</i>

00:05:28.524 --> 00:05:30.460
<i>But the result is the same.</i>

00:05:30.561 --> 00:05:33.433
<i>My life force is forever
bound with Piccolo's.</i>

00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:35.638
<i>We are two halves
of the same being.</i>

00:05:35.738 --> 00:05:38.544
<i>One cannot exist
without the other...</i>

00:05:38.644 --> 00:05:43.286
Hmhmhmhm You might say
it's...the curse of foresight:

00:05:43.386 --> 00:05:46.492
seeing the day...
of my own demise.

00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:48.998
If Piccolo has sensed my mind..

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:52.605
He may wish to pass his
knowledge on before he dies..

00:05:52.705 --> 00:05:56.278
Even.. if it's to the
son of his own enemy.

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:58.750
But.. What about..
the Dragonballs?

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.925
They.. will vanish..
along with me...

00:06:04.228 --> 00:06:07.569
<i>[Goku] Wow. I had no idea
Gohan was so strong!</i>

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.806
<i>What he did against Raditz
today was amazing!</i>

00:06:09.906 --> 00:06:12.912
I guess he's a chip of the
old block after all!

00:06:18.055 --> 00:06:19.693
Huh... Wait a sec!..

00:06:19.793 --> 00:06:22.464
No one ever actually said I had
to stay on the path, did they?

00:06:32.552 --> 00:06:35.123
<i>[Goku] I should've done this
from the start!</i>

00:06:35.223 --> 00:06:37.193
Yow-ow-ow-ow!

00:07:05.016 --> 00:07:06.654
That was too close
for comfort..

00:07:06.754 --> 00:07:08.790
Maybe running isn't
so bad after all...

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:16.740
[dinosaur stomping]

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.754
[frightened yelling]

00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:34.776
Help me!.. Please!..
Ah! Somebody help!

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.263
[wind blowing]

00:08:11.248 --> 00:08:17.060
Now I'm stuck...! Help...
Somebody...?! I can't get down!

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:25.944
Oh man!.. I don't know what
that guide was talking about!

00:08:26.044 --> 00:08:28.349
He said since I was up here,
I wouldn't have to worry

00:08:28.449 --> 00:08:31.255
about food, but--I'm starving!

00:08:34.596 --> 00:08:36.600
<i>[Roshi] What? You didn't tell
her?!</i>

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.837
I'm sorry. I just couldn't.

00:08:38.937 --> 00:08:41.677
I was gonna, but, you
know, it just.. oh...

00:08:41.777 --> 00:08:43.881
You mean... none of it?

00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:44.849
Right...

00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:46.853
You're hopeless,
you know that?..

00:08:46.953 --> 00:08:49.091
All you had to do was blurt
it out, it's not hard.

00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:51.696
Heh.. Sure, it's easy
for you to say...

00:08:51.796 --> 00:08:53.533
Try lookin' Chichi
in the face...

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.838
then you tell her Goku's
dead. It's impossible!

00:08:55.938 --> 00:08:58.678
Well.. can't say I blame ya.

00:08:58.778 --> 00:09:00.715
But we can't.. not tell her...

00:09:00.815 --> 00:09:03.620
Yeah, yeah, I know..
So how about this--..

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.123
we'll write a letter
to Chichi instead!

00:09:05.223 --> 00:09:08.396
You mean I'm off the hook?..
That's a great idea!

00:09:08.496 --> 00:09:10.634
Okay, so what about
the Dragon Balls?..

00:09:10.734 --> 00:09:12.171
The two at Goku's place?..

00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:15.176
Tell me you still managed
to pick them up, at least.

00:09:15.276 --> 00:09:18.049
um.. I forgot.

00:09:18.149 --> 00:09:19.786
Totally hopeless.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.664
[crying]

00:09:29.137 --> 00:09:35.149
I'm hungry.. and cold...
and tired.. and scared...

00:09:44.502 --> 00:09:49.712
Wow, apples.. Guess they
must've fallen here.. I'm saved!

00:09:56.358 --> 00:09:58.162
Oh well...

00:10:05.009 --> 00:10:11.021
These things.. are sour...Ugh,
that's gross...

00:10:13.059 --> 00:10:17.602
I miss my Mom's cooking..
I wanna eat a real dinner!

00:10:17.702 --> 00:10:20.908
Oh, come on! He's lucky
he even got that.

00:10:36.873 --> 00:10:38.276
<i>[Piccolo] I hope you enjoyed it,
kid.</i>

00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:41.182
<i>That's the one and only time
I intend to help you...</i>

00:10:41.282 --> 00:10:43.954
<i>If you can't survive on
your own after this,</i>

00:10:44.054 --> 00:10:46.092
<i>then it means I was
wrong about you...</i>

00:10:46.192 --> 00:10:48.763
<i>And you're just a
normal little brat.</i>

00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:07.768
Ahh!.. That's bright!

00:11:22.064 --> 00:11:25.604
What am I gonna do?.. I'm
stuck up here!.. oh,

00:11:25.704 --> 00:11:30.079
I'm never gonna get down.. and
I'm still starving!.. waaah!

00:11:30.179 --> 00:11:32.619
Believe me. When his stomach
rumbles loud enough,

00:11:32.719 --> 00:11:34.922
he's gonna find a way down.

00:11:37.995 --> 00:11:42.003
He kept Gohan out all night and
didn't even bother calling once!

00:11:42.104 --> 00:11:44.943
Uh... it's been so long since
he's seen all of his friends..

00:11:45.043 --> 00:11:46.813
He probably just lost
track of time, you know..

00:11:46.913 --> 00:11:49.251
then, decided to spend the
night with Master Roshi.

00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:51.188
Well, that's still just
poor parenting!..

00:11:51.288 --> 00:11:53.894
Gohan has his schoolwork
to think about!

00:11:53.994 --> 00:11:56.899
Come on, missing one day's
not that big of a deal, is it?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.906
Yeah? But where does it stop?!
First it's just a single day..

00:12:00.006 --> 00:12:02.177
then the next thing you know,
my son's a homeless bum!

00:12:02.277 --> 00:12:06.051
Ahh... Chichi!

00:12:08.957 --> 00:12:11.863
[Bulma] There, that should do
it...

00:12:11.963 --> 00:12:14.936
Hey, guys!.. Hop to!
I think I got it working!

00:12:21.381 --> 00:12:22.718
[yelling]

00:12:23.186 --> 00:12:24.689
Listen! I have been
up all night,

00:12:24.789 --> 00:12:26.258
and I am a little bit
irritable right now!

00:12:26.358 --> 00:12:28.931
You do not want to get on
my bad side this morning!

00:12:29.031 --> 00:12:33.807
Now, then.. let's try this
again.. "Hop to, guys!"

00:12:33.907 --> 00:12:36.411
Uhh . . hop where?

00:12:36.512 --> 00:12:40.420
Come on.. stand up so I can put
this baby through its paces.

00:12:40.521 --> 00:12:42.190
<i>[Bulma] I changed the characters
in the display</i>

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.964
<i>to make it easier to read..
ah! One-thirty-nine!</i>

00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:49.237
One-thirty--?.. Oh, no, Bulma,
I'm much older than that.

00:12:49.337 --> 00:12:51.041
It's not your age,
it's your strength.

00:12:51.141 --> 00:12:53.046
Your "power level" or whatever.

00:12:53.146 --> 00:12:55.149
It can tell you that just
by lookin' at me?..

00:12:55.249 --> 00:12:57.220
wow.. That's an
amazing device...

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.093
One-Thirty-Nine, that
sounds tough to beat!

00:13:00.193 --> 00:13:02.931
Okay, okay, c'mon, my turn!
What's my number, Bulma?

00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:10.079
<i>[Bulma] How 'bout that?

Wha--.. Hold on!..
You sure you fixed it?!

00:13:17.426 --> 00:13:19.230
Not to brag, but I am sort
of a whiz at this stuff.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.939
<i>[Yajirobe] He-y-y-y-y-y! Hey!</i>

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:26.078
Yeah, "hey" yourself.. Who is
that? You ever heard'a knockin'?

00:13:26.178 --> 00:13:27.046
Shut up.

00:13:27.146 --> 00:13:30.053
Huh... Oh yeah, I remember you.

00:13:30.153 --> 00:13:32.525
You're, um, eh..uh..
What's your name again?

00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:34.161
It's Yajirobe! You know that!

00:13:34.261 --> 00:13:35.998
Now quit askin'
stupid questions!

00:13:36.098 --> 00:13:38.135
Listen--Korin told
me to tell you

00:13:38.235 --> 00:13:40.608
to come to the tower
for special training.

00:13:40.708 --> 00:13:42.477
Wait, as in the Korin?

00:13:43.814 --> 00:13:46.184
"Hey, look at me. I'm
know-it-all Korin"

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:48.489
That's the guy. And he wants
you to bring Yamcha..

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:52.064
and Ten-somebody, and
uh.. Chow-whatever.

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:54.702
Oh... You mean Tien
and Chiaotzu, right?

00:13:54.802 --> 00:13:56.205
Not me...?

00:13:56.305 --> 00:13:59.613
Did I say you? Just get over
to Korin Tower and stuff...

00:13:59.713 --> 00:14:01.281
I'm training with you, too.

00:14:01.381 --> 00:14:02.952
What? Really?

00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:04.588
Yeah.. Crazy, huh?..

00:14:04.689 --> 00:14:07.828
I told Korin "there's no way I'm
fightin' any stupid aliens",

00:14:07.928 --> 00:14:09.198
and he went through the roof!

00:14:09.298 --> 00:14:13.172
I thought he was gonna
kill me.. He's serious.

00:14:13.272 --> 00:14:17.013
Wow! It, uh.. sounds like
we don't have a choice.

00:14:17.113 --> 00:14:18.884
You don't.. or at
least I didn't...

00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:21.088
But I don't care. Do
whatever you want!

00:14:21.188 --> 00:14:24.762
Oh..wait.. I almost
forgot. Don't wish Goku

00:14:24.862 --> 00:14:26.232
back to life with
the Dragon Balls

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:28.302
until the Saiyans arrive
one year from now!

00:14:28.402 --> 00:14:29.872
What?.. Bu- But why?

00:14:29.972 --> 00:14:31.509
Beats me..

00:14:31.609 --> 00:14:33.046
Somethin' about "special
training in the Other World"

00:14:33.146 --> 00:14:34.448
or somethin' like that.

00:14:34.549 --> 00:14:36.653
Some lady named Baba's
supposed to come by later

00:14:36.753 --> 00:14:39.592
to tell you the rest..
so just ask her.

00:14:39.692 --> 00:14:40.928
Later losers!

00:14:41.028 --> 00:14:44.033
Wait!.. My sister?...
She's coming?!

00:14:46.171 --> 00:14:48.375
So.. what's Goku doing again?

00:14:48.475 --> 00:14:51.314
No idea...

00:14:51.414 --> 00:14:55.389
Hey, uh... I think he
might be coming back.

00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:02.137
Hel-lo there! Master Roshi!

00:15:02.237 --> 00:15:05.176
It's good to see you!
Hello everybody!

00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:07.380
It's Ox King! And
he's with Chichi!!

00:15:11.288 --> 00:15:16.031
This is bad, right?..
What do we do? Roshi?

00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:19.103
Well.. I guess it's too late
to write that letter...

00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:24.414
[Ox King] Master Roshi! It's
been far too long! (ha ha)

00:15:24.515 --> 00:15:25.584
How are you teacher?

00:15:25.684 --> 00:15:27.120
I hope the years are
treating you well? (ha ha)

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.259
Uh.. So far so good...Years...

00:15:30.359 --> 00:15:32.297
Alright, where are they!..

00:15:32.397 --> 00:15:36.038
I know they're here
somewhere! Start talking!

00:15:36.138 --> 00:15:39.277
Well uh... They're a...
it's like this...

00:15:39.377 --> 00:15:40.781
Huh?

You're saying Goku had to--"
I mean--" That he's, uh--!

00:15:51.235 --> 00:15:53.438
He's... in other world.

[wind blowing]

00:16:23.432 --> 00:16:26.171
This is stupid. I don't even
know how I got up here...

00:16:28.308 --> 00:16:31.181
Hm?

00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:34.287
Why do I still have a shadow
when it's night time?

00:16:35.624 --> 00:16:39.197
Wow...! That's the
biggest moon ever!...

00:16:39.297 --> 00:16:42.805
It's so bright! It
must be a full moon!

00:16:42.905 --> 00:16:45.710
I've never seen one
of those before...

00:16:47.113 --> 00:16:49.317
[magic laser beam]

00:16:52.057 --> 00:16:54.427
Huh?! What the--?

00:16:57.133 --> 00:16:59.337
[heart pounding]

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:24.521

[Piccolo] If he keeps this up,
the Earth will be destroyed

00:18:16.225 --> 00:18:18.596
before the Saiyans
even get here...!

00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:21.669
But, how do I stop him...?!

00:18:25.209 --> 00:18:27.446
<i>[Raditz] Don't play
dumb!.. You must know!</i>

00:18:27.547 --> 00:18:29.451
<i>You've lived on this
planet your entire life!</i>

00:18:29.552 --> 00:18:31.222
<i>The full moon is
key to unlocking</i>

00:18:31.322 --> 00:18:33.259
<i>a Saiyan's true potential!</i>

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:37.366
<i>[Piccolo] That's it! The full
moon... They need the moon!</i>

00:18:48.389 --> 00:18:50.593
[huge moon explosion]

00:18:57.575 --> 00:18:59.578
[roar]

00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:24.328
So that's the secret of
the Saiyans' power...

00:19:24.428 --> 00:19:26.966
It's that tail of theirs...

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:29.037
Somehow it gives
them the ability

00:19:29.137 --> 00:19:31.174
to transform at a full moon.

00:19:31.274 --> 00:19:32.778
If that's the case,

00:19:32.878 --> 00:19:35.482
it's probably for the best
that I destroyed it...

00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:39.191
<i>If a boy did this much damage,</i>

00:19:39.291 --> 00:19:40.627
<i>I hate to think what
the other two Saiyans</i>

00:19:40.727 --> 00:19:44.000
<i>would have done when
they arrived...</i>

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.541
But now, without the moon, they
won't be able to transform.

00:19:47.641 --> 00:19:50.345
And we'll be on a more
level playing field.

00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:52.885
In fact, we have an
advantage now...

00:19:52.985 --> 00:19:55.422
because we know that their
tails are a weak point.

00:19:55.523 --> 00:20:00.533
Which means right now, the kid's
tail is only a liability.

00:20:02.604 --> 00:20:07.514
There. Now you need some new
clothes. Maybe a sword.

00:20:07.614 --> 00:20:10.352
I suppose I could at least
provide you with that much.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.404
The clothes are
like your fathers.

00:20:19.505 --> 00:20:21.441
But the symbol shows
you're from my camp.

00:20:21.543 --> 00:20:24.649
That's it. I've already done
more for you than I intended.

00:20:24.749 --> 00:20:27.086
I don't have time to
baby-sit you any longer.

00:20:27.186 --> 00:20:29.023
I have my own training to do.

00:20:29.124 --> 00:20:32.130
If you can survive out here
for six months on your own,

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.535
you'll see me again...
And then you'll see

00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:36.706
what you're made of when
your real training begins.

00:20:36.806 --> 00:20:40.581
And when you learn what I
have in store for you...

00:20:40.681 --> 00:20:44.420
I promise... you're not going
to be happy to see me.
