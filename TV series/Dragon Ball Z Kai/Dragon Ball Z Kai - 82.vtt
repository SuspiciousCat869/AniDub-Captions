flexing of muscles...

00:14:56.726 --> 00:14:59.565

a transformation like that...

[CELL BELLOWS AS HE POWERS UP]

It makes for an impressive
display, certainly,

00:15:28.624 --> 00:15:31.428
but if your opponent has
any kind of speed...?

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.604
Worthless...

00:15:35.638 --> 00:15:37.207
[CELL] Honestly, I d have
thought anyone calling himself

understand that much.

I ve been so blind...

But... he didn t use it...

00:15:54.307 --> 00:15:57.113
He knew that...
this is what would happen...

00:15:58.115 --> 00:15:59.451
[TRUNKS THINKS]
What was I thinking?

00:15:59.484 --> 00:16:02.390
How could I
be such a fool...?

00:16:04.996 --> 00:16:08.603

in fighting anymore

But how...?

00:16:31.516 --> 00:16:34.487
I was sure he had this one...

Well there s

the next he s
rarin to go again...

00:16:53.392 --> 00:16:55.564
It s enough to
wear a guy out...

00:17:10.326 --> 00:17:11.295
Say, guys...

00:17:11.328 --> 00:17:13.967
so what s the latest
on Trunks and Cell?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.504
He s incredible...

00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:17.775
Naturally... That s my boy!

No... Not Trunks...

disappointed I am in

both you and Vegeta.

00:17:33.907 --> 00:17:37.915
I expected far more from
a pair of Super Saiyans.

00:17:37.948 --> 00:17:40.219
Though I do
have one question...

00:17:40.253 --> 00:17:42.525
While it ultimately
came up lacking...

00:17:42.558 --> 00:17:44.361
you and Vegeta still
managed to increase

00:17:44.394 --> 00:17:48.402
your power considerably
in a short period of time.

00:17:48.435 --> 00:17:50.941
Tell me... how did you do it?

00:17:54.114 --> 00:17:56.018
[CELL] You don t
want to answer?

00:17:56.051 --> 00:17:58.055
Alright then. Let me
change the question.

00:17:58.089 --> 00:18:01.996
[CELL] If you had more time,
could you get even stronger?

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.332
Could you?

00:18:03.365 --> 00:18:06.371
Maybe... I don t know,
what difference does it make?!

00:18:07.775 --> 00:18:11.549
And, why would you even
ask something like that?

00:18:12.551 --> 00:18:15.256
Just exploring a
few possibilities...

00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:16.926
Now one more question...

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.097
Why hasn t Goku made
an appearance...?

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:21.134
You must know
where he s been hiding...

00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:22.137
He s not hiding!

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.008
He s training to
defeat you as we speak...!

00:18:25.042 --> 00:18:27.079
And knowing him,
when he comes out...

00:18:27.113 --> 00:18:29.785

than dad or I ever were...

you down, it s him!

then come and face me again.

some kinda sick joke?

I m not sure whether
or not you re aware...

00:18:54.535 --> 00:18:56.238

there was an event

00:18:56.271 --> 00:18:57.641
held every few years
known as the

00:18:57.675 --> 00:18:59.645
World Martial
Arts Tournament.

to recreate that.

00:19:01.582 --> 00:19:03.820

difference is that it will be me

00:19:03.853 --> 00:19:05.423
versus all of you.

and after each time I win,

the next challenger
will be free to step on in.

Obviously, the more
challengers you bring...

00:19:14.842 --> 00:19:17.146
the better your chances
are of winning...!

00:19:18.148 --> 00:19:21.455
Though better is
entirely relative in this case.

00:19:21.488 --> 00:19:22.691

once I ve decided

00:19:22.724 --> 00:19:24.595
upon a
suitable location...

Otherwise it
doesn t make sense!

[CELL] Must you always
be so suspicious?

00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:53.920
[CELL] I will hold
the tournament

00:19:53.953 --> 00:19:56.893
simply to showcase
the power of my perfect form.

00:19:56.926 --> 00:19:58.830
[CELL] And I also hope to
draw out a challenger

who can actually
test my limits.

00:20:03.038 --> 00:20:05.945
I have no particular
objective beyond that...

in such vulgar pursuits

Even the purpose for
which I was originally created,

00:20:12.525 --> 00:20:14.629
the defeat of
Goku for Dr. Gero...

00:20:14.662 --> 00:20:17.734
at this point,
it just seems trivial.

my only goal now

00:20:21.676 --> 00:20:23.913
