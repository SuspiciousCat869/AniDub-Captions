00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.811
[CELL]
With who, you?!

00:21:45.844 --> 00:21:48.516
You couldn't even
beat Android Eighteen!

00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:51.221
[VEGETA] Don't you worry,
she'll be next on my list.

00:21:51.254 --> 00:21:52.625
She's going to learn that

00:21:52.658 --> 00:21:55.329
no one makes a fool of Vegeta
and gets away with it!

00:21:55.362 --> 00:22:02.210
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai...

00:22:02.243 --> 00:22:03.847
[VEGETA]
I am second to no one!

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.050
Do you hear me?! No one!
