1
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,250
- UGH. COME ON, FERRIS.

2
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,666
WHAT IN THE WORLD COULD
BE TAKING YOU SO LONG?

3
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,666
AT LEAST THE LITTLE
GUY'S STILL ASLEEP.

4
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,916
- THAT BOY IS OUR
RESEARCH SUBJECT!

5
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,875
TAKE HIM AND YOU'LL BE
CONDEMNED AS HIS ACCOMPLICE

6
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,833
AND STRUCK DOWN BY
THE WRATH OF HEAVEN!

7
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,791
- RAT BASTARDS...

8
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,958
GO ON, KID...
NAP AS MUCH AS YOU WANT...

9
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,833
SURE BEATS DEALING WITH
THE REAL WORLD. MOSTLY.

10
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,375
- Ferris: STAND ASIDE!

11
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,583
- ( groans )

12
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,791
DAMN IT! WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ONE FOR?

13
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,708
- DON'T PLAY INNOCENT...

14
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,041
YOU WERE FILLING THE POOR
BOY'S HEAD WITH WICKED IDEAS

15
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:01,958
THROUGH OSMOSIS.

16
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,458
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

17
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,583
- SO, DARE I ASK
YOUR STRATEGY?

18
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,708
- MY STRATEGY?
- FOR RAISING THE CHILD...

19
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,833
CLEARLY THE FRUIT OF SOME
LONG FORGOTTEN TRYST

20
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,333
YOU THOUGHT YOU
LEFT TO ROT YEARS AGO

21
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,541
HAS COME BACK TO CLAIM HIS
RIGHT AS YOUR OFFSPRING.

22
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,625
- BY NO STRETCH OF
THE IMAGINATION IS HE MINE!

23
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,041
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE I'M
THE ONLY ONE BEING PURSUED...

24
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,958
THE LONGER YOU STAND
AROUND CRACKING JOKE...

25
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,000
- BEHIND YOU.

26
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,958
- UH...

27
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,916
- FORTUNE LED ME TO THIS
EXQUISITE ABANDONED CARRIAGE...

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,875
- CARE FOR A LIFT?
- ABANDONED?

29
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,500
OH, YEAH. SURE...
I'LL BELIEVE THAT STORY...

30
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,125
ABANDONED BY THE NOBLES
YOU FORCIBLY PINCHED IT FROM!

31
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,708
- OH, BE QUIET...
JUST HURRY AND CLIMB ON...

32
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,166
BEFORE YOUR PERVERSION STARTS
TO RUB OFF ON THE LAD.

33
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,291
- KNOCK IT OFF!

34
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,791
MIGHT AS WELL, I SUPPOSE...

35
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,208
CAN'T HAUL THE KID LIKE A RUSSET
SACK ALL THE WAY TO REGIT.

36
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,208
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I'M PLEASANTLY SURPRISED.

37
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,958
IT ISN'T LIKE YOU
TO BE SO THOUGHTFUL.

38
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,625
- HI-HO, SILVER!

39
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,375
- ( neighing )

40
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,541
- EASE UP ON THE WHIP!

41
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,416
I'M NOT IN THE STUPID
CARRIAGE YET!

42
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,333
- FULL GALLOP, BOY!

43
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,166
FLEE FROM THE LASCIVIOUS
BEAST AT OUR BACKS

44
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,916
LIKE A FOX FROM A HOUND!

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,250
- COME ON!
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS!

46
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,916
HEY! I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME!

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,750
- SORRY, I DIDN'T QUITE CATCH
THAT. YOU'RE TOO FAR BEHIND.

48
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,500
- OH, YOU ARE SO GOING TO GET IT
WHEN I CATCH UP WITH THAT RIG!

49
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,916
DAMN IT, FERRIS!

50
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,291
- ( knock on door )

51
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,125
- Sion: COME IN.

52
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,958
- YOUR LUNCH IS SERVED,
YOUR MAJESTY.

53
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,458
- THANK YOU.
JUST SET IT THERE, PLEASE.

54
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,458
- MAY I SUGGEST YOU TAKE A
MOMENT FROM YOUR WORK

55
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,791
TO EAT BEFORE THE
MEAL GETS COLD?

56
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,666
- I'LL EAT THE SECOND I'M DONE
WITH THIS MOUNTAIN OF PAPERWORK.

57
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,083
- PLEASE, SIR,
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

58
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,875
- AH, SEE, HERE'S A PERFECT
EXAMPLE OF THE MISSIVES

59
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,625
I RECEIVE FROM DAY TO DAY.

60
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,875
- THANKS FOR SADDLING ME

61
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,708
WITH THIS RIDICULOUS
FIELD MARSHAL POSITION...

62
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,375
I'M ON TO YOU...
SADISTIC BASTARD!

63
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,041
YOU EXPECT ME TO DIE OF BOREDOM!

64
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,666
- ( giggling )

65
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,416
- THIS REPRESENTS THE BACKLOG OF
REPORTS SUBMITTED BY THOSE

66
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,250
APPOINTED TO CABINET POSITIONS
DURING MY TENURE AS KING.

67
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,666
- EVERY ONE OF THEM CHOSEN
FROM THE LOWER CLASS.

68
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,041
- WELL I REALLY DIDN'T INTEND
TO SHIRK THE NOBILITY

69
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,208
WHEN ASSIGNING POSTS.

70
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,041
IT JUST SEEMED TO
WORK OUT THAT WAY

71
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,375
WHEN I DECIDED TO FAVOR
PERSONAL MERITS

72
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,666
OVER THE ACCIDENT
OF ONE'S BIRTH.

73
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,291
SO FAR, EVERY PERSON SELECTED
HAS DRAFTED A PROPOSAL

74
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,833
WITH THE GREATER
GOOD IN MIND...

75
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,791
WHICH WAS THE IDEA.

76
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,875
YOU SEE, ESLINA,
NEW BEGINNINGS THRIVE

77
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,625
ON OUR THINKING
FROM THE GROUND UP.

78
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,208
- I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

79
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,625
JUST AS LOFTY PRINCIPLES THRIVE
ON A WELL-FED IMAGINATION, SIR.

80
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,500
AND KINGS ON A HARDY LUNCH.

81
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,666
- SO THEY DO.

82
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,708
- I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT,
YOUR MAJESTY.

83
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,166
- NEW BEGINNINGS AND
LOFTY IDEALS...

84
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,833
WELL, IN THIS QUIET
THEY SEEM TO THRIVE AT LEAST.

85
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,541
THE STORM WILL BREAK
BEFORE LONG...

86
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,000
- ( knocking on door )

87
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,125
- COME IN.

88
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,708
TROUBLESOME NEWS?

89
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,500

THAT THE NOBLES OF ARKMEL

90
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,916
ARE CLAMORING FOR YOUR
REMOVAL FROM THE THRONE.

91
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,041
- YOU DON'T SAY.

92
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,750
- IN THE REGION OF
HOUSE FROAUDE.

93
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,416
- HOW INTERESTING... I SHOULD
HAVE ANTICIPATED AS MUCH.

94
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,125
- ( chattering )

95
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:42,958
- Miran: FATHER.

96
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,416
- YES? WHAT IS IT?

97
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,500
- THE GUESTS HAVE GATHERED
IN THE RECEPTION HALL.

98
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,000
- AH. GOOD.

99
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,291
- IF I MAY, SIR.
IT IS A REMARKABLE FEAT.

100
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,583
AT YOUR BEHEST, NOBLES FROM
EVERY CORNER OF THE REGION

101
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,625
HAVE GATHERED UNDER ONE ROOF.

102
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,041
- COME, MY BOY...

103
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,625
THE ACCOMPLISHMENT
BELONGS MORE

104
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,500
ON YOUR HEAD THAN
IT DOES ON MINE.

105
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,041
- NOT SO, FATHER.

106
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,375
I MERELY MAKE A STUDY WHERE
YOU ARE THE CONSUMMATE MASTER.

107
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,208
- SUCH SILKEN WORDS YOU WEAVE...

108
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,750
YOU ARE YOUR FATHER'S PRIDE JUST
AS MUCH AS YOU ARE HIS WEAKNESS.

109
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,625
EVER WISE. EVER BEAUTIFUL...

110
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:24,541
MIRAN. MY LOVELY, MIRAN...

111
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,958
- YOUR OWN SWEET WORDS WEAVE
A THREAD TO EQUAL YOUR CARESSES.

112
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,041
YOUR PRIDE IS MY WEAKNESS, SIR.

113
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,625
- ( laughs )

114
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:37,666
- BUT LET THE TWO OF US NOT...
BECOME ENTANGLED JUST YET...

115
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,375
WE HAVE GUESTS TO SEE TO,
AFTER ALL.

116
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,791
- ( chattering )

117
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,500
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE.

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,666
BUT MY THANKS, MOST OF ALL...
TO YOUR AUGUST EARS...

119
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,958
LET US FIRST GIVE CREDIT
TO WHERE IT IS DUE...

120
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:58,416
THE BANQUET'S ORGANIZERS,
DUKE STEARIED, THERE AMONG YOU,

121
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,541
AND OF COURSE YOUR HOST,
THE ILLUSTRIOUS KARLAL FROAUDE.

122
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,250
- ( crowd cheering )

123
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,500
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT
SUCH EXCELLENT PEOPLE

124
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,750
WOULD SEE FIT TO ENDURE

125
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:13,208
THE WHIMS OF AN OLD MAN
IS SPLENDIDLY MOVING.

126
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:18,625
NO DOUBT, SHREWD AS YOU ALL ARE,
OUR PURPOSE HERE TODAY IS PLAIN.

127
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,625
IF I SPEAK TRUE, BY ALL MEANS

128
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,000
LET ME HEAR YOUR
BRAVE VOICES GIVE ASSENT.

129
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,291
- Man 1: WE'RE HERE TO PUT
A CALLOW, UPSTART KING

130
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,125
IN HIS WELL DESERVED GRAVE!

131
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,333
- Man 2: HIS BLOOD MUST BE SHED
FOR FLOUTING OUR GOOD NAMES!

132
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,125
- Man 3: HIS POPULIST IDEALS
WILL BE THE END OF US!

133
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,625
- Karkan: JUST SO, MY FRIENDS.
THE TIME FOR HIS REIGN TO END

134
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,000
IS UPON US!

135
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,041
ROYAL BLOOD OR NOT,
ASTAL IS A LOWBORN MONGREL...

136
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,583
THE LONGER WE LET HIM SPIT
AT US FROM ON HIGH,

137
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,291
THE MORE CERTAIN IS OUR DOOM!

138
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,250
HE MUST BE CRUSHED!
MADE AN EXAMPLE OF!

139
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,416
THE MEANS TO DO
SO ARE WELL IN HAND...

140
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,791
THE EMPIRE OF RUNA HAS
ALIGNED ITSELF TO US

141
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:54,958
IN THIS SENTIMENT...

142
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,083
THEY TOO WOULD SEE
AN END TO THE BASTARD...

143
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,791
ALLOW MY SON MIRAN
TO DESCRIBE THE PLAN

144
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,541
THIS ALLIANCE HAS WROUGHT.

145
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,750
WHY DO YOU HESITATE?

146
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,666
- BEFORE THE REALM CAN PROSPER,

147
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,166
I MUST FIRST ASK THAT ALL OF YOU
PRESENT HERE THIS AFTERNOON...

148
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,208
DIE.

149
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,500
- Man 1: WHAT'S
THE MEANING OF THIS?

150
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,375
- BOY, THIS IS NOT
THE TIME FOR ANTICS!

151
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,291
- DARKNESS, DESTROY.

152
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,458
- ( people screaming )

153
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,958
- NO!

154
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,541
WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME
HAVE YOU DONE?

155
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,833
DEAR GOD!
NO! SHOW ME MERCY!

156
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,000
- OH, BUT I'VE AWAITED
THIS DAY LONGER

157
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,625
THAN YOU CAN
POSSIBLY IMAGINE...

158
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,791
EVER SINCE, IN FACT,
I WAS FIRST PRESENTED TO YOU.

159
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,166
YOU SEE, AN AMBITION HAS
BURNED IN MY BREAST

160
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,708
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

161
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,625
AN AMBITION TO WHICH YOU,
DEAR FATHER,

162
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,750
HAVE BEEN LITTLE
MORE THAN A PAWN.

163
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,875
- BUT, MIRAN, YOU WERE
ONLY FIVE YEARS OLD

164
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,791
WHEN FIRST PRESENTED
TO ME FOR ADOPTION...

165
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,500
- QUITE SO, AND IN THOSE DAYS
YOUR ELDER BROTHER

166
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,250
WAS THE PATRIARCH
OF THIS HOUSE...

167
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,958
UNTIL, THAT IS, HE AND HIS
IMMEDIATE SUCCESSORS ALL MET

168
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,708
WITH UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENTS
ONE AFTER THE OTHER.

169
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,750
SUCH A PITY THAT WAS.

170
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,250
BUT SOON THEREAFTER,

171
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,000
ALL OF HOUSE FROAUDE
WAS YOURS, WAS IT NOT?

172
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,083
- YOU MEAN...
YOU MASSACRED THE CLAN?

173
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,583
MY WHOLE FAMILY? EVERY LAST ONE.

174
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:53,708
- COME NOW, SIR...

175
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,333
THAT'S HARDLY TRUE
SO LONG AS YOU LIVE.

176
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,708
- PLEASE, MY SON!
I BEG YOU. DON'T!

177
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:03,458
- HEARING YOU BEG IS A PLEASURE
THAT QUICKLY WEARS ITSELF THIN.

178
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,583
A FOND FAREWELL...
LORD KARKAL.

179
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,000
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS!
YOU CAN'T...

180
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,416
( screams )

181
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,000
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR
COOPERATION.

182
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,916
IT IS MUCH APPRECIATED...

183
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,458
THUS YOU SEE
MY PREFERRED METHOD

184
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,833
FOR DEALING WITH
POLITICAL DISSENT.

185
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:29,250
RECALL THIS SCENE SHOULD THE
URGE EVER TAKE YOU TO BETRAY ME.

186
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,500
- Stearied: MAKE NO MISTAKE,
I SHALL...

187
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,916
AFTER WITNESSING THIS...

188
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,541
A MAN WOULD HAVE TO BE A FOOL
TO TRY AND CHALLENGE...

189
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,833
( gasps )

190
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,708
- WHAT IN THE...

191
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,166
( Miran laughs )

192
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,291
YOU MANAGED TO ESCAPE
MY SHADOWS, I SEE...

193
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,583
WHO DO I HAVE THE PLEASURE
OF ADDRESSING?

194
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,458
- Lir: THE FACT THAT I'M HERE
MUST MEAN I'M A MEMBER

195
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,000
OF ROLAND'S NOBILITY...

196
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,291
- Miran: YES, VERY DROLL.
YOUR HAIR IS TELLING, THOUGH.

197
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,333
THE SOUTHERN REGIONS AREN'T
KNOWN FOR CROWNING NATIVES

198
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,916
WITH PEACH-COLORED LOCKS.

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,125
- NICELY DONE...

200
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,500
YOU'RE A MAN WHO PAYS
ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

201
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,333
- FROM WHAT COUNTRY
DO YOU CRAWL?

202
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,250
- DO I LOOK LIKE THE SORT OF
CHUMP WHO'D ANSWER THAT?

203
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,916
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
YOU DO NOT.

204
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,625
- I'D LOVE TO TRADE QUIPS,
BUT I HAVE A JOB TO DO...

205
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,833
'COURSE I WAS HOPING NOT TO
HAVE TO USE MY FULL POWER

206
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:28,958
IN THESE DIGS...

207
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,958
BUT I GUESS YOU DO
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

208
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,916
- DARKEST NIGHT...
- BEASTS BORN OF HORIZON'S FIRE.

209
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,083
- COME FORTH!
- COME FORTH!

210
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:46,166
- JUST AS I SUSPECTED. YOU CARRY
A WEAPON SIMILAR TO MINE.

211
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,083
- FUNNY. MOST FOLKS REACT TO MY
FRIENDS HERE A LITTLE MORE,

212
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,666
UH, ENTHUSIASTICALLY.

213
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,875
YOU MIGHT BE THE ONLY PERSON
WHOSE FIRST INSTINCT

214
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,541
ISN'T TO TURN TAIL AND RUN.

215
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,208
- Miran: OH, MAKE NO MISTAKE.
I AM FASCINATED.

216
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,500
YOUR VERY EXISTENCE
RAISES QUESTIONS.

217
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:03,208
SUCH AS WHY YOU WOULD
TROUBLE WITH DUKE STEARIED.

218
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:06,000
CLEARY HE WAS A VITAL PIECE
IN SEVERAL GAMES AT ONCE.

219
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,000
GAMES FOR HIGH STAKES...

220
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,625
PRESUMABLY AT LEAST ONE
OF WHICH IS BEING PLAYED

221
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,208
BY A FELLOW
COUNTRYMAN OF YOURS

222
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,041
WHOSE SIGHTS ARE SET ON ROLAND.

223
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,000
- Lir:
OH, I SHOULD'VE DUCKED OUT

224
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,958
BEFORE YOU PIECED THAT TOGETHER.

225
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,875
BUT, YOU SEE... YOUR LITTLE
TRINKET CATCHES MY EYE.

226
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,125
- WHAT I SEEK IS
THE BURNING FIELDS!

227
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,625
- LIGHTING BEASTS, ATTACK!

228
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,083
I'D SAY WE'RE EVENLY MATCHED...

229
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,416
NOT MUCH POINT IN
US CARRYING ON LIKE THIS...

230
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,166
- I'M SORRY... I'M AFRAID
THAT'S NOT QUITE THE CASE...

231
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,041
SEEMS YOU'VE A BIT OF A
DILEMMA ON YOUR HANDS.

232
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,166
ALL ELSE BEING EQUAL,

233
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,541
IT IS I WHO HOLD
THE ADVANTAGE HERE...

234
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,500
YOU CANNOT RECITE A PROPER
INVOCATION WITHIN EARSHOT OF ME

235
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,666
FOR FEAR OF EXPOSING
YOUR PLACE OF ORIGIN...

236
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,000
BESIDES WHICH...

237
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,625
- YOU REALLY LIKE TO TALK.

238
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,625
- EVERY DOOR AND WINDOW IN THIS
HALL HAS BEEN SEALED SHUT...

239
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,166
YOUR ONLY HOPE OF GETTING OUT

240
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,708
WOULD BE TO SET YOUR LIGHTNING
BEASTS TO WORK ON AN EXIT...

241
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,583
DURING WHICH INTERVAL
MY SHADOW BEASTS

242
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,708
WILL HAPPILY RIP OUT
YOUR INSIDES.

243
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,666
NOT A STRATEGIC POSITION
TO BE ENVIED, I SHOULD SAY.

244
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,208
- WOW, MAN...
BET EVERYONE LOVES YOU, HUH?

245
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,500
- SHOULD I FEEL INSULTED?
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

246
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:16,625
SURRENDER, OR RISK CERTAIN DEATH
FOR THE NARROW CHANCE OF ESCAPE?

247
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,041
- THINK I'LL PASS ON BOTH
THOSE OPTIONS...

248
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,333
I'M A GUY THAT LIKES
TO MAKE HIS OWN WAY.

249
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,916
A LINO DOUE CRYSTAL...

250
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,208
WITH THIS THING...
I WIN!

251
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,750
- OH DEAR...

252
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,625
DIRECTING MY SHADOW
BEASTS AT THE DOOR

253
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,875
WEAKENS MY DECOY PROJECTION...

254
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,458
I MISJUDGED YOU...

255
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,416
TO THINK THAT I WOULD
MEET MY END HERE,

256
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,708
IN THIS HOVEL.

257
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,416
- Claugh: GET DOWN!

258
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,333
- FIELD MARSHAL CLAUGH?
- ON YOUR FEET!

259
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,791
- WHY ON EARTH
ARE YOU EVEN HERE?

260
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,541
- SAVE THE TALKING FOR LATER.

261
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,500
- LET THERE BE DARKNESS!

262
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,833
WHAT'S THE PLAN
FOR GETTING OUT OF HERE?

263
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:44,000
MY SHADOW BEASTS WILL ONLY
SHIELD US FOR SO LONG.

264
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,125
- I'VE GOT THIS.

265
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,541
( grunts )

266
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,125
- DOES THIS PUT US ON
GOOD TERMS?

267
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,375
FORGIVE ME...

268
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,541
NOT TO SOUND UNGRATEFUL,
BUT WHY ARE YOU HERE?

269
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,583
- LOOK, DON'T GET ANY IDEAS.
IT'S NOT LIKE I WANTED TO COME.

270
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,458
I WAS JUST ACTING
ON ORDERS FROM SION.

271
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,625
- ACTING ON ORDERS?
BUT WHY NOT THEN ARRIVE

272
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,416
WITH A FULL COMPLIMENT
OF SOLDIERS?

273
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,333
- I BROUGHT A HANDFUL
OF INFANTRYMEN...

274
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,458
SION WOULDN'T HAVE IT OTHERWISE.

275
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,625
HE SAID I'D PROBABLY
MEET RESISTANCE,

276
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,416
SO COMING ALONE
WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION...

277
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,125
BUT, I...

278
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,583
WELL I KINDA RAN OUT
AHEAD OF THEM A BIT, SEE...

279
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,333
ONLY SO I COULD HAVE THE
PLEASURE OF PUNCHING YOU

280
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,666
WITHOUT ANYONE
AROUND TO HOLD ME BACK...

281
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,000
I GUESS SEEING YOU IN
TROUBLE DISTRACTED ME.

282
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,875
- YOU DIDN'T COME
HERE BY CHOICE.

283
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,791
AND YET YOU RUSHED OUT
SEVERAL LEAGUES AHEAD

284
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,166
OF YOUR OWN ENTOURAGE...

285
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,291
A BIT UNUSUAL, DON'T YOU THINK?

286
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,750
- I TOLD YOU, I WANTED
TO GET HERE FIRST

287
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,333
SO I COULD PUNCH
YOU IN THE DAMN FACE.

288
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:55,541
- YET HERE I STAND RESCUED
WITH NARY A WELT OR SCRATCH...

289
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,333
WHY NOT RAISE A FIST TO ME NOW?

290
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,208
I'D CERTAINLY DO
SO IN YOUR SHOES.

291
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,125
- HEY, IT'S NOT
TOO LATE FOR IT.

292
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,375
- YOU HAVE MY
GRATITUDE NONETHELESS...

293
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,291
I WOULD'VE BEEN DEAD IN MOMENTS
LEFT TO MY OWN DEVICES...

294
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,791
I AM IN YOUR DEBT, SIR.

295
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,000
- SO WHAT IN THE HELL WAS THAT
BLUE FLAME ALL ABOUT?

296
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,500
IS IT SAFE TO SAY
THERE'S A STORM BREWING?

297
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,166
- I COULDN'T SAY...

298
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,291
BUT IN ANY EVENT...

299
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,416
IT WOULD SEEM THAT
THE WINDS OF WAR...

300
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,166
ARE CLAMORING TO BLOW
OBSTACLES IN OUR PATH.

301
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,250
- ( wind blows )

302
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,000
- FIELD MARSHAL CLAUGH AND
LIEUTENANT GENERAL FROAUDE

303
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,041
ARE EN ROUTE TO THE
PALACE GATES, YOUR MAJESTY.

304
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,708
- EXCELLENT NEWS...
YOU MAY BE DISMISSED.

305
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:34,750
- Messenger: SIR.

306
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,666
- Sion: YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TIME.

307
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,666
- Lucile: A VERY INTRIGUING
MOVE, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

308
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,250
LIGHTNING BEASTS IS IT?

309
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,333
GHASTLY AS THEY MUST
APPEAR TO A NOVICE,

310
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,708
NOTHING SO OBVIOUS
WILL WORK AGAINST ME.

311
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,250
TO WHOMEVER SUMMONS
THESE FAMILIARS

312
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:05,041
IN HOPES OF EMPTYING
ROLAND'S THRONE, KNOW THIS...

313
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,958
YOU ARE NOTHING.

314
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,291
RETURN TO YOUR MASTER
AND TELL THEM...

315
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,583
HIS MAJESTY'S PROTECTOR...
IS NOT IMPRESSED.

316
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,458
THE PRESENCE HAS DIMINISHED...
SEEMS THEY'VE FLED.

317
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,750
- SHOULD WE NOT HAVE TRIED
TO ENSNARE THEM, THEN?

318
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,000
- THAT DECISION IS THE
PROVINCE OF THE KING...

319
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,333
IF YOU WOULD LIKE, SIR...

320
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,750
I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY
TO TRY AND GIVE CHASE.

321
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,541
- I WOULD NOT SO DIGNIFY THEM.

322
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:32,541
- AH, SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE KING.
TORN BUT NOT IN TATTERS...

323
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,416
YOU MAY YET WEATHER
THE COMING UPHEAVAL NICELY...

324
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,416
PERHAPS WITH ONE SO
DECISIVE AT THE HELM,

325
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,916
THE KINGDOM ITSELF
CAN HOPE TO SURVIVE.

326
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,166
- AND IF I CANNOT PROTECT
THE KINGDOM AS DEFTLY AS MYSELF?

327
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,875
- I'LL DIVEST YOU
OF CROWN AND LIFE

328
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,458
WHILE SOMEONE WHO
CAN TAKES YOUR PLACE...

329
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,125
UNTIL THAT DAY,

330
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,583
YOUR MAJESTY MAY DO
AS HE PLEASES.

331
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,708
- AS I PLEASE...

332
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:59,125
SOMETHING STIRS THUNDEROUSLY
OVERHEAD... SOMETHING BIG.

333
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,625
- Lir: A SWORD FAMILY...

334
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,750
THIS WHOLE DAMN KINGDOM'S
A BREEDING GROUND FOR FREAKS.

335
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,083
AND I DIDN'T EXACTLY PULL
THAT ONE OFF LIKE A PRO...

336
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,708
- Runa king: WHO IN HEAVEN'S
NAME ARE YOU WRETCHED PEOPLE?

337
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,625
- Sui: OH, DIDN'T I MENTION IT?
WE'RE GOODWILL AMBASSADORS.

338
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,166
- Kuu: IF IT HELPS AT ALL,
THINK OF US AS A PAIR OF HANDS

339
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,375
OUTSTRETCHED TO RUNA
IN FRIENDSHIP.

340
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,208
ON BEHALF OF
OUR KING, NATURALLY.

341
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,083
- Runa King: THE RUNA EMPIRE
HAS ALWAYS BEEN

342
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,416
A STEADFAST ALLY TO ROLAND!

343
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,708
- YES, A VERY STEADFAST
ALLY INDEED...

344
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,833
SO MUCH SO, YOU CONSPIRED
WITH THE NOBILITY

345
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,625
TO DISPOSE OF
THEIR CURRENT KING.

346
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,916
BUT, I'M AFRAID TO SAY

347
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,041
THAT YOUR UNOFFICIAL
CONTACT, DUKE STEARIED...

348
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,708
IS, COURTESY OF
OUR COUNTRYMAN, NO MORE.

349
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,083
- SUCH A TRAVESTY...

350
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,791
TO HAVE ONE'S MAN
ON THE INSIDE NEUTRALIZED.

351
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,416
- NOW THEN, LET ME PUT
THE QUESTION TO YOU BLUNTLY,

352
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,000
YOUR HIGHNESS,

353
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,166
WILL YOU OR WILL YOU NOT JOIN
FORCES WITH THE GASTARK EMPIRE?

354
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,291
WELL, THERE'S NO NEED
TO MAKE A RUSH DECISION...

355
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,791
WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT JOB
TO GET ON WITH AS IT IS...

356
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,458
WE DO LOOK FORWARD
TO YOUR RESPONSE, THOUGH...

357
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,166
OH SISTER, DEAR...
REMIND ME WHERE WE'RE HEADED?

358
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,666
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

359
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,333
MUST I ALWAYS LEAD YOU
BY THE SCRUFF

360
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,916
THROUGH EVERY TINY LITTLE
DETAIL OF OUR SPECIAL MISSION?

361
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,291
I MEAN, WHEN... ARE YOU GOING
TO STAND ON YOUR OWN FEET?

362
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,208
- SORRY, I JUST FORGOT.

363
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,291
- WELL I'M GIVING YOU FIVE
SECONDS TO UN-FORGET

364
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,625
BEFORE I PUMMEL YOU!

365
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,916
FIVE, FOUR...

366
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,166
- WAIT, HOLD ON, I...

367
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,291
BELIEVE WE WERE BOUND
FOR A VILLAGE, PERHAPS?

368
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,791
- THE TOWN OF REGIT!

369
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,916
WE'RE TO FIND
THE ALPHA STIGMA CHILD!

370
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,083
- MAN, THESE GUYS JUST DON'T
KNOW WHEN TO QUIT, DO...

371
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,708
( screams )

372
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,000
- HOP TO, RYNER.
THEY'RE GAINING ON US.

373
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:40,125
- YEAH, WELL IMPALING ME'S
NOT GONNA HELP...

374
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,375
- ON THE CONTRARY,
IT'S WORKING LIKE A CHARM.

375
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,166
PLUS I LIKE IT WHEN
YOU DANCE FOR ME!

376
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,125
- DEMON!

377
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:51,000
ABERRATIONS FLEE FROM THE
WATCHFUL EYES OF HEAVEN IN VAIN!

378
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,041
- THE EYES OF HEAVEN?
GIMME A BREAK.

379
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,166
- I IMPLORE THE GODS ABOVE
TO ENDOW THINE SERVANTS

380
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,583
WITH THE
DEMON-PIERCING ICE BLADE!

381
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,958
- I OFFER UP A CONTRACT TO
UNLEASH THE MAGIC BEAST OF LIGHT

382
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,750
WHO DANCES THROUGH THE SKIES!

383
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,166
- WHAT?

384
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,750
- HOW'S ARUA?
- STILL SOUND ASLEEP...

385
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,166
ARE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT TAKING
US BACK THROUGH REGIT?

386
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,583
- YEAH, IT'S BETTER
FOR EVERYONE

387
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,250
IF ARUA'S LITTLE
FRIEND COMES WITH US.

388
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,458
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

389
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,125
- AS LONG AS THE TWO
OF THEM STAY THERE,

390
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,375
THE TOWNSPEOPLE WILL
GIVE THEM NOTHING BUT GRIEF...

391
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,625
I WANT TO TRY AND HELP THEM FIND
A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN LIVE

392
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,208
IN SOMETHING LIKE PEACE.

393
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,250
( screams )

394
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,041
- THEN THERE'S NO TIME TO LOSE!

395
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,625
ANOTHER ROUND OF PURSUERS IS
CLOSING THE GAP BETWEEN

396
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:37,458
AS WE SPEAK!

397
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,500
DANCE, OUTLAW, DANCE!

398
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:39,708
- OW! DAMN IT, STOP!

399
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,666
THAT REALLY FREAKIN' HURTS!
KNOCK IT OFF!

400
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,541
( yells )

401
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,125
- Woman 1: I HEAR PASSING
THE ENTRY INSPECTION HERE

402
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,333
IS PRETTY TOUGH.

403
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,333
- Man 1: 'CAUSE STOHL
TROOPS GET PAMPERED

404
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,750
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

405
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,458
- Man 2: KEEPS 'EM HAPPY
WHILE THEY SCRAP SHIELDS

406
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,791
WITH GASTARK.

407
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,125
- Man 3: BUT I HEAR THAT
LITTLE NORTHERN BACKWATER

408
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,125
IS KIND OF A DARK HORSE.

409
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,416
- Man 4: PLEASE. THEY'RE
NOT EVEN A REAL COUNTRY.

410
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,000
STOHL'S GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

411
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:04,583
- Kiefer: ROLAND... CASSLA...
ESTOLIA... STOHL.

412
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:05,625
- Soldier: NEXT!

413
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,666
- HERE!

414
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,375
- ( theme song playing )

415
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,333
- Ryner: OKAY, I'M GETTING
REALLY SICK AND TIRED

416
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,708
OF STUPID CRAP JUST
FALLING OUT OF THE SKY AT US

417
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:44,958
WHEREVER WE GO.

418
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,666
GASTARK'S NEXT?

419
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,208
SCREW THAT,
I'M NOT GOING UP NORTH!

420
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,500
LIKE IT'S MY FAULT THE DUMB
BASTARDS CAN'T STAY PUT!

421
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,166
UGH, THIS TOTALLY SUCKS...
