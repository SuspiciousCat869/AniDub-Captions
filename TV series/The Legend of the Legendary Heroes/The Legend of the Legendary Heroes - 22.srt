1
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,250
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,250
- Lieral: RYNER.

3
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,625
- WHAT THE HELL? YOU CAN'T BE...

4
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,500
- TOO SLOW.

5
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,291
- ( groaning )

6
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,958
- WELCOME BACK, MY SON.

7
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:46,333
- Lucile: NO SUCH ACT GOES
UNPUNISHED UPON MY WATCH.

8
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,791
- WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?

9
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:54,708
- IT'S BEEN SOME TIME, HASN'T
IT NOW, DUKE LIERAL LIEUTOLU?

10
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,250
- INDEED IT HAS.

11
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,708
AND, MY, HOW YOU'VE GROWN UP
IN THE INTERVAL, LUCILE ERIS.

12
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,666
- THE BOY HAS NOT YET
REACHED THE POINT

13
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,125
WHERE HE MAY SAFELY STEP
THROUGH THE DOOR.

14
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,250
- ALAS, THAT IS NOT A DECISION
OVER WHICH YOU HAVE ANY CONTROL.

15
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,583
- THEN I'VE NO CHOICE
BUT TO SEE YOU AS A THREAT.

16
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,583
- AH, WELL,
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS?

17
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,541
- BRANDISHED IN VAIN, GOOD SIR.

18
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,083
HERO RELICS HAVE NO EFFECT ON
THOSE OF MY ILK.

19
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,291
- SO YOU SAY. HOWEVER...

20
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,458
SMASH IT TO BITS, SIPUAMUS.

21
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,166
WHEN NEXT OUR
TWO PATHS INTERSECT,

22
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,000
I HOPE TO HAVE
DISCOVERED A CURSE

23
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,625
THAT CAN EFFECT YOU, OLD FRIEND.

24
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,375
- LUCILE...
- THE THREAT HAS PASSED.

25
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:08,958
- AND DUKE LIEUTOLU?
- ESCAPED, I'M AFRAID.

26
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,875
- HOW UNLIKE YOU.
YOUR ABILITIES ARE SLIPPING.

27
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,375
- ( chuckling )

28
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,250
IT IS AMUSING TO HEAR
SUCH REMARKS

29
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,333
BECOME SECOND NATURE
TO YOU, SIR.

30
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,541
- DUKE LIEUTOLU,
THE DEATH-DEFYING SPECTER

31
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,958
WHO STALKS THE SHADOWS
OF THIS KINGDOM.

32
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,458
SEE THAT HE DEFIES
DEATH NO MORE.

33
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,000
- WITH PLEASURE, SIR.

34
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,166
THE AXES HAVE SHIFTED
BENEATH MY NOTICE.

35
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,250
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT I HAVE
MUCH TO ABSORB MOVING FORWARD.

36
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,958
YOU HAVE INDEED, SIR,
BECOME THE IDEAL RULER.

37
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,208
LET ALL BE AS YOU COMMAND IT.

38
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,750
- ( door closing )

39
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,958
- ( Sion retching )

40
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,041
I HAVE DESIRED
NOTHING SO MUCH AS THIS.

41
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,625
THAT THE WHOLE
WORLD BE PURIFIED,

42
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,458
RELEASED FROM CORRUPTION.

43
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,166
I WILL ASK
A VOLLEY OF QUESTIONS.

44
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,750
EACH ONE AFTER ITS OWN
MANNER FOLLOWING THE SKEIN

45
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,333
OF A COMMON THREAD.

46
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:18,708
SHOULD YOUR ANSWERS STRIKE ME
AS UNSUITABLE, I'LL KILL YOU.

47
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,416
- VERY WELL. THEN I
WILL AGREE TO THE TEST.

48
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,958
ASK OF ME WHATEVER YOU DESIRE.

49
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,875
- ( chuckling ) GOOD. I DIDN'T
ANTICIPATE YOU'D RESIST.

50
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,291
COME WITH ME, PLEASE.

51
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,458
- THE PATH BEFORE ME
IS SET IN STONE.

52
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:54,333
THOSE FOOLISH ENOUGH,
CRAZY ENOUGH TO BLOCK THE WAY

53
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,916
SHALL FALL BY MY HAND.

54
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,833
I ACCEPT WHATEVER PRICE
FATE CARES TO NAME...

55
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,458
EVEN IF IT BE MY SOUL.

56
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,916
- BRAVE MAN.

57
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,625
HOW LONG I HAVE WAITED.

58
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:19,041
BECOME MY MASTER. CAST ASIDE
THE CARES OF YOUR FORMER SELF,

59
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,333
OFFER UP THE SLOUGH
AS SACRIFICE.

60
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,125
BECOME THE WIELDER OF MY BLADE.

61
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,458
YOU ARE HE THAT SHALL RIP
THE WORLD ASUNDER

62
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,333
AND CONSUME WHAT REMAINS,

63
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,041
A HERO.

64
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,875
- SO, LET US DO AS WE INTENDED.

65
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:43,125
- Sion's Other: I FORBID IT.
YOUR WAY SHALL NOT PREVAIL.

66
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,833
WHAT YOU WANT
IS A FOOL'S GAME.

67
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:54,583
- ( laughing ) SHOULD I FEAR
A WANING IMPOSTER?

68
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:58,166
- CHILDISH SOUL,
'TIS YOU ARE THE IMPOSTER.

69
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,875
- IT IS YOU.

70
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,833
STILL, YOUR POWER DIMINISHES.

71
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,958
- I DOUBT THE IDIOT COULD
GET HIMSELF KILLED SO EASILY.

72
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,500
STOP WHERE YOU ARE.

73
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:21,166
- A RAVISHING YOUNG WOMAN
HAILS ME FORCIBLY IN THE STREET.

74
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,916
HOW FLATTERING.

75
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:30,125
- YOU BASTARD. TELL ME EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO MY FRIEND.

76
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,791
ANSWER ME NOW!

77
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,875
- CARE FOR HIM
THAT MUCH, DO YOU?

78
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,000
( laughing ) I SEE.

79
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,541
- BE QUIET!

80
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,958
- CONGRATULATIONS, MY BOY.

81
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,250
AT FIRST BLUSH, THIS ONE
SEEMS QUITE A CATCH.

82
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,083
- ( Ferris grunting )

83
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,541
- IMPRESSIVE.

84
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:53,250
I MUST CONFESS, THOUGH, I'D
LIKE TO SEE YOU MORE SERIOUS.

85
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,291
- I DON'T KNOW WHO
OR WHAT YOU THINK YOU ARE.

86
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,083
BUT THOSE WHO
UNDERESTIMATE ME PERISH.

87
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,708
- DO THEY NOW?
- DON'T MOCK ME!

88
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,583
( grunting )

89
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:13,166
- IT'S NOW ROUGHLY THREE TIMES
THE WEIGHT YOU'RE ACCUSTOMED TO.

90
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,333
SORRY, BUT THE ODDS
ARE AGAINST YOU.

91
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,333
NOW, THAT SAID,

92
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,166
I'M ONLY TOO HAPPY TO ANSWER
YOUR EARLIER QUESTION.

93
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,500
I KILLED HIM.

94
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,583
I PLUNGED A BLADE
INTO HIS HEART.

95
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,916
HE SPUTTERED WITH THE MOST
CONFUSED EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE.

96
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,416
- LIAR.
- IF ONLY I WERE.

97
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,208
NO, I'M AFRAID HE'S DEAD.

98
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,250
THE FACT IS PLAIN ENOUGH
IF YOU TRULY LOOK.

99
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,791
- ( crying )

100
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,250
- OH, DEAR. I'VE MADE YOU CRY.

101
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,208
- I'LL... I'LL KILL YOU!

102
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:53,000
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
- I'LL KILL YOU! YOU SON OF A...

103
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,000
( yelling )

104
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,791
( gasps )

105
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:08,083
- YOU PASS.
FORGIVE THE DECEPTION.

106
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,083
THERE IS A GLIMMER OF HOPE
IN HOW DEEPLY YOU CARE

107
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,750
FOR HIM AFTER ALL.

108
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,750
- SO WHERE IN THE HELL
AM I NOW?

109
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,416
- Alpha Beast: I AM
DESTRUCTION INCARNATE.

110
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,958
I BRING FORTH NOTHING. I BLESS
NOTHING. I SAVE NOTHING.

111
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:52,166
I ONLY ERASE...COMPLETELY.

112
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:57,416
AND I HAVE WAITED AGES
FOR THIS DAY TO COME.

113
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,416
( laughing )

114
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,875
( laughing continues )

115
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:18,208
IMAGINE SUCH A PALTRY IMITATION
ASPIRING TO SEAL ME?

116
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,250
SHED YOUR AMBITIONS!

117
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,708
BY CONSUMING YOU,
THE SEAL SHATTERS.

118
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,291
I ACHIEVE ALPHA STATUS
AND ALL PLAYS OUT

119
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,000
ACCORDING TO THE CONTRACT.

120
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,958
TO DUST WITH YOU,
SOLVER OF ALL FORMULAS!

121
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,166
- Milk: A HUMAN EXPERIMENT?
- Luke: YES.

122
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,333
REPORTS SAY IT FLED
THE TESTING FACILITY

123
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,875
IN THRALL TO A KIND OF
HOMICIDAL RAGE.

124
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,125
CERTAIN, UNIQUE ABILITIES
IMPARTED TO IT

125
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,458
DURING THE EXPERIMENTATION

126
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,500
BRING THE SITUATION
FIRMLY INTO OUR DOMAIN.

127
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,958
WE'RE DEALING WITH
A TABOO BREAKER.

128
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:57,000
- Man: KILL... KILL...

129
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,541
- Milk: I'M CONFUSED.

130
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,208
I THOUGHT HUMAN
EXPERIMENTATION WAS FORBIDDEN

131
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,916
UNDER THREAT OF BANISHMENT
AFTER SION ASSUMED THE THRONE.

132
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,416
I AM MILK CALLAUD,

133
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,041
CAPTAIN OF ROLAND'S ELITE TABOO
BREAKER PURSUIT SQUADRON.

134
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,750
WE'RE HERE ON OFFICIAL BUSINESS.

135
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,125
IT'S COME TO OUR ATTENTION
THAT YOU FLED ROLAND'S BORDERS

136
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,625
SHORTLY AFTER ACQUIRING A LEVEL
OF PROFICIENCY IN ILLICIT...

137
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,416
THAT IS NOT HELPFUL!

138
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,875
- OUR ORDERS ARE TO ELIMINATE
IT, NOT TO REASON WITH IT.

139
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,708
- ( grunting )

140
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,583
- IS SION AWARE OF THIS?

141
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,958
- THE EXPERIMENTS
WERE CARRIED OUT

142
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,750
ACCORDING TO HIS
STRICT INSTRUCTIONS.

143
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,250
- IS HIS MAJESTY STILL
POSSESSED OF HIS SENSES?

144
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,000
- HE IS VERY MUCH
IN CONTROL OF HIMSELF, YES.

145
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:06,416
HE RECANTED HIS MORAL STANCE
ON THE ISSUE OUT OF NECESSITY.

146
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,750
- I SEE. YOU'VE ALL KNOWN ABOUT
THIS FOR A WHILE, HAVEN'T YOU?

147
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,916
AND AGAIN YOU TAKE
IT UPON YOURSELVES

148
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,583
TO SHIELD ME FROM AN UGLY,
INCONVENIENT TRUTH,

149
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,791
TO PROTECT ME FROM
THE DARKNESS OF ROLAND.

150
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:26,500
- IF I CAN DIE NOW
PEACEFULLY...

151
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,416
WILL I NEVER HAVE TO
GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN?

152
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:38,083
- SO, IF YOU SOMEHOW MAKE IT
TO ADULTHOOD AND STUFF,

153
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,333
DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT
WANT TO MARRY ME?

154
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:47,875
IF YOU DO, WE COULD BE TOGETHER
FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

155
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,041
- Instructor: IT'S TIME.
MOVE IT.

156
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,750
- IT'S OKAY, I GET YOU.

157
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,500
NO POINT MAKING A PROMISE
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE

158
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,416
LIFE WON'T LET YOU KEEP, RIGHT?

159
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,708
NEITHER OF US IS GOING TO
MAKE IT TO ADULTHOOD.

160
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,500
- Young Ryner: HEY.

161
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:07,791
TWO THINGS YOU DO TOO MUCH,
TALK ABOUT DEATH AND CRY.

162
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,625
YOU'RE TOUGHER THAN YOU THINK.
YOU'RE BOUND TO MAKE IT.

163
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,791
AND IF YOU SURVIVE, THEN I'VE
GOT A PRETTY GOOD SHOT MYSELF.

164
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,333
- THINK SO?

165
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,375
- SO THEN, WHAT ABOUT
YOUR END OF THE BARGAIN?

166
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,833
- MMM-HMM.

167
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:28,250
YOU POOR THING.

168
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,500
I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE ME

169
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,416
FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO
SPARE YOUR LIFE.

170
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,500
ALL I CAN DO IS TRY TO
COMFORT YOU. I'M SORRY.

171
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,833
WHETHER SION HAS DRIVEN THIS
COUNTRY TO THE BRINK OR NOT,

172
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:49,541
FOR YOUR SAKE, RYNER,
FOR YOUR SAKE...

173
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:53,666
BECAUSE IT'S YOUR HOME, I'LL
DEFEND IT TO THE BLOODY END.

174
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,458
- ( grunting )

175
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:04,250
- ( groaning ) DAMN YOU, SOLVER!

176
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:08,208
YOU WOULD PROFANE ME WITH SUCH
A MEAGER BINDING CURSE?

177
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,958
( roaring )

178
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,666
- ANTICLIMACTIC.

179
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,291
- Woman: QUICKLY, RYNER.

180
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,916
- UH, YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

181
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,041
- ( woman gasping )

182
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:45,041
MY SON...
LOOK HOW BIG YOU'VE GOTTEN.

183
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,833
OH, LIERAL, YOU'VE BOUGHT
OUR PRECIOUS SON SOME TIME.

184
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,875
I'VE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS.

185
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,375
TO FINALLY SEE YOU
ALL GROWN UP, TO HOLD YOU.

186
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,000
- ARE YOU SERIOUS? BUT...

187
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,708
- I LOVE YOU, RYNER.
I ALWAYS HAVE.

188
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,125
- ( Alpha Beast roaring )

189
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,166
- HURRY, NOW...

190
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,208
QUICKLY, BEFORE THE WEAVER
OF ALL FORMULAS BEARS FORTH.

191
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,083
GET INSIDE.
YOU JUST HAVE TO TOUCH THE DOOR.

192
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,708
- THE DOOR?
- MMM-HMM.

193
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,833
IT'S THE FIRST AND ONLY
WAY TO PROTECT THAT

194
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,416
WHICH YOU HOLD DEAREST.

195
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,208
- Alpha Beast: SILENCE, PALTRY
OFFERING! YOU DARE TO INTERVENE?

196
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,208
YOUR PLACE IS ON MY ALTAR!

197
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:33,625
- IT'S A PITY.
I COULD HAVE HELD YOU FOR DAYS.

198
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,833
TOLD YOU HOW MUCH I LOVED YOU
FOR AN ETERNITY.

199
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,791
I'M SO SORRY
I COULDN'T BE THERE

200
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,583
TO WATCH YOU GROW UP AS
A MOTHER SHOULD.

201
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,083
- ( gasping )

202
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,375
DAMN IT! SON OF A BITCH!

203
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,000
SOMEBODY MIND TELLING ME WHAT
THE HELL I'M SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

204
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,875
- Alpha Beast: YOU WON'T ESCAPE!

205
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,041
THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU SCAMPER

206
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,083
SHALL BE THE PYRE BY
WHICH I CONSUME YOU!

207
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,166
- I'M ALMOST THERE!

208
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,250
( grunting )

209
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,166
-HELP ME. PLEASE.

210
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:36,583
I HAVE NO CHOICE.
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

211
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,916
I AM COMPELLED TO DEVOUR YOU.

212
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,666
- ( gasping )

213
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,333
HOW DID I GET HERE?

214
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,958
OKAY, THE LAST THING I REMEMBER
IS BEING SKEWERED.

215
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,500
- ( Ferris groaning )
- ( Ryner exclaims )

216
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,833
- WHERE AM I?

217
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,916
- UH, HI. MORNING, FERRIS.

218
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,416
SO, YOU SLEEP OKAY?

219
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,000
- YOU PERVERT!

220
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:24,041
- YOU CAN'T HOPE TO SAVE RYNER
BY BACKING INTO FEAR.

221
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,625
- IT IS YOU
WHO BACKS INTO FEAR!

222
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,375
YOU EVOKE THE WORLD'S SALVATION
AS A RATIONALE.

223
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,166
IN TRUTH YOU SOLD OUT A FRIEND!

224
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,166
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH!
- DAMN IT, I WILL SPEAK!

225
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,125
I AM NOT COWED BY YOU! I AM THE
ONE WHO MEANS BEST FOR HIM!

226
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,166
- YOU SCREAM IN A VACUUM.

227
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,416
RUNNING FROM HARD CHOICES,
FROM FEAR, FROM PAIN,

228
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,791
DOES NOT AUGER WELL FOR YOU
AS HIS SAVIOR.

229
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:50,208
I CONFRONT MY CHOICES.
I MOVE FORWARD.

230
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,791
- OVER MY DEAD BODY.

231
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,250
- WRENCH HIM FROM THE CLUTCHES
OF DARKNESS IF YOU'RE ABLE!

232
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,375
LET US SEE
THIS STRENGTH OF YOURS!

233
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,208
PROVE TO US THIS
INCESSANT WAITING

234
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,125
WAS JUST PART OF THE PLAN!

235
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,708
YOUR VENOM WILL NOT
DETER ME IN MY PURPOSE.

236
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:11,500
- CAN YOU DO IT?
- I CAN.

237
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,916
I WILL KILL RYNER. BEFORE THE
FINAL MADNESS CLAIMS HIM.

238
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:21,250
AS I DO, YOU MAY
WRAP YOURSELF IN SLEEP.

239
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,250
LET THE END OF THIS
BE ON MY SHOULDERS.

240
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:46,041
- WELL? DARE I ASK WHICH
PART OF YOU WON OUT?

241
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,208
HAS A HINT OF CLOSURE
PRESENTED ITSELF

242
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,291
ON THE MATTER OF RYNER LUTE?

243
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,625
- ( sighing )

244
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,833
SO THEN, SAFE TO SAY
YOU HAVE NO REAL MEMORY

245
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,333
OF WHAT HAPPENED EITHER?

246
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,125
- YES. THOUGH I FEEL SURE I WAS
MEANT TO WALK AWAY FROM IT

247
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,875
WITH SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT.

248
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:20,291
- WELL, NO TELLING
WHAT THAT COULD'VE BEEN.

249
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,458
WHAT IS THIS?

250
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,125
- HMM?
- ( footsteps approaching )

251
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,625
- ( banging on door )

252
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,208
- ( theme song playing )

253
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,041
- THE KEY TO THIS IS FINDING

254
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:14,500
WHAT THE SOLVER OF
ALL FORMULAS IS.

255
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,833
- Lefahl: SO YOU'VE ALREADY
RUMMAGED THROUGH

256
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,833
THAT LITTLE CLOAK BAG, HAVE YOU?

257
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:21,208
I'M GLAD I KEPT AN EYE ON YOU.
YOU'RE FULL OF SURPRISES.

258
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,500
- YOUR EAR'S BEEN TO THE GROUND,

259
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,916
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING
ON IN ROLAND

260
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,833
WHILE WE SIT HERE TRADING QUIPS.

261
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,875
PLEASE TELL ME WHAT IT MEANS.

262
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,375
- ONLY IF YOU ANSWER HONESTLY

263
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,041
AND TELL ME WHETHER YOU ASK
FOR RYNER'S SAKE.

264
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,750
A HERO ONCE FOUGHT BITTERLY TO
BE THE WORLD'S SOLE SALVATION.

265
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:42,583
HE SOUGHT AFTER FORBIDDEN POWER
AND WAS SEALED AWAY

266
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,666
TO BREAK IT.

267
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,125
BUT ONE CHOICE LAY BEFORE HIM.

268
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,458
HE MUST EAT THE ONE REFERRED
TO AS THE LONESOME DEVIL.

269
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,583
- THE ONE REFERRED TO
AS THE LONESOME DEVIL.

270
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,416
- ( door opening )

271
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,166
- ( sighing )

272
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,958
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

273
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,791
- VERY SOON, GASTARK
WILL LAUNCH AN INVASION

274
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,083
OF THE INNER CONTINENT.

275
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,166
I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO
RESIST THE SIREN SONG

276
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,250
OF ROLAND WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

277
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,541
JUST PROMISE ME, WITH WHAT TIME
YOU'LL HAVE, YOU'LL SAVE RYNER

278
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,416
BEFORE SION ASTAL REALIZES
AN UNTHINKABLE BETRAYAL.

279
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,750
- BUT YOU'RE WRONG. IF YOU CAN
SAY THAT, YOU DON'T KNOW SION.

280
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,708
- "TO BECOME
THE WORLD'S SALVATION,

281
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:27,458
"THE FALLEN BLACK HERO WILL
CONSUME THE LONESOME DEVIL."

282
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,583
BEFORE RYNER LUTE IS DEVOURED,

283
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,166
BEFORE HE'S DELIVERED OVER TO
MADNESS AND DESPAIR,

284
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,208
DO WHAT YOU CAN TO SAVE HIM.

285
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,708
BEFORE THE BLACK HERO
BREAKS HIS SEAL.

286
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,041
BEAR IN MIND, I TRUST
YOU TO BRING HIM HERE.

287
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,125
FIND YOUR WAY BACK TO ME.

288
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,458
THE ACHE OF UNREQUITED LOVE...

289
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:02,875
- MAJESTY, ALL OF THE
PREPARATIONS ARE IN ORDER.

290
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,291
- UNDERSTOOD.

291
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:07,000
THE TIME IS UPON US!

292
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:10,083
TODAY WE LOCK HORNS
WITH THE FUTURE!

293
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:13,000
WITH HEARTS FREE OF FEAR...

294
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,833
MAKE THE WORLD OF OUR DREAMS!

295
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,541
- ALL HAIL THE VISION
OF OUR WARRIOR KING!

296
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,291
- ( all cheering )

297
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,458
- SALLY FORTH!

298
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,833
- OH, RYNER.

299
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:52,250
- Ryner: SION, THANK YOU.
