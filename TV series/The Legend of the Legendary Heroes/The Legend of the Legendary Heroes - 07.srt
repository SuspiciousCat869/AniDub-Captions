1
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,916
- ( Milk sobbing )

2
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:25,625
I CAN'T TAKE IT! I CAN'T!

3
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,041
NO MORE!

4
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,250
- ( lightning crashes )

5
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,583
- ( children screaming )

6
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,916
- ( man grunting )

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,708
- Man: THOSE WHO CAN'T SURVIVE
ARE DISPOSABLE!

8
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,500
STRENGTH AND HONOR
FOR THE NATION OF ROLAND

9
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,958
ARE THE ONLY REASONS
YOU HAVE TO EXIST!

10
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,500
- ( Milk whimpers and groans )

11
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,583
- ( Milk sobbing )

12
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,208
- Ryner: IDIOT!
- UH?

13
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,250
RYNER?

14
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:14,208
- I'LL WHIP YOU LIKE A DOG!

15
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,708
YOU'RE BLUBBERING WHEN YOU
SHOULD BE THANKFUL

16
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,458
YOU STILL HAVE
BREATH IN YOUR LUNGS!

17
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,333
- YOU HAVE TO
GET STRONGER, OKAY?

18
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:20,458
- YES, BUT...

19
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:23,041
I CAN'T BEAR IT ANY LONGER!

20
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,166
SO MUCH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION!

21
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,708
- I KNOW. BUT WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

22
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,416
GET UP.

23
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,083
- ( Milk exclaims )

24
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,583
- TRUST ME. HOLD ON TO MY HAND
AND DON'T EVER LET GO.

25
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,541
- ( gasps )

26
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,708
- ( theme song playing )

27
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,291
- ( men groaning )

28
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,875
( groaning intensifies )

29
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,666
- Ryner: HUH?

30
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,375
HUH? THIS IS SO...
I... WHAT THE...

31
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,375
( laughing nervously )

32
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,208
( groans )

33
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,750
- Ferris: SO IS IT SAFE TO SAY
YOU'VE MADE

34
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,833
YET ANOTHER
INCORRECT ASSUMPTION?

35
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,750
- ACCORDING TO LEGEND
THIS FORTRESS WAS BUILT HERE

36
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,291
FOR A SINGLE PURPOSE,

37
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,208
TO SAFEGUARD AN ARTIFACT
BEST KEPT UNDER WRAPS,

38
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,916
WHICH COULD MEAN A HERO RELIC.

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,750
BUT THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

40
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,666
ALL I'M FINDING ARE
DETAILED RECORDS OF TAX EVASION.

41
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,416
- AND ONCE AGAIN, YOUR
INSTINCTS HAVE LED US NOWHERE.

42
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,958
WELL? ANY FINAL WORDS?

43
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:15,958
- WAIT! HOLD ON!

44
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,458
DON'T DO ANYTHING
RASH, ALL RIGHT?

45
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,708
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEGLECTED TO MENTION.

46
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,291
WHERE IS IT?

47
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,750
HISTORY HAS IT THAT LYING
NOT VERY FAR FROM THIS PLACE

48
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,083
IS A SWORD THAT ONCE BELONGED

49
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,000
TO A HERO FAMOUS FOR
ALL KINDS OF CRAZY EXPLOITS

50
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,125
BACK IN THE OLD DAYS.

51
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,041
- AND?
- AND, UH...

52
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,333
WELL, YOU REMEMBER
THE LITTLE SPOT

53
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,750
WHERE WE CAMPED YESTERDAY?

54
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:36,791
IN THE WOODS?

55
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,625
- UM-HM.

56
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,541
- UM, OKAY.

57
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,125
SEE, THE THING IS,
THE MAP HAD AN "X"

58
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,750
VERY CLOSE TO
WHERE WE MADE CAMP.

59
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,041
- IS THAT RIGHT? AND WHY DID YOU
"NEGLECT" TO MENTION THAT, HUH?

60
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,208
- WELL, BECAUSE...

61
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,416
WHEN I LOOKED AROUND
I JUST COULDN'T FIND

62
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,833
ANY TRACE
OF THE SWORD,

63
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,666
I ASSUMED IT'D BEEN
MADE OFF WITH,

64
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,875
OR THAT IT GOT BURIED.

65
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,291
- BURIED?

66
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,791
- YOU CAN'T SERIOUSLY EXPECT ME
TO SIFT THROUGH DIRT!

67
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,500
I DO NOT DO EXCAVATION.

68
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,958
- YOUR LETHARGY REPULSES ME.

69
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,666
- NO, WAIT! I'M SORRY,
I KNOW I'M LAZY,

70
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,875
BUT I DON'T DESERVE TO DIE!

71
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,416
NOW, YOU'VE BEEN
STALKING US FOR SOME TIME.

72
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
WHO ARE YOU?
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?

73
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,416
- YEAH, WHAT SHE SAID!

74
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,750
IF YOU'RE HERE TO FIGHT,
COULD YOU GET ON WITH IT.

75
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:15,916
- Kuu: AH, DAMN!

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,875
THANKS TO YOUR INABILITY
TO BE DISCREET,

77
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,666
THEY'VE FOUND US OUT, SUI!

78
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,875
- HEY, HOW IS THIS MY FAULT?

79
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,833
- OH, HOW IS IT NOT?
DAMN! DAMN! DAMN!

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
BE PREPARED. THE TREASURE
WE SEEK IS RIGHT HERE.

81
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,500
IF THEY OVERRUN US, BE READY TO
TAKE TO YOUR HEELS AND FLEE.

82
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,791
OH! SUI, YOU'RE MY BROTHER
AND I LOVE YOU,

83
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,833
BUT YOUR WAY
OF LIFE JUST WON'T DO!

84
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,333
THE PLIGHT OF
A POOR STARVING ARTIST

85
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,708
ISN'T BEFITTING A YOUNG MAN

86
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,000
WHO IS OVER
A QUARTER OF A CENTURY OLD!

87
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,416
I'M STUCK CARING FOR A
PENNILESS FOOL WHO DOES NOTHING

88
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,916
BUT DREAM THE DAY AWAY WHILE
HIS REAL LIFE PASSES HIM BY!

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
- I'M ASHAMED OF
MY WAYWARD WAYS.

90
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,708
MY ONLY DREAM
IS YOUR HAPPINESS, KUU.

91
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,541
- WHILE WE'RE ON THIS SUBJECT,

92
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,666
MAY WE BE SO BOLD AS TO ASK FOR
A PORTION OF THE TREASURE,

93
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,666
PRETTY PLEASE?

94
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,916
- PLEASE, BE KIND.

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,541
MY BELOVED SISTER
NEEDS MONEY FOR HER DOWRY.

96
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:04,875
- Both: HMM.

97
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,083
- GO!

98
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,041
- ( papers rustling )

99
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,541
- Kuu: OH, NO! THIS CAN'T BE!
- Sui: WHAT? HUH?

100
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,041
- THERE'S NO TREASURE IN HERE,
IT'S JUST JUNK!

101
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,583
- NO WAY!

102
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,166
- FESS UP! WHERE DID YOU
HIDE THE TREASURE, YOU ROGUE?

103
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,458
- THERE WAS NOTHIN' HERE
FOR US TO HIDE, MISSY.

104
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,166
- HOLD ON! IF THIS FORTRESS
DOESN'T CONCEAL HIDDEN TREASURE,

105
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,375
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

106
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,166
- HUH? IT'S FUNNY
YOU SHOULD ASK THAT.

107
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,291
WE'RE ON A QUEST
IN SEARCH OF HERO RELI--

108
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,583
( groaning )

109
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,708
- JUST IGNORE HIM.

110
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,291
AT THE BEHEST OF EMPEROR NELPHI,

111
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,375
WE'VE BEEN DISPATCHED
ON A VERY SECRET MISSION.

112
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,875
MORE I CANNOT SAY.

113
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,666
- OH! THEN I SEE NO REASON
FOR US TO LINGER HERE.

114
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,333
COME ON, SUI. LET'S GO.

115
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,541
- ( chuckling ) SORRY IF WE WERE
ANY TROUBLE.

116
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,708
- ( Ryner groans and sighs )

117
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,375
- ( Sui chuckling )

118
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,583
- A SECRET MISSION
FROM THE KING OF NELPHA, HUH?

119
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,041
- Milk: EAT UP, BOYS!

120
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,291
HMM? WHAT'S WRONG?

121
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,583
ARE YOU COMING DOWN
WITH SOMETHING?

122
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,708
YOU'VE HARDLY EVEN
TOUCHED YOUR FOOD.

123
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,875
- NO! THAT'S NOT IT.

124
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,291
IT'S JUST SINCE WE CAME HERE,

125
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,208
NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK OUT
THE WAY WE HOPED IT WOULD.

126
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,041
- Lach: I KNOW, RIGHT?

127
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,041
WHAT WE NEED IS A LEAD.

128
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,375
MAYBE THAT TABOO-BREAKER

129
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,916
WILL SLIP UP AND USE SOME
SPLASHY MAGIC IN PUBLIC.

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,875
- Moe: YOU SHOULDN'T SAY THAT.

131
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,166
IF HE USES HIS POWERS OPENLY,

132
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,875
THAT COULD EXPOSE
THE SECRETS OF OUR MAGIC

133
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,791
TO PEOPLE IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

134
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,000
- Luke: MOE'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

135
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,291
IF OUR SECRETS ARE UNCOVERED,
ALL IS LOST.

136
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:33,791
WE MUST REMEMBER.

137
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,791
WE ARE PROTECTING
THE ROLAND EMPIRE.

138
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,083
NO MATTER HOW
IT IS ACCOMPLISHED,

139
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,583
OUR TARGET MUST BE STOPPED.

140
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,666
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

141
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,208
- Milk: A TABOO-BREAKER WHO
BECAME A MASTER OF OUR MAGIC

142
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,958
AND THEN ABSCONDED
TO A NEIGHBORING LAND

143
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,333
WITH OUR HALLOWED SECRETS.

144
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,000
FOR THE GOOD OF OUR PEOPLE
AND THE SECURITY

145
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,208
OF OUR NATION'S FUTURE,

146
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,541
THE SUCCESS OF THIS MISSION
IS PARAMOUNT.

147
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,583
FOR LORD SION, WE MUST PREVAIL.

148
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,416
AND WE WILL.

149
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,791
- Luke: OH, I MUST HAVE
FORGOTTEN MY MANNERS.

150
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,083
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TRY SOME DESSERT?

151
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,666
- YOU GUYS! THIS LOOKS GREAT!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

152
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,666
OH, WOW!

153
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,625
- SHE IS PERFECTION!

154
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,791
- I SWEAR, THAT LOOK ON HER FACE
IS ENOUGH TO MELT YOUR HEART!

155
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,041
- ( giggles )

156
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,083
- ( exclaims )

157
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,000
- CAPTAIN, IS SOMETHING
THE MATTER?

158
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,125
- Moe: IT'S YOUR FAULT, LACH.

159
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,791
WAY TO MAKE HER
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE!

160
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,833
- Lach: OH, COME ON.
I WASN'T MAKING FUN OF HER.

161
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,625
- NO, NO. I'M OKAY. I'M FINE.

162
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,500
I WAS JUST THINKING OF
HOW LUCKY WE ALL ARE

163
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,666
TO BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN

164
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
AND HAVE A NICE MEAL
TOGETHER AND I...

165
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,250
I JUST...

166
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,125
- UM, HELLO THERE.
PLEASE EXCUSE US.

167
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,458
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

168
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,833
YOU'RE THE ONES
GATHERING INFORMATION

169
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,375
ON TABOO-BREAKERS, RIGHT?

170
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,750
- UH-HUH.

171
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,916
- WE'RE NO EXPERTS,
BUT WE MAY HAVE STUMBLED

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,833
ON A PAIR OF SOULS
THAT FIT THE PROFILE.

173
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,291
- I WANT YOU TO
TELL ME EVERYTHING!

174
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,333
- ( footsteps approaching )

175
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,375
- FIOLE.

176
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,583
FORGIVE MY
NOT COMING HERE SOONER.

177
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,708
IT SEEMS SITTING
ON A THRONE'S NOT ENOUGH.

178
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,208
I SPEAK WITH SUCH FALSE CONCEIT.

179
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,875
BUT I'M CRIPPLED.

180
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,625
THE NOBLES STILL THRIVE.

181
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,833
- Claugh: YOU'RE MAJESTY,
I'M SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING YOU.

182
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,208
- THIS IS FIOLE FOLKAL'S
YOUNGER SISTER.

183
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,916
ESLINA, THIS IS OUR KING.

184
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:50,833
- I BEG YOU NOT TO LET GRIEF
OVERSHADOW MY BROTHER'S MEMORY.

185
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,708
TEARS DO NOT HONOR HIM.

186
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,458
MY BROTHER WAS
A HAPPY PERSON, SIRE.

187
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,125
HE SPOKE OFTEN OF HIS DUTY.

188
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,583
HE WAS HONORED TO BE
IN SERVICE OF THE KING.

189
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:09,416
AS A SUBJECT,
HE SERVED YOU

190
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,791
AND LOVED YOU.

191
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,291
( sobbing )

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,791
- ( birds chirping )

193
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,000
- Milk: AH-HA!

194
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,708
- OUR TIP WAS RELIABLE.
THEY SAID WE'D FIND THEM HERE.

195
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,625
- ( thinking) RYNER,
YOU HAVE FALLEN UNDER

196
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,958
THE TREACHEROUS SPELL
OF THIS PERNICIOUS SIREN

197
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,958
WHO EXPLOITS YOUR WEAKNESS
FOR EVIL DEEDS.

198
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:50,291
I AM YOUR ONLY HOPE.
I MUST SAVE YOU.

199
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,333
- ( Ferris screams )

200
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,125
- MY LOVE!

201
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,875
( exclaims and laughs )

202
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,125
AAH!

203
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,166
- Luke: EXCUSE ME, CAPTAIN.

204
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,791
- HUH?

205
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:08,041
- WE NEED A PLAN.
- RIGHT. OF COURSE.

206
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,750
FIRST, I WILL CREATE
A DIVERSION WITH MAGIC.

207
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,875
- MOE, YOU BACK ME UP, OKAY?
- YES, MA'AM.

208
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,750
- LUKE, LACH, LEAR,
ATTACK WITH SWORDS.

209
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,791
FIRST, RENDER
THE TABOO-BREAKER USELESS,

210
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,125
THEN CAPTURE HIM.

211
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,916
- ROGER, CAPTAIN.

212
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,833
- NOW, COME ON, BOYS.

213
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,083
LET'S DO WHAT WE
CAME HERE TO DO.

214
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,125
- All: RIGHT!

215
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,500
- ( thinking ) RYNER,
I'LL RESCUE YOU, YOU'LL SEE!

216
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,458
WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER. IZUCHI!

217
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,750
- ( sighs )

218
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,208
- OH, NO! RALLY TO THE CAPTAIN!

219
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,083
- ( groans )

220
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,583
- ( sinister laughter )

221
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,208
- ( whimpers )

222
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,958
( Milk screams )

223
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,000
( moans )

224
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,541
- Ferris: YOU KNOW THIS GIRL?

225
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,000
THEN WHY IS SHE
SO DETERMINED TO DO YOU HARM?

226
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:17,791
- HMM?

227
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,291
HMM?

228
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,166
- OH, COME ON,
YOU STILL DON'T RECOGNIZE ME?

229
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,041
IT'S ME MILK, YOU'RE OLD FRIEND!

230
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,416
HOW CAN YOU NOT REMEMBER ME?

231
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,750
WE LIVE IN THE
SAME ORPHANAGE, YOU JERK!

232
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:27,833
- OH!

233
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,541
STILL NOTHING.

234
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,125
- AWW, YOU'RE SO MEAN.

235
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,458
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

236
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,708
I SUPPOSE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
YOU PROMISED TO MARRY ME

237
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,666
AND BE WITH ME
'TIL THE END OF TIME!

238
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,500
- DO WHAT?
- YOU PERVERT!

239
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,791
LURING STARRY-EYED YOUNG MAIDS

240
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,666
WITH VISIONS OF
STORYBOOK WEDDINGS!

241
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,291
- COME ON!

242
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,875
- NOW, EVEN IF YOU TWO
ARE BETROTHED,

243
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,041
ARE YOU TRULY CERTAIN
YOU'D WANT TO MARRY "HIM?"

244
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,958
- ( exclaims )

245
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,416
WELL, PROMISE OR NO,

246
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,500
WE WERE YOUNG AND FOOLISH THEN,
INFATUATED AND ENAMORED,

247
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,416
AND YET, IT SEEMS OUR FATES

248
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,791
ARE ENTWINED AS THE STARS
HAVE UNITED US ONCE AGAIN.

249
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,416
DON'T YOU AGREE?

250
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,750
- Ferris: JUST KNOW THE THE BOY
YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH,

251
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:08,916
IF EVER TRUE,

252
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,791
LONG AGO GAVE SWAY
TO HIS BASER NATURE.

253
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,166
- YES. BASER NATURE.

254
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,666
UH?

255
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,541
SHUT YOUR MOUTH! I DIDN'T ASK
FOR YOUR OPINION, HUSSY!

256
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,083
- I'M TRYING TO HELP.

257
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,958
IF YOU LIKE, I CAN CLEAVE
THE BONDS OF THIS FALSE LOVE,

258
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,125
BEGINNING OF COURSE
BY REMOVING ITS HEAD.

259
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:27,291
- NO, RYNER! MAKE A RUN FOR IT!
RUN AWAY WHILE YOU STILL CAN!

260
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,916
- GIMME A BREAK.

261
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,250
- WELL, I SUPPOSE THERE'S
MUCH WORK TO BE DONE.

262
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,666
BESIDES, IT WILL BE DARK SOON.

263
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,500
- HEY, HOLD ON JUST A MINUTE!
YOU CAN'T GO!

264
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,250
RYNER! RYNER!

265
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,291
- ( groaning )

266
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,666
OKAY, IF THEY WERE REALLY
UNDER THE ORDERS FROM SION,

267
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,791
THEN WHY IN THE WORLD
WERE THEY COMING AFTER ME, HUH?

268
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,291
- OUR QUEST FOR RELICS
IS TOO IMPORTANT.

269
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,041
IT'S LIKELY THE KING
HAS NOT MADE IT PUBLIC.

270
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,166
- YEAH, WELL, EVEN SO. UH?

271
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,041
THE SWORD!

272
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,416
IT'S NO USE.

273
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,416
THE ALPHA STIGMA
CAN'T MAKE ANY SENSE OF IT.

274
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,041
IT'S CLEAR THIS THING'S
GOT SOME SERIOUS

275
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,375
OLD-WORLD MAGIC
GOING ON, BUT...

276
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,958
- ( birds chirping )

277
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,583
- ( grunting )

278
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,416
- Luke: THAT'S IT! DON'T GIVE
UP! HANG IN THERE, LACH.

279
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,958
- UM? ( exclaims )

280
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,750
- Lear: HEY, LOOK! MUST BE
A NELPHA ARMY PATROL GARRISON!

281
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,541
WE SHOULD CALL OUT TO THEM,
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP.

282
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,791
- THAT'S TRUE.

283
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,416
NELPHA HAS GRANTED US PERMISSION

284
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,375
TO TRAVEL THESE LANDS IN
OUR PURSUIT OF TABOO-BREAKERS.

285
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,166
BUT IF WE HAVE TO SPEND TIME
VERIFYING OUR IDENTITIES,

286
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,958
THE TABOO-BREAKER WILL GET AWAY.

287
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,750
- (thinking) THIS IS BAD!
REALLY BAD!

288
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,958
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY AFTER RYNER!

289
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,916
I MUST PROTECT HIM!

290
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,625
- SORRY, CAPTAIN,
BUT PROTECT WHO?

291
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,875
- ( thinking ) RYNER, MY LOVE.

292
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,750
IT'S MY TURN TO SAVE YOU NOW.

293
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,291
THERE'S NOTHING I WON'T DO.

294
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,333
( shouts ) I HAVE TO PEE!

295
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,625
- ( all exclaim )

296
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,958
- HELP ME! TYING UP A POOR,
INNOCENT MAIDEN,

297
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,833
HAVE YOU PEOPLE NO SHAME?

298
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,416
IF ONLY THERE WAS SOMEBODY
OUT THERE WHO COULD HELP!

299
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,125
- Soldier: THEY'RE OVER THERE!

300
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,291
- ( soldiers shouting )

301
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,291
- ( all exclaim )

302
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,083
- WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS?

303
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,958
THERE'S NO MISTAKING,
THAT WAS ROLAND MAGIC!

304
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,041
ON YOUR GUARD, MEN!

305
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,291
- ( inaudible )

306
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,041
- Luke: ANTE!

307
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,000
A SPELL THAT PREVENTS
SOUND TRANSMISSIONS.

308
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,041
IT'S SIMPLE IN THEORY,

309
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,416
BUT EXCEEDINGLY
DIFFICULT TO MASTER.

310
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,250
VERY DISORIENTING
ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

311
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,500
- ( pulsating )

312
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,083
- ANYONE HAVE A CLUE
WHAT THAT WAS?

313
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,916
- ( grunting )

314
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,291
- ( soldiers groaning )

315
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,541
- FOR NELPHA AND HIS MAJESTY!

316
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,916
- ( grunting )

317
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,041
- ( exclaims )

318
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,750
- NICE FALL. YOU OKAY?

319
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,291
- RYNER?

320
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,500
RYNER, YOU BIG FOOL! WHY DID YOU
COME BACK HERE AND SAVE ME, HUH?

321
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,083
THIS TIME, I WAS SUPPOSED TO
RESCUE YOU, YOU...

322
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,208
- FOR A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS,

323
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,916
YOU SURE ARE MOODY,
YOU KNOW THAT?

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,750
- Luke: CAPTAIN,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

325
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:36,875
- RYNER!

326
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,750
THOUGH I'M A CONFIDENT WARRIOR,

327
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,250
TO PROTECT THESE MEN
AND THE GIRL YOU ABANDONED,

328
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,708
I'LL NEED BACK-UP!

329
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,458
WE'RE OUTNUMBERED HERE!

330
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,666
- I DIDN'T ABANDON HER!

331
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,041
- NEED I REMIND YOU
YOU'RE HOLDING A HERO RELIC?

332
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,916
BE A MAN AND DO SOMETHING!

333
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,208
- HUH?

334
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,833
- COME ON NOW, ARE YOU
A HERO OR AREN'T YOU?

335
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,250
- CAN'T A GUY JUST TAKE
A NAP AROUND HERE?

336
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,708
FOR THE RECORD, I DON'T EXACTLY
KNOW HOW TO USE THIS THING.

337
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,166
- Ferris: FIGURE IT OUT!
- OH, FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD.

338
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,708
- ( swords clanging )

339
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,791
- Ryner: YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD BE AWESOME?

340
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,958
INSTRUCTIONS.

341
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,833
- ( grunting )

342
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,000
- IT'S POINTLESS,
I DON'T SEE A THING!

343
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,958
- ( grunting )

344
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,375
- COME ON!
- I'M TRYING MY BEST HERE.

345
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,666
DECIPHERING A RELIC ISN'T
A CHILD'S PLAY, YOU KNOW?

346
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,708
OH, FORGET IT!

347
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:21,875
- ( dramatic music )

348
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,708
- ( all exclaim )

349
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:36,250
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- RYNER, WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?

350
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,541
- I DON'T KNOW.

351
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,333
- ( all exclaim )

352
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,750
- ( roaring )

353
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,500
- RETREAT, NOW!

354
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,916
- ( soldiers clamoring )

355
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,166
- (roaring )

356
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,625
- Ferris: IMPRESSIVE.

357
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,750
YEAH, THAT'S NOT
A LEGENDARY HERO, IS IT?

358
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,916
- NO. THAT'S DEFINITELY
A DRAGON.

359
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,291
-WHATEVER IT MAY BE,

360
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,708
PERHAPS WE SHOULD WITHDRAW
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE?

361
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,625
- PROBABLY SO.

362
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:20,666
- LET'S GO.

363
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,916
- UGH! WAIT!

364
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,500
SO YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO WALK AWAY! YOU WOKE IT UP!

365
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,541
LEAST YOU COULD DO
IS KILL THE THING!

366
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,625
I MEAN IT'S ONLY GOOD MANNERS!

367
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,375
- ( roaring )

368
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:44,666
- Milk: I'M DONE.

369
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,291
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

370
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,125
I DON'T DESERVE TO BE
CALLED YOUR CAPTAIN.

371
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,583
- ( all exclaim )

372
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:54,666
- ( thinking ) MY FRIENDS,
I FAILED... I FAILED YOU.

373
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,333
I MADE A VOW
THAT I WOULD SAVE RYNER.

374
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,916
THAT I WOULD STOP AT NOTHING

375
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,125
TO SEE MY
SECRET PURPOSE THROUGH.

376
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,833
EVEN IF IT MEANT
I WOULD BETRAY MY FRIENDS,

377
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,791
WHOM I CARE ABOUT SO DEEPLY.

378
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,375
- Luke: CAPTAIN MILK, THERE IS
NO REASON FOR YOU TO CRY.

379
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,458
DON'T YOU REMEMBER IT?

380
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,375
THE DAY HIS MAJESTY
GAVE US OUR CHARGE?

381
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,500
- Milk: MY NOBLE LORD.

382
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,125
FOR THE GLORY OF YOUR MAJESTY,

383
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,750
I ACCEPT THIS QUEST
TO SEEK OUT TABOO-BREAKERS.

384
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,333
- Sion: FORTUNE BE WITH YOU.

385
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,208
AND WHEN THOUGHTS OF SLAYING
YOUR FORMER BRETHREN AIL YOU

386
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,791
MAY THOUGHTS OF JUSTICE
SPUR YOU ON.

387
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,958
KNOW THIS, THE ETERNAL
THANKS OF YOUR KING

388
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,250
GOES WITH YOU
ON YOUR QUEST.

389
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,291
- AND WE, YOUR SQUIRES,
ARE GRATEFUL FOR IT.

390
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:46,666
MY LORD, I GLADLY ACCEPT
WHATEVER MAY BEFALL US.

391
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,208
I GAVE UP ONCE. I TURNED MY BACK
ON THE IDEA OF HOPE.

392
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,750
I SOUGHT TO CLOSE MY EYES
TO THE TROUBLES OF THE WORLD

393
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,458
AND SLEEP IN APATHY.

394
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,875
BUT THEN, A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE
FROM CHILDHOOD

395
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,875
GAVE ME THE STRENGTH
TO CARRY ON WITH MY LIFE.

396
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,916
SO, YOU SEE, I OWE HIM

397
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,958
FOR GIVING ME THE COURAGE
TO VENTURE FORWARD.

398
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,583
I LONG TO PROTECT ROLAND,

399
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,958
BECAUSE THIS IS THE LAND
WHERE I FIRST MET HIM.

400
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,750
I WON'T FAIL YOU.

401
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,291
I SWEAR IT.

402
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,041
I GLADLY ACCEPT THE MISSION
WITH PRIDE, MY LEIGE.

403
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,583
- Luke: BACK THEN,
WE MADE A DECISION.

404
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,416
WE VOWED TO BELIEVE IN YOU,
NO MATTER THE COST.

405
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,541
SO, TRUST ME, CAPTAIN,

406
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,458
YOU'RE SQUADRON WILL
NEVER LOSE FAITH IN YOU.

407
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,541
AND WE'RE WITH YOU TILL THE END.

408
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,416
SO WHAT IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE?

409
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,000
WE'LL FIX IT.
WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.

410
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,833
WHATEVER BEFALLS US,
WE'LL BE HERE BY YOUR SIDE.

411
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,958
YOU'RE OUR CAPTAIN
AND WE NEED YOU.

412
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,583
SO, ON YOUR FEET.
WE NEED FOOD.

413
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,708
A GOOD BRACING MEAL
IS CALLED FOR.

414
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,125
AFTER ALL, WHAT ELSE
ARE FAMILIES FOR?

415
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:07,958
- FAMILIES?

416
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,541
( laughs )

417
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,250
ALL RIGHT.

418
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,500
- Sion: FIOLE WAS MURDERED

419
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,875
BECAUSE I WASN'T STRONG
ENOUGH TO PROTECT HIM.

420
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:26,625
THE ENTIRETY OF THE BLAME
FALLS AT MY FEET.

421
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,208
- DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF
WITH SUCH THOUGHTS.

422
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,708
THINK INSTEAD OF THE HAPPINESS
YOUR GRACE BROUGHT HIM.

423
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,208
FROM THE MOMENT HE MET YOU,

424
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,125
HE COULD SCARCE TALK ABOUT
ANYTHING ELSE, YOUR LORDSHIP.

425
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,000
FIOLE LOVED YOU.

426
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,416
THAT IS WHY I WISH

427
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,458
TO REPAY YOUR MAJESTY
FOR THE BLESSINGS YOU GAVE HIM.

428
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:50,541
- Sion: MY CHILD, YOU WISH
TO BE IN MY SERVICE?

429
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,583
- I DO.

430
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,083
- ( footsteps approaching )

431
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,416
- Miran: MY LORD, I BRING
TROUBLING NEWS

432
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,083
REGARDING THE
PROVINCE OF ESTABUL.

433
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,833
THE NOBLES HAVE DECLARED REVOLT.

434
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,958
- ( theme song playing )

435
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,875
- Ryner: YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK SUCKS?

436
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,250
REVOLTS.

437
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:44,125
HELL, FOR THAT MATTER
NATIONS AND POLITICS, TOO.

438
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,708
SION, YOU GOTTA QUIT
BEATING YOURSELF UP

439
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,208
OVER EVERY
STUPID LITTLE DETAIL

440
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,791
AND JUST TELL THOSE GREEDY
NOBLES, "HEY, YOU GUYS SUCK!"

441
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,458
OH, MAN. THIS SUCKS.
