1
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:25,208
- Keifer: AND IT CAME TO PASS
WHEN DESPITE HIS BITTER RESOLVE

2
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,791
THE BLACK HERO, WHO'D
TIRELESSLY PITTED HIMSELF

3
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,791
AGAINST THE WORLD'S
FILTH AND CORRUPTION

4
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,875
BUCKLED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF
HIS BURDEN, AND WAS SUBDUED.

5
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,333
- ( screams )

6
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,625
- Keifer:
BOUND INEXTRICABLY TO

7
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,333
THE DARKEST REGIONS
OF THE SOUTH,

8
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,416
SEALED THERE BY THE MAGIC OF
THE WORLD'S PROTECTOR GODDESS,

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,875
THE BLACK HERO LANGUISHED.

10
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,708
BUT A MONSTER NOT
UNLIKE HIMSELF

11
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,958
DWELLED IN THE FORGOTTEN
CORNERS OF THAT PRISON.

12
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,458
THE LONESOME DEVIL.

13
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:02,083
FOREVER ISOLATED FROM THE
SYMPATHY OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES

14
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,041
BY A POWER TOO
HIDEOUS TO FATHOM,

15
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,291
WANDERING THROUGH
A LIFE OF SOLITUDE AND REGRET.

16
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,291
- Sion: I WOULD BREAK
FREE OF THIS SEAL,

17
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,458
BUT LACK THE POWER TO DO SO.

18
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,791
I THROW MYSELF AT YOUR MERCY.

19
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,416
LET ME CONSUME
HALF OF YOUR BODY

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,416
THAT ITS STRENGTH
MAY RELEASE ME.

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
- Ryner: BECAUSE YOU ASK
AS ONE IN DIRE NEED,

22
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,708
I GIVE OF MYSELF FREELY.

23
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,666
I OFFER THIS BODY FOR
THE HONOR OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

24
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,583
THE FIRST I'VE EVER KNOWN.

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,250
- Keifer: PLEDGING HALF
OF HIS PHYSICAL FORM

26
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,958
TO THE BLACK HERO'S RELEASE,
THE DEMON KNOWN AS

27
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,916
ALL FORMULAS RENT ITSELF
INTO TWO DISTINCT ENTITIES

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,041
THE WEAVER OF ALL FORMULAS,
AND THE SOLVER OF ALL FORMULAS.

29
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:49,041
THE BLACK HERO GREEDILY DEVOURED
THE WEAVER AT ONCE,

30
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:52,833
AND ASSUMED THE INESTIMABLE
POWER CONTAINED THEREIN.

31
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,666
- ( theme song playing )

32
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,541
- Keifer: REINVIGORATED,
THE BLACK HERO RUTHLESSLY

33
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,791
GROUND AWAY AT THE WORLD

34
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,041
UNTIL IT WAS WORN DOWN
TO AN IRREDUCIBLE CORE.

35
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,750
AND THERE,
AT THE HEART OF THINGS,

36
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,666
DESPITE HIS NEWFOUND POWER,

37
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,708
HE DROWNED IN DESPAIR,
LONELINESS, PAIN,

38
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,375
ENDLESS NIGHT AND
THE WORST KIND OF HELL.

39
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,625
- Sion: I CAN'T BARE IT!

40
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,333
( screams )

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,583
HELP ME! I BEG OF YOU!

42
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,666
I WOULD DESTROY THE WORLD
TO SHED THIS AGONY.

43
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,750
I IMPLORE SOMEONE, ANYONE,
TO ASSUME THIS PAIN,

44
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:36,208
THIS UNYIELDING DARKNESS,
IN MY STEAD.

45
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,000
- Ryner: THEN I GIVE TO YOU
THE REMAINING HALF OF MY BODY.

46
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,791
THERE IS ROOM ENOUGH
HERE FOR NIGHT.

47
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,958
- Keifer: THE LONESOME DEVIL
HELD NO REGRET

48
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,375
FOR HIS RECKLESS VOW,
THOUGH THE COST WAS UNTHINKABLE.

49
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,916
BECAUSE IN HIS SACRIFICE,
IF ONLY FOR A MOMENT,

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,583
THE TINIEST SPARK OF SOMETHING
HE'D NEVER KNOWN FLICKERED.

51
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,000
TRUST.

52
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:11,083
MANY A WISE MAN MAINTAINS THAT
THE LONESOME DEVIL WAS A FOOL.

53
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,208
- ( exclaims )

54
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:22,500
- Keifer: IF THAT BE TRUE,
LITTLE HAS CHANGED.

55
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,750
- Claugh: IT'S NOT LIKE SION
TO BE OUT THIS LATE.

56
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,291
ESPECIALLY IF HE'S
GONE TO THE TROUBLE

57
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,416
OF DRAGGING THE TWO OF US IN.

58
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:34,125
- FIELD MARSHAL.
- WHAT IS IT, CALNE?

59
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,833
- I THINK I'VE GOT
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA

60
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,083
OF WHY HE CALLED US HERE.

61
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,666
JUST TAKE A LOOK
AT WHAT HE LEFT.

62
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,500
- ( thunder rumbling )

63
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,958
- GIVE ME A BREAK.
ARE YOU REALLY CRYING?

64
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,166
- I AM NOT!

65
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,083
- OH YEAH? IT SURE
LOOKS THAT WAY.

66
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,916
- TRUST ME, IT'S THE RAIN.

67
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,250
- ( sighs )

68
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,958
SO, WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU INTEND
TO DO WITH ME NOW? SERIOUSLY.

69
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:05,916
WELL ALL RIGHT.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I FIGURED WE'D END UP LIKE
THIS ONE OF THESE DAYS.

71
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,708
SO IT'S NO BIG SURPRISE.

72
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,958
THAT'S KINDA HOW
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN, YOU KNOW?

73
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,916
WHEN THINGS GO WELL
I CAN'T LET 'EM BE.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,625
I'M ALWAYS WAITING
FOR THE OTHER SHOE TO DROP.

75
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,041
IT GETS WORSE THE HAPPIER I GET.

76
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,333
BUT IT IS BACKED UP
BY EXPERIENCE.

77
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,208
SO, SION, OLD BUDDY...

78
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,541
YOU'RE, UH...
BENT ON KILLING ME, HUH?

79
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,750
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME.
I HAVE TO.

80
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,125
- IT'S OKAY. I UNDERSTAND.

81
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,666
AT LEAST IT'S YOU, RIGHT?

82
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,458
I CAN IMAGINE WORSE
PEOPLE FOR THE JOB.

83
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,708
STILL, THOUGH,
I'VE GOTTA PASS.

84
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,291
BECAUSE I CARE
ABOUT YOU TOO MUCH

85
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,750
TO LET YOU GO THROUGH WITH IT.

86
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,500
I MEAN, C'MON.
IT'S A FOOL'S ERRAND ANYWAY.

87
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,041
STILL LOTS OF MONSTERS
LIKE ME OUT THERE.

88
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,833
THAT, AND I PROMISED THIS
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

89
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,500
I'VE ALREADY DECIDED
WHO GETS TO KILL ME.

90
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,750
- FERRIS?
- YEAH.

91
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:16,333
- I HAVE TO ADMIT, I'M JEALOUS.
BUT I HAVE NO ROOM TO COMPLAIN.

92
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,541
IT'S NOT AS THOUGH I HONORED
MY PROMISE TO YOU, NOW IS IT?

93
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,166
- YOU HAVE A POINT. EVEN SO,

94
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,250
I STILL CONSIDER YOU ONE OF
THE BEST FRIENDS I'VE EVER HAD.

95
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,375
- AND I, YOU.

96
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,916
- YOU STILL GONNA
GO THROUGH WITH IT?

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,458
- YES.

98
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,375
- YOUR MIND'S MADE UP THEN?
- IT IS.

99
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,083
- AND I CAN'T
PERSUADE YOU OTHERWISE?

100
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,958
- I'M AFRAID NOT, RYNER.

101
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:38,041
THIS ENDS TONIGHT. FOR GOOD.

102
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:41,000
- WELL I GOT NEWS FOR YOU,
SION. IT'S NOT OVER.

103
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,375
YOU CAN'T WIN AGAINST ME.

104
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,833
- ( rumbling )

105
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,125
- Sion: WE'LL SEE. NOW!

106
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,958
- ( groans )

107
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,000
WHAT I SEEK...

108
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,125
IS THUNDER! IZUCHI!

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,291
THE HELL IS THIS? NO! TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T RESORT TO THIS!

110
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,791
- SORRY.

111
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,958
I'VE DONE WHAT
NECESSITY REQUIRED OF ME.

112
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,625
- YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND!

113
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,625
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS'LL DO OUR THE COUNTRY!

114
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,541
- DON'T PATRONIZE ME.
I'M PAINFULLY AWARE.

115
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,708
THESE DAYS, IT SEEMS
EXTREME MEASURES ARE CALLED FOR.

116
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:40,000
- BULLSHIT! YOU CARRIED OUT
EXPERIMENTS ON INNOCENT PEOPLE!

117
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,291
THERE'S NO EXCUSE!

118
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,500
YOU LET YOUR BURDEN
TURN YOU INTO A MONSTER!

119
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,333
YOU ARROGANT SON OF A BITCH!

120
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,166
WHY WOULDN'T YOU
LET US HELP YOU?

121
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,541
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
TAKE IT ALL ON YOURSELF!

122
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,208
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
BE A PART OF THIS!

123
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,500
WHY THE HELL COULDN'T YOU
LET ANY OF US IN?

124
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,250
GODDAMMIT, SION, YOU KNEW
WE WERE THERE FOR YOU!

125
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:02,000
WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER! IZUCHI!

126
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,333
IZUCHI!

127
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,375
( yells )

128
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,958
( groans )

129
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,583
DAMN YOU, SION!
I REFUSE TO LET YOU DO THIS!

130
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,583
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH
SENSE IT MAKES TO YOU

131
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,041
IN THE STATE YOU'RE IN!

132
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,500
I DON'T CARE HOW HARD IT IS
FOR YOU TO SEE THE TRUTH!

133
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,333
HOW EASY IT IS FOR YOU TO CAVE
UNDER THE HOPELESSNESS!

134
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,958
IF YOU THINK I'M GOING
TO GIVE UP ON YOU,

135
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,041
YOU'RE IN FOR A RUDE AWAKENING!

136
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,166
- YOU'LL DIE.
BY MY HAND. TONIGHT.

137
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,666
- THE HELL I WILL.

138
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,041
- BY MY HAND...

139
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,208
- YOU WON'T KILL
YOUR BEST FRIEND!

140
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,708
SNAP THE HELL
OUT OF IT ALREADY.

141
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,625
SION!

142
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,291
- BY MY HAND. NO ONE ELSE'S.

143
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,875
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

144
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,833
I KNOW DAMN WELL YOU'RE CRYING,
YOU CAN'T BLAME IT ON THE RAIN.

145
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,541
I WON'T LET YOU DO THIS.

146
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,416
- RYNER...
I APPRECIATE IT.

147
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,500
BUT I'M DOING THIS FOR YOUR SAKE
FIRST AND FOREMOST, KNOW THAT.

148
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,250
REGARDLESS OF WHAT
BECOMES OF THE WORLD,

149
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,000
I HAVE TO SAVE YOU.

150
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,041
- ( grunting )

151
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,291
WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER!

152
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,000
- ( grunting )

153
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,083
- IZUCHI!

154
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,958
- ( both yelling )

155
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,916
- ( whooshing )

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,208
- ( groans )

157
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,166
SION, PLEASE!

158
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,958
- THERE YOU ARE.

159
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,708
I'VE MISSED YOU,
MY DEAR, LONESOME DEVIL.

160
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:56,333
I'M IN YOUR DEBT FOR
WRENCHING ME FREE OF THE SEAL.

161
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,458
- SION!

162
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,708
( groans )

163
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,458
- THIS ISN'T YOU.
- THE TIME HAS COME, HASN'T IT?

164
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,541
I MUST CONSUME YOU. I MUST.

165
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,875
THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOU
TO WANDER FOR ETERNITY

166
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,208
THROUGH THE HELL
OF YOUR OWN MIND.

167
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,416
I MUST CONDEMN YOU TO THAT.

168
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,625
IF ONLY THERE WERE
ANOTHER WAY...

169
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,166
BUT COME NOW,
LET US FEAST.

170
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,833
THE WORLD AWAITS ITS SALVATION.

171
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,083
- I IMPLORE YOU TO STOP,
ANCIENT ONE.

172
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,625
THE TIME IS NOT YET RIPE
FOR WHAT YOU WOULD ACHIEVE.

173
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,458
- WHO ARE YOU? THE ALPHA?
NO, YOU CANNOT BE.

174
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:42,208
HINDER ME NOT, THEN.
I WOULD FEAST.

175
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,708
- I SAY AGAIN.
THE TIME IS NOT RIPE.

176
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,666
IF YOU COULD LOOK PAST
YOUR OWN DESIRE

177
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,541
SUCH WOULD BE PLAIN,
YE WEAVER OF ALL FORMULAS.

178
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,041
- INTERESTING. I DIDN'T
EXPECT YOU TO BREAK THROUGH.

179
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,208
I UNDERESTIMATED YOUR
EASE OF MOVEMENT ON THIS PLANE.

180
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,250
- PLEASE, PERSUADE HIM TO STOP.

181
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,166
PERSUADE HIM TO
RELEASE RYNER LUTE.

182
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,583
- I FEAR HIS HEART IS
RATHER SET ON HIS MEAL.

183
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,500
- PERHAPS. BUT IT IS
NOT YET THE HOUR.

184
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,333
HIS ROLE IS CRITICAL
AND IN HIS CURRENT STATE

185
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,625
THE WORLD WOULD BENEFIT NOTHING.

186
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,791
NO ONE'S SALVATION
WOULD BE SECURED.

187
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,458
NOT HIS. NOR YOURS.

188
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,250
NOR THE GIRL YOU
CARE SO MUCH FOR.

189
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,208
NO ONE.

190
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,583
- YOU HAVE A POINT.
SAGELY SPOKEN, MY LADY.

191
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,791
- THEN, YOU AGREE.

192
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,666
IT PLEASES ME TO KNOW
THAT YOU ARE STILL

193
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,500
POSSESSED OF SOME
SHRED OF REASON.

194
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:33,041
- MY REASON? IS IT REALLY YOUR
PLACE TO JUDGE SUCH A THING?

195
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,541
TRUTH BE TOLD, MY LADY,

196
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:38,166
IT WOULD PLEASE ME TO KNOW
THAT SOME SHRED REMAINED IN YOU.

197
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,708
THOUGH SION'S REASON IS HARDY,

198
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,333
IT DOESN'T STOOP TO BE
WHITTLED AWAY

199
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,916
BY SUCH HAPPENSTANCE.

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,958
THAT IS WHY I CHOOSE TO TARRY
BY HIS SIDE WHILE HE RULES.

201
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:50,333
THE ROAD RISES TO MEET HIM
AND HIS TREAD UPON IT IS TRUE.

202
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,833
( scoffs )

203
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:55,000
AND ALL ROADS LEAD TO HIS
BETRAYAL OF YOU, RYNER LUTE.

204
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,875
UNTHINKABLE MONSTER.
LONESOME DEVIL.

205
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,041
- ( gasps )

206
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,458
- BUT BY ALL MEANS,

207
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,375
UNTIL HIS PERFIDY CARVE ITSELF
IN STONE, PLAY THE ALLY,

208
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,583
DROWN HIS CONSCIENCE
IN THE LUKEWARM TIDE

209
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,208
OF YOUR IDEAS OF RIGHT.

210
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,958
REMAIN IGNORANT OF HIS PAIN,

211
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,416
AND SLEEP THE CHILDISH
IDLE OF THE NAIVE.

212
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,333
- Ryner: SION.

213
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:28,666
HEY. HEY, C'MON. WAKE UP.
I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME.

214
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,625
DON'T JUST SIT THERE
IN A DAZE. GET UP.

215
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,333
- WAIT, WHAT...
WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON?

216
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,916
- IT'S MORNING.
JUST SHAKE IT OFF ALREADY.

217
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,125
YOU'RE LUCKY I DIDN'T DUMP
COLD WATER ON YOU.

218
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,750
LEAVING ME TO SHOVEL
THROUGH ALL THIS CRAP

219
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,291
WHILE YOU GO SKIPPING
OFF TO DREAMLAND.

220
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,000
- UH, RIGHT.

221
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,416
HOW, UH, HOW LONG WAS I ASLEEP?
BE HONEST WITH ME.

222
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,416
- FOUR HOURS.
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

223
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,833
- NOPE.

224
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,375
- SO, THEN. IT WAS ALL
JUST A HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE.

225
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,583
- AH, IT WAS A BAD ONE, HUH?

226
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,708
- WELL, NOT THE WHOLE THING.
THERE WAS THIS...

227
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,375
NO, WAIT.
MAYBE THERE WASN'T.

228
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,333
- YOU DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER, DO YOU?

229
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,458
- I HAD A VIVID IMAGE
TILL A MOMENT AGO.

230
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,208
IT'S STARTING TO SLIP
AWAY FROM ME NOW,

231
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,541
BUT I DO REMEMBER THAT
IT WAS VERY UNPLEASANT.

232
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,916
- WELL THEN, I GUESS IT WAS
A GOOD THING I WOKE YOU UP

233
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,166
WHEN I DID, RIGHT?

234
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,166
- YES IT WAS. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH. YOU SAVED ME.

235
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,208
- YEAH, WELL.
IT DIDN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD.

236
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,083
"OH WOW! JACKPOT! I'M
SURROUNDED BY BEAUTIFUL GIRLS

237
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,000
WHO'RE ITCHING TO
FULFILL MY EVERY WHIM!"

238
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,666
I FIGURED I'D LET YOU SLEEP.

239
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,666
WAKE ME UP FROM THE KINDA DREAM
I THOUGHT YOU WERE HAVING,

240
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,791
I'LL KICK YOUR BUTT.

241
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,083
- OH DEAR, MY SECRET
COMES OUT AT LAST.

242
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,958
- AH, DAMN IT!
DON'T GO ALONG WITH IT

243
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,333
WHEN I'M GIVING YOU GRIEF.

244
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,166
IT'S A HELLUVA LOT MORE FUN
WHEN YOU PUT UP A FIGHT.

245
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,625
- ( chuckles )

246
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,125
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE PUT OUR NOSES
BACK TO THE GRINDSTONE?

247
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,541
- YOU AND YOUR WORK ETHIC.

248
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:48,916
ANYWAY, WHAT GRINDSTONE?

249
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,791
THE CRAP'S ALL BEEN SHOVELED
IF YOU HADN'T NOTICED.

250
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:51,833
- HUH?

251
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,666
- RYNER, YOU... YOU DIDN'T
DO THIS YOURSELF?

252
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,250
- I DID.

253
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,958
- SO YOU, YOU TOOK ON THE WHOLE
PILE WITHOUT TRYING TO WAKE ME?

254
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:01,958
- GIVE ME A BREAK.

255
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,458
I'M NOT A SAINT.

256
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:07,125
I TRIED TO WAKE YOU UP AND YOU
WOULDN'T, SO, YOU KNOW...

257
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,750
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH, YEAH.

258
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,375
- NO, RYNER. THANK YOU.

259
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,291
- AW, GIVE IT A
REST ALREADY, HUH?

260
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,916
- SPEAKING OF, GO LIE
THE HELL DOWN!

261
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,291
- NO NEED FOR THAT ANYMORE.

262
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,083
LET'S GET A JUMP
ON THE NEXT BATCH.

263
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,041
- ( exclaims )

264
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,875
I HAVEN'T SLEPT
A FRIGGIN' WINK YET!

265
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,125
- ( laughs )

266
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:29,250
NO. OF COURSE NOT.
I KNEW THIS WASN'T REAL.

267
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,333
THE TIME HAS COME,
THERE'S NO DENYING IT.

268
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,125
I MUST SOLDIER ON, REGARDLESS.

269
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,000
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

270
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,375
- ( breathing heavily )

271
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,250
DAMN YOU.
GET ON WITH IT.

272
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,166
END HIS LIFE RIGHT HERE AND NOW.

273
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,583
OR DOOM YOUR FRIEND
TO WALK THE EARTH FOR ETERNITY.

274
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,250
DO IT OR HE'LL
NEVER BE ABLE TO DIE.

275
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,583
WOULD YOU HAVE HIM WANDER
HIS OWN PERSONAL HELL FOREVER?

276
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,416
SPARE HIM!

277
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,250
SPARE HIM FROM THE DARKNESS!
FROM HIMSELF!

278
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:11,750
DAMN YOU!

279
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,541
I CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO!

280
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,375
GLOAT IN YOUR TRIUMPH
IF YOU WILL, BUT I CAN'T.

281
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,708
- SILENCE.

282
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:24,083
TRIUMPH BECOMES NEITHER
OF US IN THIS TRAGIC TURN.

283
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,333
- ( laughs ) OF COURSE
IT DOESN'T.

284
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,250
YOU AND I ARE THE SAME.

285
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,333
- WE ARE.

286
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,500
- I AM...

287
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,166
WE ARE SO LAMENTABLY WEAK.

288
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,500
- WE ARE, YET STILL
WE SOLDIER ON.

289
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,041
- BY BETRAYING OUR LOVED ONES?

290
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:44,250
BY SACRIFICING A FRIEND
ON THE PYRE OF OUR OWN LACK?

291
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,500
PLUNGING HIM INTO HELL
SO WE MAY INCH FORWARD?

292
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,750
- WE DO.

293
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,000
- IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE!
- IT IS.

294
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,208
- I CAN'T BEAR THIS.
- YOU CAN'T.

295
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,250
- AND YET, WE SOLDIER ON,

296
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,541
DESPITE MY INABILITY
TO KILL RYNER

297
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,541
OR AT THE VERY LEAST
GIVE HIM HIS FREEDOM.

298
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,375
- YOU ACTED ACCORDING
TO OUR NATURE.

299
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,583
- STOP PATRONIZING ME.

300
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,125
- STOP SHOULDERING THE BLAME.

301
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,333
THE CHOICE BEFORE YOU
WAS NO CHOICE...

302
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,750
- YOU KNOW NOTHING! NOTHING!

303
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,375
YOU RATIONALIZE OUR WEAKNESS!

304
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,333
- I WOULD DISAPPEAR
FROM THE WORLD.

305
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,208
- WOULD YOU?

306
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,916
- TAKE THIS BODY.

307
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I GIVE THE REIGNS TO YOU.
I AM DONE WITH THIS STRUGGLE.

308
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,750
- VERY WELL.
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,

309
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,958
NEVER AGAIN NEED YOU
AGONIZE OVER A CHOICE

310
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,541
AS YOU DID THIS NIGHT.

311
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,875
INDEED, NEVER NEED YOU
AGONIZE OVER ANYTHING.

312
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,583
- FARE THEE WELL, DOUBT.

313
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,625
WE TWIST ABOUT INTERMINABLY,

314
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,416
BUT IN THE END WE
ALWAYS SOLDIER ON.

315
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,666
FAREWELL.

316
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:19,958
- ( groans )

317
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,125
- STAY BACK! TARRY HERE
UNDER PAIN OF EXECUTION!

318
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,041
- ( both scream )

319
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,166
- AFTER ALL THAT HE STILL
COULDN'T GO THROUGH WITH IT.

320
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,083
SO MUCH FOR THE COURAGE
OF HIS CONVICTIONS.

321
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,583
HEY! WHOEVER'S RUNNIN'
THIS JOINT

322
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,541
I GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS
NEED ANSWERIN'.

323
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,208
HELLO?

324
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,125
- ( panting )

325
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,583
- OR, IF YOU'RE
LYING DOWN ON THE JOB,

326
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,333
I COULD JUST CHALLENGE
YOUR WORK ETHIC.

327
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,875
BECAUSE ON THAT SORE SUBJECT,

328
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,000
I LEARNED A THING OR
TWO FROM THE BEST.

329
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,583
I OFFER UP THIS CONTRACT...

330
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,833
- ( explosion )

331
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,333
- ( gasps )

332
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:13,333
( exclaims )

333
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,666
- FERRIS?

334
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,750
- DO YOU REALIZE WHAT HELL
YOU'VE PUT ME THROUGH?

335
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:21,375
WHATEVER I MIGHT'VE DONE,
TRUST ME, I'M IN THE DARK...

336
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:26,291
- WAIT, WHAT THE?
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

337
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,833
( sniffling ) I WAS TOLD...

338
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,250
THEY ALL TOLD ME
THAT YOU WERE GONE.

339
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:34,291
THAT YOU WERE REALLY
AND TRULY DEAD. BUT I...

340
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,666
I NEVER BELIEVED IT. NEVER.

341
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,000
NOT EVEN... NOT EVEN WHEN
SION TOLD ME. I COULDN'T.

342
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,083
( crying )

343
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,291
- SO YOU SAW
THE OLD SLAVE-DRIVER.

344
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,958
- HE'S NOT HIMSELF ANYMORE.

345
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:52,875
AFTER HE TOLD ME YOU
WERE DEAD, HE JUST SMILED.

346
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,375
BUT THE LOOK IN HIS EYES...

347
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,583
IT WAS AS IF HE WANTED TO CRY.

348
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,583
I SCREAMED AT HIM.
I CALLED HIM A LIAR.

349
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,458
THEN HE SAID HE'D KILLED YOU.

350
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,000
AND STILL ALL HE
COULD DO WAS SMILE.

351
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,291
THEN HE TOLD ME TO LEAVE.

352
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,791
TO NEVER ASSOCIATE
WITH HIM AGAIN.

353
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,333
HE'S MARCHING THE ARMY
INTO IMPERIAL NELPHA.

354
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,375
- ( exclaims )

355
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,708
- HE LEADS THE CAMPAIGN

356
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,666
WITH SOLDIERS BORN OF
FORBIDDEN TECHNIQUES.

357
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,625
THE PEOPLE OF NELPHA ARE
ALL BEING SLAUGHTERED

358
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,791
LIKE LIVESTOCK.

359
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,708
AND THE CITIZENS HERE
ARE CHEERING IT ON

360
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,125
LIKE HE'S THEIR SAVIOR.

361
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,708
LIKE HE'S POISED
TO RULE THE WORLD

362
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,458
AND TRANSFORM IT INTO
THEIR PERSONAL SANCTUARY.

363
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,041
IT'S HIDEOUS.

364
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:32,458
THEY'VE ALL LOST THEIR MINDS.
THE NOBLES. SION. EVERYONE.

365
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,375
- IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

366
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,250
LOOK AT ME,
I'M MAKING YOU A PROMISE.

367
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,041
NONE OF THAT'S
YOUR PROBLEM ANYMORE.

368
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,916
- ( soldiers screaming )

369
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,458
- Man: THREE CHEERS
FOR THE HERO KING!

370
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,458
- DON'T LET HIM GET AWAY!

371
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,208
- LET'S GET THE HELL
OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

372
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,083
- YEAH, BUT THEN WHAT?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

373
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,875
WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF
WHATEVER'S DRIVING HIM

374
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,416
TO ACT LIKE THIS AND
FIGURE OUT A WAY

375
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,000
TO KNOCK SOME SENSE BACK
INTO THAT THICK SKULL OF HIS

376
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,625
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

377
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,083
- Man 1: OVER THERE!
- Man 2: THAT'S HIM!

378
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,125
- HOLD IT!

379
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,125
- BEST OF LUCK TO YOU.

380
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,333
- LET'S MOVE!
- RIGHT!

381
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,750
- ( theme song playing )

382
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,791
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT, SION.

383
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,125
EVEN AFTER EVERYTHING
YOU'VE PUT ME THROUGH,

384
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,833
I'M GRATEFUL.

385
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,291
BEFORE WE MET,
I WAS DEAD INSIDE.

386
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,291
SHUFFLING AIMLESSLY THROUGH
A KIND OF WAKING NIGHTMARE.

387
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,458
I WAS A MONSTER. I DIDN'T
DARE LET PEOPLE IN

388
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,583
OR ALLOW MYSELF TO
GET CLOSE TO THEM.

389
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,208
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO
LET MYSELF LOVE THEM.

390
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:04,000
THERE WAS NO POINT GOING ON.
LIFE FOR ME WAS NO LIFE AT ALL.

391
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,250
BUT YOU SWOOPED IN AND
BROKE THROUGH THE BARRIERS.

392
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,083
YOU SAVED ME. AND FOR THAT,

393
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,750
EVEN THOUGH I PROBABLY
CAME OFF LOOKING ANYTHING BUT.

394
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,000
DEEP DOWN I WAS THANKFUL.

395
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,666
- WHAT I SEEK ARE
THE BURNING FIELDS! KURENAI!

396
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,666
- PINK TRESSES?

397
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,416
- YOU DON'T THINK?
- I DO.

398
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,583
- Ryner: I INTEND TO RETURN
THE FAVOR ONE DAY,

399
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,416
LIKE IT OR NOT.

400
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,625
SO... I MAY NOT HAVE THE
FIRST CLUE ABOUT THE KIND OF

401
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,625
EVIL CRAP YOU'VE GOTTEN
YOURSELF MIXED UP IN.

402
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:59,166
BUT I'M COMING FOR YOU ANYWAY.
I'M COMING TO SAVE YOU.

403
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,666
- ( chuckles )

404
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,708
SALLY...

405
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,375
FORTH!

406
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,291
- Ryner: I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
WHAT IT TAKES, EITHER.

407
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:17,291
OR HOW MUCH STRENGTH I'M GONNA
NEED TO FACE YOU AGAIN.

408
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,541
I'LL SUMMON EVERY OUNCE I'VE GOT
AND THEN SOME. FOR YOU.

409
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,416
SO MY ADVICE? BE READY
FOR THE DAY I FIND YOU.

410
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,250
'CAUSE YOU MIGHT THINK
YOU REGRET NOT FINISHING ME OFF

411
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,625
WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE,

412
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,291
BUT TRUST ME, NOT NEARLY
AS MUCH AS YOU'RE GOING TO.

413
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,458
AS ALONE AS YOU I KNOW
YOU WANT TO BE,

414
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,000
I REFUSE TO LET YOU BROOD.

415
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,541
I REFUSE TO LET YOU HEAP ALL
THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS ON YOURSELF

416
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,666
LIKE YOU'RE THE ONLY HUMAN
BEING WHO CAN HANDLE THEM.

417
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,416
I'M COMING FOR YOU, SION.

418
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,708
IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO,

419
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,583
I'LL MAKE YOU SEE BEYOND
A SHADOW OF A DOUBT

420
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,958
THAT I'M THE BEST DAMN FRIEND
YOU'VE EVER HAD.

421
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:50,125
- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO,
IS WANT TO BE A PART OF IT.

422
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:56,833
- Ryner: WE ALL HAVE TO
SOLDIER ON. IT'S WHAT WE DO.

423
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,750
AND MARK MY WORDS, SION...

424
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:02,000
I AM NEVER, EVER,
GIVING UP ON YOU.

425
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,416
PERIOD.

426
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,750
ALL RIGHT, THEN? SHALL WE?

427
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:12,833
- WE SHALL.

428
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,958
LEAD ON.
