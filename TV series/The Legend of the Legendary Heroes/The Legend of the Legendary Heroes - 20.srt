1
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,250
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,333
- I AM AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER

3
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:53,125
IN ROLAND'S ELITE
TABOO-BREAKER SQUAD.

4
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,250
SERGEANT LUKE STOKKART
AT YOUR SERVICE.

5
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,833
I'VE COME HERE TONIGHT
BY ORDER OF HIS MAJESTY.

6
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,666
HOW DO I PUT THIS?

7
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,208
I'VE COME TO KILL YOU,
RYNER LUTE.

8
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,458
- BEFORE WE DELVE INTO THAT,

9
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:11,166
PERMIT ME TO ASK A FAVOR
OF SOME IMPORT.

10
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,958
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU
TO ELIMINATE RYNER LUTE

11
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,791
AS PER THE LATELY PENNED
ROYAL EDICT.

12
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,708
- ( smirks )

13
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,958
- I MUST RESPECTFULLY DECLINE.

14
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,958
- LET THERE BE DARKNESS.

15
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,833
- ( wind blowing )

16
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:32,875
- ( gasps )

17
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,541
- ( choking )
IT CAN'T BE! NO!

18
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,500
WHAT IS THIS?

19
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,208
- ( smirks )

20
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,791
- TOUCH A SINGLE HAIR
ON MY CAPTAIN'S HEAD, DEAR SIR,

21
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,875
AND IT WILL BE
THE LAST THING YOU EVER DO.

22
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,291
IS THAT CLEAR?

23
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,333
OUR FAMILY DOES NOT SUFFER
MEDDLERS LIKE YOU GLADLY.

24
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,333
NOD ONCE IF YOU UNDERSTAND.

25
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,583
- WELL PLAYED, SIR.

26
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,166
I SHALL RELEASE
YOUR DEAR CAPTAIN AT ONCE,

27
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,208
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

28
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,625
DYING DOESN'T SUIT ME
AT THE MOMENT.

29
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,250
- UNTIL I AM ASSURED
OF HER SAFETY,

30
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,791
YOUR LIFE HANGS BY A THREAD.

31
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,083
- QUITE THE CAUTIOUS FELLOW,
I SEE.

32
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,375
IS THAT A SO-CALLED
HERO RELIC YOU WIELD?

33
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,666
- LET US SAY I STUMBLED
UPON SOMETHING

34
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,666
RYNER LUTE OVERLOOKED
IN HIS RESEARCH.

35
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,708
THE THREADS OF THIS
NEEDLE WEND THEIR WAY

36
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,375
TO THE REACHES OF INFINITY.

37
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:47,416
THREADS ONLY, PERHAPS,
BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEVER.

38
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,000
- THE MIND REELS AT THE DAMAGE
SUCH AN INNOCUOUS LOOKING WEAPON

39
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,125
COULD DO, IF, SAY, IT
WERE TO FALL INTO THE HANDS

40
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,750
OF ROLAND'S ENEMIES ABROAD.

41
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,041
- GASTARK? AM I RIGHT?

42
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:03,250
- AH. SOMEONE'S HAD THEIR EAR
AT A FEW DOORS, HAVEN'T THEY?

43
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,125
I PRESUME YOU'VE ALSO KEPT
A CLOSE WATCH ON RYNER.

44
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,458
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION OF HIM?

45
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,958
DO YOU THINK HIS EXISTENCE
IS NECESSARY TO US?

46
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,041
TO ROLAND AND HIS MAJESTY,
I MEAN.

47
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,958
IS HE VITAL TO THE KINGDOM'S
HEALTH, OR MORE OF A NUISANCE?

48
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,000
SURELY THIS WHOLE
IDYLLIC CONCEPT

49
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,708
OF A PEACEFUL, HARMONIOUS WORLD

50
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,250
WHERE NO ONE MEETS
A VIOLENT END

51
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,458
APPEALS TO YOU ON
A PERSONAL LEVEL AT LEAST?

52
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,625
BUT CAN NOT THE MORE
EXPERIENCED PART OF YOU

53
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,083
HELP BUT SEE IT AS A FANTASY?

54
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,666
- I'M AFRAID IT CAN'T.

55
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,250
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
CAMOUFLAGING THE EXTENT

56
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,291
OF YOUR MAGIC?

57
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,416
- YOU ARE A DESERTER,
RYNER LUTE!

58
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,458
AGAINST ALL PLEAS
FROM HIS MAJESTY,

59
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,250
YOU FLED FROM HIS FRIENDSHIP!

60
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,291
- AND NOW YOU'VE COME
TO CARRY OUT HIS ORDER!

61
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,958
- YOU'RE A KIND SOUL, I KNOW.

62
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,791
IT'S EASY TO SEE HOW CAPTAIN
MILK CAME TO BE SO FOND OF YOU.

63
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:58,541
IF YOU WERE TO PERISH,
SHE WOULD BE INCONSOLABLE.

64
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,833
BUT EVEN SO,

65
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:04,166
THE PATH BEFORE ME IS CLEAR.
YOU, SIR,

66
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,583
DO NOT BELONG AT HIS SIDE!

67
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,791
- Tiir: LAFRA.
LAFRA, WAKE UP.

68
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,458
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- WE HAVE AN INTRUDER

69
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,166
- TAKE MY WORD FOR IT,
THIS BATTLE IS ALL BUT DECIDED.

70
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,625
FIGHT ME AND DEATH'S ICY
GRIP WILL ONLY WRAP ITSELF

71
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,916
AROUND YOUR THROAT
ALL THE TIGHTER!

72
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:36,375
- TRAPS ON EITHER SIDE,
BUT A WEAK SPOT IN THE MIDDLE.

73
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,791
( grunts )

74
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,750
- YOU SAW THROUGH THEM.

75
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,000
- FOR FUTURE REFERENCE,
YOU TALK TOO MUCH!

76
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,666
- SO YOU BELIEVE.

77
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,791
WHAT THE HELL?

78
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,250
- CHECKMATE, MY FRIEND.

79
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,291
( grunts )

80
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,291
- WHY NOT JUST LET HIM DO IT?

81
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,500
HE'D BE DOING YOU AND
EVERYONE YOU KNOW A FAVOR.

82
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,958
YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE.

83
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,083
( groans )

84
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,125
AH, CRAP!

85
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,916
( screams )

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,333
- HMM? OH, I'M SORRY.

87
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,541
- DAMN YOU!
ONE OF THESE FRIGGIN' DAYS!

88
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,416
- HMM? YOU'LL WHAT?

89
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,666
I'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

90
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,000
WHATEVER THE HELL
YOUR PROBLEM IS...

91
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,375
- YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEAK UP.

92
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,708
- OKAY, YOU'VE GOT EVERY RIGHT
TO BE PISSED AT ME,

93
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,541
BUT CAN'T YOU JUST LET
ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU

94
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,625
WITH A PACK OF DANGO
OR SOMETHING?

95
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,750
- PERHAPS. BUT FIRST
YOU'LL TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

96
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,791
WHY IS THIS MAN
TRYING TO KILL YOU?

97
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,875
- UNBELIEVABLE! YOU'VE BEEN
TAILING ME, HAVEN'T YOU?

98
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,625
- WERE YOU AWARE OF MY PRESENCE?

99
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:54,958
- ( Pueka screams )

100
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,708
- ( explosion )

101
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,541
- ( children crying )

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,958
- Girl: BROTHER TIIR! NO!

103
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,791
- RUN. ALL OF YOU.
RUN AWAY.

104
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,583
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

105
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,666
- ( scoffs )

106
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,791
OH, C'MON.
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

107
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,625
THERE'S A FEAST FIT FOR
A KING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU

108
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,041
AND YOU JUST STAND
THERE AND BLEED?

109
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,625
THINK ABOUT IT, MAN.
HOW ELSE YOU GONNA KILL ME?

110
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,500
- WHAT THE...

111
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,666
- Lafra: RYNER!
- LAFRA?

112
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,125
- GASTARK HAS FOUND
OUR HIDING PLACE...

113
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,458
- ( all screaming )

114
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,166
- PUEKA!

115
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,458
- LAFRA.

116
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:56,791
- Lafra: PLEASE, RYNER,
YOU HAVE TO SAVE THEM.

117
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,416
- ( crying )

118
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,833
- ( laughing maniacally )

119
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,041
- OH GREAT! ANOTHER ONE.

120
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,916
- LIKE HELL!
NOT ON MY WATCH!

121
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,250
( screams )

122
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,791
- RYNER!

123
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,541
- Lir: LET THAT BE
A LESSOR, FREAK.

124
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,250
DON'T GET IN MY WAY

125
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,208
- ( laughing maniacally )

126
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,458
- ALL RIGHT, SPUNQUEL,
DO YOUR THING!

127
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,958
NOT A BAD START, HUH?

128
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,708
- ( children crying )

129
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,500
- ( laughs )

130
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,583
COME ON, YOU LITTLE FREAKS.

131
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,250
GET ON WITH IT AND LOSE
CONTROL ALREADY.

132
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,708
I DON'T HAVE ALL NIGHT.

133
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,416
- ( heart beats )

134
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,208
- Lafra: LOOK AT TIIR,
AND THE CHILDREN.

135
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,333
THINK ABOUT ALL OF OUR FRIENDS
SCATTERED TO THE FAR CORNERS

136
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,416
OF MENORIS.

137
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,041
MOST OF ALL, CONSIDER YOURSELF.

138
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,166
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHOSE GIFT FROM GOD

139
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,000
COST HIM HIS FAITH IN HUMANITY.

140
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,583
- GASTARK!

141
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,166
- WELL, WELL, PRETTY QUICK
ON THE DRAW, AREN'T YOU?

142
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,833
LIGHTNING BEASTS!

143
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,125
- ( yells )

144
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,083
- ( explosion )

145
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,583
- RYNER!

146
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,166
- YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

147
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,000
- ( shouts ) DAMN YOU!

148
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,333
- Lir: WHAT DID I JUST SAY
ABOUT GETTING IN MY WAY?

149
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,916
- WHAT I SEEK ARE
THE BURNING FIELDS! KURENAI!

150
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,166
- HEY.

151
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,250
LIGHTNING BEASTS.

152
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,208
- ( girl screams )

153
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,291
- UGH! DAMN IT ALL TO HELL!

154
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,583
I'VE KILLED ONE OF THE FREAKS

155
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,541
BEFORE IT WAS READY
TO BE CRYSTALLIZED!

156
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,875
FANTASTIC!

157
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,583
- HOLD ON!

158
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,125
- YOU SON OF A BITCH.

159
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,250
- RYNER! DAMN YOU! WAIT!
- ( yells )

160
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,500
- LIGHTNING BEASTS!

161
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,000
- WHAT I SEEK
IS THUNDER! IZUCH...

162
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,583
DAMMIT, FERRIS! WHAT THE
HELL'S WRONG WITH YOU

163
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,375
RUNNING OUT IN THE MIDDLE...

164
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,791
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

165
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:25,125
IDIOT! IF YOU'RE REALLY
SO OBSESSED WITH DYING ALONE,

166
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,250
JUST DO IT.

167
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,958
IF SEEING YOURSELF AS A MONSTER

168
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,541
TRUMPS SEEING YOURSELF
AS MY FRIEND,

169
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,000
THEN JUST VANISH
AND BE DONE WITH IT.

170
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,583
IF YOU REFUSE TO
SEE YOURSELF AS MY VALET,

171
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,500
MY TEA-DRINKING COMPANION,
OR MY ALLY,

172
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,000
I CANNOT CONVINCE YOU OTHERWISE.

173
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,458
BUT DON'T EXPECT ME TO
SHARE IN THAT OPINION,

174
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,291
I WILL NOT SEE YOU AS A MONSTER.

175
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,500
AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO
TO CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE.

176
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,333
YOU CAN DENY HOW LONELY YOU ARE,

177
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,875
BUT IT'S OBVIOUS TO ME
THAT YOU'RE MISERABLE.

178
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,458
AND I WILL NEVER THINK OF YOU
AS YOU THINK OF YOURSELF.

179
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,666
- Lir: WOW!

180
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,250
IMPRESSIVE LITTLE PEP TALK
YOU JUST IMPROVISED.

181
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,541
HELL, IF THIS WERE
A FAIRY TALE I'D BUY IT.

182
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,666
THE BRAVE DAMSEL
HOLDING OUT HOPE THAT

183
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,500
BENEATH THE FEARSOME BEAST LURKS
THE HEART OF A HUMAN BEING?

184
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,166
NOT IN THE
REAL WORLD, SWEETHEART.

185
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,791
MONSTERS LIKE THIS GUY
WILL ALWAYS BE MONSTERS.

186
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,375
- WHAT DOES THAT MATTER TO ME?

187
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,208
MONSTER OR NOT,
THERE'S NO REASON I SHOULD CARE.

188
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,166
HE'S MY FRIEND FIRST.

189
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,875
- THAT'S A VERY
SENTIMENTAL VIEW,

190
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,375
BUT WHETHER YOU CARE
ISN'T THE ISSUE.

191
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,833
THERE'S A WHOLE WORLD OUT THERE

192
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,125
WHOSE VERY EXISTENCE
IS THREATENED

193
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,666
EVERY MINUTE FREAKS LIKE
YOUR FRIEND DRAW BREATH.

194
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,958
FOR THE GREATER GOOD, HE HAS TO
BE PUT DOWN LIKE A RABID DOG.

195
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,833
- IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO IMPRESS ME?

196
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,208
- YOU DON'T CARE.

197
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,291
YOU REALLY DON'T CARE.

198
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,500
YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW...

199
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,958
YOU...

200
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,416
YOU JUST...

201
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,625
FERRIS...

202
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,958
IS IT REALLY OKAY
FOR ME TO LIVE?

203
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,791
- IDIOT, WITHOUT YOU AROUND,

204
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,916
WHAT DO YOU THINK I WOULD DO?

205
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,125
- WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT
REAL SOON, SWEETHEART.

206
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,708
SEE...

207
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,500
YOUR FRIEND'S ABOUT TO DIE.

208
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,625
- ( groans )

209
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,750
- FERRIS!

210
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,708
- RESONATE!

211
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,125
- PLEASE, NO.

212
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,541
DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

213
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,708
- FIGHT IT!

214
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,791
- Ryner: I CAN'T GO
THROUGH THIS AGAIN.

215
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,791
- Alpha Stigma:
WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

216
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,916
- SHUT UP!

217
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,916
- Alpha Stigma: NOTHING MATTERS!

218
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,833
- NO! YOU'RE WRONG!

219
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,416
- Alpha Stigma: THIS IS WHAT
YOU REALLY WANT.

220
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,625
TO DESTROY.
TO OBLITERATE. TO END.

221
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,458
- THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANT!

222
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,000
- LIFE, DEATH, JOY, PAIN.

223
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,875
NONE OF IT AMOUNTS TO ANYTHING.

224
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,041
- SHUT THE HELL UP!
YOU'RE WRONG!

225
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,458
- WHY DENY IT?
THERE'S NO POINT.

226
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:15,791
AS MUCH AS THIS WORLD HURTS YOU,
USED YOU UP, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

227
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,208
NOTHING DOES.

228
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,125
- STOP TALKING!
- COME ON.

229
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,916
LET'S BRING THE WHOLE THING
TO ITS KNEES.

230
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,333
EVERY CORNER OF IT IS YOURS
TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH.

231
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,083
OPEN UP. DECIMATE IT.

232
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,291
KILL UNTIL THERE'S
NOTHING LEFT!

233
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,500
REVEL IN SEEING IT ALL
GO UP IN FLAMES!

234
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,375
- ( screams ) NO!

235
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,375
- Ryner: DEEP DOWN,
I'M A MONSTER.

236
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:45,041
ONLY GOOD FOR SOWING
DEATH AND MISERY.

237
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,666
BLOODSTAINED HANDS
CAN'T HOLD ON TO A DAMN THING.

238
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,375
I KNOW THAT.

239
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,208
BUT...

240
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,166
I STILL WANT TO HELP PEOPLE!

241
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,166
I WANT TO REACH OUT AND TRY TO
SAVE THIS WORLD FROM ITSELF!

242
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,000
EVEN A MONSTER CAN
FEEL DESPAIR!

243
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,500
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING I CAN DO!

244
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,208
- WHAT THE HELL?

245
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,083
- ( screaming )

246
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,875
NO! YOU DON'T GET A SAY!

247
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,958
( breathing heavily )

248
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,125
- HOW THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT?

249
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,875
YOU... YOU STOPPED IT!

250
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,416
WHAT ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

251
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,833
- JUST SOME FREAK.

252
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,500
- LIKE HELL YOU ARE!

253
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,500
THE LATSEL THREAD?

254
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,708
- AH, IS THAT ITS PROPER NAME?
I HAD NO IDEA.

255
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,666
I'D BE HAPPY TO DELIVER
YOUR HEAD TO GASTARK PERSONALLY.

256
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,208
IN FACT I'LL SHOW YOU ALL
ROLAND'S HOSPITALITY.

257
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,833
I'LL BRING THE FIGHT
TO THEIR DOOR.

258
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,166
- NOW, SPUNQUEL!

259
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,166
- WHAT I SEEK
IS THUNDER! IZUCHI!

260
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,916
TIIR!

261
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:16,166
I'LL KEEP THE BASTARD AT BAY.
YOU SAVE THE CHILDREN.

262
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,583
- THANK YOU.

263
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,583
GASTARK, WE ARE NOT
FINISHED YET.

264
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,291
I WILL BE THE LAST
THING YOU SEE.

265
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:33,250
GET AWAY FROM HERE, RYNER.
THIS ISN'T YOUR PLACE.

266
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,583
- WHOA THERE, FREAK.
I DON'T THINK SO!

267
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,833
- SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

268
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,041
BUT I'M THE ONE YOU'RE
GONNA FIGHT TONIGHT.

269
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,666
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

270
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,500
ALL THAT B.S.
FOR ONE LOUSY CRYSTAL?

271
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,416
THE SOLVER OF ALL FORMULAS.

272
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,833
IMAGINE YOU CROPPING UP
IN A BACKWATER LIKE ROLAND...

273
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,708
- Ryner: SOLVER? WHAT?

274
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,708
- REALLY? YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T KNOW?

275
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,833
YOU'RE STANDING RIGHT HERE,
AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE?

276
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,208
( laughs )

277
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,125
WOW. THAT'S JUST SAD.

278
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,833
GUESS THE HERO'S GOT
A LONG ROAD AHEAD OF HIM

279
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,375
BEFORE HE'S COMPLETE, HUH?

280
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,416
( laughs )

281
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,125
- WELL, I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY

282
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,583
THAT OUR SITUATION HAS
ALTERED CONSIDERABLY.

283
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,750
- HEY!

284
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,833
- FERRIS IS DUE TO WAKE
ANY MOMENT NOW.

285
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,333
SHE'LL BE FINE.

286
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,833
SHE ONLY HAS A
SLIGHT CONCUSSION.

287
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,666
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

288
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,666
YOU'RE NO ORDINARY MONSTER.

289
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,250
WHICH MEANS THE QUESTION NOW IS
JUST WHAT EXACTLY THAT IMPLIES.

290
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,333
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

291
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,750
- OF COURSE.

292
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,875
I'M FINE.

293
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,833
SO, BE COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH ME.

294
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,041
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
YOUR DESERTION EFFECTED SION?

295
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,583
IF YOU'D SEEN THE LOOK
ON HIS FACE,

296
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,125
YOU'D KNOW BEYOND
A SHADOW OF A DOUBT

297
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,125
THE LAST THING HE WANTS
IS TO KILL YOU.

298
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,000
- THE MAN'S GONNA WORK HIMSELF
INTO AN EARLY GRAVE.

299
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,166
HE'D TAKE THE WHOLE WORLD
ON HIS SHOULDERS IF HE COULD.

300
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,083
A FLEA CAN'T DIE ON HIS WATCH

301
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,833
BUT THAT HE BLAMES
HIMSELF FOR IT.

302
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,916
I ALIGN MYSELF
TO THE MAN PROUDLY

303
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
BECAUSE IN THE WORLD
HE INTENDS TO BUILD,

304
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,625
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US MATTERS.

305
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,583
AND HERE I AM FEELING
SORRY FOR MYSELF.

306
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,583
PRETTY NARROW-MINDED, HUH?

307
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,875
- WELL, IT'S IN KEEPING
WITH YOUR CHARACTER.

308
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,708
SO TO BE FAIR, NONE OF THIS
CAME AS A SURPRISE.

309
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,250
- YEAH.

310
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,791
AND CHASING DOWN
A LOST CAUSE LIKE ME

311
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,125
IS IN KEEPING WITH YOURS.

312
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,000
SERIOUSLY, THE TWO OF YOU
ARE SOME PIECE OF WORK

313
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,625
NO ONE ELSE WOULD EVEN
WASTE THEIR TIME.

314
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,833
I WAS AFRAID OF BEING HURT.

315
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,750
AFRAID OF HURTING OTHER PEOPLE.

316
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,583
SO I DID WHAT I
ALWAYS DID. I RAN.

317
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,208
BUT I HAD NO RIGHT
TO FEEL ALONE.

318
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:08,208
HOWEVER BAD THINGS GOT,
HOWEVER SCARED I WAS,

319
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,208
I WAS WRONG TO THINK THAT.

320
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,250
I WON'T RUN ANYMORE.

321
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,208
PROMISE. I'M COMING HOME NOW.

322
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,375
WITH THE SHADOW OF GASTARK
GATHERING LIKE IT IS,

323
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,500
CHANCES ARE, ROLAND'LL NEED ME.

324
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,125
- THANK YOU.

325
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,833
- BUT I'LL ONLY COME BACK
ON ONE CONDITION.

326
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,083
AND IT'S A BIG ONE.

327
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,250
IF I WIND UP LOSING
CONTROL OVER MYSELF,

328
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,541
I WANT YOU TO BE
THE ONE WHO KILLS ME.

329
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,250
ALL THIS TIME,

330
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,666
I'VE BEEN RUNNING FROM THE TRUTH
ABOUT WHAT I REALLY AM.

331
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,791
MORE THAN THAT,

332
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:50,458
I WAS TERRIFIED THAT
I MIGHT END UP KILLING YOU.

333
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:54,500
NOW, KNOWING THAT, I WANT YOU
TO SHOW ME THE COURAGE...

334
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,791
- COURAGE?

335
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,500
- TO SEE THIS THROUGH TO THE END
AND NOT RUN LIKE I DID.

336
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,791
- FINE. IF YOU COME BACK
HOME WITH ME.

337
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:08,875
- THANK YOU.

338
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,458
- Luke: "RYNER LUTE IS RETURNING
TO ROLAND OF HIS OWN FREE WILL.

339
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,750
"IN ADDITION TO THIS,

340
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,791
A NUMBER OF MAGIC EYE
BEARERS ACROSS MENORIS

341
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,291
"HAVE JOINED FORCES
TO FIGHT AGAINST GASTARK.

342
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,416
"WITH RYNER LUTE ACTING AS
OUR LIAISON TO THESE CREATURES,

343
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,208
"ROLAND POSSESSES THE MEANS
TO CONFRONT ITS GREATEST ENEMY

344
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,083
"WITH THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE."

345
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,500
- WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO?

346
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,208
THIS IS ALL MEANINGLESS NOW.

347
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,833
IT MATTERS NOT HOW USEFUL
RYNER MIGHT BE. NOT ANYMORE.

348
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,916
WE GRASP AT STRAWS.

349
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,083
- TRUTH BE TOLD, YOUR MAJESTY,

350
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,583
HAD LUKE STOKKART
CARRIED THROUGH WITH THE ORDER

351
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,166
TO ELIMINATE RYNER LUTE,

352
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,041
THINGS WOULD HAVE FARED FAR
BETTER FOR YOU THAN NOW THEY DO.

353
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,250
IS THAT NOT WHY YOU ISSUED
THE DECREE TO BEGIN WITH?

354
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:04,083
- I WON'T...
I WON'T KILL MY FRIEND.

355
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,791
- YOU REFUSE TO PUT DOWN
A MONSTER, THEN?

356
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,083
- I DO.

357
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,291
- ( laughing )

358
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,041
THAT RESOLVE SETS YOU
ON A FAR, FAR CRUELER PATH.

359
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,416
CAN YOU NOT BRING YOURSELF

360
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,916
TO SEE THE MERCY IN
KILLING HIM SWIFTLY?

361
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,208
HE IS, AFTER ALL,
YOUR MAJESTY'S VALUED FRIEND.

362
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,916
BUT FAR BE IT FROM ME
TO SWAY THAT RESOLVE,

363
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,791
EVEN HAD YOU ELECTED
TO KILL HIM NOW,

364
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,375
SOON ANOTHER WOULD HAVE
COME TO TAKE HIS PLACE.

365
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,166
JUST AS ANOTHER
KING WOULD STEP IN

366
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,333
TO TAKE YOURS SHOULD YOU FALTER.

367
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,208
I SUPPOSE ONE NEEDN'T
SACRIFICE FRIENDS.

368
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,791
BUT ONE PATH LAYS
BEFORE YOU NOW,

369
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,500
AND THAT PATH REQUIRES
THE STRENGTH

370
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,541
TO RUTHLESSLY CRUSH UNDERFOOT
ALL ONE HOLDS DEAR,

371
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,166
SHOULD THE NEED ARISE.

372
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,750
FRIENDS. LOVED ONES. EVERYTHING.

373
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:56,375
THIS IS WHAT NATURE REQUIRES OF
ONE WHO WOULD DREAM AS YOU DO.

374
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,208
I PRAY YOU HAVE
NO REGRETS, YOUR MAJESTY.

375
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,625
MY KING...

376
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,250
MY HERO.

377
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,750
- ( theme song playing )

378
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,166
- Ryner: OKAY, ENOUGH WITH
ALL THE CRAP.

379
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,125
I KNOW I AGREED TO
COME BACK HOME, SURE,

380
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:43,875
BUT I HAVE LIMITS, YOU KNOW!

381
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,416
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

382
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,583
WAY TO BURY ME UP TO MY NECK
UNDER A MOUNTAIN OF PAPERWORK,

383
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,916
SION! VERY MATURE!

384
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,916
FRIGGIN' SLAVE-DRIVER! UGH!

385
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,458
I KNEW THIS WAS GONNA SUCK!
