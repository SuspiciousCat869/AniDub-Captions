1
01:00:21,875 --> 01:00:23,291
- Ryner: IMPERIAL NELPHA.

2
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:26,666
AN OLD, SPRAWLING PROVINCE
JUST TO THE WEST OF ROLAND.

3
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,916
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO
KINGDOMS HAVE BEEN STRAINED

4
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,416
FOR GENERATIONS.

5
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,333
BUT NELPHA'S CURRENT
EMPEROR PARTS COMPANY

6
01:00:32,416 --> 01:00:33,375
WITH HIS PREDECESSORS

7
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:35,000
BY PREFERRING TO ENRICH
HIS KINGDOM,

8
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:36,583
NOT WITH
THE SPOILS OF WAR,

9
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,208
BUT WITH CULTURE.

10
01:00:38,291 --> 01:00:40,500
THE PLACE IS HOME
TO MANY ANCIENT RUINS.

11
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:43,250
AMONG THEM, A GENEROUS
PORTION OF SITES

12
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:45,583
THOUGHT TO BEAR A
CONNECTION WITH HERO RELICS.

13
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:50,666
THERE'S TOO MANY.
I GIVE UP.

14
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:54,500
I'M TIRED. I'M HUNGRY.
I'M CRUELLY OVERWORKED.

15
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:56,416
- I DON'T SEE
ANY DANGO SHOPS.

16
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,666
YOU, DOG, SNIFF ONE OUT.

17
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,083
- Ryner: GIVE ME A REASON.

18
01:01:00,166 --> 01:01:02,625
- BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE ME IN A FOUL MOOD.

19
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:04,458
- YEAH, TOO LATE FOR THAT.

20
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:05,625
YOU KNOW WHAT?

21
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:07,791
SAVE YOUR BREATH,
I REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING.

22
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:10,333
SHORT OF FINDING AN INN
WHERE I CAN HAVE A GOOD NAP.

23
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:14,708
- HA, HA. SO, THAT'S YOUR
MODUS OPERANDI, HUH?

24
01:01:14,791 --> 01:01:16,583
I'VE READ
ALL ABOUT THAT RUSE.

25
01:01:16,666 --> 01:01:19,791
A MAN INVITES A GIRL
TO AN INN. PHASE ONE.

26
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:22,166
"DON'T WORRY," SAYS THE MAN,
"I ONLY WANT TO GET SOME SLEEP.

27
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,250
I WON'T TRY A THING, I PROMISE."

28
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:26,750
PHASE TWO, THE GIRL ACQUIESCES.

29
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,166
PHASE THREE, WHEN THEY'RE ALONE,

30
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,916
THE MAN PROVES HIMSELF
A WILD BEAST.

31
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,541
PHASE FOUR, THE GIRL'S HONOR
IS DEVOURED.

32
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:37,416
- WOW. YOU'VE GOT QUITE
AN IMAGINATION, HUH?

33
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,458
- HA! IMAGINATION
IS WHAT PROTECTS

34
01:01:39,541 --> 01:01:41,125
VIRTUOUS DAMSELS LIKE ME

35
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:44,625
FROM THE LECHEROUS INTRIGUES OF
SEX- CRAZED LUNATICS LIKE YOU.

36
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:46,666
- I'M GETTING REALLY
SICK OF THIS GAME.

37
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:49,458
- WHAT A COINCIDENCE,
PLAYTIME IS OVER.

38
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:52,166
WE'VE GOT BOOK- STACKS
TO POUR THROUGH.

39
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,291
- PLAYTIME? SO, STANDING
ON ME IS YOUR IDEA OF FUN?

40
01:01:58,041 --> 01:01:59,875
- YEAH, WELL I'M
STILL SICK OF IT.

41
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:03,416
- ( theme song playing )

42
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:35,083
- Ryner: ( chuckles ) NOW,
THIS IS A PROPER LIBRARY.

43
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:37,625
THIS PLACE OUGHT TO BE
BRIMMING WITH HEROIC LORE.

44
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:40,041
- GOOD. JUST DON'T TAKE
ALL DAY FINDING IT.

45
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:41,375
- OH, COME ON!

46
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:43,208
WOULD IT KILL YOU TO OFFER
A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT

47
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:44,583
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN?

48
01:03:44,666 --> 01:03:46,541
THERE DOES COME A POINT
WHEN JUST LOOKING AT YOU...

49
01:03:46,625 --> 01:03:50,041
UH, WIELD A SWORD IS REALLY
ALL THE INSPIRATION

50
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:51,916
I NEED TO HUNKER DOWN
AND HIT THE BOOKS.

51
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,458
SHE WILL BE THE END OF ME.

52
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:04,250
- HALT! NO BARBARIANS!

53
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:05,333
- BARBARIANS?

54
01:04:05,416 --> 01:04:07,125
- THIS IS A SACRED FONT
OF KNOWLEDGE,

55
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:09,541
A SHRINE TO THE HALLOWED
ARTS OF SCHOLARSHIP,

56
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:12,125
NOT A HOSTEL FOR UNRULY SAVAGES.

57
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:14,625
- LOOK, I KNOW SHE DOESN'T
EXACTLY DRESS THE PART

58
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:16,500
OF AN ACADEMIC, BUT STILL...

59
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:19,041
- Ferris: ( sighs ) I DRESS
THE PART OF A BELEAGUERED WOMAN

60
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:21,458
FENDING OFF THE ADVANCES
OF AN ACADEMIC.

61
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:23,666
- NOT EXACTLY A TONE
THAT'S GOING TO ENDEAR US

62
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,250
TO THE LIBRARY GUY HERE.

63
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:28,083
- WELL, I HAVE OTHER WILES
WITH WHICH TO ENDEAR.

64
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:31,375
- JUST KIDDING.

65
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:33,791
- I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.
SHE'S ALLOWED.

66
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:35,916
I SPOKE A BIT TOO
HASTILY BEFORE.

67
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,916
BESIDES, WHEN BEAUTY PROMOTES
ERUDITION, EVERYONE'S A WINNER.

68
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,125
- WAIT, YOU'RE ALLOWING HER IN
BUT NOT ME?

69
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:42,791
- STUPID BRATS.

70
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:44,916
- ( child screams )

71
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,041
- THEY'RE CHILDREN.
LEAVE THEM ALONE.

72
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:48,375
- YEAH?

73
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:50,166
WELL, FOR YOUR INFORMATION
THESE LITTLE BASTARDS

74
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,583
ARE THE ONES
WHO RAN INTO ME.

75
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:53,625
NOW THERE'S GRIME
ALL OVER MY SHIRT.

76
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:56,250
- YOU, MY FRIEND,
OWE US COMPENSATION.

77
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,208
- TOALE.
- LET GO OF MY BROTHER.

78
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:00,291
- IBEL, TELURA.
MAKE A RUN FOR IT.

79
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:01,333
- GET OFF OF ME.

80
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:03,541
- ( screams )

81
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:04,666
- Thug: STUPID LITTLE...

82
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,583
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

83
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:14,416
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE, HUH?
HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

84
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,958
THE BOOK YOU'RE HOLDING
JUST HAPPENS TO BE ONE

85
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:17,708
I'M ON THE HUNT FOR.

86
01:05:17,791 --> 01:05:19,041
- IT'S FUNNY HOW THINGS
WORK OUT, HUH?

87
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:20,666
- HEY, YOU!

88
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,041
- NOT IN FRONT OF THE CHILDREN.
- ( thug screams )

89
01:05:25,958 --> 01:05:27,791
- SO ANYWAY,
ABOUT YOUR BOOK...

90
01:05:27,875 --> 01:05:29,916
- ( groans )

91
01:05:32,458 --> 01:05:34,666
- ALWAYS BEWARE
OF THE CHARMING BEAST.

92
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:37,916
HE HAS MANY TRICKS WITH
WHICH TO LURE THE UNSUSPECTING.

93
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,625
- I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.

94
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:42,666
- FORGIVE ME,
BUT WHO ARE YOU TWO?

95
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:44,000
- Gainel: LORD TOALE.

96
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,375
- ( panting )

97
01:05:51,416 --> 01:05:53,791
- WE'VE HIT THE MOTHER LODE.

98
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:56,708
HEY, TOALE, ALL THE ONES
ON THE TOP SHELF, IF YOU WOULD.

99
01:05:56,791 --> 01:05:58,125
- MY PLEASURE. COME ON.

100
01:05:59,375 --> 01:06:01,291
- ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO THIS.

101
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:03,375
- ( grunts )

102
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:05,250
HEY, KNOCK IT OFF!

103
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:06,458
- WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE,

104
01:06:06,541 --> 01:06:08,833
CASUALLY BARKING ORDERS
TO HIS LORDSHIP?

105
01:06:08,916 --> 01:06:10,750
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

106
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,708
LORD TOALE JUST HAPPENS
TO BE NOT ONLY THE GRANDSON

107
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:13,875
OF EMPEROR GREAD,

108
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:16,958
BUT QUITE POSSIBLY
NEXT IN LINE TO RULE.

109
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:19,625
- THE BIG BLACK ONE
UP TOP OVER THERE, TOO.

110
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:20,833
- WITH THE FRAYED EDGES?

111
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:22,583
- YEAH, THAT'S THE
ONE. THANK YOU.

112
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:24,875
- HAVE YOU HEARD
A WORD I'VE SAID?

113
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:27,416
- PLEASE, UNCLE GAINEL,
IT'S NO TROUBLE TO HELP HIM OUT.

114
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,666
- HE'S NO ONE.

115
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,666
FETCHING ODDS AND ENDS
FOR A MISCREANT LIKE HIM

116
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,791
WILL ONLY BRING SHAME
TO THE AUGUST HEAD

117
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:34,416
OF IMPERIAL NELPHA!

118
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,083
- NO. WHAT WILL TRULY BRING
SHAME TO IMPERIAL NELPHA

119
01:06:37,166 --> 01:06:38,708
IS SHIRKING GRATITUDE.

120
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:42,666
AND BESIDES, I'M THE FRUIT
OF MY FATHER'S INDISCRETIONS.

121
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:44,458
A DISCARDED ONE AT THAT.

122
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:46,958
HARDLY A MAN OWED DEFERENCE.

123
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:49,666
MY SIBLINGS AND I WERE
CORRALLED TO A MINOR ESTATE

124
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:52,375
BECAUSE OUR MOTHERS HAD
THE MISFORTUNE TO BE LOWBORN.

125
01:06:53,416 --> 01:06:55,000
I AM SIMPLY ONE OF THE RABBLE.

126
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:58,166
- DON'T SPEAK SO.
YOUR FATHER'S AN IMBECILE.

127
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:01,208
NOT A SOUL IN THE REALM
PREFERS STARNEL AS HEIR

128
01:07:01,291 --> 01:07:03,000
TO THE THRONE OVER YOU.

129
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:05,750
- PURSUE THIS NO FURTHER,
PLEASE, UNCLE.

130
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:08,791
I'VE NO ROMANTIC NOTIONS
OF KINGSHIP.

131
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:11,250
SO, WHAT ELSE
CAN I HELP YOU FIND?

132
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:14,541
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,
THAT SHELF OVER THERE.

133
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:15,625
- I'M HAPPY TO.

134
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:16,875
- I CAN'T REACH THIS ONE.

135
01:07:18,083 --> 01:07:19,125
- SURE YOU CAN.

136
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:22,375
- YOU SEE.
- THANKS.

137
01:07:22,458 --> 01:07:23,708
- WHAT A NICE GUY.

138
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:26,333
IT'S LIKE HE AND SION WERE
CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH.

139
01:07:26,416 --> 01:07:29,750
- AND YET, FATE LEFT HIM
TO FEND FOR HIMSELF.

140
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:31,666
HE AND HIS SIBLINGS
ARE ALL ALONE,

141
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,250
A BROKEN FAMILY.

142
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:34,708
- ( sobs )

143
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:37,458
- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.
FAMILY IS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT.

144
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:39,458
- ...WHEN WE'VE FOUND IT?
- I CAN.

145
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:41,208
- AH, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

146
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:43,958
- I'VE GOT A BETTER ONE.

147
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:45,500
JUST WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW?

148
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:48,708
- TARIFF EXEMPTION
IS MEANINGLESS

149
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:50,750
UNTIL THE FLOOD VICTIMS
CAN RECEIVE AID.

150
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:53,000
OF COURSE, THE QUESTION
OF EXPANDING LORD BERYL'S HOL...

151
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:55,000
- Fiole: YOUR MAJESTY.

152
01:07:55,083 --> 01:07:57,583
- WHAT IS IT, FIOLE?
- MUST I SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU?

153
01:07:57,666 --> 01:07:59,708
YOU'VE BEEN GRINDING AWAY
FOR HOURS WITHOUT SO MUCH

154
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:01,083
AS TOUCHING YOUR MEAL.

155
01:08:01,166 --> 01:08:02,708
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

156
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:05,041
- YES, I KNOW. OH, WHILE
I'VE GOT YOU HERE, THOUGH,

157
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:07,041
WHAT'S THE STATUS
OF KRIADE'S DEBT?

158
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:08,750
- I'VE DRAWN UP
A FULLY DETAILED REPORT

159
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:10,250
OF THEIR FINANCIAL STATE.

160
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:12,291
BUT YOU WON'T SEE THE FIRST
QUILL STROKE OF IT UNTIL YOU

161
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:13,541
PUT SOMETHING IN YOUR STOMACH.

162
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:14,625
( laughs )

163
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:16,583
DOESN'T LOOK AS THOUGH
I HAVE A CHOICE.

164
01:08:16,666 --> 01:08:18,791
EVIDENTLY I WAS QUITE
RIGHT TO APPOINT YOU.

165
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:23,000
- LOOKING OUT FOR THE MAN
WHO SAVED MY SISTER

166
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:25,125
IS THE LEAST I COULD DO.

167
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:26,625
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN
SO COMPASSIONATE

168
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:29,666
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT WOULD'VE BECOME OF US.

169
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:32,541
THAT A LOWBORN ORPHAN LIKE ME
COULD EVER BE WORTHY

170
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:34,583
OF SUCH GRACE
IS UNTHINKABLE.

171
01:08:34,666 --> 01:08:37,708
- BITE YOUR TONGUE.
OF COURSE YOU'RE WORTHY...

172
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:40,208
WORTH IS NOT A FUNCTION
OF CLASS, WE'RE ALL OF US

173
01:08:40,291 --> 01:08:42,083
FELLOW TRAVELERS.

174
01:08:42,166 --> 01:08:45,250
OF COURSE, THIS WORLD BEING
WHAT IT IS, OUR BASER NATURES

175
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:46,833
IGNORE THE FACT.

176
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:49,833
AND YET, WE MUST LET HOPE
SPRING ETERNAL THAT THE WORLD

177
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:51,750
CAN BE TRANSFORMED.

178
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:53,625
- LET HOPE SPRING ETERNAL?

179
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:56,166
- WE MUST NEVER ALLOW
STATUS TO DICTATE

180
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:57,916
OUR ESTEEM
FOR HUMAN BEINGS,

181
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,541
BECAUSE WHOEVER YOU ARE,
NO MATTER HOW LOWBORN,

182
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:03,458
THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE WHO
WILL LOOK UP TO YOU, ALWAYS

183
01:09:03,541 --> 01:09:05,541
THOSE WHO WILL CARRY YOUR TORCH.

184
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:09,666
- WELL, I FOR ONE WILL ALWAYS
CARRY YOUR TORCH, SIR.

185
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:11,500
AS LONG AS I'M ABLE.

186
01:09:11,583 --> 01:09:13,541
- HUH, NOW, I AM UNWORTHY.

187
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:16,416
- ENOUGH OF THAT.

188
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,791
EAT A LITTLE SOMETHING
AND REST FOR A WHILE.

189
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:21,041
YOU'LL NEED YOUR WITS
ABOUT YOU FOR THE BANQUET.

190
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:23,625
- ALL RIGHT.
BUT ONLY ON CONDITION

191
01:09:23,708 --> 01:09:25,333
THAT YOU TAKE
THE WEEKEND OFF.

192
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:27,291
- UH, BUT SIR...

193
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:29,416
- YOUR SISTER MUST
MISS YOU, FIOLE.

194
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,666
GO PAY HER A CALL.

195
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:34,416
- OF COURSE, YOUR MAJESTY.

196
01:09:40,166 --> 01:09:44,125
- COME ON, IS THIS A BANQUET
OR A FUNERAL, YOUR MAJESTY?

197
01:09:44,208 --> 01:09:44,958
- I'M SORRY?

198
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:46,125
- YOU'RE ALWAYS SO DILIGENT,

199
01:09:46,208 --> 01:09:49,208
WHY NOT THROW YOURSELF
INTO PLAYING HOST?

200
01:09:49,291 --> 01:09:50,375
- ( chuckles )

201
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:52,666
COME, YOU JUST WANT
AN EXCUSE TO MINGLE.

202
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:54,833
- YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE
THE CHARADE, YOUR HIGHNESS.

203
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:57,000
CLAUGH IS FRAIL BEFORE
THE FAIRER SEX.

204
01:09:57,083 --> 01:09:59,458
- THAT'S RICH. FUNNY YOU'RE
CHATTING HERE WITH US, THOUGH.

205
01:09:59,541 --> 01:10:01,458
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
CHATTING UP LADY PEARL.

206
01:10:01,541 --> 01:10:02,541
- PIG!

207
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:05,250
- BOTH OF YOU, PLEASE.
GO SOCIALIZE.

208
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:06,958
- Both: SIR.

209
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:08,708
- ( both laughing )

210
01:10:08,791 --> 01:10:12,708
- MY, WHAT SUBTLETY.
WISH I HAD THEIR SPIRIT, THOUGH.

211
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,875
- HIGHNESS,

212
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:17,958
WON'T YOU DO US THE HONOR
OF EMERGING FROM THE SHADOWS

213
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:19,708
TO TAKE CENTER STAGE?

214
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:22,083
- LORDS BERYL AND PEARL.

215
01:10:22,166 --> 01:10:24,208
I TRUST YOU ARE ENJOYING
YOURSELVES, YES?

216
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:27,083
- DAZZLED, AS ALWAYS,
BY THE UNPARALLELED OPULENCE

217
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:28,916
OF YOUR MAJESTY'S SOIREES.

218
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,583
- YOU CERTAINLY DO HAVE
A TALENT FOR POMP, SIR.

219
01:10:31,666 --> 01:10:32,666
- ( chuckles )

220
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,583
- GENTLEMEN, EXPENSE
IS NO OBJECT

221
01:10:34,666 --> 01:10:36,166
WHEN PANDERING
TO COSMOPOLITAN

222
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:37,416
TASTES SUCH AS YOURS.

223
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,250
- ( all laughing )

224
01:10:41,875 --> 01:10:44,958
- KLAUSBERR AND STEARIED
LEER AT ME FROM THE WINGS,

225
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:47,416
DARING TO VEIL THEIR
ANTI-MONARCHIST LEANINGS

226
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,250
BEHIND EMPTY SMILES,

227
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:52,041
EVEN AS THEY SEND
THEIR LACKEYS OUT AGAINST ME.

228
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:56,125
- SIR?

229
01:10:57,583 --> 01:10:59,208
- YES? WHAT IS IT, CLAUGH?

230
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:01,250
- I JUST RECEIVED WORD
FROM THE GUARDSMEN.

231
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,666
- IT'S FIOLE. HE'S BEEN
FOUND MURDERED.

232
01:11:07,416 --> 01:11:09,750
- Beryl: FIOLE?
AH, YES, OF COURSE,

233
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:12,125
THE COMMONER YOUR MAJESTY
RECENTLY APPOINTED TO BE

234
01:11:12,208 --> 01:11:14,333
HIS PERSONAL SECRETARY.

235
01:11:14,416 --> 01:11:16,458
- HE'S BEEN MURDERED, YOU SAY?

236
01:11:16,541 --> 01:11:18,541
WELL, AT LEAST THERE'S SOME
SOLACE TO BE GLEANED

237
01:11:18,625 --> 01:11:21,333
FROM THE FACT
THAT HE'S A COMMONER.

238
01:11:21,416 --> 01:11:25,291
- QUITE SO. HAD A NOBLE BEEN
SLAIN WITHIN THE CASTLE KEEP,

239
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:28,041
WE'D HAVE QUITE THE SCANDAL
ON OUR HANDS, WOULDN'T WE?

240
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:29,583
- ( laughs )

241
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:36,916
- SION.

242
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:41,458
- TRAGIC, THOUGH.

243
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:44,291
THE LAD WAS QUITE EXCEPTIONAL
AT FORGING MY SIGNATURE.

244
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:46,041
- ( all chuckling )

245
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:53,125
- MONSTERS.

246
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,166
- I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SLIT
THE BOY'S THROAT MYSELF.

247
01:12:15,041 --> 01:12:17,000
MY WEAKNESS SLEW HIM.

248
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,333
- STOP.

249
01:12:18,416 --> 01:12:19,875
GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF.

250
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:27,083
- THANK YOU, CLAUGH.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

251
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:40,708
- Fiole: ESLINA, SORRY FOR
TAKING SO LONG TO WRITE BACK.

252
01:12:40,791 --> 01:12:43,291
I'M PLEASED TO HEAR YOU'RE
DOING SO WELL FOR YOURSELF.

253
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:45,500
A LETTER FROM YOU ALWAYS
INSPIRES ME TO REACH

254
01:12:45,583 --> 01:12:47,875
A LITTLE HIGHER
THAN I THINK I CAN.

255
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:51,250
MY SUPERIOR MAKES ME FEEL
THE SAME WAY, IN FACT.

256
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:54,583
ASIDE FROM YOU, HIS MAJESTY
IS BY FAR THE GREATEST PERSON

257
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:55,958
I'VE EVER KNOWN.

258
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:58,375
HE BELIEVES IN DEALING
WITH PEOPLE, EVEN COMMONERS

259
01:12:58,458 --> 01:12:59,875
AS EQUALS.

260
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:02,541
HE USES HIS POWER
TO PROTECT THE DOWNTRODDEN.

261
01:13:04,041 --> 01:13:07,458
- CLAUGH, ARRANGE
FOR HIS INTERNMENT

262
01:13:07,541 --> 01:13:11,708
CALNE, ATTEND TO ESLINA.
BEFORE THE NOBLES DO.

263
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:12,916
- Both: SIR.

264
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,958
- SENTIMENTAL, FOOLISH BOY.

265
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,875
YOU WERE WRONG TO PRAISE ME.

266
01:13:32,958 --> 01:13:35,291
I DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER
TO PROTECT YOU.

267
01:13:37,333 --> 01:13:39,000
ONLY TO BURY YOU.

268
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:43,291
- ( sobs ) FIOLE.

269
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:02,375
- Lucile: SHOCK,
BITTERNESS, HATRED,

270
01:14:02,458 --> 01:14:06,583
ANGER, REPENTANCE, MISERY.

271
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:07,833
- ( chuckles )

272
01:14:07,916 --> 01:14:09,916
TELL ME, SHOULD REVENGE
COMPLETE THE SEQUENCE.

273
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,125
IF SO, I AM HAPPY TO BE

274
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:14,000
THE LAST THING A
CORRUPT NOBLE SEES.

275
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:17,208
- NO. NOT YET.
I WILL PICK MY MOMENT.

276
01:14:18,458 --> 01:14:21,791
- CAN YOU ENDURE THE WAIT?
- PERHAPS.

277
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,708
IF NOT, I'M SURE YOU
CAN BE COUNTED ON

278
01:14:23,791 --> 01:14:26,416
TO REDRESS THE IMBALANCE,

279
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:29,166
BY ARRANGING IT SO YOU'RE
THE LAST THING I SEE.

280
01:14:30,208 --> 01:14:32,208
- AS INDEED I WOULD.

281
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:37,166
A MAN WHO CANNOT RULE HIMSELF
HAS NO BUSINESS RULING A PEOPLE.

282
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:42,666
- RYNER LUTE,

283
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:44,000
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

284
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:47,666
YOU AND FERRIS HAVE
A KING'S ENVY AT YOUR BACK.

285
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:48,833
- Girl: NO FAIR!

286
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:51,166
MAKE STUPID-HEAD GIVE
ME BACK MY SUPPER.

287
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:52,500
- ( boy crying )

288
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:54,000
- SHUT UP.

289
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:57,791
- STOP WITH THE BICKERING
AND EAT. HEY, SLOW IT DOWN.

290
01:14:57,875 --> 01:14:59,000
- SORRY ABOUT THIS.

291
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:00,708
HAVING TO IMPOSE
ON YOU AND EVERYTHING.

292
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:03,541
- TRUST ME, YOU'RE WELCOME.
YOU SEE HOW WE ARE HERE.

293
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:06,125
TWO EXTRA HOUSEGUESTS
ARE NOTHING WE CAN'T HANDLE.

294
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:09,166
HANG ON, WHERE'D
THAT COME FROM?

295
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:11,625
- THE NICE LADY AT THE
GENERAL STORE GAVE IT TO US.

296
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:13,083
IT'S FOR GOOD LUCK.

297
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:15,625
SHE SAYS SHE HOPES YOU WIN
AGAINST THE CROWN PRINCE.

298
01:15:15,708 --> 01:15:16,833
- ( chuckles )

299
01:15:16,916 --> 01:15:19,375
- Ryner: SEEMS A LOT
OF PEOPLE FEEL THAT WAY.

300
01:15:19,458 --> 01:15:21,291
- WELL, I GUESS EVERYONE
HAS THEIR OWN OPINION

301
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:22,625
ON THE SUBJECT.

302
01:15:22,708 --> 01:15:24,791
BUT I THINK I'M FAR MORE
USEFUL HERE THAN I'D EVER

303
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:26,208
BE AS AN EMPEROR.

304
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,666
- BETWEEN SION AND TOALE,
CROOKED NOBLEMEN EVERYWHERE,

305
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:34,250
MUST BE TREMBLING
IN THEIR BOOTS.

306
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:35,666
- ( screams )

307
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:38,458
- PREPARE TO DIE, BEAST!
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

308
01:15:38,541 --> 01:15:40,125
- I'LL RESCUE YOU, SIS.

309
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:41,416
- ( grunts )

310
01:15:42,541 --> 01:15:44,083
- Ferris: EXPLAIN YOURSELF.

311
01:15:46,791 --> 01:15:48,416
- FERRIS!
- IRIS.

312
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,416
- I GOT SO WORRIED WHEN YOU
LEFT WITHOUT SAYING GOODBYE,

313
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,291
THAT I JUST HAD TO FOLLOW
YOUR TRAIL AND TRY TO SAVE YOU

314
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:53,458
FROM THE JAWS OF
THE VICIOUS BEAST

315
01:15:53,541 --> 01:15:54,708
WHO'D SNATCHED YOU AWAY.

316
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:56,833
- I SEE. MY APOLOGIES.

317
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:59,958
- DON'T TELL ME.
THIS IS YOUR LITTLE SISTER.

318
01:16:00,041 --> 01:16:01,958
- YES. ISN'T SHE ADORABLE?

319
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:04,625
- WHEN I ASKED HIS HIGHNESS
WHERE YOU WERE, HE SAID

320
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:06,166
A WILD BEAST TOOK YOU.

321
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:08,250
AND THAT YOU WERE ON A QUEST
TO FIND THE GREATEST DANGO SHOP

322
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:09,625
IN THE WORLD.

323
01:16:09,708 --> 01:16:11,500
AND IF I COULD FIND YOU,
HE'D DEPUTIZE ME AND MAKE ME

324
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:13,500
HIS OWN SPECIAL ROYAL MESSENGER.

325
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:15,083
- SO, BASICALLY
THIS LITTLE HELLION

326
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:17,500
IS NOW OUR MAIN POINT
OF CONTACT WITH SION?

327
01:16:17,583 --> 01:16:20,125
- YOU GUESSED IT.
NOW, TELL ME I'M GREAT.

328
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,958
- COME NOW, SWEETIE.
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

329
01:16:22,041 --> 01:16:26,250
- WAIT, SEE? A WYNNIT DANGO
COMBINATION SET.

330
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:28,875
- ONE- HUNDRED POINTS.

331
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:32,541
- YAY! ONE- HUNDRED POINTS.
NOW TELL ME I'M GREAT.

332
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:35,625
- UH, SURE. JOB WELL DONE.

333
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:40,166
- OH, NO. I TALKED TO A
WILD BEAST. NOW, I'M RUINED.

334
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:43,041
- FEAR NOT, CHILD.
THE RUIN IS MINE.

335
01:16:43,125 --> 01:16:45,791
FOR I SPOKE
TO THE CREATURE FIRST.

336
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,666
- ( sobs )

337
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:50,708
- NO. YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS!

338
01:16:51,916 --> 01:16:54,916
FOR MY SISTER'S HONOR.

339
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,500
- ( groans )

340
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:01,291
- Sion: A GOODWILL MISSION
TO NELPHA?

341
01:17:01,375 --> 01:17:03,416
- Stearied: YES, YOUR MAJESTY.

342
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,458
LEST OLD TENSIONS
BE REKINDLED

343
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:09,416
BY WHAT OUR NEIGHBORS
MIGHT CONSTRUE AS ALOOFNESS.

344
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,500
IF I MAY, IT IS PARAMOUNT
THAT WE ALIGN OURSELVES

345
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:13,916
TO EMPEROR GREAD.

346
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,458
HIS PLAN FOR NELPHA IS ONE
IN WHICH PEACE WITH ROLAND

347
01:17:16,541 --> 01:17:17,958
IS CENTRAL.

348
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:20,666
THEREFORE THE INTERESTS OF
EVERYONE WOULD BEST BE SERVED

349
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,791
BY A SHOW OF SUPPORT.

350
01:17:22,875 --> 01:17:25,375
- THERE ARE FIRST A NUMBER
OF INTERNAL ISSUES THAT

351
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:26,666
BEG MY ATTENTION.

352
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,791
I CANNOT GIVE YOU
AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW.

353
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:32,458
- WELL, I FOR MY PART,
AM SATISFIED THAT YOUR GRACE,

354
01:17:32,541 --> 01:17:36,000
BEAR IN THE MIND THE
IMPLICATIONS OF TOO MUCH DELAY.

355
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:36,750
- IT'S A TRAP.

356
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:38,250
AS A FISH OUT OF WATER,

357
01:17:38,333 --> 01:17:40,541
YOU CAN BE PICKED OFF
WITH RECKLESS ABANDON.

358
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:42,291
- I TAKE IT THERE
ARE THOSE IN NELPHA,

359
01:17:42,375 --> 01:17:45,416
WHO SUPPORT OUR HOME- GROWN
ANTI- MONARCHIST CONTINGENT?

360
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:46,958
- NO DOUBT OF IT, SIR.

361
01:17:47,041 --> 01:17:49,125
THEY DON'T DARE MAKE
AN ATTEMPT ON YOUR LIFE HERE,

362
01:17:49,208 --> 01:17:52,833
SO AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO NELPHA
IS JUST THE PRETEXT THEY NEED.

363
01:17:52,916 --> 01:17:54,750
- AND YET THEY KILL FIOLE.

364
01:18:00,958 --> 01:18:01,666
- PARDON ME.

365
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,166
THERE WAS NO ONE HERE,

366
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:06,375
SO I THOUGHT I'D MAKE MYSELF
COMFORTABLE WAITING FOR YOU.

367
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:07,875
- WHO ARE YOU?

368
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:09,541
- MIRAN FROAUDE.

369
01:18:10,458 --> 01:18:13,375
SON OF MARQUIS KARLAL FROAUDE.

370
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:15,666
CURRENTLY, I AM A
LIEUTENANT COLONEL

371
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:18,000
OF THE ROLAND IMPERIAL ARMY.

372
01:18:19,375 --> 01:18:22,250
- AND WHAT DOES A NOBLE'S SON
WANT OF THE KING?

373
01:18:22,333 --> 01:18:25,708
- I WOULD ENQUIRE AFTER
THE SMALL, CLANDESTINE FACTION,

374
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:27,958
WITH WHICH HE HOPES
TO OUST THE LANDED GENTRY.

375
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:29,875
- HOW DARE YOU?
- HOLD ON.

376
01:18:29,958 --> 01:18:33,416
- YOUR REPUTATION PRECEDES YOU,
MIRAN FROAUDE.

377
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,791
YOU WERE MADE
A LIEUTENANT BY SEVENTEEN.

378
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:39,125
YOUR CONSIDERABLE GIFTS
LED TO A SWIFT PROMOTION.

379
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:41,125
BUT WHILE YOU ARE
THE MARQUIS'S SON,

380
01:18:41,208 --> 01:18:43,000
IT IS BY ADOPTION
RATHER THAN BLOOD.

381
01:18:45,375 --> 01:18:48,916
- I TAKE IT YOUR GRACE'S LATE
SECRETARY DID HIS JOB WELL.

382
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,625
DOUBTLESS, HE TOLD YOU
OF MY RUTHLESSNESS.

383
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:55,333
I AM A MAN FOR WHOM
RAW AMBITION JUSTIFIES

384
01:18:55,416 --> 01:18:58,208
ANY MEANS AT MY DISPOSAL.

385
01:18:58,291 --> 01:19:01,500
- THIS I KNOW AND YOU SEEK
AN AUDIENCE WITH ME?

386
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:03,041
- PRIVATELY.

387
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:07,333
- CLAUGH, PLEASE LEAVE US,
WILL YOU?

388
01:19:07,416 --> 01:19:08,333
- SIR.

389
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:11,000
- I WOULD SPEAK
TO HIM IN PRIVATE.

390
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:13,916
- YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO HEAR
EVERYONE OUT, DON'T YOU?

391
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,916
- THANK YOU.
- JUST WATCH YOUR BACK.

392
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:23,500
- THERE, I'M ALL ATTENTION, SIR.

393
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:26,125
- AH, BUT IT IS I SHOULD
BE ATTENTIVE TO YOUR NEEDS,

394
01:19:26,208 --> 01:19:27,083
YOUR HIGHNESS.

395
01:19:27,166 --> 01:19:27,958
- WHAT?

396
01:19:28,041 --> 01:19:29,625
- MY SOLE PURPOSE HERE, LIEGE,

397
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:33,583
IS TO ANSWER A NEED AND QUITE
A DESPERATE ONE AT THAT.

398
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:36,458
A GREAT MANY LIGHTS
ARE DRAWN TO YOU.

399
01:19:36,541 --> 01:19:39,916
STRONG, DAZZLING,
RADIANT LIGHTS.

400
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,916
LIGHTS THAT WOULD SHINE
ON A WORLD TRANSFORMED.

401
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,375
AND YET TO SEE
THEIR HOPES FULFILLED,

402
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:47,000
YOU MUST DEAL IN SHADOW.

403
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:50,500
AND ENSHROUD YOURSELF
IN MIDNIGHT.

404
01:19:50,583 --> 01:19:52,458
CAN A MAN LIKE YOU ENDURE
THE WEIGHT OF SUCH

405
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:54,458
A FUNDAMENTAL DISPARITY?

406
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:58,041
I THINK NOT, SIR.
YOU ARE THIS LAND'S KING.

407
01:19:58,125 --> 01:20:02,500
YOU MUST EMULATE THOSE LIGHTS
SO DRAWN TO YOU. TO WHICH END?

408
01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:05,250
WHY NOT SIMPLY DEFER
THE BURDEN OF SHADOWS

409
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:08,250
TO ONE WHO IS MORE ACCUSTOMED
TO THEIR RAIMENT THAN YOU?

410
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:09,833
SUCH AS MYSELF?

411
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:13,291
- HOW DO YOU DARE
SUCH PRESUMPTUOUSNESS?

412
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:15,458
TO SPEAK AS ONE
WHO KNOWS MY MIND.

413
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:21,333
- I SPEAK AS ONE
WHO KNOWS YOUR HEART.

414
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:24,583
- OH? THEN PLEASE LAY BARE.

415
01:20:24,666 --> 01:20:26,875
- IN THE ANNALS OF HISTORY,

416
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:29,041
ROLAND HAS BEEN LITTLE
MORE THAN A RECALCITRANT

417
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:31,833
CUB AMONG LIONS.

418
01:20:31,916 --> 01:20:34,708
YOU WOULD DRAPE IT'S BANNER
PROUDLY ACROSS THE WHOLE

419
01:20:34,791 --> 01:20:36,500
OF MENORIS.

420
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:39,916
SUBJECT THE ENTIRE CONTINENT
TO YOUR ROYAL WILL.

421
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:46,000
- ( chuckles )

422
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:49,000
- IS MY HEART REALLY
SO GRASPING AS ALL THAT?

423
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:51,958
NOT TO DISAPPOINT
BUT WARFARE ISN'T MY AIM.

424
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:55,416
QUITE THE OPPOSITE. I SEEK
ONLY TO RULE PEACEFULLY.

425
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:59,041
- BUT OF COURSE, YOUR GRACE,
A KING DARE NOT MAKE IT PLAIN.

426
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:02,041
DISCRETION IS THE BETTER PART
OF VALOR, AFTER ALL.

427
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:05,916
I ASK AGAIN, APPOINT
ME TO THE SHADOWS.

428
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,833
USE ME AS YOU WOULD A SWORD.

429
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:09,250
AND NOT EVEN MY FATHER'S LIFE

430
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:11,666
SHALL STAND IN THE WAY
OF MY DUTY TO YOU.

431
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:14,916
THUS, I PLEDGE MY FEALTY.

432
01:21:24,458 --> 01:21:28,250
- THE LIFE OF THE MAN WHO
RAISED YOU CANNOT BE SO CHEAP.

433
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:30,625
- ( chuckles )
A MERE FIGURE OF SPEECH.

434
01:21:52,666 --> 01:21:56,291
- VERY WELL THEN. I ACCEPT
YOUR OFFER OF LOYALTY.

435
01:21:59,333 --> 01:22:01,333
- I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO BE WORTHY.

436
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:15,125
- ( theme song playing )

437
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:45,708
- Ryner: SINCE WHEN AM I
QUALIFIED TO BE A SENTRY?

438
01:23:45,791 --> 01:23:47,666
WELL, I GUESS A RULER
LIKE SION HAS SO MANY

439
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:49,125
ENEMIES TO BE WARY OF,

440
01:23:49,208 --> 01:23:51,125
HE CAN'T LOOK JUST ANYWHERE
FOR PEOPLE TO PROTECT HIM.

441
01:23:51,208 --> 01:23:53,875
BUT STILL, THOUGH.
WHY ME?

442
01:23:53,958 --> 01:23:55,708
THIS IS SO
INCREDIBLY NOT COOL.
