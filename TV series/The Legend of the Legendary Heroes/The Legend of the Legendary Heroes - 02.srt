1
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:23,708
- Lord 1: WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

2
01:00:23,791 --> 01:00:25,583
- BASTARD SON OF A PEASANT!

3
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:28,000
- ( Sion groaning )

4
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:31,458
- Sion's mom: I'VE BEEN HAPPY,
SION. REALLY, I HAVE.

5
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:34,416
BECAUSE I HAD YOU.

6
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,833
YOU'VE GROWN INTO SUCH AN
AMAZING YOUNG MAN ALREADY.

7
01:00:37,916 --> 01:00:40,291
AND I COULDN'T BE PROUDER
OF YOU, MY DARLING.

8
01:00:42,958 --> 01:00:45,125
- ( all laughing )

9
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:48,916
- STILL DEFIANT?

10
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,083
I TOLD YOU NOT TO LOOK AT ME!

11
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:52,750
- STAY DOWN!
- LOWLY DOG!

12
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:56,000
- Sion's mom: IN THE END,
HATEFUL WORDS AMOUNT TO NOTHING.

13
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:58,666
HOWEVER LOWBORN YOU ARE,

14
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:01,583
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE
GLAD TO CARRY YOUR TORCH,

15
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:03,666
TO LOVE YOU.

16
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:06,958
EVEN IF I'M NOT THERE,
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

17
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,333
YOU'LL NEVER BE ALONE.

18
01:01:13,541 --> 01:01:16,375
NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THAT.

19
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:20,750
- ( theme song playing )

20
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:51,458
- Roll: ACADEMY MOCK BATTLE
TRAINING BEGINS SOON.

21
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:53,000
IF WE DON'T ASSEMBLE
A TEAM QUICKLY,

22
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:54,583
WE COULD GET LEFT BEHIND.

23
01:02:55,791 --> 01:02:58,458
- I THINK I HAVE A LEAD.
- A LEAD.

24
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:01,083
YOU MEAN HIM.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

25
01:03:01,166 --> 01:03:03,958
I'D LIKE TO SEE
WHAT HE'S CAPABLE OF.

26
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:07,375
BUT FIRST, WE WOULD HAVE
TO GET HIM TO SHOW UP.

27
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:08,666
- I UNDERSTAND YOUR
INTEREST, BUT--

28
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,083
- TWO DAYS.

29
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:11,791
THAT'S ALL I NEED, ROLL.

30
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:15,125
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING, SIR?

31
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,041
- A LITTLE RESEARCH.
IN THE USUAL PLACE.

32
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:23,375
THIS ACADEMY GATHERS TOGETHER
ORPHANS AND CHILDREN

33
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:25,000
OF IMPRISONED CRIMINALS,

34
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:28,041
THEN TURNS THEM INTO
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION

35
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:31,125
TO KEEP THE NOBLE SONS
OFF THE FRONT LINE.

36
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:33,833
EXCEPT HALF NOBLE BASTARDS
LIKE ME.

37
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:37,416
AS FOR THE BEARER
OF THE ALPHA STIGMA,

38
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,500
"ROLAND'S GREATEST MAGICIAN"
RYNER LUTE,

39
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:43,666
HE COMES TO GERMER KLEISROLE
TRAINING INSTITUTE

40
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:46,666
BY WAY OF ROLAND SPECIAL
INSTITUTE NUMBER 307.

41
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:49,791
WHERE HE WAS KNOWN AS
"THE BLACK HAIRED DEVIL."

42
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:53,125
- ( snoring )

43
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:55,708
- WHO'S THERE?
- ( exclaims )

44
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:57,375
NOT A GOOD NAP!

45
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,875
I'M SO TIRED!

46
01:03:59,958 --> 01:04:03,041
I WOKE UP WAY TOO EARLY.
FIVE MORE MINUTES.

47
01:04:04,625 --> 01:04:07,750
- HAVE YOU BEEN HERE ALL NIGHT?
THIS IS A LIBRARY, YOU KNOW.

48
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:09,625
- UH-HUH.

49
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:12,458
THAT MEANS THIS PLACE
IS CLOSED RIGHT NOW.

50
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:15,333
- OH, OKAY. I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING THEN. G'NIGHT.

51
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,500
- NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

52
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:20,708
- ( Ryner snoring )

53
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:25,000
ROLAND'S MOST POWERFUL MAGICIAN,

54
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:28,416
THE BLACK-HAIRED DEVIL,
RYNER LUTE.

55
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:31,666
SURELY NOT.

56
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:36,583
- ( students grunting )

57
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,166
- HEY, IT'S SION!
- WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

58
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:49,125
- ( groaning )

59
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:52,458
- WHAT WAS THAT?

60
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:53,458
- YOU FINALLY SHOW UP
FOR PRACTICE

61
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:54,583
AND THAT'S ALL
YOU'VE GOT FOR US?

62
01:04:54,666 --> 01:04:56,166
I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'D BOTHER

63
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:59,125
PUTTING IN AN APPEARANCE
AT ALL, RYNER.

64
01:04:59,208 --> 01:05:02,583
- Sion: SO THAT IS RYNER LUTE.

65
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:03,958
- COME ON, RYNER,

66
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:06,625
YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING!
NOBODY LOSES THAT EASILY!

67
01:05:06,708 --> 01:05:08,458
AND TO STAY DOWN THAT LONG

68
01:05:08,541 --> 01:05:09,583
WHEN YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY STILL
ABLE TO STAND,

69
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:11,000
IT'S JUST EMBARRASSING.

70
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:13,208
- I LIKE IT DOWN HERE.
- ON YOUR FEET!

71
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:16,250
I'M USING MY NEXT SPELL.
ARE YOU READY?

72
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:19,500
- NOPE.
- DON'T GIVE ME THAT!

73
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:22,000
WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER. IZUCHI!

74
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:23,666
- WITH MAGIC THAT SIMPLE...

75
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:32,875
- WHY DIDN'T YOU DEFLECT IT?
ARE YOU OKAY? RYNER?

76
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:36,208
HEY, THIS ISN'T FUNNY.
SAY SOMETHING!

77
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:39,541
- NO RESPONSE.
JUST A COLD, LIFELESS BODY.

78
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:44,291
I'M TIRED TODAY.

79
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:46,666
- YOU'RE ALWAYS TIRED!

80
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:49,208
- MAN, THIS GUY IS
A TOTAL WASTE OF SPACE.

81
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:50,875
THE ACADEMY SHOULD
JUST BOOT HIM.

82
01:05:50,958 --> 01:05:52,333
- I FEEL OUR CLASS
RANKS SLIPPING

83
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:54,375
JUST STANDING
THIS CLOSE TO HIM.

84
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:56,875
- COME ON, JUST LET ME
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

85
01:05:56,958 --> 01:05:58,750
- NEVER GONNA HAPPEN. UP.

86
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:03,750
I AM NOT LETTING YOU
SLACK OFF TODAY.

87
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:07,041
IF YOU DON'T SHOW THEM SOMETHING
SOON, YOU'LL GET HELD BACK.

88
01:06:07,125 --> 01:06:09,625
DO YOU WANT TO WATCH EVERYONE
ELSE GET PROMOTED ABOVE YOU?

89
01:06:09,708 --> 01:06:11,083
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY HOME?

90
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:13,583
- YEAH, LUTE! YOU'RE JUST MAKING
ALL OF US LOOK BAD HERE!

91
01:06:13,666 --> 01:06:16,083
- THAT'S ENOUGH.
EVERYBODY LEAVE HIM ALONE NOW.

92
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:23,166
THAT LAST HIT HE TOOK,
I SAW HIM.

93
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,416
- HEY. WHO'S MR. SILVER-HAIR?

94
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,750
- THAT'S SION ASTAL.
HE'S A NOBLE.

95
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:32,375
- UH, POOR GUY.

96
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:34,208
- YOU'RE KIEFER KNOLLES,
IS THAT RIGHT?

97
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:36,250
- UM, I AM. I HAVE TO SAY,

98
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:38,041
THOUGH, I'M SURPRISED
YOU KNOW MY NAME.

99
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:39,916
- WELL, I TRY TO MAKE
A MENTAL NOTE OF ALL

100
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,875
THE EXCELLENT STUDENTS
HERE AT THE ACADEMY.

101
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:44,000
- OH! THANK YOU!

102
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,166
- YOU HAVE ABOVE AVERAGE GRADES

103
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:47,083
IN EVERY SINGLE COURSE
YOU TAKE, KIEFER.

104
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:49,041
YOU'RE POSITIVE,
ATTRACTIVE, POPULAR,

105
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:50,166
WHY WOULDN'T I NOTICE YOU?

106
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:52,208
- ATTRACTIVE?
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT!

107
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:54,250
- ME EITHER.

108
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:57,375
- ANYHOW, I HAVE A PROPOSAL.

109
01:06:57,458 --> 01:07:00,833
TELL ME, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
ABOUT JOINING MY COMBAT TEAM?

110
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,541
- SERIOUSLY?

111
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:03,625
- THEY'LL BE HAVING US
FORM GROUPS

112
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:05,958
FOR MOCK BATTLE
TRAINING PRETTY SOON.

113
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:07,833
AND I THINK WE MIGHT
WORK WELL TOGETHER.

114
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:09,541
WHAT DO YOU SAY? YOU IN?

115
01:07:10,916 --> 01:07:12,083
- I DON'T KNOW.

116
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:14,541
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
JUST TELL HIM YOU'RE IN.

117
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:16,916
THEN I CAN HAVE
MY AFTERNOON NAPS BACK.

118
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
- NO, RYNER.
I WANT YOU THERE AS WELL.

119
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:23,333
- UH, YEAH, SOUNDS LIKE
A PAIN IN THE ASS TO ME.

120
01:07:23,416 --> 01:07:25,208
- IDIOT! IF WE'RE
ON SION'S TEAM,

121
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,250
THEN WE'RE SURE
TO GET PROMOTED!

122
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:28,916
- WHY WOULD I CARE ABOUT THAT?

123
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,583
AND WHY WOULD HE WANT
TO DRAFT ME, HUH?

124
01:07:30,666 --> 01:07:32,833
I'M SURE HE KNOWS
WHAT MY GRADES ARE.

125
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:35,666
OBVIOUSLY HE WANTS YOU.
I'M JUST INCENTIVE.

126
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,791
- SO, WHAT?

127
01:07:37,875 --> 01:07:40,041
YOU DON'T EVEN CARE IF I JOIN
HIS TEAM AND WE GET SEPARATED?

128
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:41,666
- LOOK, RYNER.

129
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:45,041
YOU'RE NOT A CONSOLATION PRIZE.
I WANT YOU ON MY SIDE.

130
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:46,833
- HUH? BUT WHY?

131
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:48,541
- IF YOU MUST KNOW,

132
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:50,666
I'VE TAKEN QUITE A LIKING
TO YOUR EYES.

133
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:52,000
- UHH...

134
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:53,958
- ( bell tolls )

135
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:57,083
- NO WAY. WITH A REASON
LIKE THAT, YOU CAN COUNT ME OUT.

136
01:07:57,166 --> 01:08:02,000
AND ANYWAY, I AM BEAT FROM
ALL THIS PRACTICE. SEE YA.

137
01:08:04,208 --> 01:08:06,166
- HEY, DON'T TAKE IT
THE WRONG WAY.

138
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,541
I LIKE YOUR EYES,
THAT'S ALL I SAID,

139
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:10,208
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

140
01:08:10,291 --> 01:08:12,958
I WANT THE BEARER OF
THE ALPHA STIGMA ON MY TEAM.

141
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,875
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

142
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:20,083
- DON'T BE MODEST. I'VE DONE
A GREAT DEAL OF RESEARCH.

143
01:08:20,166 --> 01:08:21,958
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU.

144
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:23,500
- LOOK, NO THANKS.

145
01:08:23,583 --> 01:08:26,166
FOLLOWING SOMEONE ELSE'S ORDERS
ISN'T REALLY MY STYLE? OKAY?

146
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:31,041
- IF YOU DON'T JOIN ME,
I'LL EXPOSE YOU.

147
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:34,458
EVERYONE WILL KNOW
YOU'RE AN ALPHA STIGMA...

148
01:08:34,541 --> 01:08:35,833
RYNER LUTE.

149
01:08:38,541 --> 01:08:42,208
- YOU'RE SURE YOU WANT THAT
MONSTER UNDER YOUR COMMAND, SIR?

150
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:46,166
- IF HE CAN TAME THOSE EYES.
THAT'S A BIG 'IF,' THOUGH.

151
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,375
- WELL, I'M SURE YOU'LL
TAKE CARE WITH HIM, THEN.

152
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,916
HERE ARE THE
BATTLE-TRAINING COMMAND

153
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,833
REQUISITION FORMS FOR THEM.

154
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:55,166
- THANK YOU, ROLL.
THESE ARE PERFECT.

155
01:08:57,541 --> 01:09:00,083
WE HAVE FOUR HOURS
TO ELIMINATE OUR ENEMY.

156
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:01,500
- ( students exclaims )

157
01:09:01,583 --> 01:09:03,833
- Tony: HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
FIND THEM OUT HERE?

158
01:09:03,916 --> 01:09:06,375
- Sion: DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

159
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:08,291
- Fahle: YOU DO? HOW?

160
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:10,375
- WHEN I HEARD OUR ASSIGNMENT,
I DID SOME RESEARCH.

161
01:09:10,458 --> 01:09:12,375
THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE
THEY COULD BE HEADED,

162
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:13,708
SO WE'LL AMBUSH THEM THERE.

163
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:15,916
- ISN'T IT LIKE CHEATING
IF WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE?

164
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,458
- ARMING YOURSELF WITH AS MUCH
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ENEMY

165
01:09:18,541 --> 01:09:20,125
AS POSSIBLE ISN'T CHEATING.

166
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:22,625
- HOW ABOUT LOOKING UP SECRETS
FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S PASTS

167
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:24,166
AND USING IT AS BLACKMAIL?

168
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:26,291
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- OH, NOTHING.

169
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:27,916
- JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

170
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,958
- GUYS, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THIS BATTLE.

171
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:32,250
JUST STICK WITH SION
AND YOU'RE GUARANTEED A WIN.

172
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:34,750
- IN WAR, INFORMATION
IS ALL THAT MATTERS.

173
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:36,833
AND USING INFORMATION
TO YOUR ADVANTAGE IS

174
01:09:36,916 --> 01:09:39,375
THE SUREST WAY TO VICTORY.

175
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:41,333
- DEPENDS WHAT YOU CONSIDER--

176
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:44,125
- BINGO.

177
01:09:44,208 --> 01:09:46,166
- Tahile: GOOD. LOOKS LIKE
THEY HAVEN'T REALIZED

178
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:47,208
WE'RE RIGHT ON TOP OF THEM.

179
01:09:47,291 --> 01:09:49,291
- OR WE COULD BE
WALKING INTO A TRAP.

180
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:51,458
- YOU'VE GOT A PLAN, DON'T YOU?

181
01:09:51,541 --> 01:09:54,458
- WE END THEM. WITH ONE SWIPE.

182
01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:56,416
- LET'S DO THIS.
- YEAH.

183
01:09:57,791 --> 01:09:59,958
- COME ON, RYNER! HERE WE GO!

184
01:10:01,083 --> 01:10:03,458
- ( Ryner exclaiming )

185
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:09,625
- WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER!
IZUCHI!

186
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:18,625
- Tahile: A TOAST!
TO OUR FIRST VICTORY!

187
01:10:18,708 --> 01:10:21,000
- Tony: EVERYTHING WENT
JUST LIKE SION PLANNED!

188
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:22,791
- YEAH.
- SEE? I TOLD YOU!

189
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:24,500
PUT YOUR FAITH IN LORD SION!

190
01:10:24,583 --> 01:10:27,625
- I'M JUST SURPRISED
WE FOUND THEM SO EASILY.

191
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:29,375
- Tahile: THEY'RE THE ONES
WHO WERE SURPRISED.

192
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:31,833
AND NONE TOO HAPPY ABOUT IT!
POOR SAPS.

193
01:10:31,916 --> 01:10:33,458
- Tony: DID YOU SEE THEIR FACES?

194
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:35,750
- YEP! I'M STICKING
WITH SION FOR LIFE!

195
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:38,208
- ( students chattering
excitedly )

196
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,833
- MIND IF I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

197
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:55,500
WHY DID YOU DECIDE
TO JOIN THIS ACADEMY?

198
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:56,833
- DON'T YOU KNOW?

199
01:10:56,916 --> 01:10:58,791
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME BY NOW.

200
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:00,333
- I KNOW A LOT.

201
01:11:00,416 --> 01:11:03,250
ROLAND SPECIAL INSTITUTE
NUMBER 307,

202
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:06,416
THAT'S THE ORPHANAGE
YOU GREW UP IN.

203
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:09,375
OFFICIALLY, IT WAS AN
INSTITUTION TO RAISE CHILDREN

204
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:12,291
WHO LOST THEIR FAMILIES
IN THE WAR.

205
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:15,833
BUT IN REALITY, IT WAS
A INTERNMENT CAMP FOR ORPHANS.

206
01:11:15,916 --> 01:11:18,583
THOSE WITH NO TALENT
WERE DISPOSED OF.

207
01:11:18,666 --> 01:11:21,375
THOSE DEEMED USEFUL WERE
SOLD INTO NOBLE FAMILIES

208
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:24,083
OR SHOVED
TO THE FRONT LINES.

209
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:26,166
THEN THE WAR ENDED.

210
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:30,041
WITH NO MORE DEMAND FOR SOLDIERS
THE INSTITUTE WAS DISMANTLED,

211
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:33,041
AND THE ORPHANS WHO REMAINED
WERE GIVEN A CHOICE.

212
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:36,208
RELOCATE UNDER MILITARY COMMAND.

213
01:11:36,291 --> 01:11:39,208
OR BE SILENCED IN THE MOST
PERMANENT WAY POSSIBLE.

214
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:41,333
NOT MUCH OF A CHOICE, REALLY.

215
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:43,791
SO YOU JOINED THE ROYAL
SPECIAL MILITARY ACADEMY.

216
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:47,583
BUT TELL ME, RYNER.
- WHAT NOW?

217
01:11:47,666 --> 01:11:51,541
- HONESTLY, DON'T YOU DREAM
OF GETTING REVENGE

218
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:52,791
AGAINST THIS COUNTRY?

219
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:54,708
- WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

220
01:11:54,791 --> 01:11:57,166
- HAVEN'T YOU EVER CONTEMPLATED
THE JOY OF CRUSHING

221
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:59,750
THIS CORRUPT GOVERNMENT
AND ALL IT STANDS FOR.

222
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:03,625
THIS LAND THAT SHUNS YOU JUST
FOR BEING BORN AN ALPHA STIGMA.

223
01:12:03,708 --> 01:12:06,250
THIS FOOLISH KINGDOM THAT
OPPRESSES THE WEAK AND

224
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:08,000
FIGHTS ITS POINTLESS WARS

225
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:10,625
WHILE THE NOBLES IT PROTECTS
DO NOTHING AT ALL.

226
01:12:10,708 --> 01:12:12,250
- HEY, COME ON, YOU KNOW
YOU COULD GET EXECUTED

227
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:13,583
JUST FOR SAYING THAT, DON'T YOU?

228
01:12:13,666 --> 01:12:16,208
- MAYBE. BUT YOU HATE
THIS COUNTRY TOO.

229
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:18,958
SO I KNOW
YOU WON'T TURN ME IN.

230
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:21,250
- HATRED TAKES
WAY TOO MUCH ENERGY.

231
01:12:21,333 --> 01:12:24,166
- AND YET YOU CAN'T HIDE
THE FACT THAT YOU STILL FEEL IT.

232
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:26,875
- YOU'RE TELLING ME WHAT I FEEL?

233
01:12:26,958 --> 01:12:30,041
- I'M GOING TO DO IT. I WILL.

234
01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:31,875
I'LL BE KING OF
THIS LAND SOMEDAY,

235
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:33,666
AND I'LL CHANGE
EVERYTHING.

236
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:37,208
I'LL CREATE THE PEACEFUL WORLD
YOU'VE ALWAYS DREAMT ABOUT.

237
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:41,000
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS WANT TO BE PART OF IT.

238
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,875
- SORRY, I THINK I'LL PASS.

239
01:12:51,958 --> 01:12:54,750
BUT IF YOU DO BECOME KING,
DO ME A FAVOR, WOULD YOU?

240
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:57,833
COME UP WITH A LAW THAT REWARDS
PEOPLE WHO TAKE A LOT OF NAPS.

241
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:01,541
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

242
01:13:01,625 --> 01:13:04,625
- ( laughs ) YOU'RE FUNNY.

243
01:13:04,708 --> 01:13:06,250
MAYBE YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR
IS WHY I WANT YOU

244
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:07,958
ON MY TEAM SO BADLY.

245
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:10,958
NOT THE ALPHA STIGMA AFTER ALL.

246
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:14,083
RUN, RYNER.
- WHO'RE THEY?

247
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:16,125
- THEY WANT ME. YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

248
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:19,583
- OH, OKAY THEN.
YOU HAVE FUN WITH THAT!

249
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:23,000
- COME ON!
YOU COULD SHOW A LITTLE CONCER--

250
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:24,375
- HEY! IF YOU'RE STRONG
ENOUGH TO BE KING,

251
01:13:24,458 --> 01:13:26,791
A WEAK ATTACK LIKE THIS
SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM.

252
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:30,541
- WELL, HE DOES HAVE A POINT.
THIS ATTACK IS PRETTY WEAK.

253
01:13:59,791 --> 01:14:02,458
I WON'T BE KILLED
BY AN ATTEMPT THIS PATHETIC.

254
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:07,583
I WON'T DIE HERE.
I WILL BECOME KING.

255
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:10,333
- Black knight: I SEEK
THE DESTRUCTIVE RAINBOW. KUURI!

256
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:18,333
- DANGO?

257
01:14:18,416 --> 01:14:20,166
- CRIMINAL MISCONDUCT
IS FORBIDDEN HERE.

258
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:21,875
MY BROTHER HAS
ENTRUSTED THE ENFORCEMENT

259
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,666
OF THIS DIRECTIVE TO ME.

260
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:27,000
SO STOP,
OR I WILL HAVE TO KILL YOU.

261
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,375
YOU REFUSE TO DESIST?
THEN YOU DIE.

262
01:14:34,041 --> 01:14:35,500
- FOOL!

263
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:43,500
- WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER!
IZUCHI!

264
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:49,500
- ( black knights screaming )

265
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:00,750
- THEY SAY IF YOU RESCUE A DOG,

266
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:03,208
IT WILL NEVER FORGET THE DEED
YOU PERFORMED FOR IT.

267
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:04,583
- A DOG?

268
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:07,083
- A GOOD DOG WOULD REMEMBER
HIS DEBT TO HIS SAVIOR.

269
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:10,000
AND MAKE VERY SURE TO BUY HER
A NUMBER 4 COMBO SET

270
01:15:10,083 --> 01:15:11,625
FROM THE WYNNIT DANGO SHOP.

271
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:14,125
AND HAVE IT DELIVERED
TO HER PLACE OF RESIDENCE.

272
01:15:15,083 --> 01:15:16,250
- HERE YOU GO.

273
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:18,833
THE LOVELY LADY TOLD ME
TO EXPECT YOU.

274
01:15:18,916 --> 01:15:22,083
THE ERIS FAMILY LIVES
JUST UP THE ROAD.

275
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:26,958
- SHE BELONGS
TO THE ERIS FAMILY.

276
01:15:27,041 --> 01:15:29,625
WHY WOULD SOMEONE FROM
A DISTINGUISHED SWORD CLAN

277
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:32,166
APPOINTED WITH GUARDING
THE ROLAND ROYAL FAMILY

278
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:33,500
RESCUE ME?

279
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:37,833
- MR. SION ASTAL
HAS ARRIVED, SIR.

280
01:15:37,916 --> 01:15:40,708
- NO NEED FOR ME.
I'VE LEFT THIS ONE TO MY SISTER.

281
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:44,333
- Ferris: MY BROTHER
HAS GIVEN ME A TASK.

282
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:46,416
I AM TO ENSURE YOUR SAFETY.

283
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,708
- Sion: ( laughs ) ARE YOU?
AND WHY IS THAT?

284
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:52,666
- MY BROTHER NEED NOT
EXPLAIN HIS ORDERS.

285
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:55,583
TELL ME WHY YOU'RE
BEING TARGETED.

286
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:59,166
- WELL, ALL RIGHT, I--

287
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:00,708
IT COULD TAKE A WHILE
TO EXPLAIN,

288
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:02,416
ARE YOU SURE
YOU HAVE THE TIME?

289
01:16:03,541 --> 01:16:06,416
MY MOTHER WAS
JUST A LOWLY COMMONER.

290
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,541
MY FATHER,
A PHILANDERING NOBLEMAN.

291
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:13,416
SO NATURALLY, MINE WAS
AN UNWANTED BIRTH.

292
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:17,708
I WAS SEPARATED FROM MY FATHER
WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG.

293
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:21,583
THOUGH MY MOTHER DID HER BEST,
AND RAISED ME WITH LOVE,

294
01:16:21,666 --> 01:16:24,541
I ENDURED RELENTLESS BULLYING.

295
01:16:24,625 --> 01:16:26,500
AND WHEN SHE DIED,

296
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:29,000
THERE WAS NO ONE
TO PROTECT ME ANYMORE.

297
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:33,916
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,
MY PATERNAL HALF BROTHERS

298
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,125
ALL SEETHE WITH AN ESPECIALLY
BITTER HATRED FOR ME.

299
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:39,750
IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THEM
WHO TRIED TO KILL ME,

300
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:41,666
THOUGH I HAVE NO PROOF OF THAT.

301
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:44,458
- I UNDERSTAND.

302
01:16:44,541 --> 01:16:46,666
- I WANT TO KNOW FOR SURE
WHO'S BEHIND THIS.

303
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:48,833
I WANT WHOEVER IS TRYING
TO KILL ME PINNED DOWN

304
01:16:48,916 --> 01:16:50,041
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

305
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:52,250
CAN I ASK YOU
TO HELP ME ACCOMPLISH THAT?

306
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:56,958
- I WILL TRY. OTHERWISE MY
BROTHER WILL PROBABLY KILL ME.

307
01:16:57,041 --> 01:17:00,666
I'LL NEED TO HIRE SOMEONE.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME.

308
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:01,791
- GOOD.

309
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:04,125
THEN STARTING TOMORROW,

310
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:06,750
I'LL NEED TWO SPECIALTY DANGO
SETS FOR ME AND MY HENCHMAN.

311
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:07,958
- SURE.

312
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,416
ARE YOU SURE I CAN'T
SPEAK WITH YOUR BROTHER?

313
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:15,000
- NOT TODAY. WHEN HE WANTS
TO MEET YOU HE'LL COME TO YOU.

314
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:18,166
- WHO IS THIS?

315
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:21,083
- A NEW DELIVERY BOY
FOR THE WYNNIT DANGO SHOP.

316
01:17:21,166 --> 01:17:22,416
IRIS, GUESS WHAT?

317
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,583
STARTING TOMORROW
YOU'RE GOING TO BE MY HENCHMAN.

318
01:17:24,666 --> 01:17:25,875
- ( exclaims ) YAY!

319
01:17:25,958 --> 01:17:28,041
I PROMISE YOU WON'T
REGRET GIVING ME A CHANCE!

320
01:17:28,125 --> 01:17:30,333
I'LL WORK REALLY HARD AND
PRETTY SOON YOU WON'T KNOW

321
01:17:30,416 --> 01:17:32,375
WHAT YOU EVER DID WITHOUT ME,
I JUST KNOW IT!

322
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:33,541
- Kiefer: IT'S AFTERNOON!

323
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:35,541
HOW LONG ARE YOU
PLANNING TO SLEEP?

324
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:37,250
- ( sighs ) AS LONG AS I CAN.

325
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:39,916
- AT LEAST HAVE SOME LUNCH.
MAYBE IT'LL GIVE YOU ENERGY.

326
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,125
- SHE MAKES HIM LUNCH
AND THAT'S ALL HE CAN SAY?

327
01:17:42,208 --> 01:17:43,583
- THAT LUCKY BASTARD!

328
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:45,250
- YEAH. I HOPE HE ROTS IN HELL!

329
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:50,708
- IS SION ABSENT AGAIN TODAY?
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT GUY?

330
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:53,000
- SO, WHAT COMES NEXT?

331
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:56,083
- Ferris: WE MAKE DIRECT CONTACT
WITH THE GUY IN CHARGE.

332
01:17:56,166 --> 01:17:58,416
BUT I'VE NOTICED SOMETHING.
- OH? WHAT?

333
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,750
- PEOPLE IN THE CASTLE
ARE ALL WORKED UP.

334
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:04,416
THE COMINGS AND GOINGS HAVE BEEN
MORE HECTIC THE PAST FEW DAYS.

335
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,875
- I SEE.
- IT'S OKAY.

336
01:18:05,958 --> 01:18:08,666
IT'S BETTER FOR COVERT MOVEMENT.

337
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:11,833
- GOOD. THEN I'LL BE WAITING
FOR YOUR REPORT.

338
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:20,416
- Roll: SION, SIR!
- WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S WRONG?

339
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,083
- IT'S STARTED,
THEY'RE ATTACKING US!

340
01:18:22,166 --> 01:18:23,875
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE.

341
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:27,208
- ( students chattering )
- BE QUIET!

342
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:30,250
- ( cries) I'M NOT READY TO DIE!

343
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:33,083
- TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED, ROLL.
- YES SIR.

344
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:35,041
ALL WE KNOW IS THAT
THE KINGDOM OF ESTABUL

345
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:37,500
HAS BEEN INVADING OUR
TERRITORY FROM THE SOUTH.

346
01:18:37,583 --> 01:18:39,791
WHICH MEANS THAT
ANOTHER WAR HAS BROKEN OUT.

347
01:18:40,541 --> 01:18:41,916
- OH NO.

348
01:18:45,416 --> 01:18:47,750
- Roll: THIS YEAR ESTABUL HAD
A LONG RAINY SEASON,

349
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:49,208
AND THEIR MAIN RIVER FLOODED.

350
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:51,166
TOO MANY FARMERS' CROPS
WERE AFFECTED

351
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:52,958
AND THERE WAS
A FOOD SHORTAGE.

352
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:55,750
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO OVERCOME
THE CRISIS BY HIRING SOLDIERS

353
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:58,000
AND INVADING
THE NEIGHBORING LANDS.

354
01:18:58,083 --> 01:19:00,458
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE ATTACKING US.

355
01:19:00,541 --> 01:19:03,083
- Sion: WAR...
WAR IS STARTING AGAIN.

356
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:06,541
ANOTHER SENSELESS CONFLICT.

357
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,625
THESE INCOMPETENT KINGS!

358
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:14,333
CAN THEY DO NOTHING BUT RISK
LIVES AND DESTROY EVERYTHING?

359
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,416
- Officer: ATTENTION, SOLDIERS!

360
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,541
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM,
REPORT TO DISPATCH!

361
01:19:18,625 --> 01:19:21,250
ALL ABLE STUDENTS ARE
BEING SENT TO THE FRONT LINE.

362
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:28,541
- SO DAMN QUIET.

363
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:30,708
BUT I GUESS
THERE'S NO SURPRISE THERE.

364
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:32,750
I'LL JUST SLEEP
TILL WE HEAD OUT.

365
01:19:37,041 --> 01:19:39,291
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

366
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:41,041
HOW CAN YOU BE
SO CALM WITH EVERYTHING

367
01:19:41,125 --> 01:19:42,541
THAT'S GOING ON AROUND YOU?

368
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:44,958
THE THOUGHT OF EVERYONE I KNOW
DYING ON THE BATTLEFIELD

369
01:19:45,041 --> 01:19:46,583
TERRIFIES ME.

370
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:48,291
THEY'RE ALL SO YOUNG.

371
01:19:48,375 --> 01:19:49,708
AND THERE'S YOU.

372
01:19:49,791 --> 01:19:52,041
YOU'RE THE PERSON
I'M MOST AFRAID FOR RIGHT NOW.

373
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:54,208
- WHY ARE YOU AFRAID FOR ME?

374
01:19:54,291 --> 01:19:56,166
- RUN. RYNER, PLEASE!

375
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:58,083
YOU HAVE TO
GET OUT OF HERE TODAY!

376
01:19:58,166 --> 01:20:00,125
IF YOU GO TO THE BATTLEFIELD,
YOU'LL DIE.

377
01:20:00,208 --> 01:20:02,750
DON'T ASK ME HOW I KNOW,
I JUST DO!

378
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:04,958
GET AWAY FROM THE ACADEMY
RIGHT NOW!

379
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:08,541
- LOOK, KIEFER.

380
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:11,166
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF DYING THAT EASILY.

381
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:13,416
I'LL BE OKAY, REALLY I WILL.

382
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:21,083
- Iris: WATER, WATER.
- Broph: NO! PLEASE, STOP!

383
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:23,916
I CAN'T BREATHE! NO MORE!
- MORE WATER. WATER, WATER.

384
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,208
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT!

385
01:20:25,291 --> 01:20:26,958
IF IT'S MONEY,
I CAN GET IT FOR YOU--

386
01:20:27,041 --> 01:20:30,541
- IRIS, THAT'S ENOUGH WATER.
LET'S MOVE ON TO NAILS.

387
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:33,166
- OKAY, SISTER! ( giggles )
- ( Brophs coughing )

388
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:35,958
- NAILS, NAILS!
- WAIT, PLEASE!

389
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:39,875
ANYTHING! I'LL DO ANYTHING!
- ALL RIGHT, THEN TELL ME,

390
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:42,125
WAS IT YOU WHO ORDERED
THE ATTACK ON SION ASTAL,

391
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:43,708
LORD BROPH, OR SOMEONE ELSE?

392
01:20:43,791 --> 01:20:47,166
SO THAT ASTAL BRAT WANTED
REVENGE AND HE SENT YOU.

393
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:50,708
( laughs) WELL, YOU'RE TOO LATE
TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

394
01:20:50,791 --> 01:20:52,125
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

395
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:54,375
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
SION IS IN DANGER?

396
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:56,375
- HE'S WALKING INTO A TRAP.

397
01:20:56,458 --> 01:20:58,500
THERE ARE FIFTY MAGIC
KNIGHTS FROM ESTABUL

398
01:20:58,583 --> 01:21:00,541
ASSEMBLED ON THE
ROXANNE PLAINS.

399
01:21:00,625 --> 01:21:04,166
RIGHT WHERE HE'S HEADING.
- Sion: YOU CAN ALL RELAX.

400
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:07,708
WE WON'T BE DYING IN THIS WAR.
NOT YET.

401
01:21:07,791 --> 01:21:10,041
I RECEIVED OUR ORDERS.

402
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:12,416
WE'VE BEEN DEPLOYED
TO THE ROXANNE PLAINS,

403
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:15,041
WHICH IS STRICTLY A
NON-COMBAT REGION AT THE MOMENT.

404
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:16,333
- Tahile: SEE, I TOLD YOU!

405
01:21:16,416 --> 01:21:19,000
STICK WITH SION AND
YOU'RE GUARANTEED A WIN!

406
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:22,208
- ( sighs ) SO, WE AREN'T GOING
TO DIE AFTER ALL.

407
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:24,833
- HEAR THAT, KIEFER?
WE'RE GONNA BE FINE!

408
01:21:24,916 --> 01:21:27,958
STOP LOOKING SO ANXIOUS.

409
01:21:28,041 --> 01:21:31,833
- Borphs: ( laughs ) ASTAL
THINKS HE'S LEADING HIS MEN

410
01:21:31,916 --> 01:21:33,708
TO A SAFE GROUND.

411
01:21:33,791 --> 01:21:36,750
BUT FIFTY MAGIC KNIGHTS
ARE WAITING THERE FOR THEM.

412
01:21:36,833 --> 01:21:38,875
WHAT A TRUSTING FOOL.

413
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:41,000
THINKS HE CAN BARE
HIS FANGS AT A PRINCE

414
01:21:41,083 --> 01:21:44,166
AND COME AWAY
WITHOUT A SCRATCH ON HIM.

415
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:46,166
THERE'S EVEN A SPY
IN HIS REGIMENT,

416
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:48,625
TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING
GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN.

417
01:21:48,708 --> 01:21:51,125
- MOVE IT!
NO DRAGGING YOUR FEET!

418
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:53,875
WE'VE GOTTA GET OVER
THIS MOUNTAIN BEFORE SUNRISE.

419
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:03,083
- Ryner: KIEFER?

420
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:08,333
- Officer: LET'S GO! BEFORE
ESTABUL CATCHES UP WITH US!

421
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:18,291
- ( theme song playing )

422
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:45,208
- Ryner: MARCHING FOR ESTABUL.
WUP-DEE-DOO.

423
01:23:45,291 --> 01:23:46,375
SERIOUSLY, WHAT'S
EVERYONE GOT AGAINST

424
01:23:46,458 --> 01:23:47,708
CATCHING A LITTLE SHUT-EYE?

425
01:23:47,791 --> 01:23:50,000
IT'S WAY BETTER THAN FIGHTING,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

426
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:52,416
IF YOU ASK ME, WAR SUCKS.

427
01:23:53,458 --> 01:23:55,125
REALLY SUCKS.
