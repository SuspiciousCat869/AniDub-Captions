1
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,666
- ( Brophs laughs )

2
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:29,708
ASTAL THINKS HE'S LEADING
HIS MEN TO A SAFE GROUND.

3
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:32,750
BUT FIFTY MAGIC KNIGHTS
ARE WAITING THERE FOR THEM.

4
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:34,000
HE'S A TRUSTING FOOL.

5
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:36,041
HE THINKS HE CAN BARE
HIS FANGS AT A PRINCE

6
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:38,375
AND COME AWAY WITHOUT
A SCRATCH, DOES HE?

7
01:00:41,916 --> 01:00:43,583
( groaning )

8
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:45,833
- YOU'RE A VERY, VERY SICK MAN!

9
01:00:45,916 --> 01:00:47,916
DON'T YOU DARE LAUGH AT
MY SISTER WITH THAT BRUTE LOOK

10
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,458
ON YOUR FACE! JERK!

11
01:00:50,541 --> 01:00:52,250
- THAT MEANS THE PRINCE...

12
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:56,958
BROTHER.

13
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:01,000
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, SISTER?

14
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:03,875
( mumbling ) I CAN'T BREA--

15
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:07,708
- ALWAYS PROTECTING HER,
AREN'T YOU?

16
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:11,583
FERRIS, JOBS SHOULD BE
FINISHED THOROUGHLY.

17
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:13,125
TO LET SUCH A PARASITE LIVE

18
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:15,041
WOULD SULLY THE
ERIS FAMILY NAME,

19
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:17,208
DON'T YOU THINK?
- WHAT'S YOUR END GAME?

20
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:19,041
IS THE PRINCE BEHIND THIS?

21
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:21,458
IS IT TRUE
THAT SION IS ALSO A PRINCE?

22
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:24,791
- THE ERIS FAMILY SERVES
ONLY THE KING OF ROLAND.

23
01:01:24,875 --> 01:01:27,000
THE TRUE KING.

24
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:28,666
- THE KING.

25
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,416
- WE MUST DISCERN
WHETHER YOUNG SION

26
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,291
WILL MAKE A SUITABLE RULER.

27
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:34,916
CAN HE, FOR INSTANCE,
SURVIVE A CONFRONTATION

28
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,333
WITH A TROOP OF
50 MAGIC KNIGHTS?

29
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:42,458
- IMPOSSIBLE.
- I COULD DO IT MYSELF, EASILY.

30
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:45,083
- SION ISN'T YOU.
- THAT IS TRUE.

31
01:01:45,166 --> 01:01:46,333
HE'S DEFINITELY NOT ME,

32
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:49,041
BUT THERE ARE UNTOLD DEPTHS
TO THE MAN YET.

33
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,875
FROM THE MOMENT
YOU AND SION MET,

34
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:55,625
YOU HAVE BEEN
SAVING HIS LIFE, SISTER.

35
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:57,583
DON'T YOU FIND THAT FASCINATING?

36
01:01:57,666 --> 01:01:59,583
- NOT PARTICULARLY, NO.

37
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:07,958
- ( theme song playing)

38
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:36,833
- Sion: ALL HANDS SHOULD BE
SETTING UP CAMP.

39
01:03:36,916 --> 01:03:39,041
WATER IS OUR FIRST PRIORITY.

40
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:41,833
EVERYONE ELSE,
TAKE CARE OF THE TENTS.

41
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:43,291
- I'LL TAKE WATER DUTY.

42
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:47,750
- Student: MAKE IT QUICK,
WOULD YA?

43
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:50,125
- HEY, YOU WANNA GET OFF YOUR
ASS AND LEND A HAND HERE?

44
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:52,583
- HUH? NO,
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A PAIN.

45
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:54,041
- HEY, KIEFER!

46
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:55,375
WOULD YOU TALK TO YOUR BUDDY
RYNER HERE, HE'S USELESS.

47
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:56,625
- OH, MY STOMACH, AH.

48
01:03:58,875 --> 01:04:01,291
- OH, I'M SORRY.
I WASN'T LISTENING.

49
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:02,166
- ( chuckles ) WE NEED YOU.

50
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,708
THERE'S A LAZY BUM OVER THERE

51
01:04:03,791 --> 01:04:06,375
WHO SAYS HE'S NOT GONNA LIFT
A FINGER TO HELP US SET UP CAMP.

52
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:07,958
- YOU KNOW RYNER WILL ONLY
LISTEN TO YOU,

53
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:09,791
WILL YOU TALK
TO HIM FOR US?

54
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,625
- ( grunting )

55
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:17,083
- TALK, YOU. TELL US
WHAT THE HELL YOU DID TO KIEFER.

56
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:18,666
- NOT A THING.

57
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:21,041
- WELL, SHE'S DEFINITELY NOT
HERSELF TODAY SO EXPLAIN THAT.

58
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:23,750
- COME ON, GUYS, WISE UP!

59
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:25,916
I MEAN, WE'RE ABOUT TO
FIGHT IN A WAR!

60
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,458
WHEN YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN

61
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:28,750
TO THE PERSON YOU LOVE,

62
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:30,625
OF COURSE YOU GET ANXIOUS.

63
01:04:30,708 --> 01:04:32,750
DID KIEFER SAY ANYTHING UNUSUAL
TO YOU THIS MORNING

64
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:34,333
BEFORE WE HEADED OUT?

65
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,500
- AND THERE'S YOU.

66
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:42,416
YOU'RE THE PERSON
I'M MOST AFRAID FOR.

67
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:46,166
- NICE!
- ( exclaims ) WHAT'S NICE?

68
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,166
- WELL, I'M OFF
TO FETCH SOME WATER NOW!

69
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,958
- AND FAHLE AND I ARE GONNA
HEAD INTO THE WOODS

70
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:51,916
TO FIND SOME FIREWOOD.

71
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,333
- WHAT ABOUT THE TENTS?

72
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:57,583
- YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT
WHILE WE'RE GONE, OKAY?

73
01:04:57,666 --> 01:05:00,750
- UH, SO! NICE WEATHER
WE'RE HAVING TODAY.

74
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:05,000
- GOOD LUCK, RYNER.
YOU'LL NEED IT.

75
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:09,125
- WHATEVER. I'M JUST GONNA LAY
HERE AND TAKE A GOOD LONG NAP.

76
01:05:18,166 --> 01:05:20,458
- RYNER.
- HMM?

77
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:24,541
- WOULD YOU RUN AWAY WITH ME?
IF I LEFT NOW?

78
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:28,458
WE... WE COULD JUST
RUN OFF TOGETHER.

79
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:31,958
FORGET ABOUT SION
AND STICK WITH ME INSTEAD.

80
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:33,625
- WHAT'S GOTTEN
INTO YOU, KIEFER?

81
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:36,458
- I JUST... I CARE ABOUT YOU.

82
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:39,083
I THINK I'VE ALWAYS
CARED ABOUT YOU.

83
01:05:39,166 --> 01:05:41,250
EVEN THOUGH I KNEW
IT WAS HOPELESS,

84
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:42,833
I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

85
01:05:44,416 --> 01:05:47,708
BUT YOU DON'T FEEL
THE SAME WAY, DO YOU?

86
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:55,458
- ( laughs ) OH!
YOU'RE JUST PULLING MY LEG!

87
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:57,791
YOU REALLY HAD ME GOING
FOR A SECOND THERE.

88
01:05:58,916 --> 01:06:00,791
- YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

89
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:02,583
IT IS PRETTY RIDICULOUS
FOR ME TO THINK

90
01:06:02,666 --> 01:06:04,083
THAT WE COULD
EVER HAVE ANYTHING.

91
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:06,125
- HEY, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

92
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:07,666
- I JUST COULDN'T FACE IT.

93
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:10,666
THE THOUGHT OF
YOU DYING OUT HERE LIKE THAT...

94
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:14,666
I'M SO SORRY,
I WANTED TO PROTECT YOU, RYNER.

95
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:18,875
BUT NOW I OFFER UP THIS CONTRACT

96
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:21,125
TO BEAR THE SPIRIT BEAST
OF LIGHT WHICH SLEEPS

97
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:22,958
WITHIN THE ATMOSPHERE!

98
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:29,166
GOODBYE, RYNER.

99
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:42,250
- TAHILE?

100
01:06:45,291 --> 01:06:46,791
- ( students clamoring )

101
01:06:53,541 --> 01:06:56,208
- MIGHT AS WELL NOT EVEN BOTHER
RUNNING, ROLAND SCUM!

102
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:59,291
- THINK YOU CAN ESCAPE
THE MAGIC KNIGHTS?

103
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:03,875
- WHAT'S HAPPENING? ROLL!

104
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:06,000
- AN ENEMY RAID BY ESTABUL, SIR!

105
01:07:06,083 --> 01:07:08,166
KNIGHTS IN RED ARMOR
ARE ATTACKING THE CAMP.

106
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:10,250
THEY SEEM TO BE COMING AT US
FROM EVERY ANG--

107
01:07:12,875 --> 01:07:14,916
- THEY'RE WEARING RED ARMOR.

108
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,958
THE MAGIC KNIGHTS OF ESTABUL!
ALL SOLDIERS RETREAT!

109
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:22,083
TAKE COVER IN THE WOODS.
FALL BACK AND REGROUP!

110
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,041
- Ryner: SION!

111
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:30,791
- THIS EVERYONE?
- YEAH. THEY GOT TAHILE.

112
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:33,291
HE WAS JUST ON HIS WAY
TO FETCH WATER FOR THE CAMP.

113
01:07:33,375 --> 01:07:35,791
HE WAS SO SURE IF WE STUCK
WITH YOU WE WERE SAFE,

114
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:37,000
HE WASN'T CAREFUL.

115
01:07:37,083 --> 01:07:40,458
- DAMN. AND KIEFER?
- NOT SURE ABOUT HER.

116
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:42,375
- I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST
IF WE SPLIT UP.

117
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:44,875
TONY, YOU AND FAHLE GO ON AHEAD.

118
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:47,041
WE'LL DO OUR BEST
TO HOLD THEM OFF HERE.

119
01:07:47,125 --> 01:07:49,875
- Fahle: SION!
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT US. NOW GO!

120
01:07:54,291 --> 01:07:57,958
THERE MAY STILL BE SURVIVORS,
INCLUDING KIEFER.

121
01:07:58,041 --> 01:08:00,208
- OH, AND YOU'RE GOING TO
SAVE THEM ALL, IS THAT IT?

122
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:02,125
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?

123
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:04,250
- SO IT WOULD SEEM.

124
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:07,750
DID YOU SEE THEM?
- NO

125
01:08:11,416 --> 01:08:15,250
- GO ON! LET'S SEE HOW FAST
YOU CAN RUN, YOU LITTLE BRATS!

126
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:20,166
- YEAH, IT'S NO FUN IF YOU JUST
STAND THERE AND WAIT FOR IT.

127
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:22,250
- READY? I OFFER UP
THIS CONTRACT

128
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:24,291
TO BEAR THE SPIRIT BEAST
OF LIGHT WHICH SLEEPS

129
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:25,916
WITHIN THE ATMOSPHERE!

130
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:29,833
- HE'S USING MAGIC TO GO FASTER!

131
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:33,875
I OFFER UP THIS CONTRACT

132
01:08:33,958 --> 01:08:36,083
TO BEAR THE SPIRIT BEAST
OF LIGHT WHICH SLEEPS

133
01:08:36,166 --> 01:08:37,625
WITHIN THE ATMOSPHERE!

134
01:08:42,166 --> 01:08:44,375
ARE YOU OKAY?
- YES.

135
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:46,666
THAT MAGIC, HOW DID YOU DO IT?

136
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,125
- YOU KNOW HOW I DID IT.

137
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:49,958
YOU ALSO KNOW I DIDN'T
WANT TO USE IT, THOUGH.

138
01:08:50,041 --> 01:08:52,500
DAMN IT!
- I WAS RIGHT, WASN'T I?

139
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:56,083
- YOU! HOW IS IT
THAT YOU KNOW OUR ESTABUL MAGIC?

140
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:57,666
- UNLESS YOU'RE--

141
01:08:57,750 --> 01:09:00,166
- YES! OF COURSE!
HE'S AN ALPHA STIGMA!

142
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:03,333
- THE EYES OF DESTRUCTION!
HE HAS THEM!

143
01:09:03,416 --> 01:09:07,291
- NO! I OFFER UP THIS CONTRACT
TO UNLEASH THE MAG--

144
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,416
- STOP! WE CAN'T USE
ANY MAGIC, FOOL!

145
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,458
- I OFFER UP THIS CONTRACT
TO UNLEASH THE MAGIC BEAST

146
01:09:12,541 --> 01:09:14,458
THAT DANCES THROUGH THE SKY!

147
01:09:17,416 --> 01:09:18,375
- ( both scream )

148
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:23,291
- YOU BASTARD!

149
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:24,791
IF YOU'D USED THAT POWER SOONER

150
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:26,791
NOBODY ELSE WOULD'VE HAD
TO DIE TODAY!

151
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:28,416
THERE WERE ONLY THREE
HERE THIS TIME,

152
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,750
THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALIVE.

153
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:31,458
I HAVEN'T USED THAT POWER
IN SEVEN YEARS.

154
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:32,916
I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

155
01:09:33,625 --> 01:09:37,291
- WHAT AN INTERESTING SHOW
YOU PUT ON FOR US.

156
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:44,666
RARE TO SEE A MONSTER LIKE THIS
IN ACTION.

157
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:55,583
THAT'S RIGHT, BOY,
COWER BEFORE ME,

158
01:09:55,666 --> 01:09:57,708
SO I CAN WATCH WHILE YOU SUFFER.

159
01:09:57,791 --> 01:10:03,250
YOU ARE THE ALPHA STIGMA, RIGHT?
SHOW ME ONE OF YOUR TRICKS.

160
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:07,625
OR DON'T YOU GET IT YET?
THESE ARE THE ONLY TWO LEFT.

161
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:11,833
WE KILLED THE REST.
EVERY ONE OF THEM.

162
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,291
- THEY'RE ALL DEAD?

163
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:27,625
- NO FIGHT IN YOU AFTER HEARING
THAT? WHERE'S YOUR SPIRIT?

164
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:28,916
HEY!

165
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:31,041
- ( groans )

166
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:37,750
- ( screaming ) No! No!

167
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:42,000
- Ryner: STOP. PLEASE. STOP!

168
01:10:42,083 --> 01:10:43,958
- Ryner's inner voice:
DEATH IS ALL AROUND YOU.

169
01:10:44,041 --> 01:10:46,666
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER, DOES IT?

170
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:48,958
- YOU'RE WRONG.
- AM I?

171
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:52,916
- YOU'RE WRONG!
- THE WORLD IS YOURS TO TAKE.

172
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,958
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS OPEN UP.
RELEASE IT AND KILL.

173
01:10:58,041 --> 01:10:59,833
- ( screaming )

174
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:04,583
- UNTIL EVERYTHING DISAPPEARS
BEFORE YOUR EYES.

175
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:12,166
- ( Reyner screams )

176
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:17,833
( laughs menacingly )

177
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:22,458
- WHAT'S WITH THIS GUY?
IS HE ASLEEP?

178
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,666
- WEAKLING. YOUR MOLECULES
WILL SCATTER LIKE SAND.

179
01:11:30,625 --> 01:11:34,208
- HE'S GONE. WHAT DID YOU DO?

180
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:39,458
- MONSTER. DEVIL. GOD. HERO.
CALL ME WHAT YOU WILL.

181
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:44,250
( laughs )

182
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:51,041
- MONSTER! I'LL FINISH YOU!

183
01:11:51,125 --> 01:11:53,958
I OFFER UP THIS CONTRACT
TO UNLEASH THE SPIRIT

184
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:55,916
WHICH ENVELOPS THE AIR!

185
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:07,250
- ANALYZE EXISTENCE.
AND RELEASE.

186
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:12,041
- HE'S A GOD. NO! PLEASE!

187
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:15,541
- FIRST COMES DESTRUCTION.
I CREATE NOTHING.

188
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:18,791
FORGIVE NOTHING. SAVE NOTHING.

189
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:22,125
I JUST ERASE. COMPLETELY.

190
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:29,958
- Knight: MONST--

191
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,625
- SHATTER. COLLAPSE.

192
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:37,958
BREAK. AND DISAPPEAR.

193
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:55,541
I FEEL IT.

194
01:12:56,583 --> 01:12:58,291
MY POWER.

195
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:00,833
THE CONTRACT IS DIFFERENT.

196
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:05,166
ERASE EVERYTHING.

197
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,583
- ( grunts) NO, RYNER.
PLEASE DON'T.

198
01:13:10,666 --> 01:13:12,875
- Sion: STOP THIS.
- YOU'RE DANGEROUS.

199
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:14,875
YOU HAVE TO DIE.

200
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:17,416
MY EYES! THEY'RE CLOSING!

201
01:13:18,666 --> 01:13:20,208
- PLEASE.

202
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:23,166
- NO.

203
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:26,000
DON'T CLOSE...

204
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:33,666
- CLOSE THEM!
- YOU ARE POWERLESS.

205
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:36,833
( groans )

206
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:39,625
- ( Kiefer sobs )

207
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:42,125
- RYNER! HEY!
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

208
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:44,375
RYNER!

209
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:51,125
- Ryner: NOT AGAIN.

210
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:54,500
- ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING )

211
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:57,458
- Sion: REINFORCEMENTS?

212
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:12,166
- Ryner: WHY?

213
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,708
- ( Kiefer continues crying )

214
01:14:16,166 --> 01:14:18,583
- ( people cheering )

215
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,916
- ( Reyner groans )

216
01:14:47,458 --> 01:14:49,666
- Militant: ALL RIGHT!

217
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:52,458
- ( scoffs ) Had enough,
monster?

218
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:54,666
- WISHING YOU HAD BEEN SMART
AND STAYED SHUT AWAY

219
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:56,833
IN THAT ACADEMY
LIKE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO?

220
01:14:56,916 --> 01:14:58,833
- IS KIEFER ALIVE?

221
01:14:58,916 --> 01:15:00,708
THAT'S ALL I REALLY WANNA KNOW.

222
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:03,041
- SHE'S A PRISONER HERE,
JUST LIKE YOU.

223
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:06,416
- AND WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT
SHE'D EVER COME BACK?

224
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:11,041
YEARS AGO HER OLDER SISTER WAS
KILLED IN AN INTELLIGENCE RAID.

225
01:15:11,125 --> 01:15:14,666
THE OTHER TWO WERE REEDUCATED
TO ENSURE LOYALTY TO ROLAND.

226
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:17,291
- WE DECIDED TO KEEP HER
YOUNGER SISTER TO MAKE SURE

227
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,958
SHE NEVER FORGOT HER TRAINING.

228
01:15:19,041 --> 01:15:21,583
- OKAY, WAIT A SECOND, WOULDN'T
IT JUST BE EASIER TO SAY

229
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:25,125
YOU TOOK HER YOUNGER SISTER
HOSTAGE OR SOMETHING?

230
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:27,291
- SHE'S JUST AS FOOLISH AS YOU.

231
01:15:27,375 --> 01:15:31,208
WE KILLED THE SISTER AGES AGO.
AND WHAT DID WE GET OUT OF HER?

232
01:15:31,291 --> 01:15:35,041
NOTHING. THE ASTAL BRAT LIVES,
AFTER ALL THAT.

233
01:15:35,125 --> 01:15:37,958
- OH, OKAY, SO HE WAS
YOUR TARGET ALL ALONG.

234
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:40,458
- AND DO YOU KNOW THE KIND OF
PEOPLE WE'RE IN TROUBLE WITH,

235
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:43,000
HAVING FAILED
TO ELIMINATE THAT TARGET?

236
01:15:43,083 --> 01:15:44,458
- IS THAT WHY
YOU'VE GOT ME IN HERE?

237
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:46,291
SO YOU'D HAVE SOMEONE WHINE
AND MOAN TO?

238
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:49,583
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH, MONSTER.

239
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:52,208
- ( Ryner groans )

240
01:15:52,291 --> 01:15:54,000
THAT ONE ACTUALLY
HURT A LITTLE BIT.

241
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:56,791
- ARE YOU MOCKING ME,
DO YOU DARE?

242
01:15:56,875 --> 01:15:58,750
- YOU'RE THE ONE
DOING THE MOCKING HERE.

243
01:15:58,833 --> 01:16:02,166
NOT THAT I'M NOT USED TO IT,
OF COURSE, I AM.

244
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:04,625
BUT STILL, I THINK I'VE HAD
ABOUT ENOUGH FOR TODAY.

245
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:06,166
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND PUT ME IN MY CELL

246
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:08,458
BEFORE I DROP DEAD OF MOCKERY?

247
01:16:08,541 --> 01:16:11,250
- IF YOU COME QUIETLY
AND DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE,

248
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:14,541
THE KING IS WILLING TO GRANT YOU
ONE REQUEST IN RETURN.

249
01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:20,083
- SURE IS TEMPTING TO ASK THAT
YOU STOP TORTURING ME.

250
01:16:20,166 --> 01:16:21,750
WAIT. HANG ON.

251
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,875
- ( gate opens )

252
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:30,458
- KIEFER.

253
01:16:30,541 --> 01:16:33,125
IF YOU KEEP TAKING AFTERNOON
NAPS, YOUR GRADES'LL DROP.

254
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:35,208
- WAIT, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

255
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:37,041
RYNER, WHAT'S GOING ON?

256
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:40,458
- UH, IT'S KINDA HARD
TO EXPLAIN. THIS PLACE S--

257
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:43,083
- IF YOU SAY THIS PLACE SUCKS,
I SWEAR I'M GOING TO PUNCH YOU.

258
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:44,666
- I WON'T SAY IT!

259
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:47,166
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIT ME, OKAY?
I JUST GOT THE BLEEDING TO STOP.

260
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:49,375
- YEAH, WHY ARE YOU
SO BANGED UP?

261
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:50,875
- FORGET ABOUT THAT FOR NOW.

262
01:16:50,958 --> 01:16:53,875
THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO
TELL YOU, AND IT ISN'T GOOD.

263
01:16:53,958 --> 01:16:56,958
YOUR LITTLE SISTER
ISN'T REALLY A HOSTAGE.

264
01:16:57,041 --> 01:16:59,500
KIEFER, THEY TOOK HER LIFE
A LONG TIME AGO.

265
01:17:02,833 --> 01:17:04,458
- HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT?

266
01:17:07,875 --> 01:17:10,041
I SEE! YOU'RE ANOTHER PAWN!

267
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:13,833
YOU'RE ONE OF THEM, TOO, AREN'T
YOU? THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON!

268
01:17:13,916 --> 01:17:15,791
HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT?

269
01:17:15,875 --> 01:17:18,750
HOW DARE YOU COME HERE AND
TELL ME MY SISTER IS DEAD?

270
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:21,083
YOU THINK I WANT TO HEAR
THAT FROM YOU?

271
01:17:21,166 --> 01:17:22,541
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN?

272
01:17:22,625 --> 01:17:25,000
HAVE YOU BEEN LAUGHING
ALL THIS TIME?

273
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:29,125
LIKE WHEN I TOLD YOU
THAT I CARED ABOUT YOU.

274
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:31,375
YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT
I WAS SUCH A FOOL!

275
01:17:33,458 --> 01:17:36,500
( cries ) THERE WAS ALWAYS
A POSSIBILITY SHE WASN'T ALIVE.

276
01:17:36,583 --> 01:17:40,125
I KNEW THAT.
BUT WHAT COULD I DO?

277
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:42,583
I COULDN'T BE SURE SO I...

278
01:17:44,375 --> 01:17:48,333
- WHY DO YOU THINK WE HAVE WARS?
I CERTAINLY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

279
01:17:48,416 --> 01:17:51,708
I'VE NEVER CARED WHO OWNS
THE LAND OR HAS ALL THE POWER.

280
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:53,375
YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT I DO CARE ABOUT,

281
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:56,333
HOW SOON DO I GET TO
TAKE MY NEXT NAP, THAT'S IT.

282
01:17:56,416 --> 01:17:59,791
TONY, TAHILE AND FAHLE LAID DOWN
THEIR LIVES FOR NOTHING.

283
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,666
- WHY ARE YOU SAYING THIS?

284
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,333
- THE PEOPLE WHO START
WARS ARE THE ONES

285
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:05,083
WHO WANT SOMETHING FROM IT.

286
01:18:05,166 --> 01:18:07,291
AND THE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER
ARE THE ONES THEY CON

287
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:08,750
INTO FIGHTING FOR THEM.

288
01:18:08,833 --> 01:18:11,083
SO THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY OUT.

289
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:14,541
UNLIKE SION,

290
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:16,791
I'VE NEVER HAD ANY REAL
INTEREST IN TRYING TO CHANGE

291
01:18:16,875 --> 01:18:19,083
THE WAY THINGS ARE DONE
IN THIS COUNTRY.

292
01:18:19,166 --> 01:18:21,333
I JUST WANT A QUIET PLACE
TO SLEEP THE DAY AWAY,

293
01:18:21,416 --> 01:18:22,541
SOMEWHERE WHERE I
CAN LIVE MY LIFE

294
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:25,000
WITHOUT HURTING
ANYBODY ELSE.

295
01:18:25,083 --> 01:18:27,458
MY HEAD! KIEFER.

296
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:29,750
WHAT KIND OF NONSENSE
HAVE I BEEN SPOUTING?

297
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:32,708
- Guard: ALMOST READY IN HERE?

298
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:36,625
- OH, RIGHT! I ALMOST FORGOT.
KIEFER, COME HERE A SECOND

299
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:37,833
- WHY?

300
01:18:37,916 --> 01:18:40,166
- JUST WATCH YOUR HEAD, OKAY?

301
01:18:42,708 --> 01:18:47,125
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR RELEASE
AND FOR MY IMPRISONMENT.

302
01:18:47,958 --> 01:18:49,416
- WHAT?

303
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,250
- ALL RIGHT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT THE TERMS OF YOUR REQUEST

304
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:52,416
HAVE BEEN MET?

305
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,500
- YEP. PERFECTLY. THANKS.
WE'RE DONE HERE.

306
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:56,708
- WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?
- Guard: MY ORDERS.

307
01:18:56,791 --> 01:18:59,083
I AM TO ENSURE THE RELEASE
OF KIEFER KNOLLES IN RETURN

308
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:01,958
FOR THE VOLUNTARY IMPRISONMENT
OF RYNER LUTE.

309
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:03,833
AND I HAVE TO SAY, MAN,

310
01:19:03,916 --> 01:19:05,750
YOU MUST BE SOME KINDA BADASS
TO MAKE DIRECT DEALS

311
01:19:05,833 --> 01:19:06,833
WITH THE MILITARY.

312
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:09,208
- NOT REALLY. NO. I WISH.

313
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:10,666
- WHY WOULD YOU AGREE
TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS

314
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:11,958
AFTER WHAT I DID?

315
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:14,500
I BETRAYED EVERYONE
IN OUR REGIMENT.

316
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,208
THEY'RE ALL DEAD NOW
BECAUSE OF ME!

317
01:19:17,291 --> 01:19:20,541
- PEOPLE DON'T KILL PEOPLE,
REALLY, MONSTERS DO.

318
01:19:20,625 --> 01:19:25,125
MONSTERS LIKE WAR, HUNGRY
NOBLES, AND GREEDY KINGDOMS.

319
01:19:26,333 --> 01:19:29,666
AND MONSTERS LIKE... LIKE ME.

320
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:33,083
NOT YOU, KIEFER.
THINK ABOUT IT.

321
01:19:33,166 --> 01:19:36,208
IN HERE, I CAN RULE ON HIGH
AS KING OF THE AFTERNOON NAPS.

322
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,375
AND YOU CAN BE FREE.

323
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:46,416
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

324
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,250
I WAS WRONG ABOUT
WHY I FELL FOR YOU, RYNER.

325
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:51,416
I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE
YOU WERE SO LAZY,

326
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,666
THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO TRY.

327
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:57,625
I COULD JUST BE MYSELF.
BUT I WAS WRONG.

328
01:19:57,708 --> 01:19:59,708
IT WAS BECAUSE YOU'RE KIND.

329
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:04,875
AND STRONG. SO STRONG.

330
01:20:04,958 --> 01:20:08,500
YOU'RE NO MONSTER.
I PROMISE YOU.

331
01:20:08,583 --> 01:20:10,666
NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK.

332
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:14,416
YOU SAVED ME AND I'LL--
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU.

333
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,625
SOMEDAY I'LL FIND A WAY TO--

334
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,041
I'M READY.

335
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:24,583
- Guard: COMING OUT.

336
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,333
- ( gates closing )

337
01:20:31,083 --> 01:20:33,500
- I'M GLAD THAT'S DONE.

338
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:36,541
I THOUGHT
SHE WOULD SUFFOCATE ME.

339
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,541
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
YOU'RE HURT.

340
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:44,541
- YEAH. ONLY A LITTLE.

341
01:20:44,625 --> 01:20:45,708
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING,

342
01:20:45,791 --> 01:20:48,166
VOLUNTEERING TO BE
IMPRISONED INDEFINITELY?

343
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:51,083
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS
FOR ME TO GET IN TO SEE YOU?

344
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:53,583
- YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE
BOTHERED, YOU KNOW.

345
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:55,208
THERE'S ACTUALLY NOT MUCH
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

346
01:20:55,291 --> 01:20:57,833
STAYING IN A PRISON CELL
AND GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

347
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:08,375
WHAT'S THIS?

348
01:21:08,458 --> 01:21:10,333
- TONIGHT AFTER DARK, A HORSE
WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU

349
01:21:10,416 --> 01:21:11,875
IN THE NORTHERN WOODS.

350
01:21:11,958 --> 01:21:14,916
- THAT WOULD MAKE YOU A SUSPECT,
IF I WERE TO TRY AND ESCAPE.

351
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,208
- NO ONE'S BOLD ENOUGH
TO INCARCERATE A WAR HERO

352
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:18,333
IN THIS POLITICAL CLIMATE.

353
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:20,041
- THIS KIND OF STUNT
COULD DO AWAY

354
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,083
WITH THAT 'HERO'
TITLE FOR GOOD.

355
01:21:22,166 --> 01:21:24,916
- I'VE DONE OKAY
FOR MYSELF SO FAR.

356
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,666
- THAT'S PRETTY BIG
TALK, THOUGH.

357
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:29,125
I MEAN, FOR SOMEONE
PEOPLE KEEP TRYING TO KILL.

358
01:21:29,208 --> 01:21:30,875
- PLEASE. RYNER.
THINK ABOUT THIS.

359
01:21:30,958 --> 01:21:33,750
IT MAYBE THE ONLY CHANCE
WE HAVE.

360
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:35,916
I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT
I'LL BE ABLE TO BRIBE MY WAY IN

361
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,291
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

362
01:21:37,375 --> 01:21:39,875
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

363
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:42,666
MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD.
WE'RE AT WAR AGAIN.

364
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:45,333
AND I'M NO CLOSER TO BEING KING.

365
01:21:45,416 --> 01:21:48,041
I'VE FAILED ON SO MANY LEVELS
UP TO THIS POINT.

366
01:21:54,041 --> 01:21:55,166
RYNER.

367
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,666
- ESCAPING'S A PAIN IN THE ASS.

368
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,750
BESIDES, WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN TO EITHER OF US

369
01:21:58,833 --> 01:22:00,791
IF WE ACTUALLY SUCCEEDED.

370
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:03,041
- BUT THINK... THINK ABOUT
WHAT THIS WOULD MEAN.

371
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:05,791
IT WOULD MEAN I GET ALL
THE AFTERNOON NAPS I WANT.

372
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:07,333
- WHAT DO NAPS ACCOMPLISH?

373
01:22:07,416 --> 01:22:10,625
- I'LL GET BACK TO YOU,
AFTER I GET A LITTLE SLEEP.

374
01:22:10,708 --> 01:22:12,125
- RYNER!

375
01:22:12,208 --> 01:22:14,250
- Guard: TIME'S UP.
ARE YOU READY TO GO, SIR?

376
01:22:18,666 --> 01:22:21,375
- WELL, I'VE GOTTA GET BACK
TO BEING LOCKED UP NOW.

377
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:22,750
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

378
01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:24,958
A ROOF AND THREE MEALS A DAY
ISN'T SUCH A RAW DEAL.

379
01:22:27,791 --> 01:22:29,250
GOOD LUCK, SION.

380
01:22:30,666 --> 01:22:33,500
- YES, YOU, TOO, FRIEND.

381
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:43,375
THIS IS IT.
I'VE LOST EVERYTHING.

382
01:22:45,041 --> 01:22:47,791
BUT I'LL NEVER LOSE
MY WAY AGAIN.

383
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:49,750
I PROMISE YOU THAT, RYNER.

384
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:02,958
- IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME,
ISN'T IT?

385
01:23:03,041 --> 01:23:06,125
WAR NEVER CHANGES.
IT ALWAYS SUCKS.

386
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:09,000
WHY WOULD ANYONE EVER CHOOSE
TO BE A PART OF ONE?

387
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:11,958
I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER BE ABLE
TO UNDERSTAND THOSE PEOPLE.

388
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:13,458
- Guard: LIGHTS OUT!

389
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:20,958
- GOTTA SAY, THIS WAS
A FULL DAY, ALL TOLD.

390
01:23:22,791 --> 01:23:25,125
GOOD BET TOMORROW
WON'T BE, THOUGH.

391
01:23:35,166 --> 01:23:37,583
OH, WELL,
SO I'VE GOT SOME FREE TIME.

392
01:23:37,666 --> 01:23:40,500
ALL THE FREE TIME
I COULD EVER ASK FOR.

393
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:47,666
- ( theme song playing )

394
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:13,875
- Ryner: YOU KNOW WHAT SUCKS?

395
01:25:13,958 --> 01:25:16,833
WORKING ALL DAY, STRUGGLING.

396
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:20,291
I FIGURED IF I JUST SLEPT,
NOTHING COULD GO WRONG.

397
01:25:20,375 --> 01:25:22,708
AND I WAS OKAY WITH THAT.

398
01:25:22,791 --> 01:25:24,500
BUT IT COULDN'T LAST.
