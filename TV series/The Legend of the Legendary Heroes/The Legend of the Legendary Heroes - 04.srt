1
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,041
- ( footsteps approaching )

2
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:33,958
- AH, EXCELLENT.
SO YOU SURVIVED, THEN.

3
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:37,583
- WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU, TOO.
IT SEEMS I'VE RETURNED A HERO.

4
01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:39,250
IF ONE HAS A MIND
TO PAY CREDENCE

5
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:41,000
TO RUMORS AND HEARSAY, THAT IS.

6
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:43,583
- I DON'T.
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

7
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:46,541
- A SUMMONS FROM HOUSE OF ERIS
IS IGNORED AT ONE'S PERIL.

8
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:50,125
- HE COMES AT MY BEHEST.

9
01:00:51,416 --> 01:00:52,583
- Ferris: BROTHER.

10
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:54,250
- I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE HAD
THE PLEASURE

11
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:56,416
OF A FORMAL
INTRODUCTION AS OF YET.

12
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:00,125
MY NAME IS LUCILE ERIS, I AM
THE HEAD OF THE ERIS FAMILY.

13
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:09,208
MY PURPOSE HERE IS SIMPLE.

14
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:10,583
I MERELY INTEND

15
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:13,166
TO SCRUTINIZE YOUR FEELINGS
AND JUDGE YOUR RESPONSE.

16
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,500
- FEELINGS?
TO WHAT END?

17
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:17,583
- I WILL ASK
A VOLLEY OF QUESTIONS.

18
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:20,041
EACH ONE AFTER ITS OWN MANNER
FOLLOWING THE SKEIN

19
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:21,875
OF A COMMON THREAD.

20
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:23,958
ANSWER SINCERELY.

21
01:01:24,041 --> 01:01:25,416
BEFORE WE PROCEED, HOWEVER,

22
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,625
I REQUIRE YOUR CONSENT
TO THE FOLLOWING CONDITION.

23
01:01:28,708 --> 01:01:32,666
SHOULD YOUR ANSWERS STRIKE ME
AS UNSUITABLE, I'LL KILL YOU.

24
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,208
- ( gasps )

25
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:37,041
- AS A COURTESY, THOUGH,
DEATH WILL COME QUICKLY.

26
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:40,208
THAT SPLENDID HEAD WILL SCARCELY
FEEL ITSELF LEAVING THE CRADLE

27
01:01:40,291 --> 01:01:41,583
OF YOUR SHOULDERS.

28
01:01:42,875 --> 01:01:46,125
JUDGING FROM YOUR FACE,
YOU ARE A BIT PUZZLED.

29
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:50,083
SEE, THE FORTUNES OF ROYALTY
ABIDE WITH THIS HOUSE.

30
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:55,083
- I UNDERSTAND.

31
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:57,416
THE ROYAL PROTECTORATE FAMILY
WOULD TEST THE FITNESS

32
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,958
OF ROLAND'S KING-TO-BE.

33
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:00,958
- Lucile: SUCH IS THE TRIAL
ALL DESCENDANTS OF THIS REALM'S

34
01:02:01,041 --> 01:02:03,833
FOUNDER MUST ENDURE
WHO SEEK TO ATTAIN THE THRONE.

35
01:02:03,916 --> 01:02:07,250
ESPECIALLY LOWBORN USURPERS
LIKE YOURSELF.

36
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:09,666
- OH? THEN I AGREE TO THE TEST.

37
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:12,166
ASK OF ME WHATEVER YOU DESIRE.

38
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:15,416
- GOOD. I DIDN'T ANTICIPATE
YOU'D RESIST.

39
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,291
COME WITH ME, PLEASE.

40
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:21,583
- YOU WOULD BRAVE THE HORRORS
OF BATTLE ONLY TO FORFEIT

41
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:23,416
YOUR LIFE IN CLOSE QUARTERS?

42
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:27,500
- MY LIFE WAS FORFEIT LONG AGO.

43
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,458
- ( theme song playing )

44
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:08,875
- ( kids laughing )

45
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:19,041
- STAND ASIDE! EVERYONE CLEAR
A PATH FOR HIS LORDSHIP!

46
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:21,750
- ( people chattering )

47
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,208
- SO I DON'T IMAGINE
YOU'LL BE HOME EARLY, HUH?

48
01:04:33,291 --> 01:04:35,541
- BELIEVE ME, I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I'VE GOT TO STICK AROUND

49
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:36,750
AND MAKE THE SURE
THE NEW PRISONER

50
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:38,083
GETS SETTLED IN RIGHT TODAY.

51
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:39,708
- NATURALLY.

52
01:04:39,791 --> 01:04:40,708
NO MATTER WHAT HE DID,

53
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:42,375
IT'S A PITY HE
WOUND UP IN THERE.

54
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:44,416
- Guard: YOU SAID IT.
STEP THROUGH THOSE DOORS

55
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,625
AND A BODY CAN BID THE SUN
A FOND FARE-THEE-WELL...

56
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:49,541
UNTIL THEIR DYING DAY.

57
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:53,458
- HOW OLD IS HE?
- YOUNG YET. NOT EVEN TWENTY.

58
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:56,916
- Ryner: GUARD?
HEY, GUARD?

59
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,375
- Guard: GOOD MORNING.

60
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:02,125
SO, WHAT'LL I HAVE
THE PLEASURE OF FETCHING

61
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:03,833
FOR OUR ESTEEMED GUEST TODAY,

62
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:06,333
A GOOSE DOWN PILLOW?
AN ERMINE LINED CLOAK?

63
01:05:08,458 --> 01:05:09,583
- I'M GOOD.

64
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:11,416
- SERIOUSLY, SO LONG
AS IT'S WITHIN REASON,

65
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,000
YOU SHOULD JUST
FEEL FREE TO ASK.

66
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:15,708
- PAPER AND PENCIL THEN.

67
01:05:15,791 --> 01:05:17,083
AND YOU'RE FAMILIAR
WITH THE ROYAL SPECIAL

68
01:05:17,166 --> 01:05:18,625
MILITARY ACADEMY, RIGHT?

69
01:05:18,708 --> 01:05:20,666
I'D LIKE TO BORROW SOME BOOKS
FROM THEIR LIBRARY

70
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,875
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND GOING THERE
AND PICKING THEM UP FOR ME.

71
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:27,458
- BOOKS, HUH? SEEMS LIKE A
FAIRLY REASONABLE REQUEST.

72
01:05:27,541 --> 01:05:29,583
- REALLY? EVEN IF I HAPPEN
TO HAVE A LIST

73
01:05:29,666 --> 01:05:31,583
OF SAY 30 TITLES, OR SO?

74
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:33,791
- THIRTY? ARE YOU KIDDING?

75
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:42,583
- HUH...

76
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:46,083
YOU KNOW, UH, FLIES IN HERE,

77
01:05:46,166 --> 01:05:48,416
THEY MIGHT BE KIND OF
HARD TO COME BY.

78
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,791
THIS CELL KEEPS OUT
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING.

79
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:52,166
SO...

80
01:05:55,166 --> 01:05:59,291
OKAY. MAN THIS IS TOUGH.
OH, COME ON!

81
01:05:59,375 --> 01:06:01,375
( grunting )

82
01:06:08,208 --> 01:06:10,291
HUH. GUESS WE'RE SHARING.

83
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:12,750
- Guard: I'VE BROUGHT THEM.

84
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:15,708
- AH, THERE'S A SIGHT
FOR SORE EYES.

85
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:20,541
- LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
YOU'VE GOT TO PASS THE TIME,

86
01:06:20,625 --> 01:06:22,500
BUT THIS IS STARTING
TO GET OUT OF HAND.

87
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:24,375
- ABOUT THAT...I HATE TO ASK,

88
01:06:24,458 --> 01:06:26,916
BUT WOULD YOU CURSE MY NAME
IF I ADDED ANOTHER TEN BOOKS

89
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
TO MY LIST?

90
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:29,791
- HUH? HOW DO YOU STILL
NOT HAVE ENOUGH?

91
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,791
SOMEBODY'S UP
WAY PAST THEIR BEDTIME.

92
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,708
- HMM? UH, YEAH.

93
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:48,708
- DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY, KID,

94
01:06:48,791 --> 01:06:50,666
BUT MOST FOLKS WOULD JUST
CURL UP AND STARE BLANKLY

95
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,000
AT THE CEILING ALL DAY

96
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:54,416
AFTER A FEW MONTHS
STUCK IN A SITUATION LIKE YOURS.

97
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:58,291
HELL, I'VE SEEN GUYS TWICE AS
ENERGETIC GO QUIET AFTER A WEEK.

98
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:01,416
BEING LOCKED IN A DARK CELL
DOES SOMETHING TO A MAN.

99
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:08,541
POINT IS...KEEP IT UP
YOU'RE GOING TO HURT YOUR EYES.

100
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:20,958
HERE'S TODAY'S LOT.
- PERFECT. THANK YOU.

101
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:23,166
- I'LL HAVE TO PLUNDER THE ROYAL
COLLECTION BEFORE LONG

102
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:25,125
AT THE RATE
YOU'VE BEEN READING.

103
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,708
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER
I'D THINK YOU WERE

104
01:07:26,791 --> 01:07:29,333
TRYING TO TURN THIS CELL
INTO A HALL OF RECORDS.

105
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:32,583
- YOUR LITTLE GIRL EVER GET
OVER HER CASE OF SNIFFLES?

106
01:07:32,666 --> 01:07:34,916
- OH, YEAH, GOOD AS NEW,
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

107
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,541
AND JUST WAIT'LL YOU HEAR THIS.

108
01:07:36,625 --> 01:07:39,041
THE STINKER TOOK HER
VERY FIRST STEPS THIS MORNING!

109
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:41,333
- OH, SO THAT'S IT.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BEAMING.

110
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:44,333
- YOU CANNOT IMAGINE THE JOY
OF SEEING YOUR LITTLE PRINCESS

111
01:07:44,416 --> 01:07:46,000
CROSS THE THRESHOLD
INTO WOMANHOOD.

112
01:07:46,083 --> 01:07:48,375
THEY GROW UP SO FAST.
( sobbing )

113
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:50,541
- YEAH. I DON'T THINK
HER CHILDHOOD'S

114
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:52,125
PASSED YOU BY JUST YET.

115
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:53,375
BUT YOU KNOW,

116
01:07:53,458 --> 01:07:54,750
IF THIS IS HOW YOU ARE
WHEN SHE LEARNS TO WALK,

117
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:56,375
IMAGINE THE WRECK YOU'LL BE
WHEN SHE GETS MARRIED.

118
01:07:56,458 --> 01:07:58,500
- ( grunting )
I'M NOT LETTING HER MARRY!

119
01:07:58,583 --> 01:08:01,250
YOU'RE TRYING TO STEAL HER
AWAY FROM ME, AREN'T YOU?

120
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:02,708
OVER MY DEAD BODY!

121
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:05,750
- GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF.
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

122
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:10,375
NOBODY'S STEALING ANYONE.

123
01:08:10,458 --> 01:08:12,625
BUT THAT TEMPER'S GOING TO
COST YOU YOUR HEALTH SOMEDAY

124
01:08:12,708 --> 01:08:14,083
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL.

125
01:08:14,166 --> 01:08:15,541
AND YOU DON'T WANT
YOUR BABY GIRL GROWING UP

126
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:17,583
ON A BATTLEFIELD, AM I RIGHT?

127
01:08:17,666 --> 01:08:19,416
- WHAT KIND OF QUESTION
IS THAT TO ASK SOMEONE

128
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,875
WITH A KID?

129
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:23,583
OF COURSE I DON'T WANT HER
TO GROW UP ON A BATTLEFIELD.

130
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:25,291
- NO ONE DOES.

131
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:27,500
BUT IT HAPPENS MORE OFTEN
THAN YOU'D THINK.

132
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:31,416
- ( shivering )

133
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,708
( grunting )

134
01:08:37,833 --> 01:08:41,583
WOW. SOMETHING
REALLY SMELLS GOOD.

135
01:08:41,666 --> 01:08:43,333
- OH, YEAH. GOOD NOSE.

136
01:08:43,416 --> 01:08:45,291
TODAY'S A CHEESE AND GARLIC
KIND OF DAY.

137
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:47,541
THOUGHT I'D PAMPER MYSELF.

138
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:50,041
- THAT'S A VERY CRUEL THING
TO WAVE IN FRONT OF SOMEONE

139
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:51,541
WHO LIVES ON SOUP.

140
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:54,125
- IF MY WIFE'S BUSINESS AFFORDS
ME THE OCCASIONAL LUXURY,

141
01:08:54,208 --> 01:08:55,166
THAT'S MY CONCERN.

142
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:57,458
YOU'VE GOT MEAT!

143
01:08:57,541 --> 01:09:00,000
- SO, UH, THE TWO OF YOU
WORK TOGETHER?

144
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:01,500
- YEAH, I HELP HER
SELL VEGETABLES

145
01:09:01,583 --> 01:09:03,041
AT THE MORNING MARKET MOST DAYS

146
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:04,166
BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY CARE
TO HAVE HER

147
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,500
WORK IN THE STALL ALONE

148
01:09:05,583 --> 01:09:07,666
WHEN SHE'S GOT
OUR DAUGHTER IN TOW.

149
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:09,875
HUH, SOUNDS LIKE
A HARD LIFE, I KNOW.

150
01:09:09,958 --> 01:09:12,208
I'D CHOOSE IT OVER
BEING A SOLIDER ANY DAY.

151
01:09:12,291 --> 01:09:15,166
I'VE HAD MORE THAN MY FILL
OF MILITARY LIFE.

152
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:18,833
I WATCHED SOME OF MY BEST
FRIENDS DIE IN THE LAST WAR.

153
01:09:18,916 --> 01:09:21,333
NO TELLING HOW I CAME
THROUGH IT ALL INTACT.

154
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:25,250
- I'M SORRY.
- THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

155
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:28,250
I TURNED DOWN A CAREER OFFICER'S
PAY TO TAKE THIS JOB.

156
01:09:28,333 --> 01:09:31,166
IT'S FAR FROM GLAMOROUS,
BUT I HAVE NO REGRETS.

157
01:09:31,791 --> 01:09:33,333
- I'LL BET.

158
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:36,875
- ( birds chirping )

159
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:39,875
- ( both chuckling )

160
01:09:39,958 --> 01:09:41,458
- WHO'S MY GIRL?

161
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:03,166
- (Ryner snoring )

162
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:04,666
- Sion: INTERESTING.

163
01:10:08,416 --> 01:10:11,041
THIS IS THE LIFE
YOU'VE CHOSEN, IS IT?

164
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:14,375
GET ALL THE REST YOU CAN,
MY LETHARGIC FRIEND.

165
01:10:14,458 --> 01:10:16,416
CHANGE IS IN THE WIND.

166
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:28,166
- ( yawning )

167
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:36,500
( sighs )

168
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:41,500
- DON'T THINK I'LL EVER
FIGURE YOU OUT, LITTLE BUDDY.

169
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:42,958
THERE'S A WHOLE WIDE
WORLD OUT THERE

170
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:44,500
TO MAKE A PARADISE OUT OF,

171
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:46,958
AND YOU KEEP SPINNING AWAY
IN THIS LITTLE DUMP.

172
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:49,500
IT'S JUST NOT HEALTHY.
YOU'RE FIXATED.

173
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:52,666
( scoffs )

174
01:10:55,791 --> 01:10:59,333
( Ryner yelling )

175
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:08,666
( panting ) OKAY, MY LIFE
JUST FLASHED BEFORE MY EYES.

176
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:11,750
IF I DON'T CLEAN THIS PLACE UP
I'LL BE BURIED ALIVE.

177
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:13,916
WELL, MAYBE I'LL TAKE
A NAP FIRST.

178
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,375
I'LL GET STARTED
AFTER BREAKFAST.

179
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:21,166
WELL, SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

180
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:23,000
SO WHAT'S ON THE MENU TODAY?

181
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,041
HEY, WHAT'S WITH
THE GRIM MOUTH?

182
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:30,083
THAT'S NOT YOUR
USUAL EXPRESSION.

183
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,083
WHAT, DID YOU AND THE WIFE
HAVE ANOTHER ONE

184
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:36,125
OF YOUR FAMOUS SPATS...

185
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:39,291
OR DID DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL
BRING HOME HER FIRST BOYFRIEND?

186
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,500
- OH, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD

187
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:42,416
SHE'S BARELY EVEN
THREE YEARS OLD!

188
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,208
- HEY, TIMES AREN'T WHAT
THEY USED TO BE, BUDDY.

189
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:46,291
THREE YEARS OLD IS THE NEW 14.

190
01:11:46,375 --> 01:11:48,208
- LOOK, WHATEVER SICK WORLD
YOU CALL HOME,

191
01:11:48,291 --> 01:11:50,000
MY DAUGHTER IS
NOT A PART OF IT.

192
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:51,708
- EVERY PARENT TELLS
THEMSELVES THAT.

193
01:11:51,791 --> 01:11:54,083
- ENOUGH!

194
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:58,750
ANYWAY, THAT'S NOT
WHY I LOOK GRIM.

195
01:11:58,833 --> 01:12:02,208
- SO WHAT IS EATING YOU, THEN?
AND SPEAKING OF WHICH,

196
01:12:02,291 --> 01:12:03,541
WHERE'S BREAKFAST?

197
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:05,958
- ( keys jingling )

198
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:12,250
- IT'S OKAY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY IT.

199
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:16,750
MY EXECUTION WAS PRETTY MUCH
AN INEVITABILITY.

200
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,458
THE POWERS THAT BE WERE BOUND
TO FIGURE KEEPING ME LOCKED UP

201
01:12:19,541 --> 01:12:20,875
WAS TOO RISKY.

202
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:25,625
I CAN'T SAY I BLAME THEM.
TWO YEARS WAS GENEROUS.

203
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:30,625
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

204
01:12:30,708 --> 01:12:32,875
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU COULD
HELP ME CARRY THE RESEARCH PAPER

205
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:34,458
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON?

206
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:37,916
- I HAVE STRICT ORDERS TO SEE
TO IT THAT YOU LEAVE THE CELL

207
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,291
EMPTY-HANDED.

208
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:42,750
- OH. RIGHT. WELL, I SUPPOSE
WHERE I'M HEADED I DON'T

209
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:44,791
EXACTLY NEED ANY OF THIS STUFF.

210
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:47,333
- ( sighs )

211
01:12:47,416 --> 01:12:50,250
- COME ON, WE BOTH KNEW
THAT THIS DAY HAD TO COME.

212
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:52,708
LET'S GET IT OVER WITH.

213
01:12:52,791 --> 01:12:55,625
- ( sobbing )

214
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,250
- GOODBYE, THEN.
BEST OF LUCK.

215
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,625
- ( girl humming )

216
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:16,000
- HEY! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- BYE!

217
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:19,708
- BYE-BYE, BAD GUY!

218
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:22,041
- ( chuckling )

219
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:42,000
- Ferris: RYNER LUTE?

220
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:54,000
- WELL, IT'S BEEN REAL NICE.
TAKE CARE, BUDDY.

221
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:04,750
AM I ALLOWED TO
ASK A QUESTION?

222
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:06,541
- WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW, PERVERT?

223
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:11,500
- HUH?

224
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:14,791
UH, OKAY, THAT MAKES
TWO QUESTIONS...

225
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:16,833
THE FIRST BEING WHERE THE IDEA
OF CALLING YOURS TRULY

226
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:17,916
A PERVERT COMES FROM?

227
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
- YOUR COUNTENANCE.

228
01:14:20,083 --> 01:14:23,250
THAT AND THE PERSONAL HISTORY
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO UNEARTH.

229
01:14:24,541 --> 01:14:25,583
SORRY TO HAVE ASKED.

230
01:14:25,666 --> 01:14:26,916
THE SECOND QUESTION IS

231
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,958
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF I MADE A BREAK FOR IT?

232
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:31,708
- I TAKE IT
THAT'S NOT RHETORICAL.

233
01:14:31,791 --> 01:14:34,541
- SORRY, NO.
I HAVE A PROMISE TO KEEP.

234
01:14:35,666 --> 01:14:38,750
WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER!
IZUCHI!

235
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:44,208
- ( both grunting )

236
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:51,000
- WOW. THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

237
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:55,250
BETTER FOCUS.

238
01:14:55,333 --> 01:14:56,791
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE
THIS ONE A BIT MORE SERIOUSLY

239
01:14:56,875 --> 01:14:58,125
THAN I THOUGHT.

240
01:14:58,208 --> 01:15:00,375
- OH, SO ALL THAT JUST NOW
WAS A PRACTICE RUN?

241
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:03,875
- YEAH, JUST FEELING OUT
MY OPPONENT.

242
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:06,416
- AH, YES. I CAN SEE
WHY HE WANTS YOU.

243
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,541
- HUH?

244
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:10,583
- EN GARDE!
- WAIT, HOLD ON!

245
01:15:10,666 --> 01:15:13,083
I OFFER UP THIS CONTRACT
TO BEAR THE WICKED BEAST

246
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:14,958
THAT SLEEPS WITHIN THE EARTH!

247
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:35,083
WHATEVER MAGIC YOU'RE USING
TO KEEP UP WITH MINE,

248
01:15:35,166 --> 01:15:36,875
IT'S VERY UN-SPORTSMAN LIKE!

249
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:41,833
- ( grunting continues )

250
01:15:41,916 --> 01:15:44,708
- OKAY, NEVER MIND.
SHE'S NOT USING MAGIC!

251
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:49,083
WAIT!

252
01:15:49,166 --> 01:15:52,500
WHAT I SEEK IS THE WATER CLOUD.
MIZUCHI!

253
01:16:07,458 --> 01:16:10,041
- TELL ME.
WHY DID YOU HOLD BACK?

254
01:16:10,125 --> 01:16:11,833
- WHO SAYS I WAS
HOLDING BACK, HUH?

255
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:13,416
- DON'T PLAY DUMB.

256
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,958
ANY MAGICIAN WORTHY OF THE NAME
WOULD HAVE DEPLOYED FIRE MAGIC

257
01:16:16,041 --> 01:16:17,541
IN THAT SCENARIO.

258
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:20,000
I'D HAVE HAD NO COUNTERATTACK
FOR IT AND YOU WOULD HAVE WON.

259
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:22,166
- YEAH, AND THERE'D HAVE ALSO
BEEN AN EXCELLENT CHANCE OF YOU

260
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:23,625
BEING SCORCHED TO CINDERS.

261
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:25,083
YOU CAN FORGIVE ME
IF I CAN'T BRING MYSELF

262
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:26,625
TO MAR A PRETTY FACE.

263
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,375
- AH! THAT'S IT, IS IT?

264
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:32,291
- YOUR TWISTED,
SEX-OBSESSED LITTLE MIND

265
01:16:32,375 --> 01:16:34,083
COULDN'T BEAR THE THOUGHT
OF RAVAGING ME

266
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:37,125
WITHOUT ENSURING THAT I WAS IN
ABSOLUTELY PRISTINE CONDITION,

267
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:41,166
AND SO YOU SURRENDERED
THE VICTORY. VERY NOBLE OF YOU.

268
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:44,000
- UH, YOU'RE READING
WAY TOO MUCH INTO THINGS.

269
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:46,875
- QUIT DAWDLING. WE HAVE
AN AUDIENCE WITH THE KING.

270
01:16:46,958 --> 01:16:49,833
- YEAH, SURE. I'LL JUST STROLL
WILLINGLY TO MY OWN EXECUTION.

271
01:16:49,916 --> 01:16:50,625
THAT SOUNDS FUN.

272
01:16:50,708 --> 01:16:52,291
- STAY BEHIND IF YOU LIKE.

273
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:56,375
YOUR REGRETS MAKE NO
DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER TO ME.

274
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:58,083
- RIGHT.

275
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:03,291
DAMN IT!

276
01:17:03,375 --> 01:17:04,583
- ( echoing )

277
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:10,166
- ( Ryner exclaims )

278
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:15,666
WHAT IN THE WORLD'S
COME OVER THIS PLACE?

279
01:17:21,041 --> 01:17:25,000
- TO BID YOU A FAIR WELCOME
IN THE COURTLY MANNER, HI.

280
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,083
- OKAY. THAT'S IT. WAKE ME
WHEN THIS MAKES SENSE.

281
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:33,416
GOODNIGHT.

282
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,208
- I REMIND YOU, YOU'RE IN
THE PRESENCE OF ROYALTY.

283
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:38,333
- GOOD A PLACE TO SLEEP AS ANY!

284
01:17:38,416 --> 01:17:40,708
- SO, THEN...
I TRUST HE BEHAVED WELL?

285
01:17:40,791 --> 01:17:42,916
- I'M AFRAID
HE'S QUITE DEPRAVED, SIR.

286
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,416
I WOULD NOT SET HIM FREE,

287
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,708
BUT THEN I AM NOT OF A MIND
TO BEAR HIS FUTURE CRIMES

288
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:47,625
ON MY CONSCIENCE.

289
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:49,708
- BUT...

290
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,833
- IT MUST BE SAID THAT HE DID
TREAT ME RESPECTFULLY

291
01:17:51,916 --> 01:17:53,333
IN THE COURSE OF OUR BOUT.

292
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:54,750
- EXCELLENT.

293
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:59,500
ON YOUR FEET, RYNER.
I HAVE NEWS ABOUT KIEFER.

294
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:03,333
- HOW EXCITING FOR YOU.
- Sion: SHE'S NO LONGER WITH US.

295
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:04,875
- ( gasping )

296
01:18:06,291 --> 01:18:09,541
- BUT NOT DEAD.
- SNEAKY RAT.

297
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:10,916
- SHE TOOK HER
LEAVE OF ROLAND

298
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,958
AND BECAME A
CITIZEN OF THE WORLD.

299
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:15,791
ASKING THAT I KEEP AN
EYE ON YOU IN HER ABSENCE.

300
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:20,375
BUT I DIDN'T ARRANGE YOUR
RELEASE TO KEEP YOU ABREAST

301
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:23,041
OF KIEFER'S EXPLOITS.

302
01:18:23,125 --> 01:18:24,750
- ( gasping ) THAT'S MY THESIS!

303
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:27,375
- "HOW TO BUILD A KINGDOM
OF AFTERNOON NAPS"

304
01:18:27,458 --> 01:18:30,375
A RATHER AMATEURISH TITLE
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY SAYING SO,

305
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:33,208
BUT THE IDEA APPROACHES GENIUS.

306
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:35,333
"WHAT BETTER GUARANTEE
OF WORLD PEACE

307
01:18:35,416 --> 01:18:38,500
"THAN THE SHADOW OF MUTUALLY
ASSURED ANNIHILATION?

308
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:41,250
"AND WHAT BETTER MEANS
OF CASTING THAT SHADOW."

309
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:42,583
- YOU KNOW,

310
01:18:42,666 --> 01:18:43,833
IF I HAD INTENDED FOR YOU
TO READ THAT THING...

311
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:46,333
- ALAS, READ IT I HAVE,
OLD FRIEND.

312
01:18:48,208 --> 01:18:50,291
- I'M INSPIRED.

313
01:18:50,375 --> 01:18:53,416
TO YOU I ASSIGN THE SACRED TASK
OF UNCOVERING WHAT YOUR THESIS

314
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,541
REFERS TO AS HERO RELICS.

315
01:18:55,625 --> 01:18:57,291
- YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND!

316
01:18:57,375 --> 01:19:00,333
- I WON'T TEMPT FATE
BY SENDING YOU ALONE, THOUGH.

317
01:19:00,416 --> 01:19:02,416
TO ENSURE
THE MISSION'S INTEGRITY,

318
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:05,291
FERRIS WILL JOIN YOU.

319
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:08,750
- I REQUEST THIS OF YOU
FOR THE SAKE OF PEACE.

320
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:11,208
- I JUST WROTE THAT STUPID THING
TO OCCUPY MYSELF!

321
01:19:11,291 --> 01:19:12,333
IT'S MEANINGLESS!

322
01:19:12,416 --> 01:19:15,416
- I SUPPOSE YOU'D PREFER...
EXECUTION?

323
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,041
- ARE YOU ACTUALLY
THREATENING ME?

324
01:19:17,125 --> 01:19:19,000
- WITH ALL DUE REVERENCE,
YOUR MAJESTY,

325
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:21,166
I ANSWER ONLY TO
THE HEAD OF HOUSE ERIS,

326
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:22,458
NOT ROLAND'S KING.

327
01:19:22,541 --> 01:19:24,541
MY BROTHER WILL NOT BE PLEASED.

328
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:27,166
- YOUR BROTHER GAVE ME
LEAVE TO SEND YOU.

329
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:29,583
"REFUSE AND THE
WYNNIT DANGO SHOP

330
01:19:29,666 --> 01:19:31,250
WILL BE REDUCED
TO ASH AND RUBBLE

331
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:34,291
IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE."
HIS WORDS, MY DEAR.

332
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,958
- Lucile: YOU HAVE
TWO MINUTES TO SET OUT.

333
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:41,500
- WHAT THE HELL?
WHERE'S THAT COMING FROM?

334
01:19:41,583 --> 01:19:44,375
- HE'S DEADLY SERIOUS.

335
01:19:44,458 --> 01:19:47,166
WE'RE WASTING TIME.
MOVE IT.

336
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:48,750
YOU'VE THREE CHOICES HERE.

337
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:51,750
ONE, LOOSE YOUR HEAD.
TWO, LOOSE YOUR TORSO.

338
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:55,000
THREE, DO AS I TELL YOU.
WHICH DO YOU PREFER?

339
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:57,708
- ( grunting ) I SWEAR YOU WILL
LIVE TO REGRET THIS, SION!

340
01:19:57,791 --> 01:19:59,041
- THE SOONER YOU DEPART, RYNER,

341
01:19:59,125 --> 01:20:00,583
THE SOONER YOU CAN FULFILL
THAT OATH.

342
01:20:00,666 --> 01:20:02,541
- DAMN YOU!
- Lucile: ONE MINUTE.

343
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:07,083
- SOMEONE TELL ME
WHOSE VOICE THAT IS!

344
01:20:07,166 --> 01:20:10,875
- GOOD AFTERNOON, YOUR MAJESTY.
- TAKE CARE OF YOUR CHARGE.

345
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:14,791
- LET GO OF ME!
- QUIT STRUGGLING, PERVERT.

346
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:16,500
- STOP CALLING ME THAT!

347
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:21,125
- ( door closing )

348
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:25,583
- TELL ME, IS THIS THE ROAD
DOWN WHICH I MUST TRAVEL?

349
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:27,000
- Lucile: NOT NECESSARILY.

350
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:30,125
SEVERAL PATHS
YET LAY OPEN TO YOU.

351
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,583
- I DON'T SUSPECT A SCEPTER
WILL BE THE LAST WEAPON

352
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:33,833
YOU BRANDISH.

353
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:36,416
THAT SAID, AN OLD KING
WEARIES OF HIS DIGNITY

354
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,083
SWIFTER THAN A NEW.

355
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:42,375
HENCE YOU STILL DRAW BREATH.

356
01:20:43,916 --> 01:20:46,875
- Sion: MANY PATHS
YET LAY BEFORE ME.

357
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:49,875
HOW MANY LAY BEFORE
THE RELUCTANT SEEKER?

358
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:54,333
GOOD LUCK, RYNER AND THANK YOU.

359
01:20:56,541 --> 01:20:59,541
- Ryner: IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
WE WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN VERY FAR

360
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:02,041
IF DEEP DOWN, PEOPLE WEREN'T
JUST AS LOATH TO KILL

361
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:03,875
AS THEY ARE TO DIE.

362
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:07,375
WAR FORCES THEM
TO CHOOSE ONE OVER THE OTHER.

363
01:21:07,458 --> 01:21:10,458
HIGHBORN OR LOW,
NO ONE WANTS TO SOW MISERY.

364
01:21:10,541 --> 01:21:11,666
NOT REALLY.

365
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:14,208
THEY JUST DON'T SEE AN OPTION.

366
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:15,958
WHEN OUR BACK'S
AGAINST THE WALL,

367
01:21:16,041 --> 01:21:18,791
THE BEST OF US SEE THINGS
IN BLACK AND WHITE.

368
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:22,000
I'VE NEVER PUT MUCH STOCK
IN CHANGING THE WORLD.

369
01:21:22,083 --> 01:21:24,416
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT,

370
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:28,083
THINGS CAN'T CONTINUE
THE WAY THEY ARE.

371
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:31,708
IF KILL OR DIE
IS THE ONLY CHOICE,

372
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:35,208
ITS TIME TO EXPAND OUR OPTIONS.

373
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:38,875
SO FAR, I'VE SPARED MYSELF
THE PAIN OF TAKING A GOOD,

374
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:41,208
HARD LOOK AT MY PAST.

375
01:21:41,291 --> 01:21:43,375
BUT IF PAIN AND BITTER TRUTH
ARE WHAT'S NEEDED

376
01:21:43,458 --> 01:21:46,291
TO RESHAPE
MANKIND'S DESTINY,

377
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:48,541
THEN SO BE IT.

378
01:21:48,625 --> 01:21:51,166
A WORLD THAT HURTS KIEFER,

379
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:54,416
THAT KILLS TAHILE AND TONY
AND FAHLE.

380
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:58,333
A WORLD WHERE SION
CAN DO NOTHING BUT BROOD,

381
01:21:58,416 --> 01:21:59,791
IS BEST SWAPPED FOR A WORLD

382
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:01,750
WHERE PEOPLE CAN
JUST CLOSE THEIR EYES

383
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:06,166
ON A LATE AFTERNOON...AND NAP.

384
01:22:12,083 --> 01:22:13,833
- ( theme song playing )

385
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:43,625
- Ryner: YOU KNOW,
I ENJOY A TREK

386
01:23:43,708 --> 01:23:44,750
THROUGH PARTS UNKNOWN

387
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:46,416
OR HIGH ADVENTURE AS MUCH
AS ANYBODY,

388
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,833
BUT HAVING A FRIGID,
SWORD-WIELDING, PSYCHO-VIXEN

389
01:23:48,916 --> 01:23:50,333
WITH A CHIP ON HER SHOULDER

390
01:23:50,416 --> 01:23:52,375
DRAG ME AROUND BY THE SCRUFF
IS NOT EXACTLY MY IDEA OF...

391
01:23:52,458 --> 01:23:53,833
OH, WAIT. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

392
01:23:53,916 --> 01:23:55,250
I WAS JUST KIDDING! DON'T...
( yelling )
