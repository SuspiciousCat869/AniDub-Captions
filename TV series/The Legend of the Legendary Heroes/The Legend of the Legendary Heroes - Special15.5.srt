1
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:23,625
- Iris: THE ONLY THING MORE
TERRIBLE THAN A WICKED BEAST,

2
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,458
IS ONE WHO'S MADE OFF
WITH YOUR BIG SISTER

3
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,166
LIKE A THIEF IN THE NIGHT.

4
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,208
OH, HOW AWFUL IT MUST BE
HAVING TO EAT STRANGE DANGO

5
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,583
IN FOREIGN LANDS.

6
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,125
NOT KNOWING THE FLAVOR
UNTIL YOU BITE INTO IT.

7
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:37,583
BLEH! STILL, MAYBE SHE STUMBLED
ON SOME AMAZING NEW TASTE

8
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,541
THAT WILL CHANGE THE WAY
SHE LOOKS AT THE WORLD.

9
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,625
THIS IS SO THE LAST THING
I WANT TO DO

10
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:46,250
BUT HIS MAJESTY DID ENTRUST ME
WITH A SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY.

11
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,583
( chuckles )

12
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,333
ALL DONE.

13
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,833
( chuckles )
RISE AND SHINE, SIR.

14
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,000
- WHY ARE YOU SITTING
AT MY DESK, IRIS?

15
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,416
BECAUSE I WROTE A REPORT.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,125
I CALL IT "THE PRINCESS
AND THE WICKED BEAST."

17
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,083
- ( theme song playing )

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,958
- Iris: THE WICKED BEAST
TOOK ONE LOOK AT THE THRONE

19
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,791
AND WENT SLACK-JAWED.

20
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,250
- Sion: TO BE EXPECTED.

21
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:45,791
TO BID YOU A FAIR WELCOME
IN THE COURTLY MANOR, HI.

22
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,666
- THE FOUL CREATURE HAD NO IDEA
WHO'D BECOME KING

23
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,375
WHILE HE WAS BUSY NAPPING
HIS LIFE AWAY IN A PRISON CELL.

24
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,000
- I DON'T SUPPOSE SO.

25
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,375
- IF YOU ASK ME,

26
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,958
EVERYONE IN THIS STORY WOULD
HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF,

27
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,250
IF YOU'D JUST KEPT HIM LOCKED
AWAY FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

28
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,916
- WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
SOMETHING TOLD ME IT WAS PRUDENT

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,708
TO GIVE HIM A SECOND CHANCE.

30
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,916
- YEAH, BUT WHAT IF HE'D
ALREADY BLOWN THE SECOND CHANCE

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,416
SOMEONE ELSE GAVE HIM

32
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,416
AND THAT'S WHY HE WAS TOSSED
IN THE CLINK TO START WITH?

33
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,625
- RYNER'S SITUATION
WAS RATHER UNIQUE.

34
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,250
- ( grunts ) YOUR MAJESTY'S GOT
A SOFT SPOT FOR PERVIES

35
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,250
THAT KNOW HOW TO MASH
A FEW PRETTY WORDS TOGETHER.

36
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,916
THAT'S WHY YOU FORGAVE HIM.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,166
- ( chuckles ) NOT EXACTLY.

38
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,250
BUT WHEN THE WORDS,
THEY "MASH" TOGETHER

39
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,125
CAN POTENTIALLY
CHANGE THE WORLD,

40
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,833
THAT'S ANOTHER
MATTER ALTOGETHER.

41
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,916
- RYNER? CHANGE THE WORLD?
( chuckles )

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,458
- WHAT HE WROTE MAY HAVE
THE POWER TO STEER US ALL CLEAR

43
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,875
OF A VERY BAD END.

44
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,500
ITS CENTRAL IDEA SEEMED TO ME

45
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,000
TO POSSESS WHAT SOME
PEOPLE CALL VISION.

46
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:41,083
- VISION? WAIT A SEC. WE LOOK AT
WORDS, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

47
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,000
ER, ADULTS MAKE
NO SENSE SOMETIMES.

48
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,750
- OW.

49
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:52,041
- GOOD AFTERNOON, YOUR MAJESTY.
- TAKE CARE OF YOUR CHARGE.

50
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,916
- LET GO OF ME!

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,291
- QUIT STRUGGLING, PERVERT.
- STOP CALLING ME THAT!

52
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,458
- AND SO THE WICKED BEAST
WAS SENT ON A MISSION,

53
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,791
WITH THE BEAUTIFUL,
VIRTUOUS PRINCESS IN TOW.

54
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:10,208
BY A ROYAL DECREE, THEY WERE
ORDERED TO UNCOVER HERO RELICS

55
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,458
AND BRING THEM HOME
TO THE KING.

56
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,250
- I DIDN'T ORDER THEM.
I ASKED THEM AS A FRIEND.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,208
- THE FIRST RELIC
THEY UNCOVERED,

58
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,083
MYSTERIOUSLY GREW
A HUNDRED TIMES

59
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,666
IT'S ORIGINAL SIZE IN A FLASH.

60
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,166
- Ryner: IT'S POINTLESS,
I DON'T SEE A THING!

61
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,916
- Iris: THE SECOND ONE,
HE GOT IMPATIENT WITH

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,041
AND THREW TO THE GROUND,

63
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,833
UNLEASHING A NASTY SURPRISE.

64
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,208
- THINGS DON'T ALWAYS WORK OUT
QUITE AS YOU EXPECT THEM TO.

65
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,916
- WAIT, HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN WEARING THAT?

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,083
- OH. I PICKED IT UP
IN THE RUINS.

67
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,708
- Iris: HE STOLE A LOVELY
PIECE OF JEWELRY

68
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,625
THE PRINCESS HAD EVERY
RIGHT TO WEAR,

69
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,750
AND BEING THE EPITOME OF EVIL,
HE TURNED IT INTO A WEAPON

70
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,291
THAT MADE THE GROUND UNDER
THEIR FEET TREMBLE FOR MILES.

71
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,625
NO, NOT EVEN MOUNTAINS
ARE SAFE FROM WICKED BEASTS.

72
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,333
LAND SURVEYORS AND MAPMAKERS
WHO'D SPENT THEIR WHOLE LIVES

73
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,875
CHARTING THE REGION,

74
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,541
SHUFFLED LISTLESSLY BACK TO
THEIR DRAWING BOARDS IN DEFEAT.

75
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,125
- Sion: PERHAPS, THE
CARTOGRAPHY GUILD

76
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,083
SAW IT AS A BLESSING
IN DISGUISE.

77
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:26,208
I DOUBT, OF COURSE, THE MOUNTAIN
SHARED THEIR ENTHUSIASM.

78
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:33,333
- Ryner: ( gasps )
SOMEONE'S STILL KICKING.

79
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,875
NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU GO ON AHEAD, FERRIS.

80
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,541
I'LL CATCH UP TO YOU AS SOON
AS I'M DONE HERE.

81
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,833
- ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND
THAT HIS EVIL KNOWS NO BOUNDS.

82
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,583
IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO SAY
ALOUD AT LEAST TWO TIMES.

83
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,916
YOUR MAJESTY, FOR YOUR OWN GOOD,
REPEAT AFTER ME.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,166
BEING FRIENDLY WITH
THE WICKED BEAST

85
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,500
WILL PUT A BABY IN
YOUR TUMMY! GO!

86
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,458
- BEING FRIENDLY
WITH THE WICKED BEAST

87
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,125
WILL PUT A BABY IN YOUR TUMMY.

88
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,500
- ( snoring )

89
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,541
- IN HIS HALF-HEARTED SEARCH
FOR HERO RELICS,

90
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,541
THE WICKED BEAST RUMMAGED
THROUGH THE LIBRARIES

91
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,041
OF NEIGHBORING KINGDOMS.

92
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,625
- STUPID LITTLE...

93
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,333
- ( groans )

94
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,041
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

95
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,333
- Iris: OF COURSE, PRESENTED
WITH AN OPPORTUNITY

96
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,000
FOR WICKEDNESS, THE BEAST
MADE NO BONES ABOUT

97
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,208
TRYING TO STEAL AN INNOCENT
LITTLE GIRL'S FAVORITE BOOK.

98
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,625
FORTUNATELY, THE
PRINCESS WAS THERE

99
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,291
TO MAKE SURE JUSTICE PREVAILED,

100
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,875
AND GAVE THE BEAST
A STERN LESSON.

101
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,041
- ( grunts )

102
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,583
- Sion: HMM. PERHAPS,
YOU MEAN LESION.

103
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,875
- ALWAYS BEWARE OF
THE CHARMING BEAST,

104
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:41,208
HE HAS MANY TRICKS WITH WHICH
TO LURE THE UNSUSPECTING.

105
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,083
- ( groans) I'M GOING
TO KILL YOU.

106
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,333
( yawns )

107
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,875
- HELLO, OLD FRIEND.
I HAVE MISSED YOU TERRIBLY.

108
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,500
- Iris: THEIR TRAVEL FUNDS
WERE WAY TOO MUCH

109
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,833
FOR SUCH A SIMPLE MISSION.

110
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:56,875
SO TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE,

111
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,958
HIS MAJESTY PUT THEM
ON A SECOND JOB.

112
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,000
- Sion: WELL, WE COULDN'T
JUST LET THEM VACATION

113
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,333
AT THE CROWN'S EXPENSE,

114
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,583
NOW COULD WE?

115
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,375
- Iris: RUMOR HAD IT
THAT SHADOWY ASSASSINS

116
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,375
WOULD SEE HIS MAJESTY'S
JOURNEY TO NELPHA

117
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,250
AS A CHANCE TO STRIKE HIM DOWN.

118
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,333
THE WICKED BEAST DID A
LOT MORE COMPLAINING

119
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,750
THAN GUARDING, THOUGH.

120
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,458
- Ryner: I'M EXHAUSTED.
AND FOR THE RECORD, THIS SUCKS.

121
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,416
REMIND ME WHY WE LET SION
TALK US INTO THIS FARCE?

122
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,125
- Iris: TO WHICH
THE PRINCESS REPLIED...

123
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:33,208
- WELL, IT'S EITHER BE HIS
TEMPORARY BODY GUARDS,

124
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,083
OR THE WYNNIT DANGO SHOP
WILL BE DECIMATED.

125
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,375
- SO, UH, I TAKE THAT TO MEAN
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED FOR HIM.

126
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,916
- Iris: SENSITIVE TO
THE BUSINESS STRATEGIES

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,250
OF REGIONALLY AFFILIATED
MARKET SHARE COMPETITORS,

128
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,000
THE PRINCESS SAW HER
OWN KINGDOM'S CHANCE

129
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:46,333
TO SITUATE ITSELF WITH A BROADER
ECONOMIC CONTEXT.

130
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,458
- WELL, I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY
CALL THE DANGO INDUSTRY BROAD,

131
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,291
BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY
UNDER THREAT.

132
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,750
- TO GUARANTEE THAT THE BEAST
STAYED ON HIS BEST BEHAVIOR,

133
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,250
WHILE WANDERING ABROAD
WITH SUCH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,

134
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,375
HIS MAJESTY APPOINTED AN ELITE
FORCE TO KEEP TABS ON HIM.

135
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,500
- AND WHEN THOUGHTS OF SLAYING
YOUR FORMER BRETHREN AIL YOU,

136
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,875
MAY THOUGHTS OF JUSTICE
SPUR YOU ON.

137
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,041
KNOW THIS, THE ETERNAL
THANKS OF YOUR KING

138
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,208
GOES WITH YOU ON YOUR QUEST.

139
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,291
- AND WE, YOUR SQUIRES,
ARE GRATEFUL FOR IT.

140
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:18,666
MY LORD, I GLADLY ACCEPT,
WHATEVER MAY BEFALL US.

141
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,333
I GAVE UP ONCE. I TURNED
MY BACK ON THE IDEA OF HOPE.

142
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,041
I SOUGHT TO CLOSE MY EYES
TO THE TROUBLES OF THE WORLD

143
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,708
AND SLEEP IN APATHY.

144
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,416
BUT THEN...

145
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,625
A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE
FROM CHILDHOOD,

146
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,333
GAVE ME THE STRENGTH
TO CARRY ON WITH MY LIFE.

147
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,500
SO, YOU SEE, I OWE HIM.

148
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,291
FOR GIVING ME THE COURAGE
I NEEDED TO VENTURE FORWARD.

149
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:51,083
I SWEAR IT. I GLADLY ACCEPT THE
MISSION WITH PRIDE, MY LIEGE.

150
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,375
- Iris: NEVER ONE TO MISS OUT
ON DOING WHATEVER HE PLEASED,

151
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,541
THE WICKED BEAST EVEN STIRRED
UP TROUBLE IN A TOMB.

152
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,875
HORSING AROUND CARELESSLY
WITH SHARP OBJECTS,

153
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,041
TRYING TO PLAY THE SYMPATHY CARD
BY GETTING BURNT TO A CRISP.

154
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,250
- Sion: SURELY THERE ARE BETTER
WAYS TO ELICIT SYMPATHY

155
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,916
THAN BY ROASTING ONE'S SELF.

156
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,125
- ( gasps ) RYNER!

157
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,583
- Ryner: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

158
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,208
YOU ENJOYED THAT.

159
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,750
- Iris: THE PRINCESS WAS ALERT
TO THE TOMB'S DANGERS AT ONCE,

160
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,041
AND DID HER BEST TO WARN
THE STUPID CREATURE.

161
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,416
- WHAT THE HELL?
- BEHIND YOU.

162
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,958
- Iris: SADLY, THE CUR WAS
AS DUMB AS HE WAS DERANGED,

163
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,916
SHOUTING TO HIS
WOULD-BE RESCUER.

164
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,916
- YOU ARE SO DEAD WHEN
I FIND A WAY OUT OF THIS.

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,625
- Iris: SO MUCH FOR GRATITUDE.

166
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:40,458
- NOT COOL, I COULD'VE BEEN...
- OH, ANGRY BUTTERFLIES.

167
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,166
- Ryner: WHO ARE YOU?

168
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,708
- I... ( gasps )

169
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,375
( screams )

170
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,958
- Sion: I'VE GOT
A TRIVIA QUESTION FOR YOU.

171
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:55,958
- Iris: UH... OH, DARN.
UM...

172
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,875
( Iris replies )

173
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,958
- Sion: CLOSE, BUT NOT QUITE.

174
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:03,166
- AND YOU ARE NONE OTHER THAN
OUR QUARRY, A TABOO BREAKER.

175
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,666
- ( Iris speaking )

176
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,833
- Sion: GETTING COLDER.

177
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,666
( Iris speaking )

178
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,250
- Sion: ONLY IF RYNER
WERE CAPTAIN.

179
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,666
- HUH?

180
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,458
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
FERRIS. BUT I'M STARVING.

181
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,250
- HMM. YOU KNOW, DANGO
WOULD BE THE PERFECT ANTIDOTE

182
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,541
TO THE AIR IN THIS PLACE.

183
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,666
- DON'T THINK
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

184
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,750
THAT SADISTIC TROLLOP HAS
FIENDISHLY ENSNARED YOU

185
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,916
BY HER WILES. IT'S OBVIOUS.

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,375
- BELIEVE IN YOURSELF,
YOU CAN BREAK FREE OF HER.

187
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,541
I'LL WHISK YOU AWAY TO SAFETY.

188
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,791
- I SEE, THIS LITTLE FIREBRAND
WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO BE ONE

189
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,375
OF YOUR MANY VICTIMS,

190
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,291
NOW WOULD SHE? SOMEONE YOU TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF AND LEFT FOR DEAD?

191
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,125
- ENOUGH WITH THE PERV THING!

192
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,958
- HEY, WAIT, I HAVEN'T BEEN
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.

193
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:48,291
- OH, SO SHE GAVE HERSELF
TO YOU WILLINGLY, MY MISTAKE.

194
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,750
- Both: NOTHING HAPPENED!

195
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,916
- THE TRUTH BECAME
ALL TOO PLAIN.

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,875
THE ELITE FORCE WAS LED BY ONE
OF THE BEAST'S EARLY VICTIMS,

197
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,250
WHO HE'D LEFT TO ROT.

198
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,750
THE PRINCESS
WORRIED THE BEAST

199
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:01,791
WOULD SOON SET HIS SIGHTS ON
HER OWN VIRTUE.

200
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,541
- TRUE TO HIS NATURE, I SUPPOSE.

201
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,458
THE MAN DOES LIKE TO
CAST HIS NETS WIDE.

202
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,708
- NOT LONG AFTER, A LETTER
TO HIS MAJESTY ARRIVED

203
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,125
FROM THE WICKED BEAST,

204
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,291
CLAIMING HE AND THE PRINCESS'
SEARCH FOR HERO RELICS

205
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,708
HAD BEEN RUDELY INTERRUPTED

206
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,500
BY A PAIR OF PINK-HAIRED BADDIES
FROM SOME DISTANT LAND

207
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,666
BENT ON STOPPING THEM
IN THEIR TRACKS.

208
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,416
I RECALL THAT LITTLE
MISSIVE ALL TOO WELL.

209
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,333
SADLY NOT A WORD OF IT
COULD BE VERIFIED.

210
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,500
- BE PREPARED. THE TREASURE
WE SEEK IS RIGHT HERE.

211
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:38,375
IF THEY OVERRUN US, BE READY
TO TAKE TO YOUR HEELS AND FLEE.

212
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,625
GO!

213
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,208
OH, NO. THIS CAN'T BE.

214
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,750
THERE'S NO TREASURE IN HERE,
IT'S JUST JUNK.

215
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,250
- WHAT? NO WAY.

216
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,208
- FESS UP! WHERE DID YOU HIDE
THE TREASURE, YOU ROGUE?

217
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,833
- THERE WAS NOTHING HERE
FOR US TO HIDE, MISSY.

218
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,666
- HOLD ON.

219
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,625
- WHAT ARE THE TWO
OF YOU DOING HERE?

220
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,583
- TRYING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF
THE RUMORED DRAGON, OF COURSE.

221
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,875
SO, WHAT DO YOU TWO
THINK IS GOING ON HERE?

222
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,916
- HEY, YOUR GUESS
IS AS GOOD AS MINE.

223
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,708
IT'S WEIRD THERE BEING NO
TELLTALE SIGNS OF BLOOD,

224
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,875
BUT... FERRIS?

225
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,666
- PERHAPS YOU TWO HAVE
YOUR OWN THEORY

226
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,833
AS TO THE NATURE OF THIS BEAST?

227
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,833
- SO YOU'RE OUT TO FIND
HERO RELICS AS WELL.

228
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,791
- THERE IS SO MUCH
YOU DON'T KNOW.

229
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,458
HERE, LET ME BEGIN
BY ILLUSTRATING

230
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,208
HOW THE RELIC YOU
ABANDONED IS USED.

231
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,500
- ( exclaiming in pain )

232
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,375
- WHAT I SEEK
IS THUNDER. IZUCHI!

233
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,666
- OH, PLEASE.

234
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,958
- DON'T TELL ME THAT'S
ANOTHER RELIC HE'S USING.

235
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,458
- SO SORRY.

236
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:09,666
IN ADDITION TO THE AILECRONO
SCYTHE KUU SO DEFTLY WIELDS,

237
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,875
AND OF COURSE, THE
DOLUELI SWORDSCALE,

238
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,958
WE HAVE THE ELEMIO COMB.

239
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,458
FOR A GRAND TOTAL OF THREE.

240
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,833
- WE MUST RETREAT. THE ODDS IN
THIS FIGHT ARE NOT IN OUR FAVOR.

241
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,916
MOVE IT, RYNER!

242
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,541
- ALL RIGHT FINE. RUN!

243
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,958
- RUN IF YOU MUST.
YOU WON'T GET FAR.

244
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,916
RESONATE!

245
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,916
- ( moans in pain )
- COME ON.

246
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,041
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
ARE YOU... HEY.

247
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,000
- Alpha Stigma: WHY DENY IT?

248
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:45,625
YOU WANT EVERYTHING TO JUST
CRUMBLE AND DISAPPEAR.

249
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,916
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HIM?

250
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,375
- DON'T BE CUTE. I CAN'T VERY
WELL STEAL THE ALPHA STIGMA

251
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,791
WITHOUT FIRST ROUSING IT.

252
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:53,875
- ROUSING WHAT?

253
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,125
- YOU MEAN YOU REALLY
HAVE NO IDEA.

254
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,750
OF ALL TABOOS, THE ALPHA
STIGMA IS THE MOST HATED.

255
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,375
ONCE AWAKENED
IT KNOWS NO RESTRAINT.

256
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,208
IT ANNIHILATES INDISCRIMINATELY.

257
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,208
HENCE IT'S BEARERS
ARE MALIGNED AS DEMONS.

258
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,250
- Alpha Stigma: YOU KNOW
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

259
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,000
- ( Ryner groaning )
YOU, YOU...

260
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,791
YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT
OF HERE, FERRIS!

261
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,041
RUN AS FAR AWAY
AS YOU CAN.

262
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,083
DON'T LOOK BACK, I CAN'T...

263
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,125
- WHAT IS THIS?

264
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:28,458
- ( grunts )
GET OUT OF HERE.

265
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,666
I CAN'T CONTROL MYSELF!

266
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:37,000
I'M A MONSTER.
I'LL... KILL...

267
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,583
I'LL KILL YOU.

268
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,458
- Alpha Stigma: SO WHAT?
PEOPLE DIE EVERYDAY.

269
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,333
WHAT DIFFERENCE
WILL ONE POSSIBLY MAKE?

270
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,041
- ( screams ) SHUT UP!

271
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:57,125
- JUST ACCEPT IT.
THE WORLD IS YOUR PLAYGROUND.

272
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,125
LET LOOSE. HAVE A FEW LAUGHS.

273
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,166
- ( screams )

274
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,208
- ( laughing )

275
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,750
- AND, THE FINAL TETHER
HAS SNAPPED.

276
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,541
THE ALPHA STIGMA IS AWAKE.

277
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,375
I'VE FREED HIM TO RAIN DOWN
CATASTROPHE LIKE A GOD.

278
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,208
- ( laughing )

279
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,833
- HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED ANYTHING?

280
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:28,125
I TOLD YOU, THE COMB
NULLIFIES YOUR STRENGTH.

281
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,375
THERE'S NO POINT
IN TRYING TO RESIST US.

282
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:37,208
- ANALYZE EXISTENCE AND
RELEASE. BE GONE, WORM.

283
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,666
- WHAT IN THE HELL? ( screams )

284
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,958
- BURN IT.

285
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,458
OH, MY...

286
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,000
WHAT ON EARTH IS HE?

287
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:05,125
AN ORDINARY ALPHA STIMGA BEARER
DOESN'T HAVE THIS KIND OF POWER.

288
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,250
- YOU REALLY THINK
YOUR KIND OF MAGIC

289
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,666
IS GOING TO GET
THE BETTER OF ME?

290
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,666
THE ELEMIO COMB MIGHT AS WELL
BE A CONJURER'S PROP.

291
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,625
LITTLE WORMS, CRAWLING IN DIRT.

292
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,833
( laughs )

293
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:24,083
WRITHE IN A FLASH AND BE GONE.
LET ALL RETURN TO NOTHING.

294
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:43,291
- THE LAST THING YOU'RE CAPABLE
OF DOING IS HURTING ME, RYNER.

295
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,083
DO YOU HEAR ME IN THERE,
MR. "RUN AWAY"?

296
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,833
I DO NOT PARTAKE OF DANGO,
DRINK TEA, OR CAVORT

297
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,791
WITH THE LIKES
OF HOMICIDAL DEMIGODS.

298
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,250
YOU'RE NOT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
LED TO BELIEVE YOU ARE.

299
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,916
OPEN YOUR EARS
AND LISTEN TO ME!

300
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
-Ryner: NO.

301
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:11,416
- Alpha Stigma: ALL OF YOU...

302
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,333
- Ryner: SHUT THE HELL UP.
EVERYTHING GOES BACK TO NOTHING.

303
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,208
YOUR TIME IS DONE.

304
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,041
- RYNER!

305
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,750
- ( screams )

306
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:35,875
- FERRIS, I'M SORRY.
YOU HAVE TO CLOSE MY EYES.

307
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,416
I CAN'T DO IT.

308
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,833
- RYNER, STOP.

309
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:51,708
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN.
YOU ARE NOT A MONSTER.

310
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,916
RYNER, YOU ARE NOT A MONSTER!

311
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,916
- ( screams )

312
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,458
- Iris: DESPITE THE PRINCESS'
BRAVE EFFORTS

313
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,250
TO KEEP THE WICKED BEAST
UNDER CONTROL,

314
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,708
HER HOPELESSLY DEPRAVED
COMPANION SOON SLIPPED BACK

315
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,291
INTO HIS VILE WAYS

316
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,958
AND PLUCKED A YOUNG BOY FROM THE
WARMTH AND SECURITY OF HIS HOME.

317
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,000
- IZUCHI!

318
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,958
- Iris: EVEN WORSE, HE
BRAINWASHED AND CRUELLY TWISTED

319
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,875
THE INNOCENT CHILD
INTO A WEAPON OF WAR.

320
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,125
THE PRINCESS WAS STRONGLY
AGAINST THIS, HOWEVER,

321
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,833
AND REFUSED TO LET THINGS STAND.

322
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,958
- MEDDLING WITH THE VERY
STRUCTURE OF YOUR SPELLS...

323
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,166
- KUKU, WAKE UP!
- ARUA.

324
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,500
- Iris: THE PRINCESS
FREED THE POOR BOY

325
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,291
FROM THE WICKED BEAST'S CLUTCHES

326
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,750
AND DELIVERED HIM SAFE
AND SOUND TO THE CARE

327
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,791
OF HIS MAJESTY'S ELITE FORCE.

328
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,791
KINDNESS AND BRAVERY
WON THE DAY!

329
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,125
- ( laughs )

330
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:56,291
- WHAT I SEEK
IS THUNDER, IZUCHI!

331
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,916
- WHOA! HEY, CUT IT OUT!

332
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,958
- Luke: PLEASE, CAPTAIN MILK,
CALM YOURSELF!

333
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,375
GET IT TOGETHER, CAPTAIN!

334
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,208
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, FUNBOY!

335
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,500
- WHERE THE HELL
IS THIS COMING FROM, HUH?

336
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,250
FERRIS?

337
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,458
- INDEED, THE DANGO PREPARED
AT THE WYNNIT HOUSE

338
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,333
ARE ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL.

339
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,541
- WHOA, WHERE DID YOU
GET THOSE FROM?

340
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,208
- WELL, I BOUGHT
THEM, OBVIOUSLY.

341
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,000
WE ARE WITHIN ROLAND'S
BORDERS, AFTER ALL.

342
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,000
- WHAT?
- IT'S HOUSE ERIS,

343
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,625
A TERRITORY OF MY
FAMILY POSITIONED

344
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,375
ALONG THE COASTAL REGION.

345
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,166
- ALL RIGHT! HOW ABOUT WE
DESTROY THE ROOT OF EVIL

346
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,750
THAT PUT US THROUGH THIS TORMENT

347
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,791
AND BE DONE WITH IT, HUH?

348
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,208
- YES, ON THE DAWN OF HIS
DEFEAT, LIKE A SUN RISING,

349
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,583
I SHALL TAKE HIS PLACE.

350
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,791
AND I SHALL MAKE ROLAND
INTO THE DANGO EMPIRE.

351
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,375
- Iris: WHEN THE SIMPLE LITTLE
MISSION GIVEN TO HIM BY THE KING

352
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,125
AT LAST PROVED
TOO MUCH TO HANDLE,

353
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:48,208
THE STUPID, VILE, LAZY,
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING, WICKED BEAST

354
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,875
WAS FORCED TO CRAWL
BACK HOME EMPTY HANDED.

355
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,291
- THANK YOU, IRIS.

356
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,375
THAT REPORT WAS AS DELIGHTFUL
AS IT WAS INFORMATIVE.

357
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,791
I WONDER HOW FAR
THE WICKED BEAST

358
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,208
HAS COME ITEMIZING
THEIR EXPENSES.

359
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,333
- ( sighs )

360
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,333
- OKAY, SO... WHAT THE HELL?

361
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,083
THAT WAS... AND THEN THIS.

362
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,291
BUT THEN THOSE... HOLD ON.

363
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,291
WHOA, WHOA. WHAT?

364
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:18,375
REALLY? OH, NO, NO.

365
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,208
YOU ARE KIDDING ME?

366
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,125
SON OF A...

367
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,333
THAT'S INSANE!

368
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,375
NO ONE CAN EAT THAT MUCH DANGO.

369
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,291
DOES SHE HAVE MORE THAN
ONE FREAKING STOMACH?

370
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,083
SHE'S BLOWN THROUGH
MOST OF OUR BUDGET!

371
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,875
IT'S LIKE SHE'S THE
DANGO- CHOWING EQUIVALENT

372
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,666
OF THE ELEMIO COMB.

373
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,208
- HOW DARE YOU TALK
ABOUT MY SISTER LIKE THAT?

374
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,583
- ( screams )

375
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,000
- ( grunts )

376
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,791
- STOP HITTING ME.

377
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:53,833
- HUH. YOU SEEM TO HAVE RACKED
UP QUITE A LOT OF FOOD EXPENSES.

378
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,541
OH, UH. AND THE COST
OF REPAIRING THAT CHAIR

379
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,208
WILL COME OUT OF YOUR WAGES.

380
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,916
- WHAT? HEY! THAT'S SO UNFAIR.

381
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,458
FERRIS, THOUGH... AND I...
BUT THE CHAIR WASN'T EVEN...

382
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,250
- IRIS ATTACK!

383
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,666
- WHAT'S LEFT OF YOUR
TAKE-HOME PAY IS DIMINISHING.

384
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,166
- YEAH, WELL,

385
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,416
YOUR CHANCES OF ME NOT KICKING
YOUR ASS ARE DIMINISHING.

386
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,083
- ( laughs )

387
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:18,666
NO ONE DEFEATS IRIS.
GO ON, SIR. SAY IT.

388
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,666
- YOU'VE DONE WELL.
THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND,

389
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,666
YOUR SISTER WILL BE PROUD.

390
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,166
- ( laughs excitedly )

391
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,541
- BE SURE TO MENTION
HOW HARD I WAS ON THE BEAST.

392
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,125
SHE'LL BE PROUD OF THAT
MOST OF ALL!

393
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,125
- OH, NO.

394
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,083
- I'D BEEN SO PREOCCUPIED
WITH OUR MISSION,

395
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,000
I DIDN'T CONSUME ENOUGH DANGO.

396
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,750
I HAVEN'T MANAGED TO PUT AWAY
EVEN HALF MY NORMAL AMOUNT.

397
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,833
THAT EXPLAINS WHY I'VE HAD
SO LITTLE ENERGY.

398
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,333
WHAT A FOOL I'VE BEEN.

399
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,375
WELL, THE FAMINE ENDS NOW.

400
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,250
THEY SAY INDULGING
IN DANGO JUST BEFORE BED

401
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,583
IS A SURE FIRE WAY TO LOOSE
ONE'S GIRLISH FIGURE.

402
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,333
BUT SURELY HAVING TO DEAL
WITH IDIOTS ALL DAY

403
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,833
EXEMPTS ME FROM
HAVING TO ABSTAIN.

404
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,083
( moans )

405
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,333
I HAVEN'T PARTAKEN IN THE WYNITT
TEA HOUSE VARIETY IN SO LONG.

406
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,541
OH, YES. NOW, I AM TRULY
IN MY ELEMENT.

407
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,375
- ( cries with joy )

408
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,375
- ( theme song playing )
