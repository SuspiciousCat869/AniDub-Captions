1
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,250
- ( maniacal laughter )

2
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:27,041
- AND, THE FINAL
TETHER HAS SNAPPED.

3
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,375
- ( continues laughing )

4
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,333
- I TOLD YOU. THE COMB
NULLIFIES YOUR STRENGTH.

5
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,750
THERE'S NO POINT
IN TRYING TO RESIST US.

6
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,875
AAH! WHAT IN THE HELL?

7
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:43,083
( screaming )

8
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,333
- ( Ferris screaming )

9
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,166
- BURN IT!

10
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:55,916
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE, KUU.
WHATEVER HE IS, WE'RE TRUMPED!

11
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,458
- ( theme song playing )

12
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,500
- ( breathing heavily )

13
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,416
- Ferris: WHO OR WHAT ARE YOU?

14
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,541
- MONSTER. DEVIL. GOD. HERO.

15
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,708
CALL ME WHAT YOU WILL.

16
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,791
YOU'LL CEASE TO EXIST
SOON ENOUGH, WORM.

17
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,333
- ( explosion )

18
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:58,708
- WELL, YOU CERTAINLY TERRIFIED
THE PINK-HAIRED FELLOW.

19
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,458
BUT THE FACT THAT THERE
IS MORE TO YOUR POWER

20
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,500
THAN MEETS THE EYE

21
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,625
ISN'T, TO ME, ALL THAT SHOCKING.

22
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,958
I MEAN, AFTER ALL
IT STANDS TO REASON,

23
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,541
GIVEN HOW EXCEPTIONAL
YOU ARE IN OTHER RESPECTS,

24
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,875
PARTICULARLY THE FIELD
OF GENERAL IDLENESS

25
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,708
AND WANTON SEXUAL PERVERSION.

26
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,416
- ( explosions )

27
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,041
- I'VE NEVER TOLD YOU,
BUT I ACTUALLY HAD THE CHANCE

28
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,625
TO PORE OVER
YOUR LITTLE TREATISE

29
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,416
AFTER SION HAD IT
SECRETLY COPIED.

30
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,291
A SPECIFIC PASSAGE STOOD
OUT TO ME, AS I RECALL.

31
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,333
"WE WOULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN VERY FAR

32
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,083
"IF DEEP DOWN PEOPLE WEREN'T
JUST AS LOATH TO KILL

33
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,708
AS THEY ARE TO DIE.

34
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,666
"WAR FORCES THEM TO CHOOSE
ONE OVER THE OTHER.

35
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,416
"HIGHBORN OR LOW,
NO ONE WANTS TO SOW MISERY."

36
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,291
ONLY AN IDEALISTIC SIMPLETON

37
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,333
COULD'VE SCRIBBLED
TRIPE LIKE THAT.

38
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:47,125
LOATH OR NOT,
PEOPLE KILL, PEOPLE DIE.

39
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,708
THAT'S THE WORLD.

40
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,125
IF SOMEONE LIVES, YOU CAN BET
IT'S BECAUSE SOME POOR FOOL'S

41
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,375
TAKEN THEIR PLACE
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

42
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,416
OF COURSE, I CAN SEE WHERE

43
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,250
A TIMID LITTLE
PRETTY BOY LIKE YOU

44
00:03:56,333 --> 00:04:00,083
WOULD STRUGGLE WITH SUCH
A PAINFULLY OBVIOUS FACT.

45
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,375
I FIND IT IRONIC THAT YOU'D
HARBOR SUCH REMORSE OVER KILLING

46
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,583
WHEN CLEARLY YOU'RE
NOT MUCH OF A KILLER.

47
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,500
SEE. LOOK AT YOU.

48
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,250
I HAVE INSULTED YOU TO YOUR FACE
AND STILL YOU STAND THERE.

49
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:20,291
NO MONSTER WORTHY OF THE NAME
WOULD TAKE SO MUCH ABUSE.

50
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,541
YOU PINE ABOUT HOW MUCH
DEATH AND DESTRUCTION

51
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,583
YOU'VE SOWN, AND YET HERE
I'VE DODGED YOUR ATTACK

52
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,375
NO LESS THAN FIVE TIMES.

53
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,958
I'LL MAKE A DEAL
WITH YOU, THOUGH.

54
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,625
YOUR NEXT ATTACK,
I WON'T DODGE.

55
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,958
- ( explosion )

56
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:41,500
- THE LAST THING YOU'RE CAPABLE
OF DOING IS HURTING ME, RYNER.

57
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,333
DO YOU HEAR ME IN THERE,
MR. RUN AWAY?

58
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,125
I DO NOT PARTAKE
OF DANGO, DRINK TEA,

59
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,958
OR CAVORT WITH THE LIKES
OF HOMICIDAL DEMIGODS.

60
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,250
YOU'RE NOT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
LED TO BELIEVE YOU ARE.

61
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,875
- ( pulsating )

62
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,750
- OPEN YOUR EARS
AND LISTEN TO ME!

63
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,208
- NO.

64
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,833
ALL OF YOU

65
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,375
SHUT THE HELL UP!

66
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:15,666
EVERYTHING GOES BACK TO NOTHING.
YOU'RE TIME IS DONE.

67
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,916
- RYNER!

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,333
- ( explosion )

69
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,791
- ( screaming )

70
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:34,416
- FERRIS, I'M SORRY.
YOU HAVE TO CLOSE MY EYES.

71
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,458
I CAN'T DO IT.

72
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:42,250
- ( groaning )

73
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,916
( gasping ) RYNER, STOP.

74
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,416
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN.

75
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,916
YOU ARE NOT...
A MONSTER.

76
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,916
YOU ARE NOT A MONSTER!

77
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,833
( Ferris breathing heavily )

78
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,666
- Ryner: I WAS THIS CLOSE TO
SNUFFING YOUR LIFE OUT

79
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,208
LIKE A CANDLE.

80
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,375
YOU SEE WHAT I AM.

81
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,666
PEOPLE ARE RIGHT TO DESPISE ME.

82
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,000
MY ONLY TALENT IS
FOR WREAKING DEVASTATION.

83
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,833
I'M TIRED OF MURDERING PEOPLE
WHO'VE HAD THE MISFORTUNE

84
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,583
OF GETTING CLOSE TO ME.

85
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:33,125
THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU
TO GO BACK HOME.

86
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,000
THE MISSION IS
NULL AND VOID NOW.

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,875
I THINK SION WILL UNDERSTAND.

88
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,041
- Ferris: IF YOU REALLY
INTENDED TO KILL ME,

89
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,625
YOU'D HAVE DONE IT. PERIOD.

90
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,333
BUT I'M STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE.

91
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,166
WHAT KIND OF A MONSTER
LETS A WOMAN

92
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,958
HURL INSULTS AT HIM? SERIOUSLY?

93
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,083
I'LL BE JUST FINE.

94
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:56,958
NOW, UNLESS MY MEMORY FAILS ME,
WE WERE ABOUT TO HAVE TEA.

95
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,750
BELIEVE IT OR NOT I STILL HAVE
SOME OF THE DANGO LEFT

96
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:06,916
THAT IRIS BROUGHT ME.

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,208
- ( Ryner crying )

98
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,541
- SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

99
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,541
- I SAY

100
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,708
I'M HOME.

101
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,083
Ryner: "IN A FOREST
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF NELPHA,

102
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:38,666
"TWO PEOPLE OF UNKNOWN
ORIGINS, ONE MALE, ONE FEMALE,

THE DOLUELI SWORDSCALE.

104

"WHICH I BELIEVE POINTS

- ( knock on door )

111
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,416
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

112
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,833
HOW MANY HOURS DO YOU INTEND
TO WORK WITHOUT TAKING A BREAK?

113
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,625
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN TOUCHED YOUR MEAL!

114
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,250
- SORRY, ESLINA.

115
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,291
AS SOON AS I COME
TO A DECENT STOPPING POINT,

116
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,625
I'LL EAT SOMETHING.

117
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,875
- NOT A DAY GOES BY
WHEN YOU DON'T PROMISE THAT.

118
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,958
- YEAH. OR SIT THERE MOPING
WITH THAT LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

119
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,291
WHAT IS IT THIS TIME?

120
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,666
- NOTHING ANYONE NEED
CONCERN THEMSELVES WITH,

I ASSURE YOU.

122

00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:23,750
THINKING YOU CAN SHOULDER
THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD

124
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,000
ALL BY YOURSELF.

125
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,791
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
DRIVE US ALL CRAZY.

126
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,375
- ESLINA, WHEN THE KING
SHACKLES HIMSELF

127
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,666
TO THE WORKLOAD,
UNLESS HE'S PHYSICALLY STOPPED

128
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,208
HE'LL BURROW THROUGH
THE WHOLE PILE.

129
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,041
THAT'S WHERE YOU STAGE
AN INTERVENTION.

130
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,541
- DON'T WORRY. I'M ON IT.

131
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:40,041
- I AM SITTING RIGHT HERE.
- DON'T BELLYACHE, YOUR MAJESTY.

132
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,458
WE DON'T WANT FIOLE TO FEEL LIKE
HE HAS TO COME BACK DOWN HERE

133
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,833
TO SET THINGS STRAIGHT.

134
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,458
RIGHT, MADAM SECRETARY?

135
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,750
- EXACTLY! DON'T DISTURB
MY BROTHER'S REST!

136
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,375
TAKE A BREAK FROM WORK
THIS INSTANT AND EAT SOMETHING!

137
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,083
- ( chuckling )

138
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,708
- I SEE ROLAND'S KING
IS WELL LOOKED AFTER.

139
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,375
IT'S VERY HEARTENING TO FIND
YOUR SUPPORTERS SO PASSIONATE.

140
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,583
- AH, WELCOME, LADY NOA.

141
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,000
I HOPE ADJUSTING TO LIFE HERE
HASN'T PROVED TOO DIFFICULT?

142
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,000
- OH, NO. NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST.

143
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,500
I ASSURE YOUR MAJESTY I'VE HAD
A VERY PLEASANT STAY THUS FAR.

144
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,708
ADMIRAL KLOM TAKES
GREAT PAINS TO SEE

145
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:10,458
THAT I AM MADE COMFORTABLE.

146
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,958
- ( Claugh chokes )

147
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,708
- WELL, HE DOES ENJOY HIS WORK.

148
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,458
- IT APPEARS YOUR
MAJESTY'S INSTINCT

149
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,416
FOR ASSIGNING ADMIRAL KLOM
TO HER LADYSHIP HAS PANNED OUT.

150
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
- I'M INCLINED TO AGREE.

151
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,250
- HEY, THAT'S ENOUGH
OF THAT TALK.

152
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,833
- UH, THE LADY HAS
PRESSING BUSINESS.

153
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,125
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

154
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,833
I HAVE NO BUSINESS TO SPEAK OF.

155
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,125
YOU AND I MADE DINNER
ARRANGEMENTS THIS EVENING,

156
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,041
DID WE NOT?

157
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,333
- DINNER, YEAH, RIGHT.

158
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,208
- Calne: REALLY? I THOUGHT
YOU SAID YOU HAD

159
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,041
A RECEPTION TONIGHT.

160
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,125
- ACTUALLY IT GOT POSTPONED!

161
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,666
THEY DECIDED TO HOLD IT
TOMORROW NIGHT

162
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,250
INSTEAD 'CAUSE OF
THAT OTHER THING.

163
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,875
- Calne: AH! OF COURSE,
OF COURSE.

164
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,708
- SO, UH. YEAH. I WAS GOING TO
HAVE TO CANCEL, BUT THEN...

165
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,208
- ( giggles )
IT'S PERFECTLY FINE.

166
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,916
YOU'RE A VERY
BUSY MAN, ADMIRAL.

167
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,500
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO KEEP ME APPRISED

168
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,875
OF EVERY SINGLE
LITTLE ENGAGEMENT.

169
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,958
- NOW, CALNE, YOU, UH...
AREN'T TELLING HER LADYSHIP

170
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,208
ANYTHING SHE DOESN'T
NEED TO KNOW, ARE YOU?

171
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,250
- MY GOODNESS, ADMIRAL,

172
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,208
WHAT EVER ARE
YOU KEEPING FROM ME?

173
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,791
- ( chuckles nervously )
NOTHING!

174
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,000
- ( Calne groaning )

175
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,208
- WELL I'LL BE VERY INTERESTED
TO HEAR ABOUT THIS "NOTHING"

176
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,666
OVER DINNER TONIGHT, THEN.

177
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,000
FOR WHICH PURPOSE, SIR,

178
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,083
I DO HOPE THAT YOU DON'T MIND
MY BORROWING HIM.

179
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,250
- HE'S ALL YOURS, MY LADY.

180
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,333
- Calne: THERE WAS NO
CALL FOR THAT.

181
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,333
- ( clears throat )

182
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,166
- ( sighs )

183
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,791
- GOOD THING FOR HIM,
THERE'S NO ACCOUNTING FOR TASTE.

184
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,666
- LADY NOA HAS BECOME
AN UNWITTING HOSTAGE

185
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,500
OF THE ILL-CONCEIVED
ESTABULIAN UPRISING.

186
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,291
I THOUGHT HAVING CLAUGH
AT HER SIDE,

187
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,916
MIGHT OFFER HER LADYSHIP
A MEASURE OF HOPE.

188
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,541
- WELL, SIR, SHE SEEMS
RATHER CHEERFUL.

189
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,208
- ( knock on door )

190
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,250
- ( scoffs )

191
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,958
Miran: HAS YOUR GRACE YET
HAD A MOMENT

192
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,458
TO READ THROUGH MY PROPOSAL?

193
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,375
- Sion: I HAVE. YES.

194
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,125
AND IT WOULD SEEM
THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES

195
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,916
ARE IN DIRE STRAITS INDEED.

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,458
- IMPERIAL STOHL BOASTS
FORMIDABLE FORCES

197
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,375
IN THE REGION, AS YOU KNOW.

198
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,916
BUT THE NEWLY EMERGENT
ROYAL FAMILY OF GASTARK

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,416
IN THE NORTHERNMOST TERRITORY

200
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,750
HAS SPEARHEADED
THE ANNEXATION

201
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,166
OF NUMEROUS VASSAL
KINGDOMS AS OF LATE.

202
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,750
WITH PREDATORY SWIFTNESS,
ONE MIGHT SAY.

203
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,250
THE DELICATE EQUILIBRIUM
OF MENORIS HAS BEGUN TO STAGGER.

204
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,958
FULL-SCALE WAR IS
ALMOST CERTAINLY IMMINENT.

205
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,666
IN WHICH CASE
OUR FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS

206
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,500
IS TO SOLIDIFY THE HOME FRONT.

207
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,125
IF WE CANNOT MANAGE TO BIND
THE COUNTRY TOGETHER INTERNALLY

208
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,166
BY HOLDING THE
ERRANT NOBILITY IN CHECK,

209
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,500
WE SHALL FALL

210
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,125
AND THE RAVAGING VORTEX
OF UNREST WILL CONSUME US.

211
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,000
TO THAT END,
WHAT IS CALLED FOR,

212
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,125
IS A POLITICAL PURGE.

213
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,666
THAT WOULD BE
THE SUREST ROUTE

214
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,916
TO THE KINGDOM'S
STABILIZATION, YES.

215
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,583
- SUCH AN EXTREME MEASURE...

216
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,750
- A MEASURE YOUR LEGACY AS
A RULER WILL COME TO ECLIPSE.

217
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,875
KEEP YOUR OWN HOUSE IN
ORDER AS THE MAELSTROM

218
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,083
RAGES WITHOUT, SIR...

219
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,083
AND THE COMMON STOCK OF
MENORIS WILL FLOCK

220
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,333
TO ROLAND'S HOLDFOR SHELTER.

221
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,916
BUT ONLY OF COURSE
IF BY THAT TIME

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,125
ROLAND ITSELF HAS NOT
SUCCUMBED IRREPARABLY

223
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,750
TO THE MAELSTROM RAGING WITHIN.

224
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,583
AGAIN, SIR, IF I HAVE VENTURED
TOO FAR TOO SOON,

225
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,958
I'M DUTY-BOUND TO STOP
AT YOUR COMMAND.

226
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,250
DUKE STEARIED.

227
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,666
- Stearied: ONE CANNOT TRAVERSE
A HALLWAY ANYMORE

228
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,750
WITHOUT HEARING TELL
OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

229
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,875
I WISHED TO SPEAK
WITH YOU IN PERSON,

230
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,791
TO REASSURE MYSELF THAT
NOT EVERYONE

231
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,083
IN HIS MAJESTY'S CABINET

232
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,250
HAS BEEN PLUCKED
FROM THE LOWER CLASSES.

233
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,041
I HOPE YOU WILL
FORGIVE MY CANDOR.

234
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,583
- I APPRECIATE THE VOTE
OF CONFIDENCE, MY LORD.

235
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,625
I HAVE DESIRED TO SHARE
WORDS WITH YOU AS WELL.

236
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,458
- HAVE YOU INDEED? EXCELLENT.

237
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,125
MAY I THEN ASK YOUR OPINION

238
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,958
OF THE YOUNG KING'S
STATESMANSHIP?

239
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,166
- Miran: WELL, TO BE HONEST,

240
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,500
HIS TENDENCY TO
DISREGARD THE OPINIONS

241
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:45,000
OF THOSE MORE EXPERIENCED
IS A BIT DISPIRITING.

242
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,333
HIS MAJESTY IS ONLY YIELDING

243
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,083
WHERE IT SEEMS MOST
PERILOUS TO BE SO.

244
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,333
- I THOUGHT AS MUCH.
NO DOUBT THEN, SIR,

245
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,583
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE TO WHOSE
BULWARK IT WOULD BE

246
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,791
MORE ADVANTAGEOUS
FOR YOU TO ALIGN.

247
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,166
THERE'S A GALLING DEARTH
OF MEN LIKE YOU

248
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,000
AMONG OUR ILK
IN THE NOBLE CLASS.

249
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,833
AGREE TO PART COMPANY WITH
HIS MAJESTY AND JOIN OUR RANKS.

250
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,875
AND WHATEVER PRICE
YOU CARED TO NAME

251
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,625
WOULD BE OURS
TO HONOR, LEST WE...

252
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,250
- IF THERE IS, AS YOU SAY,

253
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,041
A GALLING DEARTH OF MEN
LIKE ME IN YOUR CLASS,

254
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,208
YOU CERTAINLY PROVE THE RULE.

255
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:19,041
WHATEVER PRICE I CARE TO NAME?
YOU CANNOT AFFORD ME.

256
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,375
WHAT I REQUIRE IS SOMETHING
I HAVE FAITH ONLY IN

257
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,958
SION ASTALL TO GIVE...

258
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,375
YOU EGREGIOUSLY MISINTERPRET
MY RESERVATIONS

259
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,583
AS AN OVERTURE TO BETRAYAL

260
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,166
BECAUSE YOU, SIR,
ARE AN IMBECILE.

261
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,125
AN IMBECILE MY KING
IS TOO WILLING TO ENDURE.

262
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,708
HE WOULD SPARE THE VERY INSECTS
CRAWLING BENEATH HIS FEET.

263
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,541
WHICH IS WHY I AM HERE
TO ACT ON HIS BEHALF.

264
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:42,625
TO GRIND EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM
INTO THE COBBLESTONES.

265
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,458
SO, I BELIEVE
THE PROPER QUESTION IS,

266
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,708
TO WHOSE BULWARK
WILL YOU ALIGN, SIR?

267
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,708
- ( gasps )

268
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:55,291
- THE OLD POWERS THAT WHITTLE
THIS KINGDOM AWAY TO NOTHING,

269
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,791
OR MY KING?

270
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,291
- Noa: IT'S GETTING
RATHER LATE, ISN'T IT?

271
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,791
- Claugh: I HOPE YOUR LADYSHIP
ISN'T CROSS WITH ME

272
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,916
FOR THE CHARADE EARLIER?

273
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,083
- CROSS?

274
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,291
COME NOW, ADMIRAL KLOM,

275
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,875
DO I TRULY STRIKE YOU
AS THE SORT OF WOMAN

276
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,958
TO WAX PEEVISH OVER
SUCH TRIFLES?

277
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,791
- NO, NO.
IT'S JUST THAT SOMETIMES

278
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,000
A WOMAN MEANS ONE
THING AND SAYS ANOTHER.

279
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,666
- OH? YOU SEEM
ALARMINGLY WELL-VERSED

280
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,916
IN THE WAYS OF THE FAIRER SEX,
MY DEAR ADMIRAL.

281
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,750
- AGAIN WITH
THE "ADMIRAL" THING.

282
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,875
LOOK YOU CAN DROP THE
FORMALITIES AROUND ME,

283
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:27,583
ALL RIGHT?

284
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,000
CLAUGH WORKS JUST FINE.

285
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,375
- ( giggling )

286
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,041
HOW COULD ANY WOMAN
EVER BE CROSS WITH YOU?

287
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,375
I PROMISE I'M NOT UPSET
IN THE SLIGHTEST.

288
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,958
I'M SIMPLY NOT ACCUSTOMED
TO BEING OUT-OF-DOORS THIS LATE.

289
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,166
CERTAINLY NOT BENEATH
SO LOVELY A NIGHT SKY.

290
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,333
- IS IT REALLY
ALL THAT STRIKING?

291
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,833
I MEAN IT'S THE SAME SKY
OVER ESTABUL, ISN'T IT?

292
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,916
- WELL, THE VIEW IS SIMILAR
FOR EVERYONE, I SUPPOSE.

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,500
BUT THE SENSE OF IT CHANGES,

294
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,458
DEPENDING ON WHOM
ONE VIEWS IT WITH.

295
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,291
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

296
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,500
- HUH, SURE. WHY NOT?

297
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,833
- YOU ARE A CREDIT TO THE
KINGDOM YOU SERVE, ADMIRAL KLOM.

298
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,375
- I AM PLEASED TO KNOW YOU.
- HMM?

299
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:10,083
- UH, BY THAT I MEAN ONLY TO
EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE.

300
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,208
I'VE HAD SUCH FUN WITH YOU.

301
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,666
MY APOLOGIES FOR STAYING...

302
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:22,791
( gasps )

303
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:24,791
( whimpers )

304
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,208
- YOU'RE A CLEVER WOMAN,
MY LADY.

305
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,666
I THINK YOU CAN APPRECIATE
THE POSITION THIS PUTS YOU IN.

306
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,291
- IF I SCREAM,
YOU'LL MURDER ALL OF US?

307
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,375
IS THAT HOW
THE SITUATION STANDS?

308
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,958
- EXACTLY.

309
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,958
OR IF YOU'RE HEADSTRONG ENOUGH
NOT TO COMPLY WITH MY DEMANDS.

310
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,708
NOW STRIP!

311
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,500
- UGH! MAYBE ONE OF THESE DAYS

312
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,833
I'LL UNDERSTAND
A WOMAN'S THINKING.

313
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,250
- Noa: CLAUGH!

314
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,666
- DRIVER, STOP!

315
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,333
DAMN IT!

316
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,625
NOA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

317
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,375
( groaning )

318
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,291
- ( man groaning )

319
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,500
- ( Noa crying )

320
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,083
- WHAT HAVE YOU BASTARDS DONE?

321
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,291
- NOTHING, YET.
- NOTHING?

322
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,458
THEN WHY IS HER LADYSHIP CRYING?

323
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,458
- PRETTY NASTY WOUND YOU'VE GOT.

324
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,791
YOU SURE YOU WANT TO
PUSH THIS RIGHT NOW?

325
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,000
- MY WOUND IS NOT
THE ISSUE HERE.

326
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,500
I ASKED YOU WHY IN THE HELL
THE WOMAN IN MY CARE

327
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,166
IS ON THE FLOOR CRYING!

328
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,000
WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER!

329
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,583
( grunting )

330
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,458
- I'D SAY ONCE WE'VE MADE IT
OVER THE SUMMIT

331
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,250
THE MOUNTAIN PATH
SHOULD GIVE A GOOD VIEW

332
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,791
OF OUR NEXT DESTINATION...

333
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,583
RUMOR HAS IT THE TOWN OF
REGIT IS DEMON-HAUNTED.

334
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,000
AND WHERE THERE'S
A WHISPER OF DEMONS

335
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,125
A HERO RELIC CAN'T BE FAR...

336
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,208
RIGHT?

337
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,166
- HMM.

338
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,458
( screams )

339
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,833
( groans )

340
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,166
- ON YOUR FEET, PRETTY BOY.

341
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,750
- HUH?

342
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,833
- THE FATE OF THE WYNNIT TEA
HOUSE IS IN OUR HANDS, RYNER.

343
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,916
I HOPE YOU APPRECIATE THAT.

344
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,708
FORGING WORLD PEACE
MAY BE A PIPE DREAM,

345
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,541
BUT PRESERVING THE INTEGRITY
OF DANGO IS NOTHING TO SCOFF AT.

346
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,375
- YOU AND YOUR
OBSESSION WITH DANGO...

347
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,416
INSPIRES ME TO BECOME
THE CAUSE'S FOREMOST CHAMPION.

348
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,041
- ( chuckles )

349
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,541
- ( chuckles )

350
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,750
WOULDN'T KILL US TO
SLOW DOWN A LITTLE THOUGH.

351
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,250
- ( girl screaming )

352
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,875
- GET BACK HERE YOU LITTLE BRAT!

353
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,083
- DON'T BE STUPID!

354
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,708
YOU'RE ONLY MAKING THIS
HARDER ON ALL OF US!

355
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:11,083
- LET GO! STOP IT!
NO! SOMEBODY HELP!

356
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,041
- KNOCK IT OFF!

357
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,666
- ( girl screams )

358
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,583
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH
TROUBLE YOU'VE STIRRED UP?

359
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,583
- IS BEATING UP
A DEFENSELESS LITTLE GIRL

360
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,500
REALLY THE FIRST IMPRESSION
YOU WANT TO MAKE

361
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,500
ON A TOTAL STRANGER?

362
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,875
- WHO ASKED YOU
TO GET INVOLVED...

363
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:23,916
( groans )

364
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,625
- ( groans )

365
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,833
- THOSE GUYS DIDN'T
HURT YOU, DID THEY?

366
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,416
- I CAN'T DO IT ALONE!
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME!

367
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
- JUST CALM DOWN.

368
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,708
- LISTEN TO ME!
WE HAVE TO RESCUE HIM!

369
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,875
PLEASE, MISTER... ARUA'S
NOT BAD, HE'S JUST DIFFERENT!

370
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,166
- ARUA?

371
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,333
- HE'S NOT A MONSTER.
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

372
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,458
( crying )

373
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,500
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT
THAT HE'S THE WAY HE IS.

374
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,541
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME RESCUE HIM
BEFORE THEY DO SOMETHING!

375
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,083
- Sion: ATTACKED?

376
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,458
WHAT HAPPENED? HAS SHE
BEEN INJURED IN ANY WAY?

377
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,041
- THANKS TO THE FORTUITOUS
INTERCESSION OF ADMIRAL KLOM,

378
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,625
WHO HAPPENED TO BE NEARBY,

379
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,250
LADY NOA IS SHAKEN,
BUT UNHARMED.

380
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,500
HER PRESENCE HERE HAS BEEN KEY
IN SETTING ROLAND AND ESTABUL

381
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,625
ON THE PATH TO RECONCILIATION.

382
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,375
HAD SHE BEEN KILLED
IN TONIGHT'S ASSAULT,

383
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,416
THE NEWLY HEALED SCHISM
BETWEEN OUR KINGDOMS

384
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,750
WOULD HAVE REOPENED.

385
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,833
YOU, AS HER PROTECTOR,

386
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:21,791
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FOCAL
POINT OF POPULAR REVOLT.

387
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,416
- I SHOULD HAVE
EXPECTED THIS OF THEM.

388
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,291
SHE WAS THEIRS FOR THE
PICKING, AND I KNEW IT!

389
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,083
THE NOBILITY HOLDS NOTHING
SACRED IN THEIR WAR AGAINST ME

390
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,875
SAVE WHAT INCREASES THEIR
LANDS OR LINES THEIR PURSES.

391
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,916
- IF THEY CANNOT BE
CIRCUMNAVIGATED,

392
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,875
WHAT PATH THEN
LAYS BEFORE YOU?

393
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,833
- THE PATH THAT
YOU HAVE SHOWN ME?

394
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,833
- FOR YOUR HIGHNESS
TO FOLLOW THAT ROAD,

395
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,083
YOU MUST FIRST
BREAK BREAD WITH THE ENEMY.

396
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,125
INGRATIATE YOURSELF TO
THE NOBILITY

397
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,708
YOU SO VEHEMENTLY
AND RIGHTLY DESPISE.

398
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:50,041
LET THEM NOT SUSPECT YOUR HEART,
EVEN WHEN A LIFE IS AT STAKE.

399
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,625
ERODE THEIR DEFENSES
WITH CHARM, AND THEN...

400
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,750
- SLAUGHTER THE LOT OF THEM?
- IF IT COMES TO IT, YES.

401
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,541
- WHAT OF THE PEOPLE?

402
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,958
IN THE TIME IT TAKES ME TO WIN,

403
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,916
TO BEAT THE NOBLES
AT THEIR OWN GAME...

404
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,250
HOW MANY WILL STARVE TO DEATH?

405
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,666
- WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

406
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,750
EVERYTHING IS IN READINESS,
YOUR GRACE.

407
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:13,458
I HUMBLY AWAIT
YOUR PLEASURE TO UTILIZE ME.

408
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:17,541
- ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE INDIGNITY ON LADY NOA?

409
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,875
- WHILE I FIND IT ENCOURAGING
THAT YOUR MAJESTY THINKS

410
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,708
SO CUNNING A
CROSS-PURPOSE WORTHY OF ME,

411
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:25,791
I MUST SADLY CONFESS TO HAVING
NO HAND IN THIS AFFAIR.

412
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,625
- LEAVE ME.
- SIR.

413
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,291
- ARUA'S BEEN
MY BEST FRIEND FOREVER.

414
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,083
AND FOR A LONG TIME
EVERYTHING WAS FINE.

415
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,166
THEN OUR LORD
RAISED TAXES SO HIGH

416
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,791
WE COULDN'T AFFORD
TO PAY THEM AND EAT.

417
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:58,000
HE SENT A BUNCH OF SOLDIERS
INTO THE VILLAGE ONE DAY.

418
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:01,541
MY MOTHER AND FATHER
WERE BOTH KILLED.

419
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,875
WHEN I SCREAMED AT THEM TO STOP
THEY TRIED TO KILL ME.

420
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,833
BUT THEN ARUA
SHOVED IN BETWEEN US.

421
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,708
HE USED MAGIC.

422
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:15,125
I'VE KNOWN HIM MY WHOLE LIFE.
HE'D NEVER USED MAGIC BEFORE.

423
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,041
AND HIS EYES! HIS EYES!

424
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,833
THEY'RE CALLING HIM A MONSTER.

425
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,666
THE LORD AND THE SOLDIERS
TOOK HIM AWAY,

426
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,583
AND SAID THEY WERE GOING TO
DO ALL KINDS OF EXPERIMENTS.

427
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,833
PLEASE...
YOU'VE GOTTA SAVE ARUA!

428
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,583
- Ferris: RIGHT.
LET'S GET GOING.

429
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,625
- WHAT?

430
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,166
- WE CAN'T LEAVE AN ALPHA
STIGMA ON THE LOOSE.

431
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,708
I'VE SEEN WHAT KIND
OF HAVOC ONE CAN UNLEASH.

432
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,708
- BUT? I MEAN?

433
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,416
- FORGIVE ME, SHOULD WE WEIGH
THE PROS AND CONS FIRST?

434
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,791
- ( sighs )

435
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:52,708
- WHERE IS YOUR LITTLE FRIEND
BEING HELD CAPTIVE? SHOW US.

436
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,625
- UH, I THINK HE'S PROBABLY...

437
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,333
- VERY WELL THEN.
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED.

438
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,875
- ( theme song playing )

439
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,750
- Ryner: DEMON'S EYES. GREAT.
JUST WHAT I NEED TO HEAR.

440
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:44,416
YOU KNOW, IF PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO DRAG ME INTO THEIR CRAP

441
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,541
THEY OUGHT TO AT LEAST BE
A LITTLE MORE SENSITIVE!

442
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,791
I DIDN'T CHOOSE TO HAVE EYES
THAT FREAK EVERYBODY OUT

443
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,875
AND THERE'S NOTHING I CAN
DO ABOUT IT, OKAY?

444
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,708
UGH! THIS SUCKS!
