1
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,583
- ( growling )

2
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,083
- Ryner: LONG AGO,
THE FORCES OF DARKNESS

3
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,416
CALLED THIS WORLD
THEIR PLAYGROUND.

4
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,541
DEMONS, GHOULS,
EVIL SPIRITS, YOU NAME IT,

5
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,583
AT ONE TIME THEY
WERE SO NUMEROUS,

6
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,916
SO UNBELIEVABLY POWERFUL,

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,375
CIVILIZATION AS WE KNOW IT

8
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,875
ALMOST DIDN'T COME
INTO BEING AT ALL.

9
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,166
THEN THEY SHOWED UP.

10
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,041
ANCIENT WARRIORS STRONG ENOUGH

11
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,666
TO DRIVE THE DEMON HORDES OUT
AND CLEAR THE WAY FOR MANKIND.

12
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,000
HEROES WHOSE STAND AGAINST
THE FORCES OF DARKNESS

13
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,125
BECAME THE STUFF OF LEGEND.

14
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,541
IN THEORY, IF YOU COULD SIFT
THROUGH THE WRECKAGE

15
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,250
MANKIND'S MADE OF
THE PAST FEW CENTURIES,

16
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,083
IF YOU COULD DIG UP
FRAGMENTS OF THAT TURBULENT,

17
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,916
PIVOTAL AGE WHEN THE
GREAT HEROES OF OLD

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,791
HELD OUT AGAINST EVIL AND WON...

19
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,541
MAYBE WE COULD STAND
AGAINST THE FORCES OF DARKNESS

20
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,666
THAT CALL THE HUMAN
HEART THEIR PLAYGROUND.

21
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,041
PROVIDED THE STORIES ARE TRUE.

22
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:51,541
ACTIVATE!

23
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,375
BASIC ATTACK SPELL.
ATTRIBUTE, FLAME.

24
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,416
RANGE, TWENTY. POWER LEVEL, A.

25
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,541
ADJUSTED VALUE, ZERO-SEVEN-TWO.

26
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,916
CATALYST, NELPHA
PATTERN CREST FORM.

27
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:02,958
- ( gasps )

28
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,791
- All: FLARE BURST! AH!

29
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,625
- ( explosions )

30
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,916
- ( all groaning )

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,416
HEY! THAT'S OUR SPELL!

32
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,958
YES, BUT HE'S FROM ROLAND.
HOW COULD HE BE USING OUR MAGIC?

33
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,083
- ( gasps ) ALPHA STIGMA...

34
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,125
- ( indistinct chattering )

35
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,916
- Soldier: HE'S A
BLOODTHIRSTY MONSTER!

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,708
- STAND DOWN! ANY SPELL CAST,
HE'LL APPROPRIATE!

37
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,625
DO YOU TRAVEL HERE AS A SPY?

38
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,916
HAVE THE TERMS OF
OUR TREATY EXPIRED?

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,375
DOES ROLAND DEGRADE
ITSELF TO DECLARE WAR

40
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,083
ON THE KINGDOM OF NELPHA?

41
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,666
- NO, WE...
- THAT IS NOT OUR AIM.

42
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,625
- THANKS, FERRIS.

43
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,916
- AS A SPY, PRETTY BOY
WOULD ONLY BE GOOD

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,750
FOR FERRETING
OUT NEW CLOTHES.

45
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,916
- WHA...
SINCE WHEN DO I...

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,166
- ( chuckles )

47
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,583
THE TRUTH CAN BE
PAINFUL, I KNOW.

48
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,375
- WELL, IF I'M
JUST A PRETTY BOY

49
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,041
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT
THE GIRL DOGGING MY HEELS?

50
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,458
- FAR TOO MUCH.

51
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,416
IN YOUR DREAMS.

52
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,458
- All: SHE'S SO ADORABLE
AND WITTY!

53
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,250
- Both: DON'T LET HER
PRETTY FACE FOOL YOU!

54
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,958
- ( groaning )

55
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,875
- ENOUGH! NEUTRALIZE THEM!

56
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,583
- LOOK. BELIEVE ME,
WE'RE NOT SPIES.

57
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,875
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO FIND THE LOCATION

58
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,708
OF AN ANCIENT
RELIC FABLED TO...

59
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,333
- ( grunting )

60
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,750
- ( groans )

61
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,708
- ( gasps )

62
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,083
( whimpers )

63
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,666
- FALL BACK! FULL RETREAT!

64
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,958
- ( all screaming )

65
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,333
- LISTEN TO ME!
WE'RE NOT WAR MONGERERS!

66
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,083
THE WHOLE POINT OF
OUR MISSION IS TO...

67
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,333
( screams )

68
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,208
WHY WOULD YOU DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

69
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,583
I WAS JUST TRYING TO...

70
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,500
( gasps )

71
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,208
- THE FEWER PEOPLE WHO
KNOW OF OUR PURPOSE

72
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,916
HERE IN NELPHA,
THE BETTER.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
OR DOES THE MEANING OF

74
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:02,166
"COVERT OPERATIONS"
ELUDE YOU? HMM?

75
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,166
A SECRET IS WHAT WE
TELL ONE PERSON AT A TIME.

76
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,833
NOT AN ENTIRE REGIMENT.

77
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,500
- POINT MADE.
I'LL KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT.

78
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:16,708
- GOOD TACTIC. GET UP, RYNER.
WE'RE BURNING DAYLIGHT.

79
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,541
- ( sighs )

80
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,625
LIFE IS SO UNFAIR...

81
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,833
HOW'D I GET MYSELF
ROPED INTO THIS?

82
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,333
DON'T TEST ME.

83
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:30,333
DRAG YOUR FEET AND I'LL
LEAVE YOU TO THE WOLVES.

84
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,541
RIGHT BEHIND YOU!

85
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,583
EXCELLENT.

86
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,458
Ryner: SO, HERE'S WHAT I'M
SURE IS AN OBVIOUS QUESTION...

87
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,041
Ferris: OH?

88
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,416
- Ryner: IF WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
UNCOVER RELICS ONCE BRANDISHED

89
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,625
BY HEROES WHO ARE AT BEST LONG
DEAD, AND AT WORST FICTIONAL...

90
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:49,666
WHY ARE WE HERE?
STUFFING YOUR FACE WITH DANGO?

91
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,250
AH! UNBELIEVABLE...

92
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,875
WHY CAN'T DANGO EVERYWHERE
TASTE LIKE THIS...

93
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:58,708
SWEET, SUCCULENT AND TENDER...
JUST LIKE HOME!

94
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,250
- WELL GOOD FOR YOU...

95
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,708
( groans )

96
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,916
- I WON'T HAVE MY SOPHISTICATED
PALATE MADE FUN OF, BOY.

97
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,500
YOUR LITTLE THESIS ON MAGICAL
RELICS GOT US INTO THIS.

98
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,208
I'M JUST HERE TO KEEP
YOU OUT OF TROUBLE.

99
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,791
THE SOONER YOU GET TO WORK,

100
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,375
THE SOONER WE BOTH
GET TO GO HOME.

101
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,250
( moaning )

102
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,083
- ( sighs )

103
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,250
OKAY, SO...

104
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,625
WE'RE AT THE NELPHA-ROLAND
BORDER, RIGHT AROUND HERE.

105
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,875
THE FIRST RELIC SHOULD
BE TO THE SOUTHWEST.

106
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,125
UGH! MOUNTAINS.

107
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,833
JUST THE PICK-ME-UP WE
NEED AFTER A DAY'S HIKE.

108
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:39,375
STILL, ACCORDING TO
THE BOOK OF AMS...

109
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:44,625
AH, FOR A NAP.
THAT'S IT. GOOD NIGHT.

110
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,833
WAKE ME UP WHEN THE
LANDSCAPE CHANGES.

111
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:50,750
- NOT TO PRY... BUT ARE YOU
TRAVELERS FROM ROLAND?

112
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:54,416
- UH, MAYBE...
- OH, DON'T WORRY...

113
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,625
IT'S TRUE YOU'LL
FIND NO SHORTAGE

114
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,458
OF ROLAND'S FOES IN THIS AREA...

115
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,333
BUT I DON'T SHARE THEIR VIEW.

116
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,125
THANKS...
WE APPRECIATE THE GESTURE.

117
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:06,583
- TIME WAS, WAR AND STRIFE
RIDDLED OUR KINGDOM

118
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,291
BECAUSE OF ROLAND'S BLOODLUST...

119
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,583
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
THE TERRORS I'VE SEEN.

120
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,916
BUT YOUR LATEST KING
CHANGED ALL THAT.

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,875
AFTER THE REVOLUTION
THAT BROUGHT HIM TO POWER

122
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,291
TWO YEARS AGO,
OUR LOT IMPROVED.

123
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,875
- YEAH...

124
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:23,125
- THE ONE AND ONLY SION ASTAL.
AS BOLD AS HE IS COMPASSIONATE.

125
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,625
AND AS JUST AS HE IS HANDSOME!

126
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,583
EVEN A PUFFY OLD CRONE LIKE ME

127
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,791
CAN'T HELP BUT SQUEAL AT
SUCH IRRESISTIBLE CHARM.

128
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,083
- I HATE TO CONTRADICT, BUT...

129
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,333
ROLAND'S KING IS
ABSOLUTE EVIL. TRUST ME.

130
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,541
- EVIL?
- OH, YES...

131
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,000
THAT CHARM IS JUST A FACADE...

132
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,833
HIS HEART IS AS
BLACK AS MIDNIGHT.

133
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,708
HE HAS EXPLOITED
MY GREATEST WEAKNESS...

134
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,416
AND HE HOLDS ME
HOSTAGE WITH DANGO!

135
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,875
- SERIOUSLY...
HE MAY LOOK COMPASSIONATE...

136
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,333
BUT HE'D PUT YOUR SHOULDER
TO THE WHEEL FOR

137
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,875
THE TINIEST OFFENCE.

138
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,375
I WAS ONE OF HIS
MOST TRUSTED CONFIDANTS...

139
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,333
AND NOW HE WORKS ME TO THE BONE!

140
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,125
- MUCH AS I MAY BE DISINCLINED
TO, I MUST AGREE.

141
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,041
- NATURALLY... I BET HE'S
LAUGHING AT THE TWO OF US...

142
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,708
YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T
EVEN THINK HE REALLY

143
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:06,958
EXPECTS US TO SUCCEED.

144
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:10,750
- I SAY WE WILL.
- ME TOO... OUT OF SPITE.

145
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,208
- ( both chuckle )

146
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,958
- ( people cheering )

147
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,666
- ( crowd whistling )

148
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,875
- All: SION!

149
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,291
( exclaiming )

150
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,541
- SUCH ENTHUSIASM...

151
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,041
I'VE NEVER SEEN A
KING SO WELL RECEIVED.

152
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,333
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
IF HE HAS HIS WAY,

153
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,375
THE KINGDOM'S BEST
DAYS ARE STILL AHEAD OF US.

154
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,583
- OH, I BELIEVE IT.

155
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,458
ROLAND IS IN THE HANDS
OF A TRUE VISIONARY.

156
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,166
- IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK,
YOUR MAJESTY...

157
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,041
WE'VE BEEN ANXIOUS TO HEAR
ABOUT THE SITUATION IN CELYOA.

158
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,583
- IT IS A NIGHTMARE
THERE, CALNE.

159
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,375
THEIR LANDS ARE SO
RAVAGED BY FLOODWATERS

160
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,500
I FEAR EVEN THE TARIFF EXEMPTION
WILL DO THEM NO GOOD.

161
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,875
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

162
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,916
HAVE YOU ADJUSTED THE
ANNUAL BUDGET ACCORDINGLY?

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,875
- YES, SIR.
- HOW FARES THE CAPITAL?

164
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,833
- NO PROBLEMS TO
SPEAK OF, SIR...

165
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,250
THOUGH PREDICTABLY ENOUGH,
KLAUSBERR AND STEARIED

166
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,166
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF
YOUR RECENT TRAVELS...

167
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,875
THEY'VE BEEN SPREADING
THEIR SEDITIOUS MALICE

168
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,958
EVERYWHERE THEY
CAN FIND AN EAR.

169
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,458
- NOTHING UNUSUAL...

170
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,958
CLAUGH, WHAT OF THE HEALTH
OF OUR VASSAL STATES NOW?

171
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,625
- ( sighs )
RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE...

172
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,416
LOOK, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
YOUR HIGHNESS, 

173
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,333
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO
REST AFTER A LONG JOURNEY.

174
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,500
- I'LL AFFORD THAT
LUXURY WHEN ROLAND IS STABLE.

175
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,125
FAR TOO MUCH DEPENDS
ON MY CONTINUED VIGILANCE

176
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,708
FOR ME TO REST.

177
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,416
A MOMENT'S LAPSE WOULD
DELIVER THIS KINGDOM

178
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,583
RIGHT BACK INTO THE HANDS
OF THE GREEDY POWER BROKERS

179
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,583
WE PRIED IT FROM.

180
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,708
- YOU'RE RIGHT, I KNOW...

181
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,833
JUST THINK OF HOW DELIGHTED
THEY'LL ALL BE WHEN YOU

182
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,875
TOPPLE OVER FROM EXHAUSTION.

183
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,041
YOUR WORK ETHIC'S AS MUCH AN
INSPIRATION TO YOUR ENEMIES

184
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,583
AS IT IS TO THE PEOPLE.

185
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,541
- I AGREE. I THINK THAT'S AN
EFFECTIVE IF SOMEWHAT HOMESPUN

186
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,041
WAY TO FRAME THE ISSUE.

187
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,166
- I'M TRYING TO MAKE A POINT!
- YES. I'M AWARE OF THAT.

188
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,166
AND FOR THE RECORD I THINK
IT'S A POINT THAT MERITS

189
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,166
CLOSER CONSIDERATION.

190
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,166
SION, PLEASE...
WE ARE ALL HERE TO HELP YOU.

191
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,625
EVEN CLAUGH IS USEFUL,
AFTER A FASHION.

192
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,666
- DO YOU HOLD SOME GRUDGE
AGAINST THE WAY I OPERATE?

193
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,166
- ONLY YOU COULD THINK
MY WILLINGNESS TO TIDY UP

194
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,708
AFTER YOUR NUMEROUS
SOCIAL FAUX PAS

195
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,333
BORE THE MARKINGS
OF RESENTMENT.

196
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,541
DID I COMPLAIN
WHEN YOUR DALLIANCE

197
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,666
WITH A NOBLE'S DAUGHTER

198
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,833
FORCED ME TO PLAY
DAMAGE CONTROL? NO.

199
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,125
- OH, THAT REALLY HITS A BONE,

200
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,458
COMING FROM SOMEONE
WHOSE "SECRET" RENDEZVOUS

201
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,541
WITH LORD PEARL'S WIFE

202
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,958
EVERYONE IN THE
CASTLE KNOWS ABOUT!

203
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,875
- A REPORT FROM A
NELPHAN SQUADRON LEADER, SIR.

204
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,583
IT APPEARS OUR FRIENDS ARE
WANDERING THE BORDERLANDS

205
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,166
AT THE MOMENT.

206
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,333
- MY PRIVATE LIFE IS MY OWN!

207
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,416
- ARE THEY INDEED?
GOOD HUNTING TO THEM.

208
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,208
- Ferris: IS THIS THE PLACE?

209
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,083
- Ryner: ACCORDING TO
MY NOTES, YEAH...

210
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,916
OF COURSE THE THING
ABOUT THIS DOOR... HEY!

211
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,750
- LOOKS LIKE IT'S SEALED SHUT.
- I WAS GETTING TO THAT.

212
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,375
HMM. THIS IS A TRICKY ONE...

213
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,958
THE BINDING SPELL'S
BEEN FORTIFIED

214
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,375
BY DECOYS THAT HAVE TO
BE DISARMED IN JUST

215
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,750
THE PROPER SEQUENCE.

216
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:09,791
- DUCK.
- HUH?

217
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,958
- ( both grunting )

218
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,041
- ( whimpers )

219
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,125
YOU COULD GIVE ME THE COURTESY
OF A BETTER WARNING

220
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,083
BEFORE YOU
TRY TO SCALP ME!

221
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,708
- ( gasps )

222
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,833
- OKAY. THAT'S ONE LESS TRAP
WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT...

223
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,750
SO TIRED...

224
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,500
TOMB RAIDING IS DEFINITELY
NOT A PROFESSION

225
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,000
I'M INTERESTED
IN EXPLORING.

226
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,708
- WELL, IT DOESN'T INVOLVE
SPYING ON VOLUPTUOUS WOMEN

227
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,333
OR LURING INNOCENT YOUNG
GIRLS TO THEIR RUIN,

228
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,000
SO OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO
FEEL A BIT OUR OF YOUR DEPTH...

229
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,958
- Ryner: I'M NOT INTO
ANY OF THAT STUFF.

230
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,750
- Ferris: SAVE THE ACT
FOR YOUR PREY.

231
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,250
- ( screams )

232
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,458
- IS SOMETHING WRONG,
CAPTAIN MILK?

233
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,291
- ( groans )

234
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,333
- ( screaming )

235
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,833
- RYNER!

236
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,208
- ( gasps )

237
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,291
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

238
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,291
YOU ENJOYED THAT.

239
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,875
- LOOK OUT.
- HUH?

240
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,291
- GET OUT OF THE WAY!

241
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,791
- ( grunting )

242
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,333
- WHAT THE HELL! HUH?
- BEHIND YOU.

243
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,375
HOW MUCH WARNING DO YOU NEED?

244
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,708
- YOU ARE SO DEAD WHEN
I FIND A WAY OUT OF THIS...

245
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,625
- THIS DOESN'T BODE
WELL, DOES IT?

246
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,916
- Fiole: COUNT KLAUSBERR'S
CREST. BE STRONG, ESLINA.

247
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,166
( grunting )

248
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,041
- ( loud thud )

249
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,666
- ( glass shatters )

250
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,833
- PREPARE TO ANSWER
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE!

251
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,833
YOU'RE NOT...

252
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,541
( gasps )

253
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,708
- Claugh: OUT OF THE
CARRIAGE, RUNT!

254
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:21,416
SOMEONE SCRAPED THE BOTTOM OF
A VERY LARGE BARREL HIRING YOU.

255
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,916
- I'VE FAILED.

256
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,291
- WITH MY BROTHER AT MY SIDE,
HOW CAN I NOT BE JOYFUL?

257
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,250
- I DESERVE DEATH.
-HUH?

258
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,583
- JUST AS WELL. LIFE WITHOUT
MY SISTER IS NO LIFE.

259
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,708
- YOUR SISTER?
- ESLINA...

260
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,583
ONLY THIS MORNING...

261
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,500
COUNT KLAUSBERR SWOOPED
DOWN AND SNATCHED HER AWAY.

262
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:45,916
HE'S A NOBLE... ABOVE
ANSWERING TO THE LIKES OF ME...

263
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,833
AND WITHOUT ESLINA...

264
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,666
I CHOOSE TO LEAVE THIS
UGLY WORLD TO ITSELF.

265
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,500
- Sion: YOU WOULD LEAVE
YOUR SISTER TO NEGOTIATE

266
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,416
THE DARKNESS ALONE?

267
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,000
- SION ASTAL...
YOUR MAJESTY!

268
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,333
- I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO
BE PITCHED HEADLONG

269
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,333
INTO A HOSTILE WORLD
NOT OF YOUR OWN MAKING.

270
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,833
BUT EVIL FLOURISHES
LESS OF ITS OWN ANIMUS

271
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,750
THAN BY OUR CONVICTION THAT
THINGS CANNOT CHANGE,

272
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,916
SO BY ACCEPTING DEATH SHORT
OF SEEING JUSTICE DONE,

273
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,375
YOU LET CORRUPTION THRIVE.

274
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,375
- BUT, I...

275
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,708
- IF TRUE CHANGE IS TO COME,

276
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,708
PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND
I MUST BE ITS HARBINGERS.

277
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,125
- YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ANYONE.

278
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,750
PLAYING DEAD WILL
GET YOU NOWHERE.

279
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,416
- NOT COOL!
I COULD'VE BEEN...

280
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,875
- OH, ANGRY BUTTERFLIES...
- WHO ARE YOU?

281
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,250
- ( gasps ) I...

282
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,458
( screaming )

283
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,666
( sighs )

284
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,041
WELL THEN, SINCE THE JIG IS UP,
INTRODUCTIONS ARE IN ORDER.

285
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,125
MY NAME, SIR, IS MILK CALLAUD.

286
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,541
I AM THE DECORATED
LIEUTENANT CAPTAIN OF

287
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,541
ROLAND'S FIERCE AND ILLUSTRIOUS
TABOO BREAKER SQUADRON!

288
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,041
AND YOU ARE NONE OTHER
THAN OUR QUARRY!

289
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,875
A TABOO BREAKER!

290
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:06,041
THE INTEGRITY OF ROLAND'S
MAGIC SPELLS WILL BE SAVED!

291
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,833
( exclaims )

292
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,500
SHOOT! THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS...

293
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,000
HUH? HMM...

294
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,750
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
FERRIS. BUT I AM STARVING.

295
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,958
- MMM. YOU KNOW, DANGO WOULD
BE THE PERFECT ANTIDOTE

296
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,250
TO THE AIR IN THIS PLACE.

297
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,958
- NO YOU DON'T!

298
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,041
I'M PUTTING YOU UNDER
COMPULSORY RESTRAINT!

299
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,791
WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER...
IZUCHI!

300
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,000
( whimpering )

301
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,083
DON'T THINK I DON'T
UNDERSTAND!

302
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,250
THAT SADISTIC TROLLOP HAS
FIENDISHLY ENSNARED YOU

303
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,500
BY HER WILES! IT'S OBVIOUS!

304
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,833
- HUH?

305
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,875
- BELIEVE IN YOURSELF!
YOU CAN BREAK FREE OF HER!

306
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,375
- I'LL WHISK YOU AWAY TO SAFETY!
- I SEE.

307
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,708
THIS LITTLE FIREBRAND WOULDN'T
HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF YOUR

308
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,375
MANY VICTIMS, NOW WOULD SHE?

309
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,708
SOMEONE YOU TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF AND LEFT FOR DEAD?

310
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,750
- ENOUGH WITH THE PERV THING!
- HEY, WAIT!

311
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,500
I HAVEN'T BEEN TAKEN
ADVANTAGE OF.

312
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,750
- OH, SO SHE GAVE HERSELF
TO YOU WILLINGLY... MY MISTAKE.

313
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,875
- Both: NOTHING HAPPENED!

314
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,375
- THIS IS NOT SOME JOKE!

315
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,791
I DIDN'T WANT TO RESORT TO
THIS, BUT YOU FORCED MY HAND!

316
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,250
WHAT I SEEK IS...

317
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,875
( screaming )

318
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,916
LUKE, YOU...
OH, DEAR...

319
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
- YOU MUSTN'T WANDER
OFF ALONE LIKE THAT...

320
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,375
YOU HAD US ALL WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, CAPTAIN. OKAY?

321
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,833
- I APOLOGIZE.

322
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,625
- IT'S A GOOD THING WE
FOUND YOU WHEN WE DID.

323
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,875
- ( loud explosion )

324
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,708
- ( panting )

325
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,833
- WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

326
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,583
- THE ALPHA STIGMA'S HAVING
TROUBLE READING ITS STRUCTURE.

327
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,791
BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY A RELIC.

328
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,875
- Ferris: I GUESSED THAT.
HOW DO WE SUBDUE IT?

329
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,791
- Ryner: I DON'T KNOW!
I TOLD YOU I CAN'T MAKE IT OUT!

330
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,500
- GREAT. USEFUL...

331
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,708
- THERE IS NO CALL
TO BE SNARKY!

332
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,166
( screaming )

333
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,916
( panting )

334
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,708
- FERRIS!
- WHAT?

335
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,125
- RUN LIKE YOUR
LIFE DEPENDED ON IT!

336
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,708
- WHAT DOES IT LOOK
LIKE I'M DOING?

337
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,791
- FIOLE!
- ESLINA!

338
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,375
- ( crying ) I THOUGHT I'D
NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN!

339
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,000
- EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT NOW.
I'M WITH YOU.

340
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,875
- THEIR PARENTS WERE
KILLED IN THE LAST WAR.

341
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,541
THEY'VE BEEN LIVING
BY THEIR WITS EVER SINCE.

342
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,875
I CRINGE TO THINK HOW MANY
LIKE THEM THE KING CREATED...

343
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,166
- Sion: FORMER KING...

344
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,666
GRASPING AS HE WAS,

345
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,125
OUR LATE PATRIARCH
WAS ONLY A SCARECROW.

346
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,958
A FIGUREHEAD.

347
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,291
( sighs ) AS LONG AS THE
NOBLES FEEL ENTITLED

348
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,125
TO GLUT THEIR COFFERS AT
THE STATE'S EXPENSE...

349
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,333
SO SHALL EVERY KING BE.

350
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,375
- GOOD EVENING, YOUR MAJESTY...

351
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,500
I TRUST YOUR JOURNEY
WAS PLEASANT?

352
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,791
- QUITE SO, COUNT KLAUSBERR.

353
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,833
- HAVE YOU CHANCED
TO FIND THE GIFT I LEFT

354
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,541
FOR YOU IN YOUR CHAMBERS?

355
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:20,958
- I HAVE.

356
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,500
- NO MORE THAN A COMMON
WILDFLOWER, TO BE SURE,

357
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,375
BUT PLUCKED IN
THE BOON OF HEALTH...

358
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,250
I WELCOME YOUR HIGHNESS
TO PRUNE IT AS YOU DESIRE.

359
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,666
- AND INDEED I SHALL.

360
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,666
I AM MOST GRATEFUL FOR
THE GESTURE OF SOLIDARITY.

361
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,208
A NEWLY CHRISTENED SOVEREIGN
IS ABOVE ALL JUDGED

362
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,000
BY THE MANNER
OF COMPANY HE KEEPS.

363
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,750
- THEN SO MAY SHREWDLY FORGED
LOYALTIES SERVE YOU

364
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,625
AND THE KINGDOM, SIR.

365
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,916
- TO ROLAND'S PROSPERITY.

366
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,375
FILTH.

367
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,833
- ( panting )

368
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,291
- SO NOW WHAT?
- HUH?

369
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,416
- YOU THINK THIS RELIC IS
OFFICIALLY A LOST CAUSE?

370
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,625
- UM...

371
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,916
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A
SAFE ASSESSMENT, YEAH.

372
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,333
- FINE. THEN LET'S MOVE ON.

373
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:09,833
- RIGHT. WE CAN LEAVE THE
CLEANUP TO SLAVE-DRIVING KINGS.

374
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,833
WAIT. HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN WEARING THAT?

375
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,250
- OH. I PICKED IT UP
IN THE RUINS.

376
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,875
- YOU DON'T JUST WALK AWAY FROM
A TOMB WITH COSTUME JEWELRY.

377
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,500
- ( gasps )

378
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,458
- ( both screaming )

379
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,708
- ( groaning )

380
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,708
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

381
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,625
- SO THAT'S WHAT ONE OF
YOUR RELICS IS SUPPOSED TO DO.

382
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:58,375
- THIS IS PRETTY SERIOUS.
I MEAN LOOK AT THAT...

383
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,500
MOUNTAIN?

384
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,791
- WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.
MOVING ON.

385
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:09,500
- WISH I COULD BE THAT CALM...
I THINK.

386
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,500
( gasps )

387
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,833
SOMEONE'S STILL KICKING!

388
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,083
NO, IT'S ALRIGHT.
YOU GO ON AHEAD, FERRIS.

389
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:26,041
I'LL CATCH UP TO YOU
AS SOON AS I'M DONE HERE!

390
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,375
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

391
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,375
WE WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
VERY FAR IF DEEP DOWN

392
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,708
PEOPLE WEREN'T JUST AS LOATH
TO KILL AS THEY ARE TO DIE.

393
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:37,291
WAR FORCES THEM TO
CHOOSE ONE OVER THE OTHER.

394
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,500
HIGHBORN OR LOW, NO ONE
WANTS TO SOW MISERY.

395
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,666
NOT REALLY.

396
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,750
THEY JUST DON'T SEE AN OPTION.

397
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,750
WHEN OUR BACK'S
AGAINST THE WALL,

398
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,708
THE BEST OF US SEE THINGS
IN BLACK AND WHITE.

399
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,875
I'VE NEVER PUT MUCH STOCK
IN CHANGING THE WORLD.

400
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,500
BUT, I HAVE TO ADMIT...

401
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:57,125
THINGS CAN'T CONTINUE
THE WAY THEY ARE.

402
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:01,375
IF KILL OR DIE IS
THE ONLY CHOICE,

403
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,541
ITS TIME TO EXPAND OUR OPTIONS.

404
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:09,125
- POURING OVER IT AGAIN?
- I AM.

405
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,333
- YOU SEE THROUGH IT.

406
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,416
IT'S BUT A MONSTER'S BID
TO QUELL HIS TROUBLED SOUL

407
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,333
WITH SWEET,
EMPTY LITTLE WORDS...

408
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,916
JUST A FAIRY TALE.

409
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,500
- Sion: I'M GOING
TO DO IT, I WILL...

410
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,708
I'LL BE KING OF
THIS LAND SOMEDAY,

411
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,416
AND I'LL CHANGE
EVERYTHING...

412
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,708
I'LL CREATE THE PEACEFUL WORLD
YOU'VE ALWAYS DREAMT ABOUT.

413
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,333
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO,
IS JOIN ME.

414
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,875
- ( crying )

415
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,875
- ( Ryner speaking )

416
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,958
- ( theme song playing )

417
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,708
- Ryner: MAN, LIFE AS A
STUDENT SERIOUSLY SUCKS.

418
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:46,458
YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH
GO-GETTERS AND BUSY-BODIES

419
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:50,208
AND IDEALISTS WHEN THE ONLY
THING YOU WANT IS SOME SHUT-EYE.

420
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,333
FRIGGIN' WOE IS ME.
