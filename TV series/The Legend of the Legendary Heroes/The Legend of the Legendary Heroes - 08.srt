1
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:59,041
- SO, CARE TO TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS?

2
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,666
- DANGO. SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOUR VISION?

3
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,083
- BUT THIS MANY?

4
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:06,416
- I HAVEN'T PAID FOR THEM YET
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO.

5
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,791
- OH, IS THAT RIGHT?

6
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:10,041
- YES, AS RECOMPENSE FOR
YOUR FAILURE THE OTHER DAY.

7
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:12,375
- WE INFILTRATED THAT
FORTRESS FOR NO REASON...

8
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:15,833
AND THEN, LIKE AN IMBECILE,
YOU ABANDONED A HERO RELIC.

9
01:02:15,916 --> 01:02:19,166
SO. 'TIL OUR QUEST IS DONE,
YOU OWE ME DANGO EVERY DAY.

10
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:21,666
- WAIT! YOU ARE JUST AS MUCH
TO BLAME FOR THAT AS I AM!

11
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,041
WHAT COULD WE HAVE DONE?

12
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:24,708
HELL, I GUESS IF YOU COULD'VE
HAD THINGS YOUR WAY

13
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:26,166
YOU WOULD HAVE PREFERRED
TO LET THE DRAGON

14
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,916
GNAW ON OUR LIFELESS BODIES?

15
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,500
AND BESIDES.
YOU EAT TOO MUCH DANGO!

16
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:32,416
( gasps )

17
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,708
OKAY FINE, IT'S A DEAL.
I'LL BUY THEM, I'D BE GLAD TO.

18
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:38,333
- WELL, THAT'S SETTLED.
- COME AGAIN.

19
01:02:38,416 --> 01:02:40,208
- WHY IS THIS HAPPENING
TO ME, WHY...

20
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:41,583
I KNOW, THIS IS SION'S FAULT,

21
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:43,125
THIS JOURNEY WAS
HIS BRILLIANT IDEA!

22
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:45,791
THAT MAN CONTINUALLY HEAPS
PILES OF CRAP ON MY LIFE!

23
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:47,000
( groaning )

24
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:48,916
HE'S PROBABLY ENJOYING
A NICE, HOT BATH

25
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,083
WHILE SERVANTS FEED HIM
GRAPES AND WASH HIS FEET.

26
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:03,750
- YOUR MAJESTY,
THIS IS A REBELLION.

27
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:05,750
IT IS BEST MET WITH
AN IRON FIST,

28
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,166
NOT WITH COMPASSION.

29
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,583
- DO YOU FORGET YOUR PLACE?

30
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:10,875
WATCH YOUR TONE WHEN YOU
ADDRESS HIS MAJESTY!

31
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:12,791
- NO, WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
MUST BE HEARD.

32
01:03:12,875 --> 01:03:14,541
YOU HAVE BEEN FAR TOO SOFT.

33
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:16,625
YOU GRANTED LANDS TO
THE NOBLES OF ESTABUL

34
01:03:16,708 --> 01:03:18,333
IN EXCHANGE FOR
A PROMISE OF PEACE.

35
01:03:18,416 --> 01:03:20,458
YOU OFFERED
THE COMMONERS PROTECTION.

36
01:03:20,541 --> 01:03:22,291
STRENGTH, NOT WEAKNESS,
KEEPS ORDER!

37
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:24,000
- YOU HAVE SAID ENOUGH!

38
01:03:25,541 --> 01:03:28,458
- ( scoffs ) SO THE RING LEADER
SHOWS HIMSELF AT LAST.

39
01:03:28,541 --> 01:03:30,625
- FORGIVE HIM HIS PASSION,
YOUR MAJESTY.

40
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:32,833
- IT IS BORN OUT OF LOVE
FOR THIS KINGDOM.

41
01:03:32,916 --> 01:03:34,250
- YOU NEED NOT APOLOGIZE.

42
01:03:34,333 --> 01:03:35,458
- AS SUCH...

43
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:37,583
HOW DO YOU PLAN TO QUELL
THIS REBELLION?

44
01:03:37,666 --> 01:03:39,375
WHAT PATH WILL YOU TAKE?

45
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:41,041
IF I MAY OFFER YOU MY COUNSEL,

46
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:43,166
EXPEDIENCY IS ESSENTIAL,
MY LIEGE.

47
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:44,583
- AND WHAT WOULD
HE HAVE US DO?

48
01:03:44,666 --> 01:03:47,208
IT HASN'T BEEN TWO DAYS
SINCE WE FIRST RECEIVED NOTICE.

49
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:49,458
WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UPRISING,

50
01:03:49,541 --> 01:03:51,541
MUCH LESS THE STRENGTH
OF THEIR FORCES.

51
01:03:51,625 --> 01:03:53,208
- HE'S AN IRRITATING BASTARD.

52
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:56,125
- COUNTERMEASURES HAVE
ALREADY BEGUN.

53
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:58,958
OUR INTELLIGENCE DISPATCH
HAS RETURNED USEFUL RESULTS.

54
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:00,291
THE OLD KING'S ONLY DAUGHTER

55
01:04:00,375 --> 01:04:03,583
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
REVOLT. LADY NOA EHN.

56
01:04:03,666 --> 01:04:05,625
COLONEL MIRAN FROAUDE
WILL BRIEF YOU

57
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,541
ON THE INFORMATION
WE'VE GATHERED.

58
01:04:09,291 --> 01:04:10,500
- FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL,

59
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:13,208
THE ESTABUL FORCES ARE OVER
FIFTY THOUSAND STRONG.

60
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:14,291
- WHAT?

61
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:16,083
- FIFTY THOUSAND
MEN'S NOT A REVOLT...

62
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:17,166
IT'S A BLOODY WAR!

63
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,750
- BASED ON OUR
EARLIEST PROJECTIONS,

64
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:20,583
IT'S EXTREMELY LIKELY
THAT CIVILIANS FROM

65
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:23,000
NEIGHBORING TERRITORIES
WILL SUFFER CASUALTIES.

66
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:24,333
THIS CANNOT BE...

67
01:04:24,416 --> 01:04:26,708
WE WILL EVACUATE THEM
TO THE CASTLE IMMEDIATELY.

68
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:28,291
AND OF COURSE,
IN YOUR ABSENCE,

69
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:29,666
WE WILL PROTECT
YOUR TERRITORIES.

70
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:31,250
- NO, THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE!

71
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:32,875
- YOU'D HAVE US
ABANDON OUR LANDS

72
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:34,791
WHILE THE MILITARY
TRAMPLES OVER THEM?

73
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:37,041
SURELY THE COLONEL
DOESN'T THINK US FOOLS?

74
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:39,375
- DOES THIS RELUCTANCE
DERIVE FROM FEAR OF

75
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:40,375
WHAT WE MIGHT DISCOVER?

76
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:42,375
- NO...
IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT.

77
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:45,125
- IF YOU PREFER TO STAY BEHIND,
YOU ARE WELCOME TO DO SO.

78
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:48,041
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER,
ESTABUL'S FORCES ARE COMING.

79
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:49,708
FIFTY-THOUSAND STRONG
AND COUNTING.

80
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:51,375
- ( men chattering )

81
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:55,000
- MY LORD, I WILL LEAD THE ARMY,
IF IT PLEASES YOUR MAJESTY.

82
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:56,875
WE'LL FORTIFY THE
SURROUNDING TERRITORIES

83
01:04:56,958 --> 01:04:58,708
AND SUPPRESS ESTABUL'S FORCES.

84
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:00,041
- NO...

85
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:02,750
REAR ADMIRAL CLAUGH KLOM
WILL COMMAND OUR LEGIONS.

86
01:05:04,791 --> 01:05:06,666
- I'M HONORED, YOUR MAJESTY.

87
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,083
- COLONEL, YOU'LL BE
IN CHARGE OF GATHERING

88
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:09,625
AND DISSEMINATING INFORMATION.

89
01:05:09,708 --> 01:05:11,375
GIVE THE ADMIRAL
WHATEVER HE NEEDS.

90
01:05:11,458 --> 01:05:13,291
- WITH RESPECT,
I MUST OBJECT, SIRE!

91
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:16,291
- IT'S NOT UP FOR DISCUSSION,
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

92
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:17,500
- YES.

93
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:24,041
- Miran: YOUR MAJESTY.
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT EXACTLY?

94
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:26,416
- YOU'RE BEHIND THE REVOLT
IN ESTABUL, AREN'T YOU?

95
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,916
- ( stammering )

96
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,625
- YOU PLANTED THE SEED OF
REBELLION AND UNITED THE PEOPLE

97
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:33,916
UNDER A BANNER OF HATRED
AS A PRETEXT FOR QUASHING THEM.

98
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,958
YET THE WAR IS ONLY A MASK
SHROUDING YOUR INTENT TO EXPOSE

99
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:40,250
THE NOBLES WHO AIM
TO PUSH ME FROM THE THRONE.

100
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:42,583
- AND WHAT IF THAT WERE TRUE,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO, SIRE?

101
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:46,250
- I'D DO NOTHING. YOU JUST
FOCUS ON THE TASK AT HAND.

102
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:47,625
NOTHING MORE.

103
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:58,125
- I WISH MY FATHER WOULD
CHOOSE TO LEAVE ROLAND.

104
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:01,208
- THE KING MADE HIS
CHOICE LONG AGO.

105
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,708
YOU MUST NOT FRET FOR HIM.

106
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:05,083
YOUR FATHER READILY SOLD
HIS KINGDOM IN EXCHANGE FOR

107
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:07,833
ROLAND'S BLOOD MONEY
AND THE PROMISE OF PROTECTION.

108
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:09,583
HE HAS CHOSEN HIS PATH.

109
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:11,833
- YES, I KNOW THAT. BUT STILL...

110
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:14,208
IF HE WERE TO RETURN HOME
AND LEAD THE REBELLION.

111
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:16,458
THE SPIRITS OF THE PEOPLE
WOULD BE LIFTED.

112
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:18,041
- THE PEOPLE LOVE YOU.

113
01:06:18,125 --> 01:06:20,625
YOU HAVE THE RESPECT AND
SUPPORT OF ALL OF THE NOBLES.

114
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:24,125
WHERE YOU LEAD, WE FOLLOW.
YOU'RE OUR KING NOW.

115
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:26,666
- ( sighing ) MY HEART
FEARS FOR THE PEOPLE.

116
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:29,541
- AND WHY IS THAT?

117
01:06:29,625 --> 01:06:31,666
- WHAT IF THE REBELLION
FAILS AND WE FALTER

118
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:32,916
ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE?

119
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,083
ROLAND HAS LONG BEEN
OUR FRIEND AND ALLY.

120
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:36,791
WHY SHOULD THAT CHANGE NOW?

121
01:06:36,875 --> 01:06:38,916
I FEAR OUR ACTIONS
ARE IMPRUDENT.

122
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,583
- ROLAND CARES NOTHING FOR US!

123
01:06:40,666 --> 01:06:42,250
WE ARE SWORN TO PROTECT
THIS KINGDOM!

124
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:45,083
- MY ONLY CONCERN IS FOR
THE PEOPLE, NOT THE KINGDOM.

125
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:47,916
AND DEEP DOWN, MY HEART TELLS ME
THAT THIS IS NOT THEIR WILL.

126
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,875
WHAT CAN THIS BLOODSHED BRING
BUT DEATH AND MISERY?

127
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:54,000
THE PEOPLE OF THIS LAND
DESERVE A LIFE OF PEACE

128
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:55,583
AND PROSPERITY.

129
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:59,125
AFTER ALL, AREN'T YOU THE PERSON
WHO TAUGHT ME THAT, SALAWELL?

130
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:01,666
- OUR MEN ARE IMBUED WITH
THAT SAME SPIRIT.

131
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:04,000
THEY'RE PREPARED TO FIGHT
FOR THOSE SAME PRINCIPLES.

132
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:06,916
BUT READINESS IS ALL AND
THE TIME TO STRIKE IS UPON US.

133
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,500
THE ROLAND NOBLES WOULD
HAVE OUR PEOPLE CRAWLING

134
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:10,791
ON ALL FOURS
LIKE BEASTS.

135
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:13,958
FULFILL YOUR DUTY
AND RIDE OUT TO MEET THEM!

136
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:18,291
- IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE, THEN
FOR THE PEOPLE'S SAKE, I MUST.

137
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:20,166
- I'D FOLLOW YOU ANYWHERE,
MY LADY,

138
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,166
EVEN STRAIGHT
INTO THE ARMS OF DEATH.

139
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:25,916
- Young Noa: MY DREAM IS
TO BUILD A KINGDOM!

140
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
A PLACE WHERE PEACE
ALWAYS REIGNS.

141
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:30,291
WHERE EVERYONE CAN BE HAPPY!

142
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:32,583
- WHAT DO YOU THINK,
CAN I DO IT, SALAWELL?

143
01:07:32,666 --> 01:07:34,333
- OF COURSE YOU CAN!

144
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:35,750
- ( chuckling )

145
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:43,166
- ( wind blowing )

146
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:48,666
- ( men murmuring )

147
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:52,000
- TOO LONG HAVE OUR PEOPLE LIVED
IN THE GRASP OF ROLAND'S FIST!

148
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:55,083
WE'LL MEET THEM ON THE FIELD OF
BATTLE AND BE FREE ONCE AGAIN!

149
01:07:55,166 --> 01:07:57,166
- ( men cheering )

150
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:00,666
- Man: I BRING NEWS
FROM THE FRONT!

151
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:03,083
THE BATTLE IS
UNDERWAY, SIRE!

152
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:12,750
- ( man grunting )

153
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:14,625
- ( men shouting )

154
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:23,125
- SHUSS, WHAT ARE
THEIR NUMBERS?

155
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:25,291
- LOOKS LIKE THE FIRST WAVE'S
EIGHT TO NINE THOUSAND.

156
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:27,250
- JUST AS COLONEL
FROAUDE CLAIMED.

157
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:29,333
- I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL.
- SIR?

158
01:08:29,416 --> 01:08:30,916
- FORGET ABOUT IT.

159
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,541
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THIS
FIELD WITH MINIMAL CASUALTIES.

160
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:36,750
RIDE! ALL FORCES, ATTACK!

161
01:08:36,833 --> 01:08:39,250
- ( soldiers shouting )

162
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:40,791
- THE DOGS OF ROLAND!

163
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:42,583
- WHAT ROCK DID THEY
CRAWL OUT FROM UNDER?

164
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:43,750
- WE CAN'T USE SPELLS.

165
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:45,916
WE'D RUN THE RISK OF
KILLING OUR OWN MEN!

166
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,875
- CLEAVE THROUGH THEM,
SOLDIERS! WHERE IS HE?

167
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,041
THEIR COMMANDER!

168
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,583
- ( man screaming in pain )

169
01:08:58,416 --> 01:09:00,083
- ( grunting )

170
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:01,583
- THERE HE IS!

171
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:04,750
- NOW, DIE!
- IT'S HIM!

172
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:14,000
- DEATH IS REBELLION'S ONLY
REWARD! LAY DOWN YOUR WEAPONS!

173
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,791
OR MEET THE SAME FATE
AS YOUR COMMANDER!

174
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:20,375
- THE RING AROUND HIS ARM!
- THAT'S CRIMSON CLAUGH!

175
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:23,750
- IT'S CLAUGH!
THE LEGENDARY CAPTAIN OF ROLAND!

176
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:26,333
- SO MUCH DEATH AND
DESTRUCTION, AND TO WHAT END?

177
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:32,833
- HMM.

178
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,333
- WE'VE BEEN DEFEATED AGAIN?

179
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:40,125
- IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY'RE
AWARE OF OUR STRATEGY

180
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:41,708
BEFORE WE CAN IMPLEMENT IT!

181
01:09:41,791 --> 01:09:42,833
- I TOLD YOU NOT TO
STRIKE AGAIN.

182
01:09:42,916 --> 01:09:44,333
I KNEW WE
WERE BEING HASTY!

183
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:46,208
- WE HAD NO CHOICE!

184
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:49,000
- CRIMSON CLAUGH? THAT'S AN
UNFITTING NAME FOR A MAN

185
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:51,375
SO CONCERNED WITH
OUR TROOPS' WELL BEING.

186
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:53,166
- BUT. MY LADY...

187
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:54,500
- IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE...

188
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:56,500
ADMIRAL KLOM HAS GONE
TO GREAT LENGTHS

189
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:59,125
TO SPARE OUR TROOPS AND
FORCE THEM TO SURRENDER.

190
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:00,291
- PERHAPS.

191
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:02,333
- THESE ARE NOT THE
ACTIONS OF AN ENEMY.

192
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:05,500
THE KING OF ROLAND IS CLEARLY
OFFERING US HIS GRACE.

193
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:06,916
AND HIS GOODWILL.

194
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,458
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
MY LADY,

195
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:10,458
DON'T LET NAIVETE
GET THE BEST OF YOU.

196
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:11,916
- YES, HE'S RIGHT.

197
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,916
ONCE ESTABUL FALLS AND THE
NOBLES HAVE BEEN SUPPLANTED,

198
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,583
THEY WILL WREAK HAVOC ON
OUR PEOPLE AND OUR LANDS.

199
01:10:16,666 --> 01:10:21,125
- OUR CAUSE IS NOT LOST YET.
YOU MUST NOT FALTER, PRINCESS.

200
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:23,166
- ADMIRAL KLOM'S FORCES
HAVE SURROUNDED

201
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,208
THE REBEL ARMY'S
MAIN STRONGHOLD.

202
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:52,416
- ( grunting )

203
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:55,166
- WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

204
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,041
- "WITHDRAW THE ENTIRE
ROLAND ARMY AND RELEASE

205
01:10:57,125 --> 01:10:58,541
ALL PRISONERS IMMEDIATELY.

206
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:01,375
"IF YOU DO NOT CONCEDE
TO ALL DEMANDS HEREIN.

207
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:04,791
"THE CITIZENS OF ESTABUL WILL
BE BEHEADED ON THE SPOT."

208
01:11:04,875 --> 01:11:08,208
THOSE VERY WORDS WERE DELIVERED
BY MISSIVE TO THE ENEMY CAMP.

209
01:11:08,291 --> 01:11:10,375
- THE HERO KING OF
ROLAND WON'T STAND BY

210
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:12,750
AND LET COMMON PEOPLE
SUFFER FOR HIS SINS.

211
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:15,291
- BUT SALAWELL...
THAT'S NOT WHAT...

212
01:11:15,375 --> 01:11:18,875
- YES, I KNOW. I'M SORRY. BUT
IT SIMPLY COULDN'T BE HELPED.

213
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:21,666
UNDERSTAND, I'M TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU, MY LADY.

214
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:24,875
- YOU CLAIM IT'S FOR MY SAKE
YOU HOLD OUR PEOPLE HOSTAGE?

215
01:11:24,958 --> 01:11:26,583
- THIS IS THE WILL
OF THE PEOPLE.

216
01:11:26,666 --> 01:11:29,208
IF ESTABUL FALLS,
THEN WHAT WILL BECOME OF THEM?

217
01:11:29,291 --> 01:11:30,958
WOULD YOU PREFER
WE DISGRACE OUR PEOPLE

218
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:33,125
BY BOWING DOWN AND RAISING
THE BANNER OF TRUCE?

219
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:35,208
- DO YOU THINK THIS
BRINGS THEM HONOR?

220
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,791
THAT HOLDING THEM HOSTAGE
BARES NO DISGRACE?

221
01:11:39,166 --> 01:11:40,875
SURELY THERE MUST
BE ANOTHER WAY.

222
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:42,958
- NO, THERE ISN'T.

223
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:50,208
- I SEE. YOU'VE PROPPED
ME UP ON A THRONE

224
01:11:50,291 --> 01:11:51,541
SO I COULD BE YOUR PUPPET.

225
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:54,291
IN THE END, I CAN'T
SAVE ANYBODY, CAN I?

226
01:11:54,375 --> 01:11:55,416
- ( door opens )

227
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:59,583
- MY LADY!
ROLAND'S ATTACKING US!

228
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:01,125
- THE ROLAND LEGIONS!

229
01:12:01,208 --> 01:12:02,666
THEY'RE ATTACKING
THE ESTABUL FORTRESS, SIR!

230
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:03,791
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

231
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:05,416
- ( explosion )

232
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:09,750
- OUR SQUADRONS
ARE ASSEMBLED ADMIRAL,

233
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:11,791
AND THEY'RE ADVANCING
TOWARDS THE ENEMY!

234
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:13,958
- WAIT. WHAT SQUADRONS EXACTLY?

235
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:16,541
- MAYBE HIS MAJESTY DEPLOYED
THE REINFORCEMENTS.

236
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:19,291
- THE KING PUT THE ROLAND
FORCES UNDER MY COMMAND, SHUSS.

237
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:21,375
- NO WAY HE'D DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT!

238
01:12:21,458 --> 01:12:22,250
- OF COURSE, SIR.

239
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:24,666
- NO...
IT'S FROUADE.

240
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,125
- ( loud explosion )

241
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:28,833
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
- THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

242
01:12:28,916 --> 01:12:31,125
THE ADMIRAL WOULDN'T DISREGARD
OUR WARNINGS AND ATTACK!

243
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:32,541
- IF THE FORTRESS IS OVERRUN

244
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:34,125
WE'LL BE BRANDED
AS WAR CRIMINALS.

245
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:36,583
- FOR GOD'S SAKE,
WE THREATENED OUR OWN PEOPLE!

246
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:39,291
- NO! THIS FIGHT IS
FAR FROM OVER!

247
01:12:40,541 --> 01:12:42,291
LET'S EXECUTE THE HOSTAGES!

248
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:43,583
- ( all gasping )

249
01:12:43,666 --> 01:12:46,208
- YES, I SEE. ROLAND IS
CALLING US ON OUR BLUFF.

250
01:12:46,291 --> 01:12:47,291
IF WE KILL A HOSTAGE,

251
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:48,666
THEY'LL KNOW HOW
SERIOUS WE ARE!

252
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:51,666
- GENTLEMEN! STOP THIS NONSENSE.
- MY LADY?

253
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:54,000
- THIS ORDEAL'S GONE
ON LONG ENOUGH.

254
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:55,541
I WON'T STAND FOR IT.

255
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:57,708
I COMMAND YOU,
RELEASE THE HOSTAGES.

256
01:12:57,791 --> 01:12:59,458
- BUT, PRINCESS...

257
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:02,000
- IF A LIFE MUST BE LOST
THEN LET ME BE THE ONE

258
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:03,833
TO MAKE THE SACRIFICE.

259
01:13:03,916 --> 01:13:07,291
- PRINCESS. NO, I WON'T ALLOW
YOU TO PERISH ON YOUR OWN.

260
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:08,416
PLEASE, MY LADY.

261
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,458
YOU MUST ALLOW ME
TO ACCOMPANY YOU.

262
01:13:10,541 --> 01:13:12,500
- YES.
- WE ARE WITH YOU AS WELL.

263
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:15,083
- YOUR WORDS ALONE ARE ENOUGH
TO GIVE ME COURAGE.

264
01:13:15,166 --> 01:13:16,833
- Salawell: YOUR
HIGHNESS, PLEASE.

265
01:13:16,916 --> 01:13:19,041
- BUT, I WANT EVERY LAST
ONE OF YOU TO LIVE...

266
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:21,416
IN MY HONOR, SEEK TO PROVIDE
THE PEOPLE OF THIS LAND

267
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:24,041
WITH A HAPPY LIFE AND
A LASTING PEACE.

268
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:26,083
DO THIS FOR ME. PLEASE.

269
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:27,458
- Miran: NOW I HAVE A DILEMMA.

270
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:29,500
- ( gasping )

271
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:31,666
- I HAVE TO CONFESS I DO FIND
YOUR SENTIMENTS

272
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,041
TO BE QUITE MOVING.
HOWEVER...

273
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:36,666
I'M AFRAID THE LIFE OF
THE CROWNED PRINCESS ALONE

274
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:39,083
WON'T SUFFICE TO ATONE FOR
THE CRIMES YOU HAVE COMMITTED

275
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:40,958
AGAINST THE BLESSED
KING OF ROLAND...

276
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:43,875
SO... TO ACCOMPANY
THE TERRIBLE TRAGEDY

277
01:13:43,958 --> 01:13:46,125
OF THE KINGDOM OF
ESTABUL FALLING...

278
01:13:46,208 --> 01:13:47,791
I CAN THINK OF
NO BETTER ADORNMENT

279
01:13:47,875 --> 01:13:48,875
THAN ANOTHER TRAGEDY.

280
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,375
- WHO ARE YOU?

281
01:13:50,458 --> 01:13:52,541
- MY NAME IS MIRAN FROAUDE,
PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD OF ME.

282
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:54,458
I AM A COLONEL IN
THE ROLAND ARMY.

283
01:13:54,541 --> 01:13:55,833
- HOW'D YOU GET HERE?

284
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:58,250
- WHAT, DID YOU KILL
EVERY SOLDIER OUTSIDE?

285
01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:59,583
- Miran: CERTAINLY NOT.

286
01:13:59,666 --> 01:14:00,958
THOUGH ONE WOULD THINK
YOU'D HAVE MORE

287
01:14:01,041 --> 01:14:02,666
CONFIDENCE IN YOUR MILITARY.

288
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,416
OF COURSE, EVEN IF
THE FORTRESS DID FALL,

289
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,708
THE ROLAND SOLDIERS
COULDN'T COME INSIDE.

290
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:07,541
AFTER ALL...

291
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:09,583
- ( gasps )

292
01:14:09,666 --> 01:14:11,041
- THIS PLACE HAS AN
IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY

293
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:12,541
IN THE FINALE
OF THIS TRAGEDY...

294
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:14,833
DARKNESS. ATTACK!

295
01:14:17,416 --> 01:14:18,625
- ( man screaming )

296
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:21,125
- ( grunting )

297
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:22,500
- ( screaming )

298
01:14:25,916 --> 01:14:28,000
- THE PRINCESS!
- HURRY. LET'S GO!

299
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:29,708
- WE CAN'T LEAVE THEM!

300
01:14:32,041 --> 01:14:33,208
- ( panting )

301
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:39,208
- Salawell: COME ON!

302
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:45,875
- EVERYONE'S DEAD.

303
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:49,791
IT'S GONE. THEY'RE GONE.

304
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:52,375
THE KINGDOM AND
ALL OF THE PEOPLE TOO.

305
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:54,375
- YOU'RE WRONG.
NOT EVERYTHING IS GONE.

306
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:57,458
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT,
WHAT HOPE DO WE HAVE NOW?

307
01:14:58,333 --> 01:14:59,541
- YOU'RE ALIVE, AREN'T YOU?

308
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:04,416
IN A FINAL ACT OF REBELLION,
LET'S ATTACK THEM.

309
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,875
WE'LL START BY EXECUTING
THE HOSTAGES.

310
01:15:06,958 --> 01:15:08,083
- BUT SALAWELL...

311
01:15:08,166 --> 01:15:09,458
- AND YOU SHOULD BE
THE ONE TO LEAD THEM

312
01:15:09,541 --> 01:15:10,833
TO VICTORY, YOUR HIGHNESS.

313
01:15:10,916 --> 01:15:12,166
YOU SHOULD COMMAND THEM!

314
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:14,791
- NO, BUT... WE CAN'T.

315
01:15:14,875 --> 01:15:17,125
- AND THEN SALAWELL...
THE ESTABUL NOBLE...

316
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:19,000
THE SAVIOR OF
THE KINGDOM OF ROLAND,

317
01:15:19,083 --> 01:15:21,250
WILL KILL THE
RECALCITRANT PRINCESS

318
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:22,958
AND PUT AN END
TO THE BLOODSHED.

319
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:24,583
FOR WHICH DEED,
THE YOUNG HERO KING

320
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:26,208
WILL SHOWER HIM IN ACCOLADES.

321
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:28,625
- THIS WAS YOUR PLAN
FROM THE BEGINNING?

322
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:30,958
TO USE THE HOSTAGES
TO PROP YOURSELF UP?

323
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:35,916
TO SACRIFICE ME?
I TRUSTED YOU.

324
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,333
- INITIALLY, I PLANNED TO TAKE
CONTROL OF THE KINGDOM

325
01:15:38,416 --> 01:15:40,250
AND HAVE YOU AS MY QUEEN.

326
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:42,333
- MY ONLY DESIRE WAS
TO CREATE A KINGDOM

327
01:15:42,416 --> 01:15:44,958
WHERE PEOPLE COULD LIVE IN
PEACE AND PROSPERITY.

328
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,625
BUT NOW...

329
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:51,208
- THE WORLD CARES NOTHING
FOR YOUR CHILDISH IDEALS, NOA.

330
01:15:51,291 --> 01:15:54,083
- EVEN STILL...
EVEN STILL!

331
01:15:55,875 --> 01:15:59,250
- YOU ARE ADORABLE! TOO BAD
THIS IS THE END FOR YOU!

332
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:03,458
- ( Salawell laughing )

333
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:05,791
- ( Noa gasping )

334
01:16:09,083 --> 01:16:10,791
- ( Salawell screams )

335
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:18,416
- SORRY TO ALARM YOU.

336
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:22,041
ROLAND IS NOT IN NEED OF
A HERO SO DESPERATELY

337
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:24,666
THAT WE'D RESORT TO
SUCH A DISGRACEFUL MAN.

338
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:26,208
- WHO'S BEHIND THIS?

339
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:28,916
IS THIS THE WILL OF SION ASTAL,
THE HERO KING OF ROLAND

340
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,416
OR IS IT YOUR DOING?

341
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,083
- NO, MY KING HAS NO TASTE
FOR SUCH THINGS.

342
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:35,541
I'M AFRAID I MUST TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS RUSE.

343
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:38,541
- HOLD ON.

344
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:40,166
THEN YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S BEEN
CONSPIRING WITH SALAWELL

345
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:41,500
TO LEAD US INTO THIS REVOLT.

346
01:16:41,583 --> 01:16:42,833
- YES, IT WAS ME.

347
01:16:42,916 --> 01:16:44,958
OF COURSE THE KING SAW
THROUGH MY PLAN,

348
01:16:45,041 --> 01:16:48,500
AND APPOINTED ADMIRAL KLOM TO
SUPPRESS THE REVOLT IN MY PLACE.

349
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:50,708
THAT'S THE KIND OF
MAN MY KING IS.

350
01:16:50,791 --> 01:16:54,083
HOWEVER...
IT'S JUST AS SALAWELL SAID...

351
01:16:54,166 --> 01:16:57,875
THIS CRUEL WORLD CARES NOTHING
FOR CHILDISH IDEALS.

352
01:16:57,958 --> 01:17:00,416
SADLY, AFTER LADY NOA
KILLS THE HOSTAGES,

353
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,208
SHE TAKES HER OWN LIFE...

354
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:04,208
THAT'S HOW THIS TRAGEDY ENDS.

355
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:06,791
- YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE
KING ASTAL WOULD FORGIVE THAT?

356
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:09,333
- NO, BUT AS I'M NOT PLANNING
ON HIS FINDING OUT...

357
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:11,666
THERE WILL BE NO INDISCRETION
FOR HIM TO FORGIVE...

358
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:13,541
BESIDES, YOU'RE THE
ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS.

359
01:17:15,541 --> 01:17:17,375
- ( grunts )

360
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:23,375
EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT.
JUST COME WITH ME!

361
01:17:24,791 --> 01:17:26,791
IT WAS ALWAYS YOU
BEHIND THIS REVOLT.

362
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:29,291
- CONGRATULATIONS KLOM,
YOU'VE BESTED ME...

363
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:31,500
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU
TO BE HERE WITH SUCH SPEED.

364
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:34,750
- YOU HAVE BETRAYED YOUR KING!
- ADMIRAL KLOM?

365
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:37,208
WAIT, THAT MEANS THAT THIS MAN
IS THE CRIMSON CLAUGH?

366
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:39,416
- FOR THE SINS
YOU'VE COMMITTED!

367
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,541
- LET ME GUESS. YOU'RE GOING
TO PUT AN END TO ME.

368
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:43,625
- YOU'VE PREYED ON THE
COMPASSION OF OUR KING

369
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:44,875
LONG ENOUGH!

370
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:46,625
- HEAVY IS THE HEAD
THAT WEARS THE CROWN.

371
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:48,166
DO YOU NOT SEE THAT?

372
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:51,041
DO YOU NOT SEE THE TERRIBLE
BURDEN THAT DAILY GNARLS HIM?

373
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:54,625
- THE ONLY THING I SEE IS A DEAD
MAN STANDING IN FRONT OF ME!

374
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:57,125
- FOR THE SAKE OF THE WEARY PATH
THE KING MUST TREAD...

375
01:17:57,208 --> 01:18:00,208
I WILL EXECUTE LADY NOA EHN
AND THE HOSTAGES.

376
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:03,375
IF YOU CONTINUE TO STAND
IN MY WAY, ADMIRAL...

377
01:18:03,458 --> 01:18:05,583
- YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE
TO DO, COLONEL.

378
01:18:05,666 --> 01:18:07,416
- I HOPED YOU WOULD SAY THAT.

379
01:18:10,333 --> 01:18:11,375
- NO.

380
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:15,500
HE'LL KILL HIM.

381
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:21,000
FOR THE SAKE OF THE
INNOCENT PEOPLE OF ESTABUL,

382
01:18:21,083 --> 01:18:23,000
WE CANNOT AFFORD
TO LOSE THIS MAN.

383
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:26,083
- DARKNESS!
- WE MUSTN'T!

384
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:27,166
- ( Claugh screams )

385
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:29,625
- FROAUDE!

386
01:18:29,708 --> 01:18:31,458
COLONEL FROAUDE!

387
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:33,375
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SLAUGHTER THE HOSTAGES

388
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:36,916
IN ORDER TO CONQUER ESTABUL.
THERE'S ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE

389
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,583
I WILL PERSUADE THEM.

390
01:18:38,666 --> 01:18:39,791
ALL OF OUR PEOPLE...

391
01:18:39,875 --> 01:18:42,541
I CAN CONVINCE THEM
TO FOLLOW ROLAND!

392
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:44,500
- MY LADY...
WHAT ARE YOU...

393
01:18:44,583 --> 01:18:46,958
- IT WILL BE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE
THAN KILLING THE HOSTAGES

394
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:48,458
AND DAMNING ESTABUL.

395
01:18:48,541 --> 01:18:51,041
NO MORE BLOOD NEED BE SPILLED
FOR YOU TO BE THE VICTOR.

396
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:52,625
- INDEED...

397
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:56,500
IT'S TRUE, YOU ARE WELL LOVED BY
THE COMMON PEOPLE OF THIS LAND.

398
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:58,083
THOUGH THERE WILL
BE MANY A DETRACTOR

399
01:18:58,166 --> 01:18:59,416
WHO CALLS YOU A TRAITOR

400
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,500
FOR SELLING OUT HER PEOPLE
TO THE ROLAND NOBILITY.

401
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:02,958
- I CARE NOT...

402
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:04,708
AND WHEN EVERYTHING
IS ALL SAID AND DONE,

403
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:07,875
YOU MAY ASSASSINATE ME
IF YOU SEE IT FIT.

404
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:09,375
JUST PROMISE...

405
01:19:09,458 --> 01:19:11,541
PROMISE YOU'LL GIVE
MY PEOPLE PEACE.

406
01:19:11,916 --> 01:19:14,125
- WE HAVE A DEAL.

407
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:16,125
CONSIDER THE REBELLION ENDED.

408
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:19,166
PLEASE CALL OFF YOUR SOLDIERS,
ADMIRAL. THEY ARE DONE HERE.

409
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:20,666
- DAMN YOU!

410
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:26,291
- MY LADY?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

411
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:29,666
- I AM NOW. WITH YOU AND
THE KING OF ROLAND ON MY SIDE.

412
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:36,750
I'M SORRY TO ASK.

413
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:39,041
BUT I'M AFRAID THAT I CAN'T
STAND ON MY OWN JUST YET.

414
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:41,166
WOULD YOU BE SO KIND AS TO
LEND ME YOUR HAND?

415
01:19:42,083 --> 01:19:43,125
- OF COURSE.

416
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:48,250
- THANK YOU.

417
01:19:52,208 --> 01:19:55,750
WITH MEN LIKE YOU...
I KNOW THE PEOPLE WILL BE FINE.

418
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:57,583
I KNOW IT.

419
01:20:00,291 --> 01:20:02,250
- Sion: AGAIN,
PEOPLE HAVE DIED.

420
01:20:02,333 --> 01:20:07,083
AGAIN... I FORCED CLAUGH
TO WET HIS HANDS WITH BLOOD.

421
01:20:07,166 --> 01:20:10,666
THE REBELLION...
IT WAS A NECESSARY EVIL.

422
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,458
IT'S FOR THAT REASON
I DIDN'T CHARGE

423
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:13,875
THE COLONEL WITH A CRIME...

424
01:20:13,958 --> 01:20:15,625
I GAVE CLAUGH
THE MILITARY REIGNS

425
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:17,083
HOPING TO SPARE LIVES,

426
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:19,750
EVEN IF ONLY A HANDFUL...
OR NOT.

427
01:20:19,833 --> 01:20:22,375
PERHAPS THIS IS
MY JUSTIFICATION.

428
01:20:22,458 --> 01:20:24,375
- Iris: WHAT'S WRONG,
ARE YOU GONNA CRY?

429
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:26,166
JUST LIKE IN ALL
MY PICTURE BOOKS.

430
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:28,000
THAT IS A FACE
ON THE VERGE OF TEARS!

431
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:30,541
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE SEEN ONE IN PERSON...

432
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,916
FERRIS HAS NEVER MADE
A SAD FACE LIKE THAT.

433
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,541
AND LUCILE IS ALWAYS SMILING,

434
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:37,500
WHICH PERSONALLY,
I FIND KINDA SCARY!

435
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,625
- WELL, LUCILE IS
QUITE TERRIFYING.

436
01:20:39,708 --> 01:20:41,416
- SO ARE YOU GOING
TO CRY OR NOT?

437
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:42,625
- NO, I'M NOT.

438
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:45,000
- DID I COME IN AT A
BAD TIME OR SOMETHING?

439
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:46,333
- PERHAPS.

440
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,791
- I'LL COME BACK THEN.

441
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:51,000
NEXT TIME YOU CRY,
YOU BE SURE TO SHOW ME!

442
01:20:51,083 --> 01:20:52,916
- BEFORE YOU GO,
DIDN'T YOU HAVE A REPORT

443
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,833
FROM RYNER AND FERRIS
TO GIVE ME?

444
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:57,333
- OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.
HERE YOU GO.

445
01:21:00,708 --> 01:21:02,125
- ( laughing )

446
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:05,333
SO THE DOG IS RYNER AND
THE ANGEL IS FERRIS I TAKE IT?

447
01:21:05,416 --> 01:21:07,291
- MMM-HMM. YEP, THAT'S RIGHT!

448
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:10,666
THE WILD ANIMAL IS BEING TAMED
BY THE BEAUTIFUL ANGEL FERRIS!

449
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:13,625
- SAME AS ALWAYS, HMM?
UH, WHAT'S THIS?

450
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:15,625
- OH, THEY DUG UP A REALLY
BIG HOLE AND PULLED OUT

451
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:17,041
SOME KIND OF DAGGER!

452
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:19,041
THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT,
SO THEY THREW IT AWAY

453
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:21,208
AND THEN A DRAGON
APPEARED BEFORE THEM!

454
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:24,916
- THEY'RE REAL. THE RELICS
EXIST. I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

455
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,375
- ( door opens )

456
01:21:27,458 --> 01:21:30,541
- MY LORD.
- AH... WHAT NEWS, MILLER?

457
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:33,958
- HERE.

458
01:21:36,208 --> 01:21:37,875
- YOU'RE CERTAIN OF THIS?

459
01:21:37,958 --> 01:21:40,208
- THE INFORMATION COMES
FROM HIM, YOUR MAJESTY.

460
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:42,416
I AM SURE I DON'T HAVE
