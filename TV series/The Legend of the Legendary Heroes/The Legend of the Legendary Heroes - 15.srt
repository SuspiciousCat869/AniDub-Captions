1
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,458
- Sion: THE RUNA EMPIRE'S
JOINED WITH GASTARK?

2
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,625
IMPOSSIBLE. IS THIS CONFIRMED?

3
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,125
- Miran: MY LORD, AS OF NOW

4
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:29,083
THERE'S BEEN NO OFFICIAL
PROCLAMATION FROM EITHER PARTY.

5
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,833
HOWEVER, WE KNOW RUNA
DID WORK WITH DUKE STEARIED

6
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,125
TO ORCHESTRATE
YOUR ASSASSINATION.

7
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,208
THIS FACT MUSN'T BE
IGNORED, YOUR GRACE.

8
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,458
- ( sighs )

9
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:39,625
WHAT THEN?

10
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,000
DOES THE KING INTEND
TO CARRY ON THE FACADE

11
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,291
OF BEING THIS NATION'S
FRIEND OR WILL HE ATTACK?

12
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,666
- I KNOW NOT.

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,291
I WAS UNABLE TO MEET
WITH THE KING, YOUR MAJESTY.

14
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:51,708
HE'S SHUT HIMSELF INSIDE A
CASTLE WITHIN RUNA'S BORDERS,

15
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:55,208
COERCED BY THE MESSENGERS
FROM GASTARK INTO SECLUSION.

16
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,083
- A THREAT SO GRAVE,
IT MADE THE KING YIELD?

17
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,875
HOW MANY WERE KILLED?

18
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:02,875
APPARENTLY, THE ENTIRE GARRISON
IS PROTECTING THE CASTLE.

19
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,375
- ( sighs )

20
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,916
- THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
YOU SHOULD KNOW, YOUR MAJESTY.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,750
ACCORDING TO THE
INFORMATION I'VE GATHERED,

22
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,125
RUMORS ARE CIRCULATING THAT

23
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,666
GASTARK USED A PECULIAR
POTENT FORM OF UNKNOWN MAGIC

24
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,083
IN ITS FIGHT AGAINST STOHL.

25
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,583
- UNKNOWN MAGIC?

26
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,583
- YES, IT SEEMS SO, HIGHNESS.

27
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,958
APPARENTLY, IT WAS USED TO
COUNTERACT AN OFFENSIVE SPELL

28
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,500
FROM STOHL'S CAMP.

29
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,000
IT NEGATED THEIR MAGIC AND
KILLED MANY THOUSANDS, MY LORD.

30
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,625
- ( gasps )

31
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:29,041
- I MUST ADMIT, I FIND THIS
HARD TO BELIEVE. HOWEVER,

32
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,916
IF THESE REPORTS ARE TRUE,

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,625
IT WOULD LEND SIGNIFICANT
CREDENCE TO THE RUMOR

34
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:33,833
THAT THE RUNA EMPIRE

35
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,833
WAS FORCED TO CAPITULATE
TO GASTARK'S FORCES.

36
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,333
- DOES THIS MEAN GASTARK
HAS BEGUN TO USE THEM?

37
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,958
HERO RELICS.

38
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,375
NO, WE CAN'T LET IT
DEGENERATE TO THE POINT

39
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:48,916
AT WHICH EVERY NATION

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,916
IS FIGHTING AND COMPETING WITH
EACH OTHER TO GATHER RELICS.

41
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,083
WE MUST NOT LET IT COME TO THAT.

42
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,250
- ( theme song playing )

43
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,666
- ( water rippling )

44
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,125
- Ryner: HEY.
- Ferris: WHAT IS IT?

45
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,791
- DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT
HOW OLD SION'S DOING THESE DAYS?

46
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:34,833
- ( sighing )

47
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,750
HE'S THE SAME, NO DOUBT.

48
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,583
ACTING DIABOLICALLY
AND USING DUBIOUS MEANS

49
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,458
TO GET WHATEVER HE WANTS.

50
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:40,875
- YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

51
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,791
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT
IT, THIS IS ALL HIS FAULT!

52
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,125
- WANNA KILL HIM?
- YES!

53
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,541
JUST YOU WAIT, SION,
'CAUSE WHEN WE GET HOME,

54
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,333
WE'RE GONNA MAKE YOU SUFFER
AND SUFFER AND SUFFER

55
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,750
UNTIL YOU DIE!

56
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,625
SO TELL ME,

57
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,208
HOW EXACTLY DID WE
END UP LIKE THIS AGAIN,

58
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,500
DO YOU REMEMBER?

59
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,750
- AS I RECALL, YOUR TYPICAL,
UNRELENTING NEED

60
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,208
TO MAKE SEXUAL ADVANCES
ON THE FEMALE PASSENGERS,

61
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,583
THREW THE SHIP'S CREW INTO
A BLOODTHIRSTY RAGE.

62
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,125
- COME ON, THAT'S A LIE!
FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING,

63
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,500
IT LOOKED MORE LIKE YOU AND
MILK'S MORON CREW

64
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,958
MADE A MESS OUT OF EVERYTHING
AND TORE THE SHIP APART!

65
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,833
- ( people on board screaming )

66
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,958
- Ryner: AFTER WE SENT ARUA
AND KUKU BACK TO ROLAND,

67
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,083
I THOUGHT THINGS
WOULD QUIET DOWN,

68
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,250
BUT THEY CAME BACK
WITH A SWIFT ATTACK.

69
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,625
OH, WELL, GUESS THEY'RE
SAFE NOW, HUH? WHAT IN THE...

70
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,333
- ( wind blowing )
- AW, NO, THIS SUCKS!

71
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,041
- IT APPEARS THAT
A STORM IS COMING.

72
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,750
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
SO CALM ABOUT IT!

73
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,500
NO, NO, NO, NO!

74
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,541
GREAT. I'M GONNA DIE.

75
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,791
( groaning )

76
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,791
HEY, WAIT. I'M STILL ALIVE.

77
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,166
( laughing ) THIS IS GREAT.

78
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,333
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M HERE.

79
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,250
I COULD HAVE SWORN
I WAS JUST DEAD!

80
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,916
FERRIS! HEY, FERRIS!

81
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,291
( sniffing )

82
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,125
SMELLS LIKE SOMETHING'S COOKING.

83
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,625
- Luke: OH, CAPTAIN MILK.

84
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,208
NOT ONLY DID I GET
SEPARATED FROM YOU,

85
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,083
BUT THE WHOLE SQUADRON'S
BEEN SCATTERED

86
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,250
AND THERE'S NO TELLING
WHERE THEY MIGHT BE.

87
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,916
TOMORROW, AS SOON
AS THE SUN RISES,

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,291
I'LL GO OUT LOOKING FOR YOU.

89
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,583
PLEASE, STAY SAFE UNTIL THEN.

90
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,125
- OH, NO!

91
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,000
I MADE ENOUGH FOOD FOR
THE WHOLE SQUADRON

92
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,333
WITHOUT REALIZING IT.

93
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,583
I WISH YOU WERE HERE, CAPTAIN,

94
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,625
I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE CAMPING.

95
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,375
WHEREVER YOU ARE, MILK,
I SWEAR I'LL FIND YOU.

96
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,541
( gasps )

97
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,250
- HE'S A SHARP ONE. THIS GUY
DEFINITELY SAW ME COMING.

98
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,750
DELICIOUS.

99
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,916
THE TASTE HOLDS UP WITHOUT
HAVING ANY OF THE AWFUL SMELL.

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,416
METICULOUS TYPES LIKE THESE...

101
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,333
- ( gasps ) YOU'RE RYNER LUTE!
BUT...

102
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,166
- I KNOW YOU. YOU'RE WITH
THE TABOO BREAKER SQUAD.

103
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,250
- Both: HUH?!

104
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,416
- ( Milk sighing )

105
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,875
I WONDER IF LUKE AND
THE OTHERS ARE OKAY,

106
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,708
AND RYNER.

107
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,375
OH, RYNER.

108
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,583
- Young Ryner: TRUST ME.

109
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:58,541
HOLD ONTO MY HAND AND
DON'T EVER LET GO.

110
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,791
- DON'T WORRY, I'LL SAVE YOU,
RYNER. I PROMISE YOU.

111
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,833
( exclaims )

112
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:13,708
IT'S HER AND SHE'S ALL ALONE!
THIS IS MY CHANCE, RYNER!

113
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,708
( tripping and screaming )

114
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,875
( grunting )

115
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,500
( screaming loudly )

116
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,375
- Ferris: WHAT IS THIS?

117
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,375
WAIT, THAT'S THE WOMAN
RYNER TRICKED AND ABANDONED.

118
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:31,708
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

119
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,583
- I HAVEN'T BEEN ABANDONED
BY ANYONE!

120
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,375
YOU'RE THE BIG MEANIE WHO
ENSLAVES RYNER AGAINST HIS WILL!

121
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,958
I'M ONTO YOU, SISTER!

122
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,458
IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU,
THEN YOU'LL LET HIM GO!

123
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,708
YOU ARE MISINFORMED.

124
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,083
I AM THE VICTIM HERE,
NOT RYNER LUTE.

125
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,333
I AM ENSLAVED.

126
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,666
- YEAH RIGHT, MY RYNER
WOULD NEVER DO THAT!

127
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,375
- YOUR MEMORY OF
WHO RYNER REALLY IS

128
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,041
HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN DISTORTED.

129
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,500
HIS SEXUAL ADVANCES
DON'T EVER END.

130
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,291
HE EVEN SINKS HIS FANGS
INTO MY POOR LITTLE SISTER

131
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,625
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT.

132
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:58,791
( sobbing )

133
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,166
OH, I CANNOT BEAR TO
SPEAK ANY FURTHER!

134
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,083
- ( gasping )

135
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,333
NO WAY! NO WAY! NO WAY!

136
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,416
RYNER'S NOT LIKE THAT,
I KNOW HE'S NOT!

137
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,833
- LISTEN TO ME.

138
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,166
THE OTHER DAY, WE ENTRUSTED TWO
CHILDREN TO YOUR CARE.

139
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,958
YOU DESERVE TO KNOW THE TRUTH,
THEY WERE HIS SECRET CHILDREN!

140
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,041
- YOU LIE!
- YOU THINK ABOUT IT!

141
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,500
DID THEY NOT TREAT
HIM WITH RESPECT

142
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,916
AND SHOW AN UNUSUAL
EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO HIM?

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,583
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

144
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:23,583
IN NELPHA, HE CONSUMMATED

145
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,625
WITH EVERY MARRIED
WOMAN HE MET.

146
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,000
AND IN RUNA, HE KIDNAPPED
INNOCENT VILLAGE GIRLS

147
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,708
BY THE DOZEN,
ONE AFTER ANOTHER.

148
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:33,625
HE EVEN WENT AFTER
SOME OF THEIR MOTHERS.

149
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,208
- OH, BOY.
GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON

150
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,083
WHY I SHOULD
SHARE THIS WITH YOU.

151
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,875
- IT MUST REALLY SUCK BEING YOU.

152
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,416
TABOO BREAKER SQUADRON
IS PRETTY MUCH

153
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL,

154
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,333
AS FAR AS MILITARY POSTS GO.

155
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,666
BUT BECAUSE THE SLAVE
DRIVER KING OF ROLAND IS ALL,

156
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,458
'YOU MUST WORK
FOR ROLAND'S FUTURE!'

157
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,416
SO YOU DON'T REALLY
HAVE THAT OPTION

158
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,791
OF SKIPPING OUT, HUH?

159
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,750
- THAT ISN'T SO. HIS MAJESTY
LABORS AS HARD AS ANYONE

160
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,000
TO IMPROVE THIS NATION
AND KEEP US SAFE.

161
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,750
IT IS NOT SIMPLY
OUR SWORN DUTY,

162
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,291
BUT A JOY AND AN HONOR
TO SERVE SO GREAT A KING.

163
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,791
OH, COME ON. DEEP DOWN,

164
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,250
THERE MUST BE A LOT OF
THINGS YOU WANNA SAY, RIGHT?

165
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,458
LIKE 'I HATE WORKING
LONG HOURS FOR LITTLE PAY,'

166
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,750
OR 'GIVE ME A RAISE
OR ELSE, JERK!'

167
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,916
OR 'EXPAND AFTERNOON NAPTIME TO
OVER TWENTY-FOUR HOURS A DAY!'

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,583
- BUT THAT WOULD MEAN
ALL ANYONE EVER DID WAS SLEEP!

169
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,291
I CERTAINLY CAN'T
ALLOW THE CAPTAIN

170
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,875
TO MARRY AN IDIOT LIKE THIS.

171
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,541
- HMM? WHAT'D YOU SAY?

172
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,250
- Milk: RYNER!

173
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,500
- Both: CAPTAIN MILK?!

174
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,666
- EXPLAIN YOURSELF,
RYNER, RIGHT NOW!

175
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,625
THE SECRET CHILDREN,
THE MARRIED WOMEN,

176
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,333
LOVERS IN NELPHA AND RUNA.

177
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,083
YOU'VE BEEN BUSY,
HAVEN'T YOU? FESS UP!

178
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,250
WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER! IZUCHI!

179
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,625
- Ryner: WHOA! HEY, CUT IT OUT!

180
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,125
- Luke: PLEASE, CAPTAIN MILK,

181
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,708
CALM YOURSELF!
GET IT TOGETHER!

182
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,541
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, FUNBOY!

183
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,875
- WHERE THE HELL IS THIS
COMING FROM, HUH?

184
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,708
FERRIS!

185
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,958
- INDEED, THE DANGO PREPARED
AT THE WYNNIT HOUSE

186
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,541
ARE ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL.

187
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,458
- THE WYNNIT TEA HOUSE,
BUT THAT'S...

188
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,416
- WHOA! WHERE DID YOU
GET THOSE FROM?

189
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,166
- WELL, I BOUGHT
THEM, OBVIOUSLY.

190
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,833
WE ARE WITHIN ROLAND'S
BORDERS, AFTER ALL.

191
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,750
- Ryner: WHAT?!
- IT'S HOUSE ERIS,

192
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:08,916
A TERRITORY OF MY FAMILY

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,583
POSITIONED ALONG
THE COASTAL REGION.

194
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,333
- BUT HOW CAN YOU TELL?

195
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,833
- YOU CAN SEE PART OF
THE ERIS ESTATE OVER THERE.

196
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,333
DO YOU NOT USE YOUR EYES?

197
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,666
- THERE'S NO WAY I COULD
SEE IT FROM DOWN HERE!

198
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,750
WAIT, HOLD ON A MINUTE...
SO, WE ARE IN ROLAND NOW?

199
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,208
- YES.

200
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,583
- ALL RIGHT! HOW ABOUT WE
DESTROY THE ROOT OF EVIL

201
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,416
THAT PUT US THROUGH THIS TORMENT
AND BE DONE WITH IT, HUH?

202
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,416
- YES. ON THE DAWN OF HIS
DEFEAT, LIKE A SUN RISING,

203
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,666
I SHALL TAKE HIS PLACE

204
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,916
AND I SHALL MAKE ROLAND
INTO THE DANGO EMPIRE!

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,375
- COME ON, AT LEAST
MAKE IT THE DANGO

206
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,000
AND AFTERNOON NAP EMPIRE!

207
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,500
- NAPS ARE FINE, BUT
ONLY AFTER EATING DANGO.

208
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
- ALL RIGHT! YEAH!

209
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,625
-Both: DEAL!

210
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,500
- I DON'T EAT DANGO.
DOES THAT MEAN I CAN'T NAP?

211
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,833
- YEP.

212
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,000
- WAIT! HOLD ON A SECOND,
RYNER, DON'T DO THIS!

213
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,791
- ( chuckling diabolically )

214
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,458
FINALLY, WE'LL MAKE THAT
ARROGANT BULLY OF A KING

215
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,583
PAY FOR HIS TYRANNY
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

216
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:01,791
- Ferris: YEAH!

217
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,791
- Sion: "LONG AGO,
THE FORCES OF DARKNESS

218
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,916
CALLED THIS WORLD
THEIR PLAYGROUND.

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,500
"DEMONS, GHOULS, EVIL SPIRITS.

220
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,375
"AT ONE TIME,
THEY WERE SO NUMEROUS,

221
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,666
"CIVILIZATION, AS WE KNOW IT,

222
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,791
ALMOST DIDN'T COME
INTO BEING AT ALL.

223
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,541
"THEN THEY SHOWED UP.

224
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,791
"ANCIENT WARRIORS STRONG ENOUGH
TO DRIVE THE DEMON HORDES OUT.

225
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,666
"HEROES WHOSE STAND AGAINST
THE FORCES OF DARKNESS BECAME

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,750
"THE STUFF OF LEGEND.

227
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,291
"IF YOU COULD DIG UP FRAGMENTS
OF THAT TURBULENT, PIVOTAL AGE,

228
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,666
"MAYBE WE COULD STAND AGAINST
THE FORCES OF DARKNESS.

229
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:42,208
"A WORLD THAT HURTS KIEFER, THAT
KILLS TILE AND TONY AND FAHLE,

230

"IT'S BEST SWAPPED FOR ONE WHERE
PEOPLE CAN CLOSE THEIR EYES

231
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,666
"IN THE AFTERNOON AND NAP."

232
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,041
IS IT BUT A FOOLISH DREAM?

233
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,708
BUT THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

234
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,125
OF COURSE NOT!

235
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,708
IF IT WAS, THEN WHY DID I BECOME
KING IN THE FIRST PLACE?

236
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,833
TO FORGE A PATH TO PROSPERITY.

237
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,791
TO BELLOW THE WINDS OF CHANGE.

238
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,666
TO CREATE A WORLD
WHERE EVERYONE CAN LIVE

239
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,666
A HAPPY, PEACEFUL LIFE.

240
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,666
IS THAT NOT THE REASON
I SO WANTED THIS CROWN?

241
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,583
AND NOW WHAT? WHAT?

242
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,166
SHALL I THROW IT ALL AWAY?

243
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,208
I WILL NEVER GIVE UP.
NOT UNTIL THE DAY I DIE.

244
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:24,958
- ( maid gasps )

245
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,375
SORRY TO DISTURB YOU,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

246
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,625
- NO, YOU'RE FINE. WE ALL
HAVE WORK TO DO, DON'T WE?

247
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,291
- UH, THANK YOU, YOUR HIGHNESS.

248
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,666
I MUST SAY I'M NOT USED
TO BEING TREATED SO KINDLY.

249
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,541
IN MY HOMETOWN OUR LORD
WORKED US TO THE BONE,

250
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,083
AND PAID US ALMOST NOTHING.

251
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,583
BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR
GENEROSITY, YOUR MAJESTY,

252
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,583
EVERYONE IS ABLE TO
LIVE A DECENT LIFE.

253
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,625
I CONSIDER IT A PRIVILEGE
AND A GREAT HONOR

254
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:54,125
TO SERVE SO GRACIOUS A KING.

255
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,291
- WELL, MY HUMBLE THANKS.

256
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,750
- Ryner:
LIKE A TRAVELING PLAYER,

257
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:06,916
HE ACTS THE PART
OF HERO CONVINCINGLY.

258
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,250
THAT WHOLE "NICE GUY" DEMEANOR

259
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,833
AND "CHAMPION OF
JUSTICE" ATTITUDE

260
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,666
ENDEAR HIM TO THE PEOPLE.
THEY DON'T SEE

261
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,041
THE ARROGANT, CRAFTY SLAVE
DRIVER BEHIND THE FACADE.

262
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,375
JUST GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES
WITH HIM AND I'LL SMACK THAT

263
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,458
PHONY SMILE RIGHT OFF
HIS ARROGANT FACE!

264
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,000
- YES, HE'LL BE BUT
RUST UPON MY BLADE!

265
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,291
- OH, RYNER!

266
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,291
WE HAVE TO STOP THIS
MADNESS RIGHT AWAY!

267
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,625
WE CAN'T ALLOW HIM TO
ASSASSINATE THE KING!

268
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,083
- SOMETHING TOLD ME
RYNER WAS MORE

269
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,791
THAN JUST YOUR
AVERAGE TABOO BREAKER,

270
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,291
BUT I NEVER WOULD HAVE
PEGGED HIM FOR AN ASSASSIN.

271
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,000
- EVEN IF HE MANAGES
TO GET AWAY WITH IT,

272
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,125
THE ROYAL GUARD
WILL HUNT HIM

273
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,958
TILL HE'S BURIED
IN THE GROUND!

274
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,666
- WE MUST SAVE HIM FROM HIMSELF.

275
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,875
WE CAN'T ALLOW HIM TO COMMIT
SUCH A HORRIBLE CRIME!

276
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,750
- FEAR NOT, CAPTAIN MILK,
WE'RE WITH YOU!

277
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,791
AS LONG AS I'M STILL STANDING,
NO ONE WILL TOUCH HIS MAJESTY!

278
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,291
( Lach groans )

279
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,083
- ( Milk screams )

280
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,791
- Moe: LACH, NO!
- Milk: PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER!

281
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,500
- Ryner: HEY, FERRIS,
WHAT'S WRONG?

282
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,625
- I JUST FELT A POTENT SENSE
OF DEADLY INTENT IN THE AIR.

283
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,416
OH, WELL.

284
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,291
- SO. WHAT METHODS OF TORTURE
SHALL WE USE BEFORE WE KILL HIM?

285
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,541
- FAIR QUESTION.

286
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,208
HOW ABOUT WE STEAL
SOMETHING PRECIOUS TO HIM?

287
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,875
'NO, NOT MY PRECIOUS THING.
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE, FLOP!'

288
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,083
SOUND GOOD?

289
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,583
- YES, I LIKE IT.

290
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,583
NOW WE JUST NEED SOMETHING
PRECIOUS TO STEAL, DON'T WE?

291
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,041
- OH! HIS DANGO, THEN?

292
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,791
- SOMETHING PRECIOUS
TO HIM, NOT YOU!

293
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,166
- Claugh: WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

294
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,125
- ( all gasp)

295
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,208
- Luke: CLAUGH KLOM.

296
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,875
- THIS IS A SURPRISE,
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU HERE.

297
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,916
I THOUGHT YOU HAD BEEN ASSIGNED
TO THE TABOO BREAKER SQUADRON.

298
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,541
WHAT BUSINESS DO YOU
HAVE IN THE MANOR, LUKE?

299
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,291
- WAIT, SO YOU TWO
KNOW EACH OTHER?

300
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,291
- YES, FROM OUR MILITARY DAYS.

301
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,083
I THOUGHT HIS MAJESTY
HAD DISPATCHED YOU

302
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,000
TO THE NATION
OF ESTABUL, CLAUGH.

303
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,416
- INITIALLY, HE DID.

304
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,375
BUT WIDESPREAD RUMORS OF
ANOTHER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

305
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,333
IN THE WORKS STALLED
MY TRIP FOR NOW.

306
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,041
I CAME BACK TO SNIFF
OUT THE TRAITOR.

307
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,625
- HEY, SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT...

308
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,500
- DO YOU THINK THEY'VE
ALREADY BEEN FOUND, CAPTAIN?

309
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,791
- WAIT, WHO IS 'THEY?'

310
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,458
- ( Milk wails )
- HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

311
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,166
- OH, MY POOR STOMACH!

312
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,833
MY STOMACH HURTS, I HAVE
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM!

313
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,291
I DON'T FEEL GOOD!
- THERE'S NO TIME FOR THAT NOW.

314
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,875
FINE, IF YOU INSIST,
THE BATHROOM'S THIS WAY!

315
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,416
YOU'D BETTER HURRY UP!

316
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,250
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
I'D BETTER GET A MOVE ON!

317
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,916
- HEY! SHE CAN'T
JUST RUN OFF AND--

318
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,416
- OH, IT'S ONLY HER
STOMACH PROBLEMS.

319
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,291
PUTTING THAT ASIDE, I TAKE IT
SION'S THE SAME AS EVER?

320
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,708
- HE'S STILL THE WORKAHOLIC
HE ALWAYS WAS.

321
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,166
SOMEONE SHOULD TEACH HIS
MAJESTY HOW TO TAKE A BREAK.

322
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,208
NOT EVERYONE CAN
KEEP UP WITH HIS PACE.

323
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:40,541
- RYNER, I WILL PROTECT YOU,
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES!

324
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,916
RYNER!

325
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,500
RYNER, NO!

326
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,625
- Ryner: MILK, GET DOWN!

327
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,916
WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER! IZUCHI!

328
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,625
- ( assassin 1 screams )

329
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,083
- ( Milk gasps )

330
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,666
- Assassin 2: PULL BACK!

331
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,000
- Ryner: FERRIS!

332
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,750
YOU OKAY?

333
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,500
- BUT RYNER, IS THIS...
- WE CAN'T REALLY BE SURE.

334
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,333
BUT WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
THAT THEY'RE ASSASSINS

335
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,833
SENT HERE FOR A SOLE PURPOSE,

336
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,291
TO TAKE OUT MISTER BIG.

337
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,750
I GUESS BEING THE KING
ISN'T A BED OF ROSES, HUH?

338
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,625
- SO, THEY'RE NOT HERE WITH YOU?

339
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,500
OH, RYNER, THIS MEANS
YOU WEREN'T REALLY

340
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,166
PLANNING TO ASSASSINATE
HIS MAJESTY AFTER ALL, RIGHT?

341
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,875
- NO. NO, I WAS!
AH, THIS SUCKS!

342
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,833
IF I WOULD'VE USED MY HEAD
AND LEFT THEM ALONE,

343
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,000
THEY COULD'VE TAKEN
CARE OF SION FOR ME!

344
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,583
FERRIS, LET 'EM GO!

345
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,666
IF WE WALK AWAY,
THEY'LL KILL SION FOR US!

346
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,750
- RYNER, YOU JERK, SOMETIMES,
I SWEAR, YOU MAKE ME...

347
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,875
WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER!

348
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,500
IZUCHI! IZUCHI! IZUCHI!
IZUCHI, YOU STUPID IDIOT!

349
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,791
- Ryner: CUT IT OUT!

350
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,583
( Ryner screaming in pain )

351
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,958
- SUCCESSFULLY OPPOSING
GASTARK'S FORCES

352
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,125
WILL REQUIRE A
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POWER.

353
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,916
I MUST PRIORITIZE.

354
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,291
STRENGTHENING MY HOLD
ON ESTABUL IS VITAL.

355
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,125
EVEN IF I ENTRUST THE
MILITARY TO CLAUGH,

356
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,166
THE NOBLES WILL STILL BE...

357
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,791
- ( snoring )

358
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,708
- SON OF A...

359
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,916
HEY, YOU JERK!
- GOOD MORNING TO YOU, TOO.

360
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,333
- GOOD MORNING, MY ASS!

361
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,500
YOU REALLY COULD'VE
BROKEN MY NOSE, YOU KNOW THAT?

362
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,083
- THAT'S THE LEAST YOU DESERVE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

363
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,000
THE OLD BOOK OVER
THE DOOR TRICK?

364
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,583
SO WHEN DID YOU RETURN HOME?

365
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,166
- THIS MORNING.
- WELCOME.

366
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,458
NOW WHAT ARE
YOU DOING IN MY BED?

367
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,875
- IT'S A LONG STORY.

368
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,000
THERE IS SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW, THOUGH.

369
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,375
YOU SEE, I HAD WHAT FERRIS
THINKS WAS AN EPIPHANY!

370
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,916
- IS THAT SO?

371
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,500
- RECENTLY, I FOUND MYSELF
STUCK, DRIFTING IN THE OCEAN.

372
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,708
- REALLY?
- YES.

373
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,833
SURROUNDED BY WATER
AND NOTHING ELSE AROUND.

374
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:59,041
THE OCEAN WAS SO VAST,
AND THE CLEAR BLUE SKY SO HIGH.

375
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:03,083
I HEARD NOTHING BUT THE SOUND
OF WAVES CRASHING AGAINST US.

376
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,458
I FOUND MYSELF
REFLECTING ON MY LIFE.

377
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:08,291
I WONDERED IF I COULD BE
HAPPY WITH THE STATE OF THINGS.

378
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,958
I WONDERED WHY,
DAY AFTER DAY,

379
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,500
IT CONTINUALLY SUCKS TO BE ME.

380
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,291
- IN FULL DISCLOSURE,
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN.

381
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,708
- BUT THEN IT CAME TO ME.

382
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,833
IT'S HIM! HE'S TO BLAME!

383
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,666
THAT ARROGANT, DIABOLICAL
KING OF THE ROLAND EMPIRE,

384
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,208
SION ASTAL, IT'S HIS FAULT!
MY LORD.

385
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,625
- SO YOU'RE ADMITTING
YOU TRIED TO KILL ME?

386
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,916
WITH A BOOK?

387
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,125
- WITH A BOOK.

388
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,000
YOUR EPIPHANY LED
YOU TO BELIEVE

389
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,166
YOU SHOULD TRY TO
ASSASSINATE YOUR KING

390
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,458
WITH A PIECE OF LITERATURE?

391
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,291
- IT'S BLOWING YOUR MIND,
ISN'T IT?

392
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,750
- ( laughing amused )

393
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:44,041
YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.
MIND-BLOWING INDEED.

394
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,458
BUT, RYNER, YOU'RE AWARE
YOU ACTED RASHLY.

395
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,666
AN ATTEMPT ON THE
KING'S LIFE IS SERIOUS.

396
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,166
PARTICULARLY A 'HERO KING',

397
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,083
BELOVED BY ALL PEOPLE
ACROSS THIS CONTINENT.

398
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,500
- OH-HO. YOU'RE CALLING YOURSELF
A 'HERO KING' NOW, HUH?

399
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,583
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO
ASK YOU THIS FOR A WHILE.

400
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,375
WHERE DOES A BELOW AVERAGE
PERSON LIKE YOU

401
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,666
COME UP WITH THIS SHTICK?

402
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,625
- ASCENDING TO THE THRONE
HAS BEEN MY DESTINY

403
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,125
FROM THE DAY I WAS BORN.

404
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,416
- MODESTY BECOMES YOU.

405
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,333
- THE TRUTH CANNOT
BE HELPED, RYNER.

406
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,416
MY CHARACTER JUST
SHINES DIFFERENTLY.

407
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,875
DON'T YOU SEE?

408
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,083
IT'S A BEACON OF PURITY THAT
COMES FROM A STRONG HEART

409
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,250
AND A NOBLE SPIRIT.

410
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,250
- AH! GOD!

411
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,541
YOU LITTLE ARROGANT BASTARD!

412
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,791
NEXT TIME I'LL USE A
BOULDER INSTEAD OF A BOOK!

413
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,916
- HOLD ON, PLEASE LISTEN
TO ME, RYNER!

414
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,500
- Ryner: SION?
- HMM?

415
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,791
- YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED.

416
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,583
- YOU THINK SO?

417
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,416
- YEAH. GET SOME SLEEP.

418
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,875
- NO, I'M FINE. I GUESS
I JUST NEEDED TO LIE DOWN.

419
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,125
- WHAT IS WITH YOU?

420
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,125
I COULD SLEEP OVER
FIFTY HOURS A DAY

421
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,125
AND YOU JUST NEED
TO 'LIE DOWN'?

422
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,458
- WOW, FIFTY HOURS, HUH?

423
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,583
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXPLAIN THE
LOGISTICS OF THAT TO ME.

424
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,000
HOW DID YOU CHEAT SCIENCE?

425
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,458
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
SLEEP MIGHT MAKE YOU NICER.

426
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,166
- SLEEP'S FOR THE DEAD.
- YOU ARE HOPELESS.

427
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,541
- ( doors open )

428
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,500
AN ENEMY OF DANGO IS AN ENEMY
OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS LAND!

429
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:17,166
- RYNER! PLEASE,
DON'T MURDER THE KING!

430
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,416
- Ferris: NO. YOU'VE
BITTEN HIS MAJESTY

431
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,916
WITH YOUR PERVERTED FANGS!

432
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,625
- I DON'T HAVE FANGS!

433
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,083
- HUH? BUT...
YOUR ROYAL MAJESTY,

434
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,750
DID RYNER TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU?

435
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,416
- SO, IT'S LIKE THAT, EH?

436
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,625
I'M SORRY FOR NOT NOTICING
WHAT SEEMS SO OBVIOUS NOW.

437
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,458
THOUGH SOCIETY'S WIND
BLOWS COLD ON YOU,

438
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,125
JUST TRY TO BE HAPPY!

439
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,833
STOP IT! YOU'VE GOT THE
WRONG IDEA, ALL RIGHT?

440
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,750
- ( amused laughter )

441
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,583
- Miran: I QUOTE,

442

END QUOTE. I SEE.

452
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:08,000
SO THEN, THIS 'CAPTAIN MILK' IS
RYNER LUTE'S LYNCHPIN, IS SHE?

453
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,375
SHE'S WHAT KEEPS RYNER
FROM LEAVING ROLAND.

454
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,583
OR TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY,

455
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,000
SHE'S THE SINGLE
THREAD THAT KEEPS

456
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,500
RYNER'S TIE TO HIS
MAJESTY FROM SNAPPING.

457
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,541
AND THAT IS THE KING'S WEAKNESS.

458
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,000
HIS DEEP-ROOTED
FEAR OF RYNER LUTE

LEAVING OF HIS OWN ACCORD.

00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,125
AND THE KING STRIVES
FOR CAN COME TO BE.

463
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,250
A WORLD WHERE PEOPLE
LIVE IN PERFECT HARMONY.

464
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,583
WHERE NO ONE DIES,

465
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:39,208
NO ONE KILLS, AND NO ONE
SUFFERS LIFE'S HARDSHIPS.

466
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,958
AN IDEAL KING.

467
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,500
THAT IS THE CHAIN THAT
BINDS HIS MAJESTY TO RYNER.

468
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,416
THAT SAME CHAIN WILL
STRANGLE HIS GRACE, HOWEVER.

469
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,333
HIS FANTASY OF AN IDEAL KING
ISN'T REAL.

470
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,791
CLINGING TO SUCH ILLUSIONS
BREAKS ONE'S WILL.

471
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,291
IT COULD EVEN BREAK
THE SPIRIT OF KINGS.

472
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,541
IN THAT CASE, RYNER,

473
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,291
IT SEEMS TO ME YOUR
REMOVAL IS NECESSARY.

474
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,416
- ( doors shut )

475
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,541
- ( theme song playing )

476
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,625
- Ryner: IRIS HAS COMPILED
EXTENSIVE REPORTS

477
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,583
DOCUMENTING OUR EXPLOITS.

478
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,958
I'VE A REALLY UNPLEASANT
FEELING ABOUT ALL THIS.

479
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,916
I'M TIRED OF BEING
BOSSED AROUND BY SION.

480
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,875
MAYBE IT'S ABOUT TIME
I HIT THE ROAD.

481
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:52,416
YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS SUCKS.
