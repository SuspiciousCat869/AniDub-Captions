1
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,708
- HE'S LATE.

2
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,041
WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO COMFORTABLY SPLIT

3
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,625
SEVEN BACKPACKS WORTH OF
DANGO BETWEEN US.

4
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,250
EXTREMELY.

5
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:05,916
RISE AND SHINE.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,416
YOU'VE SLEPT ENOUGH TO FILL YOUR
QUOTA FOR THE YEAR.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,875
- ( theme song playing )

8
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:52,083
- HEY, LUKE.
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

9
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,416
THE CAPTAIN'S GONE,
AND IT LOOKS LIKE

10
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,875
SHE'S HASN'T BEEN IN HER ROOM
SINCE YESTERDAY!

11
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:57,958
- THAT'S NOT LIKE HER.

12
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,583
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE GONE
WITHOUT LEAVE.

13
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,916
- OF COURSE SHE WOULDN'T.

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
THAT'S NOT THE CAPTAIN'S STYLE,
WE ALL KNOW THAT!

15
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,458
- YES. YES WE DO.

16
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,583
- ( inaudible )

17
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,708
- SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

18
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,583
- TELL US YOU'VE GOT
SOME KIND OF PLAN.

19
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,958
- CALM DOWN. IN ALL LIKELIHOOD
THE CAPTAIN IS SIMPLY...

20
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,041
- ARE YOU ABOUT TO SPECULATE,

21
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,208
OR DO YOU ACTUALLY
KNOW WHERE SHE IS?

22
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,041
- SHE MIGHT BE IN THE
COMPANY OF RYNER LUTE.

23
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,833
- ( all gasping )

24
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,750
- Eslina: STAY WHERE
YOU ARE, PLEASE!

25
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,416
ONE JUST DOESN'T BARGE INTO
HIS MAJESTY'S QUARTERS,

26
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,791
SWORD IN HAND...

27
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,625
- WELL, HELLO THERE.

28
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,583
- I'M SO SORRY, SIR.
I REALLY TRIED TO STOP HER.

29
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:49,791
- IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.

30
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,666
SHE'S SOMETHING LIKE AN
OLD FRIEND OF MINE.

31
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,583
- BUT, SIR, SURELY
YOU DON'T INTEND...

32
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,166
- ( clattering )

33
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,375
- OH, MY.

34
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,333
- THIS ISN'T OUT
OF THE ORDINARY.

35
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,208
THANK YOU, ESLINA.
IT'S FINE FOR YOU TO GO.

36
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,041
- VERY WELL, YOUR MAJESTY.

37
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,458
- SO, TO WHAT DO I OWE
THIS LITTLE TANTRUM?

38
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,041
- AS OF THIS MORNING,
RYNER'S GONE.

39
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,708
- WHAT?

40
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:19,125
I SEE. IS IT SAFE TO ASSUME
THE PROSPECT OF DESERTION

41
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,291
HELD MORE PROMISE

42
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,708
THAN THE IDEA OF
SHEPHERDING ME TO ESTABUL?

43
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,083
- YOU PLANNED TO ABSCOND
TOGETHER TO SPITE ME,

44
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,416
- BUT RYNER DIDN'T SHOW?
- YES.

45
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,333
- SO A GRAND TOUR OF
THE REGION'S DANGO

46
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,208
DIDN'T APPEAL TO HIM EITHER.

47
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,041
WAS HIS BEHAVIOR AT ALL
ODD YESTERDAY?

48
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,458
- NO. HE DID HAVE A
HEART-TO-HEART WITH MY BROTHER,

49
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,958
THOUGH. APPARENTLY.

50
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,083
- DID HE?

51
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,625
- I HAD A WORD WITH LUCILE
MYSELF BEFORE COMING HERE.

52
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,875
I THOUGHT RYNER MIGHT BE

53
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,833
SKULKING AROUND THE
MANOR GROUNDS, SO...

54
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,833
- AND? WHAT DID THEY
SAY TO EACH OTHER?

55
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,958
- HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW.

56
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,500
LUCILE WASN'T EXACTLY
AN OPEN BOOK.

57
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,708
- ( grunts ) DAMN IT, LUCILE.

58
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,916
WHAT WENT ON BETWEEN
THE TWO OF YOU?

59
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,750
AND JUST LIKE THAT, HE'S GONE?

60
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,583
- HE PROMISED...

61
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,541
HE PROMISED ME
HE WOULD CARRY THE PACKS.

62
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,416
HE GAVE ME HIS SOLEMN VOW.

63
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,083
- Calne: MAJESTY.

64
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,833
HEY, WHERE'VE YOU BEEN
SECRETING THIS DAZZLING NUMBER?

65
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,708
INTRODUCE US AND I WON'T
BETRAY YOUR HIDING PLACE.

66
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,708
OW! WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

67
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,791
- YOU HAD AFFAIRS OF STATE
TO DISCUSS WITH HIS MAJESTY,

68
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:43,666
DID YOU NOT?

69
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,833
- UH, YES I DID IN FACT.

70
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,500
FIELD MARSHAL KLOM
SENDS THIS REPORT

71
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:49,000
FROM THE WILDERNESS OF ESTABUL.

72
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,458
- DOES HE?

73
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,333
AN ESPECIALLY
POWERFUL ALPHA STIGMA

74
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,791
HAS APPEARED IN THEIR MIDST.

75
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:58,208
HE HASN'T SEEN IT HIMSELF,
BUT THE TRAIL IS HOT.

76
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,000
CLAUGH HAS MARSHALED
TROOPS FROM BOTH SIDES

77
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,083
OF THE COMMON BORDER

78
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,166
TO TRY AND ALLAY THE THREAT.

79
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,000
- YOU DON'T THINK IT
COULD BE RYNER?

80
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,541
- THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

81
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,083
THE REPORT WAS WRITTEN
BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED.

82
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,875
- A POINT OF ORDER,
YOUR MAJESTY,

83
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,416
AN ALPHA STIGMA WOULD NOT
BE A WALK IN THE PARK,

84
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,541
EVEN FOR CLAUGH.

85
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,000
- I'LL DEPART FOR
ESTABUL IMMEDIATELY

86
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,708
AND OFFER WHAT HELP I CAN.

87
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,166
THAT WILL ENFORCE
THE NEW RULE

88
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,416
THAT ALPHA STIGMAS ARE TO BE
DETAINED, NOT SLAUGHTERED.

89
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,791
- DETAINED?

90
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,666
- OPPORTUNITIES TO STUDY AN
ALPHA STIGMA UP CLOSE

91
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,333
DO NOT GROW ON TREES.

92
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,500
AND AS FOR RYNER, I CHARGE
THE HUNT AND SEIZURE TO YOU.

93
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,416
EMPLOY THESE TWO AS YOU SEE FIT.

94
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,625
- DOES HE GENUINELY
BEAR AN ALPHA STIGMA?

95
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,125
- THERE'S NO MISTAKING IT.
HE'S REARED HIS HEAD

96
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,291
SPORADICALLY IN THIS
REGION FOR YEARS,

97
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,916
PREYING ON OUR CITIZENS.

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,708
DARK TRESSES.
SWATHED IN BLACK.

99
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,750
EYES LIKE PITCH
GILDED WITH VERMILLION

100
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,750
IN THE DREADED PATTERN.

101
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,166
HE'S NOT A TYPICAL
BEARER, EITHER.

102
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,250
THIS ONE ENGORGES ITSELF
ON HUMAN FLESH.

103
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,291
NEVER IMAGINED MYSELF HUNTING
THE CREATURE DOWN IN CLOSE RANKS

104
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,750
ALONGSIDE THE PHILANDERER

105
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,375
WHO STOLE OUR POOR
PRINCESS'S HEART.

106
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,041
LET'S HOPE ACCOUNTS OF
YOUR BATTLE PROWESS

107
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,708
PROVE AS SUCCESSFUL.

108
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,750
- "DARK TRESSES,
SWATHED IN ALL BLACK.

109
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,625
"EYES LIKE PITCH
GILDED WITH VERMILLION

110
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,250
IN THE DREADED PATTERN."

111
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,875
- ( groaning )

112
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:40,583
- MY, AREN'T YOU A
TASTY LOOKING MORSEL.

113
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,875
- THIS SHOULD PROVE INTERESTING.

114
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,625
- GRENSLADE. CAPITAL
OF THE GASTARK EMPIRE.

115
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,625
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE SUCH
A TRANQUIL TOWN

116
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,791
HOSTS A PEOPLE CAPABLE OF
SACKING A NATION LIKE STOHL.

117
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,500
AND THE FOLKLORE
PECULIAR TO THIS PLACE!

118
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:05,000
STORIES OF RAVENOUS CREATURES
WHO DEVOUR HUMAN BEINGS WHOLE.

119
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,208
DESCENDANTS OF ANCIENT HEROES
WHO SOW CHAOS AND DESTRUCTION

120
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,833
LIKE PLAGUE RATS.

121
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,875
IF THE TALES WE PASS ON FROM
GENERATION TO GENERATION

122
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,833
ARE A TRUE INDICATION OF
OUR HOMELAND'S CHARACTER,

123
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,125
THIS REALM IS A
STRANGE ONE INDEED.

124
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,500
BUT AT LEAST I'VE FOUND
WHAT I CAME HERE FOR.

125
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,916
A PLACE THAT ABOUNDS IN A VERY
PARTICULAR TYPE OF MYTHIC FIGURE

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,041
THE SO-CALLED PEOPLE
OF THE MAGIC EYE,

127
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,750
EACH ONE BEARING
A DISTINCT SYMBOL,

128
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,208
DEPENDING ON THE
NATURE OF THEIR POWER.

129
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,291
THERE'S EBRA CRYPT,
WHICH SIGNIFIES THE ABILITY

130
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,375
TO PEER INTO THE
DREAMS OF ANOTHER.

131
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,583
IINO DUOE, WHICH IS SAID
TO FEAST ON HUMAN LIFE.

132
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,333
AND OF COURSE PROPER
ALPHA STIGMAS, ABLE TO ANALYZE,

133
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,333
COMPREHEND AND
DUPLICATE INSTANTLY

134
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,375
WHATEVER MAGIC THEY ENCOUNTER.

135
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,791
THERE'S ALSO THE TORCH
CURSE AND THE WILL HAME,

136
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,416
BOTH VERY POWERFUL.

137
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,833
AS THE RECORD STANDS NOW,

138
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:53,125
A TOTAL OF FIVE TYPES OF MAGIC
EYE HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED.

139
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,333
AT BIRTH, ALPHA STIGMA
BEARERS APPEAR NO DIFFERENT

140
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,333
FROM ORDINARY HUMAN CHILDREN.

141
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,458
IN SHORT ORDER, THOUGH,
IT BECOMES CLEAR

142
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,500
THAT THEY POSSESS A STARTLING
KNACK FOR DISCERNING TRUTH

143
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,458
FROM FALSEHOOD.

144
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,333
EVEN AS INFANTS.

145
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,208
THE DEEPER ARCHITECTURE OF
REALITY LAYS ITSELF BARE

146
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,458
BEFORE THEIR GAZE

147
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,666
WHEN ALL OTHERS SEE ONLY
THE SURFACE OF THINGS,

148
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,041
MAGIC COMES NATURALLY TO THEM,

149
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,166
BUT WITH THIS GIFT
COMES A PRICE.

150
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,708
CERTAIN TRIGGERS SEND THEM
SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL.

151
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,583
IN THE THROES OF MADNESS,
THEY YEARN TO ERASE TRUTH,

152
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,416
TO DESTROY REALITY.

153
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,708
ONCE THEY'VE REACHED THAT POINT,

154
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,791
AN ALPHA STIGMA IS FOREVER
LOST TO REASON.

155
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,333
AND YET...

156
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,333
RYNER CAME BACK FROM THE ABYSS.

157
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,708
WHAT CAN THAT POSSIBLY MEAN?

158
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,458
DOES RYNER NOT BEAR AN
ALPHA STIGMA AFTER ALL?

159
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,416
IF SO, THEN...

160
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,416
A GODDESS? A DARK, BROKEN HERO
OF OLD AND A SOLITARY DEMON?

161
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,625
- Lefahl: KNEE-DEEP IN STUDIOUS
CONTEMPLATION, I SEE.

162
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,250
( chuckling )

163
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,250
- I DIDN'T NOTICE YOU COME IN.

164
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,708
- AN URGENT SIGN THAT YOU'RE IN
NEED OF A BREAK. GOOD TIMING.

165
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,416
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO
MAKE MYSELF A POT OF TEA.

166
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,000
WOULD YOU CARE FOR SOME?

167
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,666
- YOU CAME TO MAKE YOURSELF TEA?

168
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,000
- ARE YOU SURPRISED?
IT'S MY COUNTRY.

169
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,750
- I'M FREE TO TAKE REFRESHMENT
WHERE I PLEASE.

170
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,291
- OF COURSE, BUT...

171
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,000
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS CHANCE.

172
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,875
AT LAST I'LL SHARE A POT
WITH KIEFER KNOLLS.

173
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,583
WHAT'S IN A NAME?

174
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,625
EVEN WHEN IT BELONGS TO THE
WOMAN YOU'VE FALLEN FOR...

175
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,041
- SO YOU'VE DONE
A LITTLE HOMEWORK.

176
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,583
- NOT AS MUCH AS I COULD HAVE.

177
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,875
- DOES IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE
TO A MAN OF YOUR STATURE,

178
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,666
KNOWING THE NAME OF
A PEON LIKE ME?

179
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,833
- WELL FOR ONE,

180
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,500
IT'S AN EFFECTIVE PREAMBLE
TO BEDDING YOU.

181
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,083
MY MEN WERE POISED TO UNEARTH
QUITE A BIT MORE ABOUT YOU,

182
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,750
BUT I CALLED THEM OFF.

183
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,500
WOULDN'T WANT TO LEECH THE SPORT
OUT OF THE CHASE, NOW WOULD I?

184
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,833
I MUCH PREFER YOU AND I
BE ON THE LEVEL.

185
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,666
- OH, PLEASE. YOU CAN'T
EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE

186
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,375
YOU'RE THAT MUCH OF A ROMANTIC?

187
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,875
FOR ALL YOU KNOW,
I COULD BE ENGAGED IN ESPIONAGE.

188
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,500
- I LIKE TO THINK I'M AN
EXCELLENT JUDGE OF CHARACTER.

189
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,166
BESIDES, I'M SURE OUR MUTUAL
DISTASTE FOR WARFARE

190
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,666
GOES SOME WAY TOWARDS
BRIDLING YOUR CONSCIENCE.

191
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,083
- Kiefer: SHOULD I REJOICE IN
WAR WHEN ALL IT BRINGS IS DEATH,

192
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,500
DESTRUCTION AND PAIN!

193
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,500
- Lefahl: BLOODSHED, TEARS
AND MISERY, I ABHOR.

194
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,958
I'M CONFIDENT WHATEVER
KNOWLEDGE YOU GLEAN

195
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:13,000
FROM THIS COUNTRY'S LITERATURE
WILL BE PUT TO GOOD USE.

196
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:17,125
TO WHICH ENDS, TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF ME TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT.

197
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,708
MY HOMELAND IS YOURS TO ROAM.

198
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,708
JUST DON'T BE
RELUCTANT TO ANSWER

199
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,125
WHEN I CALL IN A
FAVOR DOWN THE ROAD.

200
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,833
- THAT'S VERY GENEROUS OF YOU,
BUT DON'T GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF.

201
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,958
BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, WE SHOULD
AT LEAST SHARE A POT OF TEA.

202
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,125
- WHY, INDEED WE SHOULD.

203
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,166
- IT'S CLOSE BY.

204
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,458
- THAT'S HIM. I'M CERTAIN.

205
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,416
- YOUR EXCELLENCY,
LOOK OVER THERE!

206
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,166
- IT'S HIM.

207
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,333
SO, TODAY'S THE DAY. FINALLY.

208
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,833
- DID HE JUST...
-I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

209
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,541
HE CONSUMED A HUMAN BODY!

210
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,750
- EVERYONE KEEP YOUR CALM!
HOLD RANKS AT ANY COST!

211
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,250
GET IN FORMATION AND
PREPARE TO CAST!

212
00:12:56,416 --> 00:13:00,500
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS. KILL
THE SON OF A BITCH! KILL HIM!

213
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,041
- ( all gasp )

214
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,375
- HUMAN BEINGS ARE SO
EXQUISITELY FRAGILE.

215
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,166
IF ONLY I'D LEFT ROOM
FOR DESSERT.

216
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,750
AH, WELL. I'LL SHOW
MYSELF OUT, THANK YOU.

217
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,208
- SNAP TO! KEEP HITTING HIM
WITH ALL YOU'VE GOT!

218
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,708
- ( screaming )

219
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,333
- I'D LOVE TO PLAY,
BUT I'M SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE.

220
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,500
SO NO OFFENSE, BUT I REALLY
DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

221
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,333
- EXCELLENCY!

222
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,750
- DON'T JUST STAND THERE!
THE MAN NEEDS BACKUP!

223
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,416
- ( grunting )

224
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,791
- ( screaming )

225
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:04,000
- FOR A MERE HUMAN
YOU'RE REMARKABLY FAST.

226
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,333
GOOD. I LIKE A DISH
WITH SOME KICK.

227
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,083
WAIT...

228
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,458
UNBELIEVABLE.

229
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,291
SOMEONE'S GROWN UP TO BE
A CHOICE CUT OF MEAT,

230
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,583
HAVEN'T THEY?

231
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:18,208
SO YOU DO REMEMBER, THEN.
THAT'S EVEN BETTER.

232
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,625
PREPARE TO LAMENT NOT KILLING
ME THE FIRST TIME WE MET,

233
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,000
YOU BASTARD!

234
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,666
( screaming )

235
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,208
( grunting )

236
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,750
- I THINK HE CAN WIN THIS!

237
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,916
- THAT ALPHA STIGMA DIDN'T SEE
THIS COMING. IF HE HAD A CLUE

238
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,375
WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HIM,
HE'D JUST TURN TAIL AND RUN.

239
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,458
- IT MUST BE SAID,
YOU'RE QUITE GOOD.

240
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,875
- HUMAN, HOWEVER...
- Bayouz: I OFFER UP A CONTRACT

241
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,166
TO UNLEASH THE BEAST
OF LIGHT THAT DANCES...

242
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,666
- THIS ONE IS FOR MY FRIENDS!

243
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,666
- THROUGH THE SKIES!

244
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,000
- MY. A BOLD MOVE.

245
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:05,000
I CONSUME POWER
AND LET IT SPRING!

246
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,000
( laughing maniacally )

247
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,791
- ( gasps )

248
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,500
- ( gasping )

249
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,875
- EXCELLENCY!

250
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,583
- WHAT THE HELL HAS HE DONE
TO THE FIELD MARSHAL!

251
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,416
- CRIMSON FINGERED CLAUGH'S
BEEN BESTED BY AN ALPHA STIGMA!

252
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,291
- THAT'S NOT GOOD.
STAND FIRM, ALL OF YOU!

253
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,750
- JUST HOLD ON.
I'M DOING WHAT I CAN.

254
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,875
SIR? SIR?

255
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,541
- Tiir: WORDS CANNOT BEGIN TO
DESCRIBE HOW PLEASED I AM NOW

256
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:54,000
TO HAVE LEFT YOU ALIVE
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

257
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,458
AH, TO BE BRIMMING
WITH SUCH POWER!

258
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,500
WITH WHAT YOU'VE GIVEN ME
I COULD KILL EVERY MAN HERE.

259
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,166
INDEED I JUST MIGHT!

260
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,666
- ( all groaning )

261
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,875
- STOP TRYING TO PUSH
YOURSELF, EXCELLENCY.

262
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,125
WE HAVE TO RETREAT AND
GET YOU LOOKED AFTER.

263
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,041
- DON'T CODDLE ME!
I'M IN NO SHAPE TO RUN!

264
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,583
- LISTEN TO REASON...
- I'M GIVING YOU AN ORDER.

265
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,958
STEP OFF AND LET ME DO WHAT I
CAN TO DRIVE THIS MONSTER BACK.

266
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,625
IT'LL BUY YOU AND THE TROOPS
SOME TIME TO GET OUT OF HERE.

267
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:29,875
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS...

268
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,625
- YOU GOT A PROBLEM DOING
WHAT YOU'RE TOLD?

269
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:35,333
DON'T THINK I WON'T CUT YOU DOWN
FOR DISOBEYING A DIRECT ORDER.

270
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,958
- SIR.

271
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:41,416
- WHEN YOU GET BACK HOME, GIVE
MY REGARDS TO SION AND NOA...

272
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,291
( grunting )

273
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,708
THE HELL?

274
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,916
- WHY DO YOU IMAGINE THE
PRINCESS WOULD GIVE A DAMN

275
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,041
ABOUT REGARDS SENT HER
BY A FIELD MARSHAL?

276
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,125
- VERY FUNNY.
ARROGANT SON OF A...

277
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,250
- PUT ME THE HELL DOWN.
- LOOK!

278
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,750
- PROTECT HIS EXCELLENCY!

279
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:59,166
- CLEAR A PATH SO FIELD MARSHAL
KLOM CAN RETREAT TO SAFETY!

280
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,708
- BLINDSIDED IDIOTS. EVERY
ONE OF THEM TO THE LAST MAN.

281
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,125
- MUST DO YOU PROUD.

282
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,708
TAKES A SPECIAL KIND OF IDIOT
TO BE A ROLAND SOLDIER.

283
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,083
I'M ONLY BAILING YOU OUT BECAUSE
I CAN'T STAND TO SEE YOU PEOPLE

284
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,041
STUMBLE ALL OVER EACH OTHER.

285
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,458
STAND YOUR GROUND, MEN!

286
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,541
SAVE THESE POOR DIMWITTED
BASTARDS FROM THEMSELVES.

287
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,666
ASSUME LARGE-SCALE
CASTING FORMATION!

288
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,083
- WHAT KIND OF STRATEGY IS THAT?

289
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,458
YOU RISK CATCHING YOUR OWN
TROOPS IN THE CROSSFIRE.

290
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,000
- YOUR PAL IN BLACK WILL
ABSORB THE SHOCK

291
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,750
BEFORE THERE'S ANY
COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

292
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,458
SHOULD BUY US A FEW SECONDS.

293
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,125
- FALL BACK!

294
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,625
- DAMN IT ALL.

295
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,875
DAMN IT TO HELL.

296
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,875
- CAPTAIN MILK.

297
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,375
LUKE BAKED YOU A CAKE
TO DIE FOR, CAPTAIN.

298
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,708
YOU'VE GOT NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE MISSING.

299
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,875
- I'M STARTING TO GET
A LITTLE WORRIED.

300
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,750
COME ON OUT, MILK!

301
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,500
- RYNER LUTE CHECKED OUT
OF HIS INN THIS MORNING

302
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,458
AND HASN'T BEEN SEEN SINCE.

303
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,708
CAPTAIN MILK WAS THE
LAST PERSON TO SPEAK WITH HIM.

304
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,291
THE EDICT...

305
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,000
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN CLUMSY OF ME

306
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,333
TO ATTEMPT TO
ORCHESTRATE MATTERS

307
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,083
SO THAT HE'D BE SURE TO SEE IT.

308
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,541
I'M WELL AWARE OF YOUR PRESENCE.

309
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,791
COME, STEP INTO THE LIGHT.

310
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,375
THERE, THAT'S MUCH BETTER.

311
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,291
NOW WHAT CAN I DO FOR
YOU FINE GENTLEMEN?

312
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,375
- YOU SHOULD KNOW WE HAVE
MILK CALLAUD IN CUSTODY.

313
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,166
- AH. AND?

314
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,041
- WE'D APPRECIATE YOUR COMING
WITH US QUIETLY, LUKE STOKKART.

315
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,541
- WHAT IF I WERE TO REFUSE?

316
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,250
- ( chuckles ) YOUR YOUNG
CAPTAIN WON'T SURVIVE THE NIGHT.

317
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,625
- YES, OF COURSE.

318
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,458
COME TO THINK OF IT,
THE CHANCE RYNER LUTE TOOK HER

319
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,208
WITH HIM WAS FAIRLY SLIM.

320
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,708
THIS MAKES MORE SENSE.

321
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,000
THE CAPTAIN DISAPPEARED,
NOT OF HER OWN VOLITION,

322
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,083
BUT BECAUSE YOU ABDUCTED HER.

323
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:08,291
- STOP BABBLING TO YOURSELF LIKE
A MADMAN. JUST DO AS WE SAY!

324
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,458
WHAT THE HELL?

325
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:15,416
- ( thudding )

326
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,291
- THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE MOORED
TO THE SPOT CARE OF MY MAGIC,

327
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,250
SO TRY NOT TO MOVE.

328
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,666
UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'RE
THE TYPE OF FECKLESS,

329
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,083
THICK-SKULLED ROGUE
WHO'D WELCOME OBLIVION.

330
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,083
IF IT'S ALL THE SAME
TO YOU, THOUGH,

331
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,791
I'D RATHER NOT BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE HORRIFIC DEATH

332
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:29,958
OF A FELLOW COUNTRYMAN.

333
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,500
- YOU HAVE NO CLUE
WHERE I'M FROM!

334
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,250
- YOUR MANNERISMS
BETRAY YOUR RANK.

335
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,625
YOU AND YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS
HAIL FROM THE ROLAND MILITARY.

336
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,583
WHICH MEANS THE
PERSON RESPONSIBLE

337
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,125
FOR YOUR CURRENT EMPLOYMENT

338
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,000
AND THE ABDUCTION
OF MILK CALLAUD,

339
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:46,583
NOT TO MENTION THE ATTEMPTED
ABDUCTION OF YOURS TRULY,

340
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,875
CAN BE NONE OTHER THAN
COLONEL MIRAN FROAUDE.

341
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,000
- IMPRESSIVE.

342
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,666
I CAN SEE YOU'RE CERTAINLY A
MAN WHO'S DONE HIS RESEARCH.

343
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,500
- MY DEEPEST APOLOGIES.
I DIDN'T KNOW...

344
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,333
( grunting )

345
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,125
- DO I HAVE THE PLEASURE
OF ADDRESSING THE SUBJECT

346
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,375
OF THAT RESEARCH?

347
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,750
- INDEED YOU DO.
IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET YOU.

348
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,166
I'VE DONE A FAIR SHARE OF
DIGGING ON YOU AS WELL.

349
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,083
TO REMAIN UNDEFEATED IN
UPWARDS OF TWENTY BATTLES

350
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,500
IS A RARE ACCOMPLISHMENT.

351
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,708
PARTICULARLY WHEN ONE
STOPS TO CONSIDER

352
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,166
THAT EACH OF THOSE
LITTLE SKIRMISHES

353
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,291
SAW YOU STAGGERINGLY
OUTNUMBERED.

354
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,458
- YOU HAVE DONE A
FAIR AMOUNT OF DIGGING.

355
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,500
ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE CONSIDERS
THAT IN MOST OF THOSE BATTLES

356
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,958
MY NAME WAS WITHHELD.

357
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,791
MY UTMOST APOLOGIES
FOR CONDESCENDING

358
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,958
TO PIT YOU AGAINST MEN WELL
BENEATH YOUR CALIBER.

359
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:35,041
- TELL ME WHERE YOU'RE
HOLDING CAPTAIN MILK.

360
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,541
- BEFORE WE DELVE INTO THAT,

361
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,791
PERMIT ME TO ASK A FAVOR
OF SOME IMPORT.

362
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,916
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO PERSONALLY
ELIMINATE RYNER LUTE

363
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,333
AS PER THE LATELY
PENNED ROYAL EDICT.

364
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,958
- I MUST RESPECTFULLY DECLINE.

365
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,916
I DON'T SEE WHY HE WOULD
BE ANY OF YOUR CONCERN.

366
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,708
- LET THERE BE DARKNESS!

367
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,333
WHAT IS THIS?

368
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,500
- STRUGGLE THE LEAST BIT
AND YOUR FINGERS,

369
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,208
PROBABLY YOUR ARMS,
WILL GO FLYING.

370
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:59,541
- THAT'S RIGHT. I PROMISED
TO CARRY THE DANGO, DIDN'T I?

371
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:06,416
POOR FERRIS.
SHE'S GONNA BE PISSED.

372
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,666
- ( theme song playing )

373
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,625
- Ryner: CRAP. I SCRAMBLED TO
GET OUT OF TOWN SO FAST

374
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,833
I DIDN'T POCKET ENOUGH SCRATCH.

375
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,208
NOW HERE I AM A DAY
INTO MY ESCAPE

376
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,833
AND ALREADY FUNDS ARE LOW.
UGH! THIS SUCKS!

377
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:50,041
WHY DO WE EVEN NEED MONEY?
EH, NEVER MIND.

378
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,833
WHAT I NEED RIGHT NOW MORE
THAN ANYTHING IS FREE,

379
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,416
A FRIGGIN' NAP.
