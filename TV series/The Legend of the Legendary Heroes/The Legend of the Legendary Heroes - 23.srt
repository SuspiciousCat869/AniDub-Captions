1
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:22,208
- I HAVE DONE AS YOUR
MAJESTY HAS ASKED ME.

2
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,208
THE REBEL IS SUBDUED.

3
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,041
- ( theme song playing )

4
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,416
- ( groaning )

5
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,458
( snoring )

6
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,375
( exclaims )

7
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,000
( chuckling )

8
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,666
YOU KNOW, FERRIS, THIS IS
THE FOURTH STRAIGHT DAY

9
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,666
I'VE BEEN SLOGGING THROUGH
THIS CRAP WITHOUT A BREAK.

10
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,000
I'D SAY IT'S A MIRACLE
SOME MISSTEP BROUGHT ON

11
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,291
BY LACK OF SLEEP HASN'T
LITERALLY BURIED ME ALIVE

12
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,291
UNDER AN AVALANCHE
OF FORM LETTERS,

13
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,875
IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT...

14
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:42,875
- RYNER! RYNER! DON'T YOU
DARE FALL ASLEEP ON ME!

15
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:47,458
- SORRY, I'M JUST TOO TIRED TO
GO ON. REMEMBER ME FONDLY.

16
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,041
- NO, RYNER!
FIGHT IT, DAMN YOU!

17
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,208
THE TWO OF US HAD A DEAL!

18
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,125
WE... WE WERE GOING
TO GET MARRIED.

19
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,791
UH, I DON'T THINK
I REMEMBER THAT PART.

20
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,916
AH, BUT WHAT THE HELL.
IT WAS A LOVELY DREAM.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,500
I'LL DIE A HAPPY MAN.

22
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,000
- NO! OPEN YOUR EYES!

23
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,666
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING ME TO
HANDLE THIS WORKLOAD ALONE...

24
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,250
- I HATE TO BE BEARER
OF BAD NEWS,

25
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,208
BUT THERE'S A
DISCREPANCY IN THE...

26
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,875
- FOR THE LOVE
OF ALL THAT'S SACRED,

27
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:16,041
JUST LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE
WROUGHT! RYNER IS DEAD!

28
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,083
- THE CAUSE OF DEATH
REMAINS A MYSTERY,

29
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,208
BUT OVERWORK IS THOUGHT TO HAVE
PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE.

30
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,916
- STOP HORSING AROUND
FOR TWO SECONDS

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,541
AND LISTEN TO WHAT
I HAVE TO SAY.

32
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,375
- THERE'S AN EXTREMELY...
- NO, NO, NO, NO!

33
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,166
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO HEAR WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING WHEN I'M DEAD?

34
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,625
WHATEVER IT IS,
GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE!

35
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,958
- SORRY.
- YOU'VE GOT A HEART OF STONE.

36
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,125
- HERE'S THE LAY OF THE LAND.

37
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,583
IF THESE DOCUMENTS AREN'T GONE
THROUGH WITH A FINE TOOTH COMB

38
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,125
WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK,

39
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,541
A BIRTHDAY SOIREE OF TRAGIC
PROPORTIONS WILL LIKELY ENSUE.

40
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,000
- A BIRTHDAY WHAT? FOR WHO?

41
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,583
- WHO DO YOU THINK?
- YOU HAVE A BIRTHDAY?

42
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,916
- Miran: "OPEN ENROLLMENT
ESSAY CONTEST.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,458
"TOPIC, CRIME AND PUNISHMENT.

INTRIGUING.

50
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,000
HOWEVER, THAT BEING SAID,

51
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,875
I QUESTION SUCH A CONTEST'S
SUITABILITY AS THE KEYSTONE

52
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:17,708
OF HIS MAJESTY'S
BIRTHDAY REVELS.

53
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,000
THAT SAID, THIS YEAR
THE ANNIVERSARY

00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,791
OF OUR KING'S NATIVITY WILL
BE RESPLENDENT!

55
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,458
( laughing )

56
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:29,333
- ( grunting )
EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY THREE,

57
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,166
NO! DON'T YOU DO IT!

58
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,291
DON'T YOU GIVE
THE HELL OUT ON ME!

59
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,916
I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU YET,
YOU BASTARD!

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,833
- OH, LOOK AT YOURSELF.
YOU'RE TRYING TOO HARD.

61
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,750
TRY WORKING THE MUSCLE
BETWEEN YOUR EARS.

62
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,666
- I CAN STILL KICK YOUR BUTT,
PRETTY BOY!

63
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,250
- HOW ABOUT I JUST GO
TELL LADY NOA

64
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,833
HOW HARD YOU'RE
PUSHING YOURSELF?

65
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,416
- DO IT AND YOU'RE A DEAD MAN!
THAT'S A PROMISE!

66
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,125
- WELL, WELL, LOOKS LIKE
I FOUND THE MAGIC WORD.

67
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,416
SOME INFLUENCE HER
LADYSHIP'S NAME HAS ON YOU.

68
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,541
- ( scoffs ) WELL,
TWO CAN PLAY AT THIS GAME.

69
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,625
HOW ABOUT I GO
AND CHAT WITH ESLINA?

70
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,541
SHE'D GET A KICK
OUT OF LADY PEARL,

71
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,833
OR FOR THAT MATTER
THE WIDOW FAZIA.

72
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,375
- ( exclaiming ) NOW SEE HERE!

73
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,500
NOTHING UNTOWARD HAPPENED IN
EITHER OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES!

74
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,208
- ( chuckling )
NOTHING UNTOWARD, HUH?

75
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,166
- DAMN RIGHT NOTHING!

76
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,541
- WELL, WELL,

77
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,916
I SEE THAT BOTH YOUR MINDS ARE
POSITIVELY SWIMMING

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,666
IN VISIONS OF THE SEASON.
I'M A BIT ENVIOUS, ACTUALLY.

79
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,583
- GREAT! IT'S MR. JOY HIMSELF.

80
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,583
- HEY, NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME
TO PICK A FIGHT!

81
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,333
- IT'S NOT MY INTENTION
TO RANKLE YOU.

82
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,083
ON THE CONTRARY, YOU HAVE
MY COMPLIMENTS, GENTLEMEN.

83
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,916
YOU'VE FILTERED OUT ALL
EXTRANEOUS CONTENT

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,166
FROM YOUR HEADS AND
IN THE PROCESS,

85
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,291
REDUCED YOURSELVES
TO FINE INSTRUMENTS.

86
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,583
TO WHICH END I MAY HAVE
FOUND THE PERFECT USE.

87
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,708
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
I'M GOING TO KILL THE BASTARD.

88
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,833
- YOU'LL HEAR
NO ARGUMENT FROM ME!

89
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,333
- OH, DEAR.

90
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,541
- Sion: RYNER, I'M BEGGING YOU!

91
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,416
- GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES
FOR ALL I CARE!

92
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,916
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ME
TO THE BONE SINCE...

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,166
UH! I DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER HOW LONG!

94
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,166
YOU NEED TO GET SOME SLEEP,
MISTER! OH, AND TRUST ME,

95
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,500
WE HAVE WAYS OF
MAKING YOU FALL ASLEEP!

96
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,666
- NO, NO, WAIT.
- EITHER THIS OR SLEEP FOREVER!

97
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,958
- HMM.

98
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,625
- ( all grunting )

99
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,583
- NAP TIME. THEY CAN
KISS MY BUTT

100
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,875
IF THEY THINK I'M
STICKING AROUND

101
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,833
ANOTHER SECOND
FOR THAT B.S.

102
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:25,958
- HELLO, RYNER. WE'VE REALLY GOT
TO STOP MEETING LIKE THIS.

103
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,958
- IT'S JUST THAT HE TAKES THINGS
SO FREAKING SERIOUSLY, YOU KNOW?

104
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,875
I MEAN ANY OTHER HUMAN
BEING WOULD BE HAPPY

105
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,666
TO CELEBRATE THEIR
BIRTHDAY, RIGHT?

106
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,875
- UH, YEAH, I GUESS SO.

107
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,583
- EVERYONE WANTS TO
THROW HIM A BIG PARTY,

108
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,916
HE JUST DOESN'T LIKE..

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,125
WAIT. HOLY CRAP!

110
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:47,000
I... UH, MAYBE, KINDA TOTALLY
DITCHED YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY.

111
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,958
- YEAH, BUT AT LEAST
YOU REMEMBERED THAT YOU DID!

112
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,708
- YEAH, WELL, STILL SORRY
ABOUT IT, THOUGH.

113
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,916
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I DITCHED IT MYSELF.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,291
I MEAN, A BUNCH OF
CRAZY STUFF HAPPENED

115
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,041
LEADING UP TO THAT NIGHT
AND I COULDN'T GO.

116
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,583
- AH.

117
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:00,750
- IT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME
THAT YOU REMEMBERED, THOUGH.

118
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,500
THAT'S A LOT MORE
THAN I WOULD'VE DONE.

119
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,458
( giggling )

120
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,583
( gasping )
OH, MY, LOOK AT THE TIME!

121
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,958
SORRY. I'VE GOT TO
GET SOME WORK DONE,

122
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,583
SO I'D BETTER BE HEADING BACK.

123
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,083
- OKAY.
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER!

124
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,666
CATCH UP ON YOUR SLEEP.

125
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,083
IF YOU LET FERRIS START
KEEPING YOU UP LATE NOW,

126
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:20,458
YOU CAN KISS YOUR PRECIOUS
AFTERNOON NAPS GOODBYE SOON.

127
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,750
- WAIT, WHAT THE HELL?
AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

128
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:29,166
- Luke: IS THERE ANYONE SWEETER?
- ( Ryner exclaims )

129
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,416
- DESPITE HAVING HER OWN
BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION

130
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,000
RELEGATED TO THE DUST BIN,

131
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,791
SHE SOLDIERS ON GALLANTLY.

132
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,791
- Lear: A CERTAIN
TABOO-BREAKER WE ALL KNOW

133
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:37,916
WHO SHALL
REMAIN NAMELESS.

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,416
- ISN'T WORTHY.

135
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,416
- YOU'RE JUST AS RESPONSIBLE
FOR LETTING HER BIRTHDAY

136
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,666
FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AS I AM!

137
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,291
- WE'RE AWARE OF THAT!

138
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,833
WHICH IS PRECISELY WHY
WE'VE ALL BEEN AGONIZING

139
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,208
OVER OUR OPTIONS WITH REGARD
TO PROPER ATONEMENT.

140
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,291
- ATONEMENT, HUH?

141
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,125
- A MEANS FOR ADDRESSING
AN IMBALANCE!

142
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,333
- YEAH, ADDRESSING AN IMBALANCE!

143
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,291
- OH, RIGHT.
SION'S BIRTHDAY.

144
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,791
- IT ALMOST SLIPPED MY MIND.

145
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,166
I GUESS WE CAN'T AFFORD FOR IT
TO BE AS DULL AND LIFELESS

146
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,125
AS IT WAS LAST YEAR.

147
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,541
- DAMN STRAIGHT WE CAN'T.

148
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,375
OF COURSE IT'D BE EASIER IF SION
DIDN'T DESPISE OPULENCE.

149
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,666
- WE MUST BANISH ALL THOUGHTS
OF THIS CELEBRATION

150
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,208
RESEMBLING IN ANY WAY
THE TEDIUM OF LAST YEAR.

151
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,541
FOR THE SAKE OF THIS
KINGDOM'S FUTURE

152
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,708
I WOULD EMPLOY THE TWO OF YOU

153
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,750
TOWARD A VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSE.

154
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,250
- WELL, PUT IT THAT WAY AND
YOU CAN CERTAINLY COUNT ON US,

155
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,875
MR. RAIN CLOUD.

156
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,833
IN FACT, WE'RE ALREADY
TWO STEPS AHEAD OF YOU!

157
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,750
ALL RIGHT!
TIME TO RALLY THE TROOPS!

158
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,875
- BY WHICH I ASSUME
YOU MEAN THE WOMEN FOLK?

159
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,500
- YOU AND ME ARE ON THE
SAME PAGE, PRETTY BOY.

160
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,458
SEE, THIS IS WHY STORM CROW
OVER THERE NEEDS US.

161
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,625
- LET THERE... NO, NO.
SHOW SOME RESTRAINT.

162
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,208
- NOA WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

163
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,375
- YOU THINK IT'S ALL RIGHT
IF I INVITE ESLINA?

164
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,500
- A DEPLORABLE IDEA
ANY WAY YOU SLICE IT.

165
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,541
INDEED, CRIME AND PUNISHMENT.

166
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,625
- I'M THINKING A BIG STAGE IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE PALACE PLAZA.

167
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,333
- Eslina: OOH AND SOME STALLS!

168
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,208
- THE KEY INGREDIENT HERE
IS PANACHE.

169
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,750
THIS HAS GOT TO BE
THE END-ALL, BE-ALL.

170
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,541
WHAT KIND OF STUFF DO
THEY DO IN ESTABUL?

171
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,750
- WELL, LET ME THINK.

172
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,125
IT IS TRADITION FOR US
TO DISPLAY FIREWORKS

173
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,333
AT ANY LARGE FESTIVAL.

174
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,541
-FIREWORKS, HUH?

175
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,333
- THEY'RE LIKE GIANT
BLOOMS OF COLORED FLAME

176
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,791
THAT LIGHT UP THE
WHOLE NIGHT SKY!

177
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,583
- IS THAT A FACT?

178
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,625
- I'VE HAD A CHANCE
TO SEE A FEW,

179
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,166
BUT NEVER THE REALLY GRAND ONES.

180
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,041
OH, WOW. I'D GIVE ANYTHING T
TO WITNESS THOSE FOR MYSELF.

181
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,375
- SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA.
- YEAH, IT SURE DOES.

182
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,750
THEY'RE JUST THE AMOUNT
OF FLAIR WE NEED

183
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,291
TO PULL THIS THING
OFF WITH STYLE.

184
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,333
- PERFECT, THEN! LET'S MAKE
FIREWORKS THE MAIN ATTRACTION.

185
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,875
- REALLY?
- THERE'S A CAVEAT.

186
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,583
FIREWORKS DO TEND TO CALL FOR
A FAIR AMOUNT OF PREPARATION,

187
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,041
ESPECIALLY FOR A KING.

188
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,291
- A TRULY IMPRESSIVE DISPLAY
CAN TAKE UP TO SIX MONTHS.

189
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,791
- SIX MONTHS!

190
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,708
- THE TIME FRAME WE'VE GOT
TO WORK WITH ISN'T SUFFICIENT.

191
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,666
AT LEAST NOT FOR A DISPLAY
OF THIS SIZE AND AS YOU SAY,

192
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,041
WE DO WANT PANACHE.

193
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,666
- SO I SUPPOSE FIREWORKS
ARE OFF THE TABLE, THEN.

194
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,750
- NO. I THINK I GOT
A WAY AROUND THIS.

195
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,875
- AND THAT WOULD BE?
- TRUST ME.

196
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,000
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHO YOU
RUB SHOULDERS WITH.

197
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,625
- COME NOW, AN ATTITUDE
OF REPOSE IS DISRESPECTFUL

198
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,666
IN THE FACE OF SUCH ARTISTRY.

199
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,250
- SORRY, BUT THIS IS THE BEST
I CAN GIVE IT.

200
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,958
I'VE GOT TOO MANY THINGS RUNNING
AROUND IN MY HEAD RIGHT NOW.

201
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,458
- AH! DOUBTLESS SOME POOR SOUL
YOU DEFLOWERED AGES AGO

202
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,000
IS HOUNDING YOU FOR ALIMONY.

203
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,500
OR MAYBE THE WOMAN WHOSE RICHES
YOU'VE SHAMELESSLY PILFERED

204
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,541
TO PAY HER OFF IS
SUDDENLY WISE TO THE RUSE.

205
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,250
SO YOU'RE TRYING TO IMAGINE
WHAT IT'S LIKE

206
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,625
BEING LEFT FOR DEAD IN A DITCH.

207
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,541
IS THAT ABOUT THE LONG
AND SHORT OF IT?

208
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,541
- SURE, FINE.

209
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,541
- ALL SUCH WORRIES SHOULD BE
PUSHED TO THE BACKGROUND

210
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,250
RIGHT NOW SO YOU CAN
FOCUS ON EATING DANGO.

211
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,166
- GOT IT.

212
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,125
- GO ON.

213
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,291
- WELL, I'M NO EXPERT,
BUT I'VE EATEN THIS STUFF

214
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,083
IN JUST ABOUT EVERY
REGION WE'VE BEEN

215
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,791
AND THE WYNNIT VARIETY
IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE.

216
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,041
- YOU THINK SO?

217
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,750
- IS THIS A NEW RECIPE, THOUGH?

218
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,166
IT'S KIND OF DIFFERENT,
BUT IT'S GOOD.

219
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,500
- HMM.

220
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,125
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- NOTHING.

221
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,166
- THE RECIPE'S SCORED HIGH MARKS
WITH YOUR PARTNER, MISS FERRIS.

222
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,333
I TOLD YOU IT WOULD, DIDN'T I?

223
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,416
- UH, THAT'S ENOUGH.

224
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,791
- WHAT YOU'RE EATING, YOUNG MAN,

225
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:59,125
IS A BRAND NEW CONCOCTION MISS
FERRIS CAME UP WITH.

226
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:03,125
- YOU INVENTED THIS FLAVOR
ALL BY YOURSELF?

227
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,000
- I'VE GOT SOME
SERIOUS COMPETITION

228
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,458
WHEN SHE FINALLY OPENS UP HER
OWN DANGO SHOP.

229
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,375
- WAIT, WHEN SHE WHAT?
OF COURSE.

230
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,875
WHY DIDN'T I SEE IT BEFORE?

231
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,833
NO ONE'S TAKES DANGO MORE
SERIOUSLY THAN YOU.

232
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,833
- BECAUSE UNLIKE
SOME PEOPLE I KNOW,

233
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,916
I'M FULLY AWARE OF HOW IMPORTANT
IT IS TO PAY MY RESPECTS

234
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,166
TO THE GREAT DANGO GOD!

235
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,125
- YEAH, ABOUT THAT...
DANGO GOD?

236
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,291
- HE IS THE ARBITER
OF ALL THINGS EXQUISITE.

237
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,958
THOSE WHO IGNORE HIM TURN THEIR
BACKS ON THE WHOLE WORLD.

238
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,958
- AND THEY DO SO AT THEIR PERIL!
- OKAY.

239
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,583
- Claugh: HEY, HEY!
IF IT ISN'T HE WHO NAPS.

240
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,541
- YEAH. PLEASE FORGIVE
OUR LITTLE INTRUSION.

241
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,708
WE'VE COME HERE
TO COMMANDEER YOUR SERVICES.

242
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,666
- Claugh: ON YOUR FEET!
- ( loud thumping )

243
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,916
- Ryner: WHAT THE HELL?

244
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,625
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! GET
YOUR HANDS OFF ME!

245
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,958
- WE CAN DO THIS THE HARD WAY
OR THE EASY WAY.

246
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,875
I CAN'T GET ON MY FEET
IF YOU'RE DRAGGING ME!

247
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,875
- SO THE SORRY LETCH'S
CALAMITOUS MISDEEDS

248
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,083
FINALLY CATCH UP WITH HIM.

249
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,708
- ( chattering indistinctly )

250
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,750
- NICE TO HAVE KNOWN YOU,
PERVERT.

251
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,625
- Sion: CAN'T WE GO FASTER?

252
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,375
- NO, SIR!
IT'S ALREADY TOO DANGEROUS!

253
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,583
- DAMN IT. THE PREPARATIONS
SHOULD BE IN PLACE BY NOW.

254
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:24,708
- ( chuckling ) THE JIG IS UP.
NO ESCAPE FOR YOU.

255
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,416
AT LAST, THE MOMENT
I'VE BEEN DREAMING OF.

256
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,083
THE REDHEADED WALL OF
MEAT THAT'S HAD ME

257
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,375
IN VIRTUAL SHACKLES FOR DAYS

258
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,125
IS JUST AS BAD AS YOU ARE!
AND YOU...

259
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,250
WHAT THE HELL GIVES
YOU THE RIGHT TO RUN

260
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,458
YOUR HAPPY ASS OUT OF TOWN

261
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,500
- WHILE I'M TREATED
LIKE A FREAKING SLAVE!

262
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,958
- KNOCK IT OFF!

263
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,750
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
ARE YOU MICE OR ARE YOU MEN?

264
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,083
- ( all chuckling )

265
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,083
- ( all yelling )

266
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,500
- Sion: WHAT IS THE
MEANING OF THIS?

267
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,625
- THAT'S RIGHT, MEN! AWAY!

268
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,416
- COME ON! COME ON!
LET'S GO! THIS WAY!

269
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,625
- I HAVE WORK TO DO!
PUT ME DOWN THIS INSTANT...

270
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,458
- BYE! HAVE FUN.

271
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,875
- ♪ FOR HE'S A JOLLY-GOOD FELLOW
FOR HE'S A JOLLY-GOOD FELLOW ♪

272
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,541
- ( people cheering )

273
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:24,000
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU,
YOUR MAJESTY!

274
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,750
- I CAN SEE HIM!

275
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,708
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SION!
- YOUR MAJESTY!

276
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,958
- SIR. WE'RE ALL WAITING
ON YOU, YOUR MAJESTY.

277
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,208
I KNOW IT'S SHORT NOTICE, BUT
COULD YOU IGNITE THE FIREWORKS?

278
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,333
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

279
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,416
- WE PREPARED THEM
ESPECIALLY FOR YOU.

280
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,291
- BUT THAT'S ABSURDLY
EXTRAVAGANT. THE BUDGET WON'T...

281
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,750
- COME ON! JUST HAVE A LOOK.

282
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,958
- MAY ALL YOUR WISHES
COME TRUE, MY KING!

283
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,625
- I LOVE YOU, YOUR MAJESTY!

284
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,291
- SEEMS EVERYONE IN THE KINGDOM
IS READY TO CELEBRATE THIS DAY

285
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,666
BUT YOU, SIR.

286
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,541
- SURELY IT WOULD BE GOOD FORM
TO REPAY THE HONOR.

287
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,375
- I SUPPOSE YOU'RE
RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

288
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,000
- TRAIN YOUR EYES ON THE
MOUNTAIN RANGE IN FRONT OF US.

289
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,625
FIRE AN IZUCHI IN THE DIRECTION
OF THAT TINY FLECK OF LIGHT

290
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,166
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

291
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,791
- THAT I CAN DO.

292
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,625
WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER.
IZUCHI!

293
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

294
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,583
- THAT'S SO COOL!
- WOW!

295
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:08,333
- All: AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY
TO OUR VERY FAVORITE CAPTAIN!

296
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,083
- SERIOUSLY, YOU GUYS?

297
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,333
- FEAST YOUR EYES
ON THIS LITTLE WISH.

298
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,166
- Milk: "HAPPY BIRTHDAY"

299
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,125
- I'M SPEECHLESS. YOU...
- AHEM...

300
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,791
- All: YOUR ATTENTION
PLEASE, CAPTAIN.

301
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,916
- NOW, ARE WE READY, GENTLEMEN?
FIVE!

302
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,208
- FOUR!
- THREE!

303
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,875
- TWO!
- AND ONE!

304
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,875
- ( giggling )

305
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,583
- ( people chattering )

306
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,708
- HEY, JUST WHERE
DOES HE THINK HE'S GOING?

307
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,125
- RIGHT. NO MORE WINE,
I PROMISE.

308
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,583
- YOU'RE LEAVING?

309
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,833
- OH! HELLO, YOUR MAJESTY.
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

310
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:37,166
- PREPARE THE CARRIAGE, PLEASE.
I THINK I'D LIKE TO TAKE IT OUT.

311
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,208
- YES, SIR. I'LL CALL
FOR A COACHMAN AT ONCE.

312
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,083
- OH, I'LL DRIVE MYSELF.

313
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:45,083
- SIR?
- I'VE SOMEONE TO PICK UP.

314
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:50,583
WELL, THAT IS... SOMEONE TO
WHOM I OWE A GREAT DEBT.

315
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,750
- ( thunder rumbling )

316
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,000
- AND OF COURSE,
IT STARTS POURING.

317
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,666
OKAY, THEN,
TIME TO HEAD BACK, I THINK.

318
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,791
THANKS.
YOU'RE A REAL LIFE-SAVER.

319
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,750
- IT IS I WHO SHOULD
BE THANKING YOU.

320
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,750
- HUH? FOR WHAT?

321
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,375
- YOU ARE THE ONE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE FIREWORKS THIS EVENING,

322
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,500
ARE YOU NOT?

323
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,708
- OH, THAT. WELL, YEAH.

324
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,166
- THE ROAD'S A BIT TREACHEROUS.

325
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,375
DO YOU MIND IF WE STOP OFF
SOMEWHERE FOR A WHILE?

326
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,500
- JUST TO BE SAFE?

327
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,541
- YOU'RE DRIVING. DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

328
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,083
- VERY WELL, THEN.

329
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,083
- HUH. CONVENIENT, HUH?

330
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,583
THIS PLACE BRINGS BACK
A LOT OF MEMORIES, DOESN'T IT?

331
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:15,625
- I SHOULD HOPE SO. IT'S WHERE
I FIRST MADE MY OFFER TO YOU...

332
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,916
- RYNER?
- HUH?

333
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,333
- WHEN I SAID THANK YOU
FOR TONIGHT, I DID MEAN IT.

334
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:24,208
- YEAH, WELL, I GUESS EVEN I
CAN BE NICE SOMETIMES.

335
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,375
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

336
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,083
I'M TOTALLY TAKING A NAP
WHEN WE GET BACK.

337
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,583
- DON'T START COUNTING SHEEP
JUST YET, MY FRIEND.

338
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,916
THERE'S STILL WORK TO BE DONE.

339
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,916
- OH, COME ON, GIVE IT A REST.

340
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,875
YOU REALLY ARE GOING TO HAVE
MY DEATH ON YOUR CONSCIENCE

341
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,458
IF THIS KEEPS UP.

342
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,583
- I SUPPOSE WORKING FOR
TEN DAYS WITHOUT A BREAK

343
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,083
DOESN'T COME EASILY TO YOU.

344
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,416
- YEAH, ABOUT THAT,

345
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,000
IT'D HAVE BEEN NICE IF
YOU'D RECOGNIZED THAT

346
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:47,041
A COUPLE OF DAYS INTO IT
OR ON THE FIRST DAY.

347
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,541
- MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

348
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,791
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE HEAD BACK,
GET OURSELVES SOME SLEEP?

349
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,875
- HELL, YES!
BEST PLAN YOU'VE EVER HAD.

350
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,500
- YOU'LL BE AT THE INN?
I'LL SEND A CARRIAGE FOR YOU

351
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,500
SO WE CAN PICK UP
WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

352
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:02,041
- NICE TRY.
- WILL THREE HOURS DO THE TRICK?

353
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,083
- WHAT? I'M SLEEP DEPRIVED HERE!

354
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,250
I'M GOING TO NEED A LOT MORE
THAN THREE FREAKING HOURS!

355
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,916
- HOW MANY HOURS
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO WAIT?

356
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,458
- HOW ABOUT THREE HUNDRED?

357
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,666
- FUNNY, BUT AFRAID NOT. HOW
ABOUT I SEND FOR YOU IN FOUR?

358
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,208
- THAT'S NOT EVEN FAIR!

359
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,500
I'M NOT THE ONLY PERSON YOU
SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HERE.

360
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:21,166
YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T HAD PROPER
SLEEP IN GOD KNOWS HOW LONG.

361
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,625
- IT'S THE NATURE OF THE
BEAST AND THE PRICE I PAY

362
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,375
FOR WANTING TO CHANGE THE WORLD.

363
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,916
WE STILL NEED BETTER EDUCATION,

364
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,125
AND HEALTH REFORM,
AND LOWER TAXES.

365
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,333
OUR TECHNOLOGICAL
INFRASTRUCTURE IS FRAUGHT.

366
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,083
THAT'S JUST THE START, SO...

367
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,041
- SERIOUSLY, HOW LONG ARE YOU
GOING TO RUN YOURSELF

368
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,500
INTO THE GROUND OVER THIS CRAP?

369
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,250
UH, LISTEN, SION...

370
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,833
I DON'T MEAN TO
COMPLAIN SO MUCH.

371
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,291
BACK IN THE DAY
WHEN YOU FIRST MADE THAT OFFER

372
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,250
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
OUT OF YOUR MIND.

373
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:07,166
I STILL DO, BUT I DON'T KNOW.

374
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,333
THE FACT THAT YOU WANTED
TO CHANGE THINGS,

375
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,916
IT MEANT A LOT TO ME EVEN THEN.

376
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,791
FEW PEOPLE CARE ENOUGH
TO BE WILLING TO HELP

377
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,750
THEIR FELLOW MEN
RISE ABOVE IT ALL.

378
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,375
YOUR DREAM WASN'T AN EMPTY ONE.

379
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,416
THIS COUNTRY'S CHANGED.
YOU'VE CHANGED IT.

380
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,333
WE LIVE IN A WORLD NOW WHERE
PEOPLE CAN JUST CLOSE THEIR EYES

381
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,416
ON A LATE AFTERNOON AND NAP.

382
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,958
- BUT IT IS AN EMPTY DREAM.

383
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,291
HOW MANY GOOD PEOPLE
HAVE DIED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN?

384
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,125
HOW MANY MORE WILL HAVE TO?

385
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:49,291
HOW MANY WILL SURVIVE
LONG ENOUGH TO SEE IT?

386
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,125
HOW MANY FRIENDS
MUST I SACRIFICE

387
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,291
TO THE WORST OF THIS WORLD
BEFORE IT CHANGES?

388
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,291
- NOW YOU'RE BROODING.
SURE IT'S A HARD ROAD,

389
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,833
BUT THIS COUNTRY WOULDN'T
HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST STEP

390
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,833
WITHOUT YOU.

391
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:02,458
PLEASE, LOOK AT WHAT
YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED.

392
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,000
I KNOW YOU WORK HARD
BECAUSE YOU FEEL GUILTY,

393
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,166
AND IT KILLS ME TO SEE IT.

394
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,041
BUT YOU CAN'T CHANGE THINGS
BY PUNISHING YOURSELF.

395
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:19,041
AND WHATEVER YOU THINK,
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

396
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,250
YOU CAN AFFORD TO TAKE IT
EASY ONCE IN A WHILE.

397
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,375
THE WORLD WILL WAIT.

398
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,083
THERE'S NO POINT IN
SECOND-GUESSING YOURSELF

399
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,833
IF ALL IT DOES IS
PARALYZE YOU, RIGHT?

400
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,666
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

401
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,958
AND BESIDES,
YOU'VE GOT HELP, YOU KNOW.

402
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,583
THAT INTENSE REDHEADED BRUTE,

403
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,291
THE GUYS IN THE TABOO
BREAKER SQUADRON,

404
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,250
HELL, EVEN FERRIS AND I
ARE ON BOARD...

405
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,541
AND LIKE IT OR NOT,
YOUR MAJESTY,

406
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,791
THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT.

407
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:46,250
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BEAR THIS ALL
BY YOURSELF. YOU'VE GOT US NOW.

408
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,083
- DO I?
- OF COURSE.

409
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,708
- IF ONLY...

410
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,791
IF ONLY THAT WERE TRUE.

411
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,833
I CAN THINK OF NOTHING
I WOULD WANT MORE.

412
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:05,416
BUT THE WORLD
HASN'T CHANGED. AT ALL.

413
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,875
- ( theme song playing )

414
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,791
- WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER!

415
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:30,916
- ( yelling )

416
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,458
- IZUCHI!

417
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,083
- ( both yelling )

418
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,708
- Ryner: SON OF A BITCH!

419
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,208
WHY DO THINGS ALWAYS
GO TO SHIT

420
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:44,000
JUST WHEN THEY'RE STARTING
TO GET BETTER?

421
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,833
YOU KNOW WHAT, SION?
I DON'T CARE!

422
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,458
COME AT ME WITH ALL YOU'VE GOT!

423
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,750
I TOLD YOU I WOULDN'T
GIVE UP, AND I WON'T!

424
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:53,000
NO MATTER HOW MUCH THIS TOTALLY,
COMPLETELY, TRAGICALLY SUCKS!
