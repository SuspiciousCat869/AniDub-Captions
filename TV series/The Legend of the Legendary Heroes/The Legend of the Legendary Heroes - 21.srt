1
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,375
WAIT! WHAT IN THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

2
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,875
- ( man grunting )

3
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,833
( screams )

4
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,041
- ( lightning crackling )

5
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,791
- Rigwalz: THEY'VE BEEN
CROPPING UP IN RUNA TERRITORY,

6
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,000
IN A FOREST JUST SHY
OF ROLAND'S BORDER.

7
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,666
- THERE'S NO
OTHER EXPLANATION?

8
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,291
- NO, SIR. SEVERAL OF THE
SURVIVORS REPORTED IT FIRSTHAND.

9
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:20,750
- THE GALL OF IT.

10
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,291
RESORTING TO THE WORST KIND
OF FORBIDDEN MAGIC.

11
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,000
- IF I MAY, SIR.

12
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,250
THE SPY IN OUR CUSTODY
MAY KNOW SOMETHING OF THIS.

13
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,500
- ( theme song playing )

14
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:37,250
- Lafra: PLEASE, RYNER,
YOU HAVE TO SAVE THEM.

15
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,416
- Ryner: I'M DONE RUNNING.

16
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,250
SERIOUSLY?

17
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,916
- MAYBE HE DECIDED TO
CALL IT A DAY FOR ONCE.

18
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,458
- OH, GIVE ME A BREAK!

19
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,791
WILD HORSES COULDN'T DRAG HIM
AWAY FROM THAT STUPID DESK.

20
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,833
AS LONG AS THERE'S WORK, "BREAK"
ISN'T PART OF HIS VOCABULARY.

21
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,375
I'LL BET YOU ANYTHING HE'S
PULLING AN ALL-NIGHTER

22
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,250
AND TOO WRAPPED UP TO
NOTICE WE'RE BACK.

23
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,541
- WELL, THAT IS HIS STYLE.

24
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,375
- HEY! KING WORKS-A-LOT!
WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!

25
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,250
OPEN THE HELL UP!

26
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,833
( in comical tone)
HELLO? YOUR MAJESTY?

27
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,500
HUH? WHAT THE...

28
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,750
YOU'VE GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

29
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,291
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.

30
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,666
YOU TWO CERTAINLY
TROD HOME AT YOUR OWN PACE.

31
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,666
IT'S A GOOD THING FOR US
I'M PATIENT.

32
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,833
- WHAT THE HELL IS ALL THIS?

33
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:24,875
- THANKS TO THE ABSENCE

34
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,666
OF SOMEONE WHO SHALL
REMAIN NAMELESS,

35
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,083
A BACKLOG OF WORK HAS PILED UP.

36
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,125
- DON'T EVEN SAY IT!

37
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,958
- AS LONG AS THERE'S PAPERWORK
TO BE GOTTEN THROUGH,

38
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,708
SAY GOODNIGHT TO SLEEP.

39
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,208
AH, BUT DON'T FRET.

40
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,375
FERRIS WILL BE HELPING TO
PICK UP SOME OF THE SLACK.

41
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,708
- A-HO-HO!

42
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,916
VERY FUNNY, YOU...

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,208
SLAVE-DRIVER!

44
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,708
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
YOUR MAJESTY,

45
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,541
YOU'RE A FOOL TO THINK
I'D CARVE A HOLE

46
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,000
OUT OF MY DANGO-EATING ITINERARY
FOR GRUNT-WORK.

47
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,333
- THAT GOES DOUBLE FOR ME.

48
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,541
- ( door locks )

49
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,583
- Sion: GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

50
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,625
- I HAD THAT KEY,
SPECIALLY CUSTOMIZED.

51
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,916
SO, THEN. LET'S ALL THREE OF US
PUT A DENT IN THE WORKLOAD.

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,208
- STAB HIM.

53
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,000
- UM.

54
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,875
THE GUARDS HAD ME SURRENDER MY
SWORD BEFORE WE CAME IN HERE.

55
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:15,041
- THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE
HOW BIG OF A BASTARD YOU ARE!

56
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,250
NONE!

57
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,000
- WELCOME BACK.

58
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,458
THAT IS TO SAY, I'M EXTREMELY
GRATEFUL YOU SAW FIT TO RETURN.

59
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,875
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

60
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,333
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE,
BUT I AM.

61
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:34,125
- THAT'S ALL VERY WELL, BUT
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

62
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,791
KINDLY OPEN THE DOOR AND LET
ME CONTINUE WITH MY MISSION.

63
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,375
- WHAT?

64
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,291
- BALK ALL YOU WANT, LOWBROW.
MY DUTY IS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE.

65
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,833
THE DANGO SHOPS DEPEND ON ME.

66
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,750
- DON'T YOU EVEN TRY TO
WEASEL OUT OF THIS!

67
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,875
- HOW DARE YOU?

68
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,291
THE DANGO GOD ENTRUSTED ME
WITH THIS MISSION PERSONALLY

69
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,833
AND I INTEND TO SEE IT THROUGH!

70
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,458
- SO, RYNER,

71
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,541
YOU'VE REALLY
COME BACK FOR GOOD,

72
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,500
HAVEN'T YOU?

73
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,375
- HEY, SION.
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

74
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,291
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
ABOUT TO BE SICK OR SOMETHING.

75
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,041
- DO I? WELL
AREN'T YOU FLATTERING?

76
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,833
- ( boy crying )

77
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,041
- I KNOW THAT VOICE.

78
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,708
RYNER?

79
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,375
HEY, RYNER, IS THAT YOU?

80
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,125
HOLD TIGHT. JUST LET ME
GET MY BEARINGS!

81
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,041
YOUR MAJESTY?

82
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,291
BUT HOW CAN...

83
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,333
HOW CAN THAT POSSIBLY BE YOU?

84
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:40,250
- PLEASE KILL ME.
I DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE.

85
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,458
- ( gasps )

86
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,541
- Luke: THE SPELL FROUADE
PLACED ON HER HAS BEEN LIFTED.

87
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,916
WE CAN EXPECT HER
TO WAKE VERY SOON, I THINK.

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,333
- Lear: I'LL GO SEE
KAIWEL, THEN.

89
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,208
- Luke: NO NEED.
HE'S BEEN APPRISED.

90
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:58,416
AND HE'S JUST AS PREOCCUPIED
WITH RYNER LUTE AS WE ARE.

91
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,541
- HEY! TAKE A LOOK, GUYS!
THE CAPTAIN'S AWAKE!

92
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,625
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

93
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,125
SHE'S IN THE PROCESS
OF RECOVERY!

94
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:06,000
USE YOUR INSIDE VOICE!

95
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:09,125
- HELLO. WHERE AM I?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

96
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,791
- Lach: HOW YOU
FEELING, CAPTAIN?

97
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,458
- LACH, PLEASE. AT LEAST BE WISE
ENOUGH TO TAKE YOUR OWN ADVICE.

98
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,083
- THIS IS MY INSIDE VOICE.
- WELL, GOOD MORNING.

99
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,791
SOMEONE DECIDED TO SLEEP IN
RATHER LATE TODAY, DIDN'T THEY?

100
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,625
- I DID?

101
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,375
BUT, I DON'T...

102
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:30,166
( gasps ) HE...
HE TOOK ME.

103
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,750
- Luke: THERE'S NO NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

104
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,708
TRUST ME.
IT'S ALL OVER NOW.

105
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,541
- WHAT YOU SHOULD BE
CONCERNED ABOUT IS FOOD.

106
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,208
I THINK THE OCCASION CALLS
FOR A SPECIAL MEAL, DON'T YOU?

107
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,958
- YEAH, I VOTE FOR CURRY.

108
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,041
- SHUT UP, IDIOT!
HE WASN'T ASKING US!

109
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:51,041
- Lear: HEY! THE CAPTAIN'S
STILL RECOVERING, REMEMBER.

110
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,833
- Luke: IN WHICH CASE
I RECOMMEND PORRIDGE.

111
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,833
- Lach: WE CAN MAKE
A BIG PRODUCTION OUT OF IT!

112
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,666
- Moe: WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

113
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,125
- WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO
CELEBRATE HER BIRTHDAY, GENIUS.

114
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,333
THIS IS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY.

115
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,916
- Luke: YOU'LL GET
NO ARGUMENT FROM ME.

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,458
- Lach: HELL YEAH!

117
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,541
- ( gasps )

118
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:10,708
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT. THEY'RE
HIDING SOMETHING FROM ME.

119
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,291
- Luke: THE SPELL FROAUDE PLACED
ON HER HAS BEEN LIFTED.

120
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,583
WE CAN EXPECT HER
TO WAKE VERY SOON, I THINK.

121
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,291
- Lear: I'LL GO SEE
KAIWEL, THEN.

122
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:22,250
- KAIWEL? AS IN MAJOR
GENERAL CALNE KAIWEL?

123
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,750
THAT'S ONE OF HIS MAJESTY'S
CLOSEST ADVISORS, ISN'T IT?

124
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,916
WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD
LEAR DROP A NAME LIKE THAT?

125
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,500
SURELY THERE'S NOT
SOME CONNECTION

126
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:34,291
BETWEEN THE ROYAL CABINET AND MY
BEING KIDNAPPED BY THAT CREEP.

127
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,291
I MEAN, WHAT CONNECTION
COULD THERE BE?

128
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,208
NOT THAT LUKE AND THE OTHERS
WOULD LET ME IN ON IT

129
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,458
IF THERE WERE.

130
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,416
I CAN TELL THAT MUCH.

131
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
SO HOW DO I GET TO
THE BOTTOM OF THIS?

132
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,291
( gasps ) FATHER!

133
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,458
IF ANYONE WOULD HAVE THE GOODS
ON HIS MAJESTY'S DEALINGS,

134
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,875
IT'D BE A NOBLE.

135
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,458
( screams )

136
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,666
( groans )

137
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,875
NO!

138
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,291
I'M SORRY!

139
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,416
PLEASE STOP!
YOU'RE HURTING ME, FATHER!

140
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,416
HELP ME, PLEASE!

141
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,666
( panting )

142
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,000
IT CAN'T BE.
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

143
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,375
MOM?

144
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,083
DAD?

145
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,250
( crying )

146
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,208
- Luke: I'M AFRAID THE DUKE
AND DUCHESS CALLAUD

147
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,541
HAVE PASSED AWAY, CAPTAIN.

148
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,500
AND, AS I'M SURE
YOU'VE SURMISED,

149
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,791
BOTH OF THEM WERE MURDERED.

150
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,875
- BUT WHY?

151
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,125
- YOU'RE SUCH A GENTLE,
KINDHEARTED SOUL, CAPTAIN.

152
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,541
THE THOUGHT LIKELY
NEVER CROSSED YOUR MIND.

153
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,291
NOBLES ROUTINELY BUY ORPHANS

154
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,875
AND HAVE THEM
TRAINED AS SOLDIERS

155
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,500
SO AS TO SPARE THEIR OWN FLESH
AND BLOOD THE HORRORS OF BATTLE.

156
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,958
IT NEVER OCCURS TO THEM
NOT TO WAGE BATTLES, OF COURSE.

157
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,666
- ( crying )

158
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,416
- THINK OF IT.

159
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,458
WHY GRIEVE FOR SUCH PARENTS?

160
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,208
- THEY...

161
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,500
THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN MONSTERS,

162
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:43,250
BUT THEY RAISED ME
AS THEIR OWN FOR A WHILE.

163
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,875
- TRULY, CAPTAIN,
YOU ARE TOO KIND.

164
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,000
- SO YOU KNEW. YOU KNEW
THAT THEY'D BEEN MURDERED,

165
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,166
AND YOU ALL KEPT IT A SECRET.

166
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,375
YOU KEPT IT A SECRET TO
KEEP FROM BREAKING MY HEART.

167
00:10:55,458 --> 00:11:00,291
BUT NOW, I'M ASKING YOU TO BE
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH ME.

168
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,875
WHAT IS GOING ON? WHAT ROAD IS
THIS COUNTRY HEADED DOWN?

169
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,625
- Claugh: CRIMSON FINGERED
CLAUGH SPORTING AN ARM

170
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,375
AS BLACK AS MIDNIGHT.

171
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,083
KINDA RUINS THE NICKNAME, HUH?

172
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,458
- Noa: YOU REALLY MEAN TO
LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?

173
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,000
- BELIEVE ME, IT'S FOR THE BEST.

174
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,291
I'VE GOTTA GET USED
TO THIS THING.

175
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,541
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S A LOT
OF TRAINING OPTIONS HERE.

176
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,875
- THAT MAY BE,

177
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,333
BUT THE DOCTOR ADVISED YOU
TO GET PLENTY OF REST.

178
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,791
ARE YOU REALLY READY
FOR A TRAINING REGIMEN?

179
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,500
- AW C'MON, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

180
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,166
AND BESIDES,

181
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,291
I CAN NEVER BE THE GUY WHO JUST
SITS AROUND TAKING IT EASY.

182
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,041
- YOU'RE PLUNGING HEADLONG
INTO THE FRAY AGAIN, AREN'T YOU?

183
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,333
- YOU BETTER BELIEVE I WOULD
IF I HAD THE OPTION.

184
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,125
I HAVE TO PREPARE FIRST, THOUGH.

185
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,416
THAT'S THE STORY OF MY LIFE
FROM COVER TO COVER.

186
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,291
I AM A MAN OF ACTION.

187
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,666
- ( sighs )

188
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,166
- IS IT COLD?

189
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,250
- NO. NOT AT ALL.

190
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,750
IN FACT IT'S AS WARM AS IT WAS
THE DAY WE FIRST MET.

191
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,791
- ( clears throat )

192
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,833
GLAD I DECIDED AT THE LAST
MINUTE NOT TO BRING ESLINA.

193
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,375
SHE'S A BIT TOO YOUNG,
FOR THIS SCENE.

194
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,833
- ( both exclaim )

195
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,541
- HEY, THIS HAPPENS TO BE
A LADY YOU'RE ADDRESSING!

196
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,125
- WELL, I, UH...

197
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,625
WONDERFUL TALKING WITH YOU.

198
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,875
( clears throat )

199
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,333
- BYE.

200
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,250
SHE IS SO OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE,
IT ISN'T EVEN FUNNY.

201
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,208
- ( sighs ) SHUT YOUR
INSOLENT MOUTH.

202
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,208
SO, YOU'VE GOT NEWS, THEN?

203
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,833
- FOR THE TIME BEING
THE CALLAUD MURDERS

204
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,000
REMAIN AN ENIGMA.

205
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,208
DETAILS HAVE BEEN
VERY SLOW TO SURFACE.

206
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,416
THAT SAID, I DO HAVE
MY THEORIES.

207
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,666
I THINK NOBLES WHO OPPOSE
SION'S WAY OF DOING THINGS

208
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,125
ARE BEING PICKED OFF,

209
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,375
ONE BY ONE.

210
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,125
- I KNEW THE GUY. CALLAUD
WAS SOLID MILITARY BRASS.

211
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,583
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT,

212
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,791
NOT FOR ALL THE WORLD WOULD
HE PLOT AGAINST HIS KING.

213
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,750
- WHEN I SAY "OPPOSED,"
I MEAN EVEN HONEST DISSENTERS.

214
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,041
- SO, NO ONE IS SAFE.

215
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,291
- NOT IF THEY HAVE
A BONE TO PICK WITH SION.

216
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,250
BEAR IN MIND, TOO, THEY WERE
LIKELY AT ODDS WITH HIM

217
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,375
BECAUSE THEY STUMBLED
UPON SOME SECRET.

218
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,916
- IS THIS FROUADE'S DOING?

219
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
- ACTUALLY, FROUADE
IS CLEAN SO FAR.

220
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,875
EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO
UNCOVER EXONERATES HIM.

221
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,708
HE'S BEEN POKING AROUND, SURE,
BUT THAT'S IT.

222
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,958
- THE HELL'S GOING ON?

223
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,083
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT
SOMEONE'S ON THE MOVE.

224
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,916
THE ONLY QUESTION IS, WHO?

225
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,250
- Ryner: ( grunts ) STUPID SUN.

226
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,375
OH, MAN.

227
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,208
FERRIS OFFICIALLY SUCKS.

228
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,750
- ( grunting )

229
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,583
NO! NO MORE OF THIS!

230
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,958
I'M GETTING SOME DANGO
TO REPLENISH MY STRENGTH.

231
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,000
- WAY TO STAY THE COURSE
LIKE A TROOPER.

232
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,166
- I HATE TO SAY THIS,
BUT YOU'RE REPEATING YOURSELF.

233
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,791
- OF COURSE YOU REALIZE
THAT THE LONGER THIS KEEPS UP,

234
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,458
THE CLOSER I GET TO AN EARLY
GRAVE DUE TO LACK OF SLEEP.

235
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,250
- A SINGLE ALL-NIGHTER
ISN'T GOING TO KILL YOU.

236
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,500
- YOU DON'T FOOL ME
FOR A SECOND, SLAVE-DRIVER!

237
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,250
YOU'RE TRYING TO END ME,
AREN'T YOU?

238
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,541
- ( chuckles )

239
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,000
- IS THAT FUNNY TO YOU?

240
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,000
UH?

241
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,416
- ( sighs )

242
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,958
- ( scribbling )

243
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,083
- SERIOUSLY, HOW DO YOU
KEEP UP WITH THIS BY YOURSELF?

244
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,500
- MY WORK ETHIC, I SUPPOSE.

245
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,541
A BLESSING AND A CURSE, REALLY.

246
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,833
ESTABUL IS FAR FROM STABILIZED.

247
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,791
ON TOP OF THAT,
WE'VE GOT THE UPRISINGS

248
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:47,291
IN NELPHA, RUNA AND GASTARK
HANGING OVER US.

249
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,291
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN TOUCHING ON
THE MAGIC EYE BEARERS YOU MET.

250
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,125
- I MUST TRY TO SECURE THEM
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

251
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,000
- THE PETTY PREJUDICES OF OUR
COUNTRYMEN NOTWITHSTANDING,

252
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,791
WE HAVE TO BRING
SUCH PEOPLE INTO THE FOLD.

253
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,541
NOT JUST FOR THEM,
BUT FOR ALL OUR SAKES.

254
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,791
- HOLD ON. YOU MEAN...

255
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,458
- WHAT I MEAN IS I'M DECLARING
YOU ESSENTIAL TO THE PURPOSE.

256
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,791
- DON'T YOU PREY
ON MY SYMPATHIES!

257
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,166
ESSENTIAL OR NOT,
NOBODY CAN GO ON LIKE THIS.

258
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,166
STOP AND SMELL THE ROSES
ONCE IN A WHILE.

259
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,375
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE
TO DIE FROM OVERWORK.

260
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,041
- AND IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN,

261
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,500
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT
SUCCEEDING ME AS KING?

262
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,958
- HUH?

263
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,333
NOW YOU'RE JUST
TOYING WITH ME.

264
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,208
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL I'M TOO LAZY.

265
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:33,541
- QUITE SO, BUT, I THINK
THAT RATHER MAKES YOU A SHOE-IN.

266
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,125
- ALLOW ME TO REPHRASE THAT.

267
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,333
NO WAY IN HELL
WOULD I WANT YOUR JOB.

268
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,791
IT'S TOO BIG A PAIN IN THE ASS.

269
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,750
- THAT IT IS.
I WOULDN'T ARGUE WITH YOU.

270
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,958
MAYBE I REALLY SHOULD
CONSIDER STEPPING DOWN.

271
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,166
- YOU SHOULD TOTALLY KISS
THIS WHOLE THING GOODBYE!

272
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,041
I COULD INTRODUCE YOU TO
THE PLEASURES OF NAPPING

273
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,375
WHENEVER YOU PLEASE!

274
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:53,000
- WELL, I HAVE TO CONFESS,
A NAP SOUNDS APPEALING.

275
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,291
PERHAPS ONE OF
THESE DAYS I CAN...

276
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,541
IF I JUST FIND THE TIME.

277
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:14,041
- Ryner: YOU, MY FRIEND,
PUSH YOURSELF WAY TOO HARD.

278
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,666
I'M NEVER GONNA WORK
AS HARD AS YOU DO,

279
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,875
BUT SOMEHOW YOU
NODDING OFF BEFORE ME

280
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,083
JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.

281
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:40,333
- SORRY. HOW LONG WAS I OUT?
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

282
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,625
- I DON'T KNOW.
COUPLE OF MINUTES, I'D SAY.

283
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,708
- SERIOUSLY?

284
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,791
- ( yawning ) I'M
CALLING IT A DAY.

285
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,166
THIS ALL-NIGHTER CRAP
IS FOR THE BIRDS.

286
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,625
- RYNER, HOLD ON.

287
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,875
- I'LL NEED AT LEAST
THREE-DAYS SLEEP

288
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,958
IF YOU EXPECT ME
TO DO THIS AGAIN.

289
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,916
SO BACK OFF.

290
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,666
- ( door closes )

291
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,000
- ( chuckles )
YOU'D DO THIS AGAIN?

292
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,458
- ( grunting )

293
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,375
I'M SORRY.

294
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,583
YOU MADE A MISTAKE
COMING BACK, RYNER.

295
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,500
A GRAVE MISTAKE INDEED.

296
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,875
- YOU MUST KILL HIM
WITHOUT DELAY.

297
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,625
- I MADE HIM A PROMISE,
TO CHANGE THINGS.

298
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,791
THIS LAND. THIS WORLD.

299
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,666
- YOU'RE UNABLE TO SEE
THE FOREST FOR THE TREES.

300
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,125
YOU ARE BEING NAIVE.

301
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,250
- THAT'S ENOUGH!

302
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,041
- THE LONGER YOU WAIT
TO DO WHAT MUST BE DONE,

303
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,208
THE HARDER IT WILL BE.

304
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,625
- SILENCE! I WILL NOT FOLLOW
YOU DOWN THAT PATH.

305
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,416
HE IS MY FRIEND.

306
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,750
HE WILL LIVE.

307
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,500
- Miran: YOU'RE MAJESTY?

308
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,750
- Sion: WHAT IS IT?

309
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,375
- FORGIVE ME, SIR,

310
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,333
BUT DO YOU IN FACT INTEND TO LET
RYNER LUTE CONTINUE TO RUN FREE?

311
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,833
BECAUSE IF I MAY BE SO BOLD,
I WOULD'VE MUCH PREFERRED

312
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:08,666
LUKE STOKKART HAD DONE THE JOB
WITH WHICH HE WAS ENTRUSTED.

313
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,083
- HAD HE FOLLOWED IT THROUGH,

314
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,208
I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE KILLED
RYNER MYSELF.

315
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,541
- LIFE FEEDS ON LIFE,
YOUR MAJESTY.

316
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,666
AND ONE WHO RULES MUST BE
INURED TO THAT REALITY,

317
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,708
AS INDEED I IMAGINED YOU TO BE.

318
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,750
AFTER ALL, YOUR HIGHNESS,

319
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,500
YOU DISPLAYED NO SUCH
NIGGLING QUALMS OF CONSCIENCE

320
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,708
ON THE MATTER OF
PURGING YOUR DISSENTERS,

321
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:32,833
OR, TOO WHEN IT CAME TO
EMPLOYING MY SERVICES.

322
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,666
- DO YOU INTEND TO KILL HIM?

323
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,125
- YES, SIR.

324
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,958
ALLOWING HIM TO PERSIST,
WOULD PROVE DETRIMENTAL TO YOU.

325
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:44,625
HE IS A SYMBOL OF YOUR KINDNESS,
WHICH IS TO SAY, YOUR WEAKNESS.

326
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,208
HIS DEATH WOULD FULLY CONSUMMATE
YOUR RIGHT TO RULE US.

327
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,875
YOU WOULD BE A KING UNDISPUTED,
AND ALL WOULD RECOGNIZE IT.

328
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:57,083
THE GREAT SION ASTAL, FOR
WHOM NO SACRIFICE IS TOO COSTLY.

329
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:01,250
FOR WHOM NO CHILDISH IDEAL
OBSTRUCTS THE IRON FIST.

330
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,666
- I WON'T ALLOW IT.

331
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,000
SUPPOSE I SAID THAT?

332
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:10,958
- I WOULD HONOR YOUR WISH, BY
SUBMITTING TO YOUR PUNISHMENT.

333
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,500
- YOU WOULD KILL HIM
DESPITE MY ORDERS?

334
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,000
- IS THIS A TEST, YOUR MAJESTY?

335
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,333
IF SO, I HUMBLY
SUBMIT THAT DEEP DOWN

336
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,666
YOU WISH FOR NOTHING SO MUCH
AS THE DEATH OF RYNER LUTE.

337
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,750
- YOU WILL NOT TOUCH
ONE HAIR ON HIS HEAD.

338
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,625
- ( gasps )

339
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,458
NO, SIR! SAY WHAT YOU WILL, MY
DUTY TO THE THRONE DICTATES...

340
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:34,333
- I REPEAT. YOU WILL NOT TOUCH
A HAIR ON RYNER'S HEAD.

341
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,291
THE MATTER IS NOT
OPEN TO DEBATE.

342
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,083
- SIR, PLEASE.
- SILENCE.

343
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,166
- I DO NOT INTEND TO
STAND IDLY BY!

344
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,458
- SILENCE OR I'LL
HAVE YOU QUARTERED!

345
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,625
WE ARE WELL PAST THE POINT
WHERE TALK CAN SPARE YOU.

346
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,833
- ( door creaking )
- ( exclaims )

347
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,291
- YOU SAY I WISH
RYNER LUTE DEAD?

348
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,208
YOU UNDERSTAND NOTHING.

349
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,041
YOU DO NOT SEE THE WORLD
FOR WHAT IT IS.

350
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,041
THE CRUDE LITTLE MAP YOU'VE
ETCHED UPON IT IS A FANTASY.

351
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,500
- YOU'RE MAJESTY, I...

352
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,750
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU?

353
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,708
- VERY WELL.

354
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,125
I'LL SHOW YOU TRUTH.

355
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,041
DARKNESS AND LIGHT INTERTWINED.

356
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:28,250
YOU WILL SEE THE WORLD AS IT IS,
AND BEHOLD OUR TRUE ENEMY.

357
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,625
- ( chuckles )

358
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,250
( laughs )

359
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,833
- I FEEL LIKE DEATH WARMED OVER.

360
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,583
BUT IT'S NOT FAIR OF ME TO LET
SION DO ALL THE WORK ALONE.

361
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,916
( inhales deeply )

362
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,875
AND HERE I AM,

363
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,500
THE LAZY, CONTENTIOUS
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING

364
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,541
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO LOATHE WORK
WITH A WHITE-HOT PASSION.

365
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,041
STILL...

366
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,375
IT'S WORTH IT TO SOLDIER ON.

367
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,500
- Lieral: RYNER.

368
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,000
- ( gasps )

369
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,625
WHAT THE HELL?
YOU CAN'T BE...

370
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,166
- TOO SLOW.

371
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,416
- ( Ryner groans )

372
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,875
- WELCOME BACK...

373
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,375
MY SON.

374
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,666
- ( theme song playing )

375
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,291
- Ryner: AWESOME!

376
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:43,583
I'VE FINALLY MADE IT SOMEWHERE
THAT DOESN'T TOTALLY SUCK!

377
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:44,875
WAIT A SEC, WHERE AM I?

378
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,875
THIS LOOKS KINDA DANGEROUS.

379
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:51,083
NOT EXACTLY MY IDEA OF HEAVEN,
I GOTTA SAY. OH CRAP.

380
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:52,916
I'M REALLY IN
FOR IT NOW, AREN'T I?
