1
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,500
- ''I LOVE YOU SO MUCH,''
THE MAN AVOWED.

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,583
THE AUTHOR'S USE OF THE
WORD "LOVE" ELUDES ME.

3
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,541
WHAT DOES IT MEAN
IN THIS CONTEXT?

4
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,958
- MUST LOVE HAVE A CONTEXT
WITHIN WHICH TO THRIVE?

5
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:41,583
THE CONCEPT IS TRICKY. IT POINTS
TO A THING BEYOND WORDS.

6
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,750
SUCH ARE MY FEELINGS
FOR MY SISTER.

7
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,416
- I DON'T FOLLOW YOU.

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,500
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT YOU
FEEL FOR ME SOMETHING AKIN

9
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:48,833
TO WHAT IS WRITTEN HERE?

10
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,666
- ABSOLUTELY.

11
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,041
AS DOES OUR MOTHER,
AS DOES OUR FATHER

12
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,000
AND OF COURSE, LITTLE IRIS.

13
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,708
- IS TRAINING A BURDEN?
- UH-UH.

14
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,958
- THEN YOU IMPRESS ME
BEYOND WORDS.

15
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,791
- I TAKE IT YOU'RE BEING
COMPLIMENTARY?

16
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:11,083
- I PREFER TO SAY THAT
I'M BEING AFFECTIONATE.

17
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,791
- ( theme song playing )

18
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,250
- ( gasps )

19
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:53,041
- ALAS MY DAUGHTER IS A
PERENNIAL DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME.

20
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,083
THE UNINTERRUPTED BLOODLINE
OF GREAT WARRIORS

21
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,541
CULMINATES IN HER,

22
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,708
AND SHE CANNOT HOLD A SWORD
AGAINST THE SIMPLEST BLOW.

23
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,666
- I WILL STAND FAST, MOTHER.

24
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,625
( grunting )

25
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:09,208
- YOU SULLY OUR NAME. TO THINK
IT WAS MY WOMB THAT BORE YOU.

26
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,666
YOUR EFFIGY WILL COME
TO SIGNIFY THE FAILURE

27
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,291
OF A ONCE GREAT HOUSE.

28
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,875
- THERE IS HOPE. SHE MAY WELL
BE USELESS AS A WARRIOR,

29
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,083
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING TO
BE SAID FOR HER BLOOD.

30
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,125
IT MAY HONOR THE GENIUSES OF
THIS FAMILY IN LESS OBVIOUS WAYS

31
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,833
THAN IN SERVICE TO THE SWORD.

32
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,083
- NO, FATHER, PLEASE DON'T.

33
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,958
- SHE COULD YET BE A VESSEL FOR
THOSE GREATER THAN HERSELF.

34
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,875
INDEED, EVEN SO PITIFUL A CHILD
MIGHT HONOR THE SEED

35
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:37,791
THAT BORE HER BY
BEARING IT IN TURN.

36
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,208
- I FEAR I DON'T UNDERSTAND
YOUR MEANING, MOTHER.

37
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,375
- NO, I DON'T IMAGINE
THAT YOU DO.

38
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,333
YOU FAIL ME IN EVERY
SENSE OF THE WORD.

39
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:47,875
BUT IF YOU MUST BE A FAILURE,
BE ONE WORTHY OF US.

40
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,166
- ( gasping )

41
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,541
( whimpering )

42
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,500
PLEASE, I BEG OF YOU, NO.

43
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,166
- ( loud thud )

44
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,041
- HELL SPAWN.

45
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,375
- MY SISTER IS NOT AN OBJECT
WITH WHICH YOU MAY SATISFY

46
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,750
YOUR SICKENING WHIMS.

47
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,083
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I SEE.

48
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,750
THEN MY SON, TOO, IS A FAILURE.

49
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,875
HOUSE ERIS WILL NOT SUFFER
A DE-GENERATIVE REJECT

50
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,625
LIKE YOU TO LIVE.

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,166
( groaning )

52
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,833
- I BEG TO DIFFER, FATHER.

53
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,833
PERHAPS IT IS YOU THE HOUSE
WILL NOT SUFFER TO LIVE.

54
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,166
- HOW COULD YOU
HAVE DONE THIS?

55
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,875
- THE GLORIES OF REBIRTH

56
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,250
FOLLOW THE LEES OF DESTRUCTION.
SUCH IS THE CYCLE.

57
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,000
DESTRUCTION, REBIRTH.

58
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,791
- YOU'RE USING THE TECHNIQUE.
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY...

59
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,375
- ( thudding )

60
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,708
- ( gasps )

61
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:17,791
- COME. SLOUGH OFF THE MANTEL OF
FEAR. THE TRAGEDY IS AT AN END.

62
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,916
FROM THIS MOMENT ON, I WILL BE
THE ONE TO PROTECT YOU.

63
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:43,375
AGAIN SHE SETS OUT. THE BOY
MUST REALLY BE SOMETHING.

64
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,541
- ( snoring )

65
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,666
- Ferris: THIS IS NO
TIME FOR SLEEP!

66
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,583
WE'VE AN EMERGENCY ON OUR HANDS.

67
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,291
- YOU HAVE TWO SECONDS
TO GET READY.

68
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,625
- HUH?

69
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,291
- A-ONE, A-TWO... ALRIGHT
THEN, GET ON YOUR FEET.

70
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,791
- Ryner: WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
EVEN DOING HERE THIS EARLY?

71
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,791
- AVERTING POTENTIAL
CATASTROPHE.

72
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,875
WHILE WE'VE BEEN
GALLIVANTING LANDS AWAY,

73
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:08,375
- THE DELICATE ECOLOGY OF DANGO
HERE AT HOME HAS ALTERED!

74
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,625
AN EMBARRASSMENT OF NEW
DANGO STALLS HAVE DESCENDED

75
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,291
ON ROLAND LIKE AN AVALANCHE.

76
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,166
FLAVORS UNKNOWN AND
COMBINATIONS UNTRIED AWAIT.

77
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,125
TELL ME YOUR HEART
DOESN'T BURST INTO SONG!

78
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,250
- IT WILL AFTER A FEW MORE
MINUTES OF SHUT-EYE.

79
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,583
- RYNER, YOU STILL WANT ME
TO BRING YOU SOME...

80
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,583
( gasps ) WHAT IS THIS?

81
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,750
NO, I REFUSE TO ACCEPT IT.

82
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,750
- WAKE UP, HANDSOME.

83
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:32,791
- C'MON SWEETIE. LET ME KEEP
SLEEPING AND DREAMING OF YOU.

84
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,333
- YOU FILTHY PHILANDERER!

85
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,125
- WHATEVER YOU'RE THINKING
RIGHT NOW, THIS IS NOT.

86
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,166
- I TRIED SO VERY HARD
TO RESIST AT FIRST,

87
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,125
BUT HIS MASTERY OF THE
SEDUCTIVE ARTS IS PEERLESS.

88
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,833
- HEY, YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR ISN'T
HELPING THE SITUATION AT ALL!

89
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:51,541
- WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER!
- I'M OFF. HAVE FUN, NOW.

90
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,083
- Milk: IZUCHI!
- Ryner: NO, NO, NO, NO...

91
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,750
- ( explosion )

92
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,208
- AH, SUCH LOVELY WEATHER
FOR DANGO, TOO.

93
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,125
- Milk: NO! LYING, STUPID,
BEASTLY MAN!

94
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,500
- ( Ryner screaming )

95
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,583
- I SEE YOU'VE TAKEN A SHINE TO
THE SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS.

96
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,041
- MY NAPS DON'T GET INTERRUPTED

97
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,708
BY DANGO-OBSESSED
PSYCHO-VIXENS HERE.

98
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:23,875
OR MY BED SET ON FIRE

99
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,458
BY LIGHTNING BOLT
WIELDING STALKERS.

100
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,416
- MY CONSCIENCE GIVES
ME NO END OF NOISE

101
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,041
FOR WHAT I'M ABOUT
TO ASK OF YOU.

102
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,333
- THEN DON'T ASK.

103
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,208
- I WOULD LIKE YOU AND
FERRIS TO ACCOMPANY ME

104
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,333
ON MY TRIP TO ESTABUL.

105
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,708
- SORRY, CAN'T HEAR YOU.

106
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,125
YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEAK UP, OR
BETTER YET, JUST LEAVE.

107
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:45,041
- IT'S AN IMPORTANT MISSION.
I NEED AN ESCORT.

108
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,250
I'M NOT SAFE OUTSIDE OF ROLAND.

109
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,541
- YOU CAN HAVE YOUR
PICK OF BODYGUARDS,

110
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,625
WHAT THE HELL'D YOU
NEED THE TWO OF US FOR?

111
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,250
- WELL, I, I FEEL YOU
BOTH ARE THE ONLY ONES

112
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,416
I CAN TRUST WITH MY SAFETY.

113
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,000
- WHAT?

114
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,625
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACCEPT
MY REQUEST IF YOU DON'T WISH.

115
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:00,750
JUST BEAR IN MIND, AS KING,

116
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,666
I DON'T HAVE TO GO
EASY ON YOU EITHER.

117
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,125
THERE ARE MUCH HARDER JOBS
THAN SERVING AS MY GUARD.

118
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,583
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

119
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,916
I DON'T BELIEVE YOUR NERVE,
THAT WAS TOTALLY A THREAT!

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,916
- OH, SOMETHING ELSE.

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,958
I BRING NEWS REGARDING THE
PRECOCIOUS ALPHA STIGMA CHILD

122
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,166
YOU BROUGHT BACK.

123
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,291
HE'S BEEN PLACED WITH
HOUSE ERIS FOR NOW.

124
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,666
- HOUSE ERIS? YOU MEAN ARUA'S
BEEN PUT UP WITH FERRIS' FAMILY?

125
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,291
- YES, THEIR CLAN IS WHAT'S
COMMONLY REFERRED TO

126
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,833
AS A FAMILY OF THE SWORD.

127
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,291
SO THE BOY SHALL BE
WELL-PROTECTED.

128
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,833
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

129
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,875
- YOU COULD PAY HIM A VISIT
OR I COULD ASSIGN YOU A JOB.

130
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,250
- BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
COME TO THINK OF IT

131
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:37,833
I DO HAVE BUSINESS WITH ARUA.
LET'S REVISIT THIS ANOTHER TIME.

132
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,708
- BEST RETURN TO WORK
BEFORE SLEEP BECKONS.

133
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,916
- ( yawning )

134
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,333
SO MUCH FOR GETTING BACK HOME

135
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,958
AND CATCHING UP ON MY
AFTERNOON NAPS.

136
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,041
- Miller: IT TOOK SOME
DIGGING TO FIND IT,

137
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,875
BUT I BELIEVE THIS IS WHAT
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.

138
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,541
- I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP.
WE'RE ALL IN YOUR DEBT.

139
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,916
- IT'S A MUCH MORE VALUABLE
BOOK THAN I FIRST THOUGHT.

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,625
ONLY A HANDFUL
OF COPIES STILL EXIST,

141
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,375
SCATTERED ACROSS THE
ENTIRE CONTINENT.

142
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,875
- WELL, I'M NOT AT ALL SURPRISED
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

143
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,541
I HAVE EVERY HOPE
IT'LL BE A VITAL RESOURCE...

144
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,291
- FIND SOMETHING USEFUL
AT FIRST BLUSH?

145
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,000
- OH, NO, NOTHING SO
SERENDIPITOUS AS THAT, I FEAR.

146
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,625
IT'S JUST, ONE GETS
ENGROSSED BY THE DATA.

147
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,750
I'LL HAVE TO COMB THIS BOOK
IN FINE DETAIL.

148
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:45,333
- "BEARERS OF THE ALPHA STIGMA
INEVITABLY LOSE CONTROL.

149
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:49,333
"AND LOSING CONTROL,
THEY PERISH, INEVITABLY.

150
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,375
"POUR FAR AND WIDE
THOUGH A SEEKER MAY,

151
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,666
"NO HISTORIC EXCEPTION
TO THIS WILL BE FOUND."

152
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,000
THAT CAN'T BE ALL
THERE IS TO IT.

153
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:11,750
RYNER DEFINITELY LOST CONTROL
ON THE FIELDS OF ESTABUL.

154
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,291
BUT HE SURVIVED.

155
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,875
THERE'S NOTHING NEW HERE.

156
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,125
GASTARK IS SUPPOSED TO BE
RICH IN FOLKLORE

157
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,041
SURROUNDING THE SO-CALLED
PEOPLE OF THE MAGIC EYE, THOUGH.

158
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,125
MAYBE IT'S TIME.

159
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,250
- WHOA.

160
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:47,333
WELL, OKAY.
THAT IS IMPRESSIVE.

161
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,875
- THE HEARTIEST OF WELCOMES
TO YOU, MASTER LUTE, SIR.

162
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,625
YOU DO US HONOR BY YOUR VISIT.

163
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:57,583
YOUNG MASTER ARUA AND
YOUNG LADY KUKU AWAIT YOU.

164
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,250
- Ryner: SO, UH, THE TWO OF 'EM
HAVE TAKEN TO THIS PLACE?

165
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,166
- Kroselli: OH, YES,
QUITE SO, SIR.

166
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,416
THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN BOUNCING
ON THEIR HEELS ALL MORNING

167
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,208
AT THE PROSPECT OF YOUR
COMING HERE, IT MUST BE SAID.

168
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,083
- WHAT'S THAT THING?
- THE DOJO, SIR.

169
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,625
IT FUNCTIONS THESE DAYS
PRIMARILY AS THE DOMICILE

170
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,041
OF HIS LORDSHIP LUCILE,

171
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,666
THE FAMILY'S STANDING PATRIARCH.

172
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,708
- SO THAT'S WHERE FERRIS'
OLD MAN LIVES?

173
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:25,250
- NO, SIR. LUCILE IS HER
LADYSHIP'S ELDER BROTHER.

174
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,541
- WHAT ABOUT THEIR, UH...

175
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,500
- A TRAGEDY, I'M AFRAID.
- I SEE...

176
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,500
IF I CAN BE FRANK WITH YOU,
I BET THEIR DEATHS

177
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,666
WERE A BREATH OF FRESH
AIR AROUND HERE.

178
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:39,625
NO WARRIOR AS SKILLED AS FERRIS
COULD'VE HAD AN EASY CHILDHOOD.

179
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,333
SHE SUFFERED A LOT OF ABUSE
TO GET WHERE SHE IS.

180
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,166
SORRY TO ASK, BUT HOW OLD
WAS SHE WHEN THEY FINALLY DIED?

181
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,666
- THE PRIOR PATRIARCH MET
HIS END ALONG WITH HIS WIFE

182
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,875
AT THE CUSP OF HER LADYSHIP'S
FOURTEENTH BIRTHDAY.

183
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,666
- SCARRED FOR FOURTEEN YEARS.

184
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,791
- THAT'S A HELL OF A LONG TIME.
- QUITE SO, SIR.

185
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,125
BUT, IF I MAY VENTURE
A SMALL RAY OF HOPE,

186
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,083
SHE IS NOW SURROUNDED
BY FINE PEOPLE

187
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,166
LIKE YOURSELF AND HIS MAJESTY.

188
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,291
- Iris: STAND ASIDE!

189
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,166
- ( groans )

190
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,333
- LOOK OUT, KROSELLI!

191
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,541
YOU MUSTN'T LET THE WICKED
BEAST NEAR YOU.

192
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,458
THE SLIGHTEST BRUSH WITH
HIS KIND CAN SADDLE

193
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,000
EVEN THE MOST VIRTUOUS
PEOPLE WITH CHILD!

194
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:26,041
- ( groaning ) OW.

195
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,833
- MR. RYNER!
- LOOK SHARP, GANG!

196
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,875
WE'VE GOT OURSELVES
A WICKED BEAST TO CATCH.

197
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,708
- I'LL COVER HIS LEFT WHILE
ARUA FLANKS HIS RIGHT!

198
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,333
- YOU GOT IT, IRIS!

199
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,541
- LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S
BEEN TOTALLY TAMED BY...

200
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,166
( groaning )

201
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,375
- BIG SISTER FERRIS!
- BIG SISTER FERRIS!

202
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:48,000
- YOU'VE SOME NERVE CAUSING
A RUCKUS ON THESE GROUNDS.

203
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,083
- JUST SO WE'RE
CLEAR, I'M NOT NOW,

204
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,833
NOR HAVE I EVER BEEN YOUR
PERSONAL SANDBAG.

205
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,416
- WOW THIS DANGO STUFF
REALLY IS GOOD.

206
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,500
- I'VE NEVER TASTED
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

207
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,416
- YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
CAN'T POSSIBLY BE FULL.

208
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,375
- NOT ONE OF THEM IS
BLAND, PRECISELY,

209
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,291
BUT THEY LACK ANY SUBTLETY.

210
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,583
PERHAPS MY PALATE IS
OVERWHELMED BY QUANTITY?

211
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,583
DIFFICULT TO SAY AT PRESENT.

212
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,166
I SUSPECT THE FINER OVERTONES
OF EACH INDIVIDUAL VARIETY...

213
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,125
- Kroselli: IT FUNCTIONS
PRIMARILY AS THE DOMICILE

214
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,500
OF HIS LORDSHIP LUCILE,

215
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,291
THE FAMILY'S STANDING PATRIARCH.

216
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,041
- ( whimpering )

217
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,166
( gasping )

218
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,625
( screaming )

219
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,416
- Arua: MR. RYNER?

220
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,625
IS SOMETHING WRONG? YOU
LOOK LIKE YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST.

221
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,250
- OH, IT'S NOTHING.

222
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,833
I'VE GOT A TINY LITTLE
FAVOR TO ASK YOU.

223
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,916
MIND USING YOUR ALPHA STIGMA
TO TAKE A QUICK LOOK

224
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,291
INSIDE THAT DOJO?

225
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,791
- SURE, NO PROBLEM.

226
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,125
IS THIS THE FIRST PART OF
MY NEXT TRAINING LESSON?

227
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,625
- YOU COULD CALL IT THAT,
I SUPPOSE.

228
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,041
IF THINGS START GETTING
DODGY THOUGH,

229
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,958
I WANT YOU TO CLOSE
YOUR EYES TIGHT.

230
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,000
- UNDERSTAND?
- YEAH, I GOT IT.

231
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,541
OKAY, NOW WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

232
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,500
- WAIT, YOU MEAN YOU DON'T,
LIKE, SEE ANYTHING?

233
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,958
- WELL, I CAN SEE
INSIDE THE DOJO.

234
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,875
- RIGHT. VERY GOOD, THEN,
CLASS IS DISMISSED.

235
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,958
- ( snoring )

236
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,000
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
HE ACTUALLY WANTS US

237
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,375
TO ESCORT HIM ALL THE
WAY TO FRIGGIN' ESTABUL.

238
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,416
- SO, WHAT YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY
TELLING ME IS THAT

239
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,958
YET AGAIN WE'RE BEING
WORKED TO THE BONE

240
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,333
BY OUR TYRANNICAL,
SLAVE-DRIVER OF A KING?

241
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,708
WHY AM I NOT THE LEAST BIT
SURPRISED BY THIS?

242
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,708
I SAY WE RESUME OUR SEARCH
FOR HERO RELICS INSTEAD.

243
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,083
- YEAH, THAT'D REALLY GET
HIS GOAT, WOULDN'T IT?

244
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,000
WHEN WERE YOU THINKIN'
WE SHOULD PUSH OFF?

245
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,750
- TOMORROW MORNING. I'M
ASSIGNING THE WYNITT DANGO SHOP

246
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,208
AS OUR SECRET RENDEZVOUS POINT.

247
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,666
- AH. GOTTA STOCK UP
FOR THE JOURNEY, RIGHT.

248
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,208
- WE CAN COMFORTABLY SPLIT
SEVEN BACKPACKS BETWEEN US.

249
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,916
- SEVEN BACKPACKS'
WORTH OF DANGO?

250
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,166
- Kroselli: IF I MAY VENTURE
A SMALL RAY OF HOPE,

251
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,083
SHE IS NOW SURROUNDED
BY FINE PEOPLE

252
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,916
LIKE YOURSELF AND HIS MAJESTY.

253
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,833
- OR HOW ABOUT
I GO YOU ONE BETTER?

254
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,500
I'LL CARRY ALL SEVEN
DANGO-PACKS BY MY LONESOME.

255
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,458
- REALLY? DARE I HOPE.

256
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,833
YOU'VE FINALLY COME
TO APPRECIATE

257
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,416
THE EXQUISITE ART OF DANGO.

258
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,375
METHINKS THIS CALLS FOR
FOURTEEN BACKPACKS!

259
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,041
- THIS IS WHAT I GET
FOR TRYING TO BE NICE.

260
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,208
FERRIS AND THE KIDS
ARE BOUND TO BE OFF

261
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,791
SKIPPING THROUGH
DREAMLAND BY NOW.

262
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,041
TIME FOR ME TO FIND OUT
WHOSE WATCH THEY'RE UNDER.

263
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,458
HELLO THERE. YOU MUST BE
FERRIS' BIG BROTHER, AM I RIGHT?

264
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:20,000
- LUCILE ERIS AT YOUR SERVICE. I
PRESUME THEN YOU ARE RYNER LUTE?

265
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,750
MY SISTER APPEARS TO GET ON
EXTRAORDINARILY WELL WITH YOU.

266
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,750
I'VE BEEN HOPING FOR A CHANCE
TO CONFER WITH YOU IN PRIVATE.

267
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,291
WELL DONE.
YOU DIDN'T EVEN FLINCH.

268
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,750
I'D SAY YOUR POWERS ARE,
FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES,

269
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,125
ON PAR WITH FERRIS.

270
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,375
- NICE OF YOU TO SAY,
BUT I'VE GOTTA DISAGREE.

271
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,541
IF SHE EVER GETS SERIOUS,
I'M A DEAD MAN.

272
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:49,875
- EVEN SO, IT PUTS ME AT EASE
TO SEE HER PARTNERED WITH YOU.

273
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:53,041
YOU'LL BOTH BE CONDUCTING
HIS MAJESTY TO ESTABUL, CORRECT?

274
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,541
IS IT FOOLISH OF ME
TO HAVE FAITH

275
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,458
IN YOUR ABILITY TO PROTECT HIM?

276
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,916
- TRUST ME, WE'VE
HANDLED A LOT WORSE.

277
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,833
THE THING IS, THOUGH,
ISN'T PROTECTING HIM YOUR FORTE?

278
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,791
KINDA FUNNY SION WOULD
ASK FERRIS AND ME

279
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,666
TO BE HIS BODYGUARDS.

280
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,875
I MEAN, HE'S GOT YOU.

281
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,583
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU'RE
ONLY ABLE TO DO YOUR THING

282
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,958
FROM HOME BASE, SO TO SPEAK.

283
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,125
I DON'T MEAN TO PRY,

284
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,375
BUT IS THERE SOMETHING
KEEPING YOU HERE?

285
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,541
LIKE, MAYBE...

286
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,500
SOME SORT OF A BINDING-CURSE?

287
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,541
- WHAT, PRAY TELL, WOULD
SUCH A THING LOOK LIKE

288
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,750
IF ONE WERE TO
BRUSH UP AGAINST IT?

289
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,583
SUCH AN IMAGINATION YOU HAVE.

290
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,875
- YOU CAN CHALK THIS UP
TO IMAGINATION,

291
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:35,375
BUT I CAN SEE IT WITH MY
OWN EYES, OR RATHER I CAN'T.

292
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:39,208
YOUR PRESENCE DOESN'T EVEN CAST
A SHADOW ON MY ALPHA STIGMA.

293
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,416
SO JUST WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU, EXACTLY?

294
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,541
- APART FROM FERRIS'
OLDER BROTHER,

295
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,083
NO ONE OF ANY CONSEQUENCE.

296
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,000
- DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH ME,
DAMMIT, FERRIS IS A HUMAN BEING.

297
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,666
THERE'S NO WAY THE TWO
OF YOU ARE RELATED.

298
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,833
( gasps )

299
00:17:55,916 --> 00:18:00,291
WAIT... I JUST...
I WANTED TO KNOW...

300
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,625
- WHAT A KIND THING FOR YOU
TO INTIMATE ABOUT HER.

301
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:07,541
THAT SHE ISN'T THE MONSTER
HER ELDER BROTHER IS, I MEAN.

302
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:11,875
FERRIS IS INDEED HUMAN.
QUITE UNLIKE YOU OR I.

303
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:16,875
TO THAT END, I'D LIKE YOU
TO KEEP THIS IN MIND.

304
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,416
TO BE BLUNT,

305
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,166
I WILL TOLERATE ABSOLUTELY NO
ENCROACHMENT UPON MY SISTER.

306
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,875
YOUR BLOOD WILL NEVER
MINGLE WITH HERS.

307
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,583
HARBOR AMOROUS FANTASIES
AT YOUR PERIL.

308
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,458
- YOU THINK I'VE GOT
DESIGNS ON HER?

309
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,416
- COME NOW.
I'M ONLY BEING CAUTIOUS.

310
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,791
YOU'VE A TALENT FOR
IMPROBABLE DREAMS, AFTER ALL.

311
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,875
DREAMS FOR A WORLD WITHOUT WAR.

312
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,750
WHAT BASTION CAN YOU HOPE
TO ERECT AGAINST BLOODSHED,

313
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,250
WITH YOUR HANDS DYED IN
THE BLOOD OF INNOCENTS?

314
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,583
SUCH HANDS ARE USEFUL
FOR ONE THING ONLY.

315
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,708
PARADOXICAL THOUGH IT MAY SOUND,

316
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:53,125
THAT IS WHY I AM PLEASED THAT
YOU AND MY SISTER ARE PAIRED.

317
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:56,750
YOU DAREN'T TOUCH HER,
YOU DAREN'T TOUCH ANYONE.

318
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,791
NOT WHEN YOU FIND
LIFE ITSELF REPUGNANT.

319
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,541
DESPAIR NOT, RYNER LUTE.

320
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,083
- ( screaming )

321
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,500
- THIS ENCOUNTER DOES NOT
MAKE US ENEMIES.

322
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,625
GO WITH MY BLESSING AND
LOOK AFTER MY BELOVED SISTER.

323
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,666
- Milk: AH-HA! THERE YOU ARE!

324
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,791
WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU
UP TO SO LATE IN THE EVENING?

325
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,541
IS SOMETHING WRONG?
YOUR COLOR'S NOT GOOD.

326
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,708
- OH, IT'S NOTHING.
I'LL BE FINE.

327
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,750
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING
UP SO LATE?

328
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:37,625
- UH, WELL... I KIND OF... UM...

329
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,875
HERE! THE SQUAD'S HOLDING
A LITTLE BIRTHDAY GET-TOGETHER

330
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,458
FOR ME TOMORROW.

331
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,875
IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE,
I'D REALLY LIKE YOU TO BE THERE.

332
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,458
- WELL, I UH...

333
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,916
- TOMORROW MORNING I'VE
ASSIGNED THE WYNITT DANGO SHOP

334
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,708
AS OUR SECRET RENDEZVOUS POINT.

335
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,541
- LUKE'S DOING ALL THE
COOKING HIMSELF,

336
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,416
WHICH MEANS THE FOOD WILL BE
SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANNA MISS,

337
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,000
BELIEVE ME.

338
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,541
HE'S SO SWEET, HE MADE ALL THE
INVITATIONS COMPLETELY BY HAND.

339
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,958
- SO YOU'RE GONNA COME?
- HOLD ON A SECOND.

340
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,666
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY?

341
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,750
- WELL, I DON'T. AT LEAST
NOT MY REAL ONE ANYWAY.

342
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,916
SEE THE GUYS... I MEAN THE SQUAD
THOUGHT TOMORROW WAS PERFECT.

343
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,541
BECAUSE IT'S THE ANNIVERSARY
OF WHEN THE SQUAD WAS FORMED.

344
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,708
SO IT'S KIND OF BETTER
THAN MY REAL ONE!

345
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,666
AND IF YOU WERE THERE,
IT'D BE PERFECTION ITSELF.

346
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,750
- CAN'T REALLY BACK OUTTA THIS.

347
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,083
I GUESS HOLDING OFF FOR
ONE DAY WON'T BE TOO BAD.

348
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,125
I CAN APPEASE FERRIS BY
HELPING HER PLAN SION'S DEMISE.

349
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,458
THAT'S ALWAYS GOOD
FOR BUYING US A LITTLE TIME.

350
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,208
- I'M SO SORRY, CAPTAIN,
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

351
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,291
IF A TABOO BREAKER OF
HIS TYPE LOSES CONTROL,

352
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,041
IT WOULD MEAN THE END OF HIM.

353
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,666
AND I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE YOU
SUFFER THAT LOSS.

354
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,375
FORGIVE ME. THIS WAS THE ONLY
THING I COULD THINK OF

355
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,083
TO AVOID A TRAGEDY.

356
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,708
- ( chuckles excitedly )
I GAVE HIM THE INVITATION.

357
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,000
AND IF HE COMES TOMORROW,

358
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,916
IT WILL OFFICIALLY BE THE
BEST BIRTHDAY EVER.

359
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,750
- "IF THE ALPHA STIGMA BEARER,
RYNER LUTE, LOSES CONTROL,

366

I'M ONLY BEING CAUTIOUS.

367
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:50,041
YOU'VE A TALENT FOR
IMPROBABLE DREAMS, AFTER ALL.

368
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,666
- I GET IT NOW.

369
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,375
I SHOULD'VE SEEN IT.

370
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,833
I'D DO THE SAME THING
IN HIS PLACE.

- Ryner: I'VE KNOWN THIS FOR
AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER.

373
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,708
SO LONG AS I'M AROUND,
THINGS WILL ALWAYS GO TO SHIT.

374
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,125
BUT HEY, I GUESS
THAT'S LIFE, RIGHT?

375
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:52,000
TELL YOU WHAT, WHY DON'T YOU
PEOPLE LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE?
