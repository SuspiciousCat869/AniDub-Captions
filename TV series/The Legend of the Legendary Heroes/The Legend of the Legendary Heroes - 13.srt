1
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:24,375
( students chattering )

2
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:31,333
- Student 1: WHAT CLASS
IS SHE IN?

3
01:00:31,416 --> 01:00:32,750
- Student 2: SHE IS CUTE!

4
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:35,083
- Student 3: YEAH, BUT SHE LOOKS
KIND OF INTIMIDATING.

5
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:37,208
- ( yawing )

6
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:38,625
WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?

7
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:41,666
- UH, MY BAD. SORRY.

8
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:43,375
- HEY, IF YOU DON'T WATCH
WHERE YOU'RE GOING,

9
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:45,041
SOMEBODY'S GONNA
GET HURT, BUDDY.

10
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:50,458
- ( theme song playing )

11
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:21,208
- Instructor: All right! Begin!

12
01:02:23,875 --> 01:02:27,250
- ( yawns )

13
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:28,750
- WHAT IS THIS?

14
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:31,375
ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE ME LOWER
MY GUARD? TAKE THIS, THEN!

15
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,791
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
ARE YOU OKAY?

16
01:02:35,875 --> 01:02:37,291
- ( Ryner snores )

17
01:02:42,791 --> 01:02:43,916
- Student 4: LET'S GO.

18
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,958
- RYNER! WAKE UP ALREADY,
WE'RE MOVING!

19
01:02:48,041 --> 01:02:49,750
- Student 4: OL' RYNER'S
SLEEPING AGAIN.

20
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:53,333
- Student 5: HE'S HOPELESS,
KIEFER, JUST LEAVE HIM BE!

21
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:55,791
- DOESN'T THE OPINION OF YOUR
CLASSMATES MEAN ANYTHING?

22
01:02:55,875 --> 01:02:59,083
- NOT AS MUCH AS BEING FORCED
TO ATTEND TRAINING CLASS TODAY

23
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:00,083
BECAUSE OF ONE OF 'EM.

24
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:01,708
- OH, BOY.

25
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,666
WHAT AM I DOING?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

26
01:03:18,666 --> 01:03:20,083
- ( exclaims ) I WANT THAT ONE!

27
01:03:20,166 --> 01:03:22,875
- JUST DON'T WASTE MONEY, OKAY?
- RIGHT!

28
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:26,000
- SO, KIEFER, DO YOU SEE
ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE?

29
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:28,041
YOU ARE A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD
GIRL, YOU KNOW,

30
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:29,583
IT'S OKAY FOR YOU
TO WANT THINGS.

31
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:31,666
DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF.

32
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,291
- WELL, IT'S JUST...

33
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,333
I DON'T KNOW.

34
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:37,625
- LOOK! I GOT SOME FOR YOU, TOO!

35
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:41,000
TAKE ONE.

36
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:43,375
SEE? THEY'RE PRETTY,
AREN'T THEY?

37
01:03:43,458 --> 01:03:44,666
- THAT WAS SWEET.

38
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:52,041
- I WOULDN'T BE LAUGHING
IF I WERE YOU, GIRL.

39
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:54,125
WE DON'T FIND
ESPIONAGE TO BE HUMOROUS.

40
01:03:54,208 --> 01:03:56,083
- KIEFER! TAKE LEMILE
AND GO NOW!

41
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,125
- RIGHT!

42
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,333
- WHAT I SEEK IS
THUNDER! IZUCHI!

43
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:14,416
- HURRY! GET OUT OF HERE, NOW!

44
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,416
I OFFER UP THIS CONTRACT TO BEAR
THE WICKED SPIRIT BEAST

45
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,250
THAT SLEEPS WITHIN THE EARTH!

46
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,791
- IS NAIA GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

47
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:41,583
SHOULD WE GO BACK AND GET HER?

48
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:42,791
- SHE'LL BE JUST FINE.

49
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:44,916
WE'LL MEET UP WITH HER
AT THE BORDER, OKAY?

50
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,875
- ( laughs )

51
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:51,666
OH, NOT TO WORRY, LITTLE ONE.
YOUR SISTER IS ALREADY HERE.

52
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:55,958
SHE SAID SHE'D DO ANYTHING
TO SAVE YOU,

53
01:04:56,041 --> 01:04:58,000
EVEN IF IT COST HER LIFE.

54
01:05:01,708 --> 01:05:04,916
I GUESS SHE WASN'T KIDDING
AROUND AFTER ALL, WAS SHE NOW?

55
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:08,791
- ( sobbing )

56
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:11,791
- BASTARD!

57
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,833
I WILL END YOU!

58
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,250
- I LOVE IT!

59
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:16,875
( laughing )

60
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:18,041
- SISTER!

61
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,916
PLEASE LET HER GO,
YOU'RE GONNA KILL HER!

62
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,666
JUST STOP IT!

63
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:26,833
- SHUT UP!

64
01:05:26,916 --> 01:05:30,166
- NO, DON'T!
I CAN'T BREATHE, PLEASE.

65
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,708
- ( sobs ) PLEASE STOP.
NOT MY SISTER.

66
01:05:39,708 --> 01:05:42,375
LET HER GO.
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU SAY.

67
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:46,458
- AH, IS THAT SO?

68
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:49,291
EVEN IF THAT PLEDGE MEANS
FORSAKING THE SOIL OF YOUR

69
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:51,291
NATIVE LAND AND
TURNING ON YOUR FRIENDS?

70
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:59,458
- I LOVE THE WAY THIS FEELS.

71
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,125
CARING ABOUT SOMEONE SO MUCH.

72
01:06:06,916 --> 01:06:10,583
BUT I HAVE NO RIGHT...
NO RIGHT TO THINK SUCH THINGS.

73
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:15,458
BECAUSE IN THE END,
I MUST BETRAY HIM.

74
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:21,500
I HATE THIS. I DON'T WANT
TO KILL ANYONE ELSE.

75
01:06:23,166 --> 01:06:25,166
PLEASE, RYNER, HELP ME.

76
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:33,333
- OH, WOW,
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

77
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:38,833
- I BET,
YOU DO ENJOY YOUR NAPS.

78
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:47,541
- I'M TIRED.

79
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:50,666
- SLEEPING WHILE AT THE REIGNS
IS FORBIDDEN!

80
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:53,125
- OH, COME ON,
CUT ME SOME SLACK, WILL YA?

81
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:54,625
I HAVEN'T SLEPT A WINK!

82
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:57,208
- OUR FRIEND. IT SEEMS HE'S
SLEEPING FOR THE BOTH OF US.

83
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:06,916
- PRIVATE KIEFER KNOLLES!

84
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:12,083
GET OUT OF HERE!
THIS WHOLE PLACE IS DONE FOR!

85
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:13,333
- YES, BUT, CAPTAIN,

86
01:07:13,416 --> 01:07:15,250
THERE ARE STILL SO MANY
INNOCENT PEOPLE HERE!

87
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:16,666
- JUST FORGET ABOUT THEM.

88
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:19,375
THE ENTIRE GASTARK ARMY
IS ON ITS WAY!

89
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:29,708
- STOHL'S BY FAR THE STRONGEST,
BEST ORGANIZED MILITARY FORCE

90
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:30,875
ON MENORIS.

91
01:07:30,958 --> 01:07:32,541
IT'S ODD THAT THEY DIDN'T
DO MORE RESEARCH

92
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:34,250
ON RYNER'S ALPHA STIGMA.

93
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:57,541
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- THANK YOU.

94
01:08:05,083 --> 01:08:06,500
- NO WAY AM I GONNA DIE HERE,

95
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,166
NOT WHILE I STILL HAVE
BREATH IN ME!

96
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,333
NOW, I OFFER UP THIS CONTRACT

97
01:08:11,416 --> 01:08:12,791
TO UNLEASH THE BEAST OF LIGHT

98
01:08:12,875 --> 01:08:14,875
THAT DANCES THROUGH
THE NIGHT SKY!

99
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,250
NO WAY!
MY MAGIC DIDN'T WORK!

100
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:24,083
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

101
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:34,916
- Lefahl: A STOHL SOLDIER, HUH?

102
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:45,458
WHAT, DO YOU HAVE A DEATH WISH?
STOHL ABANDONED THIS VILLAGE.

103
01:08:45,541 --> 01:08:47,541
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
ACCOMPLISH ON YOUR OWN?

104
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,750
- LOOK, YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ME!

105
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:52,916
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO
ABANDON THEM!

106
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,291
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?

107
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:57,125
A SOLDIER WITH A BLEEDING HEART,
THAT'S A NEW ONE.

108
01:08:57,208 --> 01:08:59,125
- WHAT, SHOULD I REJOICE IN WAR?

109
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:01,958
WHEN ALL IT BRINGS IS DEATH,
DESTRUCTION AND PAIN!

110
01:09:02,041 --> 01:09:03,583
- ( Lefahl laughs )

111
01:09:03,666 --> 01:09:05,916
YOU'RE KEEPING ME TALKING SO
YOU CAN WAIT FOR A CHANCE

112
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,416
TO DISH OUT A LITTLE PAIN OF
YOUR OWN, AREN'T YOU, GIRL?

113
01:09:09,833 --> 01:09:12,833
THAT MAGIC YOU USED ISN'T NATIVE
TO STOHL, THOUGH.

114
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:14,125
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE
PUTTING YOURSELF

115
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:16,000
BETWEEN THEM AND GASTARK,

116
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:18,583
RISKING YOUR OWN NECK TO SAVE
THE LIVES OF FOREIGNERS

117
01:09:18,666 --> 01:09:20,250
WHO CARE NOTHING FOR YOU.

118
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:25,416
SOUNDS LIKE A
BLEEDING HEART TO ME.

119
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,333
HOWEVER, LUCKY FOR YOU I FIND
THAT SORT OF THING ENDEARING.

120
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,833
- PREPARATIONS ARE ALL IN ORDER,
MY KING.

121
01:09:33,916 --> 01:09:37,125
- AND THE SECURING OF CIVILIANS?
- HAS BEEN COMPLETED.

122
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:40,083
A MASS INVOCATION FROM STOHL
FORCES IS ALMOST FINISHED.

123
01:09:40,166 --> 01:09:42,125
WE MUST WITHDRAW, YOUR MAJESTY.

124
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:43,458
- YOUR MAJESTY?

125
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:45,083
SO HE'S...

126
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:49,750
- SIR! PLEASE!

127
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:04,750
- MY HEART IS AKIN TO YOURS.
IT HUNGERS FOR PEACE.

128
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:08,125
BLOODSHED, TEARS
AND MISERY, I ABHOR.

129
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:10,625
I ABHOR THE DEATH
OF A FELLOW SOLDIER.

130
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:12,083
I ABHOR THE
DEATH OF A CHILD.

131
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,958
AND IF A SWEET, KINDRED SOUL
LIKE YOURS WERE TO DIE,

132
01:10:15,041 --> 01:10:17,791
ABHORRENCE WOULD BE
ALL THAT REMAINED OF ME.

133
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:20,000
BUT AS LONG AS NATIONS EXIST,

134
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:22,833
WARS WILL BE WAGED,
MEN WILL PERISH.

135
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:26,333
I SUFFER GREAT PAINS TO DIMINISH
CASUALTIES AS MUCH AS I CAN,

136
01:10:26,416 --> 01:10:28,958
TO SOFTEN THE EDGES
OF THE WORLD.

137
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:31,833
NOT JUST FOR GASTARK,
BUT STOHL, TOO.

138
01:10:31,916 --> 01:10:35,041
INDEED FOR EVERY SOUL
THAT CALLS MENORIS ITS HOME.

139
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:37,750
TO SAVE THEM ALL
AND TO ELIMINATE WAR,

140
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,291
THAT IS MY DREAM.

141
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:43,750
- ONE CANNOT PLEDGE TO ELIMINATE
WAR BY SEEKING TO WAGE IT.

142
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:47,166
YOU'RE A HYPOCRITE!

143
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:49,666
- YES, I SUPPOSE I AM.

144
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:51,250
WHAT CAN ONE MAN DO?

145
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,041
THERE'S ALWAYS THIS!

146
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:08,750
- Spectral Female Voice:
CONTRACTOR, I HEAR THEE

147
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:10,333
AND ANSWER THY CALL.

148
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,250
COME, OFFER THY COMPENSATION,

149
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:17,208
AND IN DOING SO
UNLEASH MY STRENGTH.

150
01:11:17,291 --> 01:11:19,791
- I HEREBY OFFER YOU
MY LEFT EYE!

151
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:21,208
I NEED YOUR POWER!

152
01:11:23,666 --> 01:11:25,916
- Spectral Female Voice:
THE CONTRACT IS SOLIDIFIED.

153
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,333
- NOW GIVE ME YOUR STRENGTH.

154
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:35,708
HEAR ME, GLOUVIL!
I UNLEASH YOU!

155
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,666
I WILL NOT LET THIS SACRIFICE
BE IN VAIN.

156
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:43,166
I BRING DESTRUCTION TO ALL!

157
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:45,416
I BRING CHANGE!

158
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:47,916
COME NOW!

159
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:51,916
AND SEND THESE BASTARDS TO HELL!

160
01:12:15,708 --> 01:12:16,666
( Lefahl yells )

161
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,166
( screams )

162
01:12:24,458 --> 01:12:25,583
- YOUR MAJESTY!

163
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:29,791
- Lefahl: LEAVE ME BE.
AND TELL STOHL:

164
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:32,125
UNLESS THEY WOULD SEE
ANOTHER SUCH ATTACK,

165
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:35,833
THEY WILL SURRENDER.

166
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:39,041
- YOUR EYE, IT...
- IT'S MY SACRIFICE.

167
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:41,958
FOR USING THE
SACRED SWORD, GLOUVIL.

168
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:44,916
- HIS MAJESTY HAS ALREADY
MADE MANY SACRIFICES.

169
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,625
HIS SENSE OF SMELL,
HIS RIGHT LEG.

170
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:49,250
- THAT'S AWFUL.

171
01:12:50,958 --> 01:12:55,583
- IT'S NOT. I ENDED A
STAGGERING NUMBER OF LIVES, YES.

172
01:12:55,666 --> 01:12:59,000
BUT BY DOING SO,
SPARED COUNTLESS MORE.

173
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:03,000
A SMALL PRICE TO PAY.
A SACRIFICE WELL WORTH IT.

174
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:04,208
TO SAVE LIVES.

175
01:13:05,875 --> 01:13:07,625
- YOU REALLY DON'T REGRET IT?

176
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:14,333
- I'D BE A MONSTER IF I DIDN'T
DESPAIR OF KILLING WHEN I MUST.

177
01:13:14,416 --> 01:13:18,416
IF YOU TRULY DO DESIRE PEACE
AND WISH TO SAVE LIVES,

178
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,333
STAND BY MY SIDE.

179
01:13:20,416 --> 01:13:24,083
MY NAME'S LEFAHL EDEA.
THE GREAT HERO KING OF GASTARK.

180
01:13:29,208 --> 01:13:32,833
- NOT JUST YET.
BUT SOMEDAY, YOUR MAJESTY,

181
01:13:32,916 --> 01:13:35,125
I WILL STAND PROUDLY
BY YOUR SIDE.

182
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:41,750
- SOMEDAY, YOU SAY?
AH, WELL, SEE YOU THEN.

183
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,875
- GOODBYE, KING OF GASTARK.

184
01:13:45,958 --> 01:13:47,791
KEEP ON TRYING
TO SAVE THE WORLD.

185
01:13:56,541 --> 01:13:58,666
- Lord 1: SO D'YOU HEAR
ABOUT THE RECENT PURGE?

186
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:01,083
FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD,
LIEUTENANT FROAUDE IS BEHIND IT.

187
01:14:01,166 --> 01:14:02,500
- Lord 2: IMPOSSIBLE!

188
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:04,958
YOU'RE SAYING HE RAISED A HAND
AGAINST HIS OWN FATHER?

189
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,500
- HOW LONG DO YOU PLAN TO
KEEP ME ON AS A FIELD MARSHAL?

190
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:11,416
- FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES.

191
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,125
- I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS!

192
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:14,375
AND I DON'T WANT IT, SIR.

193
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:16,333
I'M BEGGING YOU,
DEMOTE ME, PLEASE!

194
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:18,083
- WHY WOULD WE DEMOTE YOU?

195
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:20,000
A MORE APPROPRIATE PERSON
THERE IS NOT.

196
01:14:20,083 --> 01:14:22,208
- I SEE.
YOU'RE MAKING SPORT OF ME.

197
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,250
- NO. I SPEAK TRUE.

198
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:25,708
- IS THAT SO?

199
01:14:25,791 --> 01:14:27,666
WHY DOES THAT MAKE IT
MORE UNBEARABLE?

200
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:29,541
- YOUR SIMPLE MIND
DOESN'T COMPREHEND

201
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:32,708
THE SUBTLE WENDING
OF MORAL AMBIGUITY.

202
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:35,291
IN THAT SIMPLE MIND DWELLS
YOUR MILITARY GENIUS.

203
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:37,083
IT ENGENDERS LOYALTY
FROM THE MEN,

204
01:14:37,166 --> 01:14:39,041
WHO ADMIRE YOU FOR
YOUR STEADFAST 'MORALS.'

205
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:40,708
- BASTARD! YOU MOCK ME!

206
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:42,416
- Sion: ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH!

207
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:45,166
WE MUSN'T FORGET, WE ARE ALL
ON THE SAME SIDE, YES?

208
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:49,125
FIELD MARSHAL KLOM,

209
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:51,500
I'D LIKE YOU TO PAY
A VISIT TO ESTABUL.

210
01:14:51,583 --> 01:14:53,416
- ESTABUL, SIR?

211
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,041
- THE ESTABULIAN FORCES
MUST BE REFORMED

212
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:56,541
AND CONJOINED
WITH THE ROLAND ARMY.

213
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:58,250
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!

214
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:00,208
THE MAJORITY OF ESTABUL'S
SOLDIERS AND CITIZENS

215
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:03,041
FEEL RESENTMENT FOR ROLAND
AND FOR YOU, YOUR MAJESTY!

216
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:04,958
WE CAN'T FORCE THEM
TO JOIN WITH US,

217
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:06,916
IT WILL ONLY
MAKE THINGS WORSE.

218
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,458
- NO. TIDES ARE TURNING
FOR ROLAND.

219
01:15:09,541 --> 01:15:12,250
GAINING ALLEGIANCE FROM
THE ESTABULIAN MILITARY,

220
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:14,875
THIS MUST BE OUR PRIORITY.

221
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:18,458
GIVEN LADY NOA'S REPUTATION AS
A BEACON OF HOPE FOR HER PEOPLE,

222
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:21,000
AND YOUR OWN AS HER
CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND,

223
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:22,625
YOU ARE THAT
PRIORITY'S WARHORSE.

224
01:15:22,708 --> 01:15:25,458
- YOU'RE SUGGESTING I TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF A WOMAN I ADMIRE?

225
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:27,000
- YES.

226
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:28,375
- WELL, YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT IT!

227
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:30,083
- IT IS NECESSARY
FOR THIS NATION.

228
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:34,791
- THE NATION OF WHICH
YOUR HIGHNESS SPEAKS.

229
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:37,833
TELL ME THIS. DOES IT INCLUDE
THE INNOCENT WOMEN AND CHILDREN

230
01:15:37,916 --> 01:15:40,208
OF ESTABUL, TOO?

231
01:15:40,291 --> 01:15:42,000
- YES, OF COURSE.

232
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:44,958
EVERY ONE OF YOU.
YOU'RE ALL MY VALUABLE CITIZENS.

233
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,833
THERE IS NO DECEIT
IN MY PLANS FOR ESTABUL.

234
01:15:47,916 --> 01:15:50,916
I WISH TO FORGE PEACE, AND
CROSS SWORDS WITH THEM NO MORE.

235
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:56,875
I ONCE HAD A FRIEND,

236
01:15:56,958 --> 01:15:59,375
A DEAR COMPANION NAMED
KIEFER KNOLLES.

237
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:02,750
I ADORED HER.

238
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:06,000
BUT SHE BETRAYED US
AS AN ESTABULIAN SPY.

239
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:08,416
A GOOD MAJORITY OF
MY FRIENDS WERE KILLED.

240
01:16:10,458 --> 01:16:14,166
- SIRE, DO YOU MEAN TO INTIMATE
THAT YOU RESENT ESTABUL?

241
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:16,250
- I DON'T.

242
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:20,750
EVEN NOW, DEEP IN MY HEART,
I CONSIDER KIEFER A DEAR FRIEND.

243
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:23,666
YOU SEE,
SHE HAD NO ALTERNATIVE.

244
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:26,750
ONE SISTER WAS KILLED BY ROLAND,
ANOTHER TAKEN HOSTAGE,

245
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:29,166
SHE WAS FORCED
TO BECOME A DOUBLE AGENT.

246
01:16:31,958 --> 01:16:36,750
BUT STILL, HER FACE NEVER ONCE
BETRAYED HER TRUE INTENT.

247
01:16:36,833 --> 01:16:38,708
UNDOUBTEDLY, OF COURSE,

248
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:41,958
HER HEART MUST'VE WRITHED
IN TORMENT ALL THE WHILE.

249
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:47,166
BUT FOR MY LIFE
I NEVER KNEW...

250
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:49,166
AS LONG AS I RULE THIS LAND,

251
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:52,791
THERE WILL BE NO MORE WAR
BETWEEN ROLAND AND ESTABUL.

252
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:54,500
SO, FRIENDS.

253
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:56,333
I REQUIRE YOUR ASSISTANCE.

254
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:00,958
- AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT.

255
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:03,958
AS LONG AS IT IS WITHIN MY
POWER, I SHALL DO ANYTHING.

256
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:11,375
- YOU'LL USE LADY NOA'S
INFLUENCE TO REVITALIZE

257
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:14,166
THE ESTABULIAN FORCES
AND STRENGTHEN ROLAND.

258
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,333
AT THE SAME TIME, YOU'LL
ENGENDER LOYALTY

259
01:17:16,416 --> 01:17:18,250
BY HONORING THEIR
MILITARY PERSONNEL.

260
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:19,458
IT'S BRILLIANT.

261
01:17:19,541 --> 01:17:21,916
- LET US ALL HOPE IT HAS
THE DESIRED EFFECT.

262
01:17:23,875 --> 01:17:25,500
- I SHALL TAKE MY LEAVE.

263
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:27,333
I WILL BE HEADING
FOR THE RUNA EMPIRE.

264
01:17:27,416 --> 01:17:28,833
- RUNA?

265
01:17:28,916 --> 01:17:30,375
- IT SEEMS DUKE STEARIED,

266
01:17:30,458 --> 01:17:32,708
THE RINGLEADER BEHIND THE PLOT
TO ASSASSINATE YOUR GRACE,

267
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:34,833
WAS IN TALKS WITH RUNA NOBILITY.

268
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:37,416
I AM GOING TO ASCERTAIN
THE FACTS.

269
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,458
- BE CAREFUL, PLEASE.
YOU ARE OF NO USE TO ME DEAD.

270
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,500
- THY WILL BE DONE.

271
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:51,541
- Ryner: AW, MAN...

272
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,958
RESCUING KUKU'S
GOING TO BE A PAIN, ISN'T IT?

273
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:57,208
- THINK OF IT THIS WAY.

274
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:58,958
IF WE DO NOTHING, WHAT THEN
BECOMES OF OUR DREAM

275
01:17:59,041 --> 01:17:59,958
TO HOLD CELEBRATORY TEA?

276
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:01,958
COME NOW,
LET'S DO THIS FOR KUKU!

277
01:18:02,041 --> 01:18:03,541
- HEY, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

278
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:06,375
WHY DO YOUR DREAMS BECOME
MY DREAMS BY EXTENSION?

279
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:09,208
JUST KIDDING, LET'S MAKE
ALL OUR DREAMS COME TRUE, HUH?

280
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:16,333
- WHAT'S WRONG?

281
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:25,625
- THIS DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT,
THERE'S NOBODY INSIDE THERE.

282
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:28,041
- YEAH, I DON'T SENSE
ANY PRESENCE.

283
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,625
- DAMN. THE BOTH OF YOU!

284
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,000
- Ryner: WELL, THIS SUCKS.

285
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:55,125
- Sui: IF IT ISN'T OUR DEAR
FRIENDS, RYNER AND FERRIS.

286
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:57,583
WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE
RUNNING INTO YOU AGAIN.

287
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:58,916
- WERE YOU WAITING FOR US?

288
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,500
- YES. WE ARE BOTH
EXTREMELY INTERESTED IN YOU.

289
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:04,958
YOU OWN A UNIQUE ALPHA STIGMA,
AFTER ALL.

290
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:08,333
AN ENORMOUS POWER, INCOMPARABLE
TO ALL OTHER BEARERS.

291
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:09,583
YOU ARE ONE LUCKY FELLOW.

292
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:12,791
EVEN MY OWN RULE FRAGMENT,
THE ELEMIO COMB,

293
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:14,833
WAS ESSENTIALLY RENDERED
USELESS UP AGAINST YOU.

294
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:16,291
AND ON TOP OF THAT,

295
01:19:16,375 --> 01:19:18,375
EVEN AFTER AWAKENING
AND LOSING CONTROL,

296
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:20,666
YOU HAVE RETURNED TO NORMAL.

297
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:24,166
BEGGING THE QUESTION:
WHO ARE YOU?

298
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:26,791
- IF I KNEW THAT,
I WOULDN'T BE HERE.

299
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:29,375
- THAT LITTLE CHILD YOU TWO
MANAGED TO SECURE,

300
01:19:29,458 --> 01:19:31,375
HE BEARS THE
ALPHA STIGMA, AS WELL.

301
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:33,000
WHERE HAVE YOU HIDDEN HIM?

302
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:35,083
- HOLD ON,
YOU KNOW ABOUT ARUA?

303
01:19:35,166 --> 01:19:37,166
- WHY, YES, OF COURSE.

304
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:40,250
YOU SEE, RYNER, WE'RE
INTERESTED IN THE ALPHA STIGMA,

305
01:19:40,333 --> 01:19:41,833
NO MATTER WHAT FORM IT TAKES.

306
01:19:41,916 --> 01:19:42,875
- KUU...

307
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:48,750
- I OFFER UP THIS CONTRACT
TO BEAR THE WICKED SPIRIT BEAST

308
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:50,375
THAT SLEEPS WITHIN THE EARTH!

309
01:19:54,375 --> 01:19:56,458
- THERE'S NO ESCAPING KUU,
MY FRIEND!

310
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:17,708
- Ryner: NOT GOOD.

311
01:20:17,791 --> 01:20:19,416
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S SPLIT UP!

312
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,041
LEAVE THIS TO ME AND
GO TAKE CARE OF ARUA!

313
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:22,083
- RIGHT!

314
01:20:24,166 --> 01:20:25,916
- OH, YES! RYNER!

315
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,791
BEFORE WE PART WAYS,
ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

316
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:31,458
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND KUKU,

317
01:20:31,541 --> 01:20:33,125
SHE IS BEING CONFINED
IN THE MANOR

318
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:35,083
OF A NOBLE
OF THIS TERRITORY.

319
01:20:35,166 --> 01:20:37,291
WE'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU THERE.

320
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:39,333
- I WILL MAKE YOU REGRET THIS.

321
01:20:43,166 --> 01:20:44,125
- Miran: TELL ME,

322
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:46,791
WHY IS THE KING OF RUNA
NOT PRESENT?

323
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,916
- MY FATHER, OR RATHER,
THE KING IS VERY ILL.

324
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,250
I'M SORRY.
HE IS UNABLE TO ATTEND YOU.

325
01:20:53,333 --> 01:20:55,416
- Miran: OH, IS THAT RIGHT?

326
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:59,000
PARDON MY INTRUSIVENESS,
PRINCESS, WHERE DID HE GO?

327
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:02,541
CASSALA? OR IMPERIAL NELPHA?

328
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:06,125
- WELL, I'M AFRAID
IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO SAY.

329
01:21:06,208 --> 01:21:09,791
- AGAIN, I BEG YOUR PARDON.
IN POLITICS, WOMEN ARE NEUTRAL.

330
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:12,583
SUCH IS BRED THE MIND OF A LADY
BORN TO THIS COUNTRY.

331
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:14,833
FORGIVE ME. IN THE FACE
OF SUCH BEAUTY

332
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:17,958
I SIMPLY FORGOT
MY STANDING, YOUR HIGHNESS.

333
01:21:22,166 --> 01:21:24,125
YES, I SEE.

334
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:26,125
IT IS THE KING OF RUNA.

335
01:21:26,208 --> 01:21:28,375
IT SEEMS HE HAS BETRAYED
HIS ALLIANCE WITH ROLAND.

336
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:31,916
HE'S JOINED HANDS WITH GASTARK.
A FOOLISH PLAN.

337
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,916
YES, THAT DOES EXPLAIN
WHY HE WAS UNABLE

338
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,166
TO MEET WITH ME TODAY.

339
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:38,000
FURTHERMORE,

340
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:39,083
THE KING OF RUNA WAS THE PERSON

341
01:21:39,166 --> 01:21:41,625
WHO ORCHESTRATED
THE ASSASSINATION PLOT.

342
01:21:41,708 --> 01:21:43,166
HE WAS BEHIND IT ALL.

343
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:45,916
- I'VE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING!
SPARE ME!

344
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,916
THESE MONSTERS!
PLEASE GET RID OF THEM!

345
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:01,083
- GASTARK MESSENGERS.

346
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:04,000
THEY SLAUGHTERED ALL
THE RUNA SOLDIERS IN AN INSTANT.

347
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:07,833
I CAN'T LET THIS GO
UNCHALLENGED, CAN I?

348
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:10,250
I SUPPOSE I'LL HAVE TO
DISPOSE OF THEM, TOO.

349
01:22:12,333 --> 01:22:14,375
- ( theme song playing )

350
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,833
- Ryner: MAN, WHY IS IT ALWAYS
ONE CRAPPY THING AFTER ANOTHER?

351
01:23:45,916 --> 01:23:47,083
WHAT DID I SAY?

352
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:49,208
ALL YOU NORTHERN PEOPLE,
JUST STAY WHERE YOU ARE!

353
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:51,375
THIS SUCKS AND I DON'T WANNA
DEAL WITH IT ANYMORE!

354
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:53,000
THIS WHOLE REVENGE THING,
IT'S JUST...

355
01:23:53,083 --> 01:23:56,208
IT'S JUST...
IT'S NOT ME! YOU KNOW?
