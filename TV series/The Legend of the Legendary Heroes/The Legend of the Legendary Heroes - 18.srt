1
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:23,000
- Ryner: MOM? DAD?

2
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:26,125
I CAN'T GO TO SLEEP BY MYSELF.
I'M TOO SCARED.

3
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:32,958
CAN YOU HEAR ME? I NEED YOU
TO READ ME ANOTHER STORY.

4
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,458
MOMMY, WHERE ARE YOU?

5
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:41,625
- I HAVE TO KILL HIM. THEN I'LL
FOLLOW HIM INTO THE DARKNESS.

6
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,708
- YOU ARE NOT THE ONE
TO DO IT, MY LOVE.

7
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,583
- WHO ELSE, THEN?
THIS IS MY FAULT.

8
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,875
COMMON WENCHES WHO FALL
IN LOVE WITH NOBLEMEN

9
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,458
PAY OUT THEIR
INDISCRETION IN BLOOD.

10
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,416
- IT'S THE ONLY WAY.
- LISTEN TO YOURSELF!

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,291
WHAT NEED HAVE WE TO WEIGH THE
WORLD'S SCORN? THIS IS LOVE.

12
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,666
PLEASE. GIVE ME THE BLADE.

13
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,083
- THE WORLD WILL HEAP MORE
THAN SCORN UPON US

14
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,583
FOR BRINGING AN ALPHA
STIGMA INTO IT.

15
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,166
HE'LL LOSE HIMSELF ONE DAY.
I KNOW HE WILL.

16
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,833
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS...

17
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,583
( crying )

18
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:23,583
- I'M SORRY, CHILD. WE
DIDN'T MEAN TO WAKE YOU. COME.

19
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:29,458
OUR SON WILL LIVE.
AS WILL YOU, MY LOVE.

20
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:32,583
I'LL SHIELD YOU BOTH FROM
HARM, COME WHAT MAY.

21
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:36,583
WE ARE A FAMILY,
AND A FAMILY WE WILL REMAIN.

22
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,916
- MOM? DAD?

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,125
- Alpha Stigma:
ANALYZE EXISTENCE.

24
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,333
SHATTER.

25
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,250
ERASE.

26
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,166
DESTROY

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,125
- NO! NOT AGAIN!
SOMEONE MAKE IT STOP!

28
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,333
- Alpha Stigma: DESTROY.

29
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,458
- I'M SCARED!

30
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,458
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!
HELP ME, PLEASE!

31
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:03,875
- ( evil laughter )

32
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,833
- MOM? DAD?

33
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,666
YOU HEARD ME.

34
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:12,708
MOM?

35
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,500
- Sion: RYNER.

36
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,958
- OH MAN. HEY YOU GUYS.
AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU HERE.

37
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:31,041
- NO, NOT AGAIN.
DAMN IT, I HATE THIS!

38
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,250
( groaning in pain )

39
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,708
( gasping )

40
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,125
YEAH. AWESOME.
THANKS FOR THAT.

41
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,000
GREAT WAY TO START THE DAY.

42
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,875
JUST WHEN I THINK MY DREAMS
CAN'T BE ANY MORE SCREWED UP.

43
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,791
I START DREAMING THAT
MY PARENTS WANTED ME.

44
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,875
- Lucile: COME NOW.
I'M ONLY BEING CAUTIOUS.

45
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:02,083
YOU'VE A TALENT FOR
IMPROBABLE DREAMS, AFTER ALL.

46
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,125
DREAMS FOR A WORLD
WITHOUT WAR?

47
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,916
WHAT BASTION CAN YOU HOPE
TO ERECT AGAINST BLOODSHED,

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,500
WITH YOUR HANDS DYED IN
THE BLOOD OF INNOCENTS?

49
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,125
SUCH HANDS ARE USEFUL
FOR ONE THING ONLY.

50
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,458
- "IF THE ALPHA STIGMA BEARER
RYNER LUTE LOSES CONTROL,

51
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,458
"OR SHOWS SIGNS OF LOSING
CONTROL, OR BEHAVES IN A MANNER

52
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,583
CONSISTENT WITH AN ACT
OF TREASON AGAINST ROLAND

53
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:25,458
WHILE TRAVELING ABROAD,
HE IS TO BE EXECUTED."

54
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,583
CAN'T ACT LIKE I'M SURPRISED.
MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO DO RIGHT

55
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,416
BY SION AND FERRIS, I CAN'T
DO IT STANDING BESIDE THEM.

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,625
AND HONESTLY, I'VE KNOWN
THAT FROM THE START.

57
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,125
- ( theme song playing )

58
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,166
- YOUR MAJESTY! I BRING NEWS.

59
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,875
FIELD MARSHAL KLOM HAS BEEN
DEFEATED BY THE ALPHA STIGMA!

60
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,416
- DEFEATED?
DON'T TELL ME HE'S...

61
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,083
- HE'S ALIVE, SIR. BUT
ACCORDING TO MY SOURCES,

62
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,958
HE'S SERIOUSLY HURT.

63
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,666
- WHERE IS HE CONVALESCING?
- PREPARE AN ESCORT AT ONCE.

64
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,000
- Soldiers: YES SIR.
- YOUR MAJESTY.

65
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,166
- ( panting )

66
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,625
MY APOLOGIES FOR BEING LATE,
MAJOR GENERAL CALNE.

67
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,208
I ASSUME THE MESSAGE
I RECEIVED CAME FROM YOU?

68
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,458
- IF YOU'RE CORPORAL LEAR
LINKAL, THE ANSWER IS YES.

69
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,041
- SIR.

70
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,916
- I'M ESLINA FOLCALT, THE MAJOR
GENERAL'S PERSONAL SECRETARY.

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,208
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

72
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,791
- IF I'M NOT STEPPING
OUT OF LINE, SIR,

73
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,000
I'D VERY MUCH LIKE TO
ASK YOU A QUESTION.

74
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,625
- BY ALL MEANS, ASK.

75
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,541
- SERGEANT LUKE STOCK-KART

76
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,125
AND JUNIOR GRADE
LIEUTENANT MILK CALLAUD

77
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,666
OF ROLAND'S TABOO
BREAKER SQUADRON

78
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,000
HAVE BOTH BEEN MISSING
SINCE YESTERDAY.

79
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,083
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR
DISAPPEARANCE SUGGEST

80
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,916
THE INVOLVEMENT OF
SOMEONE PRETTY HIGH UP

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,166
AND I WAS HOPING YOU
COULD SHED SOME LIGHT

82
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,291
ON THE SITUATION FOR US.

83
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,291
- NO. I'M AFRAID THIS IS THE
FIRST INKLING I'VE HEARD OF IT.

84
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,291
BUT ON THAT NOTE,

85
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:21,458
STRANGE DISAPPEARANCES DO SEEM
TO BE ALL THE RAGE THESE DAYS.

86
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,958
AS A MATTER OF FACT, RYNER LUTE,

87
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:26,375
THE ONE YOU LOT WERE PURSUING
HAS GONE MISSING AS WELL.

88
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,250
MY WHOLE POINT IN
ARRANGING THIS MEETING

89
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,250
WAS IN THE HOPE THAT YOU'D
BE ABLE TO SHED SOME LIGHT

90
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,541
ON THAT FOR ME.

91
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,000
- THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL
CONFIRMED SIGHTINGS

92
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,250
OF HIM EN ROUTE

93
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,041
TO THE FORMER ESTABULIAN
TERRITORIES ON HIS OWN.

94
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,541
- NOT A BAD START. AT THIS POINT

95
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,208
I WELCOME ANYTHING WE CAN USE
TO TIGHTEN THE NET A BIT.

96
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,875
MY SINCERE THANKS, CORPORAL.

97
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,500
- ESLINA, PLEASE INFORM
LADY FERRIS THAT WE HAVE A LEAD.

98
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,750
- RIGHT.

99
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,666
- NOT TO SOUND OMINOUS,
BUT SOMETHING TELLS ME

100
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,583
THEIR DISAPPEARANCES AREN'T
JUST COINCIDENTAL.

101
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,125
THE SOONER WE CAN GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF THIS, THE BETTER.

102
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,708
- BIG SISTER FERRIS!
I BROUGHT YOU A SURPRISE,

103
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,000
EVEN THOUGH I'M PRETTY
SURE YOU CAN GUESS

104
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,750
WHAT IT IS FROM THE SMELL!

105
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,500
FRESH FROM THE
WYNITT DANGO SHOP,

106
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:10,416
IT'S THEIR CRAZY-AWESOME SUPER
ECONOMY FUN-SIZE DANGO SET!

107
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,375
ALSO, EVERYONE'S BEEN
SEARCHING THE KINGDOM

108
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,833
FOR ANY ROCK THE STUPID WILD
BEAST MIGHT BE HIDING UNDER.

109
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,833
SO ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
SIT BACK AND BE PATIENT

110
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,291
AND THE GRUNTS WILL
SMOKE HIM OUT FOR US!

111
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,833
- I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

112
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,583
- WHY DON'T I GO MAKE US
A NICE CUP OF TEA?

113
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,541
- STRANGE.

114
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,416
MY INSIDES FEEL CLENCHED
FOR SOME REASON.

115
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,875
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU NEED FROM ME, LUCILE?

116
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,583
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?

117
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:50,875
- ALL YOUR LIFE.

118
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:54,000
AND IF FATE SMILES ON US SO
SHALL I ALWAYS BE.

119
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,875
YOU NEED NEVER ASK
HOW LONG I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU.

120
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,500
- I HAVE TO KNOW.
- YES?

121
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,750
- WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU
SAY TO RYNER?

122
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,416
- I MERELY GRILLED INTO HIM WHAT
GRAVE FOLLY IT WOULD BE

123
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,583
TO MAKE A PASS AT
MY BELOVED SISTER

124
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,541
A NEW EXPRESSION
FOR YOU, I SEE,

125
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,958
TRYING OUT YET ANOTHER EMOTION

126
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,791
FROM YOUR QUICKLY
EXPANDING REPERTOIRE?

127
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,958
MY HEART SOARS AS IT ACHES
AT THE SIGHT OF YOU GROWING UP.

128
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:20,041
ONE DAY YOU WILL SET OUT AGAIN
INTO THE WORLD AS A WOMAN.

129
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,333
HOW LONELY IT MAKES ME FEEL
TO THINK OF YOU OUT THERE

130
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,583
BEYOND THE REACH OF MY ARM.

131
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:28,500
- DON'T SAY THAT.
- WE HAVE A GUEST.

132
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,791
- GOOD NEWS, MISS FERRIS!

133
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,083
WE THINK WE KNOW WHERE
RYNER'S TAKEN OFF TO!

134
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,833
- AND JUST WHERE EXACTLY
MIGHT THAT BE?

135
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,916
- A WORTHY SOURCE
POINTS TO ESTABUL.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,500
- ( chuckles ) RYNER, YOU CAN'T
BEGIN TO CONCEIVE OF THE HAVOC

137
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,958
I'M ABOUT TO RAIN DOWN
UPON YOUR HEAD

138
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,125
FOR HAVING DARED BREAK
A PROMISE TO ME!

139
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,291
- ( people chattering )

140
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,250
- I JUST DON'T GET HOW SOMEONE
LIKE HIM COULD'VE BEEN BEAT.

141
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,291
WHAT ARE OUR CHANCES OF REIGNING
IN THAT MONSTER IF KLOM CAN'T?

142
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,875
- ( Noa crying )

143
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,458
- ENOUGH WITH THE HYSTERICS
ALREADY, NOA.

144
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,833
I'M WOUNDED, NOT DEAD.

145
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,291
- I'M AWARE OF THAT.

146
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,083
IF YOU WERE DEAD YOU'D HAVE
MY WRATH TO CONTEND WITH!

147
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,208
- WE'RE EXTREMELY LUCKY
NOT TO HAVE LOST YOU.

148
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,041
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WAS HIM.

149
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,916
BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT,
HE'S THE SON OF A BITCH

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,333
WHO SINGLE-HANDEDLY WIPED OUT
MY OLD BATTALION.

151
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,166
- I ASSUME YOU MEAN
THE ALPHA STIGMA.

152
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,416
- YES. AND HE WON THIS ROUND.

153
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,875
BUT MARK MY WORDS,
BY THIS TIME NEXT WEEK...

154
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,625
( grunting )

155
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:28,041
- I'M HERE FOR YOU, CLAUGH.
TRY NOT TO GET TOO WORKED UP.

156
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,375
- YOUR MAJESTY.
- LET'S GO.

157
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,666
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR,

158
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,416
IF FIELD MARSHAL KLOM HAS
FALLEN TO THE BEAST,

159
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,125
WHAT HOPE TO WE
HAVE FOR SUCCESS?

160
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,250
THE TROOPS ARE ASTIR WITH DOUBT.

161
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,708
- ( soldiers murmuring )

162
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,208
- HEAR ME, MEN!

163
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,625
REGARDLESS OF THE THREAT,
WE WILL NOT SHRINK FROM DUTY!

164
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,125
YOUR KING RIDES WITH YOU.

165
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:54,666
THE MURDEROUS CREATURE
WILL BE BROUGHT TO HEEL!

166
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,208
WE RIDE TO VICTORY!

167
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,333
- YOUR MAJESTY...

168
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:01,500
- LONG LIVE THE HERO
KING OF ROLAND!

169
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,375
- ( soldiers cheering )

170
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,958
- I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE
COMING FROM.

171
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,833
DAMN TARIFFS HAD MY FATHER
UP TO HIS EYEBALLS IN DEBT

172
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,250
TO THE TAX COLLECTORS.

173
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,750
- OKAY. SO NOW WHAT?

174
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:21,250
- ARE YOU ON A JOURNEY?
- SORT OF, I GUESS.

175
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,458
- WELL GOOD FOR YOU.
OUR NECK OF THE WOODS BOASTS

176
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,333
A HOARD OF HOT SPRINGS
AND FIRST-RATE CHOW.

177
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,083
- OH, YEAH?

178
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,791
- A LOT OF ADORABLE
BOUTIQUES HAVE OPENED UP

179
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,291
AROUND HERE LATELY, TOO.

180
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,791
THANKS OF COURSE TO HIS
ILLUSTRIOUS MAJESTY SION ASTAL.

181
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,333
BELIEVE ME, YOUNG MAN,
THIS REGION WAS A NIGHTMARE

182
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,333
FOR TRAVELERS LIKE YOU
BEFORE HE CAME.

183
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,416
AH, THE THINGS THAT GREAT MAN
HAS DONE FOR US HERE!

184
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,125
BLESS MY SOUL YOU
HAVEN'T TOUCHED

185
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,708
A SPOON FULL OF YOUR STEW.

186
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,291
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT,
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO GO WITHOUT.

187
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,833
I'LL GO WARM IT UP
IN THE KITCHEN.

188
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,416
THAT SHOULD KICK START
A GROWING BOY'S APPETITE!

189
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,333
- ( people murmuring )

190
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,541
- THE THINGS HE'S DONE
FOR YOU, HUH?

191
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,291
- ( loud thud )

192
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,333
- OH CRAP.

193
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,375
- I HOPE YOU'VE GOTTEN RUNNING
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM.

194
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,416
BECAUSE I AM ABOUT TO
CHOP OFF YOUR LEGS!

195
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,083
- PLEASE FERRIS, NO! THIS
ISN'T THE PLACE. COME ON...

196
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,416
- I'M NOT INTERESTED IN TALK!

197
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,333
- OKAY SURELY I'M NOT WORTH
WRECKING A WHOLE BUILDING OVER!

198
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:22,916
- WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
LEAVE TOGETHER!

199
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,583
I HAD FOURTEEN, FOURTEEN PACKS
OF DANGO READY FOR THE TRIP!

200
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,583
- YEAH! AND YOU EXPECTED ME TO
CARRY THEM ALL BY MYSELF

201
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,833
LIKE A PACK MULE!

202
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,250
- I'D HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO
CARRY ONE OR TWO MYSELF!

203
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,041
- THIS IS OFFICIALLY NOT
FUNNY ANYMORE.

204
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,916
- YOU'VE GOTTEN SOFT.
YOUR REFLEXES ARE SLUGGISH.

205
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,125
GOODBYE, RYNER LUTE!

206
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,666
- OH, OKAY, I GET IT.

207
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,125
YOU'VE BEEN ORDERED TO KILL ME.

208
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,083
- WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

209
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,541
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO SMASH THIS
PLACE TO PIECES JUST TO GET ME.

210
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,583
I SURE HOPE YOU GUYS CAN
COVER THE DAMAGE.

211
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,083
- AS IF I CARE A WHIT
FOR THIS PLACE.

212
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,500
DON'T EVADE.

213
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,791
ANSWER ME. WHAT IN THE WORLD
DO YOU MEAN BY SAYING

214
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,666
I MUST'VE BEEN ORDERED
TO KILL YOU?

215
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,375
SO HELP ME, IF I HAVE TO
ASK A THIRD TIME

216
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,166
I SWEAR I WILL CLEAVE YOUR HEAD
FROM YOUR SHOULDERS!

217
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,166
- IT... IT WAS NOTHING.
JUST STALLING FOR TIME.

218
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,458
- GIVE ME A BREAK. DO I LOOK
LIKE I WAS BORN YESTERDAY?

219
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,750
- LOOK, I MADE A MISTAKE. I KNOW
YOU TOO WELL, AND YOU COULDN'T.

220
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,583
- WHAT DID MY BROTHER
SAY TO YOU?

221
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:28,625
- NOTHING.

222
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,208
- I'M IN NO MOOD FOR THIS.

223
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,458
- JEEZ, GET A GRIP, ALL RIGHT?
HE DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING.

224
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,458
- APART FROM THREATENING YOU
NOT TO MAKE A PLAY

225
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,250
FOR HIS SWEET BELOVED
SISTER, YOU MEAN.

226
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,541
- HEY, HE WAS JUST DOING HIS
JOB AS YOUR BIG BROTHER.

227
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,458
- IS HE THE REASON
YOU DECIDED TO TEAR OFF

228
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,083
WITHOUT ENLIGHTENING ME?

229
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,541
- NOT EXACTLY, NO.

230
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,083
- MEANING THAT YOU, WHO STALKS
ABOUT IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT

231
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,083
THROWING HIMSELF AT INNOCENT
WOMEN AND CHILDREN,

232
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,500
WHO RESPONDS TO SUCH PLEAS AS

233
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,250
"I BEG YOU, NO! NOT MY
DAUGHTER'S BLESSED VIRTUE,"

234
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,750
FROM PANIC-STRICKEN
PARENTS EVERYWHERE

235
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,333
WITH A GLEEFULLY CALLOUS...

236
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,375
( laughs ) "I AM RYNER LUTE, THE
GRAND POTENTATE OF PERVERSITY!

237
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,541
"THE SOVEREIGN OF SALACIOUSNESS!

238
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,833
ALL VIRTUE LAYS PROSTRATE
BEFORE ME!"

239
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,416
YOU, WHO DOES TEN THINGS
TO PUSH THE LIMITS

240
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,291
OF HUMAN DECENCY
BEFORE BREAKFAST,

241
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,416
SUDDENLY BUCKLED AT THE PROSPECT
OF BEING KEPT TABS ON

242
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,958
BY A PROTECTIVE OLDER BROTHER.

243
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,666
AND SCUTTLED AWAY
LIKE A FRIGHTENED CAT.

244
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,625
WHAT KIND OF SELF-RESPECTING
PREDATOR ARE YOU?

245
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:16,833
- WHAT WORLD DO YOU LIVE IN?

246
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,041
- ( woman screaming )

247
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,041
- THERE YOU ARE.

248
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:37,041
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW LONG I'VE WAITED FOR THIS.

249
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,875
- WHAT IN THE HELL?

250
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,041
- THUS FAR, EVERYTHING
LAFRA'S TOLD ME

251
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,708
HAS BEEN RIGHT ON THE MARK.

252
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:45,291
WHICH MEANS THAT ONE OF YOU
IS WHO I'M LOOKING FOR.

253
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,375
- ( grunting )

254
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,458
- WITH MOVES LIKE THAT
IT'LL BE NO MEAN TRICK

255
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,625
FIGURING OUT WHICH OF YOU IT IS.

256
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,291
- YOU'VE GOT SOME PRETTY INHUMAN
MOVES GOING ON THERE YOURSELF,

257
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,541
HOT SHOT.

258
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,625
- WELL THAT MAKES SENSE,
SEEING AS I'M NOT HUMAN.

259
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,125
- WHAT?

260
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,791
- WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER.
IZUICHI!

261
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,458
- MY, THIS LOOKS TASTY.

262
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,833
YOU DON'T MIND IF
I HELP MYSELF.

263
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,541
THIS IS PHENOMENAL!

264
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,250
- ( groaning )

265
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,416
- ( choking )

266
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,416
- SO YOU'RE THE ALPHA STIGMA.
- WHO IN THE HELL ARE YOU.

267
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,416
- THE NAME IS TIIR RUMIBUL,

268
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,500
A BEARER OF IINO DOUE.
A MAGIC EYE.

269
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,500
AND YOU'RE THE REASON I'M HERE.

270
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,833
- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

271
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,625
- A FRIEND OF MINE SAW
YOU IN A DREAM

272
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,916
AND FELT COMPELLED TO TELL ME.

273
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,500
HE SAID YOUR WOUNDED
HEART WAS CRYING OUT,

274
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,166
THAT PEOPLE HAD HURT YOU.

275
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
AND SPEAKING OF BEING
HURT BY PEOPLE...

276
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,500
- DAMN. WHO DO THESE FOOLS
THINK THEY ARE?

277
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,583
- COME ON!

278
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,875
- HOLD YOUR FIRE!

279
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:11,958
- SION?

280
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,000
- QUICKLY YOU TWO, GET
OUT OF THE WAY!

281
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,250
- YOU HEARD THE MAN.

282
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,958
HE'S LEADING THE CHARGE?

283
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,541
- ALL TROOPS ASSUME
CASTING FORMATION!

284
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,250
WE LEAVE NOTHING TO CHANCE!

285
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,541
- NO SPELLS. JUST STICK TO
ARROWS FOR THE TIME BEING.

286
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,916
- YOU'RE ALL DEAD.
- TAKE HIM DOWN!

287
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,041
- ( groaning )

288
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,041
- NOW YOU'VE DONE IT.

289
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,833
- ( soldiers screaming )

290
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,583
- NO! SOMEBODY HELP ME!

291
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,291
- ( screaming )

292
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,250
- ORDINARY ARROWS NOT
IMBUED WITH MAGIC.

293
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,375
WISE CHOICE, I'M IMPRESSED.

294
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,458
WITHOUT NOURISHMENT I MIGHT
ACTUALLY HAVE FALLEN TO YOU LOT.

295
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,875
- HE DOESN'T JUST ABSORB MAGIC.

296
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,291
HE DEVOURS THE ESSENCE
OF LIVING HUMAN BEINGS.

297
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,291
HIS WOUNDS HEAL WHEN
HE CONSUMES.

298
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,708
- VERY NICE.

299
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:12,916
THE GRAY MATTER LOCKED IN YOUR
SKULL LOOKS SCRUMPTIOUS.

300
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,916
- READY ARROWS.

301
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,333
I'LL ASK YOU ONLY ONCE.

302
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,833
DO YOU HAVE AN INCLINATION
TO SURRENDER?

303
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,750
- NOT REALLY, NO.

304
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,083
- BE WISE. YOUR ONLY
OPTION IS DEATH.

305
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,500
- THAT SO? AND WHAT IF I JUST
HAPPEN TO BE QUICK ENOUGH

306
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,458
TO EAT YOU BEFORE
THE ARROWS TOUCH ME?

307
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,791
- A CLEVER RUSE.

308
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,541
BUT IF YOU COULD EAT ME
YOU'D HAVE DONE SO BY NOW.

309
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:34,166
- NOT IF I DIDN'T FEEL KEEN ON
ROUSING THE FURY OF YOUR LAPDOG.

310
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,208
WOULDN'T WANT TO TANGLE WITH
ANOTHER ALPHA STIGMA.

311
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,500
- HIS LAPDOG?

312
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,916
- DON'T TELL ME RYNER LUTE
IS AN ALPHA STIGMA?

313
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,500
- OH, NO.
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!

314
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,083
- YOU MEAN WE'RE CAUGHT
BETWEEN TWO OF THEM?

315
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,666
- RUN AWAY!
JUST RUN AWAY!

316
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,833
- HE'S A MONSTER.
A REEKING, BLOODTHIRSTY BRUTE!

317
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,791
- HE SHOULD BE PUT DOWN
LIKE A DOG!

318
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,000
- QUIET, ALL OF YOU!
I WON'T HAVE THIS!

319
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,916
- DON'T SAY YOU'RE SURPRISED.
IT'S THE WAY OF HUMANS.

320
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,333
WE'LL NEVER BE A PART
OF THE FOLD

321
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,000
AS FAR AS THEY'RE CONCERNED.

322
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,916
DEEP DOWN YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.

323
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,625
- ENOUGH OF YOUR LIES.
HOW DARE YOU PRESUME

324
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,791
TO SPEAK TO MY FRIEND LIKE
YOU WERE EQUALS.

325
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,166
RYNER IS NOTHING LIKE YOU!

326
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,583
- WE'RE NOT ALL THAT
DIFFERENT, ARE WE?

327
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:29,041
OR MAYBE YOU MEAN TO SUGGEST I'M
NOTHING LIKE YOUR FRIEND THERE.

328
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,375
BECAUSE I'M A MONSTER?

329
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,708
YOU MIND IF I CALL YOU RYNER?

330
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:37,125
SO RYNER, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE DITCH THESE BRUTES?

331
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,666
SOMETHING TELLS ME THIS PLACE
ISN'T A GOOD FIT FOR YOU.

332
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,958
- COME ON, RYNER, THERE'S
NO POINT LISTENING TO HIM.

333
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,875
HE'S FILLING YOUR
HEAD WITH TRIPE.

334
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,583
- FOREVER SCORNED AS A MONSTER,
HUNTED DOWN AS TABOO.

335
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,625
WHAT'S THE POINT OF GIVING
ANOTHER MOMENT OF YOUR TIME

336
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,958
TO A LIFE LIKE THAT?

337
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,583
DON'T YOU THINK THERE'S A
HIGHER CALLING FOR YOU?

338
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,666
LEAVE THIS PLACE AND
COME WITH ME.

339
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,625
I HAVE MORE FRIENDS THAN
YOU'VE EVER DREAMED OF KNOWING.

340
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,500
FIRE MAGIC DANCES IN
MY EYES LIKE LIGHTNING.

341
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,458
IF YOU JOIN ME, THE
TWO OF US CAN ESCAPE

342
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,000
AND I CAN FULLY RECOVER.

343
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,333
WE CAN BE FREE OF HUMANITY'S
BIGOTRY AND OPPRESSION FOREVER!

344
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,166
- THIS IS ABSOLUTE ROT.
FIRE ON MY SIGNAL!

345
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,958
- YOU WON'T WIN
THE DAY LIKE THAT.

346
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,083
A HYPOCRITE LIKE YOU COULD NEVER
HOPE TO APPRECIATE THE BETRAYAL

347
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,916
THAT DWELLS IN THE
HEARTS OF OUR KIND.

348
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,958
RYNER UNDERSTANDS.
DON'T YOU, RYNER?

349
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:29,416
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. I DON'T
BLAME EITHER ONE OF YOU.

350
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,208
I'D FEEL THE SAME WAY
IF I WAS IN YOUR SHOES.

351
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,041
- I DIDN'T SCOUR THE
COUNTRYSIDE LOOKING FOR YOU

352
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,125
TO HEAR THIS KIND OF CRAP!

353
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,958
- PLEASE UNDERSTAND, GUYS.

354
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,000
IT'S NOT LIKE I HOLD
ANYTHING AGAINST YOU.

355
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,541
IT'S JUST THAT I'VE CAUSED
ENOUGH TROUBLE FOR BOTH OF YOU

356
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,958
AND YOU DESERVE A BREAK FROM
HAVING TO DEAL WITH ME.

357
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,750
- RYNER, PLEASE.

358
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,166
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

359
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,875
I GET WHY YOU GAVE LUKE
STOKKART THE ORDER TO KILL ME

360
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,666
IF I EVER GOT OUT OF HAND.

361
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,125
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

362
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,625
- THAT'S WHAT YOU MEANT
WHEN YOU'D THOUGHT

363
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,125
I'D BEEN SENT TO KILL YOU?

364
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,583
- ( laughing )

365
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,708
- LISTEN TO ME!
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK!

366
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,750
- YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE
KINGDOM TO WORRY ABOUT.

367
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,875
I CAN IMAGINE WHAT KIND OF
BURDEN THAT MUST BE.

368
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:09,041
YOU AREN'T IN THE WRONG FOR
WANTING TO PROTECT IT FROM ME.

369
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,666
- RYNER...

370
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,166
- DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M SOME
KIND OF WOUNDED ANIMAL, SION.

371
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,166
THE BLAME'S ALL ON MY HEAD.

372
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,458
WE BOTH KNOW ALL I'M GOOD FOR IS
SPREADING DEATH AND DESTRUCTION.

373
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,625
- DAMN YOU! THAT IS NOT
WHAT YOU ARE!

374
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,625
- YOU'VE SUFFERED ENOUGH
WORRYING ABOUT ME.

375
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:26,083
SO AS OF THIS MOMENT I AM
NO LONGER YOUR PROBLEM.

376
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,541
- Ferris: DON'T DO THIS.

377
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,916
- SORRY, FERRIS. WHAT I SEEK
IS THUNDER...

378
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,291
- I WON'T LET YOU DO THIS!
ALL TROOPS FIRE ARROWS, NOW!

379
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,333
DON'T SUFFER THE MONSTER TO
LIVE A SECOND MORE!

380
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,416
- DO IT.

381
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,125
- IZUCHI.

382
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,333
- FOLLOW ME AND I'LL INTRODUCE
YOU TO YOUR NEW FRIENDS.

383
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,666
- DON'T GO.

384
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,541
DON'T GO!

385
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,416
- THE MENACE HAS FLED!
VICTORY BELONGS TO US!

386
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,291
- ( cheering )

387
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,583
- THREE CHEERS FOR SION ASTAL!

388
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,958
- THREE CHEERS FOR THE
HERO KING OF ROLAND!

389
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,750
- THE "HERO KING."

390
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,250
- I'M SORRY, FERRIS.

391
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:46,666
- RYNER WAS RIGHT.
YOU'RE BLAMELESS IN ALL THIS.

392
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,125
YOU'RE MERELY FULFILLING YOUR
DUTIES AS A RULER, NOTHING MORE.

393
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,416
- HIS MAJESTY TRIUMPHED
OVER THE MONSTER

394
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,333
AGAINST INSURMOUNTABLE ODDS!

395
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,416
- ONCE AGAIN THE
PEOPLE ARE SAFE!

396
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,791
- NOT HAVING SECOND
THOUGHTS, ARE YOU?

397
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,791
- NO, NOT REALLY.

398
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,125
I NEVER MUCH CARED FOR
THEIR COUNTRY ANYWAY.

399
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,708
- ( theme song playing )

400
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,125
- I ASSUME YOUR LADYSHIP
IS SALLYING FORTH

401
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:25,416
IN SEARCH OF THE ULTIMATE DANGO?

402
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,083
- NO.

403
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:36,125
MY GOAL THIS TIME
ISN'T WHAT I EXPECTED.

404
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,500
BUT THEN FOOLS NEVER ARE.

405
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,291
- OKAY, LET ME BE PERFECTLY
CLEAR, I FRIGGIN' LOATHE KIDS.

406
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,833
THEY'RE LOUD,
OBNOXIOUS, DEMANDING,

407
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,000
IMPOSSIBLE TO REASON WITH...

408
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,625
AND COMMUNAL LIVING?

409
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,750
FEWER THINGS SUCK MORE.

410
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,125
WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE? LAY OFF!

411
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,041
NOBODY SAID I WAS
YOUR DAMN FRIEND!
