1
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:21,125
Ryner: I OFFER UP THIS CONTRACT
TO BEAR THE WICKED SPIRIT BEAST

2
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,583
THAT SLEEPS WITHIN THE EARTH!

3
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,458
THERE'S NO ESCAPING
KUU, MY FRIEND!

4
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,708
( Ferris screams and
swords clash )

5
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,250
- OH, YES! RYNER!

6
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,083
BEFORE WE PART WAYS,
ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,958
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND KUKU...

8
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,833
SHE IS BEING CONFINED IN
THE MANOR OF A NOBLE

9
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,208
OF THIS TERRITORY.

10
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,666
WE'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU THERE.

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,750
- I WILL MAKE YOU REGRET THIS.

12
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,291
- ( theme song playing )

13
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,000
- ( birds chirping )

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,166
- FERRIS IS SURE TAKING
HER SWEET TIME.

15
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,375
- I WONDER IF KUU HAS
BEEN GIVING HER ANY TROUBLE.

16
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,250
YEAH, WELL...

17
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,500
I GUESS IT'S NOT LIKE SHE
CAN'T HANDLE HERSELF

18
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:43,875
IF IT COMES DOWN TO IT.

19
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,041
- THAT'S HOW AN ALPHA
STIGMA IS CONTAINED.

20
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,458
DIDN'T YOU KNOW?

21
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:53,333
CAN ONE TRULY BE SO IN THE DARK
ABOUT HIS OWN POWERS?

22
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,083
- IF THERE'S ANYTHING
TO THAT METHOD...

23
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,875
I WONDER WHETHER OR NOT
IT'D SAVE YOU.

24
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,166
I MEAN, YOU HAVEN'T
REALLY HURT ANYONE YET.

25
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,375
I'D GOUGE IT OUT OF
YOU MYSELF IF I COULD.

26
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,791
BEFORE YOUR MIND
BECOMES SO DAMAGED

27
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,000
THAT EXTRACTION IS POINTLESS.

28
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,541
- ( grimacing )

29
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,208
WHERE AM I?

30
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,458
( gasps and screams )

31
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,750
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,750
WHERE HAVE MY MOTHER
AND FATHER GONE?

33
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,541
I SAW THEM... THEY...

34
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,708
( screaming and sobbing )

35
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,791
THEY'RE DEAD AND
IT'S ALL MY FAULT!

36
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:43,833
EVERYONE... EVERYONE I
KNOW IS... I...

37
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,500
YOU... YOU MURDERED MY
PARENTS TO GET AT ME,

38
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,625
DIDN'T YOU?

39
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,916
I'LL KILL YOU!

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,083
- GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF, KID.

41
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,083
- WHY ME?
IT'S NOT FAIR!

42
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,333
TELL ME ONE THING I
EVER DID TO DESERVE THIS?

43
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,250
JUST STOP IT!

44
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,333
I NEVER WANTED THIS!
I NEVER WANTED ANY OF THIS!

45
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,791
AND NOW MY MOTHER AND
FATHER ARE DEAD BECAUSE OF ME!

46
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,375
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

47
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,250
- YOU CAN RUN AWAY.
OR YOU CAN LAY THERE AND DIE.

48
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,125
I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU.

49
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,708
FAR BE IT FROM ME TO DISPUTE
WHATEVER FANTASY

50
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,250
YOU HAVE OF SALVATION.

51
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,208
- I WASN'T BORN
YESTERDAY, CREEP.

52
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,416
YOU INTEND TO KILL ME,
DON'T YOU?

53
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,000
MONSTERS LIKE ME
DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE.

54
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,166
- YEAH.

55
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:24,958
ABOUT THAT.

56
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,708
- ( gasps )

57
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,833
- I'VE BEEN GIVING THE MATTER
A LOT OF THOUGHT.

58
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,291
- IT'S A HELL OF A THING
WHEN THE MERE FACT

59
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,458
OF YOUR EXISTENCE MEANS
PEOPLE YOU LOVE GET HURT.

60
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,416
GET KILLED.

61
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,750
WORSE STILL, THAT THE PEOPLE
LUCKY ENOUGH TO SURVIVE

62
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,125
SHUN YOU AS A DEMON.

63
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,291
TENDS TO MAKE YOU START
ASKING QUESTIONS,

64
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,125
MOST OF WHICH BEGIN WITH "WHY?"

65
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,708
WHEN FOLKS EITHER RECOIL
FROM YOU OR WIND UP DEAD

66
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,125
FOR THE EFFORT OF
TRYING TO GET CLOSE,

67
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,541
HELL, WHAT SANE PERSON
WOULDN'T JUST WANT

68
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,375
TO CURL UP AND DIE?

69
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,916
THAT WAS THE CRUX OF
MY THINKING FOR A LONG TIME.

70
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,875
BUT...

71
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,958
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT
THAT WAS IT FOR ME,

72
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,541
SOMEBODY GOT THROUGH.

73
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:08,916
A NAIVE WOULD-BE KING WHO
SOMEHOW SAW A LITTLE GOOD IN ME.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,916
A SCARED YOUNG GIRL WHO
TRIED TO CONVINCE ME

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,750
I WASN'T A MONSTER...

76
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,625
AND... MORE RECENTLY...

77
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,333
A SWORD-WIELDING
PSYCHOTIC ICE NYMPH

78
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,125
WHO TREATS ME
LIKE A PINCUSHION.

79
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,000
BUT IT DOES MAKE ME WONDER
IF I JUDGED MYSELF TOO HARSHLY.

80
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,041
IF MAYBE, I DON'T KNOW...

81
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,000
LIFE CAN WORK.

82
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,041
THESE DAYS WHEN I DREAM,
I DREAM I'M BUILDING A WORLD.

83
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,333
ONE WHERE THE PEOPLE
I CARE ABOUT CAN THRIVE,

84
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,083
WHERE LIFE MAKES SENSE TO ALL,

85
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,083
WHERE I DON'T RAMBLE
ON LIKE A TOTAL LUNATIC.

86
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,500
- THAT'S WHERE YOU AND
ME PART WAYS, THEN.

87
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,375
EVERY LAST PERSON WHO
CARED IF I LIVE OR DIE IS GONE.

88
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,083
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR OLD MAN?
WHAT WAS THE LAST THING HE SAID?

89
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,041
- DON'T DARE BLAME YOURSELF
FOR MY DEATH EITHER, SON.

90
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,291
YOU LIVE.
YOU HAVE TO GO ON.

91
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,916
- YOU'RE WRONG.
THERE IS SOMEONE LEFT.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,166
WE DIDN'T JUST FALL OUT
OF THE SKY TO RESCUE YOU.

93
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,833
A LITTLE GIRL NAMED KUKU WAS
DESPERATE FOR US TO INTERVENE.

94
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:04,916
- SHE WAS?

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,458
- AT THE MOMENT,
SHE'S BEING HELD HOSTAGE

96
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,625
BY A COUPLE OF BAD APPLES

97
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,583
WHO INTEND TO LURE
YOU INTO A TRAP.

98
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,416
OF COURSE THE
NOBLE THING TO DO

99
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,083
WOULD BE TO TRY
TO SWOOP IN AND GET HER.

100
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,833
- BUT, I MEAN, COME ON...
- BUT NOTHING!

101
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,416
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO!

102
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,791
- BE REALISTIC, KID.
YOU CAN'T EVEN FIGHT.

103
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,625
- THAT'S NO EXCUSE FOR
LEAVING MY BEST FRIEND TO ROT!

104
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,291
JUST TEACH ME WHAT
I NEED TO KNOW.

105
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,916
- Ferris: LOOKOUT!

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,250
- WELCOME BACK, FERRIS.

107
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,083
- DON'T BE TAKEN IN
BY HIS WILES.

108
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,125
NOT ONLY DOES HE SPEND
THE BETTER PART OF HIS TIME

109
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,375
SLUMBERING WHILE
THE WORLD LIMPS ON,

110
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,833
HE'S BEEN THE RUIN OF SO
MANY VIRTUOUS YOUNG WOMEN

111
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:38,041
THAT VICE'S MOST STALWART
CHRONICLERS HAVE LOST COUNT.

112
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,250
ALAS, CONSCIENCE
FORBIDS GREATER DETAIL

113
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,916
WITHIN EARSHOT OF A CHILD.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,958
YOU DON'T REALLY DO
THOSE THINGS, DO YOU?

115
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,500
DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO FERRIS.

116
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,791
SHE... IS A MASTER
OF EXAGGERATION.

117
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,666
- IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, MA'AM.

118
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,875
- WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
WHAT HE'D HAVE TO LEARN

119
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,958
IN ORDER TO HELP US
RESCUE HIS LITTLE FRIEND.

120
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,125
- WE DON'T DARE RISK
THE BOY'S PURITY

121
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,416
BY LEAVING HIS
INSTRUCTION TO A PERVERT.

122
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,791
- COME, FOLLOW ME, ARUA.

123
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,750
- I WOULD BE HONORED TO,
MISS FERRIS.

124
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,625
- ( yawning )

125
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,375
GOOD OL' FASHIONED
MARTIAL ARTS.

126
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,750
BETWEEN THAT AND
HIS ALPHA STIGMA,

127
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,083
KID MAY HAVE A SHOT.

128
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,291
HELL, HE MIGHT BE A
FORCE IN HIS OWN RIGHT

129
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,041
BEFORE IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE.

130
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,916
- ( Arua screaming in pain )

131
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,291
- IF HE SURVIVES
FERRIS, NATURALLY.

132
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,625
- Ryner: ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S WHERE SHE'S BEING HELD.

133
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,000
NOW WE DEFINITELY WANT ARUA

134
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,416
TO BE THE KNIGHT IN
SHINING ARMOR OF THIS STORY.

135
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,458
THAT IS, OF COURSE,
IF YOU'RE SURE.

136
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,791
YES, I'M MORE SURE
THAN I'VE EVER BEEN.

137
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,250
SO LET'S GO.

138
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,875
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO
FOR KUKU AFTER WHAT SHE DID.

139
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,125
- YOU MAY NOT SURVIVE.

140
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,916
STOP TRYING TO
TALK ME OUT OF THIS!

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,458
I'M GOING IN THERE, OKAY!

142
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,875
- RUSHED THOUGH IT WAS,
YOU'VE BEEN TRAINED EXPERTLY.

143
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,958
I TAKE FULL CREDIT
FOR YOU NOT IN ANY WAY

144
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,875
RESEMBLING THE FILTHY OLD MAN.

145
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:05,000
- OLD MAN? I HOPE THAT'S
NOT A JAB AT YOURS TRULY.

146
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,458
- IF THE SHOE FITS,

147
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,833
WHEN IT COMES TO VILE,
LASCIVIOUS NE'ER-DO-WELLS,

148
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,166
YOU'VE HELD THE HIGHEST
RANK FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES.

149
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,333
- I HAVEN'T BEEN ALIVE
FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES!

150
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,458
- ( footsteps shuffling )

151
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,583
- Ferris: YOU'D THINK
THEY'D BE WAITING IN AMBUSH.

152
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,250
- NOT IF GIVEN HALF A CHANCE
AT MAKING FOOLS OF US.

153
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,208
- OH, DON'T FRET.
WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

154
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,958
THE AILECRONE SCYTHE
IS TERRIBLY FAMISHED.

155
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,541
I INTEND TO GLUT IT.

156
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,958
- IT MUST BE SAID,
YOU CERTAINLY TOOK YOUR TIME.

157
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,250
- IS THE GIRL SAFE OR ISN'T SHE?

158
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,958
- YOU DON'T THINK WE'D HARM
SO VALUABLE A HOSTAGE?

159
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,875
- WE DON'T TYPICALLY
RESORT TO USING LIVES

160
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,333
AS BARGAINING CHIPS,
BUT MY DEAR BROTHER INSISTED

161
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,500
THAT THIS SITUATION
WAS DELICATE.

162
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,000
- YOU TWO CAN'T HOPE
TO WIN AGAINST US.

163
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,375
HAVE YOU ALREADY FORGOTTEN
WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME?

164
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,333
- INDEED. YOUR POWER
IS ALL THE MORE REASON

165
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,958
FOR US TO HAVE
CALLED YOU HERE.

166
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,666
AT THE RISK OF
SOUNDING FORWARD,

167
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,541
WE'D LIKE TO ASK THAT YOU PUT
THAT POWER TO EXCELLENT USE

168
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,125
IN SERVITUDE TO THE
GREAT KINGDOM OF GASTARK.

169
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,125
- YOU KIDDING ME?

170
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,000
- VERY SOON THE WHOLE WORLD
WILL STAND IN THE SHADOW

171
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,416
OF GASTARK'S BANNER.

172
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,875
A WORLD UNITED UNDER THE
AUSPICES OF A VISIONARY KING,

173
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
FREE OF DISCRIMINATION,
FREE OF STRIFE,

174
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,791
WHERE TEARS FLOW NO LONGER

175
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,625
AND HAPPINESS IS
THE ORDER OF THE DAY.

176
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,708
SUCH IS THE MIND OF
LEFAHL EDEA, OUR KING,

177
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,333
WHO POSSESSES
NOT ONLY THE DESIRE

178
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,375
BUT THE MEANS
TO SHAPE THAT WORLD.

179
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,875
- ( amused chuckle )

180
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,166
TO HEAR YOU PUT IT LIKE
THAT, HE DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD.

181
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,583
IT'S EXTREMELY TEMPTING...

182
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:33,875
- GO ON.

183
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,333
- I LIKE THE WAY YOU WORD IT.

184
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,500
"A WORLD WHERE HAPPINESS
IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY. "

185
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,541
IF THAT REALLY IS YOUR
KING'S ULTIMATE GOAL,

186
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,916
MAYBE JOINING YOU GUYS WOULDN'T
BE SUCH A TERRIBLE IDEA,

187
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,208
WHICH IS TO SAY YOU DO
PAINT A VERY COMPELLING PICTURE.

188
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,833
- ( whispering )
ARE YOU MAD?

189
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,791
- DO YOU TAKE OUR HAND
IN FRIENDSHIP?

190
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,875
- NOT SO FAST.

191
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,458
IF WORLD PEACE IS REALLY
WHAT ALL THIS HAS BEEN ABOUT,

192
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,875
WHY DOES "ALL THIS" LOOK LIKE
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ABOLISH?

193
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,708
YOU DIDN'T EXACTLY COME
BY THOSE HERO RELICS

194
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,208
BY SOWING HAPPINESS
IN YOUR WAKE.

195
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,500
HELL, YOU ROUSED
AN ALPHA STIGMA

196
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,041
JUST TO TRY TO
HARNESS HIS STRENGTH.

197
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:09,208
FOR PEACE-MONGERS, YOU'VE GOT
A LOT OF BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS.

198
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,958
IF THAT'S THE KIND OF
THING I CAN LOOK FORWARD TO

199
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,833
BY "USING MY POWER IN
SERVITUDE TO GASTARK,"

200
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,208
YOU CAN TELL YOUR PRECIOUS
KING TO KISS MY ASS.

201
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,541
YOUR COUNTRY WILL
NEVER BE MY HOME.

202
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,833
NOT SO LONG AS IT TREATS
ALPHA STIGMAS LIKE OUTCASTS,

203
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:26,416
OR WORSE, AS WEAPONS IN SOME
HYPOCRITICAL MISSION OF PEACE.

204
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,333
- HOW DARE YOU?

205
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,250
- IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO HURL
CLICHES AND PLATITUDES

206
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,791
AT US FOR WHAT WE DO,

207
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,583
BUT THE REALITY OF OUR SITUATION
DOESN'T ADMIT OF SIMPLICITY.

208
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,708
COLLATERAL DAMAGE AMASSES
IN REVOLUTIONS OF ANY SCALE.

209
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,041
IT'S NOT AS THOUGH WE
ENJOY HAVING TO KILL.

210
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,666
THE LIFE OF EACH HUMAN BEING
WE'RE COMPELLED TO SNUFF OUT

211
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,250
WEIGHS ON OUR CONSCIENCE.

212
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,041
- NOT A FRACTION AS MUCH
AS IT OUGHT TO!

213
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,625
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW
MANY PEOPLE I'VE KILLED.

214
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,291
HOW MANY INNOCENT LIVES
I'VE "SNUFFED OUT"

215
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,208
IN THRALL TO THIS DAMN CURSE.

216
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,791
I USED TO THINK THAT
CLINGING TO LIFE WAS EVIL,

217
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,916
THAT I WAS DEATH INCARNATE.

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,833
BUT DEATH, ARUA IS NOT.

219
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,666
HE HASN'T KILLED ANYONE YET.

220
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,250
AND WITH LUCK I CAN KEEP HIM
FROM EVER CROSSING THAT LINE.

221
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,541
THE ONLY THING YOU SEE IN HIM
IS EITHER SOMETHING TO HARNESS,

222
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,333
OR SOMETHING TO ERADICATE.

223
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,583
NEITHER OF YOU
SEE IN HIM WHAT I DO.

224
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:18,833
NAMELY THAT HE'S HUMAN.

225
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,125
- AS NOBLE AS THE
SENTIMENT IS IN THEORY

226
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,416
YOU COULD SEARCH
THE ENTIRE WORLD

227
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,708
AND NEVER ONCE
HEAR IT ECHOED.

228
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,166
- AH, BUT THE PLACE
I CALL HOME

229
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,458
GIVES THE LIE TO YOUR WORDS.

230
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,875
THE KING OF ROLAND
ISN'T LIKE YOUR KING.

231
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,250
HE DOESN'T JUST PAY LIP
SERVICE TO THE IDEA OF PEACE.

232
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,833
HE ACTUALLY BELIEVES
THE MEANS AND ENDS

233
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,583
OUGHT TO RESEMBLE
ONE ANOTHER.

234
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,166
AND WHEN I TALK ABOUT ENDS,

235
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,500
I MEAN A PEOPLE'S REVOLUTION
THAT WILL MAKE EVERY ROCK,

236
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,291
EVERY PEBBLE IN
THE REALM, QUAKE.

237
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,166
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, HE'S
DELUDED ENOUGH TO THINK

238
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,541
IT CAN BE ACHIEVED
WITHOUT VIOLENCE.

239
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,750
A FLEA CAN'T DIE ON HIS WATCH

240
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:50,916
BUT THAT HE'S
RACKED WITH GUILT

241
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,875
AND BLAMES HIMSELF FOR IT.

242
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,041
THAT WHY, FOR ALL HIS AIRS, I
ALIGN MYSELF TO THE MAN PROUDLY.

243
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,791
BECAUSE IN THE WORLD
HE INTENDS TO BUILD,

244
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,958
EVERY LAST ONE OF US MATTERS.

245
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,833
- YOU'RE NOT SO NAIVE
AS TO THINK HE NEEDN'T

246
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,083
CRACK A FEW HEADS
IN THE PROCESS?

247
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,416
KINGS DON'T CARRY THE WEIGHT
OF THEIR VISION LIGHTLY.

248
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,958
THE ROAD TO PEACE IS
FRAUGHT WITH DILEMMAS, YES?

249
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,333
- TRUST ME, IF HE STARTS
FOLLOWING YOUR KING'S EXAMPLE

250
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,583
I'LL MAKE SURE THE FIRST
HEAD CRACKED IS HIS OWN.

251
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,333
- ( Kuu sneers )

252
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,250
- SO NEGOTIATIONS
HAVE BROKEN DOWN?

253
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,541
- I HATE TO BREAK IT
TO YOU, PAL,

254
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,208
BUT WE WERE NEVER NEGOTIATING.

255
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,208
WE'RE HERE TO GET
THE GIRL BACK.

256
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,291
ARE YOU READY?

257
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,166
- HIS WORDS DID HAVE ME
ENSNARED THERE FOR A BIT.

258
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,500
A WORLD WITHOUT STRIFE
WOULD BE A LOVELY ONE.

259
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,875
- DON'T RULE ANYTHING
OUT, PARTNER.

260
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,916
- PLEASE. NOW'S NOT THE TIME.
LET'S GO.

261
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,125
- OF COURSE. RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

262
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,250
- NOW, KUU!

263
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,958
( screaming )

264
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,958
HONESTLY, THIS ONE
I WILL ENJOY.

265
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,833
- I OFFER UP A CONTRACT TO
BEAR THE WICKED SPIRIT BEAST

266
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,333
THAT SLEEPS
WITHIN THE EARTH!

267
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,333
- ( explosion booms )

268
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,541
- IT ISN'T TOO LATE TO
CHANGE YOUR MIND, YOU KNOW.

269
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,083
COME NOW, WON'T YOU RECONSIDER?

270
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,250
- LIKE HELL.
WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER!

271
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,208
- I HOPE YOU'RE NOT OPERATING
UNDER THE ASSUMPTION

272
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,708
THAT A RULE FRAGMENT CAN
BE TAKEN DOWN SO EASILY.

273
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,291
- IZUCHI!

274
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,458
- ( Sui gasps )

275
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,041
- ICE WALL.

276
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,041
- BURN HER!
- NO, YOU DON'T!

277
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,458
- FROM THE WEST I CALL
THE EMPTY, THE FORMATION,

278
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,625
- WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER!
- Sui: THE YANG!

279
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,375
- Ryner: IZUCHI!

280
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,125
- I BRING FORTH THE BRILLIANCE.
( screams )

281
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,541
WHAT IN THE...

282
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,708
I'VE LOST.

283
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,000
- Kuu: THEY'VE AN ALLY
IN HIDING.

284
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,083
- WELL CRAP, THERE GOES
THAT PLAN.

285
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,958
I THOUGHT WE'D GET 'EM
BEFORE THEY FIGURED IT OUT.

286
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,958
OPERATION SURPRISE ATTACK
HAS OFFICIALLY FALLEN FLAT.

287
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,291
CALL THE BOY DOWN.

288
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,166
- ARUA!

289
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,416
- Arua: YES. SIR!

290
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,208
- MEDDLING WITH THE VERY
STRUCTURE OF YOUR SPELLS.

291
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,958
AN INTERESTING MOVE,

292
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,541
HAVING THE BOY STRIKE
FROM OFFSTAGE

293
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,708
WHILE YOUR OWN INVOCATION MERELY
DIRECTED THE PATH OF HIS ENERGY.

294
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,750
- BIT OF A CHEAP TRICK, GRANTED,
BUT WAS IT THAT OBVIOUS?

295
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,833
SHEESH. MAYBE I REALLY
SHOULD RECONSIDER.

296
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:58,125
- IMAGINE A PAIR OF ALPHA
STIGMAS BANKING ON DECEIT.

297
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,708
I'M RATHER
DISAPPOINTED WITH MYSELF

298
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:00,833
FOR NOT HAVING PIECED TOGETHER

299
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,000
YOUR INELEGANT
LITTLE RUSE SOONER.

300
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,791
IT WAS TERRIBLY DISORIENTING
AT FIRST, I'LL ADMIT.

301
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,000
- SO SHOULD I FEEL
HONORED OR INSULTED?

302
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,166
- I DO BELIEVE I'VE REACHED
AN EPIPHANY IN THIS BATTLE.

303
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,583
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOUR KIND

304
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,000
ARE IN SUCH DISCORD
WITH HUMANITY.

305
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,208
FOR MOST, YOU'RE THE STUFF
OF MIND-SHATTERING NIGHTMARE.

306
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,083
BELIEVE ME, WE DON'T
NEED YOU TO TELL US THAT.

307
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,375
BUT BETWEEN LIVING IN FEAR
OF HARMING OUR LOVED ONES

308
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,916
AND THE CONSTANT
WORRY OF BEING HOUNDED

309
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,333
LIKE ANIMALS BY STRANGERS...

310
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,208
- I'M GONNA GO OUT ON
A LIMB FOR A SECOND

311
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,833
AND SUGGEST THAT
MAYBE THE LARGER SHARE

312
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,750
OF THAT NIGHTMARE IS OUR OWN.

313
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,458
- THEN WHY NOT BE
KIND ENOUGH TO DIE?

314
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,041
HAVING TO FIGHT YOU
AGAIN IN THE FUTURE

315
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,250
IS NOT A MERRY PROSPECT.

316
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,583
- I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.

317
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,666
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO THE HELL HOME?

318
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,083
- KUU?

319
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:53,000
- KUKU!
- YOU DIRTY SON OF A BITCH.

320
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,791
- YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT OUR
HAVING NO HOPE AGAINST YOU.

321
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,416
SADLY, THAT LEAVES US NO CHOICE

322
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,416
BUT TO BRING THIS
MEETING TO A FINISH.

323
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,125
ALONG WITH THIS SWEET
LITTLE THING'S LIFE.

324
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,541
- PLEASE, NO!

325
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,083
- DAMN IT!

326
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,875
- TOO LATE FOR THAT, I'M AFRAID!

327
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,291
- LEAVE HER ALONE!

328
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,708
- ( claw slashing )
- (Sui screaming )

329
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,375
- ( Sui grunting in pain )

330
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,625
( panting )

331
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,000
- IMPOSSIBLE. IT CAN'T BE.
( gasps )

332
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,291
- ( Sui grunting )

333
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,875
- THIS CANNOT BE HAPPENING.

334
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,750
ONLY A RULE FRAGMENT
LIKE BROTHER LIR'S

335
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,208
COULD'VE CAUSED SO
MUCH DAMAGE SO QUICKLY...

336
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,666
- Miran: RULE FRAGMENT?

337
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,625
ANOTHER TERM TO GROUP
WITH "HERO RELICS"

338
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,666
I ASSUME.

339
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,875
INTERESTING.

340
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,500
TWO CONCEPTS ALTOGETHER
FOREIGN TO ME.

341
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,750
- IT'S HIM.
THE MAN WE FOUGHT IN NELPHA.

342
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,750
- WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING IN RUNA?

343
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,125
- Kuu: SUI! SUI, GET UP!

344
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:11,083
- JUST GET OUT OF HERE.
LEAVE ME.

345
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,041
- SO, YOU TWO ARE
THE TROUBLEMAKERS

346
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,833
WHO'VE INCITED RUNA TO DISSENT.

347
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,166
AMBITIOUS... BUT FOR NAUGHT.

348
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,875
LET THERE BE DARKNESS!

349
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,791
- WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER!
IZUCHI!

350
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,750
- YOU IDIOT.

351
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,500
WHY ON EARTH WOULD
YOU HAVE DEFLECTED THAT?

352
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,500
- CALL IT A FAVOR,
PAY ME BACK ANOTHER TIME.

353
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,291
NOW GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

354
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,666
- Miran: I MUST CONFESS
THIS SITUATION

355
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,708
DOES NOT SIT WELL WITH ME.

356
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,083
I HAD THE PLEASURE
OF OVERHEARING

357
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,208
THE BULK OF YOUR
IDEOLOGICAL EXCHANGE.

358
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,791
I'M AFRAID THERE'S
NO ROOM FOR DOUBT.

359
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,125
THE TWO OF YOU CERTAINLY
HAIL FROM ROLAND.

360
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,083
WHICH MAKES YOUR BOLD
DEFENSE OF THE INTERLOPERS

361
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,750
DISTURBINGLY SUGGESTIVE.

362
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,458
- THE THREE OF YOU SHARE
MORE IN COMMON THAN WE DO.

363
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,291
WE'RE NOT ASSASSINS.

364
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,458
WE DON'T MOW DOWN
WHOEVER'S IN OUR WAY.

365
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,333
- ALPHA STIGMA.
HERO RELICS.

366
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,541
WHAT TANGLED WEB
DOES HIS MAJESTY WEAVE

367
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,000
BEYOND MY KNOWLEDGE?

368
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:15,458
- ER, HEY. HOLD ON.
YOU'RE JUST WALKING AWAY?

369
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,750
- THERE'S NO NEED
FOR ME TO STAY

370
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,250
WHEN OUR BATTLE CAN JUST
AS EASILY BE POSTPONED.

371
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,916
- IF I MAY BE SO BRAZEN AS
TO OFFER YOU BOTH MY INSIGHT,

372
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,958
WOULD YOU SCOFF AT ITS
TAKING SHAPE AS A WARNING?

373
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,666
- I DON'T GUESS SO?
- GOOD.

374
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,416
I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR IT.

375
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,625
- YOU JUST SUGGESTED
THAT I MOW DOWN

376
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,416
THOSE WHO STAND IN MY WAY.

377
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,333
BUT ASK YOURSELF ONE QUESTION.

378
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,250
"WHAT SORT OF WORLD WOULD
BE LEFT WERE I TO HAVE MY WAY?"

379
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,875
- THE SIMPLE ANSWER TO WHICH IS
A WORLD PEOPLED ENTIRELY BY

380
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:46,375
THOSE WHOSE LIVES I DEEM
CONVENIENT TO MY PURPOSES.

381
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,833
YET...

382
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,583
IF AN ALPHA STIGMA
WERE TO HAVE ITS WAY,

383
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,208
WOULD NOT THE
LANDSCAPE LEFT IN THE WAKE

384
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,833
OF SUCH UNQUENCHABLE BLOODLUST

385
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,958
RESEMBLE IN MOST PARTICULARS
MY OWN IDEAL WORLD?

386
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,166
THINK ABOUT IT.

387
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,708
HUMAN BEINGS SUSTAIN THEMSELVES
ON THE BLOODIEST OF CONFLICTS.

388
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,958
ALWAYS HAVE. IT'S PART OF
THEIR ESSENTIAL NATURE.

389
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,333
HAPPINESS WILL NEVER
BE THE ORDER OF THE DAY.

390
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,708
HARDSHIP AND UGLINESS RULE. AH.

391
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,208
FORGIVE ME, I DO LIKE
TO PRATTLE ON.

392
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,250
OF COURSE YOU KNOW ALL
TOO WELL THE SALIENT FEATURES

393
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,875
OF THE HUMAN RACE.

394
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,958
IF IN SO DOING I HAVE
SPOKEN OUT OF TURN,

395
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,000
I IMPLORE YOUR INDULGENCE.

396
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,125
- I SHOULD OFFER YOU
OUR GRATITUDE.

397
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,125
WITHOUT YOU, WE COULDN'T
HAVE RESCUED KUKU.

398
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,916
- YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THAT I
CAME HERE TO LEND YOU MY AID?

399
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,291
- WELL NO, I'M NOT THAT
MUCH OF AN IDIOT.

400
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,458
EVEN SO, THE TIMING OF
YOUR ATTACK WAS...

401
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,791
WELL, LET'S JUST CALL IT A
VERY HAPPY COINCIDENCE.

402
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,041
- SUCH A PITY.

403
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,416
BUT, YOUR EXISTENCE
PRESENTS MORE QUESTIONS

404
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,208
THAN I'D LIKE TO ANSWER.

405
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,875
IT MAY JUST PROVE EASIER
SIMPLY TO KILL YOU.

406
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,875
- ( gate clangs shut )

407
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,625
- KUKU! WAKE UP!

408
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,083
- ARUA!
( crying )

409
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,708
- SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

410
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,458
- WELL, ONE THING'S FOR SURE.

411
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,500
IT'S FAR TOO
DANGEROUS FOR US

412
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,625
TO BRING THEM
ALONG ON OUR QUEST.

413
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,041
THAT'S IT!

414
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,041
I KNOW JUST THE PLACE
TO TAKE 'EM!

415
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,333
- Ryner: YEAH. PERFECT.

416
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,041
( chuckles smugly )

417
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,416
- IT'S HIGH TIME
TO SET OUT A LIGHT.

418
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,375
- IS THERE NOTHING SO TRIVIAL
THAT YOU WON'T AGONIZE OVER IT?

419
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,041
- TOO MANY THINGS HAVE
BEGUN TO CHANGE.

420
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,083
RUNA IS BEHAVING STRANGELY.

421
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,375
RUMOR HAS IT THAT NELPHA
STANDS ON THE PRECIPICE

422
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,458
OF A VIOLENT REVOLUTION.

423
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:40,166
TOO MANY THINGS CONVERGE
IN FAVOR OF A CONFLICT.

424
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,458
WAR FAST APPROACHES THE
CONDITION OF INEVITABILITY

425
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,708
DESPITE OVERWHELMING
POPULAR OUTCRY AGAINST IT.

426
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:50,125
- WAR IS WAR. PEOPLE ARE
PEOPLE, FOR THAT MATTER.

427
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,916
POPULAR OUTCRY MEANS NOTHING.

428
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,125
HUMANS DESPOIL ONE ANOTHER.

429
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,500
THEY FIGHT TO ESSAY
THEIR IDEALS.

430
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,791
AND THOSE,

431
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,333
REGARDLESS OF SHAPE,
FOUNDATION OR SUBSTANCE,

432
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,666
CONVERGE IN THE PERSON
THE KING.

433
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,875
- AND I WOULD ANSWER
THOSE IDEALS,

434
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,666
FULFILL ALL THEIR HOPES

435
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,375
AND THEIR DREAMS

436
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,875
BY FORGING A WORLD IN WHICH
THE LOWLIEST PERSON

437
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,000
MAY THRIVE.

438
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:13,958
WHERE WAR NEEDN'T BE
THE MEANS TO BRINGING

439
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,333
SUCH IDEALS TO FRUITION.

440
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,750
WHERE, IF ONE SO CHOOSES,

441
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:21,208
AFTERNOON NAPS CAN
BE TAKEN AT LEISURE.

442
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,041
- YOU STILL CLING
TO THE FANTASY?

443
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,833
EVEN KNOWING IT TO BE
THE DREAM OF A MONSTER?

444
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,625
EVEN KNOWING AS YOU DO
THE VISION'S INHERENT FLAW?

445
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,958
- Sion: IT SHOULD STILL
BE IN SIGHT.

446
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,833
I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT
THE GOAL IS AN ILLUSION.

447
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,916
AND YET...

448
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,083
YET...

449
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,041
I'VE A PROMISE TO KEEP.

450
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,791
ONE I DARE NOT
THINK OF FORFEITING,

451
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,875
NOT AND LIVE WITH MYSELF.

452
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,833
IT IS HIGH TIME
TO SET OUT A LIGHT.

453
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,916
YES. A LIGHT.

454
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,708
- ( theme song playing )

455
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,916
- Ryner: YOU KNOW, I JUST
REALIZED SOMETHING.

456
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,958
ALL THESE ROYAL
PAIN-IN-THE-ASS SITUATIONS

457
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,958
I KEEP GETTING THROWN
HEADFIRST INTO ARE JUST THAT.

458
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,083
ROYAL. DAMN YOU, SION!

459
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,083
I SWEAR TO YOU, ONE DAY
YOU'LL KNOW FIRSTHAND

460
