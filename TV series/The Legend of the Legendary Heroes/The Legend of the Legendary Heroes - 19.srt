1
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,083
- Lefahl: SO, WHAT'S
THE SITUATION?

2
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,208
- Rigwalz: IT'S,
UNPLEASANT AT BEST.

3
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,625
IN ALL CORNERS OF MENORIS
MAGIC EYE BEARERS BAND TOGETHER.

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,875
UNDER A DECIDEDLY
ANTI-GASTARKIAN BANNER.

5
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,000
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU
WHO'S BEHIND IT...

6
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,083
- I KNOW YOU'RE THERE.

7
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,875
- ( footsteps approaching )

8
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,125
- Rigwalz: UH, IT'S YOU!

9
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:43,291
- UM, I'M VERY SORRY.
I'M HERE WITHOUT LEAVE.

10
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,458
BUT A GIRL IS ATTRACTED
TO PRECIOUS GEMS,

11
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,041
I JUST COULDN'T RESIST.

12
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:50,375
- YOU'VE EXCELLENT TASTE, BUT
NONE OF THESE WOULD SUIT YOU.

13
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:53,583
IF IT'S GEMSTONES YOU'RE AFTER,
I'LL BUY YOU A TREASURE TROVE.

14
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,333
- I HAVE NO INTEREST IN
ACCEPTING SUCH GIFTS FROM YOU.

15
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,208
( exclaims )

16
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,416
- ( theme song playing )

17
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,958
- NOT HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS, ARE YOU?

18
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,791
- NO, NOT REALLY. I NEVER MUCH
CARED FOR THEIR COUNTRY ANYWAY.

19
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,375
- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT.

20
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:03,333
I'M ASKING IF MEMORIES OF
BEING HUMAN EVER HAUNT YOU?

21
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,333
- WHAT DO YOU
MEAN BY "MEMORIES OF?"

22
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,958
- RYNER, IT DOES NO GOOD
TO GO ON PRETENDING

23
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,291
TO BE WHAT YOU'RE NOT.

24
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,666
CREATURES LIKE US
ARE A BREED APART FROM PEOPLE.

25
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,750
IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO SEE
THAT YOU'RE FOND OF THEM.

26
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,625
BUT DEEP DOWN
YOU KNOW THAT CO-EXISTENCE,

27
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:23,208
ALLURING AS IT MIGHT BE,
IS A PIPE DREAM.

28
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,083
YOU'VE SPENT YOUR LIFE
SEEKING SOMETHING

29
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,291
THAT NO HUMAN CAN GIVE YOU.

30
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,583
THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THEM,
THE MORE IT HURTS.

31
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,541
BUT NO POINT IN
AGONIZING OVER IT.

32
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,375
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
FEEL ALONE NOW.

33
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,125
LET'S MOVE. WE'VE GOT
FRIENDS EXPECTING US.

34
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,375
- I'M SORRY FOR THE WAIT.
- THANK YOU.

35
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,458
PITIFULLY DONE.

36
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,000
THE OUTER TEXTURE
ISN'T PLIANT ENOUGH

37
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,833
FOR THE TEETH TO
SINK INTO PROPERLY.

38
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,666
NOT BOLD ENOUGH
TO BE SWEET OR SALTY.

39
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,500
THE STINK OF OLD FLOUR
IS ABSOLUTELY OVERWHELMING.

40
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,208
I CURSE THE NAME RYNER LUTE!

41
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:10,916
( sighs )

42
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,500
IF HE WERE SITTING BESIDE ME
RIGHT THIS MOMENT,

43
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,041
I'D FORCE THIS ABERRATION
DOWN HIS GULLET.

44
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,000
LIFE IS SO MUCH DULLER
WITHOUT YOU AROUND.

45
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,958
- FOLLOW ME AND I'LL INTRODUCE
YOU TO YOUR NEW FRIENDS.

46
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,250
- DON'T GO.

47
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,541
DON'T GO!

48
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,916
( groans )

49
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,375
BUT, AFTER ALL
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

50
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,500
I THOUGHT I WAS YOUR FRIEND.

51
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,000
- MISS? MISS, WAIT!
YOU'VE LEFT YOUR BACKPACKS!

52
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,666
- Gnubul: AND WHAT PRECISELY
ARE WE TO MAKE OF THIS?

53
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,708
YOUR MAJESTY WAS KNOWINGLY
HARBORING AN ALPHA STIGMA!

54
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,791
YOU CANNOT HAVE BEEN UNAWARE
OF THE GRAVE THREAT

55
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,416
SUCH A CREATURE REPRESENTS TO
THE EXISTENCE OF OUR NATION!

56
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,791
- Sion: AND FOR THE
PRICE OF THAT THREAT

57
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,416
COMES AN INESTIMABLE
RESERVOIR OF POWER.

58
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,375
THE CREATURE UNDERWENT TRAINING
UNDER MY PREDECESSOR'S REIGN.

59
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,875
AND WAS DEEMED BY HIM TO BE THE
GREATEST MAGICIAN OF OUR AGE.

60
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,250
- BUT SURELY, SIR,
POWERFUL MAGICIAN OR NOT...

61
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,958
- INTERESTING. DOES YOUR
MAJESTY MEAN TO SUGGEST

62
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,208
SUCH A CREATURE COULD BE USED
FOR MILITARY PURPOSES?

63
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,791
- NATURALLY.

64
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,333
I WAS AWARE OF THE THREAT
OF HIS GOING OUT OF CONTROL.

65
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,250
I TOOK STEPS TO MONITOR HIM
AND CURTAIL SUCH A HAZARD.

66
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,500
THE TABOO-BREAKER SQUAD WAS
FOUNDED TO OBSERVE HIS BEHAVIOR

67
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,375
AND KEEP ME APPRISED
OF ITS LIKELIHOOD...

68
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:36,500
WITH ORDERS TO TERMINATE HIM
SHOULD HE BEGIN TO LOSE CONTROL

69
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,875
OUR NATION'S HEALTH
WAS MY ONLY CONCERN.

70
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,041
- Gnubul: IN THOSE TERMS,

71
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,000
I BEGIN TO SEE THE WISDOM
OF YOUR ACTIONS.

72
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,500
- OUR OWN MONSTER ON A LEASH.

73
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,000
- I WAS WRONG TO DOUBT
YOUR MAJESTY.

74
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,791
HAVING SUCH A BEAST AT
YOUR BECK AND CALL

75
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,125
IS A TESTAMENT TO YOUR CUNNING.

76
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,458
- Gnubul: HEAR HEAR TO THAT!

77
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,250
- YOU ARE BLAMELESS IN ALL THIS.

78
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,250
YOU'RE MERELY FULFILLING YOUR
DUTIES AS A RULER.

79
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,916
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,416
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. I'D FEEL
THE SAME WAY IF I WERE YOU.

81
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,291
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

82
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,541
- PLEASE UNDERSTAND, GUYS.

83
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,291
IT'S NOT LIKE I HOLD ANYTHING
AGAINST YOU,

84
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,916
IT'S JUST THAT I'VE CAUSED
ENOUGH TROUBLE FOR BOTH OF YOU

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,583
AND YOU DESERVE A BREAK
FROM HAVING TO DEAL WITH ME.

86
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,000
- NO. YOU'RE WRONG.

87
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,208
I AM TO BLAME.

88
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,208
EVERY CRUEL TWIST
IN THIS FARCE

89
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,916
STEMS FROM MY INABILITY
TO REACH YOU.

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS WANT TO BE A PART OF IT.

91
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,416
( laughs ) I'M A FOOL.

92
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,416
I HELD OUT A HAND
IN THE SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP,

93
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,208
AND DESTROYED YOU WITH IT.

94
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,708
( laughs )

95
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:42,000
- YOU'VE GROWN INTO SUCH
AN AMAZING YOUNG MAN ALREADY.

96
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,541
AND I COULDN'T BE
PROUDER OF YOU, MY DARLING.

97
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,666
- IF ONLY THAT WERE
TRUE, MOTHER.

98
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,250
BY NO MEANS AM I A SON
TO BE PROUD OF.

99
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,541
IF YOU COULD SEE ME, YOU'D KNOW.

100
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,583
I'M ALONE.

101
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,833
WHICH IS WHAT I DESERVE.

102
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,000
- Man: SO, CONTINUING WITH
THE PROPOSAL, I ASSUME,

103
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,583
- YOU CAN ASSUME MY COMPLETE
AND UTTER REFUSAL!

104
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,291
- THERE'S NO NEED
TO RAISE YOUR VOICE.

105
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,750
WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED THE
SPECIFICS YET FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE.

106
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,083
- ALL DUE RESPECT, THAT'S NOT
GOING TO CHANGE MY MIND.

107
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,208
- ( door opening )

108
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,791
- WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
- AS LONG AS I DRAW BREATH
THIS WON'T HAPPEN!

110
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,916
I WILL NOT SEE HER
CONJOINED TO OUR KING!

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,583
- WHAT? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

112
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:29,125
- OH, NOTHING. YOU WEAR
THAT DRESS EXQUISITELY, MY DEAR.

113
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,458
- GOOD SHOW.

114
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,375
- EXQUISITELY OR NOT, I DON'T
WEAR IT BY CHOICE.

115
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,583
WHERE HAVE YOU HIDDEN
THE CLOTHES I CAME HERE IN?

116
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,291
- AS GOOD AN OPPORTUNITY AS ANY.

117
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,125
EVERYONE, MEET THE WOMAN
I'M GOING TO MARRY.

118
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,250
- ( exclaims )

119
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,708
- AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.
- MARRY?

120
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,708
- HE'S FINALLY DECIDED TO
SETTLE DOWN. WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT?

121
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,583
- A GOOD MOVE, TO BE SURE, BUT
A BIT SUDDEN DON'T YOU THINK?

122
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,875
- I'M SORRY, I CAN'T ALLOW YOU
TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.

123
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,791
SIR, HER COUNTRY OF ORIGIN IS
A COMPLETE MYSTERY TO US.

124
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,166
- SHE COULD BE AN ENEMY.
- FOR ALL YOU KNOW, I AM.

125
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,083
MORE IMPORTANTLY I DON'T
RECALL HAVING AGREED

126
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,583
TO A PROPOSAL FROM HIS MAJESTY!

127
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,000
- LET'S JUST SKIP TO
WHERE YOU SAY YES.

128
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,583
- YOU AND THAT SENSE OF HUMOR.

129
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,291
- SIR, PLEASE.
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO REASON.

130
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,166
- Kuu: ( shouting )
HELP US, LEFAHL!

131
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:07,833
( crying )

132
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,000
HE'S BEEN WOUNDED, SIR!
HE CAN'T WALK ON HIS OWN!

133
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:19,708
- HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
- OH, NO!

134
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,833
- IT'S NOT AS BAD AS IT LOOKS.

135
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,166
PLEASE TELL KUU TO GO
AND GET SOME REST.

136
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,458
SHE SPENT THE SCYTHE'S POWER
CARRYING ME ALL THE WAY HERE.

137
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,000
IF SHE KEEPS GOING LIKE THIS...

138
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,083
- FETCH THIS MAN
A SURGEON! IMMEDIATELY!

139
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,958
WHO ON EARTH COULD
HAVE DONE THIS TO YOU?

140
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,208
- NOW'S NOT THE TIME
FOR SUCH QUESTIONS.

141
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:43,291
DON'T TALK, SUI. I WANT YOU
TO RESERVE YOUR STRENGTH.

142
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,916
- PLEASE, SIR, IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT I SPEAK BECAUSE...

143
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,958
THIS MAY BE THE LAST TIME I CAN.

144
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,000
- BROTHER, NO!
- HOW DARE YOU TALK LIKE THAT!

145
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,583
DON'T BE ABSURD!
I'M NOT LETTING YOU DIE!

146
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,750
- PLEASE, LIZE.
DON'T LET HER SEE THIS.

147
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,416
- YOUR EXCELLENCY,
CAN I HAVE YOUR DECISION?

148
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,333
- TAKE THE GIRL AWAY.

149
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,041
- ( crying )

150
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,750
- ( thud )

151
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,750
- YOU HELD OUT
AS LONG AS YOU COULD.

152
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,250
REST NOW.

153
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,458
- I'M GRATEFUL TO YOU.

154
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
- Kiefer: THE STRENGTH
OF THESE PEOPLE.

155
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:30,333
READY TO CAST THEIR LIVES
INTO OBLIVION FOR THEIR COUNTRY.

156
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,791
AND A KING PREPARED TO
SACRIFICE HIMSELF PIECE BY PIECE

157
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,833
TO MOVE THE PEOPLE FORWARD.

158
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,291
- WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE, SUI?
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

159
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:44,250
- I GROSSLY UNDERESTIMATED
A RULE FRAGMENT USER.

160
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,333
THE ONE HE HAD RESEMBLED BROTHER
LIR'S LIGHTING BEAST RING,

161
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,666
BUT...

162
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,291
- WHAT COUNTRY WAS HE FROM?
- I DON'T KNOW, SIR.

163
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,375
BUT IN ROLAND
THEY HAVE A MONSTER.

164
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:58,291
A VERY POWERFUL MAGICIAN THEY'RE
USING AS A WEAPON, RYNER LUTE.

165
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,375
- ( exclaims )

166
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,416
- AT FIRST GLANCE HE LOOKS LIKE
ANY OTHER ALPHA STIGMA.

167
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,916
BUT HIS CAPACITY FOR
DESTRUCTION FAR EXCEEDS

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,583
ANYTHING I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED.

169
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,750
PLEASE, PROMISE ME
YOU'LL FIGURE OUT

170
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,250
WHO OR WHAT THIS MAN REALLY IS.

171
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,208
- SIR, THIS WOMAN
IS FAMILIAR WITH HIM.

172
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,500
SHE NOTICEABLY BALKED JUST NOW
AT THE MENTION OF HIS NAME.

173
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:46,708
- Tiir: ARE YOU NOT HUNGRY
OR DO YOU JUST NOT LIKE THESE?

174
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,375
- SORRY, NOT A FAN OF DANGO.

175
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,000
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT ON
A BRAVE FACE AROUND ME.

176
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,625
I REALIZE IT HURTS.

177
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:58,375
THE PLIGHT OF SOMEONE LIKE YOU
BEGINS THE MOMENT YOU'RE BORN.

178
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,625
YOU COME INTO THIS
WORLD AS A HUMAN,

179
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,583
AND GET BRAINWASHED
FOR THE TROUBLE.

180
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,208
YOU LOVE PEOPLE,
GIVE THEM YOUR ALL,

181
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,875
BUT ALWAYS END UP
THE SAME WAY.

182
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,041
BETRAYED.

183
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,125
- WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE
OF THE WORLD SO DIFFERENT?

184
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,250
- IN A WAY.

185
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,625
IINO DUOE WAKE UP TO
THEMSELVES EARLIER

186
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,833
THAN OTHER MAGIC EYES, YOU SEE.

187
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,083
MY EYE OPENED
BEFORE I WAS EVEN BORN.

188
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,916
EVEN IN THE DEPTH
OF MY MOTHER'S WOMB

189
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,250
I HEARD A VOICE CALLING TO ME.

190
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,291
THE VOICE FILLED ME
WITH DARK IDEAS,

191
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,875
AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO COULD HEAR IT.

192
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,541
- Alpha Stigma: THE WORLD
IS YOUR PLAYGROUND.

193
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:33,083
GIVE NO QUARTER.
SHOW NO MERCY.

194
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,625
RELEASE IT. DESTROY IT.

195
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:39,500
- THE VOICE COMMANDED ME TO ACT.
IT LED ME TO MY FIRST FEEDING.

196
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,458
COMPELLED ME TO EAT
THE WRETCHED WOMAN

197
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,708
WHO'D GIVEN BIRTH TO ME.

198
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,625
SO FROM THE VERY START...

199
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,250
YOU THINK OF ME
AS A MONSTER, TOO DON'T YOU?

200
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,583
- NO, I DON'T.

201
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,708
- THE DOUBT AND SELF-LOATHING
INSTILLED IN YOU FROM CHILDHOOD

202
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,833
ARE STILL THRASHING
UNDER THE SURFACE.

203
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,791
BUT YOU'RE BETTER THAN THE
PEOPLE WHO PLANTED THOSE IDEAS.

204
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,916
HUMAN BEINGS CAN ONLY DREAM
OF THE KIND OF POWER WE HAVE.

205
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,625
- IT'S A REPORT I MANAGED TO
DRUDGE UP ABOUT RYNER LUTE.

206
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,125
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST I'M
STILL HAVING A BIT OF TROUBLE

207
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,208
ACCEPTING THE FACT THAT

208
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,375
SION WAS KEEPING
AN ALPHA STIGMA ON HAND.

209
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,500
- YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE,
BELIEVE ME.

210
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,958
STILL, DON'T MOST OF THOSE GUYS
WIND UP GOING OUT OF CONTROL

211
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,416
AND HAVING TO BE PUT DOWN?

212
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,083
- TRUE, BUT OUR FRIEND HERE
BELONGS TO A SPECIAL TYPE.

213
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,000
THEY ERUPT INTO A
FRENZY OF DESTRUCTION,

214
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,625
BUT SNAP OUT OF IT,
UNLIKE THE OTHERS.

215
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,291
- THEY CALL HIM RYNER LUTE,
BUT HIS NAME, BIRTH DATE,

216
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,375
PLACE OF ORIGIN AND
BASICALLY ALL THE ESSENTIALS

217
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,375
ARE STILL UNCLEAR.

218
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,125
IT'S PRESUMED HE WAS TAKEN
IN BY A VILLAGE OF SCAVENGERS

219
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,458
AT THE AGE OF FIVE, WHERE
THE FIRST SIGN OF HIS POWER

220
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,416
AS AN ALPHA STIGMA
CAME TO LIGHT.

221
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,041
AFTER THAT HE WAS
TAKEN INTO MILITARY CUSTODY.

222
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,750
HE UNDERWENT A COMBAT REGIMEN

223
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,875
AT THE GERMER KLEISMORE
TRAINING INSTITUTE,

224
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,583
AND NOT LONG AFTERWARDS
WAS SHIPPED OFF

225
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,916
TO ROLAND SPECIAL TRAINING
INSTITUTE NUMBER THREE-O-SEVEN.

226
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,416
NO PICNIC, THAT.

227
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,458
HE WAS THEN ENLISTED INTO
A SECRET MILITARY ORGANIZATION.

228
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,750
THEY DUBBED HIM
ROLAND'S DEADLIEST MAGICIAN.

229
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,833
- Calne: WHICH IS STRANGE,
BECAUSE ALL TOLD

230
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,208
HE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE HANDLED
HIS MISSIONS VERY WELL.

231
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,791
HE WAS PRONE TO DESERTION,

232
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,916
TIME AGAIN CARELESSLY
LEAKED VITAL INFORMATION,

233
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
SMARTED OFF
TO SUPERIOR OFFICERS...

234
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,833
- Claugh: SO WE CAN ASSUME
THEY HAD SURVEILLANCE

235
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,250
AT LEAST PARTIALLY IN MIND

236
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,000
WHEN DROPPING HIM OFF
AT THE ROLAND SPECIAL ACADEMY.

237
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,916
- Calne: OF COURSE. AND THAT'S
WHERE HE FIRST MET SION.

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,625
GIVEN HIS HISTORY
IT'S ASTONISHING

239
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:44,208
THIS GUY HADN'T TURNED ON
THE COUNTRY LONG BEFORE NOW.

240
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,708
- IT'S FUNNY. I'VE SEEN A LOT OF
GUYS LIKE HIM GET CHEWED UP

241
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,291
AND SPAT OUT BY THE SYSTEM.

242
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,875
THEIR TAKE ON LIFE ISN'T EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'D CALL A BED OF ROSES.

243
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,083
THEY DEVELOP A TALENT

244
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,625
FOR BEARING THE PAIN
THEY'VE GONE THROUGH,

245
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,083
BY DEADENING THEMSELVES
TO EVERYTHING.

246
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,166
THEY CONVINCE THEMSELVES THAT
NOTHING CAN CHANGE,

247
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,208
SO WHAT'S THE POINT?
NONE OF IT MATTERS.

248
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,916
BUT, THEN AGAIN MAYBE I DON'T
KNOW THE FIRST DAMN THING

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
ABOUT WHAT THE KID'S
GOING THROUGH.

250
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,791
- THIS IS IT, HUH?
- IT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY SHELTER.

251
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:21,000
WE'LL MOVE ON TO SOMETHING MORE
ACCOMMODATING IN A FEW DAYS.

252
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,958
- HEY! TIIR'S COME
BACK, YOU GUYS!

253
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,083
- WHAT THE HELL?

254
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,708
- Girl: YOU SURE TOOK YOUR TIME.

255
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,333
- Boy: YEAH! WE'VE BEEN
WAITING ON YOU FOR FOREVER!

256
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,083
- Tiir: I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

257
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,500
BUT YOU'VE ALL BEEN GOOD
WHILE I WAS GONE, HAVEN'T YOU?

258
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,916
- YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT!

259
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,125
- TELL US WHERE YOU WENT!
- OH, SUPER-EXTRA GOOD!

260
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:40,750
- EIGHTEEN, NINETEEN, TWENTY,
TWENTY-ONE, TWENTY TWO...

261
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,250
- THERE YOU GO.

262
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,416
- THANKS.

263
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,708
- Girl: MY TURN.

264
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,333
SO ARE ALL THESE KIDS,
YOU KNOW, LIKE WE ARE?

265
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,625
- Children: ONE, TWO...
- YES.

266
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,041
EVERY CHILD YOU SEE HERE
BEARS A MAGIC EYE.

267
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,750
THEY'VE BEEN HUNTED
DOWN BY HUMANS

268
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,291
FOR THE GIFTS GOD'S GIVEN THEM.

269
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,958
LIKE US, THEY'RE LUCKY
TO HAVE SURVIVED THIS LONG.

270
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,166
- LIGHTNING BEASTS!

271
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:06,666
( yells )

272
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,041
( groans )

273
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,166
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

274
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,083
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW
EVEN AN IINO DUOE

275
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,833
CAN'T CONSUME A LIGHTNING BEAST.

276
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,875
- SHEESH! DON'T PLAY
TOO ROUGH WITH HIM.

277
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,583
IF YOU KILL HIM OUTRIGHT
WE CAN'T EXTRACT HIS CRYSTAL.

278
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,291
- THIS WILL BE OUR
SEVENTY-SIXTH EXTRACTION.

279
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,375
- Lir: PERSONALLY, I DON'T
COUNT THEM UNTIL THEY'RE DEAD.

280
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,833
- ( girl crying )

281
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,500
- Tiir: THIRTY-EIGHT PEOPLE
WERE MURDERED THAT DAY.

282
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,375
MANY OF THEM CHILDREN.

283
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:40,000
YET BY SOME LOGIC WE'RE
THE MONSTERS IN ALL OF THIS.

284
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,083
THE ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
SLAUGHTER WERE FROM GASTARK.

285
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,458
- GASTARK, BUT...

286
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,625
- THAT COUNTRY WILL PAY
FOR WHAT IT'S DONE.

287
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,250
THE LOWLY WRETCHES WHO DARED
MAKE A MOVE AGAINST US

288
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,708
DON'T KNOW PAIN.

289
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,041
BUT MARK MY WORDS
THEY SOON WILL.

290
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,791
- TIIR! CAN WE EAT NOW?
I'M HUNGRY!

291
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,000
- AND I'M STARVING.

292
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,916
- WHERE ARE MY MANNERS?
IS IT TIME ALREADY?

293
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,458
- ( children laughing )

294
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,625
- IF YOU UNDERSTAND
NOTHING ELSE ABOUT ME,

295
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:09,083
KNOW ALL I WANT IS A WORLD WHERE
THESE CHILDREN CAN BE HAPPY.

296
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,458
I'LL NEED AN ALLY LIKE YOU

297
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,583
TO HELP ME MAKE THAT
WORLD A REALITY.

298
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,916
GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT, RYNER.

299
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,125
- ( children laughing )

300
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,416
- SO, ARE YOU LIKE A NEW FRIEND
FOR US TO PLAY WITH, OR WHAT?

301
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,708
- UH, WELL...
- WHAT'S YOUR SPECIAL TECHNIQUE?

302
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:27,208
- HUH? NOT ONE TO
BEAT AROUND THE BUSH, I SEE.

303
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,208
I DO TAKE LOTS OF NAPS.

304
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,291
- All: WHAT YOU MEAN
IS THAT YOU'RE LAZY.

305
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,500
- HUH?

306
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,041
- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH AFTERNOON NAPS.

307
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,375
- All: WELCOME HOME, LAFRA!

308
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,541
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK. I'M A
FAN OF AFTERNOON NAPS, TOO.

309
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,250
- WELCOME HOME, LAFRA.

310
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,583
EVERYTHING PLAYED OUT EXACTLY
AS YOU SAID IT WOULD.

311
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,458
I FOUND HIM IN A TAVERN.

312
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,541
- I'VE WAITED TO SAY THIS
FOR SOME TIME.

313
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,375
WELCOME HOME,
BROTHER LUTE.

314
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,708
MY EYE IS KNOWN AS EBBRA CRYPT.

315
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,833
IT REPLACES THE DREAMS IN MY
HEAD WITH THOSE OF OTHER PEOPLE.

316
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,083
ESSENTIALLY, MY POWER
RESONATES THROUGH DREAMS.

317
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,583
IT GIVES ME A FIRST PERSON VIEW

318
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,208
OF WHAT'S GOING ON
INSIDE THEIR HEARTS.

319
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,875
- YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'VE SEEN MY DREAMS?

320
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,750
- COME NOW.
I'M BEING CAUTIOUS.

321
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,583
YOU'VE A TALENT
FOR IMPROBABLE DREAMS.

322
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,541
SORRY. I FORGET
HOW SHOCKING THAT CAN BE.

323
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,583
I ONLY SEE BITS AND PIECES.

324
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,875
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME.
- HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

325
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,083
SO. THAT'S HOW YOU
TRACKED ME DOWN, HUH?

326
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,958
- YES, IT IS. DON'T TAKE
THIS THE WRONG WAY

327
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,166
BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT I'VE
BEEN KEEPING AN EYE ON YOU

328
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,625
FOR SOME TIME.

329
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,625
NOT EVEN TIIR KNOW HOW LONG.
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE.

330
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,500
- AND WHY NOT?

331
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,291
- BECAUSE THERE WAS
SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT YOU.

332
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,666
AS BEARERS OF THE MAGIC EYE GO,

333
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,416
YOU'RE SO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
FROM THE REST OF US.

334
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,750
I WAS FASCINATED.

335
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,791
FOR ONE THING YOU'RE
EXTREMELY KINDHEARTED.

336
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,458
I CAN TELL BY
HOW MUCH PAIN YOU FEEL.

337
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:56,375
THE MORE I WATCHED YOUR DREAMS,
THE MORE MY HEART BROKE FOR YOU.

338
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,583
YOU FELT LOST.
ABANDONED, BETRAYED.

339
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,000
THE WORLD'S HANDLED YOU
POORLY, AND LIKE ANYONE,

340
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,708
BECAUSE OF IT YOU'VE RESIGNED
TO BEING ALONE.

341
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,458
YOU'RE AFRAID OF PEOPLE.

342
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,083
AFRAID OF GETTING HURT.
WISHING YOU WERE DEAD.

343
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,083
OR BETTER YET, INSANE.

344
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:18,500
YOU WERE HAUNTED. TORMENTED.
FEELINGS WE ALL KNOW TOO WELL.

345
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:22,083
AND YET, AS STRONG AS
ALL THOSE HORRIBLE THINGS WERE,

346
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,500
WHAT CAME RINGING THROUGH
DESPITE THEM WAS THE FACT

347
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,291
THAT YOU LOVE PEOPLE.

348
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,166
WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE,
YOUR FIRST INSTINCT, ALWAYS,

349
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,416
IS TO PROTECT OTHERS.

350
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,041
THAT MAKES BEING ALONE
THAT MUCH HARDER.

351
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,708
YOU HATE IT. YOU WANT TO
BE WITH PEOPLE. YOU CRAVE IT.

352
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,916
EVEN DWELLING AS YOU DO ON
HOW MUCH OF A "MONSTER" YOU ARE,

353
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,833
EVEN AS SCARED AS YOU ARE
OF HURTING OTHERS,

354
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:46,458
YOU'LL NEVER SILENCE THE PART
OF YOU THAT LONGS FOR THEM.

355
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:50,208
YOU'RE GOOD, BUT AFRAID.
LOVING, BUT LONELY.

356
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,708
AND HONESTLY?
YOUR DREAMS MAKE ME SAD.

357
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,791
- DO ME A FAVOR, KID.
DON'T SAY THIS STUFF

358
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,666
LIKE YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S GOT A RIGHT TO CRY.

359
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,708
- ( laughs )

360
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,083
- WHERE DO YOU GET OFF
TELLING A PERSON LIKE ME

361
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,875
WHAT HE DOES AND DOESN'T FEEL?

362
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,500
SPARE ME THE
PENETRATING INSIGHTS

363
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,875
AND JUST ADMIT THAT WE'RE REALLY
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

364
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:11,291
- OF COURSE, THAT'S WHY
I CALLED YOU HERE.

365
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,458
I'M LOOKING FOR SALVATION.

366
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,208
- WHAT IN THE HELL
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

367
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,041
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

368
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,666
LOOK AT TIIR,
AND THE CHILDREN.

369
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,333
THINK ABOUT ALL
OF OUR FRIENDS

370
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,708
SCATTERED TO THE FAR
CORNERS OF MENORIS.

371
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,291
MOST OF ALL, CONSIDER YOURSELF.

372
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,125
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHOSE GIFT FROM GOD

373
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,208
COST HIM HIS FAITH IN HUMANITY.

374
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,125
I WANT YOU TO SAVE THEM,
RYNER LUTE.

375
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,416
ALL OF THEM.

376
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,958
BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING
I CAN'T DO.

377
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,666
- ( children clamoring )

378
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,125
- YOU NEED YOUR STRENGTH,
LAF. DIG IN.

379
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,500
- WHY THANK YOU, PUEKA.

380
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,666
- HEY! NO FAIR! HOW COME HE
GETS ALL THE ATTENTION?

381
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,583
- 'CAUSE SISTER PUEKA LOVES
BROTHER LAFRA, THAT'S HOW COME!

382
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,875
- YEAH!
- Children: PUEKA LOVES LAFRA!

383
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:07,500
- Lafra: CHILDREN, THAT IS NOT
APPROPRIATE TABLE CONVERSATION!

384
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,583
- ( all laughing )

385
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,250
- THINK THESE ARE
A GIFT FROM GOD?

386
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,291
- RYNER, IT DOES NO
GOOD TO GO ON

387
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,125
PRETENDING TO BE
WHAT YOU'RE NOT.

388
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,458
CREATURES LIKE US ARE
A BREED APART FROM PEOPLE.

389
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,750
- IS THAT REALLY TRUE?

390
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:36,166
IF SO, THEN CALLING US MONSTERS
WOULDN'T BE FAR OFF THE MARK.

391
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,833
IS CO-EXISTENCE
SUCH A PIPE DREAM?

392
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,750
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF ALL THIS, THEN?

393
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,875
NOT A DAMN THING HAS CHANGED.

394
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,500
WE DIDN'T CHOOSE
TO BE BORN THIS WAY.

395
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,458
WE DIDN'T CHOOSE
TO BE BORN DEMONS.

396
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,833
- THEY'RE MONSTERS WHOSE VERY
EXISTENCE BREEDS DESTRUCTION!

397
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,916
- ( sighs )

398
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,750
- Lafra: YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
ONE WHOSE GIFT FROM GOD

399
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,000
COST HIM HIS FAITH IN HUMANITY.

400
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,250
I WANT YOU TO SAVE THEM,
RYNER LUTE.

401
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,458
- HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO SAVE ANYONE?

402
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,833
I'M A CURSED THING.

403
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,708
A MONSTER.

404
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,708
I RUIN EVERYTHING I TOUCH.

405
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,708
THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH THEM.

406
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,833
THEY'RE SHUNNED JUST
BECAUSE OF THEIR EYES.

407
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,000
THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.

408
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,750
WHAT DOES THAT SAY
ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO JUDGE THEM?

409
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,750
WHY WOULD WE
WANT TO CO-EXIST?

410
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,166
I CAN SEE YOU.

411
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,125
- ( leaves rustling )

412
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,583
- AS I EXPECTED.

413
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,791
ROLAND'S DEADLIEST MAGICIAN
WOULDN'T DESERVE THE NAME

414
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,833
IF HE COULDN'T FERRET OUT
AN INTERLOPER.

415
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,333
- WHO ARE YOU?

416
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,583
- I AM AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER

417
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,916
IN ROLAND'S ELITE
TABOO-BREAKER SQUAD.

418
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,708
SERGEANT LUKE STOKKART
AT YOUR SERVICE, SIR.

419
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,666
I'VE COME HERE TONIGHT
BY ORDER OF HIS MAJESTY.

420
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,208
HOW DO I PUT THIS? I'VE COME
TO KILL YOU, RYNER LUTE.

421
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,750
- ( theme song playing )

422
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,125
- Ryner: THE WHOLE REASON
I LEFT ROLAND IN THE FIRST PLACE

423
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,958
WAS TO MAKE LIFE
SUCK A LITTLE LESS

424
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,625
FOR THE PEOPLE I CARED ABOUT.

425
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,291
FAT LOT OF GOOD THAT DID.

426
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:49,750
DAMN IT! WHY THE HELL DO
THINGS ALWAYS END UP THIS WAY?

427
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:52,791
I DIDN'T WANT THIS!
NOBODY WANTED THIS!
