8
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,541
OR THE BOUGHT-AND-PAID FOR
PLEASURE CHILD

00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,416
OF SOME ESTABULIAN FOP?

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,708
BECAUSE IT DOES.

20
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,916

21
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,291
- HEY, COME ON!

22
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,750
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
STOP TRYING TO HIT ME

23
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,250
EVERY TIME I'M
WITHIN FIVE FEET?

24
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,875
- HANDS OFF, VILE THING!

25
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,958
I DON'T INTEND TO HAVE MY
VIRTUE FOREVER RUINED BY YOU!

26
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,833
- OH, RIGHT... FERRIS PUT
THE IDEA IN YOUR HEAD

27
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,416
THAT THE SLIGHTEST BRUSH
WITH YOURS TRULY

28
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,083
BURDENS A GIRL WITH CHILD...

29
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:34,333
RELAX OKAY, NOT EVERYTHING
SHE SAYS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

30
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,833
( gasps )

31
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,250
- YET, YOU CLUTCH HER ARM
FOR NO REASON I CAN DISCERN.

32
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,375
- LOOK I'M NOT ABDUCTING,
IMPREGNATING

33
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,416
OR OTHERWISE CORRUPTING
YOUR PRECIOUS BABY SISTER

34
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,291
IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM, OKAY?

35
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,125
YOU KNOW,

36
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,833
I THINK IT SPEAKS TO HOW FAR
WE'VE COME IN THIS RELATIONSHIP

37
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,750
THAT I'M ACTUALLY STARTING TO
FEEL YOUR EYES BORE A HOLE

38
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,416
IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD.

39
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,291
- BIG SISTER FERRIS!

40
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,583
- HOW LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

41
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,541
SO THERE WAS NO
MISADVENTURE EN ROUTE?

42
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,458
- NOPE! I MISSED YOU,

43
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,875
SO I DIDN'T WASTE A
SINGLE MOMENT GETTING HERE.

44
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:06,625
I DO GOOD? TELL ME, I...

45
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,541
- YOU DID.
- HEY, EASY!

46
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,666
- OH, I'M SORRY.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

47
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,875
IRIS IS ALL WORKED UP,

48
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,875
SO I'M JUST COAXING
HER INTO A LITTLE NAP.

49
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,666
- THIS IS THE WAY YOU COAX HER?

50
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,958
- ( chuckles )

51
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,958
COME ON, MY BROTHER
DID THE SAME THING FOR ME

52
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,791
WHEN I WAS A CHILD,
NOW I DO IT FOR HER.

53
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,708
- HOW THE HELL'D YOU
SURVIVE BEING A KID?

54
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,083
- AH, EXCELLENT...

55
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,458
WYNNIT TEA HOUSE DANGO

56
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,666
WILL MAKE THIS A VERY
GOOD MORNING INDEED.

57
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,125
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. YOUR
LITTLE SISTER'S CRUMPLED IN

58
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:45,291
A HEAP ON THE FLOOR AND YOU'RE
CHOWING DOWN ON PREMIUM DANGO.

59
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,791
- IRIS HAS REACHED THEM
BY NOW, HOPEFULLY...

60
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,958
IF IT WASN'T TOO LATE.

61
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,458
- YOU'RE SO RIGHT!
THIS STUFF IS GOOD!

62
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,833
- SEE?

63
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,625
- YOU'VE BOTH BEEN HOARDING
OVER THAT DANGO LIKE MAD

64
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,125
ALL MORNING.

65
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:06,166
SURELY THAT'S NOT THE ONLY
REASON YOU CAME HERE, IRIS...

66
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,083
- HUH? WELL NO...
I MEAN... I THINK...

67
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,875
- OF COURSE!
I BROUGHT A LETTER!

68
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,375
- YOU MEAN FROM SION?

69
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,250
- YEAH, I CARRIED IT HERE ALL
THE WAY FROM THE PALACE...

70
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,041
HIS MAJESTY TOLD ME
TO DELIVER IT

71
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,666
AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE,
IF NOT FASTER...

72
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,958
THERE WAS SOME REALLY IMPORTANT
INFORMATION IN IT, SO...

73
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,541
- WELL HERE, LET ME GET IT.
- IF YOU MUST.

74
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,833
- HUH. OKAY, THAT'S
A LITTLE BIT WEIRD.

75
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,083
IF I TUCKED IT AWAY
WHERE IT'D BE SAFE...

76
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,166
'CAUSE OF HOW
REALLY IMPORTANT IT WAS...

77
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,791
THEN WHERE'S THE STUPID THING
NOW? IT'S GOTTA BE IN HERE.

78
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,041
- I DON'T SUPPOSE
HE ACTUALLY TOLD YOU

79
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,833
WHAT THE LETTER WAS ABOUT?

80
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,791
- UM, WELL...

81
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,500
I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT
A BIG DRAGON BEING ON THE LOOSE.

82
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,166
- IS THAT A FACT?
- IS THAT A FACT?

83
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,500
- OH, YES. OF COURSE.

84
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,833
THE WORTHLESS CREATURE
YOUR RELIC SET FREE.

85
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,708
SION MUST WANT US TO TRACK
DOWN ITS WHEREABOUTS

86
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,333
AND TRY TO REIGN IT IN.

87
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,583
- AW MAN, WHY US?

88
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,333
- THAT SOUNDS
ABOUT RIGHT, BUT...

89
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,333
I DON'T KNOW, I'M PRETTY SURE
THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE

90
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,166
REALLY CRUCIAL MIXED IN THERE...

91
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,375
- DON'T WORRY, SIS.

92
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,583
WE'LL JUST FIGURE THINGS
OUT AS WE GO ALONG.

93
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,291
- UH, WE WILL?

94
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,041
YOU KNOW, THAT SUDDENLY
SOUNDS LIKE A WONDERFUL IDEA...

95
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,500
- ALRIGHT THEN.

96
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,625
GO BACK HOME AND TELL HIS
MAJESTY WE'LL DO AS HE ASKS.

97
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,583
- I'M ON THE JOB!

98
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,250
- ( yawning )

99
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,333
- Landlady: HMM. WHAT'S THIS?

- NOW THAT I CAN GET BEHIND.

110
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,208
I MOVE THAT WE LEAVE OFF
THE INVESTIGATION ENTIRELY

UNTIL WE'VE HAD
SOME REFRESHMENT.

112

- COULD THE DRAGON
HAVE DONE THIS?

113

- Ferris: LET'S FIND OUT.

114
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:37,750
RYNER, NO BLOOD
HAS BEEN SPILLED.

115

- YEAH. OTHERWISE WE'D HAVE
PROBABLY BEEN ABLE TO SMELL

THIS PLACE LONG
BEFORE WE FOUND IT.

117
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,583
WHAT HAPPENED TO THESE PEOPLE?

118
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,916
- DOWN THERE.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,875
- HELLO! EXCUSE US...

YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME...

- THERE'S SOMEONE COMING,

122
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,166
IT LOOKS LIKE THE MYSTERIOUS
MISSIONARIES FROM NELPHA.

123
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,375
- WELL, OUR PATHS
CROSS YET AGAIN.

00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,958
WHAT A SERENDIPITOUS SURPRISE.

125
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,166
- WHAT ARE THE
TWO OF YOU DOING HERE?

126
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,375
- TRYING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF
THE RUMORED DRAGON, OF COURSE.

127
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,541
- SUCH A UNIQUE SIGHT WOULD

ASSUREDLY LIGHT MY
WRITER'S QUILL AFIRE.

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,250
I IMAGINE A YOUNG PRINCESS

00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,375
WRITHING IN ITS
CLUTCHES. HELPLESS...

131
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,916

SHINING ARMOR THEN RIDES TO

HER RESCUE ON A GREAT
WHITE STEED AND FELLS THE

133
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,250
INFERNAL BEAST WITH A
FLICK OF HIS SHINING BLADE.

134
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,666
CLICHES LIKE THAT
BAR YOUR WRITING

135
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,166
FROM THE POPULAR MARKET,
YOU KNOW!

SO, WHAT DO YOU TWO
THINK'S GOING ON HERE?

137
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,750
- HEY, YOUR GUESS

138
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,750
IT'S WEIRD THERE BEING NO
TELLTALE SIGNS OF BLOOD, BUT...

139

FERRIS?

140
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,291
- PERHAPS YOU TWO HAVE
YOUR OWN THEORY

141
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,291
AS TO THE NATURE OF THIS BEAST?

142
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,291
- YOUR EYE IS AS SHARP
AS YOUR DRESS, MY LADY.

143
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,958
- DID YOU KILL THEM?

144
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,000
- WE WERE INTERESTED IN THE
HIDDEN RICHES IN THE FORTRESS

145
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,208
FOR MUCH THE SAME
REASON YOU WERE,

146
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,083
IF I'M NOT BEING TOO
VAGUE ON THE MATTER.

147
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,541
- SO YOU'RE OUT TO
FIND HERO RELICS AS WELL.

148
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,625
YOU'VE BEEN TAILING US
TO SAVE THE TROUBLE

149
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,833
OF HAVING TO LOCATE
THEM YOURSELVES.

150
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,041
- THAT ABOUT RIGHT?
- BRAVO.

151
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,500
WE CAN'T TAKE ALL THE CREDIT
FOR OUR SUCCESS, THOUGH,

152
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,791
THE TABOO BREAKER
SQUADRON HELPED IMMENSELY.

153
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,625
AS DID OF COURSE YOUR
INHERENT CLUMSINESS

154
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,750
IN LEAVING THIS
RELIC FOR US TO FIND.

155
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,583
WE WERE EXTREMELY LUCKY...

156
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,625
IT WAS, AS THE
OLD SAYING GOES,

157
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,875
A PERFECT STORM
OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

158
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,083
- YOU'RE A MURDERER...

159
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,125
- ( laughs )

160
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,666
- Ryner: YOU SLAUGHTERED
ANY POOR JERK

161
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,166
HAPLESS ENOUGH TO
HAVE SEEN THE DRAGON.

162
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,500
AND ALL JUST TO KEEP
A USELESS RELIC A SECRET.

163
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,916
- Sui: WELL, IT IS EASIER TO
HARNESS A RELIC'S POWER

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,208
WHEN YOU'RE NOT WRENCHING
IT FROM THE RABBLE,

165
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,291
WHICH, I'M SORRY TO SAY...

166
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,041
INCLUDES THE TWO OF YOU.

167
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,708
- IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE A THREAT?

168
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,000
- Ferris: WHAT'S YOUR GOAL?

169
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,541
EXACTLY WHO AND WHAT

170
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,000
ARE YOU TRYING TO
COLLECT THE RELICS FOR?

171
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,958
- BIT OF AN INVOLVED QUESTION
FOR SOMEONE ABOUT TO DIE.

172
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,333
YOU'RE TRYING TO BUY
TIME, AREN'T YOU?

173
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,250
- PERHAPS... I CAN HARDLY
BE BLAMED FOR IT.

174
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,375
FORTUNATELY, IT'S AN EASY ENOUGH
MATTER TO DEDUCE WHAT COUNTRY

175
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,291
YOU'RE AFFILIATED WITH.

176
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,916
- I OFFER UP A CONTRACT TO BEAR
THE WICKED SPIRIT BEAST

177
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,666
THAT SLEEPS WITHIN THE EARTH!

178
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,583
- A SPELL TO INCREASE
YOUR INNATE PHYSICAL PROWESS?

179
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,041
I ADMIRE THE SWIFTNESS...

180
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,791
FROM THE WEST I DRAW THE
EMPTY, THE FORMATION, THE YANG!

181
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,583
- THE EMPTY, THE FORMATION,
THE YANG!

182
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,250
- AN ALPHA STIGMA!
I SUMMON FORTH THE BRILLIANCE!

183
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,166
HE JUMPED MY INVOCATION!
WATCH OUT!

184
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,875
- ( grunting )

185
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,791
- CRAP!

186
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,916
- IT'S NICE TO KNOW
MY LOOKS DISTRACT YOU

187
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,541
EVEN IN THE MIDST OF BATTLE.

188
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,041
BUT SURELY FOCUSING
ON OUR OPPONENTS

189
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,458
WOULD BE A BETTER TACTIC?

190
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,916
- WHAT THE HELL
IS YOUR PROBLEM?

191
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,291
YOU DO KNOW THESE
FREAKS WANT TO MURDER US.

192
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,750
- NO POINT SURRENDERING
OUR SENSE OF HUMOR.

193
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,500
- IS ALL OF THIS A JOKE TO YOU?

194
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,000
- NOT THE PART WHERE YOU
DEFLECTED THE AFTERSHOCKS

195
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,041
OF A HIT THAT WOULD'VE
OTHERWISE KILLED ME, NO.

196
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,791
- ( sighs )

197
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,333
RIGHT. SO LOOK OUT
FOR THE SCYTHE.

198
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,666
- THAT'S A RELIC TOO THEN,
I TAKE IT?

199
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,250
- YEAH. ONE THAT APPEARS
TO RAISE ITS USER'S

200
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,166
NATURAL ABILITIES BY A PRETTY
DAMN SIGNIFICANT MARGIN.

201
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,291
- AND...

202
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,250
- WELL, GUESS THAT EXPLAINS
WHY NONE OF THE BODIES

203
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,250
SHOWED ANY SIGNS OF TRAUMA.

204
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,125
AND WHERE THAT SUDDEN
WALL OF ICE EMERGED FROM.

205
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,083
- A SWORD WEIGHED DOWN WITH
ICE GETS TOO HEAVY TO USE...

206
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,750
THAT, AND AS THE
TEMPERATURE PLUMMETS,

207
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,333
IT'S HARDER TO STAY NIMBLE.

208
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,000
- ALRIGHT THEN...

209
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,458
I'LL CREATE AN OPENING
WITH A GOOD OLD FASHIONED

210
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,166
BOUT OF FIRE MAGIC AND YOU GET
THE SCYTHE OUT OF HER HANDS.

211
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,791
SOUND LIKE A PLAN?

212
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,166
- ONE I'M GLAD TO BE PART OF.

213
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,416
- FORMED AN ATTACK
STRATEGY HAVE WE?

214
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,541
- Ryner: YEAH.
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT.

215
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,458
- THEN THIS SHOULD BE FUN.

216
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,958
IN ALL SERIOUSNESS,
IT'D HARDLY BE WORTH GOUGING

217
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,041
THE ALPHA STIGMA OUT OF YOU

218
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,291
IF YOU DIDN'T STRUGGLE
A LITTLE BIT...

219
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,458
- WORRY NOT, I'LL CRYSTALLIZE
IT TO KEEP IT IN MINT CONDITION.

220
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,625
- CRYSTALLIZE?

221
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,416
- OF COURSE. THAT'S HOW AN
ALPHA STIGMA IS CONTAINED.

222
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,041
DIDN'T YOU KNOW?

223
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,500
- I WOULDN'T BOTHER
PLAYING DUMB IF I DID.

224
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,041
IS IT POSSIBLE THIS GUY
ACTUALLY KNOWS MORE

225
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,500
ABOUT MY ABILITIES THAN I DO?

226
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:27,750
- CAN ONE TRULY BE SO IN THE
DARK ABOUT HIS OWN POWERS?

227
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,666
I SUPPOSE IT'S TO BE
EXPECTED OF A MAGE

228
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,041
PRONE TO OVERLOOK
A RULE FRAGMENT.

229
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,958
- WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?

230
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,875
- THERE IS SO MUCH
YOU DON'T KNOW...

231
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,541
HERE, LET ME BEGIN
BY ILLUSTRATING

232
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,166
HOW THE RELIC YOU
ABANDONED IS USED.

233
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,541
( grunting )

234
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,666
( exclaims )

235
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,583
( screaming )

236
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,750
- IS THAT REALLY HOW RELICS
ARE MEANT TO BE CATALYZED?

237
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,083
- THE DOLWELLY SWORDSCALE
INCINERATES A TARGET

238
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,708
AT THE WIELDER'S PLEASURE,

239
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,500
ACCORDING TO THEIR
STRENGTH OF WILL...

240
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,000
YOU SEE... THE GROUND DOESN'T
POSSESS ANY WILL OF ITS OWN...

241
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,416
SO PLUNGED ABSENT-MINDEDLY
INTO THE EARTH,

242
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,791
THE BLADE HAS NO
POWER TO DRAW UPON...

243
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:28,250
IN MY CASE, THOUGH,
IT HAS PLENTY.

244
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,250
WHICH ALLOWS ME
TO SHOW YOU EXACTLY

245
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,541
WHAT A HERO RELIC CAN DO.

246
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:51,541
YOU'RE EITHER VERY CALM
RIGHT NOW, OR EXTREMELY DAZED.

247
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,875
- WHAT I SEEK IS
THUNDER, IZUCHI!

248
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,291
- OH, PLEASE!

249
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,958
- DON'T TELL ME THAT'S
ANOTHER RELIC THAT HE'S USING!

250
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,500
- SO SORRY...

251
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:08,000
IN ADDITION TO THE AILECRONO
SCYTHE KUU SO DEFTLY WIELDS,

252
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,041
AND OF COURSE THE
DOLUELI SWORDSCALE,

253
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,458
WE HAVE THE ELEMIO COMB.

254
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,833
AND AS YOU HAVE JUST
WITNESSED, MY FRIENDS...

255
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,916
THE COMB NULLIFIES
VIRTUALLY ANY MAGIC SPELL

256
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,541
THAT IT ENCOUNTERS.

257
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,750
- FOR A GRAND TOTAL OF THREE.
- WE MUST RETREAT...

258
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,666
THE ODDS IN THIS FIGHT
ARE NOT IN OUR FAVOR.

259
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,291
- MOVE IT, RYNER!
- ALRIGHT FINE! RUN!

260
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,250
- RUN IF YOU MUST.
YOU WON'T GET FAR.

261
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,583
RESONATE!

262
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,250
- ( exclaims )

263
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,166
- COME ON!

264
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,000
- ( gasps )

265
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,958
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
ARE YOU... HEY...

266
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,541
- Sui: WHY DELIGHT!

267
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:52,000
YOU WANT EVERYTHING TO
JUST CRUMBLE AND DISSAPEAR.

268
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,166
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HIM?

269
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,375
- DON'T BE CUTE.

270
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,458
I CAN'T VERY WELL STEAL
THE ALPHA STIGMA

271
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,916
WITHOUT FIRST ROUSING IT.

272
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
- ROUSING WHAT?

273
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,333
- YOU MEAN YOU REALLY
HAVE NO IDEA?

274
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:05,750
OF ALL TABOOS, THE ALPHA
STIGMA IS THE MOST HATED.

275
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,291
ONCE AWAKENED IT
KNOWS NO RESTRAINT.

276
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,916
IT ANNIHILATES.

277
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,083
INDISCRIMINATELY... HENCE ITS
BEARERS ARE MALIGNED AS DEMONS.

278
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,625
- ( gasping )

279
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,000
YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T MATTER.

280
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:24,375
( echoing ) NO. YOU'RE WRONG...
IT DOES...

281
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,958
- THEY'RE MONSTERS WHOSE VERY
EXISTENCE BREEDS DESTRUCTION!

282
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,000
- RYNER!

283
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,500
- ( Ryner exclaims )

284
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,333
IT'S ALL POINTLESS.

285
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,416
YOU'VE GOT TO GET
OUT OF HERE, FERRIS!

286
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,625
RUN AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN!

287
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:55,541
AH! DON'T LOOK BACK!
I CAN'T...

288
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,833
- WHAT IS THIS?

289
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,708
- ( Ryner exclaiming in pain )

290
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:07,666
PLEASE! GET OUT OF HERE!
I CAN'T CONTROL MYSELF!

291
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,916
I'M A MONSTER!
I'LL KILL...

292
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,041
( gasps )

293
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,250
I'LL KILL YOU...

294
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,666
SO WHAT?
PEOPLE DIE EVERYDAY.

295
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,833
WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL ONE
MORE POSSIBLY MAKE?

296
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,541
( screaming ) SHUT UP!

297
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:32,416
JUST ACCEPT IT.
THE WORLD IS YOUR PLAYGROUND.

298
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,166
LET LOOSE.
HAVE A FEW LAUGHS.

299
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,541
( screaming )

300
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,666
( laughing maniacally )

301
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,791
- AND, THE FINAL TETHER
HAS SNAPPED...

302
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,375
THE ALPHA STIGMA IS AWAKE.

303
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,833
- WHAT HAVE YOU
VERMIN DONE TO RYNER?

304
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,416
- I'VE FREED HIM TO RAIN
DOWN CATASTROPHE LIKE A GOD...

305
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,916
WE'LL KILL HIM BEFORE
THINGS GET TOO ROCKY, THOUGH.

306
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,750
RECKLESS, YES. BUT THE ONLY
WAY TO BORE OUT A STIGMA.

307
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,166
- ( Ryner laughing maniacally )

308
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,458
- HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED ANYTHING?

309
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,625
I TOLD YOU... THE COMB
NULLIFIES YOUR STRENGTH...

310
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:15,375
THERE'S NO POINT IN
TRYING TO RESIST US.

311
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:20,708
- Ryner: ANALYZE EXISTENCE.
AND RELEASE. BE GONE, WORM.

312
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,083
- ( exclaims )
WHAT IN THE HELL?

313
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:28,208
( screaming )

314
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,458
BURN IT!

315
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,666
- OH MY...

316
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,916
- WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
YOU'RE NOT DYING ARE YOU?

317
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,416
- NO, I'M FINE.

318
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,458
WHAT ON EARTH IS HE...

319
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,166
AN ORDINARY ALPHA STIGMA BEARER
DOESN'T HAVE THIS KIND OF POWER!

320
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,291
- Ryner: YOU REALLY THINK
YOUR KIND OF MAGIC

321
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,875
IS GOING TO GET
THE BETTER OF ME?

322
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,458
- THE ELEMIO COMB MIGHT
AS WELL BE A CONJURER'S PROP.

323
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:07,458
- RYNER...

324
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:10,833
- LITTLE WORMS,
CRAWLING IN DIRT.

325
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,666
( laughing )

326
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,625
WRITHE IN A FLASH AND BE GONE!
LET ALL RETURN TO NOTHING!

327
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,708
- WE HAVE TO GET
OUT OF HERE, KUU.

328
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,041
WHATEVER HE IS, WE'RE TRUMPED.

329
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:44,000
- STOP, RYNER!

330
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:48,333
- RUN WHERE YOU WILL,
THE VOID AWAITS!

331
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,708
FIRST COMES DESTRUCTION.

332
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:56,125
I CREATE NOTHING. FORGIVE
NOTHING. SAVE NOTHING.

333
00:18:56,208 --> 00:19:00,000
I JUST ERASE. COMPLETELY.

334
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,541
- DON'T YOU EVER GET LONELY

335
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,541
LIVING HERE ALL
BY YOURSELF, RYNER?

336
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,916
I KNOW I SURE WOULD.

337
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,916
- NOT REALLY, I MEAN
I'VE GOT ALL YOU GUYS.

338
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,583
- YOU KNOW, I COULD PRETEND TO
BE YOUR MOM FROM NOW ON,

339
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,125
IF YOU WANT...

340
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,833
JUST CALL FOR YOUR "MOTHER"
AND I'LL RUN RIGHT TO YOUR SIDE.

341
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,000
- HEY! I GET DIBS
ON BEING HIS DAD!

342
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,208
- EWW...

343
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,083
I'M NOT GONNA BE MARRIED
TO SOME ICKY BOY.

344
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,750
- I'VE BEEN DUMPED!

345
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,625
- ( all laughing )

346
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:35,125
- Man 1: RUN! HURRY!
- Man 2: GET OUT OF HERE! GO!

347
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,750
- FILTHY GHOULS, I WANT
EVERY SCRAP YOU'VE PILFERED

348
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,291
OFF THE BODIES OF
OUR FALLEN COMRADES!

349
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:52,375
- Talrom: WE MEAN NO DISRESPECT.
WE JUST DO THIS TO SURVIVE.

350
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,541
- ( screaming ) NO!

351
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,583
- NO PLEASE, SIR!
MY LITTLE GIRL'S INNOCENT...

352
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,791
( gasps )

353
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,666
- ( screaming ) MOM!

354
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,083
- GIVE QUILL BACK!

355
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:16,083
- WHAT I SEEK IS THE
BURNING FIELDS. KURENAI!

356
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,125
- ( screaming )

357
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,541
- THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU DEFY US.

358
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,166
- WRETCHED SCUM!

359
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,250
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU SAY!

360
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,000
- WHAT I SEEK IS THE
BURNING FIELD. KURENAI!

361
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,958
- ( screaming )

362
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,625
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
THAT KID! LOOK AT HIS EYES!

363
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,958
- IT'S ALRIGHT, QUILL...

364
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:03,375
- THAT'S THE ALPHA STIGMA!
RUN AWAY! JUST RUN AWAY!

365
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,458
- ( whimpering )

366
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,583
- QUILL?

367
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:21,416
- Quill: MONSTER...
- Man 1: AN ALPHA STIGMA.

368
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,541
- Man 2:
WHAT WAS TALROM THINKING?

369
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,500
WE CAN'T HAVE
A KID LIKE THIS HERE!

370
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,125
- Man 3: WE'VE BEEN TRICKED
INTO TAKING HIM IN...

371
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,375
- Man 4: A CREATURE
LIKE THAT'LL BRING US

372
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,791
NOTHING BUT TROUBLE...

373
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,458
- HE'S A MONSTER...
A REEKING, BLOODTHIRSTY BRUTE!

374
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,208
- YOU SHOULD BE PUT
DOWN LIKE A DOG!

375
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,041
- MONSTER?

376
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,333
THEY WE'RE RIGHT.

377
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,125
I AM A MONSTER.

378
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,666
I BRING ONLY DEATH.

379
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,375
- ( theme song playing )

380
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:42,208
- Ryner: THIS SUCKS.
THERE'S NO POINT TO ANY OF IT.

381
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:44,208
YOU PEOPLE FINALLY GET
WHY THE ONLY THING

382
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,625
I EVER WANT TO DO
IS SLEEP ALL DAY?

383
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:51,000
DAMN IT... WHY CAN'T THE
WORLD JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?
