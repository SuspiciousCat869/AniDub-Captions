1
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:27,250
- SION, DON'T GRIEVE
FOR YOUR MOTHER.

2
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:32,208
YOU'VE GROWN INTO SUCH AN
AMAZING YOUNG MAN ALREADY

3
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:35,125
AND I COULDN'T BE
PROUDER OF YOU, MY DARLING.

4
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:37,500
AND HOWEVER LOWBORN YOU ARE,

5
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:41,125
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMEONE
WILLING TO CARRY YOUR TORCH.

6
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:45,625
SO EVEN IF I'M NOT HERE,
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

7
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,000
- Iris: YOUR MAJESTY?

8
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,833
- SORRY, YOU WERE TELLING ME
ABOUT NELPHA.

9
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:58,458
- NOW WHERE EXACTLY
DID I LEAVE OFF?

10
01:00:58,541 --> 01:01:01,541
LET'S SEE, THERE'S A VALIANT
PRINCE AND A STUPID PRINCE.

11
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:04,666
THE STUPID PRINCE ISN'T POPULAR
WITH THE COMMONERS.

12
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:07,041
- HUH?
- YEAH!

13
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:10,916
- Iris: THE VALIANT PRINCE HAS
JUST ABOUT EVERYONE'S SUPPORT.

14
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,083
- AND THAT'S
TOALE NELPHI, RIGHT?

15
01:01:13,166 --> 01:01:16,041
- UH-HUH. HE'S EVEN TAMED
THE WILD BEAST!

16
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:19,875
SORT OF, I GUESS...
MOSTLY BY SHARING HIS DESSERT.

17
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:21,791
- ( laughing )

18
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:25,125
I SEE. SO, RYNER AND FERRIS
HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE

19
01:01:25,208 --> 01:01:26,416
IN TOALE'S MANOR HOUSE?

20
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,458
- YEP.

21
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:30,875
- INTERESTING.

22
01:01:30,958 --> 01:01:34,083
- ( theme song playing )

23
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:03,625
- Calne: SO FAR, MAJORITY
OPINION CONDEMNS

24
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:04,875
THE GOODWILL
MISSION TO NELPHA

25
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:06,583
AS A POTENTIAL
POLITICAL BLUNDER.

26
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:08,833
- WHICH ALSO REFLECTS JUST
HOW MANY PEOPLE THINK

27
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:10,333
THE VISIT IS IMMINENT.

28
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:12,750
- POINT BEING THE PUBLIC
IS TAKING AN INTEREST.

29
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:15,333
THIS IS DUKE STEARIED'S WAY OF
GOADING YOU INTO A TRAP.

30
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,916
- KNOWING WHAT WE DO,

31
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,083
THERE'S NO SENSE
IN TAKING THE RISK.

32
01:03:19,166 --> 01:03:21,416
- Miran: I RESPECTFULLY
BEG TO DIFFER.

33
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:26,208
- Calne: YOU DON'T THINK
HE SHOULD GO?

34
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:27,708
COLONEL FROAUDE, PLEASE...

35
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:30,750
- A CLEVER STRATEGIST WOULD
SEE THIS LESS AN OBSTACLE

36
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:32,000
THAN AN OPPORTUNITY.

37
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:34,125
IF THE THREAT IS HANDLED
WITH A CERTAIN FINESSE,

38
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:36,208
THE TRAP CAN NOT ONLY BE AVOIDED

39
01:03:36,291 --> 01:03:38,666
BUT SPRUNG INSTEAD ON THE VILE
TRAITORS WHO'VE DARED SET IT

40
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:39,375
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

41
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:40,750
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

42
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:42,750
THE BAIT FOR THAT LITTLE
TURNABOUT IS STILL HIS LIFE!

43
01:03:42,833 --> 01:03:45,333
HE CAN'T JUST STROLL INTO
IMPERIAL NELPHA LIKE THAT!

44
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:47,875
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
THE CONSPIRATORS WANT HIM TO DO!

45
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:51,333
- THEIR PLOT WILL ONLY SUCCEED
IF HIS GRACE IS VULNERABLE.

46
01:03:51,416 --> 01:03:54,291
- HE WOULD BE VULNERABLE,
SO FAR AWAY FROM HOME.

47
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:58,500
- NOT IF ON HIS JOURNEY
I AM ALLOWED TO ACCOMPANY HIM.

48
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:00,083
- Claugh:
WHAT GUARANTEE DO WE HAVE

49
01:04:00,166 --> 01:04:01,208
THAT YOU'RE NOT AN ASSASSIN?

50
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:03,416
- IF I WERE, NO DOUBT
ELIMINATING ME

51
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,791
RIGHT HERE AND NOW

52
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:06,208
WOULD HIT THE ENEMY
WHERE IT WOULD HURT THEM MOST.

53
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:08,625
I ASSUME YOU'VE SUFFICIENT
COMMAND OF YOUR FACULTIES

54
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:10,750
TO DO SO, ADMIRAL KLOM?

55
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:13,125
- OH, BELIEVE ME, IF I THOUGHT
FOR EVEN A MOMENT

56
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:16,166
THAT YOU WERE TRULY A DANGER
TO HIS MAJESTY'S LIFE,

57
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:18,458
I WOULD KILL YOU ON THE SPOT.

58
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:25,583
- MY LIEGE,
WE AWAIT YOUR CHOICE.

59
01:04:27,666 --> 01:04:30,500
- WITH LIEUTENANT FROUADE
I WILL PROCEED WITH

60
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:31,791
THE GOODWILL MISSION.

61
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:33,041
- Claugh: BUT...

62
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:43,333
- Royal Caller: HIS MAJESTY
THE HIGH KING OF ROLAND,

63
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:45,083
SION ASTAL.

64
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:55,500
- DOES ROLAND MEAN TO
INVADE US YET AGAIN?

65
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:57,375
- AS IT STANDS NOW,

66
01:04:57,458 --> 01:05:05,458
NELPHA WOULD CRUMBLE EASILY
IF THEY CHOSE TO ATTACK.

67
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:07,666
- YOUR MAJESTY,
IT IS A PLEASURE

68
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,250
TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

69
01:05:09,333 --> 01:05:11,166
I'VE BUT PALTRY WORDS TO HONOR

70
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,458
SO SWIFT AND
FRIENDLY A RECEPTION.

71
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:15,458
- UH, FORGIVE MY MANNERS,
YOUR HIGHNESS.

72
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:19,083
I AM GREAD NELPHI,
RULER OF THE NELPHAN EMPIRE.

73
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:22,375
INDEED, SIR, YOUR REPUTATION
AS A KING HAS TRAVELED

74
01:05:22,458 --> 01:05:23,416
FAR ABROAD.

75
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,666
YOUR NAME IS SYNONYMOUS
WITH WISDOM.

76
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:28,291
IT IS TO BASK IN THAT
WISDOM THAT I HAVE TRAVELED

77
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:29,541
SO FAR FROM HOME.

78
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,958
- Gread: QUITE THE
QUICKSILVER TONGUE, I SEE.

79
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:36,125
- ON THE CONTRARY, I'VE AGONIZED
OVER THAT SPEECH FOR SOME TIME.

80
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:39,875
SUCH IS MY HOPE THAT
OUR COUNTRYMEN MAY BE BROTHERS.

81
01:05:39,958 --> 01:05:43,375
- YOUR MAJESTY, I...
- ( laughter )

82
01:05:44,291 --> 01:05:46,625
- IF IT ISN'T SION ASTAL!

83
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:48,583
WHAT A YOUNG SAPLING YOU ARE!

84
01:05:48,666 --> 01:05:51,416
AND SPROUTING FROM SUCH
DESICCATED CLAY.

85
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,708
- STARNEL! HOW DARE YOU INSULT
OUR VISITOR!

86
01:05:53,791 --> 01:05:56,166
- YOU WILL ADDRESS ME AS PRINCE,
LITTLE MAN!

87
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:58,000
- CEASE YOUR PRATTLING!

88
01:05:59,958 --> 01:06:05,125
- EXCUSE MY LACK OF DECORUM.
I AM SION ASTAL, KING OF ROLAND.

89
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:06,958
- QUITE A MOUTHFUL
FOR THE STEWARD

90
01:06:07,041 --> 01:06:08,875
OF A BACKWATER KINGDOM.

91
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:11,000
DON'T YOU TOUCH ME!

92
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:14,500
- YOUR MERE PRESENCE
IS AN INSULT! REMOVE YOURSELF!

93
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:15,625
- HMMM.

94
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:23,125
- YOUR MAJESTY,
I HUMBLY APOLOGIZE.

95
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:25,250
I FEAR MY SON IS
INCAPABLE OF DECENT SPEECH.

96
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:26,875
- PLEASE, DON'T APOLOGIZE.

97
01:06:26,958 --> 01:06:29,708
FOR ALL YOUR SON'S ILL INTENT,
HE DOES SPEAK HONESTLY.

98
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:32,833
I AM A SAPLING.
AND ROLAND SCARCELY HAS

99
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:34,666
THE GRANDEUR OF ITS NEIGHBOR.

100
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:37,791
- WERE I TO REQUEST YOUR
ATTENDANCE AT A BANQUET HELD

101
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:39,333
IN YOUR HONOR
TOMORROW NIGHT, SIR,

102
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:41,625
WOULD YOU CONSIDER
STAYING TO DINE WITH ME?

103
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:44,166
- IT WOULD BE BESTIAL TO REFUSE.

104
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:49,375
- Fiole: HIS MAJESTY IS
BY FAR THE GREATEST PERSON

105
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:50,750
I'VE EVER KNOWN.

106
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:53,375
HE BELIEVES IN DEALING
WITH PEOPLE, EVEN COMMONERS,

107
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:54,666
AS EQUALS.

108
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:58,083
HE USES HIS POWER
TO PROTECT THE DOWNTRODDEN.

109
01:06:58,166 --> 01:07:00,416
- YOU HAVE A WEAKNESS FOR
UNDELIVERED LETTERS,

110
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:01,750
IT WOULD SEEM, SIR.

111
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:04,750
- YES, WELL, THIS ONE
WON'T REMAIN SO FOR LONG.

112
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:07,250
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
THE EAGER HEIR?

113
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:09,250
PRINCE STARNEL, I MEAN.

114
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:12,250
AT THE END OF WHOSE STRING
DOES THE MAN DANGLE?

115
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:14,875
- THAT WILL BECOME
CLEAR PRESENTLY.

116
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:17,375
MY NETWORK
OF INFORMANTS IS VAST.

117
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:19,458
- AS IS THE ONE PULLING
THEIR STRINGS,

118
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:20,916
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN?

119
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,208
- I AM AN EXCELLENT MAN TO
HAVE AT HEEL, YOUR MAJESTY,

120
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:25,500
AS I'M CERTAIN WILL BECOME
PERFECTLY EVIDENT

121
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:26,708
BEFORE TOO LONG.

122
01:07:26,791 --> 01:07:29,000
- AN ENCOURAGING THOUGHT TO
HAVE IN MIND.

123
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:31,291
SEE TO YOUR INFORMANTS, THEN.

124
01:07:31,375 --> 01:07:34,875
- I'LL BE BACK SOON.
- YOU WOULD GO FORTH ALONE?

125
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:37,416
- I AM NOT THE SORT OF MAN
WHOM DEATH IS LIKELY

126
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,958
TO CATCH BY SURPRISE.

127
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:43,333
- UNDERSTOOD, SIR. I WILL TEND
TO YOUR SAFETY IN ABSENTIA.

128
01:07:52,375 --> 01:07:54,416
- ( yawning )

129
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:57,958
( gasping )

130
01:07:58,041 --> 01:08:00,166
- Sion: HELLO, OLD FRIEND,
I'VE MISSED YOU TERRIBLY.

131
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,375
I TRUST THE SEARCH GOES WELL?

132
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:04,916
- OKAY, CLEARLY I HAVEN'T HAD
ENOUGH SLEEP YET.

133
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,083
- ( groaning in pain )

134
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,083
- HUNGRY ENOUGH TO GNAW
AT THE WRITING DESK, ARE WE?

135
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:12,375
- YEAH, REAL FUNNY HOW
MY MOLARS JUST WOUND UP

136
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:13,916
EMBEDDED IN THIS THING!

137
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,416
- I HARDLY TOUCHED YOU. BESIDES,
YOU WERE STANDING IN MY WAY.

138
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,875
- YOU COULD'VE ASKED ME TO MOVE!

139
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:20,416
- WELL, THE TWO OF YOU
SEEM TO BE GETTING ALONG, HUH?

140
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,708
- Ryner and Ferris:
YOU'VE GOT A WARPED IDEA

141
01:08:21,791 --> 01:08:23,208
OF "GETTING ALONG!"

142
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:25,000
- THIS VICIOUS HARPY'S BEEN
TREATING ME LIKE A WORN OUT

143
01:08:25,083 --> 01:08:25,875
WEAPONS RACK SINCE...

144
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:29,458
( groaning in pain )
STOP IT.

145
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:31,666
- DEVELOP SOME CALLUSES
AND WE'LL DISCUSS IT.

146
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:34,000
I'D SAY SHE'S TREATING YOU
FAR MORE DELICATELY

147
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:35,916
THAN SHE EVER DID ME.

148
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,208
- ( groaning in pain )

149
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:43,208
THERE HAPPENS TO BE WORD
FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

150
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:46,333
BUT, FOR FEAR OF MY LIFE,
I WON'T UTTER IT OUT LOUD.

151
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:48,500
- REFINED?

152
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:52,041
- UH, NO. NOT QUITE. THOUGH
"CRUEL" APPLIES TO TWO PEOPLE

153
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:53,958
IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW.

154
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:58,916
- THANKS FOR WAITING.
SO THEN, UH...

155
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,458
WHAT BRINGS RYNER'S COUSIN
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE?

156
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:03,666
- WAIT, WHO TOLD YOU
THIS GUYS' MY COUSIN?

157
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:04,875
HE ROLAND'S K...

158
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:05,958
- ( screaming in pain )

159
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,625
- DON'T TEASE THE MAN.

160
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:10,000
- HEY! WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

161
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:11,166
- Sion: PLAY ALONG.

162
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:14,583
- OH YEAH! COUSIN, EXACTLY!
BY MARRIAGE.

163
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:16,291
WHO I REALLY CAN'T STAND.

164
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:18,041
WAKE ME UP WHEN IT'S TIME
FOR LUNCH, WILL YA?

165
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:20,250
- HE DOES LIKE TO
SPEND HIS TIME NAPPING.

166
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:24,750
- HA! LIKE TO, YES, IF SOMEONE
WOULD GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY!

167
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:27,375
- WOULD THIS "SOMEONE"
BE THE INNOCENT YOUNG GIRLS

168
01:09:27,458 --> 01:09:28,958
YOU TRAIPSE ABOUT ON
THE PROWL FOR AT NIGHT?

169
01:09:29,041 --> 01:09:31,708
- YOU'RE STILL UP TO THAT?
- SHUT UP!

170
01:09:31,791 --> 01:09:33,375
- PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

171
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:34,958
BUT YOU'RE
QUITE AN AMUSING TRIO.

172
01:09:35,041 --> 01:09:37,166
- All: TRIO?

173
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,833
- NOT TO PRY OR ANYTHING,

174
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:40,958
BUT YOU BELONG TO THE
ROYAL BLOODLINE, DON'T YOU?

175
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:42,833
- YOU MAKE IT SOUND
MORE GLAMOROUS THAN

176
01:09:42,916 --> 01:09:44,125
IT ACTUALLY IS.

177
01:09:44,208 --> 01:09:45,833
- BUT YOU'RE THE ELDEST SON
OF PRINCE STARNEL.

178
01:09:45,916 --> 01:09:48,125
- ONE GENERATION AWAY
FROM THE THRONE.

179
01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:49,375
- YES.

180
01:09:49,458 --> 01:09:51,375
WHICH MORE THAN ANYTHING
JUST MAKES ME A BURDEN

181
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:52,708
TO MY FATHER.

182
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:55,083
- AND YET YOU HAVE A
CELEBRATED ACADEMIC RECORD.

183
01:09:55,166 --> 01:09:57,500
IT'S EVEN SAID THE
IMPERIAL CABINET MEMBERS

184
01:09:57,583 --> 01:09:59,833
SECRETLY CONSULT YOU
OVER YOUR FATHER'S HEAD

185
01:09:59,916 --> 01:10:01,375
ON MATTERS OF STATE.

186
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:05,291
- I WEIGH IN OCCASIONALLY ON
BEHALF OF MY SIBLINGS PERHAPS.

187
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:06,875
BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.

188
01:10:06,958 --> 01:10:07,875
- ( gulping )

189
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:11,541
- YOU KNOW, IT'S A SHAME
HE'S SO MODEST.

190
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:13,416
HE'S NICER THAN THE
HACK LOUNGING AROUND

191
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,750
IN ROLAND'S PALACE.

192
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:16,708
- HUH?
- ( groaning in pain )

193
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:22,208
- IS THERE AN ACTUAL POINT TO
YOU BEING HERE OR DID YOU

194
01:10:22,291 --> 01:10:23,375
JUST COME TO BADGER ME?

195
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:25,500
- IT IS RATHER FUN
WATCHING YOU OVERREACT.

196
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:27,125
- I NEED A BETTER REASON
THAN THAT!

197
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:30,375
- WELL, IF YOU INSIST.
- WONDERFUL.

198
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:33,041
- I AM IN NEED
OF YOUR ASSISTANCE, RYNER.

199
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:51,833
- ( gasping )

200
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:21,500
- Ryner: I'M EXHAUSTED.
AND FOR THE RECORD, THIS SUCKS.

201
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:24,250
REMIND ME WHY WE LET SION
TALK US INTO THIS FARCE?

202
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:27,416
- WELL, IT'S EITHER BE HIS
TEMPORARY BODY GUARDS

203
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,625
OR THE WYNNIT DANGO SHOP
WILL BE DECIMATED.

204
01:11:30,708 --> 01:11:34,000
- SO, UH, I TAKE THAT TO MEAN
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED FOR HIM.

205
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:36,333
- DOES HE LOOK LIKE
HE'S IN DANGER?

206
01:11:36,416 --> 01:11:37,875
- ( laughing )
- Ryner: NOT REALLY.

207
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:39,791
- Nelphan Guardsman:
THERE'S SOMEONE UP ON THE ROOF!

208
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:41,083
- UH-OH.

209
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:44,541
- ( chattering )

210
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,666
- ( footsteps )

211
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,666
- Miran: I AM OBLIGED
TO YOUR PATIENCE, HIGHNESS.

212
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:01,625
- YOUR REPORT.

213
01:12:01,708 --> 01:12:05,125
- MAY I PRESENT COUNT WEARIUS,
FORMERLY A LINCHPIN

214
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:06,541
IN THIS AFFAIR.

215
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:09,250
- Sion: AND TO WHOM
DOES HE LEAD BACK?

216
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:11,416
- WHY TO PRINCE STARNEL,
NATURALLY.

217
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:14,250
THE ROOT OF THIS SORDID BUSINESS
WOULD APPEAR TO STEM FROM RUMORS

218
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:16,125
THAT TOALE NELPHI WILL
SOON BE NAMED

219
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:17,625
AS EMPEROR GREAD'S
SUCCESSOR.

220
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:20,250
- SO THE PRINCE ARRANGED
FOR HIS OWN FATHER TO BE

221
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:21,791
SUMMARILY REMOVED

222
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:24,583
BEFORE HIS SON'S GOOD FORTUNE
COULD BAR THE WAY TO POWER.

223
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:28,666
- YES. AND TO THIS END, HE HAS
BRAZENLY SOLICITED THE AID OF

224
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:31,458
ROLAND'S ILLUSTRIOUS NOBILITY.

225
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:34,375
- CAN I TRUST YOU NOT TO HAVE
SET THIS IN MOTION YOURSELF

226
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:37,166
SO AS TO CLEAR THE WAY TOWARD
MY CONQUERING MENORIS?

227
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:39,750
- IF I HAVE GONE TOO FAR
OR PRESUMED TOO MUCH,

228
01:12:39,833 --> 01:12:43,583
A WORD FROM YOUR MAJESTY
WILL SUFFICE TO STAY ME.

229
01:12:43,666 --> 01:12:46,375
- I MUST APPRISE THE EMPEROR
OF THIS SITUATION.

230
01:12:46,458 --> 01:12:49,375
WE SHALL LET HIM DEAL WITH HIS
TRAITOROUS SON AS HE WILL.

231
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:51,333
- OF COURSE, MY LIEGE.

232
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:53,375
( scoffing )

233
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:04,708
- Miran: A NIGHT FOR
ETERNAL REST IF EVER

234
01:13:04,791 --> 01:13:07,333
THERE WAS ONE, GENTLEMEN.

235
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:09,541
NOW THAT ALL THE
NELPHAN CONSPIRATORS HAVE BEEN

236
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:11,500
SERVED THEIR JUST DESSERTS,

237
01:13:11,583 --> 01:13:13,500
BUT ONE TASK REMAINS.

238
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:26,125
- HEY, FERRIS.
- I SEE HIM.

239
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:39,083
- AH, AND HERE I THOUGHT
TO MOVE IN SILENCE.

240
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:42,041
YOU KEEP A VERY SHREWD WATCH,
IT WOULD SEEM, LORD NELPHI.

241
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:44,250
- HUH?
- MY INFORMATION MADE NO MENTION

242
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:47,208
OF YOUR HAVING EVEN
BASIC COMBAT SKILLS, HOWEVER.

243
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:48,833
I'M TAKEN A BIT OFF GUARD.

244
01:13:48,916 --> 01:13:51,208
- AND WHO ARE YOU
TO SPY ON HIS LORDSHIP?

245
01:13:51,291 --> 01:13:53,333
- EXCUSE MY TARDY DECORUM,

246
01:13:53,416 --> 01:13:56,291
MIRAN FROUADE IS THE
NAME I'M MOST KNOWN BY.

247
01:13:56,375 --> 01:13:58,083
- MIRAN FROUADE.

248
01:13:58,166 --> 01:14:00,333
- I AM HERE BECAUSE,
TO ALL ACCOUNTS,

249
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:01,875
THE GOOD PEOPLE OF NELPHA

250
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:04,375
HAVE YOU IN MIND TO BE
THEIR NEXT RULER.

251
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:06,416
FOR WHICH, MY CONDOLENCES.

252
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,458
A WELL-LOVED KING AT THE
TILLER OF A PROSPEROUS NATION

253
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:12,791
DOES TEND TO POSE
A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM

254
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:16,458
FOR ONE SUCH AS I.

255
01:14:16,541 --> 01:14:19,583
LET THERE BE DARKNESS!

256
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:27,208
- CAN YOU TELL WHAT MAGIC
IS HE USING?

257
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:32,166
- Ryner: IT'S NOT MAGIC.

258
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:34,583
THE ALPHA STIGMA CAN'T MAKE OUT
WHAT THE HELL IT IS.

259
01:14:34,666 --> 01:14:36,375
- DARKNESS SCOURGE!

260
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:37,666
- HEADS UP, FERRIS!

261
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:41,791
- GET ON WITH IT!
- DONE.

262
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:44,916
I OFFER UP A CONTRACT TO BEAR
THE WICKED SPIRIT BEAST

263
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,208
THAT SLEEPS
WITHIN THE EARTH!

264
01:14:47,291 --> 01:14:49,541
- HE'S BEEN TRAINED IN
ESTABULIAN MAGIC.

265
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:56,083
- I SEEK THE BURNING FIELD.
KURENAI!

266
01:14:56,166 --> 01:14:57,791
- ROLANDIAN AS WELL?

267
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:00,375
DARKNESS, PROTECT!

268
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:10,458
I SEE... YOU'RE NOT
LORD NELPHI AT ALL, ARE YOU?

269
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:13,666
BUT YOU ARE HIS
WISELY CHOSEN SENTINEL.

270
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:16,750
AND THE FAIR ONE'S
SWORDSMANSHIP IS EXCELLENT.

271
01:15:16,833 --> 01:15:19,291
I COMMEND YOU BOTH.

272
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:21,541
THAT HE WOULD TROUBLE TO
SURROUND HIMSELF WITH

273
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:22,875
THE LIKES OF BOTH OF YOU

274
01:15:22,958 --> 01:15:26,708
IS RATHER REVEALING.
MY TIMING IS IMPECCABLE.

275
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:32,875
- ( groaning )
- Ryner: FERRIS!

276
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:48,916
- WHAT I SEEK IS THUNDER.
IZUCHI!

277
01:15:57,166 --> 01:15:59,750
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- ( gasping )

278
01:16:04,166 --> 01:16:06,000
- YOU SON OF A...

279
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:08,625
- SHE'S QUITE BEYOND HOPE,
I FEAR.

280
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:10,750
THE WEAK CAN ONLY
PROSTRATE THEMSELVES

281
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:11,833
BEFORE THE STRONG.

282
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:13,666
- YOU'RE CALLING FERRIS WEAK?

283
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:16,041
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, PAL.

284
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:17,666
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT,

285
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,833
SHE'S NOT THE SORT OF PERSON
TO PROSTRATE HERSELF

286
01:16:19,916 --> 01:16:24,666
BEFORE ANYONE, LET ALONE SOME
CHEAP, SKULKING COWARD LIKE YOU.

287
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:26,041
IF SHE'S WEAK,

288
01:16:26,125 --> 01:16:28,250
THEN I'M DOUBLY SO FOR
HAVING HER BOOT TO MY NECK!

289
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:32,916
- THEN YOU'LL BE LESS OF
A CHALLENGE THAN SHE WAS.

290
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,750
- I WOULDN'T BE
SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

291
01:16:34,833 --> 01:16:37,000
- DO YOU SUPPOSE
YOU CAN VANQUISH ME?

292
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:40,208
- YEAH, WELL,
WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

293
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:43,458
THAT RING'S HOW YOU CONTROL
SHADOWS, ISN'T IT?

294
01:16:43,541 --> 01:16:44,833
- THERE'S A GREAT DEAL
MORE TO YOU

295
01:16:44,916 --> 01:16:46,250
THAN MEETS
THE EYE, BOY.

296
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:48,208
HOW DO YOU COME BY
SUCH KNOWLEDGE?

297
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:51,750
- I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE LEGENDS
OF GREAT EMPEROR KOKUEI,

298
01:16:51,833 --> 01:16:55,916
THE SHADOW KING WHO ONCE
ENSHROUDED THE WORLD.

299
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,500
IT'S WRITTEN THAT HE BESTOWED
UPON HIS CHIEF SUBORDINATE

300
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:00,666
A VERY POWERFUL RING.

301
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:04,416
WITH IT, ONE HELD
SWAY OVER SHADOW.

302
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,500
THE RING'S BEARER USED IT TO
ASSASSINATE THE LEADERS

303
01:17:07,583 --> 01:17:09,708
OF RIVAL NATIONS.

304
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:13,541
BUT A LEGENDARY HERO SEVERED
THE FINGER ON WHICH

305
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:15,250
THE RING WAS BORNE.

306
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:17,875
AND IF THE OLD STORIES
ARE TO BE TRUSTED,

307
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:22,291
THAT LEGENDARY HERO'S NAME
WAS HALFORD MIRAN.

308
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:26,208
"HE SWUNG ALOFT HIS MIGHTY SWORD
AND BLOODILY CUT OFF THE RING,

309
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:28,166
"REPELLING ITS POWER
IN ONE BLOW."

310
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:29,833
- Miran: CAN YOU DO THE SAME?

311
01:17:29,916 --> 01:17:34,500
- MAYBE. AND, THEN AGAIN,
MAYBE I CAN'T. BUT FERRIS COULD.

312
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:36,833
- DO YOU THINK ALL THAT TIME
MIGHT'VE BEEN BETTER SPENT

313
01:17:36,916 --> 01:17:39,041
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
THIS MAN'S WEAK SPOT?

314
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:40,666
- YOU THINK I'VE BEEN
TUTORING THE CREEP

315
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:42,583
ON HIS OWN MAGICAL RELIC
FOR THE PAST FIVE MINUTES?

316
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:44,500
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DISTRACT HIM

317
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:46,166
SO YOU COULD RUSH IN
UNEXPECTEDLY AND CHOP

318
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:47,541
THE STUPID THING OFF HIS FINGER!

319
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:49,291
- OH, UH, YES, OF COURSE.

320
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:51,083
SO I TAKE IT THE
RING HE'S WEARING

321
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:52,291
IS ONE OF OUR HERO RELICS?

322
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:53,916
- YES.

323
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,500
- THEN WHY ARE YOU
SLUMPED ON YOUR BACKSIDE

324
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,875
LIKE A WET RAG DOLL

325
01:17:56,958 --> 01:17:59,500
WHEN THERE'S CLEARLY
SERIOUS WORK TO BE DONE HERE?

326
01:17:59,583 --> 01:18:01,666
- HEY! YOU'RE THE ONE...

327
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:04,291
- SO SORRY, IT SEEMS
MY HAND SLIPPED AGAIN.

328
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:05,541
- YEAH, SURE...

329
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:07,625
YOU KNOW WHAT? I REALLY
DON'T EVEN CARE ANYMORE,

330
01:18:07,708 --> 01:18:10,166
LET'S JUST CRUSH THIS GUY
TO A PULP ALREADY.

331
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:15,250
- ( laughing )

332
01:18:15,333 --> 01:18:17,958
I DARE SAY YOU'RE
REALLY AN AMUSING PAIR.

333
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:20,291
SUCH A SHAME I HAVE TO KILL YOU.

334
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:23,875
ALAS, I CAN'T LET POTENTIAL
NUISANCES TO MY MASTER

335
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:25,708
SIMPLY ROAM FREE.

336
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:27,666
- YOUR MASTER?

337
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:28,875
- I SHALL LET LORD TOALE LIVE.

338
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:31,458
FOR THE MOMENT
HE IS FAR LESS OF A CONCERN.

339
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:34,166
EVIDENTLY I HAVE MUCH
LARGER ISSUES TO GRAPPLE WITH

340
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:35,625
IN DISPOSING OF YOU TWO.

341
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:38,416
BUT UNTIL THE MATTER CAN BE
DEALT WITH APPROPRIATELY,

342
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,416
I BID YOU BOTH A FOND FAREWELL.

343
01:18:42,916 --> 01:18:44,791
- ( sighing )

344
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:46,583
IF HE HADN'T FALLEN
FOR OUR BLUFF

345
01:18:46,666 --> 01:18:48,625
THINGS COULD'VE
GOTTEN SERIOUSLY UGLY.

346
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:57,000
LOOK AT YOU. I'LL STAY UP
AND KEEP WATCH SO YOU CAN SLEEP.

347
01:18:57,083 --> 01:18:59,958
- IF YOU HAVE EVEN THE VAGUEST
IDEA OF TAKING ADVANTAGE

348
01:19:00,041 --> 01:19:00,916
OF THIS SITUATION...

349
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,750
- WILL YOU STOP WITH THAT?

350
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:18,708
- THE MAN'S PAST IS LIKE
A STRONGBOX RUSTED SHUT.

351
01:19:18,791 --> 01:19:20,458
I HAVEN'T FOUND A
SHRED OF INFORMATION

352
01:19:20,541 --> 01:19:23,375
THAT GOES BACK FURTHER THAN
DUKE FROUADE ADOPTING HIM.

353
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:26,958
ALL THE OBVIOUS PEOPLE TO ASK
ARE DEAD.

354
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:28,791
AND NOW YOU TELL ME
HE'S MASSACRED

355
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:30,333
THE NELPHAN
CO-CONSPIRATORS

356
01:19:30,416 --> 01:19:31,708
AGAINST YOUR LIFE.

357
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:33,625
- QUITE SO.

358
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:36,250
- HE'S DANGEROUS. GET RID
OF HIM WHILE YOU STILL CAN.

359
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:39,583
- ( knocking on door )

360
01:19:39,666 --> 01:19:41,125
- MIRAN FROUADE, SIR.

361
01:19:41,208 --> 01:19:44,375
I BRING ANOTHER REPORT OF THE
GOODWILL MISSION TO NELPHA.

362
01:19:44,458 --> 01:19:45,791
- BRING IT FORTH.

363
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:59,791
- FORAGING THROUGH THE ARCHIVES
FOR USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT ME?

364
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:01,625
- WE HAVEN'T UNCOVERED MUCH.

365
01:20:05,666 --> 01:20:07,208
- ( laughing )

366
01:20:07,291 --> 01:20:09,375
AND YET YOUR RESEARCH
IS SO THOROUGH.

367
01:20:09,458 --> 01:20:11,833
DOES THE MYSTERY
DISTURB YOU, SIR?

368
01:20:11,916 --> 01:20:14,000
WILL YOU DISMISS ME?

369
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:17,458
- AFTER YOUR ASTUTE HANDLING OF
OUR ENEMIES IN NELPHA,

370
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:19,916
IT WOULD BE FOOLISH OF ME
TO DO SO.

371
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,458
- YOU ARE A VERY STRANGE
BREED OF MAN.

372
01:20:22,541 --> 01:20:24,625
- SO SAYS THE WALKING ENIGMA.

373
01:20:24,708 --> 01:20:26,666
- TO BE COMPLETELY FORTHCOMING,

374
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:29,416
IN YOUR POSITION I WOULD NOT
HESITATE TO DISPOSE OF ME.

375
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,000
- A KING IS ONLY AS EFFECTIVE

376
01:20:31,083 --> 01:20:32,750
AS THE PEOPLE HE SURROUNDS
HIMSELF WITH.

377
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:35,666
- OR INDEED THE CREDO
HE SUBSCRIBES TO.

378
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:38,375
MY LIEGE, I AM PROUD TO CALL
MYSELF YOUR MINION

379
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:40,083
AS LONG AS
IT MAY PLEASE YOU.

380
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:42,625
- Sion: YOU SPOKE OF
ANOTHER REPORT, I BELIEVE?

381
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:44,500
- WHILE TRAVELING
THROUGH NELPHA,

382
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:46,000
MY RECONNAISSANCE
HAPPENED TO BRING ME

383
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:47,500
TO A PRIVATE
RESIDENCE THERE.

384
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:49,333
TOALE NELPHI'S HOME.

385
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,375
- Sion: RYNER AND FERRIS
RISKED THEIR LIVES.

386
01:20:57,458 --> 01:20:59,375
FROUADE ACTED ON MY ORDERS,

387
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:02,708
YES, BUT I DIDN'T INTENTIONALLY
PUT THEM IN HARM'S WAY.

388
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:07,458
I CANNOT BE HELD
MORALLY RESPONSIBLE

389
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:10,750
FOR WHERE A MISUNDERSTANDING
MAY LEAD MY SUBORDINATE.

390
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:16,625
- LET'S GO BEFORE HE NOTICES.

391
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:18,625
- WHY?
- COME ON.

392
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:22,666
- Ryner: IF WE STAY,
WHEN FROUADE COMES BACK FOR US

393
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:25,083
HE'LL PROBABLY KILL TOALE
IN THE BARGAIN, HUH?

394
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:26,833
- Ferris: RYNER.
- YEAH?

395
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:29,166
- I THINK MY BACK INJURY
IS ALL BUT FORGOTTEN

396
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:30,583
NOW THAT I'M ON MY FEET.

397
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:33,875
YOU'VE A RATHER IMPRESSIVE KNACK
FOR THE HEALING ARTS.

398
01:21:33,958 --> 01:21:35,708
CRUDE THOUGH THEY ARE.

399
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:38,291
- IS THAT A "THANK YOU"?

400
01:21:43,583 --> 01:21:46,500
WELL, UH... I'M HAPPY
YOU'RE ON THE MEND.

401
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:51,166
( yawning ) COME ON,
WE'RE BURNING DAYLIGHT.

402
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:55,041
- Milk: YOU'RE CERTAIN
HE WAS GORGEOUS?

403
01:21:55,125 --> 01:21:56,791
AND THAT HIS
FLAXEN-HAIRED COMPANION

404
01:21:56,875 --> 01:21:58,333
CONSTANTLY BEAT HIM?

405
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:00,958
YOU'VE BEEN A HUGE HELP!

406
01:22:06,083 --> 01:22:09,541
HOLD TIGHT, RYNER MY LOVE!
I'M COMING FOR YOU!

407
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,458
- ( theme song playing )

408
01:23:41,208 --> 01:23:42,875
- Ryner: AS IF LOOKING
FOR HERO RELICS

409
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:44,166
WASN'T A BIG ENOUGH PAIN,

410
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,875
THE CRAZIES ARE
ON OUR TRAIL AGAIN.

411
01:23:45,958 --> 01:23:47,333
WHAT'S WITH "TABOO-BREAKING"?

412
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:48,833
AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

413
01:23:48,916 --> 01:23:51,333
HOW ABOUT I JUST DROP
THE WHOLE THING AND GO HOME?

414
01:23:51,416 --> 01:23:53,125
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE
AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN.

415
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:54,750
THIS TOTALLY SUCKS!
