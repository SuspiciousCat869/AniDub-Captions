1
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:27,041
- Ferris: IS THAT IT?

2
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,541
IT DOES MAKE SENSE.

3
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:32,625
IT'S ISOLATED WHICH WOULD
ALLOW FOR A VARIETY

4
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:34,958
OF NEFARIOUS ACTIVITIES.

5
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:36,500
- YES, I SUPPOSE.

6
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:41,125
- ( groans )

7
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:42,291
- KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN, PLEASE.

8
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:44,666
LEST AN ARROW REMOVES IT
FROM YOUR BODY.

9
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:48,541
- YEAH, GOOD CALL. THIS IS BAD.

10
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:51,875
MAGIC KNIGHTS OF RUNA.

11
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:57,375
( gasps )

12
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,625
- ( theme song playing )

13
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:43,750
- THE KING HAS ISSUED AN EDICT
PROCLAIMING THAT HE SHALL PAY

14
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:46,541
TRIBUTE TO THE NOBILITY
BY GRANTING THEM PROMOTIONS.

15
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:48,000
BUT, FRIENDS, THAT'S NOT ALL.

16
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:49,583
LET ME ASSURE YOU,

17
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:52,083
THE BENEVOLENCE OF HIS MAJESTY
DOES NOT END WITH THE NOBLES.

18
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:54,125
LORD ASTAL INTENDS
TO UTILIZE THE SKILLS

19
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:55,500
OF EVERY ABLE-BODIED CITIZEN

20
01:02:55,583 --> 01:02:57,125
BY GRANTING US POSTS.

21
01:02:57,208 --> 01:02:59,041
- ( cheering )

22
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:03,666
- JUST WHEN I THOUGHT WE
STOOD ON THE VERGE

23
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,125
OF BRINGING HIM TO HEEL,

24
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:07,458
THE MAN PULLS AN
EGREGIOUS STUNT LIKE THIS!

25
01:03:07,541 --> 01:03:09,291
- HE, A STAIN ON OUR
NATION'S HONOR,

26
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:11,375
MOCKS US WITH HIS INSOLENCE!

27
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:14,083
- THE KING'S REALLY
PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS.

28
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:17,166
- I KNOW, FROM
REAR ADMIRAL TO FIELD MARSHAL,

29
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:19,208
LOOKS LIKE CLAUGH'S MOVING UP
IN THIS WORLD, ISN'T HE?

30
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:24,541
- WHAT IS THE MEANING Of
MAKING ME FIELD MARSHAL?

31
01:03:24,625 --> 01:03:26,541
- ARE YOU UNSATISFIED
WITH THIS?

32
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:29,000
YOU'RE AWARE THE ONLY POSITION
HIGHER IS HIGH MARSHAL?

33
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:30,958
- DON'T MAKE THIS ABOUT
SOMETHING IT'S NOT.

34
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:33,125
THE PROMOTIONS THEMSELVES
AREN'T THE ISSUE.

35
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:36,041
IT'S THE POLITICAL
RAMIFICATIONS BEHIND THE EDICT.

36
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:38,500
- FORGIVE US IF WE SEEM
UNGRATEFUL, YOUR GRACE.

37
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:40,500
HOWEVER, BEING YOUR LOYAL
AND TRUE SUBJECTS,

38
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:41,750
WE FEEL IT OUR SWORN DUTY

39
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:43,916
TO WARN YOU THAT
THIS ACTION IS ILL-ADVISED.

40
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,416
- IF MISPERCEIVED AS
PROVOCATION BY YOUR ENEMIES,

41
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,125
YOU RUN THE RISK OF
STOKING FURTHER IRE

42
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:49,958
IN THOSE WHO
WOULD SUPPLANT YOU.

43
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:53,041
YOU WILL PLAY
RIGHT INTO THEIR HATRED, SIRE.

44
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:54,541
- WELL, I'M AT A LOSS.

45
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:57,041
I OFFER YOU A PROMOTION,
AND YOU COMPLAIN.

46
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:59,041
IS YOUR AMBITION SO SMALL?

47
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:01,291
- I RESENT THAT
IMPLICATION, MY LORD.

48
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:03,666
WE TRADE NOT OUR LOYALTY
FOR THE PROMISE OF RANK

49
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:06,166
BUT RATHER STAND BY YOUR SIDE
BECAUSE YOU INSPIRE US.

50
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,541
WE STAND BY YOU
BECAUSE WE WISH TO AID YOU

51
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:11,875
IN BRINGING TO FRUITION
YOUR VISION FOR ROLAND'S FUTURE.

52
01:04:11,958 --> 01:04:13,666
- BUT OF COURSE, LORD GNUBUL.

53
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,250
AND WHAT IF I WERE TO
TELL YOU THIS EDICT

54
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:18,125
PLAYS AN INTEGRAL ROLE
IN MY VISION FOR THE FUTURE?

55
01:04:18,208 --> 01:04:19,958
- WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO ACCEPT IT THEN?

56
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:21,083
- WELL, I...

57
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:24,041
- I'M ASSUMING YOU ALL
HAVE HEARD

58
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:25,916
OF THE NATION OF
GASTARK, HAVE YOU NOT?

59
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,958
- YES, I'VE A VAGUE IDEA OF IT.

60
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:29,583
IT'S A SMALL COUNTRY
ON THE NORTHERN END

61
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:30,833
OF THE CONTINENT, ISN'T IT?

62
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:32,250
- Sion: CORRECT.

63
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:34,791
I TRUST, THEN, THAT YOU KNOW
OF THE NATION OF STOHL?

64
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:36,708
- OF COURSE, YOUR MAJESTY.

65
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:38,125
IT'S THE MIGHTIEST AND
MOST PROMINENT KINGDOM

66
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:41,875
ON THE MENORIS CONTINENT.

67
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:43,416
- Sion: WITH AN EVER-GROWING
POPULATION,

68
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,958
STOHL'S MILITARY MIGHT IS
ROUGHLY FIVE TIMES OUR OWN.

69
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:49,541
YET, ACCORDING TO A RECENT
INTELLIGENCE DISPATCH,

70
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:52,125
OVER TWO THIRDS OF THEIR
TERRITORY IS CURRENTLY

71
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:54,333
BEING OCCUPIED BY GASTARK.

72
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:56,958
- WHAT?
- Noa: UNBELIEVABLE!

73
01:04:57,041 --> 01:05:00,125
HOW COULD THE MIGHTY FORCES
OF STOHL FALL SO EASILY?

74
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:01,833
- STOHL IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.

75
01:05:01,916 --> 01:05:05,333
OTHERS HAVE FALLEN AND BECOME
SUBJECT TO THEM AS WELL.

76
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:08,000
THE TRUE EXTENT OF
THE INVASION IS UNKNOWN.

77
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:09,791
IT'S RATHER FAR AWAY, AFTER ALL.

78
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:11,500
- Gnubul: INDEED IT IS.

79
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:15,000
FROM A GEOGRAPHIC STANDPOINT,
GASTARK POSES NO THREAT TO US.

80
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:17,833
A FULL-SCALE INVASION OF ROLAND
WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE.

81
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:20,541
- YES. GASTARK
MAY NOT COME TO US.

82
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,458
BUT THE FALLOUT WILL.

83
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:26,083
FEELING PRESSURE FROM GASTARK,
NATIONS WILL BE COMPELLED

84
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:27,625
TO INCREASE THEIR MILITARY MIGHT

85
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:31,083
AND THE FIGHTING COULD VERY WELL
END UP ON OUR DOORSTEP.

86
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:32,708
WE'RE NOT IMMUNE.

87
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
TIME'S OF THE ESSENCE, FRIENDS.

88
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:42,250
THE DAYS OF CIVIL STRIFE
AND INFIGHTING

89
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:43,583
CAN NO LONGER PREVAIL.

90
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:48,208
THAT SAID, FROAUDE HAS
TENDERED A PLAN OF ACTION.

91
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:51,125
HE PROPOSES TO SET A TRAP
FOR THE NOBLES WHO OPPOSE ME,

92
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:53,791
AND PURGE THEM ALL
IN ONE FELL SWOOP.

93
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:57,791
- PURGE THEM ALL, HUH? WOMEN,
CHILDREN, AND NOBLES, TOO?

94
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:01,791
MY KING, I BEG OF YOU,

95
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,541
IN ALL HUMILITY,
DO NOT CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL!

96
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:05,791
- I'M SORRY, CLAUGH.

97
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:09,458
I BELIEVE THIS IS THE PATH
ROLAND MUST TAKE.

98
01:06:09,541 --> 01:06:13,000
THIS IS A TIME FOR UNITY,
NOT FOR DIVISION.

99
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:14,958
WITH THAT SAID,

100
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:16,625
I AM THE SOVEREIGN KING
OF EVERY CREATURE

101
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:18,833
THAT DWELLS
WITHIN OUR BORDERS.

102
01:06:18,916 --> 01:06:21,416
EVEN MY ENEMIES, WHO WOULD
SUPPLANT ME AND SEE ME DEAD,

103
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:22,708
ARE ROLAND'S CHILDREN.

104
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:25,291
THEY ARE THE CITIZENS
OF THIS GREAT NATION.

105
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:29,583
AS SUCH, THEY TOO
DESERVE MY PROTECTION.

106
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:32,416
I WISH TO SAVE THEIR LIVES,
EVEN IF JUST A FEW OF THEM.

107
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,416
THIS IS MY DREAM!

108
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,041
TO UNIFY THIS LAND,
WITHOUT BLOODSHED!

109
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:41,750
SO YOU SEE, THIS IS WHY
I'M CARRYING OUT

110
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:44,333
SUCH AN EXTREME MEASURE.

111
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:46,750
ANY NOBLE WISHING TO
PLEDGE HIS LOYALTY TO ME

112
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:49,541
SHALL BE A FRIEND TO THE CROWN
AND THE CROWN TO HIM.

113
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:52,166
TOGETHER WE SHALL WORK
TO FORGE THE BONDS OF UNITY

114
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:55,208
THAT WILL USHER ROLAND
INTO THE FUTURE.

115
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:57,666
BUT SHOULD THEY CHOOSE
THE PATH OF OPPOSITION...

116
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,166
THEY CHOOSE THE WAY TO DEATH.

117
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:05,125
REMEMBER, FRIENDS,
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.

118
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:07,208
THIS COUNTRY CANNOT
FALL TO RUIN.

119
01:07:07,291 --> 01:07:09,416
I WON'T ALLOW IT.

120
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,750
WHO AMONG YOU WILL PLEDGE
TO STAND BY MY SIDE?

121
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:19,666
- FOR THE GLORY OF ROLAND,

122
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,833
I AM AT YOUR SERVICE,
YOUR MAJESTY.

123
01:07:26,791 --> 01:07:27,875
- All: FOR THE GLORY
OF ROLAND,

124
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:30,083
I AM AT YOUR SERVICE,
YOUR MAJESTY.

125
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:41,666
- QUELL THE NOBLES
WITH HONEYED WORDS.

126
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:45,250
WHEN THEIR GUARD'S DOWN,
PURGE THEM IN ONE FELL SWOOP.

127
01:07:45,333 --> 01:07:46,708
I EXPECTED THAT
YOU WOULD ULTIMATELY

128
01:07:46,791 --> 01:07:48,166
ACCEPT MY PROPOSITION,

129
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,875
BUT YOUR BENEVOLENCE
WAS QUITE SURPRISING.

130
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:54,250
YOU WISH TO SAVE THEIR LIVES,
EVEN IF ONLY A HANDFUL?

131
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:55,833
ISN'T THAT NICE?

132
01:07:55,916 --> 01:07:57,958
YOUR HEART'S PURE,
BUT YOUR MIND, NAIVE.

133
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:02,333
SURELY YOU KNOW
HOW THIS WILL END.

134
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:03,750
OR, PERHAPS YOU'VE
CONVINCED YOURSELF

135
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:05,333
THAT YOUR ENEMIES
WILL EMBRACE YOU

136
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:08,000
AND REJOICE
IN YOUR VISION OF UNITY.

137
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:09,291
BUT, YOUR MAJESTY,

138
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:12,083
THE PATH IS FRAUGHT
WITH PERILS BEYOND NUMBER.

139
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:14,833
IT WILL LEAD TO FAR MORE
BLOODSHED THAN MY WAY.

140
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:17,833
BUT, YOU'RE NOT
A STUPID MAN, ARE YOU?

141
01:08:17,916 --> 01:08:21,041
YOU WORRY BECAUSE
YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING.

142
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:22,750
AND BECAUSE YOU ARE
PLAGUED WITH WORRY,

143
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:24,333
I MUST WORK TO
LIGHTEN YOUR BURDEN,

144
01:08:24,416 --> 01:08:26,041
EVEN IF ONLY A LITTLE BIT.

145
01:08:29,416 --> 01:08:31,250
SO, FOR THE GLORY OF ROLAND
AND YOUR MAJESTY,

146
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:33,125
I AM AT YOUR SERVICE.

147
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:46,375
- LOOKS LIKE
MAJOR MILLER WOKE UP

148
01:08:46,458 --> 01:08:49,791
ON THE WRONG SIDE
OF THE BED AGAIN.

149
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,208
- HMM...

150
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:53,875
I GUESS HE'S UPSET
BECAUSE WE FAILED OUR MISSION.

151
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:55,791
- DON'T BEAT YOURSELF
UP, CAPTAIN.

152
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:57,041
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

153
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:59,416
WE CAN HARDLY BE BLAMED
FOR HOW IT TURNED OUT.

154
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,916
OUR OPPONENT WAS
FAR TOO POWERFUL FOR US.

155
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,333
I STILL FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE,

156
01:09:03,416 --> 01:09:05,833
BUT HIS MAGIC WAS MORE
POWERFUL THAN YOURS, CAPTAIN.

157
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:08,125
- Moe: YEAH, HIS STRENGTH
WAS BEYOND COMPARE.

158
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:09,791
HE EVEN CALLED FORTH
A RED DRAGON.

159
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:11,875
- ( roars )

160
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:14,250
- YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT WAS
TERRIFYING, WASN'T IT?

161
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:16,541
I WONDER WHAT'S
GOING ON OUT THERE.

162
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:19,833
- IT'S PROBABLY SOME SORT OF
TOURIST ATTRACTION BY NOW.

163
01:09:19,916 --> 01:09:21,333
- Moe: I BET THEY'RE MAKING
A FORTUNE

164
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:23,333
PEDDLING DRAGON SOUVENIRS.

165
01:09:23,416 --> 01:09:25,708
- OH PLEASE, WHAT IDIOT WOULD
BUY SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

166
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:27,666
- ( clears throat )

167
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:29,041
- LUKE, WHAT IF WE GET
PULLED OFF OF THE MISSION,

168
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:30,375
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

169
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:31,875
HOW WILL WE GO ON?

170
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:33,875
- LET'S NOT WORRY
ABOUT THAT YET.

171
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:35,041
I'M JUST CONCERNED
ABOUT THE FACT

172
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:36,666
THAT WHEN WE'RE
FACING YOUR TABOO-BREAKER,

173
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,833
EVERY ONE OF US SEEMS
TO BE OUT OF OUR ELEMENT.

174
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:40,041
- NO WE'RE NOT!

175
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:42,791
YOU MARK MY WORDS,
I WILL SAVE RYNER!

176
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:44,750
I WILL SAVE HIM
IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO!

177
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:45,875
- ( Luke shushing )

178
01:09:45,958 --> 01:09:47,166
- ( all laugh nervously )

179
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:49,833
- I SEE YOU'RE AS
SPIRITED AS EVER, CAPTAIN.

180
01:09:49,916 --> 01:09:51,500
A POSITIVE QUALITY.

181
01:09:51,583 --> 01:09:52,750
- OH, YES SIR.

182
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:54,916
A POSITIVE SPIRIT
BEGETS A POSITIVE OUTCOME!

183
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,750
- APPARENTLY, NOT ALWAYS.

184
01:09:56,833 --> 01:09:57,916
ACCORDING TO YOUR REPORT,

185
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,916
THIS TABOO-BREAKER
WAS QUITE THE HANDFUL.

186
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,208
- SIR, THIS MISSION
SHOULD BE A CINCH!

187
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:04,875
- BUT CAPTAIN, WE CAN'T.
WE'RE NO MATCH FOR HIS SKILLS.

188
01:10:04,958 --> 01:10:06,958
WE SHOULD WITHDRAW OURSELVES
FROM THIS MISSION.

189
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:08,416
- I AM NOT WITHDRAWING
MYSELF FROM ANYTHING,

190
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,041
AND NEITHER ARE ANY OF YOU.

191
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:12,041
I JUST WASN'T
SERIOUS ENOUGH LAST TIME.

192
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,083
ONCE I GET SERIOUS
I CAN TAKE CARE OF IT!

193
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:15,541
AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT!

194
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:16,791
- OF COURSE, CAPTAIN MILK,

195
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:19,875
WHATEVER YOU SAY, BUT...
I, I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

196
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:21,125
- Miller: WELL, WITH
A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE

197
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:23,791
THAT STRONG FROM LUKE,
I'M SURE YOU'LL DO FINE.

198
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:26,875
- UH, SIR, I DON'T THINK
YOU UNDERSTAND.

199
01:10:26,958 --> 01:10:28,250
- IT'S SETTLED.

200
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:30,583
CAPTAIN, I WILL CONTINUE
TO ENTRUST YOUR SQUADRON

201
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:32,875
WITH THE MISSION TO PURSUE
THESE TABOO-BREAKERS.

202
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:36,375
- SIR, I WILL GIVE YOU
EVERYTHING I'VE GOT!

203
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:39,375
SEE? I TOLD YOU
WE WOULDN'T GET THE BOOT!

204
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:40,541
- IN YOUR OPINION,

205
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:42,750
THIS TABOO-BREAKER
IS A PROBLEM THEN. YES?

206
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:45,291
- YES SIR. RYNER LUTE IS
DEFINITELY GOING TO BE AN ISSUE.

207
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:47,541
MORE SO THAN I EVER
IMAGINED, IN FACT.

208
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:48,958
BUT MORE THAN THAT,

209
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:51,750
IT LOOKS LIKE SION IS FINALLY
GOING TO MAKE A MOVE.

210
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:53,875
- YES, IT DOES APPEAR
THAT IS THE CASE.

211
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,625
- I SUPPOSE OUR COUNTRY
CAN'T MOVE ON

212
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:57,875
UNTIL THE CORRUPT NOBILITY
IS DRIVEN FROM IT.

213
01:10:57,958 --> 01:11:00,500
THEY MUST BE PURGED
OR WE ALL FACE RUIN.

214
01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:02,458
- COME LUKE, SURELY THE
DEPTH OF YOUR HATRED

215
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:04,291
FOR THE NOBILITY HASN'T GROWN?

216
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:06,500
- I'M SORRY...

217
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:07,625
IT'S JUST WHEN I THINK OF
ALL THE INJUSTICES

218
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:10,291
CAPTAIN MILK
ENDURED AT THEIR HANDS...

219
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:13,083
- SHE WAS TAKEN IN FROM
AN ORPHANAGE, WASN'T SHE?

220
01:11:13,166 --> 01:11:14,708
PEOPLE SAY THE CALLAUDS
SOUGHT TO PUT THEIR

221
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:17,166
MILITARY EXPERTISE ON DISPLAY.

222
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:18,875
AND SO THEY FORCED
EXTENSIVE TRAINING

223
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:21,791
ON THEIR OWN,
CAPTAIN MILK INCLUDED.

224
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:25,666
- Luke: YES. I DON'T BELIEVE
SHE'S EVER KNOWN TRUE HAPPINESS.

225
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:27,625
NOT UNTIL NOW, THAT IS.

226
01:11:27,708 --> 01:11:29,625
THIS IS HER FIRST TASTE OF JOY.

227
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:31,833
- RIGHT NOW, WE MUST
NOT ALLOW MILK

228
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:34,500
TO REMAIN IN
THIS COUNTRY, LUKE.

229
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:36,208
- I UNDERSTAND.

230
01:11:36,291 --> 01:11:38,875
TURMOIL IS UPON US, AND I WILL
DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER

231
01:11:38,958 --> 01:11:42,291
TO SHIELD AND
PROTECT HER FROM IT.

232
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:44,166
- HEY, WHO'S DOING
THE COOKING TODAY?

233
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,791
- EH, LET'S JUST LET MOE DO IT.

234
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:47,541
- NO FAIR!
I ALWAYS DO IT!

235
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:48,916
- Lach: WELL, THAT'S 'CAUSE
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

236
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,125
WHO KNOWS HOW.

237
01:11:50,208 --> 01:11:52,000
- RYNER.

238
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:56,208
WHEREVER YOU ARE, MARK MY WORDS.
I'M COMING TO SAVE YOU, OKAY?

239
01:12:03,708 --> 01:12:05,500
- ( Arua crying )

240
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:06,416
- Kalti: ARE YOU GOING
TO FIGHT BACK,

241
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,541
OR ARE YOU GOING
TO LIE THERE,

242
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:09,291
YOU LITTLE DEMON?

243
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:10,208
- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
SUCH A SMART IDEA

244
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:11,166
TO PROVOKE THE THING.

245
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:13,041
WHAT IF WE MAKE IT ANGRY?

246
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:13,916
- THAT'S THE POINT OF
THESE EXPERIMENTS,

247
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,625
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS, RIGHT?

248
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:18,958
- YOU LEAVE US NO CHOICE.

249
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:20,958
- ( Arua screams )

250
01:12:21,041 --> 01:12:23,208
- AW, THE LITTLE WRETCH
IS SQUIRMING.

251
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:26,208
DOES IT HURT?
THEN BEG FOR YOUR LIFE.

252
01:12:26,291 --> 01:12:28,833
ASK SAINT CHEZO KALTI FOR MERCY.

253
01:12:28,916 --> 01:12:30,541
BEG HIM TO PUT YOU
OUT OF YOUR MISERY,

254
01:12:30,625 --> 01:12:31,750
YOU LITTLE BEAST!

255
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:33,000
- ( Arua screams )

256
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:34,500
- ( men grunting )

257
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:39,666
- OH, HOW VERY DULL.
HURRY UP AND DO SOMETHING!

258
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:41,125
- HOW LONG CAN HE ENDURE THIS?

259
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:44,000
CALM DOWN.

260
01:12:44,083 --> 01:12:47,208
EVEN IF WE TRIED, WE WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO SAVE HIM NOW.

261
01:12:47,291 --> 01:12:49,208
REMEMBER, THEY'RE MAGIC KNIGHTS.

262
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:51,125
WE NEED TO FORMULATE
A PLAN FIRST.

263
01:12:56,333 --> 01:12:58,083
- APPARENTLY YOUR
SURVIVAL INSTINCTS

264
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:00,833
AREN'T ENOUGH
TO SPUR YOU ON.

265
01:13:00,916 --> 01:13:02,625
- NO, PLEASE. MOMMY.

266
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:10,500
( Arua groans )

267
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:14,083
- ( men laughing )

268
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:20,041
- ( breathing heavily )

269
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:29,250
- ( Arua crying )

270
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,333
PLEASE, MOMMY. WAKE UP!

271
01:13:34,166 --> 01:13:35,583
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?

272
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:39,083
- RYNER!
- MOMMY, NO!

273
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:45,416
- YOUR MOTHER BROUGHT
EVIL INTO THIS WORLD,

274
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,750
AND FOR THAT,
SHE PAID WITH HER LIFE.

275
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:51,250
LOGIC DICTATES YOUR FATHER HAS
COMMITTED THE SAME EXACT SIN!

276
01:13:57,583 --> 01:13:58,625
- ARUA.

277
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:00,291
- DADDY! THEY KILLED HER!

278
01:14:00,375 --> 01:14:02,291
THEY MURDERED HER
AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT!

279
01:14:02,375 --> 01:14:06,125
- DON'T SAY THAT, ARUA. IT'S
NOT YOU. THIS ISN'T YOUR FAULT.

280
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:10,250
IT'S THEM.

281
01:14:10,333 --> 01:14:13,166
THE ONLY REASON SHE'S DEAD
IS BECAUSE OF THEM.

282
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:15,416
MY SON, DON'T BLAME
YOURSELF FOR THIS!

283
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,666
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
DON'T GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT!

284
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:21,208
- NO, DADDY!

285
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:23,708
- DON'T DARE BLAME YOURSELF
FOR MY DEATH EITHER, SON.

286
01:14:23,791 --> 01:14:26,625
YOU LIVE. YOU HAVE TO GO ON.

287
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:28,875
- OH, WE'LL LET THE BRAT
LIVE ALL RIGHT.

288
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:31,291
AT LEAST UNTIL WE BREAK HIM
AND HE'S SERVED HIS PURPOSE!

289
01:14:31,375 --> 01:14:33,166
- Soldier: SIR!
WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!

290
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:36,958
- I OFFER UP THIS CONTRACT,

291
01:14:37,041 --> 01:14:39,791
TO BEAR THE WICKED SPIRIT BEAST
THAT SLEEPS WITHIN THE EARTH!

292
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:42,166
- RUN HIM DOWN!

293
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:43,833
- ( men groaning )

294
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:49,333
- Ferris: THROW DOWN
YOUR WEAPONS AT ONCE!

295
01:14:49,416 --> 01:14:50,541
FAIR WARNING THOUGH.

296
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:52,750
THE MONSTER YOU ARE
FACING IS A WILD BEAST

297
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:55,500
THAT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO ATTACK
MEN AND WOMEN INDISCRIMINATELY!

298
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:06,083
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU FOOLS?
HURRY UP AND STOP HIM!

299
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:09,875
- ( men grunting )

300
01:15:09,958 --> 01:15:11,250
- I OFFER UP THIS CONTRACT,

301
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:24,458
TO UNLEASH THE BEAST
THAT DANCES THROUGH THE SKIES!

302
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:27,041
- I IMPLORE THE GODS ABOVE

303
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:32,291
TO ENDOW THY SERVANTS
WITH THE DEMON-SCORCHING LIGHT!

304
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:34,833
- ( explosion )

305
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:49,250
- GET OUTTA MY WAY!

306
01:16:00,916 --> 01:16:02,208
- ( grunting )

307
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:07,208
- CALM DOWN, YOU FOOL!
I CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE!

308
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:09,958

- YOU SEE THAT?

343
01:18:28,166 --> 01:18:29,333
DIVINE RETRIBUTION FOR A PERSON

01:18:29,416 --> 01:18:31,791
WHO SOUGHT TO RELEASE
EVIL INTO THIS WORLD.

- STOP THERE! THAT BOY
IS OUR RESEARCH SUBJECT!

356
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:07,500
TAKE HIM AND YOU'LL BE
CONDEMNED AS HIS ACCOMPLICE

357
01:20:07,583 --> 01:20:11,500
AND STRUCK DOWN
BY THE WRATH OF HEAVEN!

358
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:15,500
- OH YEAH? AND YOU'RE THE ONE
TO CAST THAT JUDGMENT, HUH?

359
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:17,458
YOU, A MERCHANT
OF UNCHECKED CRUELTY,

360
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:19,416
DOLE OUT THE WILL OF THE GODS?

361
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,375
YOU THINK WE'LL RECEIVE
DIVINE RETRIBUTION

362
01:20:21,458 --> 01:20:22,666
BECAUSE OF THESE EYES?

363
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:23,708
- RYNER!

364
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:27,208
THEY'LL HAVE CALLED
FOR REINFORCEMENTS, LET'S GO!

- ( screams )

366

DAMN IT, DAMN IT, DAMN IT!

367
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:48,500
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?

368
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:51,125
DIVINE RETRIBUTION? SERIOUSLY?

369
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:52,458
IF THE GODS DETEST US,

370
01:20:52,541 --> 01:20:55,000
WHY THE HELL DID THEY
ALLOW US TO BE BORN?

371
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:08,166
IF THERE'S ANYONE
UP THERE, TELL ME!

372
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:12,500
WHY DID YOU MAKE
SOMEONE LIKE ME?

373
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:14,458
TO TOY WITH ME
FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT?

374
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:16,500
WHAT, IS THIS A GAME TO YOU?

375
01:21:18,166 --> 01:21:19,291
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.

376
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:22,833
GUESS WHAT?
WE'RE NOT TOYS.

377
01:21:22,916 --> 01:21:25,833
AND THIS LIFE'S NOT A GAME.

378
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:29,833
WE'RE LIVING THINGS.
WE ARE ALIVE, TOO.

379
01:21:29,916 --> 01:21:32,916
WE DIDN'T CHOOSE
TO BE BORN THIS WAY.

380
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,750
WE DIDN'T CHOOSE TO BE
BORN DEMONS. WHY WOULD WE?

381
01:21:37,666 --> 01:21:39,208
WHY WOULD WE?

382
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:43,333
WHO WOULD CHOOSE
TO BE CURSED WITH THESE EYES?

383
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:46,083
OR WHO KNOWS?

384
01:21:46,166 --> 01:21:49,250
MAYBE IT IS OUR FAULT?

385
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:50,416
IF THERE'S REALLY
SOMEONE UP THERE

386
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,666
WATCHING OVER
THE PEOPLE OF THIS LAND...

387
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:58,125
PLEASE, TELL ME,
TELL ME WHY I'M HERE.

388
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:15,000
- ( theme song playing )

389
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:46,125
- Ryner: AS FAR AS COUNTRIES GO,
ROLAND IS A REAL PAIN.

390
01:23:46,208 --> 01:23:49,083
IF YOU ASK ME, SION WORKS
WAY TOO HARD FOR IT.

391
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:50,333
FORGET ABOUT THE NOBILITY.

392
01:23:50,416 --> 01:23:51,500
JUST KICK BACK FOR
A LITTLE WHILE

393
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:53,916
AND TAKE A
HOLIDAY OR SOMETHING.

394
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,125
SERIOUSLY, GEEZ.
