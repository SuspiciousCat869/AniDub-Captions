00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,458
Okay, I'm going to activate it.

Here we are.

Excuse me, could you please stop
that? Those don't belong to you!

[NOZOMI crashes, groans]

15
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,958
[FUMI] Hey, what're you doing,
you nut job?

16
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,541
--[camera clicks]
--[NOZOMI groans]

17
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:06,208
[YUKINA] Huh?
Oh, huh! That's weird.

18
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,708
Oh, hey! I know you.
You're Yukina, right?

19
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,833
[YUKINA gasps] Noriko!

20
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,250
[NOZOMI] I don't understand
what that means.

21
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,083
What's "Communal property"?

22
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,666
Any unattended vehicles
are confiscated.

23
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,000
We repaint them to match

24
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,625
the vibe and the scenery
here in town,

25
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,833
and then they become
rental vehicles for sightseeing.

26
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,791
No fair! We only left them
because some people thought

27
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,791
we were thieves
and had us wrongly arrested.

28
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,291
Come on, Mom. I told you
what happened, didn't I?

29
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,541
Please give their bikes back.
They need them more than we do.

30
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,750
If they're gonna run, repainting
them is their best bet.

31
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,833
[BOTH] Huh?

32
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,583
The way they look now,
they stand out

33
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,375
and they'll give em away.
I can fix that.

34
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,625
I think she's got
a pretty valid point there.

35
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,291
I think she just wants
to paint them.

36
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,750
Another bowl, please!

37
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:52,125
Noriko. I've been
wondering something.

38
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,125
Why do you believe
we're innocent

39
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,750
when no one else seems to?

40
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:59,458
Mmm. If you ask me, there's
no way you could've stolen

41
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,750
that stone from the captain.
Nobody could.

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,458
Anyway.
How do you know this kid?

43
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,041
And why'd you take your sweet
time coming to help us out?

44
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,750
She looked so different
from last time,

45
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,500
I didn't realize it was her.

46
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,458
She's changed a lot.

47
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,375
When we met before,
her hair was longer,

48
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,416
and she wore glasses
and a cute dress.

49
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,875
[YUKINA] Thank you, by the way,
for helping me before.

50
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:24,208
What happened? You seem a little
gloomier than you did back then.

51
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,625
[YUKINA]
Oh, I do? Really?

52
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,500
[CHIAYA]
Hey, what is that?

53
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,583
[GIRLS] Huh?

54
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,833
[YUKINA]
Oh, I drew that to thank them

55
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,833
for their help
last time I was here.

56
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,166
Who knew we were traveling
with an artist?

57
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,250
So, what's it of?

58
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,500
What do you mean?
It's a portrait.

59
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,750
Of who?

60
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,041
Well, of these guys, obviously.

61
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,500
[nervous chuckling]

62
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,583
[NOZOMI] So, that must be
your dad, then?

63
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,583
[NORIKO] Oh, that guy?
He's a novelist

64
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,666
who was crashing
at our place for a bit.

65
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,625
It's hard to believe, but he'd
been a vigilante squad captain,

66
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,833
and he was the first pilot
of the Tokyo Tower Robot.

67
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,250
[AI and NOZOMI] Wow.

68
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:04,000
[YUKINA] You know, it does
look like you're related.

69
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,666
[NORIKO] Yeah.

70
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,166
He's not here anymore?

71
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,041
No, he left on a journey.

72
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,958
As the founder of Always Comima,
he was treated as a god,

73
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,833
but really he was
a terrible writer.

74
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,250
I don't know if he ever sold

75
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,291
a single one
of his novels, honestly.

76
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,541
[gasps]

77
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,916
What is it, Mom, what's wrong?

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,791
Wait just a minute,
don't tell me that he's the one.

79
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,208
--What do you mean?
--The person who took the stone.

80
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,291
Do you think it could
possibly be him, darling?

81
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,416
--[GIRLS gasp]
--Mr. Akutabi? No way!

82
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,958
I know it sounds crazy,
but think for a second.

83
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,333
The warnings were written
on gridded paper, right?

84
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,333
Remember how he wrote
his manuscripts by hand?

85
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,083
--He was always scribbling.
--[NORIKO] Uhh...

86
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,083
Uh. Yeah, you're right. He was.

87
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,041
Maybe he joined up
with the Bombers.

88
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,583
He could be lashing out because
of how badly his novels did!

89
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,708
Well, honey. I don't know
if I would go that far--

90
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,166
No! It makes perfect sense, Mom!

91
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,833
Anyway, this has nothing
to do with you four.

92
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,708
We know
that you guys are innocent.

93
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,083
You should get outta here
before they catch you!

94
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,333
--Why?
--[NORIKO] Trust me on this.

95
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,833
You don't wanna get caught.

96
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,583
They'll torture you
'til you confess.

97
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,875
[NOZOMI] But, what happens
if we don't confess?

98
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,333
[NORIKO]
Oh, you will.

99
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,333
You don't understand.

100
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,708
Stealing is as serious a crime
as murder, here, anyway.

101
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,416
In consumer-driven
Always Comima,

102
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,625
things are as important--
[scoffs]

103
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:22,000
no, things are more important
than people's lives.

104
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:26,208
So you mean, "capital
punishment" is actually...

105
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,583
[whimpers]

106
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,083
[NORIKO]
As decreed by the Knights,

107
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,833
those given capital punishment
are sent into the building

108
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,250
where the festival began.

109
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,375
[TRIO]
And then what happens to you?

110
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,208
Once inside,
you're condemned to servitude.

111
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,625
You work every day:

112
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,875
the men dressed up as butlers
and the women as maids.

113
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,500
--[TRIO whimper]
--[NORIKO] To this day,

114
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,625
no one has ever returned.

115
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,000
Lucky for you,

116
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,708
I'm friends with the girl
at the south checkpoint.

117
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,541
I can have her hide
your departure,

118
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,083
at least 'til morning, anyway.
That should give you time to--

119
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,166
--No! Thank you, but no.
--You're kidding!

120
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,416
What are you saying?

121
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,833
Go if you want,
but I'm gonna stay here.

122
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:02,583
I don't intend to leave
until the captain believes us.

123
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,666
I can't just let her keep
Chi's stone. It isn't right.

124
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,416
I don't think
that's going to happen.

125
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,666
We should accept
whatever help she'll give us.

126
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,083
Yeah, forget about it.

127
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,166
We'll find a new stone
for Chi-Chi someplace else.

128
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,750
We can't run away like that!

129
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,875
It would be as good
as agreeing that we're guilty.

130
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,416
Like I said,
don't think of it as running.

131
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,958
We're just leaving until
I get stronger, and--

132
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,666
And if you don't get
any stronger? What then?

133
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,166
Why can't you just believe
that I will, huh?

134
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,458
Why can't you just believe
that we'll prove our innocence?

135
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,666
That's so naive!

136
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,375
We can't give up!
I know Masa wouldn't!

137
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,125
'Cause she's strong enough
to fight back!

138
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,375
Determination's more important
than strength!

139
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,208
[whimpers]

140
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,958
Anyway, that's probably how
she got stronger, you know?

141
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,500
[CHIAYA crying]

142
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:50,958
I didn't...

143
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,541
I didn't steal it.

144
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:59,166
But even though it's mine,
she won't give it back.

145
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,666
[sighs]

146
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,791
[no discernible dialog]

147
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,041
[MOMIYAMA]
So this is what it was all for?

148
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,666
It must be something
you wanted very badly

149
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,958
to sell those stones, but you
don't look all that happy.

150
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,416
You're wrong. I am happy.

151
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,166
You may not get it,
but I love him.

152
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,208
His story and hairstyle
were pretty strange,

153
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,750
so he wasn't all that popular.
But he kept on working hard,

154
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,416
and he refused to lose heart.
He risked his life

155
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,291
protecting people who needed it,
accepting no reward in return.

156
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,666
That's fascinating.
He sounds like a good guy.

157
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,375
And that's not all, either!

158
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,875
He only ever lied
about something one time,

159
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,583
so his partner
wouldn't take the girl he--

160
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,125
[gasps]

161
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:08,958
He's a good guy,
but still, he lied.

162
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,583
I'm sorry about this,
I really am, but I can't.

163
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,416
I'm not one
to casually break a deal.

164
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,583
The original agreement
was for one stone, right?

165
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,041
[AKI] Huh?

166
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,458

[gasps]

169
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,375
It'll be close quarters,
but you can use this room.

170
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,541
There are
extra blankets in the closet.

171
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,250
Oh, hey, this is the room
I stayed in before.

172
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,125
This is where we're going
to sleep? All four of us?

173
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,000
Why not? We can have
a pillow fight if we want.

174
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,500
A pillow fight?
I've never heard of that.

175
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,833
No, you gotta be kidding!

176
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,958
Pillow fights are
the best part of school trips!

177
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,750
Oh, wow!
This is like a school trip?

178
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,625
Let's calm down. We're guests
at somebody else's house.

179
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,750
Listen, I'm happy
to help you all out.

180

[CHIAYA]
With the pillow fight, you mean?

181
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:16,083
Not the pillow fight. I was
talking about with the captain,

182
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,625
about convincing her to let us
keep looking for the lost stone.

183
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,541
Mmm. Mm-hmm.
I'm fine, really.

184
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,375
Everything's going great.
There's no need to be worried.

185
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,708
Yeah. It's not like
I'm by myself.

186
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,958
Huh? Three other girls my age.

187
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,333
Why do you ask?
Dad? No thanks.

188
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,666
I don't see what I need
to talk to him for.

189
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,750
More importantly, I wanna know
how Masa's recovering.

Mmm. Mm-hmm.

That's something
I still don't understand.

--Huh?
--Yeah, What's with that?

206
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,958
Did you live nearby
or something?

207
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,708
[YUKINA]
I don't think that's it.

208
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,083
[CHIAYA]
I just found out, that's all.

209
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,291
But how?
How did you find out?

210

00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,625
I'm sorry, Captain. I brought
them here without permission.

215
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,625
But I believe them!
They're really innocent.

00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,500
--[AKI] I know they are, Noriko.
--Huh?

00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,250
--And I apologize.
--[GIRLS] Huh?

suspected you of stealing.

[CHIAYA]
You found it?

220
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,791
[YUKINA] Is that what happened?
Did you find your stone?

221
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,083
[AKI] As it turns out,
it was my mistake.

222
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,583
[scoffs] And you think
"sorry's" gonna cut it?

[NOZOMI]
That's fantastic!

224

And, since you found yours,

225
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,916
you'll give Chi
her stone back, right?

--[gasps]

[AKI]
I can't believe I did this.

228
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,041
That stone was a promise...

229
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,708
to protect the people
of Always Comima.

230
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:44,416
To safeguard their treasures,
and to ensure their happiness.

231
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,500
I carried that promise
deep in my heart.

232
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,708
It was so important to me.

236
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,541
Did I break it?
Man, I'm so clumsy!

237
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,458

are on the outside now.

about all the people
we're going to scare, ya know?

We're retaliating against them
for wrongs done to us!

This is payback.
Besides, it's not that bad.

[beeps]

[TATSUHIKO] Think about the
suffering they inflicted on us.

00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,333
Compared to that,
this is nothing!

us out. Akaru, I think.

What if she's there
when the thing goes off?

[scoffs] Well, I think
it would serve her right!

are the ones who warned us?

Is it the Dynamite Bombers?

271

They didn't call
themselves that, no,

272

but they were
from Higashi Murayama.

by the evil Takumi.

Apparently, all these guys
ordered was a prank toy,

but the manufacturers
threw in a bomb for free.

There's a bomb in the city?

exactly like a cleaning robot.

That's the power of the stone.

[NORIKO] The explosion
that started all this

341
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,625
was an undetonated shell
from the war.

342
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:41,708
I was on the investigation team,
and I decided to hide the truth.

00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,500
Instead, I invented
an anti-Comima organization.

Why would you do
something like that?

345
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,625
[NORIKO] Because... I didn't
want the captain to quit.

346
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,958
I wanted to keep protecting
Comima together forever.

I was so scared
when the captain's stone

really did get lost,
but it was too late.
