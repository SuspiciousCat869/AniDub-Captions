but they've got a past,
that's for sure.

319
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,041
[ALL]
Huh.

320
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,250
[car horn beeps]

321
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,166
Yo! What are you Rockers up to?

322
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,458
[ALL]
Hello, sir!

323
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,750
[GIRLS]
Huh?

324
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,916
Come here, Sheena, my pet.
How I've missed you!

325
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,041
Oi, easy, old man!
Hands off, all right?

326
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,250
Oi, ladies. So, Johnny,
where's Misa?

327
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,791
[JOHNNY]
Well, uh...

328
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,291
[MAN]
By Doji Shuten, huh?

329
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,708
[JOHNNY]
Yeah.

330
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,000
[SHIDO]
We were just about to stage

331
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,416
another rescue attempt.

332
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,208
Maybe I'm crazy, but,

333
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,958
is that Han-chan and Ma-bo
from Momiage Hammers?

334
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:07,958
[NOZOMI]
Huh?

335
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,333
Just look.
Check out the sideburns.

336
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,625
The faces do look similar.

337
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,958
[SHIDO]
Whatcha starin' at?

338
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,000
I'll bet I can guess.
Momi-Ham fans?

339
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,541
[HAN-CHAN and MA-BO]
Hmm.

340
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,708
[JOHNNY]
Han-chan and Ma-bo

341
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,583
started a record label
here in Kyoto.

342
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,458
Come back here
every year, they do,

343
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,833
to help out with
festival operations

344
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,250
and promotional-type things.

345
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,541
Ah!

346
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,416
[NOZOMI]
Thank you! This is amazing!

347
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
So, um, what about
your lead singer?

348
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,083
Is Momizo doing well?

349
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,500
--[groaning]
--[NOZOMI gasps]

350
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,708
Shut it.
We don't talk about that.

351
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:37,708
Uh...

352
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,208
Bloody stupid chit, are you?

353
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,916
Don't you know why
Momi-Ham broke up?

354
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,708
I heard they had hammer
differences. Serious stuff.

355
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,708
Because Momizo was the only one

356
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,708
who shaped his sideburns
into pickaxes, right?

357
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,708
They're still a touch sensitive
about the whole thing, right?

358
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,416
So I'd shut your gobs
if I were you.

359
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,833
So, what're you
going to do about it?

360
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,166
[ALL]
Huh?

361
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,291
You could launch an attack
on Mount Oe right now,

362
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,791
but you wouldn't have time
to prep for the festival.

363
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,250
And besides that, you still need
to replace the band members

364
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,708
who landed themselves
in those hospital beds.

365
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,041
If the Maikos are already
taking care of it, well,

366
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,500
why not just leave it to them?

367
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,666
Because then we'd owe them.
And stuff that, yeah?

368
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,666
Don't worry!
We'll figure out something,

369
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,083
I know we will!

370
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,291
You can concentrate on
preparations for the festival.

371
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,083
Whatcha mean by "something"?
That's not too specific.

372
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,666
Well, you know...

373
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,125
[SHEENA]
Haven't even got a plan?

374
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,375
Oh, hey! The stone!
Give it to us now!

375
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,375
Uh--

376
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,708
[AI]
It'll just be like you're

377
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,041
paying us in advance.
That's no problem, right?

378
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,708
[MOMIYAMA]
It took awhile,

379
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,083
but I caught up to them.

380
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,458
It appears that
Chiaya passed through

381
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,791
the checkpoint yesterday.

382
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,291
I got a look at her
customs clearance history.

383
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,208
For now it looks like
she's still travelling

384
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,583
with those other three girls.

385
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,000
[HARUKA]
The ones who like to say they're

386
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,000
filling in for Maccha Green,

387
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,291
even though they don't seem
to accomplish anything?

388
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,375
If that's the case,
then they should be with

389
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,333
the Kamogawa Rockers in Kyoto.

390
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,500
Bring her back.

391
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,791
[MOMIYAMA]
Yes, ma'am.

392
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,083
One more thing.
If you're in Kyoto, anyway...

393
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,416
[MOMIYAMA]
Do you want yatsuhashi?

394
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,375
[HARUKA]
Mmm.

395
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,750
[MOMIYAMA]
I'll also touch base

396
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,250
with our operatives in the field

397
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,791
to see if I can figure out
why we have

398
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,375
no Cores in our possession.

399
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,416
We should have accumulated
some of them by now.

400
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,250
[HARUKA]
Be quick about it.

401
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,583
Why won't she come back?

402
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,833
[CHIAYA]
I've made some friends

403
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,125
since I've been away.

404
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,916
[WOMAN]
I'm afraid I can't accept

405
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,375
what happened last night.

406
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,791
We involved ourselves
in a confrontation

407
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,666
at a concert hall,
an area outside our purview.

408
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,833
I can see your point,

409
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,000
but kidnapping is
rather a serious crime.

410
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,291
Not truly serious.

411
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,666
T'isn't as if
Doji Shuten is a murderer.

412
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,291
The only thing he
ever wishes to kill is time.

413
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,625
Anyhow, you're
forgetting the issue.

414
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,208
It's absurd that Kyoto is
the "holy land" of rock!

415
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,416
I don't know, I rather fancy
rock and roll, myself.

416
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,833
Ugh!

417
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,583
Right. I take it back.

418
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,916
And what about you,
Captain Mamechiyo?

419
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,083
Do you hate rock, as well?

420
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,583
Uh...

421
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,375
Well, yes!
Of course I hate it!

422
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,625
Care to fill me in
on what you're planning?

423
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,916
Everybody knows Doji Shuten
enjoys a good fight now n' then.

424
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,583
You never did
strike me as the sort

425
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,333
who would want to do
any real harm before, though,

426
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,375
or was I wrong?
What's your game?

427
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,291
You're right, luv. I do enjoy
watching a good fight,

428
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,166
and a match between the captains
of the Maikos and the Rockers

429
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,666
is a good way to kill time.

430
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,666
[MISA]
Well, I can't say

431
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,916
I share your opinion on that.

432
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,875
[SHUTEN]
I was wondering

433
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,083
what she would be like.

434
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,458
And I can't say
that I'm disappointed.

435
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,041
Huh?

436
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,166
Just talking to myself.

437
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,166
You came all this way.
Won't you sing a song for us?

438
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,750
Huh?

439
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,375
Okay, so we just ask them
to give it to us

440
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,750
instead of dropping it in.

441
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,625
What, are you talking about
the jinxed stones?

442
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,166
Maybe. What are those?

443
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,583
[SHIDO]
There aren't any about now,

444
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,250
but nights after a good concert,
they rain right down.

445
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,208
There are even boxes
set up around town

446
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,208
for people to put them in,
matter of fact.

447
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,458
What a waste! Why's that?

448
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,916
[SHEENA]
They might be pretty to look at,

449
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,041
but those stones have been
considered unlucky

450
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,875
in Kyoto for a long time.

451
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,375
Not many people besides
the captain hang onto them.

452
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,708
All right! Let's get one!

453
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,208
What would you want
with one of those, anyway?

454
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,250
[yelling]

455
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,500
[SHIDO]
Oi, wait!

456
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,041
He said a whole bunch of them
come down after a good concert.

457
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,291
I wonder why.

458
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,875
Besides that,
I'd really like to know

459
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,625
what exactly the stones are.

460
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,083
[ALL]
Hmm.

461
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,666
[YUKINA]
So, let's say that

462
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,041
the stones enhance
neuron synapses.

463
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,416
Noticing the activation
of sympathetic nerves,

464
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,333
the basal ganglia
cancels signals

465
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,791
inhibiting body functions
sent to the muscles.

466
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,541
This allows people to exhibit

467
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,458
more than 100 percent
of their potential.

468
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,166
Additionally, to prevent
substantial damage

469
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,458
to bones and muscles,

470
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,500
the stones may also put
a coating on the cells.

471
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,750
Ugh.

472
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,291
I have no clue
what you're talking about,

473
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,000
but how would that help anyone
make super cool shachihoko?

474
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,250
Uh--

475
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,833
[YUKINA]
Uh, well,

476
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,541
I'm not sure
how to explain that.

477
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,333
We need to keep
an eye on that box.

478
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,750
Hey! There are
stones coming down!

479
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,916
Really? I don't see them.

480
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,875
Oh, um...
What about over that way?

481
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,791
Oh, hey, we've got a live one!

482
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,541
[ALL gasp]

483
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,750
Wait, sir! Please come back!

484
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,708
[whimpering]

485
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,875
[AI]
Nozomi!

486
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,166
Get him!

487
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,416
[HAN-CHAN]
So, Johnny,

488
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,208
you wanted to be
a guitarist, right?

489
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,083
[JOHNNY]
Too right!

490
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,958
But I can't play an F chord.

491
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,000
[MA-BO]
And Marukome,

492
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,458
you wanted to be a drummer?

493
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,083
Love to.
Except I haven't got any rhythm.

494
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,333
[SHIDO]
I know, maybe the captain

495
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,875
can play bass while she sings.

496
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,291
[SHEENA]
Not a bad idea, that!

497
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,458
Momi-Ham style!

498
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,375
[SHIDO]
Are we sure

499
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,375
those girls will be okay?

500
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:40,750
[SHEENA]
Now that I think about it,

501
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,750
you know who's managing
the jinxed stones?

502
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,375
Wait, this place is...

503
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,916
[AI]
It's the Shuten gang's hideout!

504
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,291
Uh. Hey, do you hear that?

505
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,041
[CHIAYA]
It sounds like music.

506
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,291
[SHUTEN GANG cheering]

507
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,083
[cheering]

508
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,500
Mmm.

509
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,916
[SHUTEN]
Well, captain,

510
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,625
looks like your ride's here.
Go home, then.

511
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,958
What? Why bring me here?

512
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,791
Did you just want
to hear me sing?

513
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,833
Don't worry, I'll see you again
at the Rock Explosion.

514
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,541
I'll be the one
stirring things up.

515
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,666
[SHUTEN]
I hear that you have

516
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,541
some interesting things planned.

517
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:30,708
Oh?

518
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:31,875
[SHUTEN]
Involving the captain

519
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,708
of the Kamogawa Rockers.

520
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,875
Indeed. You know about that?

521
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,166
[SHUTEN]
There's been speculation

522
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,458
for a long time now

523
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,208
that Maikos, We Are
hate the Kamogawa Rockers,

524
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:44,166
but for your part,
I think it's personal.

525
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,541
Are you harboring
a private grudge or something?

526
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,000
The captain...
is not a nice person.

527
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,500
If you'd like,
I can get involved.

528
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:54,666
[MAMECHIYO]
Huh?

529
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,875
However, you should know
I don't hold back

530
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,416
when it comes to killing time.

531
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,333
[SHUTEN]
Is that all right?

532
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,875
That sounds acceptable, yes.

533
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,041
[SHUTEN]
Well, evil Takumis,

534
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,875
is your work here complete?

535
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,875
You took care of the other
Takumis without anyone noticing?

536
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,125
[chuckles]

537
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,333
I'll give you this much.
You blokes don't mess around.

538
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,291
I wager even Buddha
would be surprised

539
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,875
that those are
missiles up there.

540
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,708
I think this should prove

541
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:29,750
a satisfactory cure for boredom,
don't you?
