00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,583
[MOMIYAMA]
Stolen? That's unfortunate.

165
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,041
[AKI]
By the time I received

166
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,791
the warning note,
it was already gone.

167
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,208
Looks to me like
this was written on

168
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,000
old-fashioned gridded
writing paper.

169
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,000
I take it it's from
the Dynamite Bombers again?

170
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,375
[AKI]
I won't let them

171
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,916
get away next time!

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yes, well,
regardless of your intentions,

173
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,583
until these people are caught,

174
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,791
you won't be able to give us
the stone as per our agreement.

175
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,000
If you manage to
retrieve it from them, however,

176
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,208
I'm prepared to keep
my end of the bargain.

177
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,750
Those dirty bastards.

178
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,375
It's time I put a stop
to their mischief!

179
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,416
[FEMALE GUARD]
Lemme see yer passports.

180
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,375
Hmm. Huh.

181
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,916
You seem nervous.

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,916
Y'all wouldn't happen to be
Dynamite Bombers, would ya?

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,125
[NOZOMI]
Huh?

184
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,875
You know, those guys
that caused all the fuss

185
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,166
about six months ago.

186
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,958
The Knight Squad captain
had somethin' important

187
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,416
stolen from her this mornin',
so we gotta be extra careful

188
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
about what kinda folks
we let in here.

189
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,750
Interesting accent
for someone in the city.

190
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,166
Probably because
she's a checkpoint worker.

191
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,791
Most of them are
assigned from countries

192
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,041
that have no vested interest
in local affairs.

193
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,208
Huh. What's the Knight Squad?

194
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,625
[GUARD]
Here.

195
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,500
[sighs] This'll give ya
all the information ya need.

196
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,291
Their full name is
the Knights of the Twin Towers.

197
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,875
They're the state
vigilante squad

198
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,958
who do the peacekeeping
in Always Comima.

199
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:49,208
Wow!
Is their captain really strong?

200
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,708
[GUARD]
Well, yeah. Of course she is.

201
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,833
A Best with a backbone of iron,

202
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,875
which ya wouldn't expect,
given how tiny and cute she is.

203
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,125
[AI]
Ugh.

204
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,666
It's kinda hot
and gross here, huh?

205
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,625
[grunts]
Strange cloud.

206
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,000
[YUKINA]
Oh, that?

207
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,083
Around here it's called
the Comima Cloud.

208
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,791
The festival is a non-stop,
year-round thing.

209
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,791
I heard the Cloud is created
by all the body heat.

210
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,458
It keeps growing.

211
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,250
In the past,
the festival was only held

212
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,541
in that big building there.

213
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,708
I can see why
people would want to leave.

214
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,041
I mean, come on.

215
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,750
You have to admit, though,
it is a little cute.

216
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,583
Hey, Nozomi, look! Over there!

217
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,916
Huh?

[BOTH GIRLS]
Huh?

223
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,708
I wanted to ask you about that

224
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,041
heart-shaped stone
you're wearing.

225
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,416
[GIRL 2]
Stone?

226
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,208
Oh wait, are you talking about
her security charm?

227
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,458
Cute, right?

228
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,208
They have them on sale
for general use, too.

229
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,416
[NOZOMI]
Security charm, huh?

230
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,041
I guess I jumped the gun
on that one.

231
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,666
I'm sorry about that.

232
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,958
It's okay.

233
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,166
Chi, go ahead
and show them your stone.

234
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,583
[NOZOMI]
We're looking for these.

235
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,291
That's why I asked
about your charm.

236
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,583

are the Dynamite Bombers,
are you?

We're not, actually.

Think you're tough enough
to take on Tokyo?

Where are your headquarters?
How big is your organization?

Since the bombing,

you've only given warnings
about your intended crimes.

Is that so?

262
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,083
Then would you care to explain

263
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,500
how you came to be in possession
of this Drom Berserker?

What are you doing with my Core?

Maybe your intention was
to thumb your noses at me

or the Knights with your theft,
but this isn't just an orname--

belong to Chi!

but even if you
aren't the thieves,

the fact that you have this
makes it clear

that you're aligned with them.

We told you we have
nothing to do with this.

make you my disciple.

00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:37,625
[AKARU]
I was waiting for

483
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:38,750
the price to go down.

484
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,416
Well you have perfect timing!

485
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,708
Right now I can give you a
special price of 50,000 Comima!

486
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,208
No way! That's great!

487
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,583
Whoa, wait just a sec!

488
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,041
Sell it to me!
I'll pay 80,000 Comima.

489
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,416
[MAN]
Oh. Uh...

490
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
No, wait! I'll pay 90,000!

491
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,083
I'll give you 100!

492
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,375
110!

493
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,166
Uh, then I guess I offer 120.

494
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,250
[AKARU]
150!

495
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,750
Ugh. 160. I offer 160.

496
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,750
[AKARU]
180,000!

497
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,291
[groans]

498
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,333
200,000 Comima!

499
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,083
[AKI]
Uh! Wait, please don't tell me

500
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,041
she's working with him!

501
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,416
Huh?

502
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,583
[cawing]

[AKI]
Troublemaker!

504
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,041
How'd you get out of your cage?

505
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,500
Come back here right now.

506
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,458
That's my stone!
But what is it doing in there?

507
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,166
Bird, were you
playing a trick on me?

508
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,750
Caw?

509
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,916
You weren't, were you?

510
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,583
It was my own
stupid mistake all along.

511
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,666
[cawing]

512
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,833
[MAN]
Thanks for your purchase.

513
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,166
I hope you enjoy it!

514
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,708
[NOZOMI]
I can't believe

515
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:55,708
it's night already!

516
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,208
"Capital punishment."

517
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,250
Do you really think
they'll execute us?

518
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,375
But that would be
ridiculous, wouldn't it?

519
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,041
I mean, just for
stealing a rock?

520
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,041
Um, hello, we didn't
actually steal anything!

521
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,416
Right, but we're dealing
with someone

522
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,916
who doesn't believe
anything we say.

523
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,958
That's the whole problem.

524
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,750
Yeah, it's hopeless, isn't it?

525
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,541
Hey! What if we escape for now
and try again another time.

526
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,500
That could work, right?

527
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,583
I don't understand.

528
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,625
[AI]
Simple!

529
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,083
We come back
after we get stronger.

530
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,708
Then we defeat that
pint-sized captain of theirs

531
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,625
and get Chi-Chi's
precious stone from her.

532
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,666
So, what do you say?
I think it sounds good!

533
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,791
And in this plan,
who fights the captain?

534
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,250
[AI]
That'd be me.

535
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,041
And how are you going to get
strong enough to do that?

536
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,583
[AI]
I'll go train somewhere.

537
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:34,875
[YUKINA]
Um.

538
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,250
Well, I'm all for
the escaping part, at least,

539
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,833
but they took our passports away
when they grabbed us.

540
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,333
and we don't know
where our motorcycles are.

541
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,958
Don't worry.
We'll figure it all out somehow.

542
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,208
It doesn't work like that.

543
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,500
[NOZOMI]
Besides, I don't want to

544
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,458
run away when
we haven't done anything wrong.

545
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,541
[AI]
I wasn't talking about

546
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,791
running away.

547
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,916
Maybe if we just ask her
for a little more time.

548
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,750
I don't think ten years would be
enough time for us to find it.

549
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,458
There's no way if it was stolen
by those Dynamite Bomber people

550
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,666
she was talking about.

551

[NOZOMI groans]

552
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,041

So, what are we going to do?

553
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,625
Mmm!

[MOMIYAMA]
There's no doubting

567
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,291
that they're both authentic,

568
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,250
but why is it that
you have two now?

569
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,791
Anyway,

570
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,875
I was kinda hoping you could
give me the payment in advance.

571
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,166
Why's that?
Has the situation changed?

Well, yes.

573
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:42,625
It's not that I don't trust you,

574
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,458
but unfortunately
I can't do what you're asking.

575
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:45,625
Huh?

576
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,791
It's a matter of urgency
on our end.

577
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,541
In fact, I would ask that you
give me both stones right now

578
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:51,500
if at all possible.

What?

00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:54,041
[MOMIYAMA]
If you insist on

581
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,458
waiting until after you've
eradicated the Dynamite Bombers

582
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,500
to close the deal,
then the price,

583
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:01,375
actually the entire agreement,
would have to be reconsidered,

584
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:02,291
I hate to say.

585
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:03,166
