Ah! [screams]

2
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,375
[whimpers]

3
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,708
[MAMORU] You're ten years
too early to put

4
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,750
--a shachihoko on the roof!
--[whimpers]

5
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,708
That's how we advertise
the quality of our work!

6
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,625
Oh, calm down.
What's the big deal?

7
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,916
Everybody in this town
already has confidence

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
in the Uotoras' skill.

9
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,291
Well, I think it's cute.

10
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,416
Like father, like daughter.
Right, Hime, dear?

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,791
She has to start off
somewhere, I guess.

12
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,958
I wouldn't call
that thing a shachihoko.

13
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,166
How about we go
with "shachipoko" instead?

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,458
"Shachipoko," huh?
That's pretty good!

15
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,541
[laughter]

16
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,291
[DANDY] Don't worry.
It'll be good as new.

17
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,166
[YOUNG TOMOKI]
I don't care. I'm done.

18
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,416
[DANDY] Hmm?

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,666
I'm through racing.
I don't like it anymore.

20
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,333
[DANDY] Some days are like that.

21
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:23,416
I don't get it. You really like
shachihoko that much?

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,916
Yeah. I love them!

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,833
I'm gonna make the gold shachi
for the castle one day.

24
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,208
It's everyone's guardian god.
Did you know that?

25
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,416
Hmm.

26
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:35,041
You love them. Huh!

27
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,291
Hmm!

28
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:42,666
[gasps]

29
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:47,541
[gasps]
Wow! It's so pretty!

30
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,416
--Hey, I know! Here, have it!
--Huh?

31
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,916
You saved me when I fell,

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,291
so I want you to have
this stone. Thank you!

33
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:01,083
All right, then. I guess
I'll give this one to you.

34
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,791
No way! They look the same!

35
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,666
Go on, take it.
You helped me remember

36
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,125
something important,
so thank you.

37
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,833
--[giggles]
--By the way,

38
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:14,375
I call it Star of the Circuit.
What's yours called?

39
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,958
Uh... hmm... ah!

40
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:21,250
I'll call it Shachipoko Stone!

41
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,083
[HIMEKO] You're the captain
of the Motors?

42
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,541
That's surprising.

43
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,666
We weren't the ones who
broke the shachihoko, promise!

44
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,041
But I guess
it makes total sense

45
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,083
that we're being blamed
for it anyway.

46
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,208
Oh, and... I'm sorry.

47
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,458
Huh?

48
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,833
I used your name
without asking

49
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,125
to request assistance
from a peacebroker.

50
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,500
I couldn't let my squad
find out about it.

51
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,750
Guess that was
a waste of my time, though.

52
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,666
My plan was
to pay the peacebroker

53
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,250
using this stone.
I thought maybe,

54
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,583
with some luck from that
guardian god you mentioned--

55
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,125
Sorry. Since it was
a gift, and all.

56
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,416
It's okay.
You should have said something

57
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,833
when you gave me a ride
on that bike taxi of yours.

58
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,166
--Hello, and welcome!
--[TOMOKI] Oh. Yeah.

59
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,166
I just couldn't believe
how pretty you'd gotten.

60
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,333
--Huh?
--Oh! I mean,

61
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,333
not that you weren't pretty
before. It's just, you know.

62
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,708
--Right. Of course!
--Thanks for waiting!

63
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,375
It's so nice over here!
Getting cozy, I see!

64
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,958
You should skip the dating part
and go straight to the wedding!

65
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,000
Uh, yeah, please just
leave us alone, okay?

66
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,208
So, uh, it must be
a hard job being captain.

67
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,750
The rule is whoever's fastest
has to be the captain.

68
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,458
I'm just a figurehead,
that's all.

69
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,083
Fastest racer?
Then you were able to become

70
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,583
the Star of the Circuit,
after all?

71
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:09,833
Mmm. Oh, yeah.

72
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,541
Why isn't the star
riding any races lately?

73
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,916
--That's what I'd like to know.
--Yeah, tell me about it!

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,166
When you were
competing regularly,

75
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,833
it kept those guys
in line a little bit.

76
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,791
--[sighs]
--Enough about me,

77
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,791
do you know all about
making a guardian god now?

78
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,875
You went off on a journey
to train, right?

79
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,958
Uh, yeah.

80
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,708

We've been looking all over!

What's going on?
Oh my goodness.

00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,750
You're like ice!
Why're you so cold?

87
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,791
I'll go and get a hot bath
started for her.

88
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,625
Listen, Yukina, do you think
you can bring something ho--

89
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,375
Oh, Lord. Did we lose her, too?

90
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,125
I mean, I'm worried
about Chiaya, too.

91
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,000
But don't you think you've been
driving a little fast, Nozomi?

00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,250
I mean, we don--

93
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,666
What's that you're sayin'?

94
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,250
[YUKINA] Whoa, hey,
what's going on? Who're you?

95
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,125
[MAN] I could ask you
the same thing, sweetie.

96
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,125
[sighs]

97
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,875
[NOZOMI] Okay, you hold down
the fort here. I'll be back!

98
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,916
Yukippe's the one
who's gone missing now?

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,708
Won't she find
her way back eventually?

Yeah, hello?

103

This is Dandy's place.
How can I help you?

It's those Mie guys again.

You can bet they're to blame!

Are you the peacebrokers

in Maccha Green's place?

Where am I? I can't tell!

I'm sorry about this.

I really never thought
they would go so far.

120
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,125
[DANDY] Our people
were just as culpable.

121
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,541
[TOMOKI]
They want me to agree to a race

122
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,916
so we can decide this
once and for all.

123

[DANDY] A race fueled
by anger and hatred

124
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,708
won't help anyone in the end.
It would be futile.

125
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,625
[DANDY] I can't believe
that boy grew up to become

126
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:31,583
captain of the Mie Motors.
I was there. I cheered you on.

127
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,625
[TOMOKI]
That was nice of you.

128

It's been a while now
since you've raced.

129

Without you in it,
people don't get as excited

130
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,833
about the Grand Prix.

131
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,541
Racing just started
to feel so empty.

132
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,458
No one could compete
with me, you know?

133
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,833
Yeah, that is a shame.

134
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,500
Um, excuse me.
From what I can tell,

135
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,083
you two seem
to be on good terms.

136
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,708
If that's the case, why don't
you sit down as captains

137
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,041
and discuss how to make peace

138
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,500
between the people
in your regions?

these things work, right?

Is this the payment
for your services?

Um, apparently,
that was what was promised.

145
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,833
Then here,
go ahead and take it.

I'm the client here, aren't I?
So it's up to me.

Anyway, that stone
isn't something

I think I'm going
to need anymore.

That you, Hime?

[HIMEKO] Uncle, Auntie,
what're you doing here?

Your father. He was admitted
to the hospital last night.

[BOTH] Huh?

I loved shachihoko.

It was that simple.

00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,541
But as I grew, all I could
think about was how

to live up to Daddy's work.
