Ow!

Uh, sorry!
What I meant was

"diagonally from above
and behind you!"

345

[MOMIYAMA]
Our reports suggest

346
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,166
Always Comima has postponed
its expansion for the moment.

347
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,875
Which means
the recent disturbance

348
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,333
should die down
for a while, as well.

349
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,708
These were in the possession

350
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,125
of the two Bests?

351
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,083
Given how things worked out,
I'd say so.

352
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:00,541
It was
an exceptionally fierce duel.

353
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,500
Both only narrowly
escaped with their lives.

354
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,833
They'll need a couple of months
to recover fully.

[HARUKA]
I see.

356
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,166
Maccha Green
was seriously wounded.

357
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,125
You won't be conducting
any negotiations, then?

358
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,500
Why would I?

359
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,958
Considering that I was,
in fact, the original owner.

360
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,375
[HINAYO]
Why should you go?

361
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,208
These letters are
for Maccha Green,

362
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,916
not Nozomi Moritomo.

363
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,666
But Masami can't do
anything to help right now!

364
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,791
What exactly do you plan
to do out there?

365
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,208
How can you solve disputes
between other squads?

366
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,041
I don't know yet,
but people need help.

367
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,083
And they need it soon!

368
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,416
This one says they'll be waiting

369

at Aviation Memorial Park
tomorrow!

00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,166
Not another word!

371
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,250
There's no telling what kind of
trouble you could get into!

372
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,166
Finding out that Masami
is actually a Best

373
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,083
has already been
enough of a shock for us.

374
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,500
Let the vigilante squads
take care of it.

375
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,208
The can ask
another Best for help.

[NOZOMI]
Oh! Hey, Dad!

[HINAYO]
Welcome home, dear.

380
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,666
Now, Hina,

381
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,041
we let Nozomi get
her motorcycle license.

382
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,083
There was a reason for that,
wasn't there?

383
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,291
It's true there's
a lot of trouble in the world,

384
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,208
but there are also
great things to discover

385
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,458
and wonderful people to meet.

386
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,416
[HINAYO]
Huh?

387
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,583
[TOMOMORI]
We met because of

388
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,750
that motorcycle.

389
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,291
You haven't forgotten that,
have you?

390
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,458
[HINAYO]
Of course I haven't,

391
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,000
but Nozomi is still young.

392
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,500
[TOMOMORI]
Look, see this picture?

393

[HINAYO]
Yes.

395
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:21,958
That's from back from
when we first met.

[TOMOMORI]
All this time

397
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,625
and you haven't changed
one little bit.

Well, darling,
I don't know about that,

Really? You want to come along?

some traveling, anyway,
