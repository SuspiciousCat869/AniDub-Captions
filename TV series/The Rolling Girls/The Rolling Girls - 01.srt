00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,291
[NARRATOR]
Ten years had passed

2
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,208
since the end of
the Great Tokyo War.

3
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,916
The conflict's aftermath
was unresolved.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,250
Most of the country's leaders,
its ruling class,

5
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,666
and its wealthiest
members vanished.

6
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,875
Disappearing, it seemed,
into thin air.

7
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,875
Japan's newly reorganized states
divided themselves back up

8
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:49,708
into their old prefectures.

9
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,625
Except now,
they were independent!

10
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,291
Each region embraced
its own unique identity,

11
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,166
pulling away from the others.

12
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,541
It was a time of swift and
exciting change for everyone.

13
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,041
However...

14
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,875
the peace of this new age
was fleeting

15
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:10,750
Countless seeds of unrest
soon began to sprout.

16
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,583
A people who once understood
the value of community

17
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:17,833
began to prioritize the needs
of the individual.

18
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:20,166
Unity and cohesion
were quickly replaced

19
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,833
by isolation and exclusivity.

20
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:27,000
And then,
vigilante groups developed,

21
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,750
ostensibly to promote
peace among

22
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,833
and within the new nations.

23
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:33,125
But their violent roots
are still evident,

24
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:37,833
revealed as they slash their way
through the newly divided land.

25
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:44,208
Well, Peacebroker Maccha Green,

26
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,833
today is an exciting day.

27
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:47,875
After I'm done
wiping the floor with you,

28
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,166
I'm going to rip off
that mask of yours.

29
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,958
And then
that high-tech battle suit

30
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,583
will have a worthier owner

31
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,583
I think it's going to make
a perfect addition

32
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,583
to my collection.

33
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,541
[NARRATOR]
The Armed Empress,

34
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,250
Kuniko Shigyo.

35
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,375
It doesn't have to end this way.

36
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,333
We can resolve this with words
instead of with violence.

37
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,750
[NARRATOR]
Peacebroker-for-hire,

38
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,083
Maccha Green!

39
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,750
You're not serious, are you?

40
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,666
I am!
As we speak,

41
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,958
my squad members
are preparing a picnic.

42
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,041
We shouldn't waste
such a beautiful day fighting.

43
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,875
Let us drink tea
and discuss peace instead.

44
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,166
You have to be kidding me,
Tokorozawa punk.

45
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,041
You're the one
who picked a fight with us.

46
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,583
It's too late for talking now.

47
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:34,208
Villain of Higashi Murayama,
you threatened our safety first.

48
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,000
In the interest of justice,

49
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,375
President Misono abides by
the Twin Tower Declara--

50
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,416
[OTONASHI]
Yeah, yeah,

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,958
we know what
the Declaration says.

52
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,416
Fighting should be settled
by diplomatic means.

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,541
If not, then it's left up to
the representatives

54
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,083
of the state vigilante squads.

55
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,458
Now just shut up
and let Shigyo crush you.

56
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,833
Your time's over.

57
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,166
Higashi Murayama has merged
with the penal colony

58
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,625
of Tokyo kids from the north
of the old capital,

59
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,083
and we're ready
to make Tokorazawa ours!

60
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,333
Just surrender, okay?

61
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,500
Now this is the part
I don't understand.

62
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,708
As far as I can remember,

63
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,375
most people considered
Higashi Murayama

64
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,208
to be part of Saitama,
rather than Tokyo.

65
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,250
Your geography seems
a bit fuzzy.

66
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,458
[shouting]

67
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,916
Whatever!

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,750
We still want to say that we're
residents of old Tokyo

69
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,500
We don't want to be known
as some piece of Saitama.

70
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,958
[SUMIRE] You can be
part of old Tokyo, too.

71
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,166
Just surrender Tokorozawa.

72
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,750
Go on, surrender!

73
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,041
There, y'see?

74
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,041
Wait, wait, wait,
that makes no sense!

75
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,916
Aren't you already separated
from Tokyo?

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,083
Why can't we just leave
each other in peace?

77
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,416
[shouting]

78
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,416
Well, it's not like

79
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm doing this because
I actually care about

80
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,125
what happens
to these other people.

[gasps]

As a matter of fact,
the real reason I'm doing this

83
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,208
is you,
another leader for hire.

84

I want you gone!

into the northern corner.

00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,708
it's getting hard on her.

She went to pick up

that Best she knows
who's been helping out.

Do you know if her place
is very far away from here?

I'm not sure.
Seems like it.

she should really
take the train.

She's not the only one
who's busy.

I'm helping out, starting today!

Without the
Twin Tower Declaration,

[HINAYO]
And make sure

148
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,750
you do what Masami and the other
squad members tell you to do.

You're just an apprentice,
after all.

[NOZOMI] Not an apprentice, Mom.
A trainee.

to fights between Bests, either.

Calm down. I won't.

Nozomi, are you doing all this

154
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,041
just because you
want to be near Masami?

155
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,666
No, not 'cause
I want to be near her.

156
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,333
Because I want to help her.

We'll see you again soon, okay?

Ow!

163
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:54,458
I thought you said
you didn't want any.

164
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,833
Well. Let's see what
the damage is this time.

165
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,958

00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,416
Oh hey, I need you to make
more dango and taiyaki.

168
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,041
And some takoyaki, too!

Hey, Nozomi.

Nozomi Moritomo,

Nozomi, hey!

00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,833
[YUMI] What are you doing here?
It's dangerous.

I thought you guys
could use some snacks.

176

Oh! Dango from Moritomo!

Now, let's see
what this mask is hiding.

C'mon.

[MACCHA GREEN]
Stop it!

I can't breathe in here.
It's so stuffy.

I'm coming!

[MACCHA GREEN]
Need to get out.

193
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:03,250
But I can't, everyone's here,
and I thought I heard Nozomi.

194
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,666
This is Maccha Green!
Do you copy?

195
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,958
Hm? What now?

196
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,291
She could be calling
her other squadron members!

00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,416
--Huh?
--I think it's possible.

198
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,083
It's pretty unusual to see Green
working without the others.

She's got a robot with her?

203
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,833
There was no information
on that!

204
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,958
Well apparently the thing's
in "hyper" mode!

We'll deal with them
some other time.

Hey Masa.

213
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,375
You were supposed to be at HQ.
I said you could help

00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,583
with the beautification
of the city, remember?

215
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,916
Yeah, I thought I could do more
here, though.

216

You should always stay away

--Glad you're all right.
--Where's Maccha Green?

Oh, she's already
on her way home.

221
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,208
She did ask me
to tell everyone "hi," though.

222
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,166
[NOZOMI]
Where does Maccha Green live?

223
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,166
You went to pick her up today,
didn't you?

224
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,500
[MASAMI]
Huh?

225
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:13,041
Oh, it's, uh, near Kusunokidai,
or around there.

226

Oh!
That's really close!

I can go and get her
for you next time!

228
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:21,125
Yeah. Except she's really shy
about that kind of thing.

229
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,833
Really?
That's weird.

230
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,625
Well. Okay, then how about
I drive you to your house

231
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,791
right now? We can switch!

[MASAMI]
I'm fine.

233
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,416
That's more excitement
than I was after.

234
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,083
[NOZOMI]
That's mean!

235
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,833
I guess I am a pretty awful
driver though.

236
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,875
I really want you
to stop going to

'kay?

238
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,750
Fine. I mean, you got
Maccha Green and all

239
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,833
the other Propellers, so what
would you need me for, right?

240
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,041
Some puny Rest
who's no good for anything.

I have this with me.

[HARUKA] More jobs for you.
They just keep coming in.

250
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,208
I think it was the cease-fire
in the Mount Fuji ownership

251
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,000
rights case that really did it.
Brokering that arrangement

252
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,458
is what got Maccha Green known
in the west, as well.

253
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,291
Oh, that? Yeah, I heard it
was a feud between two girls

254
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,000
who were practically sisters,
so that one was kinda

255
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,416
second nature to me.

00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,041
Anyway, will you see to
these new jobs?

the Kitama Dangers, of course.

I expect great things from you.

similar about your voices.

317
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,750
Besides which, I've never seen
the two of you

318
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,791
in the same place.
Seems kind of strange to me.

319
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,291
Oh, that's just a coincidence.
She's really impatient.

320
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,166
She leaves me behind,
that's all.

321
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,250
Uh-huh.

322
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,250
Here's your ramen.

323
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,916
It looks amazing, boss,
thank you.

324
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,916
[explosion]

325
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,000
[MASAMI]
Okay, good!

326
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,791
It doesn't look like anybody
saw anything.

327
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,500
Still, I need to eat as quick
as I can and get out of here

328
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,416
before Shigyo does.

329
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,791
[SHIGYO]
Oh, yeah?

330
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,750
Good stuff, gotta-- huh?

331
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,541
[SHIGYO] Thanks, boss.
I'll take another, too.

332
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,750
[DEN-SAN]
Here you go. Your squad ID.

333
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,333
Here!
Your jacket.

334
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,916
--Oh, I...
--So Yukina,

335
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,416
I'm glad you were able to
find us.

336
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,958
My name's Nozomi Moritomo.
I'm a new squad trainee, too.

337
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,250
It's nice to meet you.

338
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,458
Uh, you, too.

339
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,875
[CROCODILE]
Just one thing.

340
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,375
Minors need permission
from their parents to join up.

341
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,500
So think you can
get this signed?

342
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,458
Well, uh, actually,
that's not why I'm here.

343
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,583
[honking]

344
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,583
Hey you guys? I think that bus
is out there for us.

345
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,916
I may vomit.

346
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,833
Thanks for the food.

347
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,583
[shouts]

348
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,958
Don't worry,

349
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,833
I don't count that
little contest as a win for us.

350
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,833
Give Maccha Green a message.
You can tell her this--

351
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:35,791
whoever's inside of it--
that precious little battle suit

352
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,791
of hers is going to be mine.
Soon.

353
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:42,500
Well,
see ya at the amusement park!

354
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,958
[engine revs]

355
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,750
No.
There's no way.

356
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,541
[screaming]

357
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,500
So, how did it go?

358
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,083
Went off without a hitch.

359
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,333
--That was amazing!
--I've always wanted to see

360
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,541
what this one was like!

361
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,916
I can't believe
we never come here.

362
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,166
It's so close!

363
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,916
I wish the captain
was here with us, though.

364
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,625
[CROCODILE]
Don't worry, she'll be along.

365
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,750
The two rookies
stayed behind to make sure she--

366
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,875
Wa-hoo!
Do you want to ride it again?

367
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,000
Sure,
sounds like a great idea.

368
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,916
--Nope. They're right here.
--It's okay!

369
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,875
I left a message back at HQ.

370
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,791
Oh well. What I'd like to know
is who the heck planned

371
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,083
this fancy amusement park
visit for us, anyway.

372
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,083
Yeah.
I guess maybe the captain did?

373
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:57,625
Hey! Check it out!

374
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,458
Hey, doesn't that look like?

375
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,583
Those are the guys
from Higashi Murayama!

376
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,958
The enemy Rest are now
entirely at our mercy.

377
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,875
This is totally the perfect bait
to trap Maccha Green.

378
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,458
[explosion]

379
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,916
[gasps]

380
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,166
Hey, what's going on here?

381
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,583
[screaming]

382
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:13,458
No matter how often I see it,
it's still beautiful.

383
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:18,500
This, you mean?

384
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,166
My good luck charm.
It's very precious to me.
