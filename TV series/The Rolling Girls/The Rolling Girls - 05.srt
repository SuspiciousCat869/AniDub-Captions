I call it the Moonlight Stone.

The Twin Tower Declaration

220
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,041
specifies
that vigilante squad captains

221
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,625
can settle disputes
with a fair fight.

222
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,250
But the duel you propose
doesn't meet those conditions.

223
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,375
As I see it,
there are two problems.

224
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,000
First of all,
you are not the captain

225

of the Mie Motors.

226
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,166
Secondly,
you taunted a peacemaker,

227
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,375
which shows a lack of fairness.

228

the fight they want.

He's trying
to convince his squad

that peace is best.

But how can a country

Actually, both dishes
have their origins in Mie,
