[NARRATOR] The land without
honor and humanity: Hiroshima.

2
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,625
The Nayotake Moonlight,
the vigilante squad

3
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,000
that had been responsible
for the land's protection

4
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,833
for many years,
fell victim to internal strife.

5
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,041
During the fight
over the succession

6
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,500
between the head family
and five branch families,

7
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:43,750
the squad weakened,
and public order degenerated.

8
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,333
[ISHIGAMI CLAN GUY]
Die, ya dirty bastard!

9
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,750
[OTOMO CLAN GUY] Think you
can mess with us, you scum?

10
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,625
Keep screwing with me,
and I'll tear ya to pieces!

11
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:54,125
There's no other way!
This is how it's gotta be!

[BOTH grunt]

13
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:01,625
[NARRATOR] As the sun
was setting on the old days,

14
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:02,916
a young woman appeared,

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,666
ready to change
how things were done.

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,708
Spitting on the chivalrous ways
of the yakuza,

17
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,083
this pirate girl gathered
her reckless crew

18
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:12,791
and soon governed
Okonomiyaki Village.

19
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,416
She is the captain

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,125
of the Ishizukuri Stones,

21
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:17,958
Shima Ishizukuri!

22
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,875
Meanwhile, the former
main family, Nayotake,

23
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,666
languished on the fringes
of the village,

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,500
struggling to keep
their name alive.

25
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:31,583
To top it all off, they were
in danger of being evicted.

26
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,500

--U-tan, wait!

--Uck! [coughing]
--[CHIAYA laughing]

30
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,791
The beach is nice and all,

31
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,666
but I'd like
to get going to Hiroshima.

32
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,833
We're headed
to an okonomiyaki shop.

33
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,416
That's the new client, isn't it?

34
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,125
Yeah, and they seemed to need
help sooner rather than later.

35
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,041
--[CHIAYA] Hey, Nonsuke.
--Huh?

36

You jerks! Ah!

00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,791
Uh... [sighs]

42
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,500
It's pretty out here.

43
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,166
[NOZOMI]
Like being at a planetarium.

44
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,500
[YUKINA] It'll be a full moon
before much longer.

45
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,000
We're getting to the end.

46
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,166
There's just one stop left
on the peacebroker's list.

47
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,583
--[CHIAYA sighs]
--[AI] I hadn't planned

48
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,750
on going with you
the whole way though, you know?

49
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,208
If only Nozomi
hadn't held back in Kyoto.

50
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,666
Do you mean the stone?

51
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,625
I couldn't have taken it
after what happened.

52
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,875
I mean, come on.
You were the one

53
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,458
who launched
the missiles, remember?

54
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,208
It's not like
I meant to or anything.

55
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,791
And it just made
the festival more exciting--

56
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,000
For something valuable,

57
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,500
there sure are a lot
of those stones around.

58
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,625
You'd think
it'd be the opposite.

59
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,250
Somebody did tell us the stones
were bad for your health.

60
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,875
[AI] I thought that was just
a silly superstition.

61
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,708
Hmm.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,166
It'll all be over soon.

63
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,458
[GIRLS] Huh?

64
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,791
Sorry, talking to myself.

65
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,416
All right, guys.
Let's get to sleep!

66
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,958
We're heading out
at 6:00 a.m. sharp!

67
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,083
[AI] What? That's basically
still nighttime.

68
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,041
[HARUKA] Do you have an update?
Do you know where she is?

69
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,791
[MOMIYAMA] Unfortunately,
I still don't know.

70
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:24,125
All I can tell you at the moment
is that she entered Okayama.

71
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,291
--[HARUKA] You're lying.
--Huh?

72
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,916
[HARUKA] You're lying to me,
aren't you? I can tell.

73
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,166
You're right, ma'am,
I apologize.

74
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,041
What do you think you're doing?

75
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,750
Encouraging her
to get her license?

76
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,375
Buying her a motorcycle?

77
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,250
[MOMIYAMA] Well, to be fair,
it was actually a hand-me--

78
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,708
That isn't the point,
and you know it.

79

[sighs]
Momiyama.

80
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,750
I get where you're coming from,

81
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:47,041
but she seemed
like such a lonely little girl.

82
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,458
She's doing so well
with new environments

83
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:53,833
and new people, but above all--
well, in all honesty,

84
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,041
I've never seen her
having so much fun.

The next full moon
is almost here.

This happens
once every 415 years.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,666
[MOMIYAMA] I understand.
I hadn't forgotten that.

89
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,375
[HARUKA] Gather as many stones
as you can as soon as possible.

90
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:13,750
And bring Chiaya back,
you hear me?

91
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,583
[MOMIYAMA]
Yes, ma'am, I do.

[SHIMA] Hmph. He's cunning,
I'll give him that.

94
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,791
[OTOMO]
What did Shuten do this time?

95
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,041
[SHIMA] Seems he's increased
the price per stone,

96
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,708
and he's not interested
in joining the project.

97
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,791
I'm not surprised.
That's how he is. Ah.

00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,250
Well, ma'am,
looks like they're here.

99
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,500
A good deal, as always.

100
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,666
Such a pleasure
doing business with you.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,375
You've checked out
the spot, I take it?

102
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,125
--Yes, ma'am!
--And who's going to do it?

103
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,333
I was planning
to take on that responsibility.

104

Well, let's have a look,
shall we?

105
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:10,750
From what I can tell,

106
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,416
the hidden room's
in the basement.

107
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,958
[SHIMA]
Yes, so I see.

[NOZOMI]
Aw man! It's already noon?

113
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,458
Why'd you sleep so late, Ai?

114
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,875
[AI] Not just me! You went back
to sleep, too. Hey, can we stop?

115
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,750
We were in such a hurry,
I didn't eat any breakfast.

116
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,166

Jeez!

this show on the road!

119

[gasps] Guys!
We almost left without having

120
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,791
their famous Kibi-dango!
That was a close one!

121

[GIRLS] All right, everyone!
Let's dig in!

--[AI eating noisily]
--[NOZOMI] Mmm!

--[CHIAYA] Um, Yukippe?
--[YUKINA] Hmm?

124
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,541
I was just wondering
how the rest of you can bear it.

125
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,000
Bear it?
What do you mean?

126
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,791
Do I have to say it?
Come on, you know.

127
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:24,833
Huh?

128
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,125
That thing
you turn into sometimes,

129
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,708
you know,
when you're not focusing.

130
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,791
It's something you're not
supposed to show other people.

131
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,708
Um... I'm so sorry.
What are you saying?

132
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,166
[sighs]
But we're friends,

133
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,291
so it's not really
that big of a deal, is it?

134
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,083
[chirps]

135
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,166
Uh...

136
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,250
[NOZOMI] Uh...

137
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,833
They're smaller than I expected.
Kind of a let-down.

138
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,291
Sure, go ahead.

139
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,833
Taking the last one never seems
to bother you, does it?

140
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,625
Huh?

141
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,208
Oh, did you want it?
I didn't know that.

142
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,958
Whatever. No big deal.

143
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,541
Uh. I would've let you have it
if you'd said something.

144
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,875
[NOZOMI, angrily]
Like I said, it's no big deal.

145
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,583
What's with you?

146
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,958
You could've eaten it
if you wanted it so bad.

147
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:20,125
[sighs] Well, Ai, we can always
count on you to be selfish.

148
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,166
--What?
--I mean if you hadn't played

149
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,458
so much at the beach yesterday,
you wouldn't have overslept,

150
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,333
and we'd probably be
in Hiroshima by now.

151
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,875
Hold on, what's that
got to do with anything?

152
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,833
Besides, you were playing
at the beach, too.

153
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,958
Well, maybe,
but that's not the point!

154
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,416
And why bring it up now?

155
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,208
It's not fair
to ambush me like that.

156
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,791
Mention it
when I can change something!

157
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:41,833
[scoffs] It's not like it's new.
You just do stuff like that!

158
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,666
--[AI] Stuff like what?
--Like, you know. I, um--

159
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,291
well, it's hard
to pin down one thing.

160
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,125
Oh, forget it.
This is getting stupid.

161
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,583
I'll just buy you another one.

162
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,375
Stop! This isn't
about the Kibi-dango!

163
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,375
If we're just airing out
our grievances, I've got one.

164
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,791
You act like your opinion is
the only one that matters,

165
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,291
like you're
the boss or something.

166
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,166
--[gasps]
--You're not my leader.

167
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,250
I didn't come along
to be your lackey. Seriously.

168
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,750
Sometimes you can be really
irritating, you know that?

169
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,500
I... [grumbles]

170
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,083
Um, you guys okay?
Maybe we should go.

171
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,291
U-tan, you shouldn't
say stuff like that.

172
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,250
Here, you can have
my Kibi-dango.

173
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,958
You've got it easy,

174
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,500
just sitting back,
enjoying the ride.

175
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:24,416
Oh! Oh, well,
sorry for not having my license.

176
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,291
But I still help out by looking
at the map some of the time.

177
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,125
Yeah, until you fall asleep,
and then you just get us lost!

178
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,666
At least I'm not
as bad as Yukina!

179
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,416
[gasps]

180
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,666
I thought you were
better than that, Ai,

181
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,166
but it's becoming pretty obvious
I was wrong about you.

182
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,958
Oh, yeah? What's that
supposed to mean?

183
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,916
Ever since you found out
the truth about the stones,

184
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,250
that's all you ever talk about.

185
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,833
You're the one
who's being unfair.

186
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,833
You wanna get stronger
the easy way!

187
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,916
Fine! But in that case,
all Bests are unfair!

188
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,625
You should have become a Best
from the beginning of all this!

189
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,250
Then maybe you could've been
a half-decent peacebroker.

190
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,333
It doesn't matter
how hard you try!

191
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,666
As a Rest, you'll never
accomplish anything!

192
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,125
[grunts] You don't know
what you're talking about

193
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,083
[CHIAYA] Hold on.
What are you doing?

194
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:13,083
[grunts] I'm gonna find
a stone by myself. See ya!

195
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,541
[YUKINA and CHIAYA] Huh?

196
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,208
Uh... [humphs]

197
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,208
Don't just stand there!
You have to do something!

198
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,583
--She's going to leave!
--So let her go. I don't care.

199
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,583
Obviously, I'm too irritating
for her to be around.

200
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,708
[AI growls, humphs]

201
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,500
[NOZOMI]
Let's go.

202
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,833
[GUARD] Just you three?

203
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,250
Where's your
other friend at, then?

204
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,750
[NOZOMI] I thought--
how did you know--

205
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,875
[GUARD] Bout yer numbers?
I can see here, plain as day.

206
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,166
You've been traveling
together awhile now.

207
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,458
So, didja get in a fight?
Little verbal rasslin' match?

208
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,125
[NOZOMI] Well, that's not
how I'd put it.

209
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,750
--[YUKINA sighs]
--[CHIAYA] Just three.

210
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:57,375
[GUARD] Well, welcome to the
land without honor and humanity.

211
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,791
You want my advice?

212
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,958
I'd tell you to eat your
okonomiyaki and move along.

213
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,541
--Come on in, have a taste!
--Best in Hiroshima, guaranteed!

214
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,500
[laughs] Ooh.

215
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,250
[sighs]

216
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,750
[NOZOMI]
Well, here we are.

217
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,000
--[door opens]
--[NOZOMI] Good afternoon!

218
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,291
--Come on in. Hello!
--Welcome. Have a seat.

219
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,500
Thanks,
but we're actually looking

220
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,375
for Ponta, Yasu, and Tsune.

221
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,625
Do those names
sound familiar at all?

222
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,666
We've got some young people here
by those names, in fact.

223
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,000
Mind telling us who you are?

224
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,833
[sizzling]

225
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,625
--It's so good!
--[CHIAYA] Mm-hmm!

226
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,250
There's more if you'd like it.

227
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,708
Kuramochi, don't you think
that's a little much for them?

228
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,416
Oh, it's fine! We've got someone
who can pack it away--

229
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,791
[CHIAYA and YUKINA] Mmm.

230
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,583
Uh. [gulps]

231
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,041
Well, not anymore,
but I'm really hungry.

232
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,333
[FUHITO] You just eat as much
as you want. There's plenty.

233
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,625
You've traveled so far,

234
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,166
you deserve
to be well looked after!

235
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,500
That's them there.
Asked Maccha Green to come, huh?

236
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,083
Probably wanted her help
with a raid, I would say.

237
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,416
[NOZOMI] A raid?

238
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,416
[FUHITO]
Yeah, like a surprise attack.

239
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,083
[GIRLS gasp]

240
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,333
[FUHITO]
Things weren't always like this.

241
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,708
In the past,
a chivalrous yakuza family

242
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,750
called Nayotake
hung their crest here.

243
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,750
Additionally,
it was the headquarters

244
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:25,333
of the state vigilante squad,
the Nayotake Moonlight.

245
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,000
[NOZOMI]
Oh, yeah? Really?

246
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,333
[FUHITO] They were forced
to relinquish control, though.

247
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,375
Unfortunately, pirates called
the Ishizukuri Stones

248
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,583
are trying to get that license
for themselves now.

249
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,000
They want to force us out
of this location,

250
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,125
so they can build a new landmark
for Okonomiyaki Village,

251
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:43,833
and Hiroshima's head of state
is allowing it by tacit consent.

252
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,083
--[gasps]
--That's not honorable.

253
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,750
When times change,
you have to change with them.

254
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,083
As you can see,
this young lady has been raised

255
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,333
to show respect
for ways of the past.

256
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,500
However, it is a good
opportunity to move out of here.

257
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,375
But your food is so delicious.

258
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:04,083
Ha! A takoyaki fan!
Want some more?

259
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,666
--Mm-hmm!
--[FUHITO] Coming right up!

260
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,750
Excuse me, is there anything
we can do to help you?

261
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,458
[FUHITO]
I don't think so, young lady,

262
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,583
but we do appreciate
you asking.

263
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,250
In the letter I think it said
the payment was this stone?

264
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,375
--Oh, um...
--A Core.

265
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,791
--We can't take it.
--[door opens]

266
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,375
[MOMIYAMA] Hello.
Pardon the intrusion.

267
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,250
--[FUHITO] Good afternoon.
--[KAGUYA] Please, come in!

268
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,583
--[gasps] It's Momiyama!
--[YUKINA and NOZOMI] Huh?

269
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,000
--Excuse me.
--[grunts]

270
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,375
Not so fast. There's something
you have to hear, Chiyaya.

271
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,750
Oh, ten orders of pork
okonomiyaki, please.

272
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,750
[door opens]

273
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,666
[MASAMI]
Hey, Shigyo. You doing okay?

274
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,291
I'm healing up. They said
I can leave once this is off.

275
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,083
Still in pretty bad shape?

276
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,541
[sighs]

277
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,958
[MASAMI]
She's faking it?

278
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,166
[OTONASHI] Her injuries
have already healed,

279
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,416
but she doesn't want them
to discharge her.

280
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,708
[MASAMI]
But why not?

281
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,375
I'd think it would
be obvious to you.

282
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,916
--She lost her stone, remember?
--Oh.

283
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,791
[OTONASHI] It wouldn't be good
for Shigyo if it became known

284
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,041
that she wasn't a Best anymore.

285
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,958
The people she hurt
in the past might decide

286
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,958
now's a good time
to settle some scores.

287
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,416
Uh... I'll see if there's
something I can do about that.

288
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,375
[whispers]
I'll talk to the president.

289
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,791
I bet she has some extra.

290
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,708
[OTONASHI]
President Misono?

291
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,083
She seems to be collecting them.

292
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,791
That's what she asks
people for as payment

293
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,750
whenever I do work
as a peacebroker.

294
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,416
[OTONASHI]
There's that many stones?

295
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,708
Enough for her to be making
a collection of them?

296
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,333
Well, just think about it.

297
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,041
At the very least,
there must be

298
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,708
as many as there
are Bests, right?

299
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,958
[OTONASHI] I guess you're right.
I wonder what they are.

300
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,583
[MASAMI]
I couldn't say.

301
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:54,083
All I know is they're mysterious
stones that fall from the sky.

302
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,041
[OTONASHI grunts]

303
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,958
[YUKINA] Chief Secretary
of the President of Tokorozawa?

304
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,541
I still can't believe Chi's
the president's daughter.

305

[MOMIYAMA]
You've been gone awhile now.

307
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,625
Your mother's worried about you.

308
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,250
Well, I'm not going home yet.

309
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,041
How did you find out about
the Cores in the first place?

310
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,500
I wasn't spying or anything,

311
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,125
but I overheard you and Mom
talking about them.

312
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,583
You said you needed
to gather a lot.

313
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,791
Then one morning
I found one, too.

314
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,666
I wanted to give it to her.

315
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,750
[MOMIYAMA] You thought
you'd help collect them?

316
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,041
Mm-hmm, but if we got
the stones, the trip would end.

317
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,208
I was having a good time,
so I changed my mind.

--Hey, Momiyama.
--Mmm?

319

Is having one of those stones

320
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,125
really what makes
somebody a Best?

321
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,458
And why does Mom want
to collect them so badly?

322
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,125
--You do deserve the truth.
--Huh?

323
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,583
There's so much
I need to explain,

324
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,458
so please just listen for now.

Thank you for stopping by.

326

[MOMIYAMA] I've arranged
a place for you to stay tonight.

327

Please wait there
until I pick her up.

328
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,291
I'm entrusting you

329
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,000
with the safety
of the president's daughter.

330
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,750
Don't give me cause
to regret that.

331
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,291
Right. Of course not.

332
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,625
There was a fourth girl,
wasn't there? Where is she?

333
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:13,625
Oh! Oh, we had a little fight.
It was nothing major, really.
