1
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,500
It's the end
of Hiroshima's false chivalry!

2
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:28,916
Say goodbye!

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,875
[ROBOT] Setup is complete.
Enter idle mode.

4
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,208
What's going on?
Why isn't this thing moving?

5
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,041
[ROBOT] Please insert
the Daimon coat of arms.

6
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,625
--Please insert the--
--Ugh!

00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,791
That lady's in trouble.
Let's go!

8
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,916
Huh? What are we gonna to do?
We're just regular people.

9
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:06,166
[MASAMI] There are stones
in the ship. We'll get a couple.

10
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,791
C'mon!

11
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,333
I see.

12
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,875
From the beginning, your plan
was to steal the ship back.

13
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,583
Aah!

14
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,250
[screeching tires]

15
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:32,625
[AI]
What's up?

16
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,166
Who's that lady?

17
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,875
Haruka Misono.
She's our president.

18
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:40,125
Chi, your mom's here!

19
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,333
Huh?

20
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,708
[HARUKA]
You should be at Momiji Island.

21
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,500
That's where you
were told to wait.

22
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:49,250
Well, one thing led to another,
and, you know.

23
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,875
You've spoken to Momiyama?

24
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,916
[CHIAYA]
Yeah.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,916
I was waiting for
the right time to tell you,

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,791
but I took too long.

27
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:02,083
I think I knew.
Or, part of me did.

28
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,416
I just had a feeling

29
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,333
there was somewhere
I'd go back to someday.

30
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,750
[HARUKA] There's no need
to return to Tokorozawa.

31
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,791
We'll leave from here
Come with me now.

32
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,375
We'll wait for the ship
at Momiji Island.

33
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,625
Thank you for
looking after my daughter.

34
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,708
Um, sorry,
but we're kind of in a hurry.

35
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:19,958
We can't stop now.

36
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,916
We've got something
important to deliver.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,125
[HARUKA]
Oh, you do? For whom?

38
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,250
Well, um...

39
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,083
The checkpoint lady!

40
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,541
Huh?

41
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,833
This is something I need to do.
We'll be right back.

42
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,625
Well, come on.
Let's go!

43
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,666
[HARUKA]
Just a second.

44
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,875
There you go.

45
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,500
Be careful, all right?

46
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,833
[YUKINA]
She never got to go anywhere?

47
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,541
[MOMIYAMA] Her mom was extremely
concerned about her health.

48
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,583
She was never
enrolled in school.

49
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,750
And on the rare occasions
she went outside,

50
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,041
she had to wear
a protective mask.

51
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,583
But it looks like
there was no reason to worry,

52
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,875
so now I wish she'd had
more freedom sooner.

53
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,083
Hey, do you mind if I give this
to her? I bet she'd like it.

54
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,875
Oh, um...

55
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,083
If I could just fix it up
a little bit first.

56
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,333
What would you fix?

57
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,666
I think it's perfect
the way it is.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,875
Hmm?

59
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,500
Oh. It's nothing.

60
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,625
Just, no one's
ever said that before.

61
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,208
It's nice to hear.

62
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,000
Really nice. Thanks a lot.

63
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,458
Give it time.

64
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,500
You barely have a callous
on your drawing hand yet.

65
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,083
Huh?

66
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,375
Do you know how you get
what you want out of life?

67
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,416
By refusing to give up ever.

68
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,958
Our band was
like that, actually.

69
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,083
In the beginning,
none of us were any good.

70
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,958
A little like the four
of you, I guess.

71
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:57,166
When people work together,
a strange power is born.

72
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,791
It can be amazing.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,333
[rumbling]

74
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,833
[groaning]

75
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,625
You're done, you hear me?

76
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,250
[rumbling]

77
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,125
The ceiling!
What's happening?

78
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,750
It's an attack!

79
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,666
Takumi Co.
and the evil Takumis!

80
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,041
What did you say?

81
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,791
Takumi Co. too?

82
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,666
It's likely the evil Takumis
proposed a cooperative effort

83
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,291
in order to get the shrine back.

84
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,083
They won't succeed! Return fire.
Do whatever it takes!

85
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,291
[ALL]
Right, yes, ma'am.

86
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,458
--Well?
--Number?

87
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,250
--What now?
--Let's get going.

88
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,166
Couldn't say exactly,
but there are a ton of them!

89
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,333
We've got them up here, too.

90
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,666
[shouting]

91
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,708
It's all coming down!

92
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,166
Hey, get back here!

93
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,541
--Just leave them.
--But Shima--

94
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,375
Heh. It's the same as before.

95
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,958
Actually, they're abandoning me
even sooner this time.

96
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,875
I'll go out using the Stonefish.
You protect the shrine.

97
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,250
Are you sure?

98
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,083
Maybe we should
just return it to them.

99
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,375
If we destroy everything,

100
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,500
then nobody else can
buy their automatons.

101
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,583
That would be better for us.

102
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,958
I don't know, ma'am.

103
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,500
You told me that I could always
count on you, Otomo!

104
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,291
We're just like lab rats.
And this is the laboratory.

105
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,833
We're being
watched all the time.

106
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,375
They give us basic rules

107
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,041
and then see how far
the human ego will go.

108
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,541
What is she saying?

109
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,041
Let's end this!
They need to be obliterated!

110
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,666
Crushed into tiny little pieces!

111
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,000
That's what this ship
was meant to do.

112
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,750
You're delusional!

113
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,208
The Twin Tower Declaration
is the only thing

114
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,541
that keeps us from
destroying ourselves with war!

115
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,875
Peace can be achieved through
a succession of small victori--

116
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,333
Why are Takumi Co. and the evil
Takumis allowed to exist?

117
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:57,833
Huh?

118
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,541
Because we're being tested,
to see how we'll use them.

119
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,833
That's right!
By them.

120
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,625
By the age we live in.

121
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,041
That's something
that doesn't change,

122
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,750
regardless of
the time or the planet.

123
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,750
Planet?

124
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:11,916
Huh?

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,750
Shima Ishizukuri!

126
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,916
Return what you stole
from the Takumis

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,375
and end this attack!

128
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,291
This isn't the same
as the last time.

129
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,000
Even if all the rest of them
have run away,

130
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,708
you've still got
somebody there by your side.

131
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,833
That's why I can't give it back!

132
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,625
I don't understand you!

133
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,916
Take the license back.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,250
Just forget about the ship!
Go on!

135
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,125
Ugh!

136
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,041

Whoa.

138
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,125
Hmm.

Oof!

141
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,583
[MOMIYAMA] Is that the sacred
Takumi Co. object?

142
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,416
If so, things will go
a lot easier for you

143
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,875
if you return it graciously.

144
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:18,000
Unfortunately, that isn't
something I can do.

145

[grunting]

146
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,666
Listen, you two. Take that
outside and wave a white flag.

147
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,416
[MOMIYAMA] If you do that,
this attack will end.

148
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,666
I can't do that!
What if I get lost?

149

"If you keep going,
you'll reach your destination.

"For now, just run!"

The chorus from
"Song of the Beginning!"

152
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,041
Now go!

153
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,833
Yes, sir.

Is she self-destructing now?

That woman is
crazier than I thought!

We have to stop her.

00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,708
Is that Otonashi?

164
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,833
Aah!

165
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,291
Otonashi!

166
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,333
[yelling]

167
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,666
Are you okay?

168
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,208
That you, Shigyo?

169
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,708
How badly are you hurt?

170
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,916
It is you!

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,083
Oh, I've missed you so much!

172
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,083
What? What's the matter?

173
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,833
[OTONASHI]
Your stone.

174
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,875
--But you--
--How'd I...

175
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,833
This whole time,
the necklace meant nothing!

176
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,916
[ROBOT] I said please insert
the Daimon coat of arms.

177
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,208
Please insert the--

178
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,375
[engine revs]

179
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,791
Where are we?

180
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,000
It's huge!

181
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,333
Hey, look!

182
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,000
Is that Nozomi?

183
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,000
Masa?

184
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,500
--Hey! Yukippe!
--Yukina?

185
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,750
Why are you all here?

186
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,583
Kaguya, hold on!

187
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:17,625
Oh...

188
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,500
Take this!
He said you put it in the robot!

189
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,125
[screaming]

190
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,458
Nozomi!
You okay?

191
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,583
The coat of arms!

192
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,083
Look for the pieces!

193
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,958
Hey!
There, Yukina!

194
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,750
Over by you!

195
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,208
Uh, where, exactly?

196
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,625
[CHIAYA]
There's one over there!

197
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,541
[HARUKA]
Please be okay.

198
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,041
[straining]

199
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,333
Got it, Nonsuke!

200
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,458
'Kay, pull us up!

201
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,750
[grunting]

202
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,666
Whew.

203
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,916
[giggling]

204
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,750
Here, take this.

205
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,541
Kuramochi said
to give it to you.

206
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,416
He called it the soul
of the Nayotake.

207
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,333
Thank you for bringing it.

208
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,791
[YUKINA] My guess is
that's where you insert it.

209
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,041
[ROBOT]
Daimon complete.

210
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,250
[BOTH]
We believe in you!

211
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,541
[laughing]

212
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,541
--Nozomi.
--Masa, you're here!

213
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,125
Are you all healed up now?

214
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,083
I'm fit as a fiddle.
How about you?

215
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,750
I'm just fine.

216
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,000
As long as I've
got my friends.

217
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,125
Masami!
Time to go.

218
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,000
Otonashi!
I'm counting on you!

219
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,250
Right!

220
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,750
Let's split up.

221
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,625
We'll deal
with the crazy pirate.

222
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,166
You guys
do what you have to do

223
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,625
to stop the Takumis' attack.

224
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,875
[explosions continue]

225
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,625
Alright, Nozomi.
You got this.

226
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,541
Hmm.

227
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,208
In defense of
honor and humanity.

228
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,541
Let's go, Daimon!

229
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,416
Here we go.

230
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,875
I get to become
a superhero, after all.

231
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,000
She's incredible!

232
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,916
[AI] Those two are friends now?
Didn't see that coming.

233
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,125
[alarms blaring]

234
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,166
In the end,
all I really cared about was...

235
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,916
[rumbling]

236
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,166
Kaguya?

237
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,541
I won't let you
throw your life away.

238
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,250
Even you
deserve another chance.

239
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,000
We'll take care of that ship.
You can leave it to us.

240
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,166
[yelling]

241
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,500
I'm glad those two showed up,
but who are they?

242
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,833
[grunting]

243
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,375
Grr!

244
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,791
[shouting]

245
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,375
[SHIMA] Things were
so crazy back there.

246
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,958
Who braved the gunfire
to bring the coat of arms?

247
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,416
Kuramochi's old bones
couldn't handle it.

248
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,958
Actually, it was Nozomi
and her friends who brought it.

249
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,541
Nozomi?

250
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,750
The girl who tried to stop me
from fighting you before

251
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,250
Oh. Impressive
for a shrimpy little girl.

252
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,041
Those girls remind me
of the Tanashi Tower.

253
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,791
[SHIMA]
What's that?

254
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,833
During the Great Tokyo War,

255
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,208
it was the robot
that secretly supported

256
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,416
the Tokyo Tower Robot's legs.

257
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:09,083
Anyway.
Will you tell Otomo something?

258
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,958
Tell him that there is
no need for pity.

259
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,916
[BOTH]
And up!

260
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,750
[groaning]

261
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,500
Jeez, that hurt.

262
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:42,875
[laughing]

263
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,333
[AI]
Are you okay, Nozomi?

264
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,583
Yeah, I'm fine.

265
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,000
I wonder what it
was like for her,

266
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,583
traveling around
with those girls.

267
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,916
I'm guessing that she
had a pretty good time.

268
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,541
Hey, President! No slacking off
'cause of your title.

269
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,708
It's not like we're doing this
for kicks, you know.

270
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,291
I'm taking a break, here.

271
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,041
Anyway, serves you right.
I mean, you destroyed the thing.

272
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,208
I told you I was
gonna use this ship, didn't I?

273
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,291
Being gentle wasn't an option.

274
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,750
The other guys fought us
pretty hard.

275
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:07,791
Stop that right now!

276
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,458
No more fighting, boys!
You hear me?

277
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,958
If you're curious, the man
directing them up there

278
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,500
is the one who formed Takumi Co.

279
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,041
Hold on.
What do you mean?

280
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,958
I'm afraid you'll have
to ask him directly

281
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,541
if you want more details.

282
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,000
Now there's something I have
to see to in Tokorozawa.

283
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,666
Please excuse me.

284
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,583
Momiyama...

285
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,000
Thanks a lot.

286
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,208
Sure.

287
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,291
--So, uh--
--No time.

288
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,375
Huh?

289
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,291
I'm sorry, I can't talk now.

290
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,958
If we cannot use
the space-time selector,

291
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,375
then we cannot
return to our own time.

292
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,750
With our current output,
and given the influence of...

293
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,041
Excuse me,

294
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,416
aren't you from
the Ishizukuri Stones?

295
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,375
...we can't
increase our altitude.

296
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,083
Additionally, we must install
hyper boosters on...

297
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,666
You're Otomo.
Aren't you?

298
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,666
...in order to be sure that we
can get out of the Moon Hall.

299
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,916
[HARUKA]
Professor?

300
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,958
Gah!

301
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,416
Why are you here?
I thought you escaped!

302
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,250
The pod came back.

303
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,541
An error occurred, and I wound
up in the distant past.

304
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,291
So, I put myself to sleep
to await tonight's full moon.

305
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,916
However, something went wrong.

306
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,250
I'm so glad I got
to see you again!

307
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,708
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

308
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,916
What? You mean you came
to the Propellers' HQ

309
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,250
to get your money back
for a bottle of water?

310
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,291
Yeah.

311
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,875
[YUKINA] It's not that
I minded buying it for her.

312
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,708
I just thought any extra money

313
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,166
is good to have
when you're traveling.

314
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,291
But it took you
three days to get there.

315
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,833
Your gas must've cost
more than that water.

316
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,333
[chuckles]

317
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,916
It did.
But that's the reason

318
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,833
I got to travel
with all of you guys.

319
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:19,375
I always used to feel so lost,
but now I don't anymore.

320
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,291
Look at Chi.

321
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,375
And she was so sure she wasn't
going to sleep tonight.

322
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,416
[AI]
She looks exhausted.

323
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,250
Chi-Chi's had a pretty
crazy life, hasn't she?

324
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,125
I can't believe she accidentally
stowed away on a spaceship!

325
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:38,291
Gotta say, it sounds like
something she'd do.

326
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,375
Someone that curious is bound
to get into some trouble.

327
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,541
[YUKINA]
This may sound strange,

328
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,541
but I actually met an alien
when I was a little kid.

329
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,791
[AI] Really?
That's crazy! I did, too!

330
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,333
[NOZOMI]
Yeah, same here.

331
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,958
It seemed so unreal, though.
I always thought it was a dream.

332
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,125
I know what you mean.
I felt like that, too.

333
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:59,666
Yeah, but it makes sense
now that we know they exist.

334
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,833
Oh, you're going home already?

335
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,833
Speaking of dreams,
I wonder what hers is about.

336
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,291
[AI]
Good question.

337
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,166
She's the one who's going home.

338
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,458
Goodbye, you guys.

339
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,375
Wait a minute,
Chi-Chi's camera!

340
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,583
--Huh?
--You know,

341
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,375
the one that can see dreams.

342
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,583
The final checks
have all been completed.

343
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,666
We're departing immediately.

344
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,583
Take care of yourself, Chi-Chi.

345
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,250
You too, U-tan.

346
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,458
Don't get lost
or anything, okay?

347
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,916
You either, Yukippe.
And thank you for the drawing!

348
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,666
I...

349
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,916
Nonsuke...

350
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,583
Thanks for everything.

351
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,416
You were my Maccha Green,
you know that, right?

352
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,333
You can't say that.

353
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,750
I didn't even fulfill your
request to gather the stones!

354
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,000
Maybe not,

355
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,833
but you made
my real wish come true.

356
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,000
Huh?

357
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,208
Thank you so much, Nonsuke,

358
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:16,250
and Yukippe, and U-tan.

359
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,541
I will never forget you.

360
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,708
Goodbye.

361
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,583
[MASAMI]
Nozomi! Nozomi!

362
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,958
Jeez, we were worried about you!
Auntie, I found Nonsuke.

363
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,333
[BOY] Hey, U-tan! How far did
you need to go to find the ball?

364
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,750
[GIRL]
You know the rules, Yukippe!

365
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,333
You can't wander off like that.

366
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,083
[laughing]

367
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,416
Goodbye.

368
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,916
[MOMIYAMA]
Pink stones shaped like hearts

369
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,791
have rained down
throughout history.

370
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,708
Those who draw the stones
to them may not realize

371
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,875
that it is their passion
that makes them fall.

372
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:10,500
In different times,
at different places,

373
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,416
on different planets,

374
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,458
people live their lives
as best they can.

375
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,791
Rolling along toward greatness.

376
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,708
And that goal,

377
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,958
the future that
shines so radiantly,

378
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,833
is called "tomorrow."
