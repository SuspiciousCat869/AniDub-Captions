Pardon me, Mamechiyo.

--Mmm?
--It appears that the captain

for saving me.

Guys, we didn't
actually do anything.

True, Shuten said
you could leave.

--It wasn't anything we did.
--Ah!

What she means to say is,

00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,375
it may not
have looked like much,

13
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,041
but we rescued you
from Shuten's gang

and basically saved
the festival, right?

Mm-hmm.

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,083
That means one stone
for us! Woo!

you have on it?

Please pretend
you didn't notice her.

you finish it up?

With the sketches
already done,

Well, we could always go
with a silhouette.

Maybe they just wanted you
to follow the sketch more.

That's what I was trying to do.

[MOMIYAMA] No. Unfortunately,
I couldn't find Chiaya.

But I did notice the Shuten gang
on Mount Oe acting suspiciously.

of the Lotus Queen, huh?

you'd want me to look into it.

what they would be doing.

If I play my cards right,

I may be able to bring
them all back with me.
