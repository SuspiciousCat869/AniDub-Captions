It actually worked.

This is amazing.
Congratulations!

The Moon Hall
really does exist.

It's just too bad it took

6
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,250
an incredibly rare phenomenon
to prove it.

7
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,333
Mm-hmm.

00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,333
It's a beautiful planet,
isn't it?

The Moon Hall's closing!

[OTOMO]
It'll be all right.

11
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:54,208
We can simply use
the space-time selector.

12
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,541
Then we can return
the way we came.

00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,958
The engine is malfunctioning!

00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,000
Damn!
We're going to crash!

-No, you should take it!
-There's no time, please!

It has truly been an honor.
I'll never forget you.

Don't rush your strikes, Momo.

more open.

You should be thanking us.

We could have handed you over
to the local vigilante squad.

You're right, thanks.

48

I couldn't help myself.
Those peaches were so tasty.

00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,833
Well, obviously they are.

50
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,958
My mom was the one
who grew them.

Mom, huh?

52
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,750
So that's why
you're so defensive.

53
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,083
Oh!

[Haru] So, what were you doing
wandering around the orchard?

00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,875
[AI] Uh, well, I'm kinda on
a training journey.

A drifter Best?
No way.

00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,541
Based on the moves
I saw yesterday,

you're one hundred percent
a Rest.

63
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,666
That's just 'cause
I don't have the proper gear.

64
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,500
I still need a stone.

65
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,375
Can't be a Best

Here, help yourselves, girls.

Oh!
Thank you so much.

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,875
Well, we gotta help
each other in lean times.

And we owe
young Haru here a great deal.

00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,375
This doesn't mean you've been
forgiven for stealing, mind you.

75
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,625
But you'll make up for that
with manual labor.

The tax collector for

[HARU]
Here in Okayama,

101
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,166
the state vigilante
squad captain

102
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,875
manages everyone's taxes.

103

The tax rate is far
greater than any other nation.

The captain is Ura Kukino.

take her, couldn't you?

00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,000
[MASAMI]
Right.

109
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,875
If you could just
explain that one more time.

110
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,875
[HARUKA]
I've explained it five times.

111

Yeah, I know, but...

112
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,458
The time will be upon us soon.

It's drawing nearer
by the moment.

Two far-away moons connect once
every 415 years.

00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,666
The event is called
the Extreme Double Super Moon.

That's my only chance.

117
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,708
On that night, I must bring her
back to her home planet.

118
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:34,875
That poor young girl
I got involved in this mess.

119
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,166
And just so we're clear,

120
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,750
you're saying that you are,
in fact, an alien?

121
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,916
That's a fascinating story,
but I don't much care

122
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,666
what planet you're from,
to be honest.

What matters is the girl.

Is it true that
Otonashi was taken?

125

[HARUKA]
It appears so.

"If you value the life

ever since I got the ship from
the display at Aviation Park,

since I became president.

137
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,041
[MASAMI] Wait.
You mean that was a UFO?

138
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,791
We're dealing with the gang
without honor and humanity

139
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,208
that controls Hiroshima.

140
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,708
I wouldn't expect
honest negotiations.

141
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,958
Here's what I want from you--

142
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,458
retrieve the Cores
and the octopus pots.

143
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,500
And bring back the girl,
as well.

144
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,250
Octopus pot.

145

Yeah, how exactly does
that work without our stones?

[HARUKA]
Do you want a protective charm?

147
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,916
That's understandable.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,458
You're uneasy after
your long convalescence.

Whoa, momma.
What's that?

[HARUKA]
Are you serious?

How did I not realize this?

153
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,291
Yeah, weren't you
the assistant of the person

154

who orchestrated
this whole thing?

Well, I was still
a student then,

and not a very good assistant,
for that matter.

There has been
a change of plans.

She's nowhere nearby.

--[barks]
--Down, boy. Back.

319
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,708
Mom, I need
to tell you something.

320
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,708
The dog first.
Get rid of the dog!

321
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,166
I was lying about
going to school.

322
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,708
I, uh--

323
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:18,125
I joined a vigilante squad,
the Mimasaka Peaches.

324
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,583
I can't yell at you now.

325
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,416
Not while you're holding
that demon spawn.

326
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,875
So I take it that's why
I've been getting visits

327
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,416
from everybody?

328
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,750
You shouldn't be getting
yourself involved in this, Momo.

329
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,750
But I have
to do something, Mom.

330
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,916
You're working yourself
too hard these days.

331
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,583
You're taking years
off your life.

332
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,000
[HARU]
I'm not as weak as you think.

333
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,333
Don't worry about me.

334
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,833
I do worry, though.

335
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:44,000
I can't help it.
You're the only mom I have.

336
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,500
This place, there's
no other country like it.

337
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,041
It's so normal.

338
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,750
Everyone just wants
to live their own quiet lives.

339
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,250
[HARU]
Sorry, dear.

340
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,833
I will not allow you
to fight that woman,

341
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,125
and that's all there is to it.

342
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,500
I hate you!

343
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,166
[AI] You don't need to go
and bring her back?

344
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,333
It's fine, she'll probably
just spend the night

345
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,750
at the squad headquarters.

346
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,958
She won't listen right now,
no matter what I say.

347
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,166
I still don't get why you're
refusing to fight for Momo

348
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,333
and everybody else.

349
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,458
I mean,
you're a Best, aren't you?

350
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,166
If you won't, I'd be happy
to use that stone.

351
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,333
--What?
--Hi, U-tan.

352
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,041
Chi-Chi, how?
What--?

353
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,250
How did--? I don't--?
When did you get here?

354
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,291
[CHIAYA]
Um, well.

355
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,958
It just sort of happened,
you know?

356
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,208
--Huh?
--You know this weird girl, Ai?

357
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,791
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

358
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,458
She's a friend of mine,
actually.

359
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,208
Hi, I'm Chiaya Misono.

360
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,375
Thank you for looking after
U-tan for us.

361
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,541
"U-tan"?

362
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,833
That's my childhood nickname.

363
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,583
[HARU]
The octopus is gone!

364
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,208
The ostrich must've taken it.
Or the dog. [whimpers]

365
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,333
[AI] It doesn't matter
how hard you try.

366
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,083
As a Rest, you'll never
accomplish anything.

367
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,875
[NOZOMI] I'm starting
to think she was right.

368
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,833
How could I
ever take Masa's place?

369
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,916
If I were a Best,
could I have helped

370
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,708
instead of just standing by?

371
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,583
I've almost forgotten what
Mom's dango tastes like.

372
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,333
I miss her.
And Dad, too.

373
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,166
So, are you still mad?
At Nonsuke, I mean.

374
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,250
--Huh?
--You aren't, I can tell.

375
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,666
Nozomi was the one
who was mad, not me.

376
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,833
Nonsuke's not mad anymore,
either.

377
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:51,458
She was sad after you left.
I think she really did miss you.

378
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,208
Friends fight.

379
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,833
What matters is
that you make up.

380
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,750
[pounding on door]

381
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,375
[MAN]
Haru!

382
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:02,958
Thank goodness.

383
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,791
Momo went by herself
to the demon's castle.

384
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,708
That doesn't sound
like a good thing.

385
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,125
[MAN] The stronghold
of the Okayama Demons.

386
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,166
The Demons' leader,
Ura Kukino, lives there

387
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,583
with the other squad members.

388
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,333
It's a dangerous place.

389
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,666
[sighs]

390
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,166
I'm Momo.

391
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,583
I'm the representative
of the Mimasaka Peaches.

392
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:59,291
Per the Twin Tower Declaration,
I ask to duel your captain.

393
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:03,291
Ura Kukino, will you honor
the spirit of the declaration?

394
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,541
[barks]

395
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,208
[MOMO]
If I win, I ask only

396
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,083
that you lower the taxes.

397
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,666
Everyone suffers
because of them.

398
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,375
Come out here!
Come and face me!

399
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,125
[DOG barking]

400
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,083
[yawns]

401
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:30,000
Staying up late is bad
for one's complexion, my dear.

402
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,416
Don't think you're immune
because you're young.

403
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,291
You'll regret
that kind of attitude

404
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,125
when you're in your 30s.

405
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:39,458
That's not really what you
expect a demon to look like.

406
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:45,166
Fight me, demon woman.

407
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,375
[URA laughs]

408
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,416
Sure.
Anytime, anywhere.

409
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,375
I'm ready.

410
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:01,291
[KIBINO] Excuse me, do you
think you could help me?

411
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,083
I'm looking for a shop
called Nayotake Bamboo.

412
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,458
Is it nearby?

413
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:07,333
Um, sorry but we're
not from around here.

414
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:10,208
Yeah, sorry.
Let's go. Walk faster.

415
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,375
Excuse me!
I know where it is.
