00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,583
[BLACK LIZARD]
So tell me,

5
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:27,458
what did you think of
my birthday present?

6
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,250
Huh?

7
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,791
You should be ashamed.

8
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,583
You disgust me.

9
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,958
I wish you'd just die.

[AKECHI]
Who cares about your birthday?

12
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,166
You really thought I'd remember?

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,625
I don't waste my brain cells

14
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,958
storing useless
information like that.

15
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:43,625
[BLACK LIZARD]
So...

16
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,000
Wait, Akechi.

17
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:47,875
Are you saying that you
don't care about me at all?

18
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,958
You sick bitch.

19
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,291
Even if you were running around

20
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,833
with sticks of dynamite
in your mouth,

21
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,791
I really wouldn't give a damn.

24
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,500
I wanna ask you a question.

00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:02,583
Oh, please do.

26
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,416
I'm up for anything. I'm yours.

Order me to do
anything you want!

28
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,250
Let me help you with whoever
it is that you're dealing with.

29
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,833
Just like it was in
the good old days.

30
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,708
We dealt with all
sorts of criminals.

31
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:18,250
The Bronze Demon,
Electric Man M, Metal Man.

33
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,833
[AKECHI] You know about
Panorama Island, right?

34
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,833
[HANABISHI]
Morning, class!

35
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,416
I hope you're all well-rested!

36
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,541
You'll need your brain-power
because exams start today!

37
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,958
Now, some of you may be worried
that you'll fail miserably

38
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,500
and carry that shame forever,
but you'll be just fine!

39
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,875
I know you can do this!

40
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,833
And don't waste time
worrying about me!

41
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,666
I have my entire
career ahead of me!

42
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,708
[gasps]

43
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,291
I had extensive
therapy last month,

44
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,125
so I'm confident
about moving forward!

45
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,250
Though to be honest it
might set my progress back

46
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,250
if none of you say you missed me
or give me a comforting snuggle!

47
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,125
[HASHIBA]
You have got to be kidding me.

48
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,791
Don't forget that I'm also
on every social media site,

49
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,083
so feel free to friend me and
like all of my posts, okay?

50
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,250
[sighs] Right.

51
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,833
[KOBAYASHI] Why do we have
to take these exams anyway?

52
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,916
The whole point's just
to see how we're doing.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,625
Check our progress.
Is that right?

54
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,875
Yeah. I guess that's why.

55
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,125
Well...

56
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,041
I already know I'm
not learning in class.

57
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,875
So there's no reason
to take them.

58
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,541
[HASHIBA]
It doesn't really work that way.

59
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,875
Why are you so unhappy
when we're at school?

60
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,333
[KOBAYASHI] It just feels
like a waste of the whole day.

61
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,708
[HASHIBA] That's not a
good attitude to have.

62
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,083
If you focused at school
like you do on cases,

63
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,500
you'd pass easy.

64
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,333
All you have to do is try.

65
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,000
[sighs]

66
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,541
[KOBAYASHI] There were
ten different Twenty Faces

67
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,750
just last month.

68
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,500
This month there have
already been three,

69
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,125
each one using a
different method

70
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,208
to kill people they
feel deserve it.

71
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,333
Now the first one beat his
victim with a steel pipe.

72
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,958
Case closed!

73
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:25,708
[KOBAYASHI] The second one put
poison in his victim's food.

74
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,291
Case closed!

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,333
[KOBAYASHI]
And the third one...

76
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,500
stabbed the victim with a knife.

77
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,375
[KOBAYASHI] Every time a new
Twenty Faces has appeared,

78
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,125
Akechi stepped in
to solve the crime

79
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,833
before he was even asked to.

80
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,041
This is the first time

81
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,333
I've seen him so
invested in his work.

82
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,708

Are you even listening?

83
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,000
Kobayashi?

84
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,000
[KOBAYASHI]
Mm?

85
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:49,875
What'd you say?

86
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,833
Huh? You didn't hear me at all?

87
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,666
I said that you would
do better in school

88
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,250
if you put more effort
into studying.

Flunking the exams...

90
00:04:56,583 --> 00:05:00,416
[KOBAYASHI] Akechi, what
are you hiding from us?

91
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,500
[AKECHI] I thought this was
the week of your exams.

92
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,625
It is the week of our exams!

93
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,500
We've got two more days.

94
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,916
I see.

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,125
[KOBAYASHI] Uh! I have an
idea! I'll be right back!

96
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,708
These exams are
extremely important.

00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,041
Can you get him to take
them seriously, please?

98
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,791
[AKECHI] Has anything
I've ever said to him

99
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,416
made much of a difference?

Okay, now we can get started!

But... Kobayashi.

103
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,166
Why did you go put
on that dress again?

104
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,541

Don't I look good in this?

Yeah.

Wait a sec, it's not a matter
of if you look good or not!

Uh. Help.

Let's see...

The fourth one hasn't
happened, right?

111

No, not yet.

00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,541
Yep, that's right.

116

Can't it rest for a day?

117
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,875
Will you let me know

as soon as you hear
about the next murder?

119

[AKECHI] I might consider it if
you take your exams this week.

120
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,250
[KOBAYASHI]
I've got it!

121
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,916
Let's settle it
by playing a game!

So you're gonna completely
ignore the offer he just made?

No, I'm simply proposing
a counter-offer.

Poker! I lose, I take the exams!

Ah. Wait, you promise?

Yeah!

132

[HASHIBA]
So, uh... This is bad.

[shivers] Apparently I'm
really lousy at this game.

using as chips.

Plus, I'm almost naked!

in with a check.

No thanks! I'm out!

[AKECHI]
So, what's the deal?

141
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,083
You're heir to the
Hashiba Foundation.

How is it that you're
so terrible at gambling?

143
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,083
Running a company and
gambling are different.

144
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,083
I'm not so sure...

145
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,416
What?! They are!

146
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,666
No one in my family
is particularly good

147
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,416
at this kind of game.
Despite that,

148
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,875
they've still managed to
run a successful business.

149
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,416
If that's the case, we can
increase the bet times ten!

150
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,000
[HASHIBA]
What?! Why would we do that?

151
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,083
[KOBAYASHI] If you win this
round, you'll be ahead of me!

152
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,750
[AKECHI]
If you lose it's gonna suck.

153
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,750
[KOBAYASHI]
Uh.

154
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,166
Right.

155
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,541
It's not that I don't understand
the game or anything,

156
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,125
I'm just no good at betting.

157
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,625
Feels like the universe starts
working against me or something.

158
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:12,583
No big deal.

159
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,750
I said you could bet checks.

160
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,333
Listen you!

161
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:14,875
I.

162
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:15,500
Don't.

163
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,250
Wanna bet checks.

164
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,208
Or clothes!

165
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,416
[KOBAYASHI]
It's okay!

166
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,125
You don't have to play.

167
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,416
Uh... It's fine.
I don't mind that much.

168
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,583
It's just that. Well...

169
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:26,916
Akechi, you're amazing.

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,791
How did you get
so good at poker?

171
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,416
[KOBAYASHI] You must be some
kind of card game whiz.

172
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,041
You're not so bad yourself.

173
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,541
[KOBAYASHI]
Thank you!

174
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,416
Hashiba and I have played card
games like this for years.

175
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,291
I always win.

176
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,208
[HASHIBA]
Yeah.

177
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,541
Even in elementary school

178
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,041
you always seemed to
have a knack for it.

179
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,916
You can share the chocolates
between the two of you.

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,208
[HASHIBA]
Wha...?! Uh, thanks.

181
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,250
[KOBAYASHI] What kind of
things did you like to do

182
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,750
when you were a kid, Akechi?

183
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,708
Did you play a lot
of games, too?

184
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,291
[piano plays]

185
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,125
[AKECHI]
This headache is killing me.

186
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,333
I'm gonna sleep.

187
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,833
Go ahead and let yourselves out.

188
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,041
[HASHIBA]
That was abrupt.

189
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,083
Was it something we said?

190
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,291
Yeah.

191
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,791
Akechi doesn't like
to talk about his past.

192
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,541
I wonder why.

193
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,500
[gasps]

194
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,250
Get outta my head.

195
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,291
Get the hell out.

196
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,291
[NAKAMURA] The fourth one
has finally happened.

197
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,708
[AKECHI gasps]

198
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,333
[NAKAMURA] Sorry, I didn't want
to disturb you by knocking.

199
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,666
[AKECHI]
Sure.

200
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,333
I just stopped by
to let you know

201
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,541
that our friend Twenty Faces

202
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,541
has appeared for the
fourth time this month.

203
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,875
This one went out of their way

204
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,833
to send us our very own
letter of challenge.

205
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,291
[AKECHI]
A letter?

206
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,958
Been a while since
we've dealt with a perp

207
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,333
who leaves love notes, huh?

208
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,500
It says something
along the lines of:

209
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,000
"Will the detectives at the
Shinjuku main office be able

210
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,458
to solve the impossible
crime I've committed?"

211
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,083
I gotta say, they don't
lack in confidence.

212
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,375
[AKECHI]
Neither do I.

213
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,625
[NAKAMURA] Yeah, I thought
you might say that.

214
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,708
But listen, maybe you
should pass on this one.

215
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,041
I've got a bad feeling.

216
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,708
And you've been spreading
yourself awfully thin.

217
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,875
[AKECHI grunts]

218
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,000
[NAKAMURA]
I'm sure neither of us

219
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,458
has been getting
much sleep lately.

220
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:07,125
I mean, ever since...
Well, you know.

221
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,333
The incident with Kagami.

222
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,291
We had ten new cases
within a month.

223
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,166
This'll be the fourth
one this month.

224
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,041
For every Twenty
Faces we arrest,

225
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,250
seems two more pop
up in their place.

226
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,875
Where does it all end?

227
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,625
How is Kagami? Is he well?

228
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,500
[NAKAMURA sighs]
Yeah.

229
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,875
I keep wondering if
there was some way

230
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,625
I could've helped him
before he got that bad.

231
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,166
We really should focus
on the task at hand.

232
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,333
Uh?

233
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,000
Wait. Don't you usually
have a full house?

234
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,416
I thought those junior high kids
hung out here after school.

235
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,375
[AKECHI] They're taking
their exams this week.

236
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,875
What?!

237
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,750
So that's it.

238
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,500
I knew there was a reason
I had a bad feeling.

239
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,666
Really, let's let someone
else handle this one.

240
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,125
I don't think I'm up to taking
a trip alone with you.

241
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,708
What trip?

242
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,166
Just a few hours after
we got that letter

243
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,083
another report came in.
From the sounds of it,

244
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,875
seems our perp may
have already committed

245
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,625
their "impossible crime."

246
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,666
The thing is,
it's pretty far away.

247
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,791
[AKECHI]
Should've said that first.

248
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,250
So where is it?

249
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,250
[NAKAMURA]
Near Ise Bay, I think.

250
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,666
Let's see... What was it?

251
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,166
Well, point is, it's an island.

252
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,666
Island?

253
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,666
[NAKAMURA] There's not much
information about the place.

254
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,375
What was that name again?

255
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,916
Ah, it's on the
tip of my tongue.

256
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,083
Panorama Island.

257
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,708
It's home to an adult theme
park that the chairman

258
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,875
of the Komoda Corporation
dreamt up with an artist friend.

259
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,416
It's their little
Heaven on Earth.

260
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Komoda Corp. is
lower than scum.

261
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,791
They exploit their employees,

262
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,250
and bind them with
one-sided contracts.

263
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,291
[AKECHI]
It sounds like a sweatshop.

264
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,041
[BLACK LIZARD]
They put up a charitable front

265
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,666
for the public's satisfaction,

266
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,083
but that's just a cover-up
for some shady dealings

267
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,875
they have under the table with
the ruling political party.

268
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,833
And that's not all
they're doing.

269
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,375
Twenty hours of hard
labor a day is mandatory

270
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,166
with corporal punishment
as incentive.

271
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,083
Their employees are deprived,

272
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:59,291
both of their personal time
and personal privacy.

273
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,583
There are countless deaths
by suicide and exhaustion.

274
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,000
Basically modern-day slavery.

275
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,500
[BLACK LIZARD] Employees are
forced to worship the chairman

276
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,916
as if he's some sort of god.
They're all being brainwashed.

277
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,291
Plenty of illegal and
inhumane things happen,

278
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:16,500
so it would be quite the scandal
if the public found out.

279
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,041
[AKECHI]
But they cover it up.

280
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,291
[BLACK LIZARD]
Yes, that's right.

281
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,541
There are a few articles
on conspiracy websites

282
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,250
and in the occasional
trashy tabloid.

283
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,125
It's no understatement
that corporate leaders

284
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,416
are the sludge of the Earth.

285
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,291
They would be prime targets
for Twenty Faces.

286
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,750
[NAKAMURA]
Honestly, that ride wasn't bad.

287
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,958
[NAKAMURA] I wonder if
the Prefectural Police

288
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,833
have followed orders and
not touched anything.

289
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,208
It's not too hot here,

290
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,583
so maybe the bodies haven't
started decomposing yet.

291
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,958
I hope.

292
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,833
[AKECHI exhales]

293
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,166
[NAKAMURA]
Huh? Something the matter?

294
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,083
No vending machines.

295
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,583
Oh. Your coffee.

296
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,500
[MIYAMA]
Thank you for coming!

297
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,958
You must be from the
Shinjuku main office.

298
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,791
Must be the local police.

299
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,041
[MIYAMA]
Glad you arrived safely.

300
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,375
I'm Officer Miyama.

301
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,666
[TSUNODA] I'm Tsunoda
from Komoda Construction.

302
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,833
I'm the on-site supervisor for
all building on Panorama Island.

303
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,916
Komoda Construction.

304
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,250
That's one of the branches of
the Komoda Corporation, right?

305
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,500
[TSUNODA]
Yeah. It sure is.

306
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,958
Show us to the crime scene.

307
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,125
[MIYAMA]
The Prefectural Police

308
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,125
are actually inspecting
it at the moment.

309
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,625
Great.

310
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,625
Didn't you say you ordered
them to keep their hands off?

311
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,833
Well obviously they
didn't listen to me.

312
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:31,833
[sighs]

313
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:32,833
[MIYAMA]
They were pretty insistent

314
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,250
on starting their
inspection early

315
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,666
so they wouldn't lose
forensic evidence.

316
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,250
[AKECHI] You need to
stop them immediately.

317
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,750
[NAKAMURA] Hey. This guy's with
the Imperial Household Agency.

318
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,083
[MIYAMA]
Is that true?

319
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,416
I thought you seemed
a little young

320
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,833
for a detective but
you're the real deal!

321
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,958
[TSUNODA] Oh, so you're
some big shot, huh?

322
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,166
Well you have your
work cut out for you!

323
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,833
Look around! The construction
here on Panorama Island

324
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,000
makes it the biggest
project in this prefecture,

325
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,166
no, this country!

326
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,125
Actually, the entire world!

327
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,333
Impressive.

328
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,708
And?

329
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,250
[TSUNODA] This place is
going to be incredible when

330
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,375
it's finished! We owe it
all to our great leaders.

331
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,666
Those big dreamers who
made all of this possible.

332
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,000
And who are they?

333
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,791
[TSUNODA] Chairman Komoda
himself and Mr. Hitomi,

334
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,708
the brilliant art producer.

335
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,125
[KOMODA] Panorama Island!
Come one, come all!

336
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,500
This man-made paradise
will entice your senses

337
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,708
and thrill your mind!

338
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,375
Your dreams will come true,

339
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:32,125
and all of your fantasies
will be realized!

340
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:36,000
This theme park perfectly fuses
manmade and natural art!

341
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,791
Love for nature!

342
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,750
[KOMODA]
And love for the arts!

343
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,541
[HITOMI] It's the embodiment
of our love for...

344
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,375
[HITOMI, KOMOD]
All things beautiful!

345
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,000
[KOMODA] People flock to
Greece for the Parthenon.

346
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,000
[HITOMI] Tourists are drawn
to the Great Wall of China!

347
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,250
[KOMODA, HITOMI] But Japan
will have Panorama Island!

348
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,500
[AKECHI sighs] Well, that
was... a little extreme.

349
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,041
Ambitious project.

350
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,500
[KOBAYASHI] I wonder if
they're trying to create

351
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,833
a historic landmark?

352
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,916
When people with a lot of
money attempt do design

353
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,375
places of interest, I
think they usually fail.

354
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,666
[KOBAYASHI]
Uh?

355
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,000
Can you two keep your
comments to yourselves?

356
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,500
[KOMODA] This is a project
that everyone involved

357
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,125
will be proud to be a part of!

358
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,666
With visual splendor
centered around love,

359
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,750
we will achieve absolute
nirvana in the 21st century!

360
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,291
I will see this
venture completed,

361
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,833
even if it bankrupts me!

362
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,500
Everything I've done
in my life has led

363
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,625
to cultivating this enterprise!

364
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,125
Yes!

365
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,416
We'll harness the manpower
to drag Heaven down from above

366
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,833
and root it into the Earth!

367
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:38,125
Then everyone will come to
realize the inherent value

368
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:42,375
and virtue of all the heavenly
beauty that we hold so dear.

369
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,125
[KOMODA, HITOMI]
Thank you.

370
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,875
[BLACK LIZARD] Well? Told ya
they were outta their gourds.

371
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,750
You're one to talk. Get lost.

372
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,500
[BLACK LIZARD moans]

373
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,333
[TSUNODA] The world had never
seen such ingenious visionaries

374
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,666
linked by their
boundless imaginations!

375
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,916
[AKECHI]
Mm.

376
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,875
The hell...?

377
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,416
Why so many?

378
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,291
[NAKAMURA]
Uh...

379
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,375
[AKECHI] I'm assuming it's
supposed to be artistic?

380
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,458
An avant-garde aesthetic using
high-quality mannequins?

381
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,083
[TSUNODA]
You hit the nail on the head!

382
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,791
They wanted to admire the
beauty of the female form.

383
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,083
Sparing no expense,

384
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,291
each of these pieces cost
several million yen.

385
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,916
Ah... Gotta say,
they had good taste.

386
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,958
[TSUNODA]
But we never expected this.

387
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,083
[AKECHI]
Killed by their own creation.

388
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,000
What?

389
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,791
[AKECHI]
There are two victims.

390
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,875
One is Genzaburo Komoda,

391
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,083
chairman of the
Komoda Corporation.

392
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,625
He actually owned the Island

393
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,583
and took responsibility
for daily operations.

394
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,583
[NAKAMURA] So let me guess,
the other is his partner.

395
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,750
[AKECHI] Right. Hirosuke
Hitomi, art producer.

396
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:57,916
Co-creators and designers of
the Panorama Island project.

397
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,333
When were they found?

398
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,125
[NAKAMURA]
This morning, around 4am.

399
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,500
I guess we'll sit tight

400
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,041
until the scene can be
investigated in more detail.

401
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,625
I'm Medical Examiner Minami!

402
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,000
And I'm Corpsey!

403
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,541
[BOTH] Time for another
Three-Minute Shocking!

404
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,666
Today we're dealing with deaths

405
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,208
caused by crushing
or suffocation.

406
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,875
I dub it a mannequin massacre!

407
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,541
Does that mean we have more
than one cadaver to inspect?

408
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,291
You betcha!

409
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:18,958
Two!

410
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,291
This guy is a goner!

411
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:20,875
This one...

412
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,041
Expired!

413
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,666
What the...? [screams]

414
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,708
It was all over in no time flat.

415
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,208
That's it for today!

416
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:31,375
This concludes Three-Minute
Shocking. See ya next time.

417
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,916
[AKECHI] Well, now.
This seems familiar to me.

418
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,625
Suffocated by beauty,
like Elagabalus's guests.

419
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,250
[NAKAMURA]
What's that mean?

420
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,166
A Roman Emperor
who killed people

421
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,875
by drowning them in roses.

422
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:47,000
[MIYAMA] Whoa, he knows his
stuff! That's impressive.

423
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,958
Is there another way
to get into this room?

424
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,458
[TSUNODA] There's only one
entrance and it was locked.

425
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,041
I opened it, but I wasn't alone.

426
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,916
These two were with me.

427
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,833
[AKECHI] A locked exhibition
hall with no other entrance.

428
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,833
The hoarded mass of mannequins
suddenly collapses,

429
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,666
pinning the men in charge.

430
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,458
Seems like an unfortunate
accident to me.

431
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,000
No, it was murder.

432
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,666
Yeah? I guess our letter
of challenge gave it away?

433
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,916
That's not it.

434
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,041
You have a suspect?
I'm not surprised.

435
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,666
If we have this
figured out already,

436
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,083
let's go ahead and
wrap things up.

437
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,166
[AKECHI]
We need to investigate.

438
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,208
[NAKAMURA]
Huh?

439
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,750
If you're doin'
things by the book,

440
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,250
the Twenty Faces crimes must
really freak you out, Detective.

441
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,500
[AKECHI grunts]
Shut up.

442
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:32,083
It was just a little joke.
Meant nothing personal.

443
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,791
[AKECHI]
Ya got vending machines?

444
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:37,500
[HIGASHIKOJI] I'm sorry, sir.
They haven't been installed yet.

445
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,291
[NAKAMURA]
Aww, no canned coffee.

446
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,250
Can't believe this...

447
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,958
[AKECHI] The mannequin display
toppled without warning.

448
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,208
[KITAMI] There was a loud
crashing sound that came

449
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,791
from inside the exhibition hall.

450
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,583
The three of us went to
check it out together.

451
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,291
[HIGASHIKOJI]
It was awful.

452
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,708
We could barely keep it together

453
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,750
seeing our bosses
lying there like that.

454
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,875
I'll never forget what I saw.

455
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,291
[MIYAMA] They were
discovered before dawn.

456
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,583
It was around 4am. I find
that a little bit strange.

457
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,166
[TSUNODA]
You shouldn't!

458
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,083
We're always up and busting our
humps that early around here!

459
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,250
[laughs]

460
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,958
We're all willing to
work day and night

461
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,541
whatever the circumstances!

462
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,916
I'd say Komoda has the best

463
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,416
employee loyalty
record of them all!

464
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,375
[BLACK LIZARD]
Modern enslavement methods.

465
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,916
Hard labor rewarded
with corporal punishment.

466
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,333
There have been a countless
number of employees who

467
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,000
either died from too much
work or committed suicide.

468
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:46,166
I even heard rumors of
drug-induced brainwashing.

469
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,625
So? Have you
figured it out yet?

470
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,916
Would you shut up
already? Get lost.

471
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,750
[BLACK LIZARD moans]
What ecstasy!

472
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,416
This is a locked-room
murder mystery!

473
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,541
Isn't that great?

474
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,666
What?!

475
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,416
You're enjoying this
a little too much!

476
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,958
No way! Just look
at that mannequin!

477
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,208
It's so well made.

478
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,041
It's like the real person!

479
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,333
[HASHIBA] What do you mean
by 'the real person'?

480
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,833
[KOBAYASHI] I mean it looks
like the real person!

481
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:13,875
Yeah...

482
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,416
I heard you but
what does that mean?

483
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,041
[KOBAYASHI] The 'real' in "real
person" means it looks real!

484
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,833
[AKECHI]
Everybody's hassling me.

485
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,041
[NAKAMURA] We should just file
this as an unfortunate accident,

486
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,125
--you know?
--[phone rings]

487
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,666
[NAKAMURA]
Huh? Hello, Nakamura here.

488
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,416
Huh?

489
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:29,958
What?

490
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,166
A helicopter?

491
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,541
To Panorama Island?

492
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,416
Right now?

493
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,916
[KOBAYASHI]
We made it here, Akechi!

494
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,708
[HASHIBA] Hey! You need
to keep the door closed!

495
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,416
Now I understand why you said
you wanted to come here.

496
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,291
Whenever we land we...

497
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,416
[KOBAYASHI]
Akechi, look!

498
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,375
I even thought to
bring a swimsuit!

499
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,166
Wait?! You plan on
going swimming?!

500
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,208
[KOBAYASHI] Do you think there's
a way we'll have any extra time

501
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,625
to go swimming?

502
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,000
You better have thought
to bring me some coffee.

503
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,458
[KOBAYASHI]
We can't hear up here!

504
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,375
[HASHIBA] Kobayashi, it's
dangerous to lean forward

505
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,583
like that! Are you trying...

506
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,916
[KOBAYASHI]
I brought some coffee for you!

507
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:07,000
Is it really a locked-room
murder mystery case?

508
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,083
I really think you're
enjoying this way too much.

509
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,416
[KOBAYASHI]
Catch it!

510
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,375
This is a locked-room
murder mystery!

511
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,458
Isn't that great?

512
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,583
What?!

513
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,166
You're enjoying this
a little too much.

514
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,916
[AKECHI]
Heh. Now I can work.

515
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,666
The game begins.

516
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,458
[AKECHI]
This month's fourth Twenty Faces

517
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,750
has finally appeared.
