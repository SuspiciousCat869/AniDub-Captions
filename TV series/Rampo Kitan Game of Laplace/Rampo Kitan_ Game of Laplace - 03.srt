00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,875
[SACHIKO]
Are you okay?

2
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:29,666
[SACHIKO]
You're gonna freeze

3
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,875
if you fall asleep
in a place like this.

4
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,125
[SHADOW-MAN]
I haven't eaten for days.

5
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,833
It's hard to move.

6
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,083
[SHADOW-MAN]
You should head home.

7
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,333
I wouldn't want you
to catch a cold.

8
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,958
[SACHIKO]
Mister, here.

9
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,375
[SHADOW-MAN]
Huh?

10
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,875
[gasps, cries]

11
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,708
Thank you.

12
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,958
[KOBAYASHI]
Nine girls have gone missing

13
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,750
in the past two months alone.

14
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,083
[AKECHI]
More missing persons, huh?

15
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,666
Maybe they're being turned
into desks this time.

16
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,708
That's inappropriate.

17
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,208
Ahem!

18
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,333
We have reason to believe that

19
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,000
these disappearances
are all connected,

20
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,041
and the Shadow-Man
is our suspect.

21
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,291
"Shadow-Man"?
Never heard of him.

22
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,541
[AKECHI]
He likes to call himself

23
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,375
a gentleman thief,
and a master of disguise.

24
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,166
[AKECHI]
But if you ask me,

25
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,500
he's just a Robin Hood wannabe
with really weird fashion sense.

26
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,500
He's got a fascination
with little girls,

27
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,416
but as of yet he's
never been suspected

28
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,875
of actually harming any.

29
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,833
[KAGAMI] It was reported
that a suspicious man

30
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,166
wearing a paper bag on his head

31
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,916
was seen lurking
around a victim's home

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,916
prior to her disappearance.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why a paper bag?

34
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,416
[AKECHI]
Who knows?

35
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,083
He wears it whenever he does
his work as Shadow-Man,

36
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,250
as if all the creepy
lurking wasn't enough.

37
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,750
[KOBAYASHI] I wonder if the
bag symbolizes something.

38
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,083
Doubt it.

39
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,083
Some crooks just
want a calling card.

40
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,666
Case of the Shadow-Man.

41
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,375
Known gentleman thief,
and lover of little girls.

42
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,250
Akechi, we have to solve it!
When can we get started?

43
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,708
I don't involve myself in
things that don't interest me.

44
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,208
[KOBAYASHI]
Why not?

45
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,791
[KAGAMI] Akechi, I understand
that you get bored easily,

46
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,625
but do you think maybe
you could take the victims

47
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,500
into account from time to time?

48
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,958
[KOBAYASHI]
Then I'll investigate!

49
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:50,958
Forget it.

50
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,166
No. Not a chance.

51
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,416
--[phone rings]
--[KOBAYASHI] If you're not

52

53
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,000
--Is that okay?
--[KAGAMI] Excuse me.

54
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,166

--[KAGAMI] Hello?

55
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,916

Are you serious? All right!

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,833
[HASHIBA]
Kobayashi!

57
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,083
[KAGAMI]
Yeah, that sounds fine.

58
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,333
Either one you want.

59
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,166
[KOBAYASHI, HASHIBA chattering]

60
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,416
[KAGAMI]
I'll be home later. Goodbye.

61
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,916
[sighs]

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,291
Was that the police?

63
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,333
No, that was my little sister.

64
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,750
She wanted to discuss
our dinner plans.

65
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,416
I keep telling her not
to call me at work,

66
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,583
but there's no stopping her.

67
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,708
Sister complex.

68
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,083
What? I said stop saying that.

69
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,625
Ahem! Moving on.

70
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,458
Don't involve yourself
in this case.

71
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,666
You're new to this and
might get into trouble.

72
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,791
Just forget my request
for cooperation, all right?

73
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,666
See ya.

74
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,166
[KOBAYASHI]
Okay! We can start with

75
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,708
conducting some interviews.

76
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,000
Hey, weren't you listening?

77
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,458
He said no!

78
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,208
Even if we had permission,
we don't know how to begin.

79
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,583
Sure we do!

80
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,208
I took some pictures of the
case file with my phone.

81
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,875
We can start by calling
the victims' relatives.

82
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,666
Have you lost your mind?
That's a--

83
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,625
[AKECHI]
Great idea.

84
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,208
What are we waiting for?

85
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,083
[HASHIBA]
Akechi?

86
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,041
I thought you said you
weren't interested in helping.

87
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,458
I did, but I decided it
was the right thing to do.

88
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,208
Glad to see that you
have a sensitive side!

But wow! Amazing!

92
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,875
You're practically
indistinguishable!

93
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,500
[SHADOW-MAN]
Kobayashi, right?

94
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,416
I'd like to talk to you.

95
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,500
I'd like talk to
you too, Shadow-Man.

96
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,250
I can't believe he actually
wears a paper bag on his head.

97
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,791
[KOBAYASHI]
If you're really a kidnapper,

98
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,916
what's the point
in talking to me?

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,250
[SHADOW-MAN]
Girls are precious gems.

100
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,458
They're like little
angels on Earth.

101
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,125
I could never harm a girl,

102
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,041
and I would never abduct
one against her will.

103
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,250
I am also looking
for the kidnapper.

104
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,083
Sachiko Oosone is a dear friend.

105
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,541
I'm worried that she might
have been captured by him.

106
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,208
I'm doing all that
I can to find her,

107
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,708
but there are some
things I can't do alone.

108
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,541
[KOBAYASHI] A membership
pass to an internet café?

109
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,708
Female?

110
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,916
But this is a girl's card.

111
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,958
Oh, I get it!

112
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,458
You want me to go undercover!

113
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,833
That way, maybe I'll
be abducted too!

114
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,083
What?!

115
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,500
[SHADOW-MAN] I can
disguise myself as anyone

116
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,083
but a little girl.

117
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,666
With any luck you'll be able to
lure the kidnapper right to you.

118
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,416
I think it's our best chance.

119
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,625
[HASHIBA]
You want him to be a decoy!

120
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,541
And on top of everything else,

121
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,000
you want him to dress
up like a girl, too?!

122
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,208
Hey! Hold on! Come back!

123
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,250
Are you listening?

124
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,000
This is way too dangerous!

125
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,291
And I'm never gonna let
him do it! You hear me?

Never!

[SHADOW-MAN]
Sachiko Oosone, lost her mother

128
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,333
when she was very young.

129
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,708
Yet, she was such a happy child.

Always kind and loving...
despite what fate had in store.

Are you sure?

00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,000
[NURSE B]
I'm afraid so.

It's the same disease
her mother had.

136

[NURSE A] Let's try to
make her comfortable.

[SACHIKO'S FATHER] Are you
in any pain, Sweetheart?

you don't have to come
visit me every day.

143
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,250
[SHADOW-MAN]
The sicker she became,

144
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,750
the harder it was
for him to see her.

145
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,458
She worried that he might have
been reminded of her mother,

146
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,708
so she did everything she could
to keep him from suffering.

147
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,541
[OLD MAN] I see someone
just woke up from her nap!

148

Tell me, Sachiko, were
you a good girl today?

149
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,625
Yep! The nurses said
they were happy

150
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,125
'cause I ate every
little bit on my plate!

151
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,416
[SHADOW-MAN] Sometimes an
old man would visit her.

152
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,208
He was a kindly patient
from another room.

153
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,916
By that time, there weren't many
others who came to see her,

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,250
so the old man would
stay for hours

155
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,041
until he was sure she was happy.

156
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,208
[SACHIKO'S FATHER]
Isn't there anything you can do?

157
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,583
There's no way I can afford it!

disease was too great.

160

Her father was heart broken.

[SACHIKO'S FATHER]
Sachiko... I-I'm sorry.

[SACHIKO]
Uh... I know some!

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,625
Walk through the
cherry blossoms,

167
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,500
go play at a park and the beach.

168
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:59,208
But... I mostly wanna
go back to school.

169
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,375
I miss seeing my friends.

170
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,166
I miss my teacher.

171
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm so afraid that
they'll all forget me!

00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,541
[NURSE C]
Please don't cry.

Listen, I'm sure you'll
get better very soon.

[KOBAYASHI]
Tell you what.

186
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,083
If it makes you feel better,

187
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,750
I can keep my
cell phone with me.

188

If we use GPS, you'll
always know my location.

So then there's nothing

me to do with your underwear?!

193
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,666
[KOBAYASHI]
You don't have to do anything.

Just hold them for a minute.

Right, sure, no big deal.

I think... you look fine.

201
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,041
[KOBAYASHI] When it's
late night at the café,

202
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,916
a young girl who
walks in by herself

203
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,250
would no doubt be a good
target for the kidnapper.

204
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,500
It might go like this:

205
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,750
A girl is given a booth
in a low-traffic area.

206
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,125
Wait. So-- [gasps]

207
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,375
[KOBAYASHI] After that,
the predator drugs her food.

208
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,958
Now he has to get
her out somehow,

209
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,375
without being seen by
the security cameras.

210
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,833
So he hides her in a trash bin

211
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,916
and pushes her out
the back door.

212
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,583
[KOBAYASHI] Along the way,
the kidnapper makes sure

213
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,833
to dispose of anything that

214
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,333
could possibly
help track her down.

00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,416
I absolutely love going
to school every day,

317
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,166
and I have more best
friends than I can count!

318
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,416
Last Spring, I saw
cherry blossoms.

319
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,000
In Summer, I got
to visit the ocean

320
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,875
and play on the beach
for the first time.

321
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,625
When the snow melts, I'll get
to go to the amusement park!

322
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:14,166
[SHADOW-MAN]
And you feel happy? Every day?

323
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,166
[SHADOW-MAN]
Will you wear this?

324
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,833
To remember me?

325
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,250
Is this for people to wear?
It looks like a cat collar.

326
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,541
[SHADOW-MAN] I guess I have
an odd fashion sense, huh?

327
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,166
[laughs]

328
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,125
Sachiko?

329
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,083
You'll never suffer again.

330
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,041
From now on, your life
will be a happy one.

331
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,541
Let this necklace be a reminder

332
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,958
that if anything tough
or scary happens,

333
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,416
I'll always come help to you...

334
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,750
That's a promise.

335
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,083
[SACHIKO]
A promise?

336
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,541
[SHADOW-MAN]
Yes. My promise to you.

337
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,416
[SHADOW-MAN]
My... promise...

338
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,750
[SHADOW-MAN]
I'm sorry...

339
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:56,875
I lied.

340
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,708
I couldn't protect you.

341
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:02,666
[cries]

342
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,125
[door creaks]

343
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,041
[WATANUKI]
Who's down there?

344
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,541
[SHADOW-MAN crying]

345
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,416
[WATANUKI]
Get away from that.

346
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,166
It belongs to me.

347
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,625
[SHADOW-MAN yells]

--[WATANUKI] Why'd ya do that?
--[SHADOW-MAN grunts]

[SHADOW-MAN groans, sobs]

350
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,166
[WATANUKI]
Wait a minute.

351
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,041
I've seen you somewhere before.

352
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,708
Oh yeah, you're that
Shadow-Man guy, right?

353
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,166
Weirdo.

354
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,166
Hey, so do ya wanna
know something?

355
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,625
One time I dressed up like you
and led a girl down here.

356
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:32,916
[SHADOW-MAN]
Tell me.

357
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,791
Why did you kill her?

358
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,000
[WATANUKI]
Huh?

359
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,916
[SHADOW-MAN]
Tell me why you killed Sachiko!

360
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,375
[yells]

361
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,750
[WATANUKI]
Who's that?

362
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,583
Oh, yeah... Sachiko Oosone.

363
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,083
I remember her.

364
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,916
When I brought her here she
didn't wanna be my daughter.

365
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,958
I had no choice but
to get rid of her.

366
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,208
After I kill them,

367
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,583
I pour on the cement and
fit them into the wall.

368
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,791
I only keep the girls
who want to be mine.

369
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,916
[SHADOW-MAN] Every child
has the right to be happy.

370
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,791
No one deserves to suffer
the way these little girls do!

371
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,416
[SHADOW-MAN groaning]

372
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,083
[WATANUKI]
Hm?

373
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,625
[SHADOW-MAN] Sachiko,
wasn't supposed to die young!

374
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,375
She was finally healthy.

375
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,000
She went on adventures!

376
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,166
No...

377
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,416
Her happiness was
going to last forever!

378
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,791
[WATANUKI]
Hey, cut it out.

379
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,375
Stop!

380
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:27,625
[SHADOW-MAN] You stole Sachiko's
joy, her smile, her laughter.

381
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,750
You're really starting
to become annoying.

382
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,583
Get... off!

383
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,958
[SHADOW-MAN groaning]

384
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,000
[SHADOW-MAN]
Sachiko, deserved to live!

385
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,250
[WATANUKI]
You're creepin' me out!

386
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,458
[SHADOW-MAN groaning]

387
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,583
[SHADOW-MAN]
I won't forgive you!

388
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,250
I won't forgive you!
I won't forgive you!

389
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,041
[WATANUKI] Would you...
just... get offa my leg?

390
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,958
What are you, some
kind of psychopath?

391
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,125
[SHADOW-MAN]
I won't forgive you!

392
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,791
I won't forgive you!

393
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:58,583
I won't forgive you!
I won't forgive you!

394
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,791
[KAGAMI]
Watanuki! Freeze!

395
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,916
[HASHIBA]
Kobayashi! Are you in here?!

396
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,250
Don't be so hasty, young man.

397
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,375
[WATANUKI yells]
No! Get out!

398
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,500
You're not going to take
away my family again!

399
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,625
You hear me? I won't let you!

400
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,166
Wait! Akechi!

401
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,000
Watanuki! You're under arrest

402
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,541
for aggravated
kidnapping and murder!

403
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,291
[HASHIBA] Shadow-Man called
after you were kidnapped.

404
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,041
He let us know where
we could find you.

405
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,458
So I have to ask.

406
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,750
Did you already know
that it would be useless

407
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,041
for me to trace
your cell with GPS?

408
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,166
I really didn't want
to drag you into this.

409
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,666
[HASHIBA gasps]
Idiot.

410
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,625
Rely on me more.

411
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,875
[KOBAYASHI gasps]
Sorry...

412
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,375
[KOBAYASHI]
Is everything okay, Mr. Kagami?

413
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,583
[KAGAMI gasps]

414
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,500
Well, Watanuki was
previously charged with

415
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,875
committing a similar crime
against an underage girl.

416
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,500
He was acquitted and
released based on

417
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,541
the psychiatric evaluation
performed for that case.

418
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,541
So you're saying he's
a repeat offender.

419
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,541
That's right.

420
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,125
Kobayashi, listen.

421
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,375
You should never have done
this alone. You're too young--

422
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,375
[NAKAMURA]
Superintendent Kagami!

423
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,750
We've looked everywhere, but
there's no trace of Shadow-Man!

424
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,375
It's like he just
vanished into thin air.

425
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,041
[KAGAMI]
How does he do it?

426
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:37,166
Secure a perimeter and we'll
continue the investigation.

427
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,375
[AKECHI]
I got pulled into this

even though I said
I wasn't interested.

429

Kobayashi is a lot of trouble.

[HASHIBA] Aren't you even a tiny
bit relieved that he was safe?

431
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,375
What are those for?

432
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,583
[AKECHI]
For my muscles, of course.

433
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,250
Why, did you hurt yourself?

434

He was pretty stout.
I even dislocated my hip.

I know you're not going
out dressed that way!

No! That didn't help us!

You were kidnapped!

447
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,125
And that dress is way too short.
