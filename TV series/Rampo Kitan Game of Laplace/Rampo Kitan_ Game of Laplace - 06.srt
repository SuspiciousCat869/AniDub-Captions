00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,000
The worst-case scenario,
it's the real thing.

159
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,125
If it blows, it's gonna take
this entire floor with it.

160
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,625
Look, it says "GPS" on the side.

161
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,416
Fifty m slash three m?
What does that mean?

162
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,583
It has a distance limit.

163
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,041
[HASHIBA]
Wait. That means if he leaves--

164
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,916
If he leaves, it'll explode.

165
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,083
[HASHIBA]
Kobayashi, let's get outta here.

166
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,583
We'll go before it blows up.

167
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,750
Most of the wiring
is actually fake.

168
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,958
[HASHIBA] So you just have
to cut the real one, right?

169
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,166
But it's tricky.

170
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,750
If I take a guess and
cut the wrong wire,

171
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,250
we'll be dead in
the blink of an eye.

172
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,791
[HASHIBA]
Seriously, let's leave now.

173
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:25,791
[SHADOW-MAN]
What's the probability

174
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,083
of cutting the right one?

175
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,041
[AKECHI]
I'd say about one in thirty.

176
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,583
[SHADOW-MAN]
Well, I'll leave it to you.

177
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,125
No, you won't.

178
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,958
I'm not interested in having
my face blown off today, thanks.

179
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,166
[HASHIBA] Why don't you just
cut off the belt instead?

180
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,916
[AKECHI] They made it so
the bomb will detonate

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,333
if the belt is cut or
if heat's applied to it.

182
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,708
Well, it looks like we're gonna

183
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,791
need to call in an
expert after all.

184
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:44,916
Yep, I agree.

185
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,666
So how did you
manage to get a bomb

186
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,500
planted on you in
the first place?

187
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,625
[SHADOW-MAN]
I honestly don't recall.

188
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,833
The last thing I can
remember was checking out

189
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,625
at the counter at
the video rental shop.

190
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,375
And then, when I
woke up, I was here!

191
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,041
That video rental place
sounds a little suspicious.

192
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,166
You think you might have done
something to tick them off?

193
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,458
[SHADOW-MAN]
I've done nothing wrong.

194
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,958
You're kidding, right?

195
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,458
[SHADOW-MAN gasps] Are you
talking about my daily patrol

196
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,500
of the route elementary
girls take to school?

197
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,416
It makes me the portrait
of a good citizen.

198
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,708
[HASHIBA]
It makes you a creepy pervert.

199
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,333
[AKECHI] Enough. Just take
him to the police already.

200
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,041
[SHADOW-MAN] Now hold on
there a minute, Akechi.

201
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,250
If you abandon me now,

202

them about your bu--

That's why.

208
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,583
As such, I can easily
access any secret I want.

209

You play dirty.

210

[KOBAYASHI] What were you
gonna say about Akechi?

211
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,875
Oh! He's got his childhoo--

212
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,041
Okay, you win. Not another
word from you, got it?

213
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,250

What on earth is his secret?

[AKECHI]
What the...?

216
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,791
It's coming from the front door.

Wow, it's a baby.

--[SHADOW-MAN] What?!
--[HASHIBA gasps]

223
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,000
So you're the baby's dad?

00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,000
No!

225
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,083
[SHADOW-MAN]
But you're so young!

226

Did you hear me?
I don't know this kid!

227

Putting that question
aside for a minute.

228
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,750
Well, why's your place suddenly
being treated like an orphanage?

229
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,250
Who could be doing this to me?

230
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,916
[HOSTESS A] Hey, have you
guys heard the rumor that

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,708
that place is a

Seriously? That's so cool!

go ask them for some advice.

[HOSTESS A]
Why? You in trouble, Honey?

Yeah, it must be them.

up to be a real beauty.

[KOBAYASHI]
How can you tell?

244
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,375
[SHADOW-MAN] When you watch
people as much as I do,

245
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,416
you can see it.

Wow...

Hey. It's way too
crowded in here.

A perv, a bomb,
a cat, and a baby

should not be in the same
place at the same time, ever.

Why not?

[HASHIBA] I have to agree
with Akechi on this one.

All four of these issues
are jobs for the police.

Aw, things were just
getting exciting.

Indeed.

00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,666
is very fascinating,
I assure you.

313
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,166
But do you think you could
direct your attention

314
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,083
to the bomb strapped
to my chest now?

315
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,666
I swear to god, you're the
very worst part of this day.

316
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,083
Hey, guys! I think I
just had a brilliant idea!

317
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,416
[KOBAYASHI]
Plan A!

318
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,250
Since I'm the smallest
among the group,

319
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,458
I'll hide here with the
baby and the kitten.

320
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,583
When the extremists
downstairs aren't looking,

321
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,625
you guys will make an attempt
to escape from the building.

322
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,583
Sneak your way down
towards the exit,

323
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,166
but just before you
make a run for it,

324
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,333
you cause a huge commotion
to attract their attention.

325
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,375
While they're distracted, I'll
evacuate the baby and the cat.

326
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,166
Oh! The hostage, too.

327
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,166
And then, just as soon as
we're clear, the bomb explodes!

328
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,333
[ALL]
What?!

329
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,500
[KOBAYASHI] All the bad guys
will go down in the blast!

330
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,708
Problem solved!

331
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,500
[SHADOW-MAN]
Huh. Yeah, that's a good idea.

332
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,125
Wait, no! Now I'm dead!

333
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,583
[AKECHI]
So are Hashiba and me.

334
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,958
[HASHIBA]
Kobayashi...

335
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,416
[AKECHI]
All right, my turn.

336
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,625
Here's plan B.

337
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,041
[SHADOW-MAN]
Let's hear it.

338
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,875
[AKECHI] You disguise yourself
as one of the extremists

339
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,333
and infiltrate their ranks.

340
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,125
An extra member will
cause some confusion,

341
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,458
which buys us both time
and an advantage.

342
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,708
[SHADOW-MAN]
Go on?

343
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,208
[AKECHI] We take that
opportunity to escape

344
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,000
via the emergency stairway.

345
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,875
Then, while they're still
figuring out what happened,

346
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,125
the bomb goes off.

347
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,250
The extremists will be
completely wiped out

348
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,500
and we'll be saved.

349
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,125
[SHADOW-MAN] Yeah, that
kills two birds with--

350
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,666
Wait. No. I'm dead again.

351
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,958
[KOBAYASHI]
That's a solid plan.

352
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,291
[AKECHI]
Right?

353
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,708
[SHADOW-MAN] Do either of
you have hearts at all?

354
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,666
[HASHIBA]
Okay, here's plan C.

355
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,833
How about we try
something like this?

356
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,250
We turn on every tap
on the entire floor

357
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,541
so that it floods with water.

358
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,208
--[faucet squeaks]
--[water flowing]

359
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,833
[HASHIBA] And in a dilapidated
old building like this,

360
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,000
it won't take long for
it to leak downstairs.

361
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,666
[AKECHI] We had some
trouble with that very issue

362
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,125
just the other day.

363
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,833
[HASHIBA] I know. I was the
one who had to apologize.

364
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,458
[AKECHI] Well, you learned
your lesson, right?

365
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,833
[HASHIBA] The next thing we're
going to need is a battery.

366
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,083
If I remember correctly,

367
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,708
there were three of
them up on the roof.

368
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,083
[AKECHI]
The motorcycle batteries.

369
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,958
Very observant of you.
I'm impressed.

370
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,125
[HASHIBA]
I remember you saying

371
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,500
you couldn't ride your
motorcycle anymore

372
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,166
because of all your
outstanding tickets.

373
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,666
[AKECHI] So what, now you're
memorizing everything I say?

374
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,916
That sounds neurotic.

375
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,458
I'm not neurotic!

376
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,958
Now. Here's the most
important part.

377
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,291
Mr. Shadow-Man will disguise
himself as law enforcement.

378
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,166
[SHADOW-MAN]
Ooh!

379
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,208
[HASHIBA] He brings the
battery in to the extremists

380
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,416
as if it were their
300 million yen.

381
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,541
Then, he puts the battery
down on the floor,

382
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,541
which is now totally flooded.

383
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,875
[HASHIBA] The extremists will
all get an electric shock.

384
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,375
Not only that,
there's a good chance

385
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,875
it'll make the bomb explode,
so they'll all be wiped out!

386
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,125
[SHADOW-MAN]
Aah! Splendid!

387
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,208
We're all splendidly deceased!

388
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,583
[HASHIBA]
Yeah, I guess that's not good.

389
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,833
Nope, not even close.

390
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,125
[AKECHI]
Okay, then.

391
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,291
We'll have to find a
different way to kill him.

392
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,291
[SHADOW-MAN]
Wait a minute!

393
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,416
Since when is that
the goal here?!

394
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,916
[SHADOW-MAN sighs] I really
should have known better

395
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,375
than to ask for
help from you guys.

396

[KOBAYASHI] It's really
livening up downstairs!

How are you excited right now?!

00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,500
Plan D. We have no choice.

399
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,625
We have to try to
unlock that belt.

400
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:02,500
[HASHIBA]
What?

401
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,416
[SHADOW-MAN]
Really?

402
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,916
[AKECHI]
Whoever took the trouble

403
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,791
to plant that bomb on you
specifically brought you to me.

404
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,958
It's obviously intended
as a challenge.

405
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,458
Someone out there wants
to see me squirm.

406
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,333
[HASHIBA]
Any idea who it might be?

407
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,333
It could be any
number of people.

408
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:19,416
So, the task is to figure out
who'd harass Akechi like this.

409
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,083
It's true.

410
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,791
There's probably a ton of
people who don't like him.

411
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,333
So the challenge is
to narrow it down.

412
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,916
[HASHIBA]
There are eight numbers.

mistake, we're dead.

[KOBAYASHI] Could Mr. Shadow-Man
have staged this himself?

416
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,666
[SHADOW-MAN] Why would
I do something like that?

417
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,000
Well, maybe you wanted friends.

418
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,541
[SHADOW-MAN] Don't you
think it's pretty pathetic

419
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,833
if I have to go through this
much trouble to make friends?

420
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,708
[AKECHI] You are a pretty
pathetic guy, though.

If this is a challenge,

423
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,583
whoever did it must've
had a pretty good idea

424
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,791
that we wouldn't abandon
Mr. Shadow-Man, right?

00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,958
the moment I placed
you under arrest.

467
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,375
[BLACK LIZARD moans]
You didn't remember?

468
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,291
Oh, of course you didn't,
you little tease!

469
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,458
If this whole thing was
some kind of surprise party,

470
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,333
that's messed up.

[SHADOW-MAN]
Oh, I get it!

472
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,166
The clerk at the
video rental shop

473
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,125
was somehow in cahoots
with Black Lizard, huh?

474
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,500
[KOBAYASHI]
So, Ms. Black Lizard.

475
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,375
You used the baby to
stage all of this?

476
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,916
[BLACK LIZARD]
A baby? It's mine? With Akechi?

477
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,958
I mean, I've imagined
it so many times!

478
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,750
You're saying it
finally came true?

479
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,791
It's like she eats
stupid for breakfast.

480
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,208
[KOBAYASHI]
What about the cat?

481
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,208
[BLACK LIZARD] A cat?
There's a little kitty there?

482
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,916
Okay, what about the robbery?

483
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,916
[BLACK LIZARD] Robbery? No, I
don't know anything about that.

484
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,833
So the baby, the cat,
and the robbery

485
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,666
weren't connected at all? Wow.

486
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,416
[SHADOW-MAN]
What a strange coincidence.

487
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,666
Like all the planets
lining up at once.

488

Can you please take her, Akechi?

[AKECHI] A cat, a baby,

I think my head's
gonna ache for a week.

Stop impersonating me!

Oh, Akechi!

497
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,333
I didn't see you there!

498
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,750
Go home.

499
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,500
[SHADOW-MAN] Of course!
Right after I watch this DVD!

Spoiler alert:
the annoying bag-head pervert

Well, Kobayashi.

503
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,083
I think it's time to take
the baby to the police.

--May I ask who you are?
--[HOSTESS C gasps]

00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,000
[KOBAYASHI]
Are you really her mother?

512
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm so sorry.

513
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,083
I heard a rumor this
was a detective agency

514
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,416
that helped people in trouble,

515
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,083
and that you never
turned anyone away.

516
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,166
Where the hell would
anyone get that idea?

517
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,000
Is there any way
you can convince us

518
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,750
this baby belongs to you?

[HASHIBA]
Do you have any kind of proof

520
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,416
that she's your daughter?

521
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,125
Some proof?

522
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,375
Yes, the birthmark!

523
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,583
She has a tiny, sort of
heart-shaped birthmark

right on her bottom!

you keep feeding her, right?

anything to kittens.
