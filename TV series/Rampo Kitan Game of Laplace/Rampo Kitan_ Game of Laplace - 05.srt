1
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:21,791
What would drive you

2
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,458
to become a serial killer,
Superintendent Kagami?

3
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,333
[KAGAMI]
Don't call me that.

4
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,750
I'm not a
superintendent anymore.

5
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:37,041
[KAGAMI] I'm starting to think
it was destined to end this way.

6
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,916
The moment that someone like me

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,291
became a member of
law enforcement.

8
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,791
Congratulations!

9
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,500
[KAGAMI] We lost our parents
while I was still in college.

10
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:52,791
I had started working part-time

11
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,833
so my kid sister
Tokiko could move in.

12
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,000
But we needed something steady.

13
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,250
We were so close back then.

14
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,750
My brother, with a career
in law enforcement!

15
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,291
With a state job like this,
you're set for life!

16
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,583
Yeah.

17
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,500
We shouldn't have to worry
about money anymore.

18
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:10,000
And I'll be able to support
your fashion career.

19
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,375
[TOKIKO]
Kagami!

20
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,791
Don't make me your charity
case, I'll be fine.

21
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,958
And while you're at it,
enough about budgets!

22
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,083

bad luck, if you're running

38
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:56,208
into a homicide your
first day, Little Kagami.

Wait, what? Little?

You're not talkin'
to me, are ya?

41

Uh, yeah? Who else would I mean?

[KAGAMI]
Hey! I don't like that! 

43
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,625
C'mon, Little Kagami.

44
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,666
[KAGAMI] That first day,
I made a solemn vow.

45
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,041
Not just to the force,
but to myself.

46
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:12,125
To do everything I could
to protect the innocent.

47
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:50,958
[door rattles]

48
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,875
[TOKIKO]
Oh, I didn't know you were back.

49
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,583
[KAGAMI]
I didn't know you were still up.

50
00:03:56,666 --> 00:04:00,291
I've been working on my
portfolio for that competition.

51
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,750
Kagami... You've been
coming home late every day.

52
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,083
Do the police really demand
that much from a rookie cop?

53
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,708
Yeah. That's just how it is.

54
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,000
[TOKIKO] Well, don't
push yourself too hard.

55
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,916
[KAGAMI]
Look, Tokiko.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,166
Sad things happen
every day in this world.

57
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,875
And when you're a detective,
it's impossible to ignore them.

58
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:25,458
So I view it as my job
to make things less sad.

59
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,208
[TOKIKO]
But I know how you can get.

60
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,833
You can't help everyone, Kagami.

61
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,041
You'll burn out.

62
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,583
And then I'll be
the one who's sad.

63
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,625
You worry too much,
you know that?

64
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:38,041
Excuse me for caring about
the only family I have left.

65
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,166
Now, show you care
by going to bed!

66
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,333
Yeah, okay. Whatever.

67
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,875
But hey, you don't
push too hard, either.

68
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,250
[TOKIKO]
I won't.

Yes, thank you, sir.

Couldn't have done it without
your help, Mister Nakamura.

74

This was your first
arrest, wasn't it?

Well... Guess I can't
call ya "little" now.

She's making dinner tonight,

so she wants me sitting at
the table by six o'clock sharp.

She really needs a boyfriend.

Well, that's interesting.

91
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,916
All this time I thought you
might be running around

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,791
with some guy's wife, but
it's just your younger sister.

What?

94
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,833
[NAKAMURA] I'll be sure to
tell the girls in the office

95
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,416
that not only aren't you dating
anyone, you've got a big heart.

96
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
You're the most eligible
bachelor on the force.

Hey! Nakamura, c'mon!

98
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,750
[KAGAMI] Violent crimes
happened all the time.

99
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,375
The workload grew and grew.

100
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,041
But I never got angry.

101
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,875
If anything, I felt a
great sense of purpose.

102
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,291
I wanted to protect
the innocent.

103
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:13,375
But then came the day, where
I felt that purpose waver.

104
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,041
Acquitted?!

105
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,625
Yeah, the guy you nabbed
for those street attacks

106
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,291
won't set foot inside a cell.

107
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,041
And he wasn't acquitted, they
dropped the charges altogether.

108
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,833
Not that it really
matters in the end.

109
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,666
[KAGAMI]
What? Why would they do that?!

110
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,750
"Due to pathological
intoxication

111
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,708
caused by heavy drinking,
means the accused could be

112
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,125
considered temporarily
insane during his attacks,

113
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,291
and thus, not
legally responsible."

114
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,250
Basically, the State
can't charge this guy

115
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,958
because he was drunk
when he did it.

116
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,583
The insanity defense?!

117
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,458
That's like something
out of a bad TV show.

118
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,375
It's not gonna work
in a real trial!

119
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,166
[NAKAMURA]
Yeah, if it even goes to trial.

120
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,333
See, if an initial
psych eval on a perp

121
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,750
comes back with any
possibility of insanity,

122
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,708
they don't even
bother to prosecute.

123
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:56,958
Huh.

124
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,375
[NAKAMURA] Because an
insane defendant means

125
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:02,291
there's a damn good chance
the state loses at trial.

126
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,625
And trial losses hurt

127
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,958
a prosecutor's
chances at promotion.

128
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,500
Look. No matter what,

129
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,750
they're still gonna send the
guy to a psychiatric hospital.

130
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,791
[KAGAMI] On average, suspects
committed to psych hospitals

131
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,375
end up back on the streets
in just a few months.

132
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,375
Which is exactly what happened
with that first man I arrested.

133
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,583
And sure enough,
he killed again.

134
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,500
This latest murder was committed
by a man the police released

135
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,916
after dropping a previous
set of murder charges.

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,375
It's quite unfortunate.

137
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,750
And I'm afraid, fairly common.

138
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,583
Under the current penal
code, criminals found to be

139
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,833
legally incompetent due to
insanity cannot be punished.

140
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,250
[NEWSCASTER 4A]
So we're supposed to accept

insane murderers
walking the streets?

142
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,791
[SCHOLAR] No, no. After the
state drops criminal charges...

00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,291
Tokiko...

159
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,666
[TOKIKO] But compared to
everything you do, I'm nothing.

160
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,083
Nobody likes my designs.

161
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,916
My last one didn't get
a single good review.

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,375
[KAGAMI]
It wasn't fair.

163
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,666
I knew better than anyone--
especially critics--

164
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,208
how hard my sister worked
and how talented she was.

165
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,791
She worked hard every day
on her college assignments,

166
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,333
never doing anything
with friends.

167
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,541
And then she'd spend what little
free time she had at night

168
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,875
working on her designs.

169
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,458
Someone will recognize
your talent soon.

170
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,333
I'm sure of it.

171
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,416
You're the best.

172
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,833
Thank you.

173
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,583
There're so many.

174
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,083
What are you looking at there?

175
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,500
Mister Nakamura.

176
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,833
[NAKAMURA]
Coffee?

177
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,250
Thanks, I could use it.

178
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,708
I was looking through
all the cases

179
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,791
where the State
declined to indict.

180
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,458
There are way more
than I thought.

181
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:11,333
Yeah, I think last year
for murder cases,

182
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,458
it was a little less than half.

183
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,916
Hard to believe one out of
every two murderers we catch

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,250
ends up back on the streets.

185
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,791
Then what's the point?!

186
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:23,375
Why are we even bothering to
catch them in the first place?!

187
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,000
This isn't justice.

188
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,041
Yeah, sure is a cluster.

189
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,375
[NAKAMURA]
You ever hear of "Twenty Faces"?

190
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,458
[KAGAMI gasps]

191
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,625
Yeah. I mean, how could I not?

192
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,208
He was all over the
news last year.

193
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,541
A serial killer who only
kills other criminals.

194
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,875
Seems like he's bothered
by the same problem

195
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,208
that you've discovered.

196
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,083
Though, I'm no fan of
his solution to it.

197
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,625
It's arrogant for a man to think

198
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,458
he alone can identify
and punish evil.

199
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,625
Be careful how you
define "justice."

200
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:59,541
[KAGAMI] Not long after that
night, I first met... him.

201
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,791
You Keisuke Kagami?

202
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,833
Akechi. Detective.

203
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,750
Imperial Agency?

204
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,291
[AKECHI]
From here on out,

205
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,166
loop me in on any new evidence
you turn up on Twenty Faces.

206
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,250
Or on those you think
are just copycats.

207
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,958
Sure, but that's a
pretty big request.

208
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,916
I mean, I get what your
badge entitles you to.

209
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,625
I'm still a rookie, though.

210
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,375
If anything, you should
ask my supervisor--

211
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,666
I looked at the profiles of

212
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,250
every detective
in this precinct.

213
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,791
You seemed like the most
honest and trustworthy.

214
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:36,416
But... Men like you
tend to corrupt easily.

215
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,666
Don't let the darkness take you.

216
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,208
[KAGAMI]
Twenty Faces' vigilantism

217
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:54,125
spoke to my raw emotions,
but I wasn't so easily seduced.

218
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,416
I still believed
in the rule of law.

219
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,625
So I listened to reason

220
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,833
and tried to stay on
the straight and narrow.

221
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,541
I focused on the
righteousness of my work.

222
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,416
The traditional idea of justice.

223
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,916
And it served me well.

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,458
I got promoted to
superintendent.

225
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,250
[NAKAMURA] I guess
I gotta be more respectful

226
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,791
in how I address you now.

227
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,791
[KAGAMI gasps]
Oh, come on.

228
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,375
You really don't have
to change anything.

229
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,333
My dad always said
any organization

230
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,458
that doesn't have clearly
defined hierarchies

231
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,250
won't succeed in the long run.

232
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,833
It's important that you
own your higher position.

233
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,250
Superintendent Kagami.

234
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,833
You're right.

235
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,208
[KAGAMI] But throwing myself
into a police career like that,

236
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,833
meant that I was ignoring
my deep-seated doubts,

237
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:36,000
instead of confronting them
head-on like I should have.

238
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,375
[KAGAMI]
Huh?

239
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,333
[TOKIKO snoring]

240
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,416
[KAGAMI sighs]
Hey, Tokiko.

241
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,041
You'll hurt your back sleeping
on the couch like that.

242
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,958
[TOKIKO]
Next time...

243
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,541
They'll definitely...
like them next time.

244
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,708
[KAGAMI gasps]

245
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:02,875
Yeah.

246
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,625
You're working too hard.

247
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,416
You'll make it big someday.

248
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,833
I'm positive.

249
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,375
[KAGAMI]
But there are just...

250
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,625
...too many criminals who
don't have human hearts.

251
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,625
And the fact hardened my own.

252
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,166
It's over!

253
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,625
Man... I'm outta shape.

254
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,125
[KAGAMI] You're under
arrest, you monster!

[SUNAGA laughs]

256
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,791
Hey...

257
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:32,833
I've been in and outta plenty
of psychiatric hospitals before.

258
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,083
I bet ya.

259
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,541
I get acquitted due
to reasons of insanity

260
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,458
if it ever goes to trial.

261
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,625
One thing me and the
government have in common

262
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,083
is we don't put much
value on people's lives!

263

Don't do it!

You'll be no better than him.

[SUNAGA laughing]

268
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,416
[WATANUKI]
Haven't you learned

269
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,708
that it's foolish for you
to keep arresting me?

270
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:01,958
What?

271
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,791
As long as the eggheads
say I'm mentally ill,

272
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,583
I won't be competent
enough to stand trial.

273
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,583
That's why you keep dropping
the charges and releasing me.

274
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,958
Don't underestimate justice.

275
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,541
It won't let you get away
with your crimes forever!

276
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,458
Yeah, but even if
I was convicted,

277
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,791
they'd give me a light sentence

278
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,416
due to what they call,
"reduced mental capacity."

279
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,125
And since I'm rich,
once I'm free,

280
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,791
I could still live with a--

--[WATANUKI] You can't hit me!
--[NAKAMURA] Superintendent, no!

285

class of citizen!

Are you feeling less crazy now?

287
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,041
I'm so sorry.

288
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,083
I got too emotional.

[sighs]

290
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,250
It's bad timing, but you
should hear it from me.

291
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,875
They declined to indict that
frog-faced creep, Sunaga.

292
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,291
They're recommending
he be committed

293
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,500
to a psychiatric hospital.

294
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,333
[KAGAMI]
I see.

295
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,000
[NAKAMURA] Look, don't let
any of this discourage you.

296

This sorta case--

297
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,916
you've seen a lot of 'em, right?

298
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,625
Helluva lot more
than me, I assume.

299
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,250
I just-- How have you
kept from losing it?

300
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,541
Well, I developed my own
take on how things work.

301
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,041
Even if they don't get indicted,
let alone convicted,

302
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,750
the time we do have
them under arrest

303
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,583
keeps them from
committing some crime,

304
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,500
at least for a little while.

305
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,416
I don't look it now, but when
I first started this gig,

306
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,708
I was by far the most passionate
detective in the precinct.

307
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,125
I can't.

308
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,500
Rationalizing things like
that, it's not who I am.

309
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,416
Yeah, you're stubborn.

310
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,541
[KAGAMI]
Sunaga walking changed me.

311
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,666
I had pushed down the
darkness, deep into my soul.

312
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,416
But now I started
seeing it again.

00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,208
Sorry. Just got back.

317
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,000
Why don't you turn
on some lights?

318
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,375
You hungry?
You want some dinner?

319
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,875
Yeah, that'd be great.

320
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,250
'Kay. I'll whip something up.
It won't be fancy, though!

321
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,375
[TOKIKO]
So, does it taste good?

322
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,000
[KAGAMI]
It's perfect.

323
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,583
[TOKIKO chuckles]

324
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,083
Before you joined the police,
we ate dinner every night

325
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,000
and now I barely
remember your face.

326
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,375
I feel so lonely.

327
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,291
[KAGAMI]
Tokiko, you sound like a child.

328
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,250
[TOKIKO growls]

329
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,708
You're comparing me to a child

330
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,416
when you can't even
make your own dinner?

331
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,291
Hold on!

332
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,000
I almost forget to tell you!

333
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:34,625
[KAGAMI]
What?

334
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:35,958
[TOKIKO chuckles]

335
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,375
You ready?

336
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,708
That blue dress pattern I
came up with a while back.

337
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,625
I got second place at
the design competition!

338
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,208
Tokiko, that's awesome!

339
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,583
[TOKIKO] My teachers and
classmates were totally shocked.

340
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,375
I mean, in a good way.

341
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,875
That's great to hear.

342
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,791
I'm so proud of you.

343
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,583
[KAGAMI]
Well, that settles that.

344
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,458
Tomorrow, I am definitely
coming home early to celebrate.

345
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,083
I'll pick up a cake, too.

346
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,208
That's the first time I've seen

347
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,000
a real smile on your
face in months.

348
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,250
[YOUNG MAN 4A]
Hm... Sorry, Pal.

349
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,083
I don't remember.

350
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,083
No problem.

351
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,916
Thank you.

352
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,041
[sighs]

353
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,125
So much for getting home early.

354
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:37,125
[phone rings]

355
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,500
Yeah, what's goin' on?

356
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,250
[NAKAMURA] Sorry to bug you,
but it's urgent.

357
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,958
What, did something happen?

358
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,208
[NAKAMURA] Sunaga escaped
from the psych hospital.

359
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,458
[KAGAMI]
What?!

360
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,875
[NAKAMURA] He killed a
nurse on his way out.

361
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,375
[KAGAMI gasps]

362
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,541
[NAKAMURA] And he sent us a
threatening email that says,

363
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,541
"As revenge for my arrest
at the hands of

364
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:57,125
Superintendent Keisuke Kagami,
I'm going to kill his family."

365
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,291
Are you with your
sister right now?

366
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,125
No. I was finishing
up on another case.

367
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,083
Far as I know, she's at home.

368
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,583
I'm on my way there right now.

369
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,583
[NAKAMURA] You need to get
to her as quickly as possible!

370
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,916
Yeah... Yeah!

371

[phone dialing]

00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,250
Pick up, Tokiko!

Tokiko!

374
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,125
Pick up!

375
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,708
[NAKAMURA]
We found her.

376
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,500
Your sister's body was
severely mutilated.

377
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:42,625
Kagami...

378
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,500
I'm so sorry.

[KAGAMI]
What was I thinking being a cop?

386
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,791
It's all been a waste
of time and life!

387
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,791
The law can't protect anyone!

388
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,708
[KAGAMI]
We can't deter crime

389
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,583
with bureaucrats
waving around badges.

390
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,583
We need something stronger.

391
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,791
Something far, far stronger.

392
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,791
I knew it was only a matter
of time until you caught me.

393
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,375
So I did what I could.

394
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,916
Punished as many as possible,
even if it meant I got sloppy.

395
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,625
And just like when
I was an honest cop,

396
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,625
I worked day and night at it.

397
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,750
I couldn't help but notice

398
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:24,666
that Sunaga wasn't among
the bodies we found.

399
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,750
Does that mean you
didn't kill him?

400
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,333
No.

401
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,541
He's still alive.

402
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,458
I'd never just kill him.

403
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,458
[KAGAMI] I started by
gouging out his eyes.

404
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,375
Then, I cut off his limbs.

405
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,875
They're melting in
a tub at my home,

406
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,708
while what's left of
him soaks in chemicals

407
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,791
that slowly eat him alive.

408
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:47,208
I want him to look exactly
like Tokiko did when she died.

409
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,833
[KAGAMI] And that's...
almost the end of my tragedy.

410
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,625
All that's left is for you
to condemn me to death.

411
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,333
You can't let criminals go.

412
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,625
You must punish them.

00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,375

How could you do these things?

Why couldn't you stay the Little

[SACHIKO'S FATHER]
You took my daughter from me.

You killed... my Sachiko!

426

This is your judgement!
