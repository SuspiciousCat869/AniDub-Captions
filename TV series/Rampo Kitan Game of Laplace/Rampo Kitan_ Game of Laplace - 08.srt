00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:21,875
[NAMIKOSHI]
So, Akechi.

2
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,958
What do you think?

3
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,291
It's brilliant, but reckless.

4
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,875
Complex systems.

5
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,750
Is this Chaos theory?

6
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:33,291
Yes, that's right, but
it's just the beginning.

7
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,541
The fundamentals involved
are quite similar,

8
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,500
but the goal of my formula
is to ascertain the future.

9
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,458
I'm creating a program that
predicts every possible position

10
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,375
of all matter in the
world at any given time.

11
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,083
[AKECHI]
Intriguing.

12
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,000
But, how will it be
able to reconcile

13
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,416
with quantum mechanics?

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,208
Uh! That must be why
you're using Chaos Theory.

15
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,750
[NAMIKOSHI]
Mm-hm. Exactly.

16
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:59,041
My goal is to create
Laplace's Demon.

17
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,541
I'd like my demon to assist
in altering the future.

18
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,958
Intervening in tangible ways.

19
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,208
Then the first thing
to do is give it a name.

20
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,333
A name?

21
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,166
This demon's your
own creation.

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,208
It doesn't make sense to
borrow someone else's.

23
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,250
[NAMIKOSHI gasps]

24
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:19,083
[NAMIKOSHI] Then, what
do you think of this one?

25
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:24,166
An omniscient law to shed
light on the dark world.

26
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,125
"Dark Star."

29

[AKECHI]
There's only one thing left.

30
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,958
What was the motivation
behind the murders?

31
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,625
[KOBAYASHI] Have you really
figured out everything else?

32
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:17,958
[AKECHI]
Pretty much.

33
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:22,291
A company creates a theme
park, Panorama Island.

34
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,708
Then two high-profile
men were found dead.

35
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,750
[AKECHI]
Eccentric dreamers.

36
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,666
They were partners
who conceived the idea

37
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,208
and followed it through.

38
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,666
This morning,

39
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,875
the Shinjuku Metropolitan
Police received a challenge:

40
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,166
An invitation to solve
an impossible crime

41
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,083
on Panorama Island.

42
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,750
It was, without a doubt,

43
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,750
sent by Twenty Faces.

44
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,208
It's not an accident.

45
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,250
They were murdered.

46

[MINAMI]
I'm Medical Examiner Minami!

And I'm Corpsey!

[MINAMI] I'm back again
with some useful info!

50
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,500
We already covered
the cause of death

51
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,125
was either crushing
or suffocation,

52
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,375
but details are important
so let's take a closer look!

53
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,041
We have to do it again?

54
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,208
[MINAMI]
There are two victims,

and Hirosuke Hitomi!

56

Do you really need
two of us for this?

57
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,166
One is probably enough!

58
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,375
It helps with the effect.

59
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,708
[MINAMI]
The murderer called these two

60
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,000
into the exhibition hall,
and, three, two, one!

61
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,416
[ALL scream]

62
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,666
[MINAMI]
There ya have it!

63
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,083
That's it for today's
Three-Minute Shocking!

64
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,166
Am I missing something?
There's nothing new!

65
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,625
[MINAMI] The fact that
the victims were called

66
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,750
into the exhibition hall
is essential to the case!

67
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,958
If someone lured them in knowing
that everything was about

68
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,083
to fall, it's obviously a
mannequin manslaughter!

69
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,750
In conclusion, I
believe that this was

70
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,333
a premeditated murder by someone
who anticipated the collapse!

71
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,083
See you next time!

72
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,333
[AKECHI] I'm assuming this
gear is part of a larger set

73
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,791
of mechanical systems
used in the hall?

74
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,291
It just might be.

75
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,083
The entire exhibition hall
has motorized parts installed

76
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,416
in the ceiling.
Take a look up there.

77
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,208
We were eventually going
to run electricity to it.

78
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,125
[KOBAYASH] Were all of
these going to move?

[TSUNODA]
Yeah, that was the plan.

80
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,625
Why, even the largest ones were
designed with a purpose in mind!

00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,291
[TSUNODA]
Charmain Komoda and Mr. Hitomi

82

if they were dancing!

83
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,541
I've never seen anything
like this before!

84
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,000
Maybe... the collapse was
caused by a loose bolt,

85
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,416
or some other flaw
in the machinery

86
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,041
that moved the mannequins?

[TSUNODA]
No, sir, absolutely not!

89
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,166
We had teams of architects
and engineers who perfected

90
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,291
the design of this area. Right?

91
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:24,000
Uh. Yes. The blueprints were
checked multiple times.

92
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,500
Every mechanism in this room

93
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,958
is made of the highest
quality materials available.

94
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,875
Then explain this.

Structures are as strong
as their weakest parts.

98
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,375
These flimsy gears are useless.

[AKECHI] So you're admitting
that you purposely

106
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,625
chose weak materials?

107
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,875
I can explain.

Ms. Higashikoji is the killer?

[AKECHI]
And why not?

111
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,000
Look, I understand the fact
that the metal is weak,

112
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,833
but how could she predict
the specific time

113
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,375
the machinery would collapse?

114
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:10,625
[KOBAYASHI] It's just math.
You can calculate it.

115

Calculate it, huh?

116
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,458
Are you really saying that to me
when you skipped the math exam?

117
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,583
[AKECHI] It's a question
of having the right tools.

118
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,791
A little knowledge of math and
a computer would be enough.

119

If someone has a degree

in both mechanical and
material engineering,

121
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,166
it'd be child's play.

There sure are a lot of you.

Was it frightening to

I think this kind of thing
would frighten anyone,

161
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,041
I just couldn't bear
the pain anymore.

162
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,375
[HIGASHIKOJI] It's true that
Komoda and Hitomi were

163
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,166
highly esteemed men in society,

164
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,000
but behind the scenes, they
made such callous sacrifices.

165
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:03,750
My friend, Yukiko Tezuka,
was only one of many.

166
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,083
Yukiko.

167
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,458
[HIGASHIKOJI] For weeks she'd
been forced to work over 20

168
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,958
hours a day. She had to
push herself to the point

169
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:14,125
of exhaustion or risk dealing
with the consequences.

170
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,833
She was so frail.

171
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,791
Her health was declining daily.

172
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,541
I didn't know what
to do for her.

173
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,583
[cries]

174
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,791
[HIGASHIKOJI]
And then, she died.

175
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,250
[HIGASHIKOJI]
Listen to me!

176
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,833
The least you could do is
apologize to her parents!

177
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,583
Chairman! Producer!

178
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,708
I'm impressed.

179
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,041
[HITOMI]
Yes, it's wonderful!

180
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,791
[KOMODA] We're a huge entity
that she'd normally be unable to

181
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,500
stand up to, but because of the
love for her dear companion.

182
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,250
[HITOMI] She dares to rise
fearlessly against us!

183
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,875
How courageous!
What a noble spirit!

184
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,666
My dear, there is no
doubt that you are....

185
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,625
[HIGASHIKOJI gasping]

186
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,416
[KOMODA, HITOMI] The ideal woman
that we have been searching for.

187
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,125
Our goddess to revere!

188
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,041
Don't do this. No!

189
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,375
[KOMODA]
You are truly the best, Chiyoko.

190
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,625
[HITOMI]
I never expected

191
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,250
that you'd have such
a beautiful body!

192
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,000
[KOMODA]
We agree to apologize

193
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,833
to the family of the
dead office worker.

194
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,750
We'll compensate them as well,
if it would please you.

195
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,416
[HITOMI] However, you must agree
to sign a contract with us.

196
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,750
Sign a contract?

197
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:26,000
She sold her body
to those men.

198
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,125
[HIGASHIKOJI]
They promised improvement.

199
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,958
I'll sign, if this is
what it will take.

200
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:37,000
[whimpers] I will give them...

201
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,625
my body.

202
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,833
[HIGASHIKOJI]
Why?!

203
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,458
The working conditions for
the Panorama Island project

204
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,125
are worse than before!

205
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,375
Nothing has changed
since Yukiko died!

206
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,041
[HITOMI]
Look what we've done, Chiyoko!

207
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,708
[KOMODA] It's a tribute to
display our devotion to beauty.

208
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:54,625
The fruit of our love!

209
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:55,750
[HITOMI]
This is an island made

210
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,916
to celebrate
everything about you!

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,916
[KOMODA] We were searching
for the perfect model

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,166
while we constructed
Panorama Island.

213
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,458
With you as our muse,

214
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,791
we can now complete the
island's focal point,

215
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:09,583
the mannequin exhibition hall,
in a most timely manner!

216
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,708
You will be worshiped
by millions,

217
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:15,375
and you will belong
to us forever!

218
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,333
Was it worth it, Yukiko?

219
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,583
With the money they
made from your work,

220
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:27,541
they created... so many.

221
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,541
They forced you to work
yourself to death.

222
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,833
And then...

223
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,375
They say I'm a goddess.

224
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,208
It's not fair!

225
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,291
[HIGASHIKOJI] I wanted to do
whatever I could to help those

226
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,916
who had no voice.

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,208
But I didn't change anything.

228
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:51,750
My body belongs to them now
and the employees still suffer.

229
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,250
Oh, Yukiko.

230
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,041
Did you know about
this from the start?

231
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,333
It was obvious.

232
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,875
So really, we did just
need to find the motive.

233
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,708
It's actually a simple case.

234
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:06,125
A woman sold herself to the two
demons who killed her friend.

235
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,208
To beat them, she became
a demon herself.

236
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,041
[HIGASHIKOJI]
It's true.

237
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:16,708
I murdered Chairman Komoda
and Mister Hitomi.

238
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:20,958
I'm the Twenty Faces
of Panorama Island.

239
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:29,750
[KAGAMI] Twenty Faces is on
the rise. You can't stop it.

240
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,625
When fueled by injustice,

241
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:37,333
the innocent can become
murderous vigilantes.

242
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,958
I don't understand why
she posed as Twenty Faces

243
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,125
and sent that letter.
The island's authorities

244
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,166
would have called the
murders an accident.

245
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,041
She wanted someoneto know.

246
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:47,666
What?

247
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,458
Her truth.

248
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,833
Sometimes beautiful things
are built through ugly means.

249
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,500
She wanted people to see
all of the sacrifices

250
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,416
that went into making
this beauty possible.

251
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,916
She's our fourth
Twenty Faces this month.

252
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,583
I wouldn't be surprised to
see multiple crimes like this

253
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,333
happening all at once.

254
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,875
If it ever gets to that,

255
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,416
there's no way you'll be able
to deal with them all alone.

256
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,875
If more Twenty Faces are out
there, I'll crush them all.

257
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,166
[NAKAMURA]
What?!

258
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,083
You can't send a helicopter?

259
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:22,875
Boat?

260
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,708
Oh, I understand.

261
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,333
[KOBAYASHI]
We can't be going home already!

262
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,333
We just got here.
I wanna swim!

263
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,416
Don't you?

264
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,958
[HASHIBA]
Well, I don't have a suit,

265
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,333
plus we don't have
time right now.

266
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,916
The boat is on the way.

267
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,750
[KOBAYASHI] I don't see
it yet. Just a quick dip!

268
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,375
Why are you doing that?!

269
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,791
Once the exam is over,

270
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,125
I'll take you to the beach
or anywhere you want to--

271
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,625
[AKECHI] You take good
care of him, Hashiba.

272
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,583
[HASHIBA]
Uh? I do?

273
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,916
[KOBAYASHI] Ms. Higashikoji.
She loved Yukiko.

274
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,041
It almost seems honorable
to kill for friendship, huh?

275
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,416
Well, I guess it could be,

276
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,333
since she was trying
to avenge her death.

277
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,416
Uh?!

278
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:58,750
[KOBAYASHI]
Hey, Hashiba!

279
00:12:58,833 --> 00:12:59,958
If I was ever murdered,

280
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,125
would you make a vow
to avenge my death?

281
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,125
Why would you even
ask that? I dunno.

282
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,000
I guess I'd just do
everything that I could

283
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,458
to keep you from dying.

284
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,250
Hey, no fair! It's a
yes or no question!

285
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,541
[HASHIBA]
Well, I'm saying I'd do my best

286
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,541
to make sure I never have
to make that choice.

287
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,791
[KOBAYASHI]
Mm?

288
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,125
[HASHIBA growls]
Even if I did avenge your death,

289
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,541
you wouldn't be
able to come back.

290
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,000
[KOBAYASHI]
I see.

291
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,416
[HASHIBA] Why would you even
ask a question like that?

292
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,708
[KOBAYASHI]
Just curious.

293
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:26,958
[HASHIBA]
Well, cut it out.

294
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,416
I don't even like thinking
about that stuff.

295
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,208
[KOBAYASHI]
Akechi, we made it home!

296
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,875
[AKECHI sighs] So you're
calling my place home now.

297
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,416
Hard not to!

298
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,458
We've been coming here every
day since exam week started.

299
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,333
Take this as a token
of our appreciation.

300
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,416
[KOBAYASHI] We actually
didn't come here yesterday.

301
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
[HASHIBA] That's because
we flew to an island.

302
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,041
I guess that's true.

303
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,208
[HASHIBA] By the way,
just thought I'd mention,

304
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,375
I know you skipped
the English test today.

305
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,250
[KOBAYASHI]
Hm...?

306
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,125
You slipped away after lunch.

307
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,500
Did you really think I wouldn't
notice that you disappeared?

308
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,875
I know how smart you are!

309
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,125
Why do you do things

310
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,333
that cause you to have
to take make-up exams.

311
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,208
[KOBAYASHI]
Hm.

312
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,125
[HASHIBA]
Don't 'Hm' me!

313
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,791
They don't interest me.
I won't take them.

314
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,333
[HASHIBA gasps]

To be honest, I didn't consider
anyone in my life a friend.

My intellect was
so high for a child

even keep up with me.

I guess so, but still.

We had more time and talent

than we knew
what to do with,

371
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,375
so we poured it all
into the formula.

00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,833
Everything needed to be compiled
and encrypted inside a network.
