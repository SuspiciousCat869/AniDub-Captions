In that moment,

I knew that my boredom
had come to an end.

Good morning, Officer.

00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,458
[KAGAMI]
So, that him?

00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,708
[POLICE A]
Yes, sir.

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,208
[KAGAMI]
I'll take it from here.

[POLICE B]
Yes, sir.

11
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,333
[KAGAMI] Well, young man, looks
like you're our key witness.

12
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,416
I hope you plan to cooperate.

13
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,791
Aren't I a suspect, though?

14

We haven't ruled it out.

15
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,458
Though at a glance,
my gut tells me

16
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,458
you're just a pawn
in all of this.

17
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,833
[HASHIBA]
Please let me through!

18
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,208

You can't go in!

00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,708
Hey, Hashiba.

21

[POLICE C]
Hold it!

22
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,625
Tell them there's no way
that you're the murderer!

23
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,166
I already did.

24
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,458
But when I woke up I
was the only one here.

25
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,333
But you had no reason for
killing the teacher, Kobayashi!

26
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,666
[POLICE C]
If you wanna make a statement

27
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,333
of your own, we can
take you in, too!

28
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,833
Alright, then! Fine,
I'll go in with him.

[POLICE C]
Who are you, kid?

30
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,875
I'm his best friend,
got it? He needs me!

31
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,583
[NAKAMURA] You're going to
have to do better than that.

32
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,875
Okay. I'm also his
class representative

33
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,916
and the President of
the Student Council.

34
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,750
I need to be able to
explain what's happened

35
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,250
to the other students.

36
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,041
[NAKAMURA] Well, at least
you're more on the ball

37
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,083
than your teachers.

38
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,000
But getting involved in this
case would be a mistake.

39
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,666
Go on, kid, go home.

40
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,458

Oh, he's okay.

45

[POLICE C]
Huh?

46
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,000
I asked him to come help out.

47
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:51,125
He's a licensed detective,
believe it or not.

So... Dismembered body of
a homeroom teacher, huh?

52
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,708
Very showy. I like it.

53
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,750
[KAGAMI] Don't be morbid in
front of the students, Akechi.

54
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,875
[AKECHI] Gotta say, this
looks pretty bad for you, kid.

[KOBAYASHI gasps]

56
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,791
Well, I'll just have to
prove I didn't do it.

57
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:25,041
And how're you gonna
do that, enlighten me.

58
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,916
By proving who did. Sir.

59

[door clicks, creaks]

60
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,250
I appreciate you coming
in to talk today.

61
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,833
[KOBAYASHI] Well,
considering that I was found

62
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,166
holding the murder weapon,

63
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,833
it's completely natural
for you to be suspicious.

64
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,541
Y'know, kid,
you're awfully calm.

65
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,791
Shouldn't I be?

66
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,875
So, do you still think
Kobayashi's guilty?

67
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:55,416
[sighs] Officially,
he's still a suspect.

68
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,833
But personally, I'm
inclined to believe you.

69
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,875
[NAKAMURA] You're lucky
you aren't of age, kid.

70
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,791
If you were, we would've
had to keep you here

71
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,833
until we were finished
with the investigation.

72
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,250
[KOBAYASHI]
Lucky me.

Crazy. There goes
our prime suspect.

76
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,083
You really feel okay about
releasing him like this?

77

We're following
Akechi's instructions.

78

Aah... the young
detective strikes again.

79
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,750
Seems a nice kid.

80
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,000
Hard to imagine he could have
done something like that.

81
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,666
Killing his homeroom teacher.

82

Well, they're definitely out
there, though-- Messed up kids.

83

You'd have'ta be naïve
to think they're not.

Right.

No, Nakamura, you're right.
We can't rule anything out.

found the killer, right?

it was obviously the kid

[STUDENT C] I can't believe
he's back at school already!

[STUDENT D]
If I was the new teacher,

95
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,708
I would not be good with that.

Hey, Hashiba.

So, um, is it true that

100
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,750
Kobayashi's the one who, uh...

101
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,208
There's no need to worry.

102
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,625
I was with him when he
went to the station.

103
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,375
They said they don't
believe he did it.

104
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,125
[STUDENT F]
Oh, okay.

105
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,958
[STUDENT E] Yeah, I guess
if you're cool with him.

You okay?

107
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,041
Don't listen to them, all right?

Oh, it's fine.

109
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,291
Doesn't bother me.

110

[HASHIBA gasps]
Well, that's good.

111
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,666
I mean, I get why they're upset.

112
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,541
After all, the suspect
is still among them.

113
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,750
But don't worry.

114
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,791
Once I figure out who
the real killer is,

115
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,750
hopefully, everyone will
be able to move on.

through quite a scare,

--pull together!
--[KOBAYASHI] The reason

129
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,416
the killer arranged the
body so deliberately

130
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,458
was because they were trying to
say the teacher deserved to die.

131
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,625
[KOBAYASHI]
When I woke up, it was morning.

132
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,250
Before that, I'd fallen
asleep in class.

No, it was more like I
had been put to sleep.

I can't think of another reason

I would've spent the
whole night here.

137
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,000
The person who did it
had to be in a position

138
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,833
to frame me for the murder.

139
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,250
That's right. The killer
is someone who knows me

to die laughing--

157
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,458
I totally thought you were
a girl when I saw you!

158
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,958
Believe me, I get
that all the time.

159
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,625
[STUDENT G]
Yeah, he's cuter than we are!

160
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,041
[STUDENT H] Even though he's
a boy; it's totally not fair.

161
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,541
[HOSHINO]
We all thought he was a girl

162
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,041
in elementary school, too!
He used to get embarrassed.

163
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:19,875
Remember?

164
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,750
Aw, is that true, Kobayashi?

165
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,958
--[KOBAYASHI chuckles]
--Aww! How sweet!

166
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,791
I'm so jealous of you
cute, young things!

167
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,916
[HASHIBA] Hey! What do
you think you're doing?!

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,583
[HANABISHI giggles] Sorry,
it's my first day as a teacher

169
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,375
and I tend to get a little bit
huggy when I'm nervous!

170
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,916
Anyhoo, see you tomorrow!

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,083
[STUDENT G] Ms. Hanabishi, I
love your outfit! It's so cute!

172
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,208
[HANABISHI] Oh, thank you,
Sweetie! How's the rest of me...

173
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,791
[HOSHINO] Our new teacher's
a little weird, isn't she?

174
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,166
Yeah, she is. But at least
she seems really nice.

175
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,416
Yeah, she's just
overcompensating

176
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,458
because of all the
pressure she's feeling.

177
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,625
[HASHIBA]
You think so?

178
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,083
[KOBAYASHI]
She's taking over in a class

179
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,791
where a murder was committed.

180
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,083
[HOSHINO]
Can you believe our teacher

181
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,750
was put into that crazy shape?

182
00:10:56,833 --> 00:11:00,708
[HASHIBA] I know...
I really liked him, too.

183
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,208
[HOSHINO]
Yeah, so did I. It's a shame.

184
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,083
I-I'm sorry. I gotta go.

185
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,916
[HASHIBA]
Uh, see you tomorrow.

186
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,250
Where exactly is it that
we're going right now?

187
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,500
You'll see. Thanks
for coming with me.

188
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,083
Yeah, no problem.

189
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,583
[KOBAYASHI]
I decided something.

190
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,000
[HASHIBA]
And what's that?

191
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,125
[KOBAYASHI]
I'm going to do it.

192
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,666
[HASHIBA]
Huh? Do what?

193
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,625
[KOBAYASHI]
What do you think?

194
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,166
What he does.

195
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,250
[HOSTESSES chattering]

196
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,333
[KOBAYASHI, HASHIBA panting]

197
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,083
[HASHIBA] They should
fix the freaking elevator.

198
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,166
[yelps]

199
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,666
Mr. Detective, are you in there?

200
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,583
Please open the door!

201
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,041
I can't remember ever seeing him

202
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,125
this interested
in anything before.

203
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,791
Answer me!

204
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,583
Wanna just... go?

205
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,291
[door clicks, creaks]

206
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,375
You shouldn't be here.

207
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,458
But here I am.

208
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,875
[AKECHI] How'd you find
this place, anyway?

209
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,500
I got the idea
at the station.

210
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,958
I saw your call come in on
the detective's cell phone.

211
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,625
I knew that number
belonged to this area.

212
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,833
When I checked, I found out
it was the number for a store

213
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,958
in this neighborhood
that closed a while back.

214
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,166
But when I asked a real
estate agency about it,

215
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,125
they said there was
still an office here.

216
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,333
And here I thought I was clever.

217
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,875
[KOBAYASHI]
It was just a hunch, really.

218
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,125
But as soon as we got here,

219
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,333
I knew this had to
be the right place.

220
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,458
[AKECHI]
That's some hunch.

221
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,083
[HASHIBA]
Kobayashi!

222
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,333
[AKECHI]
So, if I'd used a cell,

223
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,125
you wouldn't have
been able to find me.

224
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,625
Oh, and take your shoes off.

225
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:01,750
[KOBAYASHI]
Do you even have one?

226
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,166
I noticed that you
weren't carrying one

227
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,000
while you were investigating
the crime scene,

228
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,000
so I figured you probably don't.

229
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,791
Aren't you the observant one?

230
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,250
You're right, I'm not
into cell phones.

231
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,375
[HASHIBA] You have a
computer, though, right?

232
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,708
Of course I do, you can't
play SimCity without one.

233
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,166
[HASHIBA gasps]

234
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,958
Oh, wow. Is this the stuff
you use to solve crimes?

235
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,166
[AKECHI]
Don't move anything.

236
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,833
It's all right where
it's supposed to be.

237
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,541
[KOBAYASHI]
I totally get that.

238
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,000
[HASHIBA] It's supposed
to look this way?

239
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,208
I think that's the oldest
couch I've ever seen.

240
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,750
Yeah, well, it belonged
to the previous owner.

241
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,750
It's the only thing he
left behind that I like.

242
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,208
[gasps]

243
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,125
[AKECHI] That's all I've got
to drink-- you're welcome.

244
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,125
If you want something else,

245
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,458
I hope you brought
it with you. Hm?

246
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,208
[AKECHI sighs]

247
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,833
So, uh... "Akechi."
That's your name, right?

248
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,291
You're enrolled at
Kabuki-cho High School.

249
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,875
I checked into you, too.

250
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,625
Come to find out, you're some
kind of an urban legend.

251
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,208
You scored 100% on all
the entrance exams,

252
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,916
but you haven't attended
school even once

253
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,416
since the opening ceremonies.

254
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,458
And yet, you haven't
been expelled.

255
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,958
[AKECHI]
I'm an Agency-authorized

256
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,208
specially designated minor
with an attendance waiver.

257
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,500
What does that mean?

258
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,791
I've basically got permission

259
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,458
from the government
to skip school. See?

260
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,833
But why? Are you
sick or something?

261
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,541
[AKECHI]
Nope, I'm quite healthy.

262
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,166
Oh, then is it, like, some
kind of a mental disorder?

263
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,583
What do you think?!

264
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,166
Uh, no, I guess not.

265
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,541
[AKECHI]
I get special allowances

266
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,375
because I've put my
considerable talents

267
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,166
at the government's disposal.

268
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,250
What talents?

269
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,375
Your skills as a
detective, right?

270
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,250
Right. I'm not too surprised you
haven't heard of the program.

271
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,583
Few people have.

272
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,791
It's just one of many
the government's set up

273
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,625
to attract "gifted youth."

274
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,208
They're not
publicized, of course,

275
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,833
because it's clearly favoritism

276
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,750
and it violates
the Constitution.

277
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,083
But they exist.

278
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,791
They've been recruiting
young talent for decades.

279
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,750
Otherwise those with
special abilities

280
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,208
would remain unutilized.

281
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,458
It's in the national
interest to use us.

282
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,375
At least, that's
a convenient excuse

283
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,250
to justify bending a few rules.

284
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,458
Who am I to argue?

285
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,041
[HASHIBA]
That's ridiculous.

286
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,125
[AKECHI] Amazing how easily
people are conditioned

287
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,541
to ignore the obvious,

288
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,041
even when the truth is staring
them right in the face.

289
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,166
Don't you think,
Young Master Hashiba?

290
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,291
[HASHIBA gasps]

291
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,916
[AKECHI]
I did my own research.

292
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,333
Bright young Souji Hashiba,
heir to the huge conglomerate,

293
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,208
the Hashiba Foundation.

294
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,166
And, once you get
to take over...

295
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,375
[AKECHI] You'll learn quickly
how the world really works,

296
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,791
whether you like it or not.

297
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,458
You'll see.

298
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,958
[HASHIBA]
Yeah, I'll take it over.

299
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,708
But I know I'll never
take part in anything

300
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,458
that's unfair, dishonorable,
or deceptive.

301
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,083
Is that so?

302
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,666
Anyway, it was you over there
who wanted to see me, right?

303
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,916
So, what do you want from me?

304
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,333
One thing, to be your assist--

305
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,250
[AKECHI]
No assistants.

306
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,416
Kobayashi!

307
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,750
[KOBAYASHI]
You wouldn't have to pay me.

308
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,875
[AKECHI]
No volunteers either, okay?

309
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,333
Go home, kid.

310
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,208
[KOBAYASHI]
I can't.

311
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,416
This is the first time
anything's felt fun for me.

312
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,583
No matter what mystery games
I play or books I read,

313
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,625
they don't help. I'm still
bored and unsatisfied.

314
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,291
I feel empty.

315
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,500
But now our
teacher's dead,

316
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:23,250
and it looks like I'm
the primary suspect.

317
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,916
And suddenly, my life
feels really fun!

318
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,375
Kobayashi...

319
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,833
Feels fun, huh?

320
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,541
That's a pretty naïve
point of view.

321
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,208
And you know what they say
about curiosity and the cat.

322
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,041
But if you don't
really feel alive,

323
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,375
what's the point of living?

324
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,416
What're you even saying?

325
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:46,916
[AKECHI]
Hmph.

326
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:55,833
[AKECHI sighs]

327
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,500
[AKECHI]
No matter what I take,

328
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,541
the pain doesn't go away.

329
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,791
[AKECHI sighs]

330
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,250
Otherwise, what's
the point of living?

331
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,333
[AKECHI]
Here's the thing, kid.

332
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,458
They're still extremely
suspicious of you.

333
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,500
[KOBAYASHI]
I don't care about them.

334
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,500
You're convinced
that I didn't

335
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,208
have anything to
do with it, right?

336
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,375
[AKECHI]
Yeah, sure I am.

337
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,916
But it's been a whole week now.

338
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,625
My bet is: the real killer's
about to lose patience

339
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,250
and start looking for attention.

340
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,208
[HASHIBA]
You think so?

341
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,666
[KOBAYASHI]
It does make sense

342
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,333
that they would want to be
acknowledged for their work.

343
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,791
[HASHIBA]
Why?

344
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:54,916
[AKECHI] No murderer would
go through that much trouble

345
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,458
if they weren't trying
to make a point.

346
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,541
They were hoping to create
a spectacle, a show.

347
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,750
The goal was to make
a splashy headline.

348
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:02,791
But that hasn't happened,

349
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,458
so now they're
getting frustrated.

350
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,666
They're pissed that
nobody's talking about it.

351
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,291
[HASHIBA gasps]
You restricted the media!

352
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,833
Damn right, I did.

353
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,083
I made sure the murder didn't

354
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,541
get so much as a
word of coverage.

355
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,541
Your school went right back to
business as usual, too, right?

356
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,250
[HASHIBA] Is that thanks to
your "special arrangement"?

357
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,750
They've given you
quite a lot of power

358
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,000
for your age, haven't they?

359
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,000
No doubt.

360
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,666
You catch on fast, kid.

361
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,625
Still though,
it's not hard to do.

362
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,458
The general public doesn't
pay much attention

363
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,916
to the news to begin with.

364
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,500
Not unless it affects them.
And you can be certain

365
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,875
they won't go out of
their way to seek it out.

366
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,541
It's easier to glide along,

367
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,750
living in a state of
blissful ignorance.

368
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,500
That seems pretty harsh.

369
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,666
[AKECHI]
Passionate type like you

370
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,666
is actually much more rare.

371
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,583
[AKECHI]
Now, don't get me wrong,

372
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,250
I'm no better than
the rest of them.

373
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,583
I don't do this job
for any noble reason.

374
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,375
And I don't care how
gruesomely people die.

375
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,375
[AKECHI] I solve abnormal crimes
for the thrill of the game.

You're disgusting.

Hey, thanks, man.

[AKECHI]
You okay there, kid?

381
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,666
I wanna be like you!

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,958
[gasps]

383
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,041
[AKECHI] Okay. Then let's
play a little game.

384
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,875
If the perpetrator's still
out there, then go find them.

385
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,500
Go solve this case.

386
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,208
Let's see if you can do that.

387
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,708
If you do, then I'll
admit you've got talent.

388
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,625
And your life will
change forever.

389
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,291
The people in charge will
start calling on you.

390
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,875
But who knows?

391
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:34,041
Maybe that'll be just the thing
to cure some of that boredom.

392
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,375
This is crazy.

393
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,041
Kobayashi! This guy's
only gonna get you killed!

394

We're outta here!

thing, though.

396
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,500
Forgot to tell ya.

397
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,333
There's a new arrest warrant
out for you, Kobayashi.

398
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,333
Turns out, your teacher
was a homicidal maniac.

They found some
fascinating new evidence.

You're suspected of
being an accomplice,

No, I emailed them.

have been found on
several murder weapons

recovered from the victim's

The victim's parents' house?

Do you mean... our teacher?

What is that?

This is the scene we came upon

at your murdered

[KAGAMI] It would appear that
your teacher was a killer

425
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,125
long before he was a victim.

426

This is his work.

He was a mass murderer

happened to be into

can't be ignored.
