he usually shut himself up

158
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,125
in the library to avoid others.

Right!

Okay, give it a good pull,
like I explained.

00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:36,958
I'll try.

[AKECHI grunts]

164
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,625

--[grunts]

166

[sighs] Thank you for that.

167
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,958
[NAMIKOSHI] You dislocate
your joints easily,

168
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,875
but you can fight so well.

169
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,041
[AKECHI]
I learn most of the moves

170
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,666
from online karate lessons.

171
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,500
They're good for teaching
someone how to maneuver

172
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,458
their body and keep
up with targets.

173
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,500
But my muscular
strength is lacking.

174
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:05,541
No big deal.
You can lift weights!

175
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,541
I wanna tell you something.

The reason.

183
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:35,416
I finally knew why Akechi
wanted to spend time with me.

184
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,583
I understood why he
would reach out,

185
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:41,125
and why he would risk
so much to protect me.

[KOBAYASHI]
You did?

187
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,833
[NAMIKOSHI] And together,
we had the formula. Our project.

The world would be ours to
mold and shape as we pleased.

as some sort of
hero or something.

291

He was definitely unique.

He was a true prodigy
and a strong fighter.

He was gifted.

However, Akechi was only

take on a risk.

The feeling of control
can be all-consuming.

yourself completely.

so hard for this.

313
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,208
Our formula gives us
all of the power!

314
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,791
This is wrong!

315
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:44,916
[gasps]

316
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,875
[NAMIKOSHI]
He rejected me? Him, too?

317
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,416
Just like everyone
else did. Why?

318
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:56,958
I don't understand why

319
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,750
you're saying things
like that, Akechi.

320
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,625
You know why.

321
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:04,666
Akechi. I'll be a sacrifice.

322
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:10,416
Let me. This proof...
is worth dying over.

323
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,791
This is just the beginning!

324
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:17,291
A failure is a failure!
It's over now!

325
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,208
[NAMIKOSHI] Betrayal. I suddenly
felt an agonizing pain.

326
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:28,375
Heartbreak hurt more than any
beating I had ever received.

327
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,000
So...

328
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,041
[NAMIKOSHI] All right.
Thank you for your help.

329
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,958
I mean that.

330
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:42,708
[NAMIKOSHI] Suddenly,
I had nothing more to lose.

331
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,791
[NAMIKOSHI] I put everything
I had into carrying out my idea.

332
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:53,041
And so, I executed
the formula alone.

333
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,500
A concept developed
from simple mathematics,

334
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,916
became a legend that
spread like a virus.

335
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,416
It grew into a masked
champion who destroys

336
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,916
whatever evil might
exist on this Earth.

337
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,666
What began as an
underground myth

338
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,458
breathes new life as people
take on the identity

339
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,583
in order to pass
anonymous judgment.

340
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:14,208
A symbolic figurehead that
was derived from Dark Star.

341
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,708
They call it...

342
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,750
Oh, I know. It's Twenty Faces.

343
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,500
Was your suicide three years ago

344
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,208
part of the formula?

345
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,958
Yes. Minami's brother
was a stand-in.

346
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,833
He already knew he was dying.

347
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,250
Their help was
predetermined as well.

348
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,583
Afterwards. The story spread.

349
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:38,041
My death was a tragedy to
some and noble to others.

350
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,791
To think that a
junior high student

351
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,666
was responsible for the
Twenty Faces phenomenon.

352
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,541
Your immolation must have
been all over the news.

353
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,250
My photo circulated on the web.

354
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,500
People were finally aware of me.

355
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,333
The formula made it all happen.

356
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,291
[NAMIKOSHI]
You see,

357
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,791
I've been constantly updating
the formula from the start.

358
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,833
The version Akechi
finally deciphered

359
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:03,500
was a few steps behind
my own progression.

360
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,750
The resurgence of
Twenty Faces...

361
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,666
Akechi's splendid work...

362
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,916
It was all foreseen
through my updates.

363
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,541
[KOBAYASHI]
What are you trying to achieve?

364
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,000
You said you originally
wanted to change the world

365
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,250
using your own demon,
but you've been toying

366
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,833
with Akechi for a long time now.

367
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:24,708
I suppose then...
I want Akechi to witness.

368
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:28,291
I need him to know that
the dream we built together,

369
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,791
piece by piece,
was never an illusion.

370
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,750
It has always been
truly possible.

371
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,083
Through the desperate yearnings

372
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,291
of a lonely child,
our friendship began.

373
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,916
If I finish Dark Star, I'll
prove it was all worth it.

374
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,916
Now. Forgive me.

375
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,625
[KOBAYASHI]
I understand.

376
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,208
[KOBAYASHI] In short,
in order to finally bring

377
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:58,458
your plan to fruition, you'll
need to take my life, right?

378
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:04,500
[NAMIKOSHI]
Indeed. Thank you. All of you.

379
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,666
I am so grateful.

380
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,208
Here, with our sacrifices.

381
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:14,000
May we teach this wicked
world to revolutionize.

382
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,083
We will set the example.

383
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:25,250
[NAMIKOSHI] We will light a
dark star in the dark world.

384
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,333
[NAMIKOSHI] Look. It's a
perfect night to die.
