[NAMIKOSHI] I can certainly
sympathize with him.

315
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,833
Most people walk
through life in a daze,

while only a few are awake.
Don't you agree?

317
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,875
Hello, Akechi. Are you
happy to see me?

318
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:03,625
I know how effective the
formula can be on society.

319
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,250
Of course you do.

320
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,458
However, if the creator
has to die in the end,

321
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,833
the formula is defective.

322
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,916
Death is a necessary
element for this rebirth.

323
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,291
All of the pieces
are falling together.

324
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,875
[NAMIKOSHI] In the end, it
doesn't matter which one of us

325
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,958
dies tonight. The remorse
will be devastating,

326
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:30,166
and eventually, you, too, will
become a catalyst for change.

327
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm really sorry that's going
to happen to you, Akechi.

328
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,416
[AKECHI]
Shut up.

Ever since I was little,
I found life to be so boring.

But since I've been

Why did you risk your
life for him back there?

The truth is: I'm heir to
the Hashiba Foundation.

Back in elementary school,

But then, Kobayashi came
into my life one day.

He was nice to me.

Before I knew it,

There were those

but Kobayashi would
always stand up for me.

I've never told him,
but I was so grateful.

I learned what friendship means.

It's being there to love
