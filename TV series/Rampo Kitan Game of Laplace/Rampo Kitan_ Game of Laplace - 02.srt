teacher has been murdered.

To make things worse, the
investigation also revealed

that he was a
serial killer himself,

his bizarre crimes

in his dead parents' garage.

and some other evidence,

[NEWSCASTER 2A]
A junior high school student

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,458
was arrested last night
on charges of mass murder

also the key witness

in a recent teacher murder case,
which you saw here first.

22
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,125
So the question seems to be:

23
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,208
What drives a young
boy to violence?

24
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,833
The problem lies
with the system,

25
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,541
which refuses to address
these kids' issues!

Well, to put it simply, these
young people have "game brain."

They've been completely
desensitized.

Our children are
precious treasures.

The killer wanted the teacher
to die like his victims.

No, I swear, I wasn't.

But on the day the
teacher was murdered,

he'd called me in to see him
and I think the killer knew.

They knew I would be there
alone with the teacher,

for the murder.

Mm...

162
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,500
[KAGAMI] Kobayashi, why did
your teacher call you in?

[POLICE]
Excuse me, sir.

166
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,041
What is it?

167
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,166
[POLICE] A boy claiming to be
the suspect's classmate is here.

168
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,166
He won't leave.

him immediately.

Oh, him.

That kid's the sole heir
to the Hashiba Foundation.

172
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:34,708
Oh? Well, in that case, I guess
we can't just ignore him.

173
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,083

174
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,083
--Hey, you can come in now--

00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:42,791
Relax, kid.

178
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,833
You've seen one too
many bad police movies.

00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,083
No, I'm fine.

Thanks for checking
on me, though.

No problem.

Well, then?

Did you do that thing
that I asked you to do?

184
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,041
Please, try.

185
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,166
Yeah.

186
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,875
And it looks like
your theory was right.

187
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:06,958
The real killer--
They're in our class.

188

I knew it! Thanks for your help.

189
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,625
Now I've got what I need.

190
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,625
Great. Fill me in.

191
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,541
Think you're ready to convince
me of your brilliance now?

192
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,791
Yes!

193
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,875
[KOBAYASHI] The day before
I found the teacher's body,

194
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,291
he called me in for
a meeting via email.

195
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,666
You can check
the email history

196
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,666
on my cell phone to verify.

197
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,291
My grades have never
really been all that bad.

198
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,833
And I've never done anything

199
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,250
that would get me into real
trouble with a teacher, either.

200
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,166
So, why then?

201
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,416
[TEACHER]
Kobayashi.

202
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,458
[KOBAYASHI gasps]

203
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,041
Thanks for coming by.

204
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,750
I'm glad you did.

205
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,000
I've been thinking it over,

206
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,541
and I'm pretty sure I
haven't done anything

207
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,125
that would call for a
meeting with you, sir.

208
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:52,375
So, that means you wanted to see
me for personal reasons, right?

209
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,125
I guess you already know, then.

210
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,333
I'm a little embarrassed.

211
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,791
[KOBAYASHI]
So am I.

212
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,666
I'm so sorry, but I really
can't return your feelings.

213
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,041
[HASHIBA gasps]

214
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,416
Yup.

215
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,000
Turns out, our homeroom
teacher had feelings for me.

216
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,166
If you just stood around
flirting the whole time,

217
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,666
when was this murder supposed
to have been committed?

218
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,083
Right. I'm just imagining
what would've happened

219
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,416
if he had actually been
there for our meeting.

220
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,166
Just imagining?

221
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,625
[KOBAYASHI]
It actually happened like this.

222
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,291
By the time I arrived,

223
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,375
I think he had already
been murdered.

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,666
While I was standing
there in shock,

225
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,083
I believe the killer used
a strong sleeping agent

226
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,375
to knock me out.

227
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,208
After that, the killer hid
the teacher's dead body

228
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,541
behind the desk.

229
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,541
And they stuffed
me into a locker.

230
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,541
Then they waited it out
until the guard walked past.

231
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,916
[footsteps]

232
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,541
Once he'd made his final rounds,

233
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,666
the killer could do anything
they wanted until morning.

234
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,708
[KOBAYASHI] At that point,
they used a saw or something

235
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,375
to dismember the teacher's body

236
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,458
and turn him into
one of the chairs.

237
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,416
During all of that,
I was still sound asleep.

238
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,000
But later, after they were
finished with the teacher,

239
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,416
the killer made sure to put
my fingerprints on the tools

240
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,583
they brought from the garage
in order to frame me.

241
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,833
[HASHIBA] So you think
their plan was to frame you

242
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,000
from the very beginning?

243
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,333
Seems that way.

244
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,250
Your little tryst with
the teacher was a secret.

245
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,541
So, the killer would
have to be someone else.

246
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,583
Someone who could find
out when you'd meet.

247
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,416
[KOBAYASHI]
That's right.

248
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,291
Sure, but--

249
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,958
How'd you figure out who it was?

250
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,166
[KOBAYASHI]
Okay, stay with me here.

251
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,833
[KOBAYASHI] The house is
owned by the teacher's family,

252
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:42,000
but no one lives there now,
so he had total privacy.

253
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,458
But even so, it's strange that
such a long series of crimes

254
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,875
went unnoticed until now.

255
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,208
[HASHIBA]
That's true.

256
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:53,041
I think there's only one
thing that could explain it:

257
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,958
Our teacher and his victims
truly loved each other.

258
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,708
Wha--? No way!

259
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,458
Are you saying--?

260
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,833
Look at them.

261
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,958
They're all so beautiful.

262
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,000
Sure, I'll give you that.

263
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,500
The freak put some
care into his work.

264
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,416
[KOBAYASHI]
He created art with their bodies

265
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
because he was
obsessed with them.

266
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,583
And they cared
about him so much,

267
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,708
they actually
wanted him to do it.

268
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,583
The chairs were so beautiful.

269
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,125
It seemed like proof
that he loved them.

270
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,625
They thought,
"If I can be a chair,

271
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,083
I can be with him forever".

272
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,875
But this time, she made
him into a chair.

273
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,541
Either way, it's just insane!

274
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,916
[KOBAYASHI]
There was a reason the girl

275
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,666
he had gotten involved with
ended up turning on him.

276
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,583
[HASHIBA] So, what? Did she
begin to fear being killed?

277
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:43,208
Mm-mm. It was all
because of jealousy.

278
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,000
Huh?

279
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,041
Jealousy? How do you know?

280
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,750
Because she chose to
frame me for the crime.

281
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:52,208
He'd fallen out of love with
her and in love with me.

282
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,250
[KOBAYASHI] She was
humiliated and heartbroken

283
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,291
because she'd already
decided she wanted him

284
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,541
to turn her into
one of his chairs.

285
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:06,125
But then he left her because
of his feelings for me.

286
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,916
So, basically, I believe the
person who killed our teacher

287
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,833
and pinned the crime
on me was his girlfriend

288
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,541
until right before his death.

289
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,000
All of that might make
sense, theoretically,

290
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,833
but I still haven't
heard you prove that

291
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,833
you're actually innocent, kid.

292
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,083
But if Kobayashi
really is guilty,

293
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,333
then it's pretty strange that
his prints were only found

294
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,791
on the murder weapons and
nowhere else at the scene.

295
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,708
[NAKAMURA]
Well, there's a point.

296
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:28,916
[AKECHI]
If it were me,

297
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,625
I would've made sure
Kobayashi's fingerprints

298
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,375
were all over every
inch of that room,

299
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,666
from baseboards to doorknobs.

300
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,500
She really shouldn't have
half-assed the job like that.

301
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,458
[HASHIBA] Wait a minute,
just whose side are you on?

302
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,125
[AKECHI]
Nobody's.

303
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,250
She had assumed her first
crime would've been enough

304
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,000
to bring all of his
secrets to light.

305
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,333
That was her main goal,

306
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,625
so I don't think she
planned for much after that.

307
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,250
So then when she got
back to the garage...

308
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,916
What? She just panicked?

309
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,291
[KOBAYASHI] No. I think
she'd just reached her limit.

310
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,708
One thing's for sure.

311
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,125
It would've been easy
for a girlfriend

312
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,083
to check the email
history on his cell.

313
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,250
So finding time for the meeting
would've been no problem at all.

314
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:09,166
I imagine she probably had a
duplicate garage key, too, huh?

00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,125
Thanks, Hashiba.

317
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,791
Because of your investigation,
I was able to confirm my theory.

318
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:19,083
Now all we have to do
is catch her in the act.

319
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,083

320

[door rattles]

321
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,166
[KOBAYASHI]
You were worried,

322
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,583
wondering why the
piece of evidence

323
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,041
you thought you took care
of was still here, right?

324
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,750
His cell phone hasn't turned up.

325
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,625
I'm sure that It's still
wherever you stashed it away.

326
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,791
That's not his.

327
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,375
Hashiba planted it
there to draw you out.

328
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,541
You're the real
murderer, aren't you...

329
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,166
...Hoshino?

330
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:08,250
You're the real murderer,
aren't you, Hoshino?

331
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,333
Why are you here, Kobayashi?

332
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,500
Shouldn't you be at home?

333
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,125
I thought something
was wrong with you.

334
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,666
No, I'm fine.

335
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,833
Everything's resolved now.

336
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,333
I see.

337
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,000
[KOBAYASHI] I never realized
how pretty you are, Hoshino,

338
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,666
even though we've
been in the same class

339
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,125
since elementary school.

340
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,791
But I see you differently now.

341
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,333
I can see the real you.

342
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,833
It's as clear as day.

343
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,041
You loved our teacher
very much, didn't you?

344
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,583
Still, though...

345
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,333
I had a feeling about you even
before we set up this trap.

346
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,375
[gasps]

347
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,375
That first day I
came back to school.

348
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,791
You, and only you, said
that our teacher's body

349
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,958
had been put into
a "crazy shape".

350
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,125
[HOSHINO]
Can you believe our teacher

351
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,083
was put into that crazy shape?

352
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,708
The teacher told you that he
was no longer in love with you,

353
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,666
so he had to break it
off, isn't that right?

354
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,333
[HOSHINO] When I could
see that my teacher's eyes

355
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:09,291
followed you every day,
my heart hurt so badly.

356
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,833
I began to obsess.

357
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,583
I hate Kobayashi.

358
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:14,833
I hate him.

359
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,708
I hate him!

360
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,125
You felt that way all this time.

361
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,541
He said since he no
longer loved me the best,

362
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,125
I couldn't be his chair.

363
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,875
He did say he was
really sorry, though.

364
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,583
He was always so
kind and gentle.

365
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:35,208
I was just an ordinary girl
who nobody ever cared about.

366
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,375
I was depressed and
lonely for so long,

367
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,708
I finally decided I
couldn't do it any more,

368
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,708
and I tried to kill myself.

369
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,083
But teacher stopped
me just in time.

370
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,416
He loved me.

371
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,291
[sobs]

372
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,708
He said he'd been watching me.

373
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,125
I might as well have been dead,
but he came into my life

374
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,958
and made me feel like
I really mattered.

375
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,166
I was so happy!

376
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,333
He said I could be his chair
so I could be with him forever!

377
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,666
But then, he took that
dream away from me!

378
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,708
[HOSHINO]
That's why I ended it this way.

379
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,916
It was all I could--

380
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,833
It was the only way
I could make him mine.

381
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,875
[KOBAYASHI]
I get it.

382
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,750
How are you standing there,
all calm and rational?!

383
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,166
Can't you feel? Why aren't
you furious with me?

384
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,750
I framed you for murder!

385
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,291
Why would I be angry?

386
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,833
It's the most fun I've ever had!

387

[HOSHINO gasps]

00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,083
Don'tcha see?

389
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,583
This was my first time
attempting to solve a crime.

390
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:34,083
If you hadn't framed me, I
wouldn't have found my calling!

391
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,416
So... Thank you, Hoshino!

392
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:43,458
[HOSHINO cries]

[KAGAMI]
Kobayashi.

394
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,166
Mr. Kagami!

395
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,500
So does this mean that
we're all done here?

396
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,458
Yeah, as long as she cooperates.

397
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,875
If she tried to deny it now,

398
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,958
it would be a betrayal of
her love for our teacher.

399
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,291
And I don't think
she'd willingly do that.

400
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:01,583
You'll tell the truth from
here on out, right, Hoshino?

401
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:05,750
[HOSHINO] Now I know why he
was so drawn to you, Kobayashi.

402
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,125
He must have sensed
a kindred spirit.

403
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,250
You're really so much alike.

404
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,541
Well, that's not encouraging.

405
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,458
Well then? Is it over?

406
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,291
Yeah, looks like it finally is.

Thanks so much for
all of your help.

408
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,833
I'm sorry that I had to
ask you to put on an act.

409
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,250
I was so glad to help.

410
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,208
But it really blows
my mind that it was her.

411
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,208
I never thought it would
be one of the students.

412
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,083
[HASHIBA]
Yeah.

413
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,916
It makes me wonder about myself.

414
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,875
Am I brave enough
to teach at all?

415
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,958
[HASHIBA gasps]
Well, I believe you are, Miss!

416
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,541
[KAGAMI] Kobayashi,
we owe you an apology.

417
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,291
That was tremendous work today.

418
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,791
Oh, That's okay.

419
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,041
But don't you think it's time

420
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,333
we opened up this chair
to have a look inside?

421
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,083
I mean, it'll
obviously be evidence.

422
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,500
[KAGAMI]
What?

423
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,833
[KOBAYASHI]
It seems to me,

424
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,166
people usually want
their most precious things

425
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,541
kept close to them,
don't you think?

[KAGAMI, NAKAMURA gasp]

[KAGAMI]
Oh my god.

428
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,125
And he called this "love"?

Ooh! What'd you find?

[screams]

431
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,875
[KOBAYASHI] After that,
Ms. Hanabishi wound up

432
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,916
taking a one-month
leave of absence.

433
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,208
[HASHIBA] I heard that
Hoshino officially confessed.

434
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,500
Her punishment will
be severe, won't it?

435
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:32,041
[AKECHI] Not as severe as being
turned into a literal arm chair.

436
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,708
It was you who arranged to have
Kobayashi released right away

437
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,583
when it first happened,
wasn't it, Akechi?

438
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,541
You did it so the real killer
would lose her patience.

439
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,958
[AKECHI]
Ugh, stop talking.

440
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,750
Seems to me Kobayashi was
used, and I don't like it!

441
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,875
Do you think I could
get some quiet, please?

442
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,500
[HASHIBA] I can't even begin to
understand someone like you!

443
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,583
It was Kobayashi who wanted to
solve the case, though, right?

444
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,833
[HASHIBA]
So what?! You put him in danger!

445
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,500
But why are you so upset?

446
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,875
[HASHIBA]
Anybody would be!

447
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:56,875
[KOBAYASHI]
I'm back!

448
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,291
Take your shoes off!

449
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,041
[KOBAYASHI]
I know!

450
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,625
[AKECHI]
Kagami, what do you think?

451
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,041
That garage would've been
discovered eventually, right?

452
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,125
[KAGAMI]
Yeah.

453
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,416
But the way the police operate,

454
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,791
it probably would've
taken a while.

455
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,000
Kobayashi blew us all away.

456
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,583
[HASHIBA]
So you're saying that Kobayashi

457
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,750
would've been released
sooner or later anyway?

458
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,083
[KAGAMI]
I think so.

459
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,666
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure.

460
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,875
He barely managed
to solve the crime.

461
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,875
It only went well because
the murderer gave herself up.

--[phone vibrates, rings]
--[KAGAMI] Uh-oh.

00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,375
It's my little sister.

She's demanding that I come
home to visit her today.

It sounds like you should
probably get going.

00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,125
You understand?

473
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,250
Mr. Kagami actually
seems like a nice guy.

474
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,666
[AKECHI]
Don't be fooled, kid.

475
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,375
It's impossible for
anyone to really know

476
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,583
another person's true nature.

477
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,000
Not that I give a crap.

478
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,416
[KOBAYASHI]
So? So? Did I really do it?

479
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,333
Akechi, did I pass?

480
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,583
[AKECHI sighs]

481
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,583
Yeah, just barely.

482
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Hey, what's that?!

483
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,333
[KOBAYASHI giggling]

484
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,166
All right!

485
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,250
Kobayashi! I think you should
give this some more thought.

486
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,541
[KOBAYASHI] I don't have to
think! This is what I want!

487
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,000
This is who I am!

488
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,166
[gasps]

489
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,166
I feel...

490
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,416
...so alive!
