1
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,666
Contrary to other indications
of a booming economy,

2
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,208
the employment
statistics released

3
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,666
by the government today appear
to indicate a harsh reality.

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,125
The low total employment
rate draws concern.

5
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,458
And it's also spurred
an important discussion:

6
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:33,833
What's the real
difference between

7
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,750
"low total employment"
and "unemployment"?

8
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,291
It can be quite deceptive
because what a low total

9
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,291
employment rate like
this actually indicates

10
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,375
is that many people have given
up looking for work at all.

11
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,916
And those who aren't
actively seeking

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,833
out jobs aren't counted
as being unemployed,

13
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:51,208
so, as a result, the
unemployment rate goes down.

14
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,500
Also--

15
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:53,750
[TWENTY FACES 9A]
Think about it.

16
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,208
The big shots are the
ones who play dirtiest

17
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,958
but their hands always come
out looking squeaky clean!

18
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,125
[MAN A]
Screw the police!

19
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,458
They're nothing but
government lapdogs!

20
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,791
[MAN C] Aren't they
protecting the wrong people?

21
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,250
[WOMAN A]
They hide behind their uniforms!

22
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,875
[TWENTY FACES 9C] Oh, the skull
mask? I got it at the store.

23
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,000
They're literally everywhere.

24
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,000
[HASHIBA]
So, this is the formula

25
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,500
that you and Namikoshi created.

26
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,375
Dark Star.

27
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,125
[AKECHI]
Yeah. And it's intricate.

28
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,875
The formula takes every aspect
of the world into account.

29
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:57,000
[AKECHI] The chain of events
are all specifically laid out.

30
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:01,416
Action A produces result B,
Action B produces result C.

31
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,458
And action C produces result D.

32
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,916
[AKECHI] Thus, from any
given starting point A,

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,291
you can accurately
predict result D.

34
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:18,250
And the process can be repeated
indefinitely into the future.

35
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,041
So in other words,
by using this formula,

36
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,041
you'll know what to do to
get the results you want.

37
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,291
And you should
have the advantage

38
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,916
every step of the way, right?

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,583
[AKECHI]
Yep, that's right.

40
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,458
[HASHIBA]
I can hardly believe it.

41
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,833
[AKECHI] I know. But we
really did achieve it.

42
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,583
Namikoshi. He...

43
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,000
He did this.

44
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,416
He created the current situation
in which Twenty Faces

45
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,750
are generated in large numbers.

46
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,333
[AKECHI]
But he didn't stop there.

47
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,166
He continued to
improve the formula

48
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,875
right up until his death.

49
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:50,375
And so, this version includes
those very last edits.

50
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,375
He's factored in a number
of unknown variables.

51
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,083
But if I can figure out
these parts of the formula

52
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,625
that are new to me,

53
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,000
I should be able to put an end
to the Twenty Faces crimes.

54
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,291
[HASHIBA]
The Twenty Faces crimes

55
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,541
will actually end for good?

56
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,583
You think you can
really do that?

57
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,750
[AKECHI]
I do.

58
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,625
All of the events related
to Twenty Faces

59
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,708
have been happening
according to this formula.

60
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,833
Once I figure out all of
the missing variables

61
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,041
and plug them in,

62
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,208
it'll be possible to
predict future crimes.

63
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,583
I can prevent them before
they even happen.

64
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:24,708
I'll be able to put an end to
the Twenty Faces domino effect.

65
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,666
Why did it fail?

66
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,708
Every time a new
Twenty Faces appears,

67
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,583
I input the data from the case.

68
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:35,625
Then I try to work backwards,
reconstruct the formula.

69
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,291
But it's become pretty clear

70
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,041
I don't get Namikoshi's
thought process.

71
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,208
I don't think it's really
possible for anyone

72
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,541
to completely understand
another person.

So, there's a formula

76
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,958
that even you can't figure out.

77
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,625
That sounds interesting.

want me to get involved

with Namikoshi?

volunteering me?

Suit yourself.

[KOBAYASHI]
Sure!

There's a lot of "ifs" and
"thens" to sort through,

but once you know
what to look for,

00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,500
But you have to take
better care of yourself!

160

The way you're both acting,

166
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,916
it's more confounding
than the formula!

[AKECHI] I have no choice.
I have to stop Twenty Faces.

[HASHIBA]
Yeah, but--

170
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,666
[KOBAYASHI]
I think the problem is

171
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,791
you're actually forgetting
to think about yourself.

172
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,458
Oh, that's great.

Now you're harping on me, too?

00:08:58,666 --> 00:08:59,958
[KOBAYASHI]
No.

175
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,375
This formula factors
in all sorts of events

176
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,333
to make its calculations, right?

177
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,291
But until now, it
hadn't occurred to me

178
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,833
to factor in your
potential actions.

[AKECHI gasping]

180
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,875
Hey. You okay?

181
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,666
[KOBAYASHI]
Today I started thinking about

182
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,083
how you're mentioned so often

183
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,208
among Twenty Faces'
online followers.

184
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,916
Your existence obviously
affects his actions.

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,791
Then again, when you
really think about it,

186
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,041
how could it not?

187
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,458
You were also undoubtedly
the person closest

188
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,125
to Namikoshi when he was
working on the formula.

189
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,750
I'm sure there was
never a moment

190
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:41,083
he wasn't conscious of
you in every respect.

191
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,000
So, really, it's only natural

192
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,250
that he would factor your
actions into the formula.

193
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,833
Think about it.

194
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,083
What's the most important piece
of the puzzle at this moment?

195
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,958
It's you. It all hangs
on what you do next.

196
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,833
It doesn't surprise me, though.

197
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,583
It's just like you to exclude
yourself from a formula

198
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,583
which is meant to represent
the whole world.

According to the formula,
we're waiting for a phone call

Hello, Akechi.

This is Twenty Faces.

war on Akechi.

It was online.

As long as Akechi exists,

00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,291
it will force them
to think twice

before committing to be
the next Twenty Faces.

244

But Successor's goal is to
generate more copycats.

245
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,208
That means, they'll
have to defeat Akechi,

and demonstrate that he's
powerless to stop them.

00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,833
She found out that uncontrolled
dura mater obtained through

318
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,875
illegal channels was used
for several surgeries.

319
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,333
This dura mater was also
used in the surgery

320
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,916
Dr. Munakata performed on me.

321
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,833
It was the source
of the infection

322
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,583
that was slowly killing me.

323
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,541
[MUNAKATA]
That's a false accusation.

324
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,666
The data you found is
a recording error.

325
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,541
It's as simple as that.

326
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:16,041
[BROTHER]
My medical record, the evidence.

327
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,791
Everything conclusive was
quickly and conveniently

328
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,000
swept under the rug.

329
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,833
[BROTHER]
Oh, sis. Please don't cry.

330
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:33,250
And that's... that's why I...

331
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,416
[BROTHER]
I wish...

332
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,666
[DOCTOR C]
Oh, boy.

333
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,791
[DOCTOR D]
Is that really true?

334
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,666
[MUNAKATA]
No! This is a horrible lie!

335
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,000
I swear, someone's
trying to frame me!

336
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,500
[SISTER]
Oh, it's true!

337
00:16:56,583 --> 00:17:00,000
And I should know, because
that boy was my little brother!

338
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,750
[CROWD gasps]

339
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,416
[ALL gasp]

340
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,375
[SISTER]
You ready?

341
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,708
Meet this week's Twenty Faces.

342
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:12,083
Surprise, it's me!

343
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,000
[ALTERED VOICE] We've been right
beside you for quite some time,

344
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,083
but you never see.

345
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:18,875
[SISTER]
Yeah!

346
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:19,916
Wait. Aren't you the...?

347
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,416
[MINAMI]
I'm Medical Examiner Minami!

348
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,125
And this is
Three-Minute Shocking!

349
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,458
Today's menu is...

350
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,833
This!

351
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,500
The same stuff that was used
for my brother's surgery

352
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,583
is in the food that you were
served for lunch today!

353
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,125
Was it super tasty?
I sure hope so!

354
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,916
[gasps]

355
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,250
[MINAMI] Of course, you're
a smarty pants doctor.

356
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,041
So, you already know
that stuff's dangerous

357
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,500
even when ingested orally!

358
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,416
[DOCTOR A]
Wait, that's not true, is it?

359
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,916
[DOCTOR AA screams]
I ate it, I ate it!

360
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,250
[MUNAKATA]
This is unbelievable!

361
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,208
I'm a genius!

362
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,541
You're depriving future mankind

363
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,208
of countless contributions
to the field!

364
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,500
This is a desecration of
modern medical science!

365
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,333
[MINAMI]
Punishment Punch!

366
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,750
[MUNAKATA groans]

367
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,833
[MINAMI] Oh doc, you truly
are pathetic, aren't you?

368
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,541
You did this exact same
thing to your patients,

369
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,791
but turn the tables
and you fall to pieces.

370
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,208
[MUNAKATA] I've got to
go test for infection!

371
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,666
[AKECHI]
That won't be necessary.

372
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,875
[MINAMI. MANAKATA gasp]

373
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,208
[REPORTER 9B] So that woman
is Twenty Faces this time?

374
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,250
[MINAMI laughs]

375
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,375
You're way too late, Akechi!

376
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,833
You didn't get
here fast enough!

377
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,791
Looks like the damage
has already been done!

378
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,958
'Fraid not. You haven't been
able to do a damn thing.

379
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,291
[MINAMI]
Huh?

380
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,458
[AKECHI] They didn't
eat any of it, Minami.

381
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,458
I had all the food in
this hall replaced

382
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,458
with safe food well beforehand.

383
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,500
[MINAMI growls]

384
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,958
The police have
already surrounded

385
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,083
the conference room
and the building.

386
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,416
Looks like you won't be
doing any damage at all.

387
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,916
You'll be arrested before
you have a chance.

388
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,208
It's a definitive defeat.

389
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,750
[MINAMI] I see. So, you've
finally figured it out, then.

390
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,041
I mean Dark Star, of course.

391
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,250
That's right.

392
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,375
This is the end of Twenty Faces.

393
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,583
Once and for all.

394
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:07,500
[MINAMI laughs]

395
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,083
What's funny?

396
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,291
[MINAMI] I already knew this
was going to happen, you idiot.

397
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,708
[AKECHI]
What?

398
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,625
[CROWD murmurs]

399
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,416
[SKULL MAN] You're really
here, aren't you...

400
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,625
Akechi?

401
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,875
[AKECHI gasps]

402
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,833
[REPORTER C]
Another Twenty Faces?

403
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,583
[REPORTER D]
Is that Southern Terrace?

404
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:36,125
[MINAMI laughs]
The media rushing in here

405
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,625
and my defeat are only
part of the larger plan!

406
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,541
Every bit of this is
in the chain of events

407
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,916
that the formula predicts!

408
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,708
Akechi, hold on!

409
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,458
[AKECHI panting]

410
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,458
[panting] You killed him!

411
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,750
[SKULL MAN]
It was an accident.

412
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:48,125
[CROWD screaming]

413
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,333
[DOCTOR AA]
Mr. Munakata!

414
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,041
[SKULL MAN]
The world we live in is a dream.

415
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,333
The dream we have at
night is the true world.

416
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,333
Namikoshi.

417
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,125
[REPORTER 9A]
What? Namikoshi?

418
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,500
[REPORTER 9C]
It must be make-up, right?

419
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,458
[REPORTER 9D] I thought
he was burned to death!

420
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,333
[MAN 9C]
What's this?

421
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,583
[POLICE OFFICER A]
What's going on?

422
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,000
[MINAMI laughs]
All of this happened

423
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:22,083
only to herald his
miraculous return to us!

424
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,416
Twenty Faces isn't
some cult myth.

425
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,250
It's our reality.
