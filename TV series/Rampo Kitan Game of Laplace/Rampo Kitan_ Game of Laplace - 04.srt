When the law does not act
against those who rape and kill,

I act. With my own hands.

investigating these
horrible crimes.

You're just a middle

You should spend your
free time reading books,

That's Twenty Faces, isn't it?

everyone was talking
about three years ago?

Yes, but-- I mean,
yes, and I, too,

remember all the buzz
surrounding this person.

42
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,000
It affected our

Three years... Huh.

44
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,416
[KOBAYASHI] He was a vigilante
from what I remember.

45
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,583
He killed other criminals who
were released on technicalities.

46
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:49,875
Some people even started

47
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,041
thinking of him
as a hero, right?

48
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,666
I hear that there
have even been some

copycat killings
from time to time.

50
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,583
Whenever a copycat appears,

the government
enacts media controls.

But there's too much information
online, can't block everything.

free to kill again.

[KAGAMI] True, but the one
thing working in our favor

110
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,375
with the Current Twenty
Faces is that he always

111
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,916
uploads a video before
and after each kill.

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,791
So he gives us a heads up
on who he's going to kill,

113
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,750
and if he does do it,
he tells us afterwards

114
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,166
where and how it went down.

[TWENTY FACES]
The next person I will punish

122
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,833
is a man who six years ago
set fire to his own home,

123
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,375
killing his parents
and siblings.

124
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,208
At the time, he was
still barely a minor,

125
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,750
so the court sent him
to a juvenile facility.

126
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,708
But they released him
back out onto the streets.

127
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,041
He promptly killed
several more people.

Now a full-fledged adult,

129
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,625
he avoided prison again by
pretending to be schizophrenic.

The government dropped
all criminal charges.

He had grown so cocky

132
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,708
that he even began bragging
to those around him that

133
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,458
it was okay for him to kill

134
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,625
because he belonged
to a privileged class.

avoided punishment for too long.

jury, and executioner.

where he kills his victims

in the same manner
they killed theirs.

the same manner?

Well, for starters, there's
the victim he dismembered.

to his own victims.

to destroy evidence?

00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,416
were just copycats.

Yeah, this is him.

00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,125
Yes.

164
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,166
Yes. Okay. Got it, thanks.

165
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,208
Sorry. I had to take that.

166
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,625
If something new comes up,
I'll let you know right away.

168
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,083
Mister Kagami,
are you all right?

169
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,750
[KAGAMI]
Yeah. Thanks.

170
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,125
You need some rest.

171
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,458
[KAGAMI]
It's hard.

172
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,875
Between my normal caseload
and now Twenty Faces,

173
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,750
I got a lot on my plate.

174
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,000
Our top story tonight,
Twenty Faces.

175
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,291
The web-savvy spree killer

176
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,333
is now linked to
over a dozen murders.

177
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,791
With the country on
the verge of panic,

178
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,541
authorities are urgently
putting together

179
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,541
a profile on the killer.

180
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,125
Over the last week,
he's posted videos online,

181
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,750
before and after each
of his fifteen kills.

182
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:04,041
In these, he mentions his
victims' own criminal histories.

183
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,583
[KOBAYASHI]
Hey, um, Akechi?

184
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,666
Do you have a link to Twenty
Faces you haven't told me about?

185
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,583
[AKECHI]
What makes you think that?

186
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,083
Your attitude towards this case

187
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,291
seems a little different
compared to the previous cases.

188
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:22,000
[AKECHI sighs] What a pain.
But I guess I'll use her.

189
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,166
Hey there, Kagami. You
working late again tonight?

190
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,666
Huh? Oh, yeah. This damn
Twenty Faces case.

191
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,958
[NAKAMURA]
Right. The latest nut job.

192
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,500
Isn't Akechi helping
us with that one, too?

193
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,916
Just let him solve it

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,583
so you can get outta here
at a normal time for once.

195
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,791
We can't depend on a teenager
to do everything for us.

196
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,125
We work for the people.

197
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,916
Solving crimes is our job.

198
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,666
[sighs] You get too
wrapped up in your work.

199
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,291
You gotta at least take breaks,

200
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,625
especially working
cases like this.

201
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:05,500
All right. I've said my
piece. I'll leave you be.

202
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,875
Wait.

Oh, yeah? 'Kay.

204
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,875
How 'bout... we go
for a quick drink?

205
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,416
[KAGAMI]
Yeah... Let's go.

206

--[NAKAMURA] What?
--[KAGAMI] It'll be good.

207

You mean it? Great!

Where the heck are we?

210
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,708
In the basement of the
Shinjuku main office.

211
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,250
Down here are the
cells they reserve

212
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,666
for a special class of criminal.

213
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,666
It's unofficial name
is Shinjuku Prison.

214
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,875
Wow. Then the guy we're going to
see must be really interesting!

215
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,458
Well, first, it's not a guy.

216
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,166

definition of interesting.

[HASHIBA] Okay, what is
wrong with this woman?

230

You came all the way down here

231
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,375
because you couldn't
be without me, right?

I know you've longed for me.

Why would I ever long for you?

The only way I want
to see you is dead.

235

might make me... spring a leak.

you know who we are?

lacked the evidence

Talk about a
miscarriage of justice!

around a strong man who will
install cameras in public.

nothing more than

don't protect the weak,

00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,625
[HASHIBA] What do you think
Twenty Faces hopes to gain

316
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:22,000
by putting up these videos
before each one of his attacks?

317
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,875
It seems like they only
put him in more danger.

318
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:40,208
I hear our favorite vigilante's
posted a new video.

319
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,250
[KAGAMI]
Yeah. Looks like it.

320
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:16,791
[sighs] This headache sucks.

321
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,166
There are so many
bad guys out there.

322
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,625
[MAN A] Oh! Hey, buddy,
haven't seen you in a while.

323
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,583
[WATANUKI]
Oh, yeah, hey.

324
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,791
Come in and see the
new batch of girls.

325
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,000
Couple of 'em are
even junior high age!

326
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah, that sounds okay...

327
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,791
They look real young.

328
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,583
I think elementary school
girls would be better.

329
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,458
Hey, we have them, too!

330
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,083
Heh, then I know where
I'm gonna be tonight!

331
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,958
I'll make sure you get one of
our cleanest booths, nice and...

332
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,750
[WATANUKI groans]

333
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,208
[WATANUKI]
What's all this about?

334
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,625
Where the heck am I?

335
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,708
Huh? [grunts]

336
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,458
C'mon, dude, this isn't funny.

337
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,500
You're-- You're...

338
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,791
...that Internet guy!

339
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,583
You're Twenty Faces!

340
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,625
[WATANUKI]
No! No!

341
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,750
Ow, let go! Let go of me!

342
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:40,958
Help!

343
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,125
Why me?!

344
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,625
Stop it!

345
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,250
No! Help!

346
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,291
I didn't do anything wrong!

347
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,875
[screams]

348
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,666
[AKECHI]
Didn't your mother ever tell you

349
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,500
two wrongs don't make
a right, Twenty Faces?

350
00:17:56,583 --> 00:18:00,000
[WATANUKI sobbing]

351
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,875
[AKECHI]
Although to be honest with you,

352
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,041
if that creep died,
I wouldn't be too broken up.

353
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,791
--[TWENTY FACES groans]
--[WATANUKI screams]

354
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,000
[WATANUKI pants, groans]

355
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,750
[AKECHI] Don't worry
about him getting away.

356
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:17,833
He's under surveillance.

357
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,083
He'll be apprehended
immediately.

358
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,208
[AKECHI] I knew once we put
Watanuki back on the street,

359
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,625
you couldn't resist
hunting him down.

360
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,333
I kept wondering why
you'd put up those videos.

361
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,458
Especially if they just
increase the chances

362
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,333
of the police apprehending you.

363
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,500
[TWENTY FACES]
I am Twenty Faces.

364
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,750
And any criminal who has not
been punished for his crime...

365
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,750
...should fear my name.

366
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,875
[KOBAYASHI] Narcissism? No,
it's not for shallow reasons.

367
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,416
It's so you can be a boogeyman,

368
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,750
a deterrent to all the other
rapists and murders out there.

369
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:59,583
A vigilante who kills those who
escaped the reach of justice.

370
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:03,125
The very fear of you could
stop crimes from taking place.

371
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,375
That's why.

372
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,416
A frustrated police
force announced today

373
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,833
that a lack of evidence in
the serial kidnapping case

374
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,708
meant releasing the suspect.

375
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,833
Since Watanuki's release led
to such outrage in society,

376
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:17,500
you felt compelled to punish
him as soon as possible.

377
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,458
Had you delayed in finding him,
he would have used that time

378
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,916
to kidnap and kill
more young girls.

379
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,750
And in turn, other
criminals would begin

380
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,416
losing their fear
of Twenty Faces.

381
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,208
Their fear is crucial.
If the streets have no fear,

382
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,583
then Twenty Faces is not
a deterrent to crime.

383
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,541
You realize how
this boxes you in,

384
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,916
so that's why as soon
as he was released...

385
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:41,708
You came after him,

386
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,291
even though you're
clearly smart enough

387
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:47,375
to have put together that
his release was to trap you.

388
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,833
And now, all that's
left is the end game.

389
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,541
[AKECHI]
Easy way? Or hard way?

390
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,041
[gun cocks]

391
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,541
I talked to Nakamura.

392
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,291
I had him replace your
ammo with dummy rounds.

393
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,583
[TWENTY FACES gasps]

394
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:37,625
But just as I thought,
it wasn't necessary.

395
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,166
You couldn't point that pistol
at me and pull the trigger.

396
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,208
You don't kill the innocent.

397
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,333
[TWENTY FACES]
Right.

398
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,500
I kill only those who have
committed violent crimes

399
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,041
and escaped society's justice.

400
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,541
[TWENTY FACES]
I... I have to know.

401
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,250
How'd you figure out it was me?

402
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,583
It wasn't hard because you
weren't trying hard to hide it.

403
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,041
Shoes gave you away.

404
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,833
They were still covered
in the plaster mix

405
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,875
you'd used to display
that one batch of victims.

406
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,083
[TWENTY FACES sighs] I was so
caught up in the big picture.

407
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,791
I started getting sloppy
with the little things.

408
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,375
[TWENTY FACES]
Or maybe it was more like...

409
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,750
I lost sight of everything,
a long time ago.

410
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,750
What was it that drove you
to become Twenty Faces...

411
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,625
...Kagami?
