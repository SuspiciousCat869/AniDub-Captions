1
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,375
Oh! My goodness, it's an elf!

2
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,583
Mia.

3
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:35,708
Pretty.

4
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:40,833
[MIZE coughs]

5
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:44,208
We need to get him some help,
or he's not going to make it!

6
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,375
Stay with him.

7
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:48,208
I'll be back as quickly
as I possibly can!

8
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,250
It's too dangerous
to go out at night alone.

9
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,833
Let me go with you!

10
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,375
[ARISA]
Awww!

11
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,708
You snuck off to a brothel
in the middle of the night?

12
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,291
Nasty!

13
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,750
Why would you pay for services I
would gladly give you for free?

14
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,416
I am deeply offended, Master!

15
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,208
Not cool.

16
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,958
[ARISA]
I smell boy!

17
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,208
[SATOU]
She's insane.

18
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:47,458
Ahh... It smells like dog.

19
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,666
Tell the truth.

20
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,125
Where else did you go?

21
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:50,875
Hmph!

22
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:51,958
Last night,

23
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,833
when I went to
get medicine for Lulu.

24
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,083
I saved the life of
a wererat knight.

25
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,250
[groans]
Was it a girl knight?

26
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,500
Actually, no.

27
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,708
If you really wanna know,
it was an old man.

28
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:02,916
Oh dear!

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,500
It's boy love?

30
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,750
You were doing god-knows-what in
the forest with a filthy animal!

31
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,000
Probably rolling in the mud

32
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,375
with a big hunk
of man-beast flesh!

33
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,000
Ooo!

34
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,166
That sounds fun!

35
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,125
[SATOU] Could you
stop spouting nonsense?

36
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:15,958
Get dressed.

37
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,458
That's an order.

38
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,708
Huh?

39
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,916
[SATOU]
Oh. How are you?

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,208
Good.

41
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,875
I feel better than
yesterday, that's for sure.

42
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,583
I bought you some meds.

43
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,166
You'll be feeling
better in no time.

44
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,666
Oh. You're very kind, Master.

45
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,333
[SATOU] After everyone
finishes breakfast,

46
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,666
I should probably head
to the General Store.

47
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:40,916
Morning, Nadi.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,375
How are they doing?

49
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,458
Well.

50
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,500
At the moment,
they're still sleeping.

51
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,833
Mia doesn't appear to be
injured, but she needs her rest.

52
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:52,000
The poor thing was on
the verge of exhaustion.

53
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,333
According to the manager,

54
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,250
Mia is exhibiting
classic symptoms

55
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,375
of prolonged MP deprivation.

56
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,916
[SATOU]
Hmm...

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,708
[NADI] The manager tried
multiple forms of magic on her.

58
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,916
He tried Mana Transfer,
a practical magic.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,375
And he tried Stamina Charge,
a Forest Magic.

60
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,541
But nothing worked.

61
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,791
[SATOU]
Judging from her titles,

62
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,166
I'd say she's probably
about 11 years old.

63
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,916
She's not cursed or sick.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,083
And it seems like her MP is
recovering, slowly but surely.

65
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,125
There's only one way to
speed up the process, Satou.

66
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,625
A mana potion.

67
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,583
But those tonics aren't cheap.

68
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,666
We could take her to
a place rich with mana,

69
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,458
like a ley line intersection
or a good mana source.

70
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,541
Huh? Mana source?

71
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes. But around these parts,

72
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,583
our options are a bit scarce.

73
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:41,333
There's only the Count's castle
and the Valley of the Dragons.

74
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,666
[gasps]

75
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,458
I just heard some
movement upstairs.

76
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,916
I think your guests are awake.

77
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,791
[NADI]
Mia. Are you feeling okay?

78
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:01,958
Yes.

79
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,958
[NADI]
My name is Nadi and I work here.

80
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:07,625
Another elf, Yusaratoya,
owns this place, though.

81
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,458
Yuya?

82
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,041
Man.

83
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,125
There.

84
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,708
[NADI]
Oh! That's Satou!

85
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,875
He saved your life, Mia, you and
your friend with the red helmet.

86
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,333
Satou?

87
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,583
[NADI]
Is it all right if he comes in?

88
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,125
Yes.

89
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:25,916
[SATOU]
Hi, there.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,416
I'm Satou, a merchant.

91
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,916
It's nice to meet you.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,666
[MIA]
A Spirit User?

93
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,916
No.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,625
I don't think I've ever
used a spirit before.

95
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,958
[MIA]
Can't see them?

96
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,083
Are those something
people can see?

97
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,166
[NADI]
Yes.

98
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,666
But spirits are
only visible to people

99
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,583
who have the
gift of Spirit Sight.

100
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,083
[SATOU]
That's awesome.

101
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,833
I guess Spirit Sight
is rare, even for an elf.

102
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,583
Are you hungry, Mia?

103
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,916
[MIA]
Yes.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,458
[NADI] I'll go whip up
something in the kitchen,

105
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,958
maybe some hot wheat porridge.

106
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,875
Satou, would you mind looking
after her while I'm gone?

107
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,458
[SATOU]
Not at all.

108
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:05,541
So about these spirits,
what are they like?

109
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,750
Fluffy.

110
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,666
[SATOU]
Uh... Fluffy?

111
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,458
Yes. Sparkly.

112
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,708
[SATOU]
Eh, sparkly?

113
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,791
She's not exactly a talker.

114
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,958
I need to figure out a way to
get her to open up a little bit.

115
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,333
Wait! I know!

116
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,625
So,

117
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,958
Mia, how do you say,
"Good morning," in elvish?

118
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,583
Teparusa.

119
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,250
[SATOU]
It was like pulling teeth,

120
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,666
but I did manage to
pry some info out of her.

121
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,250
Apparently, spirits flow

122
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,208
along the ley lines
subsisting on mana.

123
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,958
Sorry for sticking
around so long.

124
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,541
I should probably get going.

125
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,250
Stay.

126
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,333
[ARISA]
All right!

127
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,291
Victory is mine!

128
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,291
Ahhh!

129
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,375
Aww, man!
Arisa wins every time!

130
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,666
Pochi, Tama, if the two
of you have time to sulk,

131
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,583
then you most certainly
have time to get better!

132
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,041
Arisa's really smart!

133
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,125
Hey, wait.

134
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,041
The cards from yesterday.

135
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,458
Look, you guys: it's Master!

136
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,833
Having fun, girls?

137
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,833
[TAMA]
We learned some words!

138
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:21,958
Pretty cool, huh?

139
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,958
Yeah. Cool!

140
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,666
So cool!

141
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,541
Quiz time.

142
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,458
What's this card say?

143
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,208
[POCHI]
That one says, "Meat"!

144
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,208
[SATOU]
Nope.

145
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,833
Goat.

146
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:36,750
And this one?

147
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,291
Also meat!

148
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,666
[SATOU]
Sorry. Rabbit.

149
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,375
Hmm...

150
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,791
Yes, well.

151
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,666
Technically, they're
not wrong, Master.

152
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,583
All animals are meat in a
certain sense of the word.

153
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,541
I suppose you're
right about that.

154
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,583
But the answer is not meat.

155
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,500
To get it right, you have
to name the actual animal.

156
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,708
I understand!

157
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,500
This meat is a goat, right?

158
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,625
Yeah.

159
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,208
And this meat is a
bouncy bunny rabbit!

160
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,666
Then my card does
not mean poultry,

161
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,500
but rather the
very chicken itself!

162
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,666
[SATOU]
Huh?

163
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,541
[POCHI] How do you
write "meat," Master?

164
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,791
[SATOU]
Like this.

165
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,125
[MARTHA] Yuni! I've been
looking everywhere for you!

166
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,916
I'm sorry about that, Martha.

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,750
You still behave like a
little kid, do you know that?

168
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,375
Come. We need to get to work.

169
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,875
We have to clean up the stables

170
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,375
and replace the hay
before it's time for lunch!

171
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,291
But, Martha,
I already did all that.

172
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,708
Huh?

173
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,916
Pochi and Tama helped me
finish my chores this morning.

174
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,833
That's right!

175
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,375
We were some cleaning fools!

176
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,541
I picked up the horse poo!

177
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,375
Wow, girls.

178
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,291
I'm impressed.

179
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,875
Yeah, we know!

180
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,708
[LIZA] A princess, under
the protection of a wererat?

181
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,958
Oh, Master!
I wanna meet her!

182
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,708
[TAMA] I've never heard of
a wererat princess before.

183
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,000
[POCHI]
Yeah, me neither!

184
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,291
How fun!

185
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,875
Well.

186
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,208
After we finish eating lunch,
let's all go say, "Hello," then.

187
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,583
Sounds like fun.

188
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,583
I'm in!

189
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,666
All righty!

190
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,333
Okie-dokey-smokey!

191
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,041
I'm so excited to meet her!

192
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,000
[TAMA] Aww, I wish
we could go right now!

193
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,416
[SATOU]
How about it, Lulu?

194
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,916
You feeling up to it?

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,333
We'd love for you to come.

196
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,791
'Kay.

197
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,666
[ARISA]
I'll go first!

198
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,375
Hello, my name is Arisa!

199
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,541
My name is Pochi!

200
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,208
I'm Tama.

201
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,500
Mia.

202
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,416
Oh!

203
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,916
Wow, she's a pretty princess!

204
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,916
I love her hair so much!

205
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,250
[ARISA]
Master!

206
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,416
I don't understand;
you said she was a rat girl!

207
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,583
No, I didn't.

208
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,791
I said she was a princess

209
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,416
who was being guarded
by a wererat knight.

210
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,416
--[TAMA] Mia!
--[ARISA] Mia!

211
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,416
[POCHI]
It's nice to meet you!

212
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,958
[ARISA]
Look at your hair!

213
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,916
So plush!

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,875
[TAMA]
Can I touch it?

215
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,666
I'm gonna head downstairs.

216
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,541
Look after Mia, for me, 'kay?

217
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,625
Okay!

218
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,041
Okie-doke, Master!

219
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,333
We really like Mia!

220
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,375
Stay.

221
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,250
[SATOU] Jeez. I wonder
what's got her so attached.

222
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,500
[NADI]
What a relief.

223
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:14,500
All I had for breakfast today
was some wheat porridge.

224
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,500
Thanks a lot.

225
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,166
Remind me, Satou.

226
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,708
You're a merchant, aren't you?

227
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,916
Uh. Yeah.

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,375
I mean, I guess.

229
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,916
I haven't exactly
been selling my wares.

230
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Why don't you have a cart, then?

231
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:32,916
[SATOU]
Well.

232
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I had a horse carrying my stuff.

233
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,541
But sadly, when the starfall hit
it got spooked and ran away.

234
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,375
[NADI]
I'm sorry to hear that.

235
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,875
You know.

236
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,041
If you can afford it, you
should probably purchase one.

237
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,791
I would buy a drawn cart.

238
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,458
[SATOU]
A drawn cart?

239
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,416
The manager is friendly
with an older merchant

240
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,625
who is planning to
retire from business soon.

241
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,125
If you have any interest,

242
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,625
he's going to be selling two
horses and a cart as well.

243
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,041
[SATOU]
Hmm...

244
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,291
I really appreciate
the offer, Nadi.

245
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,416
But I don't know how
to drive one of those.

246
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,000
Uh. I um...

247
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,041
[SATOU]
Lulu.

248
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,250
There's no need to be shy, okay?

249
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,375
[LULU]
Yes.

250
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,833
Master,

251
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,958
I just wanted to tell you
that I have some experience

252
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,458
driving a one-horse cart.

253
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,291
[SATOU]
Awesome.

254
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,333
Maybe you can teach me then.

255
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,458
Huh?

256
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,750
[SATOU]
Nadi.

257
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,625
Tell the manager's contact
I'm very interested.

258
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,500
That was a snap decision.

259
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,833
Don't you want to know
about the price, Satou?

260
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,000
[SATOU]
Oh, yeah, the price.

261
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,375
Not bad.

262
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,666
I think I'll buy one after all.

263
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,125
Here take this.

264
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,541
Let's just say this is as
much as I'm willing to pay.

265
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,916
Whatever's left over, you can
keep as a "thank you" tip.

266
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,291
Oh my.

267
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,208
[SATOU] That was probably a
little too generous on my part.

268
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,166
I'm a terrible merchant.

269
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,000
This is a perfect spot
for camping lessons,

270
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,458
don't you think, girls?

271
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,875
--[TAMA] Yeah!
--[POCHI] Okie-dokeies!

272
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,541
[TAMA]
You want us to weed?

273
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,875
[POCHI]
Don't worry! We got this!

274
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:21,916
Look how strong I am!

275
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,750
[TAMA]
This is really heavy.

276
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,125
Check it out, girls!

277
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,750
We're all stocked up!

278
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,250
Try a kettle!

279
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,541
[POCHI]
It's weird, right?

280
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,875
[TAMA]
Yeah.

281
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,625
The kettle's really mad at us!

282
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,250
He's about to blow his top!

283
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,625
The kettle man is super scary!

284
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,291
[SATOU]
The kettle man?

285
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,666
Relax.

286
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,083
It's nothing.

287
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,833
Just a whistle to let you
know the water is boiling.

288
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,333
He seems pretty mad.

289
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,291
How come he doesn't just say,
"Hey, I'm about to boil"?

290
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,083
[SATOU]
It's not a "he." It's an "it."

291
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,625
The water gets so hot
in there it turns to vapor.

292
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,208
[ARISA] What are you, some
kind of science teacher nerd?

293
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,458
They're just kids.

294
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,958
You can't possibly
expect them to understand

295
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,333
that water gets one thousand
times bigger when it boils.

296
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,208
[SATOU] Don't you mean sixteen
hundred times bigger, Arisa?

297
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,416
[ARISA]
Look girls.

298
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,041
Water turns into a
white smoke called steam,

299
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,166
but only when it
gets really hot.

300
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,500
The hotter it gets,
the stronger the steam.

301
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,375
That's what causes
the lid to move like that.

302
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,291
Look.

303
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,458
Just like you create force
when you blow out air,

304
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,833
the water creates force when
it turns to steam and rises up!

305
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,291
She's so awesome!

306
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,666
You're a genius, Arisa!

307
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,250
[POCHI]
Tama! Do the rolly-roll!

308
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,416
[TAMA]
It's rolly-roll-time!

309
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,666
Tama! Way to go!

310
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,416
[POCHI] You're quite
the rolly-roller, Tama!

311
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,166
[TAMA]
Your turn, Pochi!

312
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,833
[SATOU]
Aren't they...?

313
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,916
[DEMI-HUMAN A] This is for
the grill chicken you gave us.

314
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,625
You were kind. Thank you.

315
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,791
It was very yummy, too.

316
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:32,666
[SATOU]
What's this?

317
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,208
Present for you! Fresh fruit!

318
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,833
[TAMA]
What are you guys doing?

319
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,500
[POCHI] You guys get away
from our master right now!

320
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,833
Calm down.

321
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,541
They just gave me some
fruit as a thank-you gift

322
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,208
for a kindness I paid them.

323
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,041
Yeah.

324
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,291
Huh?

325
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,625
This is Cee nut, Master!

326
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,291
It's really yummy!

327
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,500
Is this Kuko berry?

328
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,416
It's my favorite treat!

329
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,666
Give back! It is for him!

330
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,875
[SATOU]
I have to take it.

331
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,708
They went to all this trouble.

332
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:04,000
But something tells me they need
the fruit way more than I do.

333
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,208
I know!

334
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,875
I'll gladly accept this gift.

335
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,041
But I do have one small request.

336
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,333
See this jerky?

337
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,458
We have so much
we can't eat it all.

338
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,291
Would you take some please?

339
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,208
--Meat!
--Meat!

340
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,583
So kind. You sure?

341
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:22,458
[SATOU]
Yes.

342
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,083
You'd be helping me out.

343
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,541
[DEMI-HUMANS]
Thank you! Thank you!

344
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,125
[NADI] You are now officially
the owner of this cart, Satou.

345
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,500
[SATOU]
Thank you, Nadi.

346
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,208
We can definitely carry
a lot more stuff this way.

347
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,208
[ARISA]
Say.

348
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,166
Why don't we use
our brand new cart

349
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,041
to take sweet Mia back home?

350
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,625
Hold on. Home?

351
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,875
Where is home to Mia, anyway?

352
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,083
[NADI]
The elf village.

353
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,041
It's just southeast
of the Shiga Kingdom.

354
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,291
I see.

355
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,791
Well,

356
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,958
we should talk it over with the
manager when he gets back.

357
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,375
Before we do
anything else though,

358
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,625
I need to learn how
to drive this cart.

359
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,416
I'm counting on you, Lulu.

360
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,333
Pretty weather today.

361
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,500
Oh, yes.

362
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,333
It's pretty indeed.

363
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,666
You know there's no need
to be nervous, right?

364
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,916
I know that you're shy.

365
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,125
But it's cool.

366
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,291
You can relax around me,
like Pochi and Tama do.

367
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,666
Oh no. I am a slave, Master.

368
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,500
It's important that
I keep my place.

369
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,833
[SATOU]
I tried.

370
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,541
But she's about as
forthcoming as the elf princess.

371
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,333
I think I know a topic that'll
make her come out of her shell.

372
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:45,916
Arisa's great!

373
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
She's the best
sister of all time!

374
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,833
[SATOU]
People always talk eventually,

375
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,666
they just need
the right subject.

376
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,583
You really love your
sister a lot, don't you?

377
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,166
Yes!

378
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,625
I bet if you didn't know you'd
think I was the younger sibling.

379
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:00,458
[SATOU]
Yeah.

380
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,208
Can't believe she's just 11.

381
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:06,125
She's been a prodigy ever
since we were both little girls.

382
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,833
[SATOU]
I wonder if Arisa told Lulu

383
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:12,083
she has memories
from her past life.

384
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,708
[LULU] No one had to
teach her that stuff either,

385
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,166
she just knew things!

386
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,750
[SATOU] How about we move
on to the cart lesson, Lulu.

387
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,041
[LULU]
Uh, sorry.

388
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,583
When I talk about my sister,

389
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,000
I blab.

390
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,333
[SATOU]
Must be hard for her.

391
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:14,500
Huh?

392
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,666
Um, Sir?

393
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,333
Is something the matter?

394
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,916
I'm fine.

395
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,250
It's just I saw a big bird in
the trees and got distracted.

396
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,000
Sorry.

397
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,833
Master, you came back to us!

398
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:30,791
[POCHI]
We missed you!

399
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,000
So much!

400
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,458
We're very glad you didn't die.

401
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,666
Hello.

402
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,166
Mia, you're up?

403
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,958
You sure you
should be outta bed?

404
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,625
[MIA]
Yes. Used potions.

405
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,583
The manager brought
Mia some magic potions,

406
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,083
and they helped her a lot.

407
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,375
I don't know
what kind they were,

408
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,625
but they got the job done right!

409
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,500
[SATOU]
I'm glad you're feeling better.

410
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,500
Oh. Thank you.

411
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,500
[SATOU]
Your hair looks cool.

412
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,875
It suits you.

413
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,083
Cool.

414
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,500
Ooo! Since she's on
the road to recovery,

415
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,875
let's eat something delicious
for dinner to celebrate!

416
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:03,958
[SATOU]
Great idea.

417
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,416
What sounds good, Mia?

418
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Honey buns.

419
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,125
Uh, honey buns?

420
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,791
Ever since
Pochi and Tama told her

421
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,208
how delectable honey buns are,

422
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,750
the poor thing can't
stop talking about them!

423
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,250
Honey buns are so good!

424
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,041
I'd eat them every
single day of my life!

425
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,458
Seems to me
the right thing to do

426
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,625
is to get these dears
some honey buns!

427
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,125
Don't you mean you
want some for yourself?

428
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:24,708
Well.

429
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:25,750

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,250
Uh... That's a weird bird.

439
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,833
[SATOU]
It's the one I saw before.

00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,125
[laughs]

441
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,041
[POCHI]
Guess who's back?

442
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:51,916
Satou.

443
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,208
I was hoping you would drop by.

444
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,916
The manager and Mize
are having a little talk.

445
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,833
Mize?

446
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,541
[knock, knock]

447
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,083
Satou.

Satou?

00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,125
My good, sir.

450
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,875
Are you the human
who saved my life?

451
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,333
[SATOU]
Mize, the wererat knight.

452
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,875
Now.

453
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:17,083
I can finally get the answers
I've been waiting for.

454
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,416
Mia was kidnapped

455
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,291
from her quiet elf village
by a band of wizards.

456
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,750
She was imprisoned in
a place called the Cradle.

457
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,125
Luckily, she was able to escape.

458
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,583
On the run,
she bumped into Mize.

459
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,083
They made for Seiryuu City,

460
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,958
hoping to meet up
with the manager.

461
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,583
The wizards who
kidnapped Mia were furious,

462
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,208
so they sent the Flying Ants
to attack the city.

463
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,375
We don't know why Mia
was kidnapped exactly.

464
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,416
But...

465
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,291
...the manager seems
to have an idea.

466
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,541
[SATOU]
Huh?

467
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,083
However, since he doesn't
appear inclined to share,

468
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,375
I'll leave well enough alone.

469
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,958
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.

470
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,208
I need to talk to him about
escorting Mia back home.

They're scared of thunder.

Why is the
lighting man so scary?

480
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,166
A flash then a boom!

481
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,208
Then a terrifying darkness!

482
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,125
It splits trees in two!

483
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,458
[MIA]
Lightning is dangerous.

484
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,791
I know this!

Aze told me.

486

Even big dragons get
knocked out of the sky

by a lightning strike!
