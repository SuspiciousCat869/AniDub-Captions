1
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,000
So, Satou,

2
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,208
do you have any plans
for this afternoon?

3
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:14,750
Yeah, actually,

4
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,541
I was gonna ask the
odd-jobs-people to help me

5
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,083
find housing that
accepts demi-humans.

6
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:20,250
The stables are fine.

7
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,833
But if I can find a
warm bed for them

8
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,583
to sleep in I'd
feel much better.

9
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:24,958
[ZENA]
Well...

10
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,500
Would it be all right
if I came with you?

11
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,250
[SATOU]
That would be awesome.

12
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,125
[SATOU] Are you sure that's how
you want to spend your day off?

13
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:32,541
Bumming around town with me?

14
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:33,791
Yes!

15
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:09,500
[SATOU]
Excuse me?

16
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:10,708
[NADI]
Coming!

17
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,291
So sorry for the delay.

18
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,666
Greetings, friends,
my name is Nadi.

19
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,000
My job here is to
make sure you find one!

20
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,541
Actually, I'm looking
for a property

21
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,500
to rent for my friends and me.

22
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,083
I can help with that, too.

23
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,958
Right this way, please, sir.

24
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,166
If you're sharing the
space with demi-humans,

25
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,916
it'll need to be in
the heart of West Town,

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,250
or at least somewhere
between there

27
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,041
and the worker's residences.

28
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,541
Good news and bad news.

29
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,583
Bad news is,
there's a lotta crime there.

30
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,791
But the good news is,
it's much cheaper.

31
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,625
So, what's your price range?

32
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,041
Well, with my budget.

33
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,625
Two silvers is the most
I'd prefer to spend.

34
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,875
But if that's not enough,

35
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,250
I'd be willing to go as
high as one gold coin.

36
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,916
At that price point,
your options are fairly limited.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,416
That said, there are a couple
of places I can think of

38
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,208
off the top of my head that
should meet your requirements.

39
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,833
Shall we?

40
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,708
I should probably
tell you: A member

41
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,833
of the crime guild assassinated
the owner of this house.

42
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:09,083
Oh. Well, I guess that explains
why the price is so low.

43
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,000
[WORKER B]
You're showing that skin, honey,

44
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,250
and that's the name of the game.

45
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,833
[SATOU]
Yep.

46
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,500
That is a fully functioning
brothel right across the street.

47
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,125
Thanks but no thanks.

48
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:24,958
[SATOU]
The crime guild

49
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,458
has a hideout right
underneath this place,

50
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,333
complete with a secret tunnel
that leads into the city.

51
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,916
This one gives me a
bad feeling in my stomach.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
I think it's a "no."

53
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,916
I understand.

54
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,916
[NADI]
Don't lose hope.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,416
I'll head back to the office and
see if there are any properties

56
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,416
that are more
suitable to your needs.

57
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,666
[SATOU]
That'd be great, thanks.

58
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,083
I'll swing by
later this evening.

59
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,208
Hopefully you
have a little luck.

60
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,708
So what's next?

61
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,875
Is there anything you'd
like to do today, Zena?

62
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,125
Uh. No, what about you?

63
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,125
[NADI] Well, if you're
looking for something fun to do,

64
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,333
a new flea market just
opened in the plaza up ahead.

65
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,750
Generally speaking,

66
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,750
they have really modest prices
on most of their goods.

67
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,583
My manager and I were
actually planning to go, too.

68
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:07,041
[SATOU]
Interesting. Hmm...

69
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,750
[NADI] The outdoor theater
is absolutely to die for.

70
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,791
It's the perfect spot
for a date.

71
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,583
A date?

72
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,166
[SATOU]
Hmm? What's wrong?

73
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,625
Oh, nothing.

74
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,875
[MALE VILLAGER A]
I'll take one!

75
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,500
[POCHI]
Lookie-loo!

76
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,166
It's the master!

77
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,791
Oh, yay!

78
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,208
How was the shopping, girls?

79
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,583
[POCHI]
Good!

80
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:33,958
[ARISA giggles]

81
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,083
The packages were heavy

82
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,750
so we dropped
them off at the inn.

83
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,125
But... look at my dress!

84
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:39,791
Master?

85
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,000
You like?

86
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,375
You look lovely!

87
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,625
Oh, your hair's different.

88
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,166
Yes, it is.

89
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,333
I was getting peculiar looks
on account of my purple hair.

90
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,708
I decided to make a change!

91
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,666
[SATOU]
Makes sense.

92
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,541
Master!

93
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm glad you're here.

94
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,083
If it's all right, I have a
small favor to ask of you.

95
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,541
Don't cling to me.

96
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,375
If you need something, just ask.

97
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,250
[SATOU]
Cards, huh?

98
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,833
Art on the front.

The language of the
Saga Empire on the back.

100
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:09,750
Hey, this might come in handy

101
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,458
for teaching Pochi
and Tama how to read.

102
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,833
I like your cards.

103

That's kind of you to say, sir.

104

They're for learning Shigan!

[SATOU]
Wow!

The performance
is about to begin, Master.

107
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,333
If we don't hurry,
we might miss the show.

108
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,583
You lead the way, then.

109
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,166
[ARISA]
Did you buy tickets yet?

110
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,250
Tickets?

111
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,666
[LIZA]
Worry not, Master.

112
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,958
We'll take care of that part.

113
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:34,708

Okay.

114
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,166
Here's some money.

115
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,125
I'm sorry about this, Zena.

116
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,750
But I promised Arisa I would
let the girls come to the play.

117
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,500
Oh. That's okay!

118
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,333
[SATOU]
Check it out.

119
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,416
I think these earrings

120
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,625
would compliment
your hair color nicely.

121
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,666
Wow.

122
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,916
They're so cute.

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,708
Do they suit me?

124
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,166
Yeah. For sure!

125
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,375
Thanks.

Well, In that case,

let's get something for Lulu,

Hooray!

131
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,333
[SATOU] I wish Zena
would ask me for stuff.

132
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,250
It sure would make it
easier to shop for her.

133

Rather than under
the pale moonlight--

Use a magic spell to
free me from this castle,

00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:39,291
which to my weary
eyes seems an iron cell!

144
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,416
[SATOU] Tragic romances
are super freakin' lame.

I'm sorry about that.

148
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,041
It's fine.

I guess they fell asleep.

Whoa. She's into it!

No, wait.

those skewers cooking
right outside the theater.

[sighs]

156
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,000
[SATOU] This play,
"The Tragedy of Marquis Muno,"

157
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,625
is based on a true story.

158
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,291
The protagonist of the piece,
Zen, is a commoner wizard

159
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,458
who has a deep and
ultimately tragic romance

160
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,000
with Princess Liltiena.

161
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,791
Not only does her fiancé,
Marquis Muno, brutally murder

162
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,333
nearly every member
of Zen's extended family--

163
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:29,166
Zen himself is murdered by one
of the princess's attendants.

164
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,291
In the end, Princess Liltiena
takes her own life.

165
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,458
Which is what the audience

166
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,833
will want to do by
the end of the story.

167
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,333
[AUDIENCE shocked sounds]

168
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,916
It's just the audience.

169
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,666
[SATOU] Aww man,
I thought that was the end.

170
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,541
Wishful thinking, I guess.

171
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,708
[SATOU]
The body of the protagonist,

172
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,208
which was thrown from a cliff,
reanimates, becoming undead.

173
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,541
He goes on a violent rampage,

174
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,875
killing everyone at
the Marquis' estate.

175
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,666
Just as he's about to succeed?

176
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,000
Just as he's about
to kill the Marquis?

177
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,875
A Holy Knight kills him first.

178
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,000
Talk about anti-climactic.

179
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,916
Oh. Sweet Holy Knight!

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,125
[SATOU]
Not only that,

181
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,333
but the Marquis' whole
personality changes.

182
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,666
And then he dies because of

183
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,166
some weird, "bizarre-o"
curse from his marquisate.

184
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,208
The result is a finale
remarkable only for its opacity.

185
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,875
[SATOU]
Gabo flatbread?

186

Isn't gabo a vegetable
in that game <i>Airrim</i> ?

187
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,166
[SATOU]
You dropped this!

188

for your kindness, sir.

189
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,333

You're the young
man from the show!

191
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,625
[SATOU] Sorry again for
what happened back there.

192
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,000
It was nothing.

193
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,750
So what did you think about
the ending of the play?

194
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,000
Dreadful, wasn't it?

195
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,458
Uh. Well.

196
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,000
[FEMALE VILLAGER A] In the
script, the wizard is killed

197
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,291
by the Holy Knight after he gets
his revenge on the Marquis.

198
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,791
But the nobles complained,
so they changed the ending.

199
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,250
In the real story, the
princess is a commoner,

200
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,500
and yet, the marquis
desires her still.

201
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,708
Despite the fact that she's
married to another man,

202
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:05,958
the lecherous swine,

203
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,291
consumed with lustful
yearning, kidnaps her.

204
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,666
The nobles should have left well
enough alone if you ask me,

205
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,416
which of course nobody did!

206
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,708
[SATOU] So a bunch of idiots
meddled with a writer's work

207
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,791
and the result was
a complete disaster?

208
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,166
Shocking.

209
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,291
Ah!

210
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,666
[POCHI]
There you are, Master!

211
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,916
[TAMA]
We've been looking for you!

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,083
Sorry about that,
I had to use the bathroom.

213
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,416
[ARISA]
I loved it so much!

214
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,416
Wasn't that just the
most delightful story

215
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,875
you've ever heard?

216
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,500
It was beautiful.

217
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,166
I wept when the princess killed
herself after the wizard died.

218
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,708
So sad!

219
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:36,333
[ARISA]
Huh?

220
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,500
Instead of dying,

221
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,875
she should've secretly
taken that sword,

222
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,250
marched up to the marquis,

223
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,791
and stabbed him right
in his big ole stupid face!

224
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,333
The marquis was
the root of the problem,

225
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,916
trying to separate two
people who love each other!

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,333
Huh?

227
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,083
Perhaps. But it was the
princess who broke the promise

228
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,041
of the arranged marriage upon
which both families had agreed.

229
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,708
So in one sense,
the whole ordeal is her fault.

230
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,125
[ARISA]
Oh, come on!

231
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,541
Tell me: Who would you
rather marry, my master,

232
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,166
or some rich blowhard who
was forced down your throat?

233
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,791
Ah! Well...

234
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,333
I am not betrothed to anyone,
if you must know!

235
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,000
That's because you
joined the military,

236
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,083
so your parents couldn't force
you to marry against your will!

237
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,916
In these parts,
after women tie the knot,

238
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,833
they're in charge of
running the household,

239
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,833
but joining the military
means five years of service!

240
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,125
[SATOU] Is there something
going on here I don't get?

241
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,416
[ARISA]
...for the person you love,

242
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,208
then you have zero
business putting on a ring!

243
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,500
Forced marriage or not!

244
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,791
Yes. That's true.

245
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,458
But the head of the
family is still in charge!

246

[ARISA] Keep playing the good
girl and watch what happens.

You'll have your man stolen
right out from under you.

The wererat riders were the ones

too much attention.

324
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,875
[SATOU]
Those suckers are fast.

325
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,291
What the hell?

326
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,041
[ARISA] Looks like my protective
barrier above the city

327
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,625
is doing its part
to stave them off.

328
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,333
[SATOU] It's not doing its
job well enough, I'm afraid.

329
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,333
[ARISA] Do you know how much
MP I'd have to burn through

330
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,708
to create a magic barrier

331
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,000
as impenetrable
as a physical wall?

332
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,625
It's an unbelievable amount!

333
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:48,875
Arisa.

334
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,708
Take Lulu and go hide
in the back of that bar.

335
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:51,875
You got it.

336
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,833
[SATOU]
Pochi, Tama, protect the inn.

337
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,833
Okie-dokes.

338
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,666
Master, what will you do?

339
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,458
We need to focus our defense
on the main entry point.

340
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,000
It's time to build
a barricade, Liza!

341
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,750
[THORN]
Hurry up and get inside!

342
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,208
Don't lose heart, men,
it's one monster!

343
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,833
We've got nothing to fear!

344
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,291
Fallen Hammer!

345
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,000
[SOLDIER A]
Fire!

346
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:22,958
You ready?

347
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,000
Yes, Master.

348
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,416
I always am.

349
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,250
We won't let you through, ants!

350
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,875
Sorry! Road's closed!

351
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,750
Hyah! All right!

352
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:42,125
Ah!

353
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,291
That was a close one!

354
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,875
Thank you so much, Tama!

355
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,458
Fuhgeddaboudit.

356
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,791
[SATOU] She sounded just
like a movie mobster.

357
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,750
Did Arisa teach her that?

358
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,833
[SATOU]
She must've used psychic magic.

359
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,333
Looks like a few
of the ants made it

360
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,375
inside the building
where Nadi works.

361
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,375
It's settling outside.

362
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,291
Liza!

363
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,666
I'll let you take it from here!

364
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,041
All right!

365
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,791
[SATOU]
Nadi! Are you okay?

366
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,958
[NADI]
Yes! I think so!

367
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,958
[SATOU] The stairs are
covered in ant poison.

368
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,166
Guess I could smash a rock
and use it for footing.

369
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,625
[YUSARATOYA spell chant]
Ivy Control!

370
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,458
Manager?

371
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,000
You saved me, Satou.

372
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,708
Thank you.

373
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,750
[NADI]
And one for you, too.

374
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,291
Thank you.

375
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,416
[NADI]
You're so welcome.

376
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,250
I am very grateful, sir.

377
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,500
[YUSARATOYA]
Who's this?

378
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,750
He came here looking for
a place to rent earlier.

379
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,750
And then he saved
me from the ants.

380
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,208
Thank you.

381
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,875
[SATOU] The fantasy world's
most popular race by far.

382
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,041
 An elf!

383
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,708
[NADI]
Is something the matter?

384
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,958
Oh, no.

385
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,458
It's just I don't think
I've ever met someone

386
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,500
with green hair.

387
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,791
[NADI]
Heh. Well, his hair is green

388
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,250
because he is an
elvish forest spirit.

389
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,541
[SATOU] Wait a second,
I thought elves had long ears.

390
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,041
[YUSARATOYA]
Hmph. How rude.

391
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,625
Oh, no, that's a different
race called the Long-ears.

392
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,583
And don't worry,
it happens a lot.

393
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,166
And, in fact, it always has.

394
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,458
Since the first hero called
the Long-ears, "elves."

395
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,083
It's hard to believe,
but people have been making

396
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,583
that mistake for well over
a millennium now.

397
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,708
Truth is,

398
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,875
elves hate being
mistaken for a Long-ear.

399
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,833
Isn't that right, Manager, sir?

400
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,583
I honestly didn't know.

401
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:36,666
Manager, please
forgive me for my ignorance.

402
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,000
[YUSARATOYA]
You're forgiven.

403
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,125
Ya see?

404
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,250
Oh my.

405
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,500
[SATOU] We can discuss the
housing situation another time.

406
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,375
[NADI]
Right!

407
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,416
Thank you again for saving me!

408
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,375
[SATOU]
Crisis averted.

409
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:53,375
Ah! Oh, there you are!

410
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,041
Ah!

411
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,083
Are you all right?

412
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:56,750
Yes.

413
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,041
So sorry.

414
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,333
[ZENA] We're all lucky to
have survived that ordeal.

415
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,958
Well, I'd better join my
fellow guardsmen in town.

416
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,666
They'll need me if any bugs
slipped through our ranks.

417
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,041
[SATOU]
What a shame.

418
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,083
It's your day off, and
here you are, working again.

419
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,333
I'm really disappointed

420
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,375
that our day together
ended the way it did.

421
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,708
But even so,

422
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,791
it was a lot of fun spending
some time with you.

423
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:19,791
I should go.

424
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,375
I'm sure there are more coming.

425
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:25,000
I need to be there to help
fend them off when they do.

426
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,333
[SATOU]
Be careful!

427
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,750
Bye!

428
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,500
[SOLDIER B] Does this
slave belong to you, kid?

429
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,375
I am back, Master.

430
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,333
The law says that
all persons are required

431
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,041
to sell their cores to
the city government, sir.

432
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,208
[SATOU]
One moment.

433
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,291
[SOLDIER B]
Hmm?

434
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,333
We just need to
draw up a receipt first.

435
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,750
Give it a look, sir.

436
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,125
This'll show the number
of cores and the amount paid.

437
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,500
Oh yeah.

438
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,458
It'll show your name
and identification, as well.

439
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,875
Now, look here, kid.

440
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,666
I hope you're not insinuating
I was gonna steal them!

441
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,750
[SATOU]
Not at all.

442
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,916
But you can never
be too careful.

443
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,208
You're a good man.

444
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,166
But it doesn't matter
if you're a holy saint.

445
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,875
If you wanna purchase my cores?

446
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,333
Then I'm gonna need
a receipt, mister.

447
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:12,583
[SOLDIER B groans]
Good enough for you?

448
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,833
Your numbers are wrong, friend.

449
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:16,875
And there's no seal.

450
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:17,916
Let's fix that.

451
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,500
[SOLDIER B]
I just forgot is all!

452
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,000
[SATOU] These days,
everybody's out to make a buck.

453
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,375
[ARISA]
What a lovely meal!

454
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,000
Ya know what
that smell is, girls?

455
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:31,875
Joy!

456
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,833
Time to eat meat!

457
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,333
Just a little longer, ladies.

458
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,500
These two girls are
something else, Satou.

459
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,916
They're tiny as little teacups,

460
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,333
yet they still protected
my inn from harm.

461
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,625
Nyan.

462
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,500
[MOSA] I can never
repay you for your bravery.

463
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,041
But I'll tell you what I'll do:
Let me get my husband to whip up

464
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,708
his best meal and make you
a feast you'll never forget!

465
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,875
[GIRLS]
Bless this food!

466
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,041
[SATOU] I guess Lulu's
not feeling any better.

467
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,375
[SATOU] Maybe there's
a pharmacy in town.

468
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,583
[MALE VILLAGER C]
Oh, Young Master!

469
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,208
[MALE VILLAGER D] Aren't you
the kid from the labyrinth

470
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,166
the other day?

471
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,541
Yeah.

472
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,958
[MALE VILLAGER C]
We're not gonna let our savior

473
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,750
walk the streets
at night all alone.

474
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,666
Come on, let us buy you a drink.

475
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,791
[SATOU] Uh. Actually,
I was heading somewhere.

476
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,625
Hey, don't worry, buddy,
it's just one drink.

477
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,458
Bye bye!

478
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,791
Come and see us
anytime you want!

479
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,625
[SATOU]
That escalated quickly.

480
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,208
I thought they were
gonna buy me a beer,

481
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,375
not take me to a brothel.

482
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,958
[SATOU]
The feather of a Shadow Owl?

483
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,375
Maybe Pochi and
Tama would like this.

484
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,166
[SATOU]
Monsters?

485
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,666
[gasps]

486
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,291
[SATOU]
Are you all right?

487
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,416
[MIZE]
Who are you?

488
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,208
[SATOU]
A red helmet.

489
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,541
[MIZE]
Who are you?

490
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,458
Tell me the truth:
Are you one of his men?

491
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,833
Whose men?

492
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,041
Huh? What's this?

493
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,041
I won't make it much
longer, I'm afraid.

494
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:41,833
Please.

495
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,708
Take care of the princess.

496
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,250
[SATOU]
Hang in there!

497
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,833
[SATOU] Nadi's status
says she's asleep.

498
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,916
The manager's too.

499
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,666
I've no choice.

500
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,583
[NADI]
Uh, Manager?

501
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,833
Are you going to join me in bed?

502
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,333
[YUSARATOYA]
No.

503
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,250
[SATOU] I feel bad for how
into that Nadi just sounded.

504
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,625
[SATOU]
Good evening.

505
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,125
Sorry to intrude.

506
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,208
It's Satou.

507
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,541
Is something wrong?

508
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,541
[SATOU] I brought someone
who knows the manager.

509
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,708
He's hurt.

510
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,208
I was hoping you would
be able to help heal him

511
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,250
with a magic spell.

512
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,250
[YUSARATOYA spell chant]
Mana Light.

513
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,375
I recognize that red helmet.

514
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,333
I might be mistaken,
but from what I've heard,

515
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,375
he could be Red Mask,
the infamous wererat knight.

516
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,791
Have we met?

517
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,041
[SATOU]
No.

518
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,083
He's not the one
I'm referring to.

519
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,625
[gasps]

520
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,208
[gasps]

521
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,875
[NADI]
I think that's an elf!

522
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,333
[YUSARATOYA]
Mia.
