1
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:20,875
[SATOU] Apparently,
skills aren't the only things

2
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:22,666
that're easy to come by here.

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,333
Titles are, too.

4
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,250
[SATOU]
Hey, are you okay?

5
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:30,333
Oh, yeah, by the way: I wouldn't
look down if I were you.

6
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:31,750
[ZENA]
Huh? Huh?!

7
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,041
Ah!

8
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,625
[SATOU]
I warned you.

9
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,250
Let's get outta here.

10
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:15,875
[ZENA]
Thank you for the catch.

11
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,125
I don't remember much.

12
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,458
Only the wyvern
swooping down on me.

13
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,541
I was working my way up
that cliff when, out of nowhere,

14
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,750
you just came flying
down from the sky.

15
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,291
Well, I'm glad you were there.

16
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,916
I'm pretty sure you
just saved my life.

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,291
[SATOU]
If I were a younger man,

18
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,916
I'd be head over heels
in love right about now.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,083
Oh, by the way, my name's Satou.

20
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:34,958
Yes, well.

21
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,958
It's so nice to meet you.

22
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:38,791
[SATOU]
That was dumb.

23
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,958
I should've asked her
for her name first.

24
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,791
Forgive me, my name's Zena.

25
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:46,166
I'm 17 and I'm a military mage
on retainer of Count Seiryuu.

26
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,583
I've served in the
territorial army for two years.

27
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,708
I'm not yet married.

28
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,458
Uh. No boyfriend either.

29
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:55,166
[SATOU] Uh... Where I come
from, that's called TMI.

30
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,958
Stop right there, scum!

31
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,250
Move away from the girl!

32
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,000
[ZENA]
No, Lilio!

33
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:00,750
Don't hurt him!

34
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,833
He's all right!

35
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,875
We're trying to
save your life, Zena!

36
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,458
Oh. You don't have
anything to fear from me.

37
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,208
I'm just a traveling merchant.

38
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,625
The name's Satou.

39
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,916
A merchant with zero goods?

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,833
Sounds fishy.

41
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,166
[SATOU]
She's right.

42
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,666
What sort of a traveling
merchant carries his wares

43
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,083
in a satchel like this?

44
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,000
This is sort of embarrassing but
when that big meteor shower hit,

45
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,708
my packhorse got
spooked and took off.

46
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,666
[SATOU]
I don't really want that skill.

47
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,541
Do you mean the starfall?

48
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,833
That might scare a horse.

49
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,541
But if you'd seen it hit.

50
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,458
You wouldn't be
standing here right now.

51
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,208
You would've run the other way.

52
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,333
The man who saved
my grandfather's life?

53
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,708
He's buried in a grave
near Warrior's Fort.

54
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,541
I journeyed there
to pay my respects.

55
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,208
The starfall happened
when I first arrived.

56
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,458
My horse ran this way.

57
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,416
Show me your papers right now.

58
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,625
You don't need those!

59
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,083
Rules are rules.

60
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,291
Thing is...

61
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,000
I left my papers inside
the pocket of a coat

62
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,666
on the back of my packhorse.

63
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,333
I have nothing to
show you, ma'am.

64
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,333
[IONA sighs]
Very well.

65
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,083
We'll issue new papers
in Seiryuu City.

66
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,000
[SATOU] Maxing out my
trickery and persuasion skills

67
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,666
really did the trick.

68
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,000
I feel so dirty.

69
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,208
[ZENA] And so, shortly
after the starfall's impact,

70
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,208
we were dispatched from
Seiryuu City to the area

71
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,041
where you ended up finding us.

72
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,958
Our orders were to assess
any potential damage.

73
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,208
[SATOU]
A wyvern corpse?

74
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:37,250
[ZENA] Wyvern hides are tough,
so they make for sturdy armor.

75
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,500
We can usually sell
it for a decent profit.

76
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:40,833
Yes, that's very true.

77
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,833
Good armor, but bad food.

78
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:43,625
Really bad.

79
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,000
It's cheap, though.

80
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,333
Sometimes they force us
to eat wyvern to save coin.

81
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,083
Does it taste pretty bad?

82
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,500
It tastes like dirt, kid.

83
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,291
First time I put that
garbage in my mouth,

84
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,250
I spit it right
back in the bowl!

85
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,375
Of course, the slaves in
West Town don't complain

86
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,833
about wyvern meat or any other
kinda food, they'll eat it all.

87
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,833
[SATOU] I didn't realize
they have slaves here.

88
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,833
I sure hope they don't feed me
wyvern when we get to town.

89
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,208
Approximately 80 percent
of Seiryuu City's residents

90
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,541
are full citizens.

91
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,500
The other 20 percent are slaves.

92
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,083
And they're not all human.

93
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,458
[SATOU]
Huh... Cool. There's an elf.

94
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,625
Oh, and some sort
of magical being.

95
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,958
[ZENA]
Look, Satou.

96
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,916
The city's straight ahead!

97
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,666
I meant to ask you.

98
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,375
Do you have somewhere
to stay in town,

99
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,416
or are you in need of
proper accommodations?

100
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,041
Actually, I was thinking about
getting a room somewhere.

101
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,750
In that case, I'd recommend
you try the Gate Inn.

102
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,291
It's just past the main
entrance, on the right side.

103
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,375
A touch pricey,
but it's known far and wide

104
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,916
for its extraordinary cuisine.

105
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,583
[ZENA]
I wish I could stay.

106
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm required to
give a debriefing,

107
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,500
so I'm afraid
I have to be going.

108
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,291
I'll stop by later
to say thank you.

109
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,125
[SATOU] Don't worry, you don't
need to thank me at all.

110
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,583
Satou! I'm a member
of the Marientail family.

111
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,833
I have a duty to show
my appreciation!

112
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,791
[SATOU] Jeez, she doesn't take
no for an answer, does she?

113
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,375
I'll see you soon!

114
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,708
[SATOU]
I might be reading into it,

115
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,833
but I totally think
she's in love with me.

116
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,000
[chuckles]

117
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,083
So! How can I help you, Iona?

118
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,875
We owe this man our thanks
for saving Zena's life.

119
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,500
He's lost his papers,
and if you don't mind,

120
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,458
I would like you
to reissue them.

121
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,416
[THORN]
Of course.

122
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,125
The Yamato Stone?

123
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:34,708
[IONA]
Yes.

124
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,791
Thank you.

125
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,166
Well, young man.

126
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,791
Place both of your hands
on the Yamato Stone, please.

127
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,333
[SATOU]
Yamato Stone?

128
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,041
Should be interesting.

129
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,500
I'm required to ask this.

130
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,416
Are you now, or have
you ever been in the past,

131
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,916
a fugitive from the law?

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,125
Oh. No, sir.

133
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,208
State your name, please.

134
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,541
[SATOU]
My name...

135
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:58,166
I guess my real name
isn't going to fly here.

136
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,625
Satou.

137
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:06,458
[SATOU]
Uh. My user profile!

138
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,583
Looks like this
is the information

139
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:11,083
from before I leveled up.

140
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,416
This just gets weirder
and weirder.

141
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,291
All right, kid.

142
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,208
You can take your off hands now.

143
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,750
So, you're a grown up, eh?

144
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,916
I thought you were
a lot younger.

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,958
In any case, you're an adult
and you're level one.

146
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,208
Guess your parents never
let you outta the house.

147
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,750
No, they really didn't.

148
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,958
They consider
15 an "adult" here?

149
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,250
[THORN]
Done.

150
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,041
Here.

151
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,083
Try not to lose it again.

152
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,541
You owe me one silver coin.

153
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,125
[SATOU]
Sure.

154
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,291
[THORN]
That's not all.

155
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,625
City entrance tax
is one copper, kiddo.

156
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,500
But, this young man
saved Zena's life.

157
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,666
We can forgive the tax just
this once, don't you think?

158
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,916
Why not?

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,916
Don't forget this:
It's your city entry visa.

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,750
It's valid for ten days.

161
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,208
If you'd like to
stay in town longer...

162
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,541
...you'll have to request an
extension here at this station

163
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,083
or in Central at town hall.

164
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,125
It'll cost ya three copper
no matter where you go.

165
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,541
[SATOU]
Thanks.

166
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,041
One more thing.

167
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,416
If one of our guards catches
you with an expired visa,

168
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,958
you're gonna owe
a fine of one silver.

169
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,000
If you can't pay,
you'll be made into a slave,

170
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,458
so if I were you,
I'd watch out, kid.

171
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,250
[SATOU]
Right.

172
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,458
Thank you so much, sir.

173
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,958
[SATOU] A life of bondage
'cause you overstay your visa?

174
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,333
Harsh.

175
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,666
[IONA]
Do you see that yellow sign?

176
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,041
That's the Gate Inn; the place
I was telling you about.

177
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,583
Thanks a lot for your help.

178
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,833
Great to meet you, Iona.

179
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,750
I'll see you around!

180
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,708
This townscape is
so freakin' cool.

181
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,333
As a nerd who's devoted

182
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,750
his entire life to creating
new worlds inside a computer,

183
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,333
I have a total dork
boner right now.

184
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,333
[MARTHA]
You there!

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,125
You just came in from
outside the front gate, right?

186
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,291
If you need a room,
then you should stay with us!

187
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,791
We'll give you a stellar deal!

188
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,291
Our rooms are clean
and comfortable,

189
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,041
and plus our food's
the best in town by far!

190
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,166
[SATOU]
Who's she?

191
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,000
[SATOU]
Thirteen?

192
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,666
For a 13 year old
she is very mature.

193
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,583
The yellow sign.

194
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,000
This is the place.

195
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,500
[MARTHA]
Guess what, Mom?

196
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,666
I brought a customer!

197
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,916
Darling, did you force
him to come here?

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,541
Oh no, she didn't at all, ma'am.

199
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,875
I could get used to this.

200
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,000
[MARTHA]
Mom! I wasn't pushy...

201
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,208
[SATOU]
And this lady innkeeper?

202
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,125
I'm gonna be honest:
It's been a while for me,

203
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,750
but she's looking
pretty hot herself.

204
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,083
Uh. Pardon me.

205
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,666
Do you have any luggage, sir?

206
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,875
Oh, uh... Thing is...

207
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,291
I lost all my belongings
when my packhorse ran away

208
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,666
on account of the starfall.

209
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,125
Lucky for me,
I still have my wallet,

210
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,000
otherwise I'd be in
big trouble right now.

211
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,791
That must've been
really tough on you.

212
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,708
For one copper a night you
get a nice room to yourself.

213
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,875
Meals cost extra,
but it is worth the price,

214
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,250
you get a free item per meal.

215
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,500
In that case,
I'll stay ten nights.

216
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,541
Perfect.

217
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,333
That'll be two silvers
on the dot.

218
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,666
[SATOU]
I see.

219
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,583
That means five large
coppers equal one silver.

220
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,750
Ma'am?

221
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,125
Could I get something
to eat right now?

222
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,500
Sorry, we've already put
the fire out in the kitchen.

223
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,833
I do have some leftover
quiche from this morning,

224
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,125
is that all right?

225
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,833
[SATOU]
Great! I'll take that, then.

226
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,458
[MOSA]
Bon appetit!

227
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,250
That'll be one copper, sir.

228
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,416
The dish is our gift.

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,333
Mom's quiche is always good,

230
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,958
but it's much tastier
when it's still fresh.

231
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,416
Martha, dear.

232
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,458
Have you cleaned the room
of those cowardly merchants?

233
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,166
They left several hours ago.

234
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,583
Sorry, I haven't.

235
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,000
See you later, Satou!

236
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,458
[SATOU]
Cowardly merchants?

237
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,500
Yes.

238
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,208
They were not
the bravest of men.

239
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,125
When the starfall hit,
the merchants panicked

240
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,750
and started screaming
all sorts of insanities!

241
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,416
"The Demon Lord is
fighting the dragons!"

242
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,041
So, there's a Demon Lord?

243
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,000
Well, there was, long ago.

244
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,958
It's been about 60 or 70 years
now since a hero defeated him.

245
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,250
It's possible he's revived
in another country,

246
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,083
but as of yet, I have not
heard a word about it.

247
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,708
[SATOU]
Hope he doesn't come back.

248
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,500
Demon Lords suck.

249
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,291
I'm glad the hero took him out.

250
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,125
If this works like a game,
then the Demon will revive

251
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:23,250
as the main character
progresses through the world.

252
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,916
But even if the Demon Lord
does rear his head,

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,208
he'll attack Labyrinth City
before here.

254
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,916
That's at the opposite
end of the country.

255
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,125
[SATOU chuckles]

256
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,708
This conversation is
totally freaking me out.

257
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:34,958
In this part of the world,

258
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,375
wyverns are a
much bigger threat.

259
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,791
Do ya have issues with
dragons around here?

260
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,083
[MOSA] You hear
about them in legends,

261
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,458
but dragons aren't a
problem in these parts.

262
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,250
They're asleep in
the Valley of Dragons,

263
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,916
so we rarely see them.

264
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,458
The last one we saw
was over two years ago.

265
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,625
And the time before that?

266
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,708
Well, was long
before I was born.

267
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,000
A black dragon
attacked back then.

268
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,916
It ate all the sheep and goats;
put the whole community at risk.

269
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,375
[SATOU] Why is she talkin'
about freakin' livestock?

270
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,916
I'm worried about
human casualties.

271
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,708
[PATRON]
Innkeeper! A moment please!

272
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,166
[MOSA]
I'm coming!

273
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,958
Hello, sir!

274
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,666
[SATOU]
Welp, we're done talking.

275
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,708
In that case,
time to dig in.

276
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,958
The main dish is quiche
with a whole lotta potato.

277
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,416
It's cold.

278
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,833
But it's really delicious,
nonetheless.

279
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,458
[SATOU] I thought this was bok
choy, but it's actually cabbage.

280
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,041
[SATOU] Reminds me
of the sauerkraut I ate

281
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,666
when I went on that
super-cheap trip to Germany.

282
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,708
[MARTHA]
Tasty, right?

283
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,458
I told ya the
food's really good.

284
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,541
Uh, hey, you're back.

285
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,083
Are you finished
with your chores?

286
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:44,916
[MARTHA]
Yep.

287
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,291
I meant to ask.

288
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,208
Is there a place close
to here that sells supplies?

289
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,791
[MARTHA]
Supplies, huh?

290
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,125
Hmm...

291
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,750
You can purchase some
used items and old clothes

292
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,083
from the booths
over on West Street.

293
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,666
New clothes always
cost an arm and a leg,

294
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,166
but if that's your fancy,

295
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,041
go see a tailor at one of
the shops on Central Street.

296
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,458
I was thinking pre-fab.

297
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,208
You know, clothes that
have already been made.

298
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,208
[MARTHA]
Hmm?

299
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,500
Oh! Ready-tailored clothes!

300
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,708
I don't think I've
heard a person

301
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,583
use the term "pre-fab" before.

302
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,416
There're some shops
on Tepta Street,

303
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,958
but they're not cheap either.

304
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,833
[SATOU]
Tepta Street.

305
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,875
[MARTHA]
Oh, I know!

306
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,833
I can take you there!

307
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,291
[MALE VILLAGER A]
So how much?

308
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,375
[FEMALE VILLAGER A]
Two bits per item.

309
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,541
[MALE VILLAGER A]
Two bits?

310
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,041
Too much!

311
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,833
[SATOU] Looks like it's
normal to haggle here.

312
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:32,916
Whoa!

313
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,291
That must be a demi-human.

314
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,166
[MALE VILLAGER B]
Damn you, you filthy animal!

315
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,458
Stay away from East Town,
do I make myself clear?

316
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:47,541
You slaves don't deserve
to breath my air.

317
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,333
Do you need something, sir?

318
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,458
[MALE VILLAGER B]
Hah! Are these slaves yours?

319
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,625
Well, put 'em on a leash and
keep 'em in back West Town

320
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,708
where they belong.

321
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,625
Hey, are you all right?

322
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,708
Here. Take it.

323
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,791
Aww!

324
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:14,541
Thank you.

325
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,875
Bless you.

326
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,708
There's a lotta people
in the streets today,

327
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,958
so you be careful.

328
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,791
[chuckles]

329
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,666
What's the matter?

330
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,875
It's just that you
were being so nice

331
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,708
to those two demi-humans.

332
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,250
Are demi-humans widely
hated in these parts?

333
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,666
[MARTHA]
Mm-hmm.

334
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,208
A long time ago, when hunters
and farmers would come

335
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,041
to the city to make an honest
living selling their crops,

336
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,000
the demi-humans
would murder them.

337
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,291
[SATOU]
Huuuh...

338
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,416
I guess that means
they're thieves and bandits.

339
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,583
Ah! Satou, look!

340
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,916
There's something
I want you to see.

341
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,875
You're going to love this!

342
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,583
[SATOU]
She changes gears fast.

343
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,250
If you want it,
it's yours for four copper.

344
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,041
That's two coppers
too much, friend.

345
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,375
These items are really
expensive to make, friend.

346
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,625
I need at least three.

347
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,375
How 'bout two copper
and two bits?

348
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,250
Two copper and four bits
is the floor for me, pal.

349
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,458
Two copper and three bits
or I'm walking away.

350
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,416
You got a deal!

351
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,333
[MARTHA chuckles]

352
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,125
Thanks so much
for the barrette.

353
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,208
Of course.

354
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,125
And thank you for
showing me around.

355
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,708
If I wanted to win her over,

356
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,875
this would be the perfect moment
to shower her with compliments.

357
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,375
[SATOU]
Whoa!

358
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,500
They call this a dragon mask!

359
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,750
We wear them during
the Harvest Festival.

360
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,083
[FEMALE VILLAGER B]
So what's it gonna be?

361
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,625
The dragon mask will
bring you good health

362
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,041
and a safe home, too.

363
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,875
[SATOU]
Oh...

364
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,375
Do you wear the wig
with the dragon mask?

365
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,708
If you're a dragon,
you wear the mask.

366
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:08,916
The black wig is for people

367
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,083
who want to play
the part of the brave hero.

368
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,000
The gold wig's a
whole different thing.

369
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,583
It's for people who
fancy themselves

370
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,875
the hero's damsel in distress.

371
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,416
[SATOU] I couldn't make up my
mind, so I decided to splurge:

372
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,375
I got a mask and a wig.

373
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,166
With a title like that,

374
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,583
I'm guessing she doesn't
have many friends.

375
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:46,833
Hmm? What?

376
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,375
Nothing, I'm fine.

377
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,458
[YUNI hums]

378
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,458
Huh?

379
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,333
Martha!

380
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,958
You're back!

381
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,666
Come meet our guest!

382
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,083
Yuni, this is Satou.

383
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,916
He'll be staying
with us for a while.

384
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,666
Yes, I know, I've already
prepared him a nice room.

385
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,875
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Satou.

386
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,250
For your trouble.

387
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,750
Thank you very much!

388
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:11,375
[SATOU]
Good to know. Tips are normal.

389
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,625
Oh. Almost forgot.

390
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:13,875
Are there baths here?

391
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,250
Well, there's a public
bath in the inner-walls,

392
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,250
but unfortunately, commoners
like us are not allowed there.

393
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,541
[SATOU] Ah. What do you
usually do, Martha?

394
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,000
There's a well right out back,

395
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,916
typically I just
wash myself there.

396
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,291
Well, I guess that's that, then!

397
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,250
I'll have whatever you
recommend for dinner, Martha.

398
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,416
All right.

399
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,791
Would you like
something strong to drink

400
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,208
to go with your tasty meal?

401
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,541
[SATOU]
Not strong.

402
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,583
Just something nice and
smooth to help it go down.

403
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,125
[MARTHA]
Our cider has some bite,

404
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,583
but I could certainly
water it down for you.

405
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,333
If you don't mind
paying a little more,

406
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,000
we have wine and mead.

407
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,416
Mead sounds perfect.

408
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,291
Done. I'll bring it
over to you right away.

409
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,916
Wow. This looks awesome!

410
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,083
[MARTHA] Wild boar steak
and vegetable soup!

411
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,666
And a mug of our
world-famous mead!

412
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,500
Best to eat it while it's hot!

413
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,833
[SATOU] I wasn't being polite,
this looks amazing.

414
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,041
I'll start with
the vegetable soup.

415
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,916
[SATOU] Mmm. The ingredients
are perfectly cooked.

416
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,208
The veggies melt in your mouth.

417
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:24,291
This is what I like
to call a mouth explosion!

418
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,833
The broth is tasty.

419
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,458
I bet this stuff sells
like crazy in the winter!

420
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,125
We're off to a great start.

421
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,291
Next up?

422
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,041
The main course:
wild boar steak.

423
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,458
The last boar I ate left
something to be desired.

424
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,750
Not to mention it
smelled like a shoe!

425
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,041
[SATOU]
It's great!

426
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,333
Not too lean,
but not too fatty either.

427
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,666
It's a little gamy,

428
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,708
but it's got this incredible
rustic flavor to it.

429
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,875
Way better than
your average slab of beef.

430
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,291
[SATOU] The bread's a little on
the tough side, but it's good.

431
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,416
You can tell this
loaf was made with love.

432
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,375
It's fun how crunchy it is!

433
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,333
Ahh...

434
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,041
It's perfection in a mug.

435
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,791
The hint of honey cuts against
the bitterness of the booze.

436
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:09,750
It's strong, too.

437
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,208
I better slow down!

438
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,166
You cleaned your plate.

439
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,333
You want some more?

440
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,333
Yes, I think I do.

441
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,750
[MARTHA giggles]
Right away.

442
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,250
[SATOU groans]

443
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,833
Round two was a mistake.

444
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,791
[SATOU]
But this inn is perfect.

445
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,583
The food's good
and the beds are clean.

446
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,583
The staff's cute, too.

447
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,541
It's the type of service
you could only find in a dream.

448
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,291
[SATOU]
I didn't see any dragons.

449
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,416
But that army of lizardmen

450
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,416
couldn't have been
more realistic.

451
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,333
That battle between
Zena and the wyvern

452
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,916
felt pretty damn real, too.

453
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,250
Like something out of a promo
video for a fantasy RPG!

454
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,708
Also, the level of detail
in Seiryuu City is insane!

455
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:06,208
The variation in the townspeople
alone is mind-blowing!

456
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,916
But hold on.

457
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,208
The things I've seen
in this world?

458
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,625
They don't really match up

459
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,958
with the games and stories
I know from my childhood.

460
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,458
[SATOU] I used to be a
huge nerd in middle school,

461
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,666
but I never dreamed up
something like this.

462
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,291
I'm experiencing
the taste of things

463
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,791
I've never even
imagined before.

464
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,458
[SATOU] This place is
way too vivid and weird

465
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,916
to be just a dream!

466
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,333
But if it isn't a dream.

467
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,166
Then what the hell is it?

468
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,333
It feels like a game,

469
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,625
but I can't log out
or save my progress.

470
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,750
What's the deal,
do I have to beat it to escape?

471
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,583
Do I have to win
to get out of here?

472
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,916
Wait.

473
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,250
In an MMO, the game never
really comes to an end.

474
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,083
[SATOU]
All right!

475
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,791
Whatever information
I need isn't in here!

476
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,041
Let's go!

477
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,583
Whatever this place is, I might
as well make the best of it.

478
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,833
I may not find a way home,
but as far as I'm concerned,

479
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,958
anything beats sitting
behind my stupid desk.

480
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,541
No more death marches
for yours truly.

481
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,958
[SATOU] Since it seems
like I'm stuck here,

482
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:33,250
I'm gonna do what the
younger me would do: have fun.

483
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:39,333
[MARTHA]
Hey, Satou!

484
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,375
Are you awake?

485
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,000
Morning, Martha.

486
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,916
[MARTHA] You need to hurry up
and get dressed right now.

487
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,791
Your girlfriend's waiting!

488
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,166
My girlfriend?

489
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,416
Good morning, Satou.

490
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,291
Sleep well?

491
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,416
Yeah, like a baby.

492
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,458
That's a lovely
outfit you have on.

493
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,750
What brings you
here this fine morning?

494
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,458
[ZENA]
Oh! Well...

495
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,208
I'm uh... I'm off-duty.

496
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,041
I was thinking I'd like to take
you on a quick tour of the city!
