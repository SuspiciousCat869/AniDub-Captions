Hello. My name is Arisa.

Is this girl Japanese?

I have an idea.

Get it off!

00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,333
Disgusting!

00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,833
I hate spiders more
than anything else

[SATOU]
I bought both of them.

I'm such a sucker.

There's a "kumo" in your hair.

00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,125
[SATOU]
I knew she was from Japan.

00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,458
Japanese girls
always hate spiders.

[ARISA]
Like I said, my name is Arisa.

It's been well over a decade

22
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,000
since I was born into the
mysterious Kingdom of Kuvork.

I'm from the Kingdom of Kuvork.

As you can see,
I'm homely, weak and shy, too.

28

But I am sturdy as a pack horse.

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,750
So please don't cast me aside.

A spawn of the Orangescale race.

00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,500
My village was toppled
by the Weaselmen.

37
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,291
Shortly after,
I was sold as a slave.

38
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,166
But I am very proud to have
been sold to the Shiga Kingdom.

An odd-eared race and a slave?

I'll admit, I've never met
anyone quite like you before.

Yeah. They're unique for sure.

Be patient with them.

Aww!

How could I not be patient with
two little cuties like them?

But I shouldn't talk about

Yeah! Meat sounds great!

We will eat
anything you offer us

with a smile on our face
and gratitude in our hearts.

But if I must choose,

78
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,458
then I select poultry
of the chicken variety.

[SATOU] Aren't birds
and lizards relatives?

I'm a bit confused, Master.

As slaves, we aren't supposed to
be particular about what we eat.

I'm curious, what type of
food did you normally get?

85
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,750
We never had a say
in the matter really.

86
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,958
They usually
gave us stale bread.

87
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,125
Day-old soup without any
meat was considered a feast!

88

We were lucky if we
received one meal a day.

89

When they didn't feed us,

90
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,125
we would forage for
fruits, berries, and twigs.

91

One time?

to eat a leaf for breakfast.

But it's not bad.

112

It seems like there're a lotta
manual laborers around here.

113

Maybe this is the
kinda stuff they like?

114
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,791
Food made with entrails
is generally supposed

115
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,375
to have a variety of
textures and flavors,

116
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,791
but there are some
people who have trouble

117
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,541
with the unique aroma.

118
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,708
I don't know if they were
just meticulous in preparing it,

119
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,541
or if there's something
unique about the vegetables

120
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,000
it was simmered with,
but this stuff smells great!

Would you like to
try some of this, kid?

122
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,833
[SATOU] Wow! This is
just like tecchanyaki!

Spicy-spice!

126
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,083
This is hotter than a

If it's too hot don't
force yourselves.

Huh. That's right.

145

was hungry for chicken.

146
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,791
I think I'll buy
her a midnight snack.

147

Hungry?

148
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,708
Umm. Eat?

149
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,291
Make sure that you share it
with your friends, okay?

150
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,750
[ARISA]
Well? What do you think?

151
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,291
You look awesome!

152
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,791
You have quite the eye
for fashion, Master.

How are you, Martha?

157
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,541
Miss Marientail told me
all about your adventures.

158
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,416
It was quite a yarn.

159
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Your room is still as it was,
so you're welcome to rest up,

Without their help, I couldn't
have escaped the labyrinth.

164
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,916
[ARISA]
The labyrinth?

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,541
Actually, I was hoping I could
get a few extra rooms for them.

166
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,833
Is there space?

167
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:14,708
[MOSA]
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,000
But we're all booked up, dear.

169
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,875
[SATOU]
Demi-human haters.

170
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,458
Martha, will you take those
two to my room please?

171
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,875
The rest of us'll just have
to camp outside tonight.

172
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,666
Oh. Master.

173
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,750
You are such a generous soul.

174
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,166
Don't look so mad.

175
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,291
You're likely to frighten us

176
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,750
to the core with those
mean old scowls.

177
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:38,625
Ma'am?

178
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,208
If it's all right by you,

179
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,083
I was hoping we might use your
shed or a stable for the night?

180
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,125
These girls saved
countless human lives

181
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,916
while braving the darkness
and terror of the labyrinth.

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,208
Though they will
receive no medals

183
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,666
for their display of courage,

184
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,750
perhaps you can spare
them a little mercy?

185
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,375
A person's good deeds should
always be paid back in kind.

186
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,166
Oh. Yes.

187
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,708
That's an excellent point.

188
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,833
The shed is chalk
full to the brim.

189
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,875
But the stable has
more than enough room.

190
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,416
I do hope I was helpful, Master.

191
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,208
Yeah, you were.

192
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,833
Thank you for that.

193
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,791
All right.

194
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,708
I think this blanket will
keep you from getting needled

195
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,083
by the hay in your sleep.

196
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,250
[TAMA]
Fluffy-fluff!

197
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,958
[SATOU]
Why did I get "needlework"?

198
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,416
Oh well, maybe it'll
come in handy one day.

199
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,708
If any troublemakers
try to bother you.

200
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,250
Don't kill 'em unless
you have no choice.

201
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,583
If you need help, just shout.

202
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,500
I'll come running
here first thing.

203
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,125
Right. Understood.

204
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,291
Aye-aye!

205
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,208
Okie-dokies!

206
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,583
There's no need for that.

207
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,291
Just take care
of yourself, okay?

208
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,625
Yes. Right.

209
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,541
Oh, no, are you hurt?

210
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,875
No! I'm perfectly fine.

211
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,250
Thank you so much
for asking, Master!

212
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,916
[SATOU] I think Lulu's a bit
uncomfortable around men.

213
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,333
[ARISA]
We're ready for you, Master.

214
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:09,833
[SATOU]
Oh, no.

215
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,250
Are they serious?

216
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,500
Are they nudists?

217
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,041
Is that a thing here?

218
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,250
Ladies, the covers are
a bit on the thin side.

219
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,791
You'll catch a cold like that.

220
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,416
Put something on, please.

221
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,125
Oh. But... our services?

222
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,208
[SATOU]
Uhh.

223
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,833
If she means what
I think she means,

224
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,666
and I'm pretty sure she does?

225
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,708
Yikes.

226
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,208
I'm not interested in that.

227
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,458
'Scuse me?

228
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,875
We've got a big day
tomorrow of shopping

229
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,291
and stocking up on supplies.

230
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,041
So get some rest.

231
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,333
It's okay.

232
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,375
Those days are
all in the past now.

233
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,375
Huh?

234
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,375
[ARISA giggles]

235
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,333
Well, hello.

236
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,291
Did I wake you up?

237
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,416
[ARISA giggles]

238
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,250
Whoops, I stole a little kiss.

239
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,416
[SATOU]
Hold on.

240
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,000
She wasn't in my bed
when I fell asleep.

241
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,000
My mind is telling me no.

242
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,125
But my body?

243
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,125
My body's telling me yes.

244
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:39,958
Wait!

245
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,125
Since when am I a pedophile?

246
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,708
It's like I'm being compelled
to do this against my will!

247
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,291
That's it!

[ARISA giggles]

00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,083
Arisa.

250
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,000
No more using magic, understood?

251
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:56,666
That's an order.

[gasps]

253
00:11:58,791 --> 00:11:59,916
And one more thing!

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,583
Any magic or skills
you've already activated

255
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,291
are to be released at once!

256
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,291
You hear me?

257
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,083
That is an order!

00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,083
[sighs]

259
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,083
[ARISA]
No fair.

260
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,500
[SATOU]
Hmm?

261
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,000
No fair?

262
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:21,041
It's the second time you've
used psychic magic tonight.

263
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,875
First, you used it on the
other guests at the inn.

264
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,958
Probably some trick to
neutralize their disdain

265
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:29,041
for Pochi and the others.

266
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:33,083
And these are the three spells
you were using to manipulate me?

267
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:36,416
Why were you trying to control
me by using a psychic spell?

268
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,125
I don't know what
you're asking me, Master.

269
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,166
Look, from now on,

270
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,208
no more avoiding
the subject either.

271
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,750
Tell me what you
were doing, Arisa.

272
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,791
Might as well see
how effective this is.

273
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,958
I'm going to ask
you one more time.

274
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,291
What were you doing?

275
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,208
I only wanted to
service you, Master.

276
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,208
You have my word.

277
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,291
I still don't understand.

278
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,333
Could you try and
explain it more clearly?

279
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,375
Oh, come on!

280
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,833
What could be clearer than that?

281
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,541
I fell for you the moment
I first laid eyes on you!

282
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,291
Uh...

283
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,625
Uh...

284
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,875
"Fell for me"?

285
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,625
[ARISA]
Your fine, soft, black hair!

286
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,000
Your easygoing attitude!

00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,583
Your cute baby face!

00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,083
Your skinny build!

289
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,291
Your smooth skin with no hair
where there shouldn't be!

290
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,000
All I've ever wanted is
to marry someone like you!

291
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,333
But alas, the perfect man,

292
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,000
the man I've always
dreamed I'd find,

293
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,666
is my master, and he commands
me not to service him!

294
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,083
How can I accept that?

295
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,708
That's why I used a spell.

296
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,416
And if that makes
you angry with me!

297
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,333
Oh well!

298
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,541
So when I didn't
fall for you right away,

299
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,958
you decided to brainwash me?

300
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,791
You make it sound so wrong!

301
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,250
It's the duty of a slave girl
to seduce her master

302
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,750
and do everything she
can to make him feel good!

303
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,583
[SATOU]
That is not right.

304
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,125
I understand.

305
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,166
At least, I think.

306
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,041
I was waiting for you
to come call on me,

307
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,500
but you fell asleep.

308
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,458
That made me unhappy.

309
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,916
So I decided the next best
thing was to crawl in bed

310
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,291
and watch you sleep.

311
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,208
I'm so naughty.

312
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,541
Oops.

313
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,333
[SATOU] You were feeling amorous
and you decided to act on it.

314
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,625
More or less.

315
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,875
[SATOU]
Ugh... Good grief.

316
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,791
She is a hot mess.

317
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,333
I've never seen
these skills before.

318
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,125
Haha.

319
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,416
My name's Tachibana Arisa,

320
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,791
and I'm from Japan,
just like you.

321
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:32,708
[SATOU]
I knew it.

322
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,541
[ARISA]
Well, I was from Japan.

323
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,208
I was reincarnated
in the Kuvork Kingdom.

324
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,833
Strangely, I still
have my memories

325
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,625
from my former life on earth.

326
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,250
Were you reincarnated too?

327
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,208
Wait, what?

328
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,375
I get it.

329
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,875
With soft, smooth,
black hair like that,

330
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,333
I'm guessing you were
summoned here as a hero.

331
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,708
Weren't you, Master?

332
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,333
Look at that, you've
just clammed up.

333
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,083
You're only the second
Japanese person I've met here.

334
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,416
Did you know that?

335
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,125
[SATOU] Wait. Does that
mean Lulu's the other one?

336
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,166
Oh no. Not Lulu.

337
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,833
Although, apparently, her
grandfather was Japanese.

338
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,833
Fate is cruel, is it not?

339
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,916
If she'd been born in Japan,
she could've become a teen idol.

340
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,458
Wait. An idol?

341
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,916
Unfortunately, the people here

342
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,875
don't find her
attractive in the least.

343
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,416
Now, getting back to
the original question.

344
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,833
Were you reincarnated in this
world or are you a transfer?

345
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,500
Truth is, I don't know.

346
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,625
Well.

347
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,083
Maybe I can help!

348
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,083
Tell me: What makes
a transfer different?

349
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,291
[ARISA] People who are
reincarnated in this world

350
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,916
are those who died
in our old world.

351
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
People who are transported here
are compelled to appear

352
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,708
in this world as a result
of summoning magic.

353
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:43,208
They're either summoned
heroes or reincarnations.

354
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,791
So when you're reincarnated,

355
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,208
do you start as a baby?

356
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,625
Yes, in this world,
that's precisely how it works.

357
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,416
[SATOU]
Do people who are transported

358
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,666
keep their original appearance?

359
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,958
Do they look
exactly like they did

360
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,666
before they were transferred?

361
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,333
As far as I know,
when they appear,

362
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,500
they're even wearing the same
clothes they that wore on earth.

363
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,666
And guess what?

364
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,750
Their features
stay the same too--

365
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,500
[SATOU]
Hmm...

366
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,541
[SATOU] I don't think
either applies to me then.

367
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,125
Are you saying you
didn't meet God, Satou?

368
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:16,833
[SATOU]
God?

369
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,208
No, I didn't.

370
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,125
[ARISA]
Oh.

371
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,583
Well, tell me this:

372
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,666
Were you inside a summoner's
circle when you appeared?

373
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,291
[SATOU] No, I was alone
in the wasteland.

374
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,333
[ARISA]
I see.

375
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,833
Did you start out
at a high level?

376
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,333
Like with infinite MP?

377
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,958
And a whole bunch
of crazy skills?

378
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,791
I started at
level one, actually.

379
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,583
My MP was zero.

380
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,333
No skills either.

381
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,541
Wait.

382
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,583
I had those disposable
meteor shower icons.

383
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,750
That's no fun.

384
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,916
Good luck beating
a dumb game like that.

385
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,875
[SATOU]
Hmm...

386
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,291
Uh. So... one question.

387
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,125
Sure, I don't mind telling you!

388
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,875
My bra size is--

389
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,666
[SATOU]
This isn't an order.

390
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,166
So if you don't want to
answer that's totally okay.

391
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,416
Can you tell me how
you became a slave?

392
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,875
[MARTHA]
Satou, are you awake?

393
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,916
Look! Your girlfriend is here!

394
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,625
Oh! No, we're not--

395
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,458
Hey. What's up?

396
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,416
Sorry for the mess, things
have been a little nuts here.

397
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,000
I should put a shirt on.

398
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:27,916
[MARTHA]
Ooo.

399
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,666
Your boyfriend's
got a nice bod--

400
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,208
[gasps]

401
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,375
Oh, Master.

402
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,083
You're scaring me a little.

403
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,916
Please don't hurt me.

404
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,875
You creep.

405
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,625
How could you treat young
girls like objects, Satou?

406
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,083
How could you?

407
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,333
Well, good luck with that.

408
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,750
[yawns]

409
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,208
Aren't you going after her?

410
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,541
I definitely don't
recommend putting it off.

411
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,791
[SATOU]
Zena and I are just friends,

412
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,333
but still, this looks bad.

413
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,000
Please. 

414
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,833
Don't be upset.

415
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:17,833
[ZENA]
I'm not upset.

416
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,041
I'm disappointed!

417
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,083
You were sleeping
with that little girl!

418
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,458
[SATOU] She crawled into my
bed when she was half asleep.

419
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,666
Oh. She did?

420
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,333
But Lilio told me that
men only buy slaves

421
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,541
to satisfy their insatiable
carnal appetites!

422
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,333
[SATOU]
Damn, Lilio!

423
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,750
Look, Zena.

424
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,500
I know some guys are like that,
but I swear, I'm not.

425
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,083
I just bought them cause I
needed help with the day to day.

426
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,291
Oh. You're telling the truth?

427
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,500
[SATOU] I don't know what it is,
but you look different today.

428
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,291
Your clothes are frillier.

429
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,500
There's a new kind of
elegance to your style.

430
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,625
I guess what I mean is,
you look really pretty.

431
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:51,833
When your back's
against the wall,

432
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,833
shower them
with compliments.

433
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:54,875
Thank you.

434
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,833
That's very sweet.

435
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,416
[SATOU]
Hey, Zena!

436
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
There's a store around here that
sells the most beautiful shawls!

437
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:01,666
You wanna go check it out?

438
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,291
I think they'd
look great on you.

439
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:05,875
[ZENA]
Oh, Satou.

440
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,458
That would be lovely!

441
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,291
[chuckles]

442
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:12,916
[ARISA]
There you are!

443
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Welcome home!

444
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,375
I'm very glad to
see all is well again!

445
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,750
[SATOU] Does she
not realize she's the one

446
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,208
who caused the
freakin' problem?

447
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,083
Ow!

448
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,375
Yeah, I'm back.

449
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,500
Go get the others, will ya?

450
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,083
Right!

451
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,625
[SATOU] Can you tell me
how you became a slave?

452
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,791
That story is not a simple one.

453
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,291
When I got here, I tried
to help the country I ruled

454
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,708
using memories
from my former life.

455
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,166
At first things went
smoothly enough.

456
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,791
But then it all took a
sudden turn for the worse.

457
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,416
Conflict started to break out.

458
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,750
In the end, a neighboring
country took over.

459
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,916
[SATOU]
Was someone behind it?

460
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,166
[ARISA]
Yes.

461
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,375
I didn't find out who
till much later, though.

462
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,916
At the time, I was depressed,
but I chalked it up

463
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,958
to the differences between
this world and earth.

464
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,625
After our country was conquered,
they publicly executed the king,

465
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,791
the crown prince,
their consorts,

466
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:15,291
and a slew of loyal subjects
in order to quell dissent.

467
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,625
And then,

468
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,250
they ordered the mages
to force us into slavery.

469
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,750
We were all on our own without a
soul in the world to protect us.

470
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,708
Then one day, out of nowhere,
a demon appeared.

471
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,291
The demon attacked,

472
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,458
toppling both the castle and the
surrounding villages as well.

473
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,541
Everything was
engulfed in flames.

474
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,291
So Lulu and I ran to
the mountains for cover.

475
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,666
We had no food.

476
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,166
We were starving
and close to death.

477
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,958
And that's when that slave
trader, Nidoren, picked us up.

478
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,916
Lulu wasn't feeling well,
so I let her stay in the room.

479
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,291
I hope that's all right?

480
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,750
Thank you for letting me know.

481
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,166
Not a problem.

482
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,166
Here, use this money
to buy clothes

483
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,958
and daily necessities
for the entire crew.

484
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,875
I'll let you be in
charge of negotiations.

485
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,041
Consider it done, Master!

486
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,583
[SATOU]
Liza, watch Arisa's back.

487
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,833
Be on the lookout
for pickpockets, okay?

488
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:13,541
Yes.

489
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,291
I can keep her safe too!

490
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,375
So can I!

491
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,958
[SATOU]
Fine.

492
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,333
You two watch her flanks and
make sure she isn't ambushed.

493
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,208
Can I pretty please
use local security magic

494
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,750
and concealment skills
if I run into trouble?

495
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,958
I forgot that I shut that down.

496
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,125
Permission granted.

497
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,875
Thank you, Master!

498
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,708
Well! We'll be back!

499
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,583
[POCHI]
Ooo, an adventure!

500
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:38,583
[ZENA]
Strange.

501
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,291
They seem to like
working for you.

502
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,791
[SATOU]
Yeah, they do.

503
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,541
Those girls don't deserve
to live their lives as slaves.

504
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,208
But for now,
they're safer that way.
