I'm off this afternoon,
so, um, if you're not busy,

I'd like to take you around
the city for a quick tour!

[SATOU] She's working
really hard to impress me.

00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,500
I'm impressed.

00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,375
That sounds like a lotta fun.

00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,791
You've got yourself a date!

Hello, sir.

11
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,958
Two Seiryuu patties, please.

12
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,750
You got it, miss.

13
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,291
Here you are.

00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you.

00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,125
Enjoy them.

00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,750
Ah! Satou!

17
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,916
I wanted to buy these as a way
of thanking you for saving me.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,333
You're too kind.

19
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,208
If it weren't for you,
I'd still be wandering around.

20
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:18,250
You brought me here to Seiryuu
and helped me land on my feet.

21
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,416
That seems like thanks enough.

22
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,750
[SATOU]
This is good stuff.

23
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,500
It's like a croquet
without the meat.

24
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,500
But unless they sell antacids
here, I better slow down.

25
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,208
Tell the truth,
do you think they taste good?

26
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,833
It's one of the tastiest
treats that I've ever eaten.

27
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm glad.

28
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,000
So what do you wanna try next?

29
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:50,875
They're called
"fried dragon wings,"

30
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,625
but they're not
dragon wings at all.

31
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,708
They're bat wings coated
in black miso sauce.

32
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,916
They are, without a doubt,
Seiryuu's most famous food.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,958
Well, in that case,
I'll take two, please!

Good choice.

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,958
I don't know.

41
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,666
Maybe that clothing
store I went to

42
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,750
on Tepta Street could help
you get the stain out.

43

[JIMAANA] Looks like
someone had a little spill.

How about a special charm
to ease your pain?

No, we're fine.

46

Unless, of course,
you have a charm

47
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,333
that can help make this stain
magically disappear?

48

Funny you should
mention that because,

as a matter of fact,

Sweet!

I just acquired a new skill!

I'm sort of an
aspiring mage myself,

66
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,125
so I've been wondering how
you do your magic chants.

Well. Let's see.

68
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,708
Wind magic
basically starts with:

69
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,000
[spell chant]

70
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,791
There is a cadence
for each spell.

71
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,208
It takes practice,
but you'll get there.

72
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:26,916
Listen:

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,625

Wow. I gotta admit,
I'm incredibly impressed.

76
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,833
Must've taken you a long
time to perfect your craft.

77
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,041
I guess I started
training in earnest

78
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,166
about three years ago.

79
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,708
I didn't know it at the time,

80
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,041
but all the amazing things I was
learning laid the foundation

81
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,791
for me to live my life as
a military mage.

82
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:46,958
When you first start out,

83
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,416
they give you a
children's picture book

84
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,666
with the history of magic in it.

85
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,750
It's a fun way to get
a feel for the poetry

86
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,125
and the musicality
of the art form.

87
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,666
It wasn't easy though.

88
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,833
Every hour of every day
was filled with magic.

Interesting.

00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,041
They start training
'em pretty young.

Oh. I hope I didn't
sound like a complainer.

I'm grateful my parents
raised me that way.

Plus, being able to
use magic spells is fun.

00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,583
More than anything else though,

95
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,875
I really want to
learn how to fly.

What about you, Satou?

97
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,708
What was it about magic
that first interested you?

98
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,750
There aren't
any baths at my inn.

99
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,333
You have to bathe outside.

100
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,416
But if I learn magic, then
I won't have to bathe at all.

101
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,166
Huh?

That's the strangest use
of magic I've ever heard.

You're peculiar, Satou.

106
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,125
I don't think it's that unusual.

Oh no, it really is!

108
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,916
But, I do love the
idea of using magic to fly.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,875
We could go on
a date in the clouds!

00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:51,291
Young fellow, would you
like to try my new ointment?

112
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,875
That depends on what it does.

00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:56,583
It helps with cuts, wounds,
and dry, cracked skin.

00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll get some for the
innkeeper at the Gate Inn.

Is this what you
wanted to see, Satou?

Yeah.

You're right.

126
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,541
[SATOU]
Honestly, I wanted to come

127
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,166
because it's a military facility
and without someone like Zena,

128
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,166
they'd never let me in.

Thanks for making this happen.

130
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,166
Are you sure it's okay for
me to be up here with you?

131
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,750
Yes.

132
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,208
Wyvern attacks are the only real
danger out here in the country.

133
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,416
We're perfectly safe.

Hey, Zena.

135
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,458
What is that thing?

136
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,083
Oh, it's a windmill.

137
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,208
But it can also be
turned into a battery

138
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,916
in the event of a wyvern attack.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,958
Shall we go there?

140
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:50,875
All right!

141
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,416
Great!

142
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,208
Palion Temple is on the way,
so I'll show you that as well.

143
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,500
[ZENA] This is a mural
of the Demon Lord,

144
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,375
and the first Hero in combat.

145
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,375
[SATOU]
Awesome.

146
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,416
He must've been a brave knight.

147
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,625
[ZENA] That weapon he's holding
is known as the holy sword.

148
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,041
Whenever the one
true hero grasps its hilt,

149
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,708
the blade glows blue.

150
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,208
Or so the legend goes.

151
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,500
It's pretty, isn't it?

152
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,791
[SATOU] What if the
person holding the sword

153
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,041
isn't the Hero?

154
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,083
Then it won't glow?

155
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,250
That's right.

156
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,750
Oh.

157
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,125
But they say if the sword
accepts the person holding it,

158
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,666
the blade will still glow.

159
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,166
I'm certain that,
over the years,

160
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,666
many people other than the
Hero have wielded that blade.

161
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,458
[ORNA] It's not always
good that one is able

162
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,083
to use the holy sword.

163

Only heroes who nobly
answer the call

164

of the young goddess Palion,

165
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,000
are truly worthy of fighting
the Demon Lord.

166
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,208
Hello, Priestess Orna.

167
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,625
It's been a long time.

168
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,291
Miss Zena Marientail.

169
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,666
Orna is a high priestess who
serves the great goddess Palion.

170
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,416
But she's also the
daughter of the Count.

171
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,916
As a matter of fact, my mother
acted as her wet nurse.

172
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,166
It's good to see you.

173
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,958
I thought you were
only interested in magic,

174
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,125
and now I discover

175
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,791
romantic interests
are in your future, too.

176
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,333
You don't understand,

177
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,250
[MALE VILLAGER D] Priestess!
Boril's condition is critical!

Of course.

[SATOU]
"The Hero."

182
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,416
Come to think of it, I already
have a lotta titles of my own.

183
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,375
I'll take a quick look.

00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,500
"God-Killer."

185
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,166
Whoa!

186
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,666
I didn't kill a god!

187
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,875
"Dragon-Killer"?

188
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:30,875
"Destroyer"?

00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,125
"Natural Enemy"?

190
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,041
Are you kidding me?

"You've defeated the
Dragon God Aconcagula.

You've acquired
the title: God-Killer."

193
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,500
Apparently, the meteor
shower can kill gods.

194
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,958
Good to know.

195
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,000
It's like I'm using hacks to
make myself more powerful.

196
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,250
Well, for now,
I'd better not do anything

197
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,250
that attracts too
much attention.

198
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,291
Hey, are you all right?

199
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,666
Yes, I'm fine.

200
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,708
It seems you're always there
to catch me when I fall.

201
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,500
[SATOU]
You sly dog.

202
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,833
Satou, look.

203
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,500
The anti-dragon tower.

204
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,541
[ZENA] There's a large magical
cannon installed right inside.

205
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,333
If a dragon or any
flying beast ever attacks?

206
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,708
Then that'll keep the city safe.

207
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,750
See that? The one in ruin?

208
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,000
A dragon destroyed it

209
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,333
during an attack a
little over two years ago.

210
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:31,250
Luckily, it was a small dragon
and the damage was minimal.

211
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,083
But 40 years ago, a massive
black dragon attacked.

212
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,583
The outer wall was breached.

213
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:37,916
[SATOU]
Did the Hero come?

214
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,625
Did he ride in a white horse
and save the day?

215
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:41,666
[ZENA]
No.

216
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,791
It's said that heroes
are summoned

217
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,500
using an ancient
magical ceremony that

218
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,208
the Saga Empire referred
to as the "Hero Summoning."

219
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,666
That's not happened

220
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,333
since the Demon Lord last
appeared some 66 years ago.

221
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,833
I see.

222
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,041
Zena.

223
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,208
When the Demon Lord attacks,
does he summon monsters to help?

224
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,916
I suppose it depends
on the Demon Lord.

225
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,625
Not all of them conjure demons,

226
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,875
but we have faced
down many who do.

227
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,666
It's quite hard to fight
demons because only magic

228
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,875
and magical weaponry
can defeat them.

229
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,000
Wow.

230
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,666
Gotcha.

[BOIDO]
Hear me!

These demi-humans
might not be full demons,

00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,166
but they're made in the
likeness of the Demon Lord!

234

more nefarious goal in mind.

00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,625
We thank you for your kindness.

325
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,375
But please leave us.

326
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,583
[DEMON]
That's much better!

327
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,958
Now that I've shed
that vile human skin,

328
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,416
I'm feeling like myself again!

329
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,166
[SATOU]
No master?

330
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,708
Oh, 'cause Urs died.

331
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,541
In that case!

332
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,583
[DEMON] What a portrait
of humanity this was!

333
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,291
Fear!

334
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:10,875
Worry!

335
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:11,750
Prejudice!

336
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:12,875
Hubris!

337
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,500
It's the stuff nightmares
are made of!

338
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,750
And I love every minute of it!

339
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,958
This place is ripe for
my master's misdeeds!

340
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,500
In fact, it's so perfectly ripe,

341
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:24,041
I'm going to make a nest for
my master right here and now!

342
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,333
Hang on, Satou!

343
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,500
Zena! Look out!

344
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,291
Oh, no!

345
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,125
[DEMON]
Greetings!

346
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,166
Welcome to my master's lair!

347
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,708
It's dark and terrible,

348
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,916
and filled to the
brim with monsters!

349
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,958
Tread carefully!

350
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,583
They eat little
boys for breakfast!

351
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,416
I really hate
that demon's voice.

352
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,125
[DEMON]
I take pleasure in your pain!

353
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,333
It pleases me
to feel your dread!

354
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:06,250
Use the slaves as decoys
and watch them die!

355
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,916
Or you can die yourself!

356
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,416
I'd tell you there's a way out,

357
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,791
but it won't matter cause
you'll never make it that far!

358
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,708
One last thing, monsters
don't always kill you first.

359
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,291
No! They eat you alive!

360
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,875
[SATOU]
So it looks like the mission

361
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,250
is to escape this labyrinth.

362
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,750
This is crazy.

363
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,500
We were in a city adventure
and now we're in the middle

364
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,583
of a freakin' dungeon crawl.

365
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,291
If this was a tabletop RPG,

366
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:32,000
I'd genuinely be worried the
game master had lost his mind.

367
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,791
My name's Satou.

368
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,750
I'm a merchant.

369
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:38,625
I am Cat.

370
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:39,791
I am Dog.

371
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:40,958
And I'm Lizard.

372
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,541
[SATOU]
Are those seriously your names?

373
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,583
Yes, this is what
our master called us.

374
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,208
And you should call us this too.

375
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,208
Uh... I'm sorry,
but that's not gonna happen.

376
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,708
Oh. In that case,

377
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,041
will you provide us with new
names that better suit you?

378
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,875
[SATOU] When it comes
to naming things in a game,

379
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,583
I'm pretty much the worst.

380
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,333
Pochi.

381
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,333
Tama!

382
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,125
Liza!

383
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,208
Thank you very much
for changing our names,

384
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,833
we are forever in
your debt, sir.

385
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,541
[SATOU]
Why are they so excited?

386
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,416
Oh, these are for you.

387
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,666
Use these cloths

388
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,916
and water from the water
pouch to get cleaned up.

389
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,666
There's also ointment you
can apply to your wounds

390
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,458
that will help them heal.

391
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,958
There's plenty to go around,
so please don't be shy.

392
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,375
Oh, don't worry.

393
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,458
I'm not a creeper.

394
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,583
I'm gonna face
the other way, I swear.

395
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,000
You're very kind.

396
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,125
But please don't waste expensive
supplies on mere slaves.

397
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,375
Oh.

398
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,916
You don't need to speak
so gently to us either.

399
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,708
Okay.

400
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,375
Consider it an order, then.

401
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,791
You have to obey, right?

402
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,208
Uh... Yes.

403
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,583
Thank you, Young Master.

404
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:46,625
We will obey.

405
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:47,750
[SATOU]
Awkward.

406
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,625
I've never had
clean clothes before!

407
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,750
Thank you so much!

408
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,250
[SATOU]
They're nice.

409
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,583
[SATOU]
I like them.

410
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,458
They kinda remind of my family.

411
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,250
Heh.

412
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,791
[SATOU]
Hmm...

413
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,208
You don't hafta worry,
guys, just eat up.

414
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,916
So good!

415
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,791
Yes! Sweet and tasty!

416
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,041
Don't rush, take your time.

417
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,375
Huh?

418
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,208
I can't believe I'm actually
eating baked sweets!

419
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,791
[SATOU]
Anyway,

420
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,083
getting out of this cave
is not going to be easy.

421
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,625
I know!

422
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:44,875
[SATOU]
Maps!

423
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,541
Don't leave home without 'em!

424
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,500
[SATOU]
Looks like we've got company.

425
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,041
[SATOU] It's Zena and
the rest of the soldiers.

426
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,791
There's no player chat function.

427
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,500
That would come in handy.

428
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,750
[SATOU]
Also, it's kinda weird

429
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,000
that eyeball demon isn't
coming up on the search.

430
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,416
If we get hit from
both directions

431
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,000
while we're on the move,
we'll be in big trouble.

432
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,208
Don't leave us!

433
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,541
We'll do whatever you want!

434
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,083
Don't go, Master! Please!

435
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,375
Take us with you.

436
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,416
You can use us
as pawns if you like!

437
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,375
Just please, don't abandon us!

438
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,333
[SATOU]
I'm sorry to worry you.

439
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,625
I just wanted to take
a look at the passageway.

440
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,625
I won't leave you girls behind.

442

[POCHI]
Our new master is very kind!

443
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,166
[SATOU] Apparently, Liza's the
only one who has combat skills.

444
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,333
If I take a spear out of
this bag, it'll freak them out.

445
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,208
Take this, Liza.

446
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,500
I am a slave, sir.

447
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,333
It's an order.

448
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,708
Right.

449
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,958
Ladies, I don't want
you to start fighting

450
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,708
unless I order
you to engage.

451
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,208
Now, do I make myself clear?

ahead let me know, all right?

Pochi.

456
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,875
If you smell or hear anything
suspicious, speak up.

458
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,458
You keep an eye on the rear.

459

Make sure to
stay alert, everyone.

461

An enemy.

462
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,166
I smell blood, Master.
It's right in front of us.

463
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,541
That's some nose you've got.

464
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,083
You three just wait right here.

465
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,708
When the main character
in a video game

466
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:41,375
takes on the big bad guy,
it always looks so easy.

467
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,166
I don't know about this.

468
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,666
Maybe it's better to keep
my head down till help comes.

[LIZA]
Young Master?

470
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,083
Please forgive me, but I think
it's best to either slip past

471
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,458
the monster while it's
eating that person?

472
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:56,000
Or to stage a rear assault
while it's properly distracted?

473
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,458
[SATOU] Her level
is in the single digits

474
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:03,000
and even she can figure out
what to do in this situation.

475
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,666
Nice.

476
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,333
Excellent shot, Master!

You're the best.

Don't tell anyone,
about it, okay?

--[POCHI] All right!

486
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,083
[SATOU]
I'll have to remind them

487
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,250
when we get out
of this labyrinth.

488
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,291
[POCHI]
Bye-bye, nasty bug.

489
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,375
[TAMA]
So gross.

490
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:55,458
[SATOU]
Hmm...

491
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,250
In that case...

492
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,875
...there we go.

493
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,083
Liza!

494
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,416
Uh. Yeah, I wouldn't
eat that if I were you.

495
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,416
No, of course not.

496
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,583
The thing is:

497
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,041
I'm trying to get
to the monster's core.

498
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,833
Oh. Here it is.

499
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,458
Wait, what the heck is a core?

500
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,916
[LIZA]
Every monster has one.

501
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,875
They're extremely
valuable commodities.

502
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,708
You can trade them
with merchants at the market

503
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,875
for supplies and
various other items.

504
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,833
[SATOU] That doesn't exactly
answer my question.

505
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,166
Here.

506
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,916
[SATOU]
Right, put it in the bag.

507
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,458
[LIZA]
Understood.

508
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,583
[SATOU]
And this spear is for you.

509
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,458
And now you can have mine.

510
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,333
The chains.

511
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,583
Problem solved.

512
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,791
Sorry about that.

513
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,583
So the next time that we come
across one of those monsters

514
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,250
and kill it, we should let
Pochi and Tama get the core.

515
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,333
When that time comes,
will you teach them how?

516
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,000
[LIZA]
Yes, of course.

517
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,333
Well. Let's go!

518
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,291
Yeah!

519
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,208
Indeed! Let's!

520
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,666
Right!
