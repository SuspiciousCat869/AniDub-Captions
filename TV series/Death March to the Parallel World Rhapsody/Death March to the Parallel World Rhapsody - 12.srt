1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,041
Very well then.

2
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:11,041
I'll keep our deal
and take deliveries

3
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,666
provided they're the same
quality as the witch's brew.

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,291
Even if we manage
to make the potions,

5
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:18,708
it won't matter if we don't
have the vials to store them in!

6
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,125
We'll never make
the delivery in time!

7
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,708
We've been had.

8
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,750
[OWNER]
I do wish I could help you, kid.

9
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,916
But a 180 new vials?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,833
There's just not enough time!

11
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:32,333
We don't want to
drag you into this, sir.

12
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:35,666
If we could just use your kiln,
we'd be grateful.

13
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,791
Are you in danger, kid?

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,166
All right.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,958
I'm not the type to turn
away a stranger in need.

16
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,208
I'll help you as best I can.

17
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:57,875
Thank you, sir.

18
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,500
Well, don't just
stand there, people!

19
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:00,833
Let's get to work!

20
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,958
Right. Liza, Tama,
Pochi, Lulu, and Nana.

21
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,583
I want you to help me make
the vials, whaddaya say?

22
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,041
As you wish.

23
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,625
You bet!

24
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,083
Okie-dokie!

25
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,708
Yes.

26
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,750
I shall do my best, Master!

27
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:19,583
Mia and Arisa.
Help Inenimaana.

28
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,791
Got it.

29
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,666
Well, girls?

30
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,625
Let's go!

31
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,750
[GIRLS]
Right!

32
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:01,583
Waaah! I don't like it!

33
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,333
Uh... No!

34
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,833
No, please stop it!

35
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:11,458
Ugh! I really wish
clay man would stop spinning!

36
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,541
If he keeps turning like this,
I'm gonna sick up!

37
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,416
Uh-oh, I did it wrong.

38
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,250
This is quite frustrating.

39
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,916
Yes, centrifugal force can be
extremely hard to calculate.

40
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,666
That's pretty impressive.

41
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,583
Are you sure you've never
made these before, kid?

42
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:31,458
You're the best!

43
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,375
No one knows how
to make vials like you!

44
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,041
[OWNER]
Yes.

45
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,875
There's one problem, though.

46
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,125
These vials are wet.

47
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,625
It takes five days
for clay like this to dry.

48
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,666
Huh?

49
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,208
But we don't have five days!

50
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,583
[OWNER]
I know.

51
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,416
Listen, I wish I could tell
you there was a shortcut

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,791
or some way around it, but
unfortunately there just isn't.

53
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:55,208
I'm sorry, kids, but this is a
problem I can't help you solve.

54
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,791
[SATOU] Okay. The issue
is the moisture in the clay.

55
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,166
There's gotta be
some way to dry it, right?

56
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,375
Wait!

57
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,291
That's it.

58
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,458
[spell chant]
Clay Wind Dry.

59
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,791
[OWNER]
I didn't know that was possible!

60
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,750
You may be small,
young lady, but you're mighty!

61
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,208
We're in business, people.

62
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,791
Keep on working.

63
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,250
I'll get the vials put
in the kiln right away!

64
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,375
[GIRLS]
Right!

65
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:33,916
[ARISA]
Master!

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,416
The potions are finished!

67
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,291
And we owe it all to you guys!

68
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,125
Thank you!

69
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,375
Well, we're not done quite yet.

70
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,875
The kiln.

71
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,125
I'm just about finished
up over here.

72
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,166
We need to let the vials
cool down a little bit longer,

73
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,250
but they should be ready
before sundown.

74
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,166
I'm so glad we did it!

75
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,666
Oh. Bless you!

76
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,125
[laughs] Oh, wow,
that wasn't a hat at all!

77
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,208
Master.

78
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,416
Might I look after
this odd creature?

79
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,416
Um. I don't think
that's a good idea.

80
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,500
[SATOU]
Witch's familiar?

81
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,958
[DOSAN] What in the hell do
you think you're doing here?

82
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,708
I certainly hope you're not
making vials without permission

83
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,791
because that would
be against the law.

84
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,791
I could arrest you.

85
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,375
[SATOU]
I knew it.

86
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,083
Glad I kept a marker
on this d-bag.

87
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,333
You've got the wrong idea.

88
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,083
I'm just teaching
these folks pottery.

89
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,291
Nothing's for sale!

90
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,375
[DOSAN] What do you
think I am, an idiot?

91
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,583
Sorry, but I'm afraid

92
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,375
we're going to have
to get rid of this kiln.

93
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,750
No don't! Please!

94
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,250
He's innocent!

95
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,750
Innocent, huh?

96
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,625
Oh, I doubt that very much.

97
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,416
Now it's time to pay the price.

98
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,166
Go!

99
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:49,708
It's over.

100
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,541
They destroyed all of them.

101
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,250
[DOSAN] By the way, we're
looking forward to the delivery

102
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,833
of those 300 vials of potion.

103
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,541
Good luck making that deadline!

104
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,291
[laughs]

105
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,625
Kid. I failed you.

106
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,333
Please forgive me.

107
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,583
No. Please forgive me.

108
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,666
Your poor kiln.

109
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,750
If it's all right, I'd like
a moment with my friends.

110
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,041
Yes. Of course.

111
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:21,416
[SATOU]
Listen.

112
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,000
Inenimaana, I have an idea.

113
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,583
Can we use your furry friend
to talk to the witch?

114
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,291
[ARISA]
And we were so close, too!

115
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,916
Wait. Is this even ours?

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,083
[SATOU]
Hmph.

117
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,708
I was worried something
like this might happen.

118
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,958
So I put out a bunch of decoys.

119
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,625
If that's true, then where
are all the ones you made?

120
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,666
Oh, they're safe.

121
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,541
I hid them so well those
jerks will never find them.

122
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,500
Huh?!

123
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,375
I can't explain in detail
right now, but trust me:

124
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,750
I have something way
better than your Item Box.

125
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,708
[ARISA] Hmm...
What do you think,

126
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,875
I'm just gonna nod my head
and take your word for it?

127
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,791
Take 'em out and prove it.

128
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,541
All right.

129
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,500
Huh? Did it break in there?

130
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,666
[SATOU]
Oh, I see.

131
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,000
The sudden change in temperature

132
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,833
must've made it
shatter into pieces.

133
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:35,208
The vials won't do us any good
if we can't take them out.

134
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,500
[SATOU] If there was a way to
gradually change the temperature

135
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,916
I could salvage the rest.

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,125
The only option right now is
to wait for the kiln to be fixed

137
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,333
before taking them out.

138
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,750
[ARISA]
Hmm...

139
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,500
[SATOU] No. We're already
cutting it way too close.

140
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,000
This idea is useless.

141
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,541
Useless?

142
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,250
[SATOU]
Yeah, it's official.

143
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,666
Her storage is definitely weak
sauce compared to my apparatus.

144
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,208
It's useless.

145
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,291
[SATOU]
The flame went out.

146
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,958
Apparently, the stuff in the
Item Box changes over time.

147
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,041
That's it!

148
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,458
Jackpot.

149
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,666
Arisa.

150
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,791
Would you mind taking
a step back, please?

151
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,000
Huh?

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,625
Okay.

153
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:42,083
This'll work!

154
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,125
Now, if I can just combine
it with the Blow Spell!

155
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,208
What do we do?

156
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,416
Girls! Get ready,

157
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,916
'cause we're about to show that
despicable, small-time crook

158
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,458
and his lackey who's boss!

159
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,791
[GIRLS]
Yeah!

160
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:12,750
Who is the boss?

161
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,166
We are!

162
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,500
[SATOU]
Not to be too literal.

163
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,250
But technically, I'm the boss.

164
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,500
[BIRKINZ]
Well, well, well.

165
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,458
Look who it is.

166
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,416
If excuses are all you have,
then save your breath.

167
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,833
I know you don't
have the 300 vials.

168
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,916
The deal is off.

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,291
I beg your pardon, good sir.

170
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,166
This is a delivery receipt.

171
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,375
We'll need
your signature and stamp.

172
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,875
Are you saying you
have the shipment?

173
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,875
It's impossible!

174
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,291
They have delivered the
300 vials of potion, sir.

175
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,541
And we've also confirmed
the legitimacy of this document.

176
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,041
As far as I can tell,
there are no issues.

177
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,708
Kid, what kind of
trick did you use?

178
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,125
What makes you think
that we tricked you?

179
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,166
We just worked hard and figured
it out, and we did it together.

180
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,333
[ARISA]
Mm. Mm.

181
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:10,958
We made good.

182
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,166
Now you do your part.

183
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,083
Sign and seal the document.

184
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,916
Sir. What's wrong?

185
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,625
[SATOU] He can't refuse
to sign it now, can he?

186
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,833
It's nearly sundown, Satou.

187
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,083
Make him sign.

188
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,458
With respect,

189
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,208
I need you to sign
the document immediately.

190
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,875
Allow me to sign it
for you, my friend!

191
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,041
[DOSAN]
Count Kuhanou, sir!

192
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,375
What are you doing here?

193
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,708
[KUHANOU]
I thought you were clever,

194
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,750
yet you can't figure
out the witch told me

195
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,208
of your evil deeds?

196
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,875
Ma'am! You're here, too!

197
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,333
Thank you, Satou!

198
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,750
Bless you!

199
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:03,916
[KUHANOU]
I knew your father.

200
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,125
He was a widely respected man!

201
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,625
We first met at the
Royal Academy years ago.

202
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:10,791
I gave you this position

203
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,250
on account of the
respect I held for him.

204
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,416
For his sake, I honored you.

205
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,958
And you thank me by
spitting it back in my face?

206
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,583
You, sir, do not deserve
to be the assistant viceroy.

207
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,291
As punishment, you are hereby
banished from the kingdom.

208
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,041
May the gods
have mercy upon you!

209
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,666
If you want me
out of this office,

210
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,166
you'll have to force me out!

211
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,875
Careful, sir!

212
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,208
[KUHANOU]
Fear not.

213
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,625
[BIRKINZ]
Spirit of Sedum City.

214
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,791
Attack this enemy of our people!

215
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,375
[spell chant]
Punish him!

216
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,666
[KUHANOU]
You fool.

217
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,250
As the Count of Kuhanou,

218
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:57,000
I could never be harmed by such
a spell within my own territory.

219
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:03,250
The time for mercy is over,
but death is mercy.

220
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,125
Draw your sword
and defend yourself!

221
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,708
[KUHANOU]
Why did you interfere, son?

222
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,333
There are children present.

223
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:35,583
It appears the witch has
a most noble friend in you.

224
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,875
[SATOU]
Sorry for the trouble we caused.

225
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,666
[OWNER]
Are you kidding me?

226
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,041
I got a new kiln, and the
Count promised me priority

227
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,791
on all deals moving forward.

228
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:50,875
'S great!

229
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,083
Thanks to you,
I'm gonna be filthy rich

230
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,333
for the rest of my life!

231
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,125
[laughs]

232
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,541
Mister Satou, from
the bottom of my heart,

233
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:02,333
you have my sincerest thanks
for your aid in this matter.

234
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,458
Here ya go!

235
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,125
A thank you gift!

236
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,625
A lantern?

237
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,666
[INENIMAANA] It's a Magic
Item the mistress and I made.

238
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,041
Hope you like it!

239
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,333
Oh, wow.

240
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,708
This is great.

241
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:13,583
Thanks.

242
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,208
I'll take good care of it.

243
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,875
There's one final gift I want to
give you before we say goodbye.

244
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,000
[SATOU]
Bye, everyone.

245
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,958
I hope to see you soon.

246
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,125
[WITCH]
I wish you and yours

247
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,500
tidings of peace
and joy, Mister Satou.

248
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,291
Well, it's time to go!

249
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,000
'Kay.

250
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,541
Right.

251
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,041
Your wish is our command. 

252
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,375
We're ready, Master.

253
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,000
Okie-dokie!

[TAMA]
Off we go!

255
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,416
[POCHI]
I'm ready for an adventure!

256
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,625
Master. Wake up, please.

257
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,833
Open your eyes.

258
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,666
Come on.

259
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,000
Hurry.

260
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,916
Good morning! Your favorite
girl in the world is here!

261
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,916
[screams]

262
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,916
What the hell?

263
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,791
Impenetrable Barrier!

264
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,500
Go!

265
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,208
Now, please.

266
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,958
Hurry and calibrate
my foundation system,

267
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,250
or I'll shut down.

268
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,166
Huh? So you two weren't
doing something uncouth?

269
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,250
No, of course we weren't.

270
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,125
[ARISA]
Hmph!

271
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,666
You're telling fibs.

272
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,583
No. I swear.

273
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:52,541
Wait a second, you do have the
Magic Manipulation skill, right?

274
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,625
My foundation
instruments are down.

275
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:58,083
As such, I'm unable
to use that skill at this time.

276
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,250
Which is why she needs my help.

277
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,958
Don't worry, Nana,
everything'll be a-okay.

278
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,541
I got you.

279
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,458
Place your hand
near my heart like this

280
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,916
and allow the magic
to flow into me.

281
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,125
I will let you know if any
adjustments are required.

282
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,041
[MIA]
Her back.

283
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,458
Use--her--back.

284
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,750
Right! Yes!

285
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,250
If you only need to
touch her near the heart,

286
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,500
then her back should work
as well as her chest!

287
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,708
Way to save the day, Mia!

288
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,208
Least I could do.

289
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,291
Mia's assessment
is quite correct.

290
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,583
There will be no real
effect on the adjustment

291
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,750
if it is performed
through my back.

292
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,416
Oh! Dear!

293
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,833
Master, please.

294
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,166
Be gentle.

295
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,083
It stings!

296
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,916
Oh. My bad.

297
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,750
Ugh. That's awkward.

298
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,083
[ARISA growls]

299
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:56,791
All I know is this:
I definitely get to go next!

300
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,625
Master, you said to wake you.

301
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,500
Uh. I'm awake.

302
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:06,083
[LIZA] So, Master, what do
you have planned for today?

303
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,125
[POCHI]
Well, Master?

304
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,208
Any idea where
we're headed next?

305
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,000
A dangerous land
called the Muno Barony.

306
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:21,083
How many places have I been
since I first left Seiryuu City?

307
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,375
[LILIO]
Can you believe that?

308
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,083
[ZENA]
Lilio!

309
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:26,791
Huh?

310
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,500
Zena, welcome back!

311
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,333
Why are you I such a hurry?

312
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:34,541
[ZENA pants]

313
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:35,625
Look at this!

314
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,958
Satou wrote a
love letter just for me!

315
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,791
Oh. Wow.

316
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,416
So what does the letter say?

317
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,291
Huh? Hmm...

318
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,458
It says:

319
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,208
"As the lingering winter
leaves us at last,

320
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,791
I sincerely hope the spring
finds you happy and healthy.

321
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,083
It's been a while since I first
left Seiryuu City behind.

322
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,125
I miss all the
lovely people there.

323
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,541
Most of all, I miss seeing you."

324
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,541
Oh please. That doesn't
sound like a love letter to me.

325
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,333
[ZENA]
Huh?!

326
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,125
Ahem.

327
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,541
"We are currently
making our way...

328

[SATOU]
"...through Kuhanou County,

329
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,500
which is just west
of Seiryuu City.

330
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,000
To be honest, this journey has
turned out to be a lot harder

331
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,250
than I thought it would be."

332
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,958
[LULU]
Thirsty? Have some tea.

333
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,125
[SATOU]
Thank you.

334
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,666
Master look.

335
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,416
When we were foraging in the
woods, we acquired some herbs.

336
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,000
What kind of herb is that?

337
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,416
[LIZA]
Uh.

338
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,666
I don't know, but Pochi insisted
we bring it back to you.

339
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,625
It smells so sweet and yummy!

340
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,750
Let me eat it, Master!

341
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,000
Please!

342
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,625
Eat it?

343
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,000
[TAMA]
Take a bite!

344
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,666
Let's break it open first.

345
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,125
[SATOU]
Huh?

346
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,166
It's spilling!

347
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,041
Don't let it go
to waste, Master!

348
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,791
[SATOU]
Not bad.

349
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:59,250
It's grassy, but it's
sweet like sugar cane.

350
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,208
Well.

351
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:02,958
Go on, girls.

352
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,166
Help yourselves.

353
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,250
--[TAMA] Aye, aye!
--[POCHI] Okie-doke!

354

[TAMA]
Yummy!

355
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,541
[SATOU] I didn't mean
for them to lick my fingers.

356
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,500
Master. Here. Take this.

357
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,041
Use it to wipe off your hand.

358
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,333
Right. Thank you, Arisa.

359
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,416
No. Allow me, please.

360
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,916
[SATOU]
Stop it.

361
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,625
Why would you lick me to?

362
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,083
Huh? Cause they got to do it,

363
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,958
and I wanna taste
the wild herb, too.

364
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,750
What's so wrong with that?

365
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,583
If you wanna taste it,
then go find yourself a plate.

366
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,416
Fine.

367
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,041
[SATOU] "The road isn't
for the feint of heart.

368
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,375
It's exhausting.
At the end of the day,

369
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,333
we're so tired we don't
even mind sleeping outside."

370
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,000
Pardon me, Master?

371
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,458
Would you mind reading
us a bedtime story?

372
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,833
Sure. Why not?

373
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,125
[POCHI]
Here, read this!

374
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,625
[SATOU]
I'll do my best.

375
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:03,583
Here goes.

376
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,500
Just don't fall asleep on me.

377
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,833
"Once upon a time,

378
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,000
there were seven deities
who lived in the heavens.

379
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,291
One day, they descended
from their home in the sky

380
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,625
with the World Tree
and came to this place."

381
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:14,833
Master hold on.

382
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:15,708
I don't get it.

383
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,500
What's "seven deities"?

384
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,833
It's just a way of
saying seven gods.

385
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,750
Seven divine beings!

386
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,000
[POCHI]
Well, what's a divine being?

387
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:27,416
[SATOU laughs]
Keep listening.

388
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,750
"But there were two other gods.

389
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,541
The eighth god was a Dragon God.

390
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,333
He actually existed long
before the other seven,

391
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,166
but the Dragon God indulged
in long bouts of deep sleep,

392
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,250
and as he slumbered,
the world changed around him.

393
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,333
The ninth god was a Demon God.

394
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,458
A fearful creature that traveled
here from another world.

395
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,541
The Demon God was very selfish.

396
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:51,458
Concerned only with his
wants, needs, and desires.

397
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,625
As a result,
he could not get along

398
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,708
with the other gods and fought
with them on a regular basis.

399
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,125
His selfishness made it such

400
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,625
that peace seemed nothing
more than a fool's dream.

401
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,333
Demons tormented the
other races of the world.

402
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,958
They seemed to
take particular pleasure

403
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,250
in bedeviling humankind.

404
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,333
The humans called out to their
heroine, the Young Goddess,

405
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,291
asking her for the
power to fight back.

406
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,041
The Young Goddess
heard their prayers

407
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,166
and went to the
other gods for help.

408
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,666
But they would not listen.

409
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,833
Left with no recourse
she took the matter

410
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:25,000
to the strongest of all the
deities: The Dragon God.

411
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,958
At first, the Dragon God was
hesitant, so she coaxed him

412
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:31,291
with humanity's vices:
alcohol and indulgence.

413
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:36,000
Pleased, the Dragon God taught
her one powerful bit of magic.

414
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,916
A divine spell
to summon heroes.

415
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,833
A spell to restore hope." Huh?

416
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:59,083
[SATOU] "I don't know how
this journey will end.

417
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,333
I just know I'm going
to enjoy the adventure.

418
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,083
And when I return,
more than anything else,

419
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,583
I look forward to
seeing you again."

420
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:14,291
So do I, Satou. So much.

421
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,500
[SATOU]
It's morning. Something's on me.

422
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,375
Damn you! You jerk!

423
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,625
If you're gonna
have a slumber party,

424
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,000
the least you could do
is invite me to join!

425
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,333
Pardon me, sir.

426
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,708
I'm sorry to intrude,
but it's breakfast time.

427
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,875
Your food'll get cold.

428
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm so embarrassed, Master.

429
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,625
I don't how I ended up here.

430
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,291
Forgive me! Please!

431
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,291
No one should have to see
me first thing in the morning

432
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,333
before I have a chance
to wash my face!

433
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,291
It's no big deal, Lulu.

434
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,000
To tell ya the truth.

435
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,000
I think you look cute like this.

436
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,791
What? You think I look cute?
