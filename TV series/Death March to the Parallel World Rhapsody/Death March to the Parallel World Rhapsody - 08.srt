1
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,791
[MIZE]
He's here!

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,583
[SATOU]
Psychic Magic?

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,458
His power!

4
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,916
It's overwhelming!

5
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,875
[gasps]

6
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,708
Arisa's fighting back.

7
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,083
[SATOU]
There! The Resistance Skill!

8
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,708
[SATOU]
Zen?

9
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,625
Where've I heard
that name before?

10
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,333
[SATOU]
The hero from that play!

11
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:56,916
[ZEN]
I have come to retrieve you.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,541
Mia.

13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,458
Mr. Sorcerer Man,
glad to meet you.

14
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,083
My name's Satou.

15
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,958
I'm a merchant.

16
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:48,041
[ZEN] Huh? I have no need
for a simple merchant.

17
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:51,166
I'll admit, I'm amazed you can
hold your ground, unshaken,

18
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,291
while withstanding my power.

19
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:56,958
It's impressive, even
for a Hero's descendant.

20
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:57,750
[SATOU]
Wait.

21
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,250
A Hero's descendant?

22
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,916
[ZEN] My intention was
to let you live, but defy me,

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,708
and I will show no mercy.

24
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,083
I'm not really
the violent type, sir.

25
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,000
But Mia's my friend.

26
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,125
If you think I'll let
you steal her away,

27
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,416
you're a bigger fool
than you look.

28
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,875
I think it's time
for you to leave.

29
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,250
[ZEN]
You're the fool.

30
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,458
If you want to protect Mia,
you'll do so by force.

31
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,541
I am not interested
in making peace.

32
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,333
Only in achieving
my purpose here.

33
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,583
Well, have it your way then.

34
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,666
Ahh!

35
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,583
This guy can control shadows.

36
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,833
[ZEN]
Impressive.

37
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,291
Are you a merchant?

38
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,875
Or a martial artist?

39
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:55,541
Either way, for someone at your
level, it's quite impressive.

40
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:56,833
I'm impressed, too.

41
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,291
I never met a sorcerer
who can move shadows.

42
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,750
So we're even.

43
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,750
[ZEN] In spite of your doom,
you run your mouth still.

44
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,041
What a courageous spirit.

45
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,541
Get your damn hands off
my master, you creep!

46
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,208
A wraith!

47
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,416
[ZEN]
How dare you insult me, slave?

48
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,583
I am no wraith.

49
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,250
No low-level undead minion!

50
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,208
[SATOU]
This oughta do the trick!

51
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,833
[gasps]

52
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,541
[ZEN]
No!

53
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,916
No! It's simply not possible!

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Nothing in this world
should be able to interact

55
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:40,625
with the power of my Shadow
Whip except a magic item!

56
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,125
We can beat this guy!

57
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,875
No. Just run.

58
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,875
[ARISA] You really think I'd
leave you behind and run away?

59
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,375
I'm not trying to protect you
because we're friends.

60
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,041
I'm doing it because my master
wants to keep you safe.

61
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,125
What my master wants,
my master gets!

62
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,125
Always!

63
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,041
Yes, but--

64
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,625
There're no buts about it!

65
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,500
We're saving you, Mia,
no matter what you say!

66
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,666
[SATOU]
Is she about to use magic?

67
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,708
Hold on.

68
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,166
Sorcerer.

69
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,041
You already know who we are.

70
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,625
It's only fair for you
to tell us, too.

71
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,708
Although, it's pretty
obvious already.

72
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,083
The highest rank of the undead.

73
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,916
An Undead King.

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,625
[ZEN] Hmm...
You say you're a merchant,

75
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,708
yet you fight like
a martial artist.

76
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,583
And now you wield that
like a veteran gunman.

77
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,083
Oh, I've got plenty
of tricks up my sleeve.

78
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,875
[ZEN]
Yes, indeed you do, Satou.

79
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:39,208
Shall we add "hero"
to your many identities?

80
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,583
Master, quickly!

81
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,375
Jump out of the way!

82
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,583
[ZEN gasps]

83
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:02,000
[pants]

84
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,916
[ZEN]
That was certainly a close one.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
To think she'd
have a unique skill.

86
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,291
[ZEN]
And that hair color.

87
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:14,083
It seems you're
reincarnated as well.

88
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,625
I tried, Master.

89
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,541
[SATOU]
It's not working at all.

90
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,875
[ZEN] Strength beyond one's
capacity brings only ruin.

91
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,041
If you would keep
her from becoming

92
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,791
a plaything for the gods,

93
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,791
then you should keep her
from using that unique skill.

94
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,416
Thanks for the advice, pal.

95
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,083
[ZEN]
You're quite welcome.

96
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,458
I shall take my leave now.

97
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,250
Huh?

98
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,416
[ZEN]
It's useless.

99
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,000
To defeat one who
has transcended nature,

100
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,833
you must possess the means to
defy the laws of nature itself!

101
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,333
No! Satou!

102
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,916
[SATOU]
Mia!

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,583
[ZEN] If you truly have no fear
of death, then visit the Cradle.

104
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,541
It would give me immense
pleasure to see you

105
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,041
push your wisdom and
courage to their limits,

106
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,708
in an attempt to strike me down.

107
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:00,791
Master!

108
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,958
Are you hurt?

109
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,375
No, I'm okay!

110
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,000
The others need your help now!

111
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,250
Go get Zena as
quickly as you can!

112
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,916
Mia's in trouble!

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,791
I have to follow them
and bring her back!

114
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,916
[SATOU] My stamina is starting
to drain a little bit at a time.

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,250
Mia. Where is she?

116
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,791
[SATOU]
Huh?

117
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,375
[SATOU]
Hmmm...

118
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,291
[SATOU]
Hmmm...

119
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:56,333
[SATOU]
Hmmm... Hmm...

120
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,416
I'm coming, Mia!

121
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:09,875
[ZEN]
No!

122
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,000
No! It's simply not possible!

123
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:15,500
How did you manage to escape
the abyss of my shadow prison?

124
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,375
Against the daunting oppression
of its endless nothingness,

125
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,541
you should
have been powerless!

126
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,958
[SATOU]
What a weirdo.

127
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,416
I can never tell if he's
shocked or impressed with me.

128
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,708
Well, I keep a small amulet.

129
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,875
So your magic doesn't work.

130
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,750
[ZEN] Trials must be
administered with fairness.

131
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,250
There are no grounds
for cheating.

132
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,083
Only someone who
has conquered the Cradle

133
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,750
should have the ability
to reach this room.

134
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,625
Those are the rules.

135
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,250
What're you, the game master?

136
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,666
[ZEN]
You insult me!

137
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,500
My Cradle is no game!

138
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,208
It is a formidable test!

139
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:52,583
Only a proper hero can conquer
its power and reach this room.

140
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,083
Only a hero with true
substance can do battle

141
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,583
with the Undead King!

142
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,833
[SATOU] Is he trying to say
I don't have the goods?

143
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,375
[ZEN laughs]

144
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,416
As long as I bear the
gift of God's blessing,

145
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,166
I can never perish
from this world.

146
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,166
[SATOU] I gotta get
Mia out of here fast.

147
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,541
[ZEN]
Nice try.

148
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,208
But if you want
to get to the end,

149
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,041
you must first start
at the beginning.

150
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,458
[sighs]
Oh boy. This sucks.

151
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,791
[ZEN]
You insult me!

152
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,708
My Cradle is no game!

153
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,083
It is a formidable test!

154
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:50,083
[SATOU] "The Cradle"? He shoulda
called it the "Big Ass Tree."

155
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,250
I'm guessing
Mia is somewhere inside.

156
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,458
Wow.

157
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,458
This place is right next to
Count Seiryuu's territory.

158
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,750
That's good news.

159
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,500
After I get to the
top and rescue Mia,

160
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,541
getting home won't
be a guessing game.

161
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,083
[SATOU]
What is this?

162
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:17,500
Looks like there's an
explanation in Elvish.

163
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,875
"Caution.

164
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,000
As this is an institute
for Elvish martial training,

165
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:24,541
the life support mechanisms
will only work on other elves.

166
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,791
There are no
restrictions upon whom

167
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,583
may enter the
training grounds.

168
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,125
But do so at your own peril.

169
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,708
The management here is
not responsible for any injury

170
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,625
or loss of property
incurred during use."

171
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,125
Weird. Hmm...

172
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,250
[sighs]

173
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,166
Going in is a risky move.

174
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,083
But Mia needs my help,
so I don't have a choice.

175
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,958
[SATOU]
Uh-oh.

176
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,000
Looks like I got company.

177
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,541
[SATOU]
This place is no joke.

178
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,916
There are 200 floors.

179
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,750
They're arranged
in groups of ten.

180
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,000
Every 20 floors,

181
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,000
a massive spiral staircase
stretches upward.

182
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,166
There are monsters stationed
in front of each access point

183
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,333
to the stairway.

184
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:17,125
If I had to guess, I'd bet they
get stronger the higher you get.

185
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,000
Compared to the Devil's
Labyrinth under Seiryuu City.

186
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,083
This Cradle feels a lot more

187
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,333
like a traditional
gaming experience.

188
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,375
It's crazy. It's exactly what
someone who's a fan of RPGs

189
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,166
for home consoles
would come up with.

190
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,625
In that case,

191
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,958
I should focus
on the first ten floors

192
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,541
and keep an eye
out for monsters.

193
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,208
[SATOU]
There.

194
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,375
Stop hiding and come out!

195
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,500
[DRYAD]
Shut up, you dum-dum!

196
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,250
[yawns]

197
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:55,916
I'm super annoyed because
I don't have enough MP!

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,416
[SATOU]
Perfect.

199
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,791
If I defeat her, she'll be
forced to open up a passageway

200
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,791
to the upper floors
and I'll get to the top faster.

201
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,416
If a classic dungeon crawler
fan designed this place,

202
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,875
there's bound to
be a portal setup

203
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,250
or a shortcut gimmick
around here somewhere.

204
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,583
Sorry, I'm too tired to fight.

205
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:13,041
I don't really see
how that's my problem.

206
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,250
[DRYAD groans]

207
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,541
Listen here, ya big jerk!

208
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,250
Back off or
I'll tell Toya on you!

209
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,208
Huh?

210
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,000
[SATOU]
Uh. Oh no.

211
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,333
Be mine forever, human!

212
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,041
Huh? I'm flattered,
but if you wanna propose,

213
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,791
you're gonna have
to wait 14 to 15 years.

214
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:33,625
I'm starving!

215
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,041
I want some food!

216
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,125
[SATOU] Hmm...
Well, I do have a little jerky.

217
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,208
Not human food, I want MP!

218
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,833
Right now!

219
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,583
[SATOU] Sorry,
but I need the MP for myself.

220
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,875
[DRYAD]
It only hurts for a little bit.

221
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,250
You'll feel much
better after, I swear!

222
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,583
Smooches!

223
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,333
I feel better!

224
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,291
[SATOU]
That wasn't your fault, Satou.

225
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,458
Think of it like a bee sting.

226
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,083
I don't want that title.

227
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,958
Can I give it back maybe?

228
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,583
[DRYAD] As thanks, I'll open
up the corridor for you!

229
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,500
It's all yours!

230
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,125
[SATOU]
Huh?

231
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,250
Trazayuya's room?

232
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,291
All righty then.

233
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,250
Here goes nothing.

00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,708
Uh. Thank you?

235
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,958
[SATOU]
A laboratory?

236
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm guessing this Trazayuya
character created the Cradle?

237
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,833
Is that who the Dryad
was talking about

238
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,083
when she said "Toya"?

239
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,125
[TRAZAYUYA] "We elves have such
a slight attachment to life.

240
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,458
When faced with life
or death situations,

241
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,500
strangely, we have
little will to struggle.

242
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,958
Because of that weakness,

243
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:49,416
many of our young have
died within the labyrinth.

244
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,958
The Cradle was
created for one purpose:

245
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,041
to instill in Elvenkind a
strong will to survive even

246
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,125
in the face of grave danger.

247
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,416
It seems that in
a hundred years,

248
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,041
no one has forgotten
about my greatest failure.

249
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:08,083
Soon, my long life
will come to an end at last.

250
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,333
As such, I will
seal this place away

251
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,750
until the day my
fellow elves find it useful.

252
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,541
[SATOU] I have faith
that elves will once again

253
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,916
lead the many
races of this world.

[SATOU] He's of the same lineage
as Mia and the manager.

That's why this place needs her.

257
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,541
Well. Too bad.

00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:29,250
Oh, joy.

I'm looking for
a little help here.

00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:34,958
Is there a portal?

00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,541
[DRYAD]
Sure is!

264
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,916
All you have to do is stand in
the middle of that fairy ring!

Where exactly do you wanna go?

00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,208
The top floor.

267
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,250
I need to see the Cradle Master.

268
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,000
That's not gonna happen, buddy!

269

No way!

The guardian on
that floor is pretty tough!

Before we fight.

I need a moment please.

00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,666
[SATOU] Aren't homunculi
supposed to be some sort

00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,916
of artificial intelligence made
through the power of alchemy?

If that face is any indication,

I'm pretty sure these
models were based on Mia.

My congratulations on
making it this far, Voyager.

If you wish to continue onward,

297
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,166
you must first defeat
the mighty guardian

who protects these
chamber walls.

All victors will be
granted recompense

Use body strengthening
and split up.

the famous tale of the golem.

guardian's weakness!

313

This is why I suggested
we not leave

314

a conspicuous clue
written on his helmet!

315
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,916
Upon further reflection,

316
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,375
that does seem like
an obvious mistake.

00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,541
Only in lieu of the
phrase "make a run for it,"

324
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,458
I would say, "Commence retreat."

325
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:31,125
[SATOU] I guess the one with
side buns is the editor bot?

326
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,583
Fire! Strike! Now!

327
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,500
What am I supposed to do now?

328
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,333
I can't just gut
punch an A.I. lady

329
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,875
and leave her all on her own.

330
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,416
No. That's wrong.

331
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,208
So wrong.

332
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,166
There're all kinds of
weapons and potions here.

333
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,416
Pretty pricey stuff, too.

334
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,291
I'll help myself.

335
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,958
[NUMBER 7]
Master.

336
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,833
Master.

337
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,666
Sorry I failed you.

338
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,000
Master!

339
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,708
Oh, wow.

340
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,916
This looks like the
room the Dryad was in.

341
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,166
Maybe this'll help get her back
to one hundred percent again.

342
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,166
[DRYAD]
Water!

343
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,750
Now! Hand over the MP!

344
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,291
Aha!

345
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,125
You gave some to the other me
that was down below!

346
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,458
There's another you?

347
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,041
Yes, they're all me!

348
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,458
You humans are weird, the way
you're all separate individuals!

349
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,000
Plant and spirit folk like me?

350
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,666
We're all connected!

351
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,750
Though we lose contact
when we're low on MP!

352
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,250
[SATOU] Hey, would you
be willing to help me

353
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,166
get to the top?

354
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,250
Yeah! Sure!

355
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,083
Just give me one second!

356
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:37,083
[DRYAD]
Hmm?

357
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,750
It would seem the line
connecting us has been severed!

358
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,083
Sorry!

359
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,083
Right now you can only
get up to the 180th floor!

360
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,333
Oh, thanks.

361
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,166
That's great!

362
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,041
[DRYAD]
You got it, pal!

363
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,791
Oh, gross.

364
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,208
I think bugs ate
through the connection.

365
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,250
The next staircase is ahead.

366
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,291
Well, that was intense.

367
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,875
[ZEN] I never imagined
you would make it this far

368
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,458
in such a short period of time.

369
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,750
Same here.

370
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,958
I'll make you a deal, Skeletor.

371
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,791
Hand over the girl and you live.

372
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,375
[ZEN]
No.

373
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,875
You may have earned the right
to fight me by making it here.

374
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,958
But I'm afraid you lack the
credentials to face me.

375
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,375
If you truly wish to
claim the title of Hero,

376
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,333
there is one more challenge
you must overcome first:

377
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,291
You will fight
a dangerous enemy,

378
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,833
an enemy you have
no chance of defeating.

379
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,041
Your reward will be

380
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,791
this once lost,
ancient sword: Gjallarhorn!

381
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,041
Dangling a carrot
for me, are ya?

382
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,541
[ZEN]
Indeed.

383
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,416
If you were to hand over this
coveted sword to any king,

384
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,625
he would reward you

385
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,916
with glory beyond your
wildest imagination.

386
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,375
[SATOU] I can't figure out
what his angle is.

387
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,625
[ZEN] It's time for you
to meet your opponents,

388
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,083
Merchant Warrior.

389
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,416
[SATOU]
Seven homunculi.

390
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,291
I see two of the ones from
before, Numbers 5 and 6.

391
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,208
But where's Number 7?

392
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,708
She's not here.

393
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,291
[ZEN] A true Hero lives outside
the boundaries of safety.

394
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,416
He exists beyond the fine
line between life and death.

395
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,541
Thus, allow me to bestow you all
with God's miraculous blessing.

396
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,875
[SATOU]
Some kind of buff magic?

397
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,833
Oh no.

398
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:56,791
[ZEN] I do hope to see a
suitable battle to the death.

399
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,000
[SATOU]
Mia.
