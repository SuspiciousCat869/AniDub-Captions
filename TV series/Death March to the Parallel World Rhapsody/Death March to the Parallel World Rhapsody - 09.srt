1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:12,291
[ZEN] I do hope to see a
suitable battle to the death.

2
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:13,666
[SATOU]
Mia!

3
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,375
[SATOU]
All right!

4
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:11,458
Activate!

5
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,041
[SATOU]
I don't get it.

6
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,958
Why fight so hard for a master
who treats you like pawns?

7
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,458
You're wrong.

8
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,958
We're not the pawns.

9
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,625
You are.

10
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,500
[SATOU]
This is not good.

11
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,291
[SATOU]
One more.

12
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,333
[SATOU]
She has to know she can't win.

13
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,041
My master's wish.

14
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,250
Please make it
come true for him.

15
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,541
You must promise us this.

16
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,416
[ZEN]
Magnificent!

17
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,583
Truly magnificent!

18
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:21,250
Now you've earned the right
to be here, Mister Hero.

19
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,500
Mister Sorcerer.

20
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,583
Or wait.

21
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,583
Undead King.

22
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,791
Whoever you are.

23
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,666
You wanna tell me
about this wish?

24
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,375
[ZEN] It would be
my pleasure, young sir.

25
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:43,250
I wish to find a Hero who will
do me the service of killing me.

26
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,625
In my past life,

27
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,833
I met my end at the
hands of an unjust brutality.

28
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:52,500
God, in his wisdom, saw fit
to reincarnate me as an infant.

29
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,458
I was born into a highly
respectable family.

30
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,416
I even found a companion.

31
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,541
She was too good for me,
but I loved her dearly.

32
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,875
Life was good,
but I was a fool.

33
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,916
I naively believed my new life

34
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,583
would meet an entirely
different end from my last.

35
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:14,541
But unfortunately, God had
other plans in mind for me.

36
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,208
A noble fell in
love with my wife.

37
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:22,500
He imprisoned me and had me
executed on false pretenses.

38
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,083
He didn't stop there.

39
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,958
In the end, the heads of every
member of my family were strewn

40
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,250
about the castle grounds.

41
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,333
Among them,
the corpse of my wife,

42
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:36,750
cast aside like a rag doll,
like she was nothing.

43
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,500
[ZEN] I turned my wife and the
rest of my family into undead.

44
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,458
Hungry for sweet vengeance,
I bore my teeth

45
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,625
and unleashed holy hell on
the noble and his kinsman.

46
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,791
It was said they were
a resilient family,

47
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,250
but in the end, we prevailed.

48
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,833
Having accomplished my revenge,

49
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,916
I sought a means to end my life

50
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,750
and rejoin my
dearest wife in death.

51
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:03,375
But God's blessing would
not allow me to do so.

52
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,416
I tried everything,
even the power of Undead

53
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,583
and the Holy Sword,
but nothing worked.

54
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,708
After all,

55
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,791
God made me the
immortal King of Night.

56
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,375
He granted me a body
that would never die

57
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,375
and a soul that would
forever yearn for justice.

58
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:24,541
And the might to fight all
undue displays of power.

59
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,583
Now, "Hero,"
I have told you my story.

60
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,333
Before I fully descend
into the darkness,

61
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,666
use that sword
to strike me down!

62
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,458
My master has a wish.

63
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,500
Please make it come true.

64
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,041
[ZEN]
You have my gratitude, friend.

65
00:06:56,125 --> 00:07:00,500
[laughs]

66
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,041
Darling!

67
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,750
My dearest love.

68
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,375
My sweetest one.

69
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,541
This time

70
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,458
we'll be together forever!

71
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,458
[VOICE A laughs]
What a failure!

72
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,000
[VOICE B]
Yes! A failure indeed!

73
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,125
[VOICE A]
Goodbye, Hero.

74
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,583
You win this time.

75
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:33,041
[laughs]

76
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,125
We'll meet again!

77
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,125
[VOICE B]
Goodbye!

78
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What was that?

00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,166
[MIA]
Hmmm? Huh?

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,125
Don't worry, there's no

Hey.

96
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,875
Do you have any idea
how to turn that off?

97
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,541
[MIA]
I'll try.

98
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,083
I failed.

99
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,125
Jeez, you gave up fast!

100
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,541
Done!

101
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,541
[MIA]
We're safe?

102
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,375
Uh. Yeah.

103
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,583
Well, sort of.

104
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,791
We're not in the clear just yet.

105
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:36,541
It doesn't look like Zen ever
intended to sacrifice Mia.

106
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,125
He even has a clear
method of escape

107
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,750
built into the architecture
of the program.

108
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:45,083
But every other function
seems to be blocked out.

109
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,958
If I stick close to her,
in theory,

110
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,791
we should be able
to warp out together.

111
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,041
But wait.

112
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,875
What'll happen to
the homunculi if I leave?

113
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,416
Number 7 is still on
one of the bottom floors.

114
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,375
I can't just abandon her!

115
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,333
Mia. Listen to me.

116
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,458
There's someone down
below who needs my help.

117
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,541
It's not safe!

118
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,916
Don't worry, I'm not gonna die!

119
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,041
I promise.

120
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,875
A promise is a promise, Satou.

121
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,291
So no matter what, you'd better
come back here alive!

122
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,791
I'll make it back,
you have my word!

123
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,291
I better move.

124
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,291
I have a promise to keep!

125
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,416
Huh?

126
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,750
There!

127
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,583
Salty!

128
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,541
Is this place turning into salt?

129
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,375
There! Number 7!

130
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,208
Green Girl!

131
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,833
You rang?

132
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,666
[SATOU] I need you to transport
us outside the tree, stat!

133
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,041
I think I can
establish a connection

134
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,250
and get you near the bottom,

135
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,791
but I'm gonna need
you to load me up

136
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,708
with delicious seeds first!

137
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,208
Just seeds?

138
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,375
You don't care which kind?

139
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,708
Nope!

140
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,625
As long as it's plant seed,
it'll do the trick!

141
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,958
[SATOU]
Here. Is this enough?

142
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,708
No dum-dum, not even close.

143
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,791
For this to work, I'll need
three times what I got before.

144
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,750
You won't have any MP left.

145
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,250
[SATOU]
Whatever! It's fine!

146
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,583
Yay!

147
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,416
[DRYAN]
Smooches!

148
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,333
Ahhh...

149
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,125
I'm synched and ready to roll!

150
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:47,791
Well!

151
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,375
Let's go!

152
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,916
Thanks a lot.

153
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,458
Oh, it was my pleasure,
and that MP really hit the spot.

154
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,750
Well, Hero Man.

155
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:03,666
You'd better bolt!

156
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,958
[SATOU]
Bolt?

157
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,083
[SATOU]
It's a tidal wave of salt!

158
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:14,791
Quick! Run!

159
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,083
Oh no, I'm safe.

160
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,916
As long as there
are trees I'm okay!

161
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,583
Thank you.

162
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,250
Good luck.

163
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,041
I need to activate
the transport skill

164
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,083
I haven't even touched yet.

165
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,916
It's much easier to run now!

00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,375
Hey, you helped me buy this
cart, and that's no small thing.

330
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,000
Watch over Mia.

331
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:36,958
[SATOU]
I will.

332
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:37,958
I promise.

333
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,791
Be careful out there.

334
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,250
The roads are crawling
with bandits

335
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,166
and lots of shady rogues.

336
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,500
[YUNI]
Hang on!

337
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,125
Here.

338
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,625
I wanted to give you your gifts!

339
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,291
These look really good!

340
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,291
We're both starving, too!

341
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,958
Can't wait to dig in!

342
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,083
No, don't eat it.
It's a necklace.

343
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,000
[POCHI]
Oh! Really?

344
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,000
[TAMA]
That's disappointing.

345
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,500
[POCHI]
But it looks so delicious!

346
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,458
[ZENA]
Satou, wait!

347
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,083
[SATOU]
Zena?

348
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,125
[ZENA]
Glad I wasn't too late.

349
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,625
Yeah, me too.

350
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,583
I was hoping we'd
get a proper goodbye.

351
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,958
[ZENA] There's something
I need to say to you.

352
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,458
Satou.

353
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,958
You're so great, and I wish
that I could come with you.

354
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,291
But I can't just
abandon my family.

355
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,125
I love them, too.

356
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,958
I want to join you. I do.

357
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,625
But I just can't.

358
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,250
That said, this spring,

359
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,125
my brother will officially
become the head of our family.

360
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,625
I've spoken to him,

361
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:02,583
and as far as he's concerned,
I'm free to do as I like.

362
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,333
And so,

363
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,166
I have good news.

364
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:24,125
[ZENA] When Spring comes,
I'll be able to join you!

365
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,083
[ARISA]
Don't look so blue, Master.

366
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,375
I know you'll miss Zena,
but at least you've got us.

367
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,125
Does your tummy hurt?

368
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,791
Are you gonna throw up?

369
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,000
Satou?

370
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,416
I'll be all right.

371
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,750
Sir.

372
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,250
I read in one of my
old master's code libraries

373
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,458
that crying into a woman's
chest will make you feel better!

374
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,625
Hey! No. Fair!

375
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,041
Cut that out right now!

376
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,375
Lulu, do something!

377
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,125
Quick!

378
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,250
[LULU]
No, Arisa.

379
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,375
I'm driving the cart.

380
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,416
I have to focus on the road.

381
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,458
[VOICE B]
Don't forget.

382
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,125
We'll be together.

383
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,500
Forever.
