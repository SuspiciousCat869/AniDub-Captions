1
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:13,458
[SATOU] I guess they don't get
skills just by being with me.

2
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,000
There're no changes on
their experience bars.

3
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,500
Huh.

4
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:18,833
Tama.

5
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,791
Go find us some stones
about the size of a core!

6
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,500
'Kay!

7
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,291
There's a bug up ahead!

8
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,583
I got him!

9
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:32,333
Tama!

10
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,416
Let it rip!

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,375
Yeah!

12
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,708
Pochi, Tama, get back a bit!

13
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,166
Liza, when you see an
opening, stab him in the gut!

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,708
Right!

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,583
Liza, Tama.

16
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,250
Now you go retrieve the core!

17
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,958
And Pochi, you come with me!

18
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,750
There're more bugs up ahead!

19
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,041
Jeez.

20
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,083
That's a lot of rocks.

21
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,875
Pochi.

22
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,583
Take the rocks and
throw them at the bug's side.

23
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,416
But stay on the move,
and then try to hide somewhere.

24
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,041
Right.

25
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,458
Okie-dokie.

26
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,125
Huh?

27
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,208
[POCHI]
Liza! Tama!

28
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,750
Don't let the big
nasty bug eat me...

29
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,583
[SATOU]
Pochi! Wait! Come back!

30
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,916
[screams]

31
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,208
That wasn't part of the plan.

32
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,250
Is Pochi all right?

33
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,541
What's wrong?

34
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,916
Is she hurt?

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,833
Oh, no, she's okay.

36
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,458
She just got scared, that's all.

37
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,416
We should get going.

38
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,166
[POCHI]
I'm so sorry, Master.

39
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,250
[SATOU]
I'm not mad at her.

40
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,625
I'm just worried
she's gonna get hurt

41
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,041
if she freaks out like that.

42
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,458
Pochi,

43
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,041
when things get dicey,
it's okay to run away sometimes.

44
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,000
But you still gotta
keep a cool head.

45
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,041
Understand?

46
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,541
Right. Okie-doke.

47
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,583
[SATOU]
I don't like "tamer."

48
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,541
If it were up to me,
I'd go with "patient educator."

49
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,208
[SATOU] Awesome! Their
levels are starting to go up!

50
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,375
I guess you get
skills automatically

51
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,666
when your level increases.

52
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,833
Master, we're finished.

53
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,583
We've collected
all of the cores.

54
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,833
[SATOU]
Cool.

55
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,041
Huh.

56
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,666
She's not calling me
"Young Master" anymore.

57
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,750
Is it weird if I say I miss it?

58
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,666
[SATOUR] She doesn't
have much stamina left.

59
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,541
Hey!

60
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,625
I think we should take a break.

61
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,541
What kind of food do we have?

62
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:25,833
Oh wow!

63
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,291
This is really good!

64
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,250
It's the best!

65
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,083
Meat is the greatest food ever!

66
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,166
[LIZA] When you bite into
the succulent, tender jerky

67
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,875
the flavors explode in
your mouth like canon fire!

68
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,250
[SATOU] When you're done eating,
you should get some sleep.

69
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,416
Would you like me
to set up camp, Master?

70
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,916
[SATOU]
Hmm...

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,833
No, just get some rest.

72
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,458
Hey! Awesome job!

73
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,166
Right!

74
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,333
--Yay!
--Thank you!

75
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,333
[SATOU] It's the first time
I've let them take the reigns.

76
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,666
But they handled
it like old pros.

77
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,625
[LIZA]
Master.

78
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,083
I want to start a fire.

79
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,166
Is that all right?

80
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,333
Why a fire?

81
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,625
[LIZA] Well, I was
thinking I would like

82
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,291
to prepare some frog meat.

83
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,625
Forgive me.

84
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,125
There's no need to
forgive you, but, "frog meat"?

85
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,625
[LIZA]
It's quite delicious.

86
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,958
But if not cooked properly,
we could fall deathly ill.

87
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,458
Okay, why not?

88
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:47,833
[LIZA]
Here, Master.

89
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:48,541
[SATOU]
Oh, wow.

90
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,958
Thanks.

91
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,166
I hope I don't puke.

92
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,541
Not bad.

93
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,000
It tastes like chicken.

94
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,000
Probably because of the
seasoning salt she used.

95
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,833
Huh? Why aren't
they chowing down?

96
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,500
Please, don't wait for me.

97
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,875
If I were you,

98
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,666
I'd go ahead and dig
in while the frog's still hot.

99
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,458
Hot meat!

100
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,791
Piping hot!

101
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:27,500
[SATOU sighs]

102
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,750
If we keep this pace up,

103
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,000
we'll find our way out
of this crazy labyrinth

104
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,541
in no time at all.

105
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:36,250
But once we do,
what happens to them?

106
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,250
Here goes nothing.

107
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,833
Fire Ball Attack!

108
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,291
Uh-oh.

109
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,708
I guess that fire shot spell
isn't gonna get the job done

110
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,666
against a level 10 slime.

111
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,166
[LIZA]
If I may,

112
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,833
the most effective way to
defeat a purple slime monster

113
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,791
is to penetrate its core.

114
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,666
It works every single time.

115
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,916
Slime. Gross.

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,791
It turned into
a puddle of nasty.

117

Huh? That wall is weird.

118

[SATOU]
A hidden door?

119
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,000
Or a trap?

There's a battle just
down this corridor, Master!

168
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,958
We'll go ahead and
see what's happening.

169
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,791
Follow slightly behind us
and make sure nothing tries

170
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,625
to attack from the rear.

171
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,041
Tama! Pochi! I need a torch!

172
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,833
--Meow!
--Okay!

173
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,875
Distract the slime monsters

174
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,791
and try to lure them
away from the troops!

175
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,750
Liza, aim for the cores
and take them out!

176
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,250
Once they're dead,
I want you to run back here

177
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,708
as fast as you can, okay?

178
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,875
[GIRLS agree]

179
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,041
I'm a hundred times stronger

180
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,750
than those stupid
little demi-freaks!

181
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:45,125
As long as I have this
sword, I'll be just fine!

182
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,083
[roars]

183
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,666
We showed them who's boss!

184
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,958
Darn right we did!

185
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,500
Excellent job, ladies.

186
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,541
Huh...?

187
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,875
[SATOU]
Zena!

188
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,166
Are you okay?

189
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,791
It really is you!

190
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:42,791
Huh?

191
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:43,708
Oh, Satou!

192
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,000
I was so worried about you!

193
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,666
[ORNA]
Zena.

194
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,791
This isn't the time
to celebrate.

195
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,750
I think it's best we take care
of the monsters first.

196
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,083
[ZENA]
Priestess Orna.

197
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,000
[ORNA] Judging by
what I've just witnessed,

198
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,166
I take it you've determined

199
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,000
where the slime monsters'
weakness lies.

200
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,250
Yes.

201
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,041
All you have to do is
penetrate their cores,

202
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,166
and they disintegrate.

203
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,666
How'd you figure
that out, Satou?

204
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,916
You're so smart.

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,291
No. Liza is the
smart one, not me.

206
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,000
Who?

207
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,666
Is Liza your girlfriend?

208
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,250
Ask if he's been
unfaithful later, dear.

209
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,375
[SATOU]
Unfaithful?

210
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,416
Oh, I get it.

211
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,291
She doesn't
understand who Liza is.

212
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,208
Well, I'm just happy
you're safe, Satou.

213
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,750
Yeah, these three are the
only reason I'm safe at all.

214
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,791
[ZENA]
Oh!

215
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,291
You mean the
demi-humans from before.

216
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,041
[POCHI]
My name's Pochi and this is...

217
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,208
[TAMA]
...Tama.

218
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,208
[SATOU]
Huh.

219
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,416
I didn't know they were so shy.

220
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,833
[LIZA]
My name is Liza.

221
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,791
You saved us from
being stoned to death.

222
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,916
We are in your debt.

223
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,750
You're nice!

224
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,458
Like really, really nice!

225
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,625
Heh! You're nice, too.

226
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,500
[TAMA]
Huh?

227
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,875
Master, that wall.

228
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,500
It's weird, too.

229
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,250
[SATOU]
Another hidden door.

230
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,625
And it looks like
it's right above the spot

231
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,333
where we defeated
that undead beast.

232
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,916
Good work, Tama.

233
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,166
[SOLDIER A]
Look. It's a treasure box!

234
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,083
[SOLDIER B]
Back off, it's mine!

235
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,166
I found it!

236
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,875
[DEMON]
Ha! I'm back!

237
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,708
[DEMON] I didn't think
so many of you would come!

238
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,500
The more the merrier!

239
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,166
I'd say this labyrinth
just got a lot less cool!

240
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,958
[SOLDIER C]
Everyone, take your positions!

241
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,416
Attack from all sides!

242
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,291
But be careful:
This demon can use magic!

243
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,791
Viscount, provide defensive
cover for the men in front!

244
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,583
You made a mistake, demon!

245
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,166
You should've stayed
hidden inside of your chest.

246
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,083
You can't fend off
my fire magic.

247
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,791
So I'll use Blast Pole!

248
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:53,208
[DEMON laughs]

249
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,416
Human spells are so slow!

250
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,166
I'm bored out of my mind!

251
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,041
[SATOU]
What is this sensation?

252
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,625
Huh?

253
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,500
I've never seen
anything like this!

254
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,166
Would you look
at all of that meat?

255
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,083
There's enough to feed an army!

256
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,583
Pochi, Tama!

257
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,208
Let's gather as much food
for Master as we possibly can!

258
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,750
[SATOU]
What the hell is going on?

259
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,000
Do the soldiers look like
roast chicken to them?

260
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,291
I need to snap them
out of this fast!

261
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,583
[DEMON]
You humans are such fools!

262
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll watch with delight as
you rip each other to shreds!

263
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,250
Demon.

264
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,791
If you think we're going
to let you defeat us

265
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:35,083
without putting up a fight,
then the only fool here is you!

266
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,208
Blast Pole!

267
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,375
[DEMON laughs]

268
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,000
[gasps]

269
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,916
What? No way!

270
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,958
Mid-level magic doesn't work?

271
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,000
[DEMON]
Don't you know demons love heat?

272
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,750
Better try another spell!

273
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,541
[SATOU] Guess he's using
some kind of protection magic.

274
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,083
All right, Satou!

275
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,791
Time to get in the fight!

276
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,666
[SATOU]
Damn it.

277
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,833
Oh, yeah.

278
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,291
Satou!

279
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,250
[SATOU]
Come on, beast.

280
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,250
Satou, no!

281
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,208
That's it!

282
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,958
Wow. This holy sword
is crazy sharp.

283
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,791
I took damage
when I pulled it out.

284
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,875
I guess I should
leave it unequipped.

285
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,708
Meantime...

286
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:48,833
[DEMON]
Fight back if you like!

287
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,125
But you'll never prevail!

288
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,375
[DEMON]
Ow!

289
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,458
[SATOU]
Stand down, knights.

290
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,416
I'll take care of
this demon freak.

291
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,208
Flame Spear Attack!

292
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,000
Sacred Javelin!

293
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,291
[DEMON]
Who the hell are you?

294
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,083
You're freakishly strong!

295
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,458
Where did Master go?

296
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,833
Is he gone?

297
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,250
No, I can still smell him.

298
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,166
[SATOU] I need to make
sure they don't notice.

299
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:20,916
[DEMON]
Human!

300
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Who are you?

301
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,125
No one damages a
demon by throwing rocks!

302
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,291
I am confused and enraged!

303
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,625
I'm going to be bested
by a human being!

304
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:39,875
How can this be happening?

305
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,583
It's not possible!

306
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,708
[SATOU]
I'll finish him off.

307
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,875
[SATOU]
Damn it!

308
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,625
[DEMON]
My master!

309
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:57,625
How I've longed
to see thee once again?

310
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,125
Kneel before my master,
the godlike Demon Lord!

311
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,000
He is part of the
Demon King's innermost circle!

312
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:06,750
[JIN]
This is bad news.

313
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,416
A high-level demon lord!

314
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,875
[DEMON LORD]
In setting up this labyrinth

315
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,125
and summoning me hither,
you have done well.

316
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,500
Here is your reward.

317
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,625
[DEMON] I get to become one
with my master once again!

318
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,375
I am beyond overjoyed!

319
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,083
[DEMON LORD]
Run away, my little ants!

320
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:33,166
Those who are strong,
stand firm and prepare to fight!

321
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,416
I will test your mettle!

322
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,791
[SATOU]
That should take care of them.

323
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,750
[DEMON LORD] I did not realize
a hero would be present.

324
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,875
Did you have a
divine revelation?

325
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,375
No matter, you will fall.

326
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,916
Try as you might,

327
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,375
you will never defeat me!

328
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,416
[SATOU] Just how much are you
going to strengthen yourself?

329
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,083
[ZENA] But they say if the sword
accepts the person holding it,

330
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,166
the blade will still glow.

331
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,833
[DEMON LORD]
What's ails you, Hero?

332
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,291
Do you not know how
to use your holy sword?

333
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,250
Such a pity.

334
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,500
[DEMON LORD]
You're quite durable.

335
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,750
Consider me mildly impressed.

336
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,875
[SATOU]
That was close.

337
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,333
If the holy sword won't work,
then I'll have to use magic.

338
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,541
But low-end magic like
Fire Shot isn't going to work.

339
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,750
What about meteor shower?

340
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,583
No, I can't use that.

341
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,833
Air Hammer!

342
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:50,875
Flame Spear attack!

343
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,166
Sacred Javelin Attack!

344
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,333
[DEMON LORD]
You're interrupting my fun

345
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,291
with your infantile spells!

346
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,375
Now you've angered me,
you human scum!

347
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,000
[SATOU]
Take this!

348
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,333
[DEMON LORD]
It seems I was over-confident!

349
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,875
[ZENA] It is quite
difficult to fight demons

350
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:08,916
because only magic

351
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,625
and magical weaponry
can defeat them.

352
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,375
[SATOU]
All right.

353
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,750
[DEMON LORD] Did you truly
think I wouldn't notice

354
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,125
you abandoned your holy sword?

355
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,541
You cannot fool me.

356
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,833
[SATOU]
Fire Shot!

357
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,250
Did it work?

358
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,166
[DEMON LORD] I didn't
think someone so skilled

359
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,000
at martial arts could
utilize magic, too.

360
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,291
I don't understand!

361
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,000
How is this happening?

362
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,416
My word.

363
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,541
That has to be the high-level
magic, Crimson Javelin!

364
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:51,000
[SATOU] Well, actually, no, it's
the starting magic: Fire Shot.

365
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,458
That's right.

366
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,208
The magic gauge on Meteor
Shower said it had ten times

367
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,958
the original power.

368
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,250
Speaking of which,
that reminds me.

369
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:03,500
In order to defeat a Demon Lord,
a hero must wield a holy sword.

370
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,541
[SATOU]
Demon Lords aren't anything like

371
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,833
that eyeball weirdo.

372
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,500
They're godlike entities!

373
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,541
Even though I have a holy sword,

374
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,458
I don't have the
title of "hero" yet.

375
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,958
That's why I can't
get a good hit in.

376
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,583
[SATOU]
But is that right?

377
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,458
Hold on.

378
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,291
What titles do I already have?

379
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,833
[SATOU] If wielding a holy sword
as a "Hero" makes it possible

380
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,416
to smite a godlike entity!

381
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,083
[SATOU] Then it stands to
reason: wielding a Divine Sword

382
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:47,166
as a "God-killer" should
achieve the exact same result!

383
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,750
[DEMON LORD]
What is that blade in your hand?

384
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,458
Damn you, human.

385
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,416
I am vanquished.

386
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:18,833
[TAMA]
Master!

387
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:19,791
You did it!

388
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,375
You beat the Demon Lord!

389
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,833
Pardon me, friend,
are you, Satou?

390
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,333
[SATOU]
Yes, I am.

391
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,166
[SOLDIER F]
Are these your slaves?

392
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:30,958
[SATOU]
Yes.

393
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,125
Well, no, not officially.

394
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,833
Fine.

395
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,583
Well, there's someone
looking for you.

396
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,333
Come on.

397
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,333
[SATOU]
Uh, all right.

398
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,000
[SATOU]
Ladies.

399
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,500
Are you coming?

400
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,833
Okay!

401
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,333
[VILLAGER B]
Hey.

402
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,375
I was wrong
to mistreat you, girls.

403
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,708
I hope you'll forgive me.

404
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,291
[ZENA]
Satou!

405
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,458
You have no idea
how worried I was!

406
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,750
[SATOU]
Well, the important thing is:

407
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,833
We're both safe and sound now!

408
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,333
[SATOU]
I'm wracking up new titles.

409
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,625
But to be honest,

410
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:35,916
out of all of them, this is
the one I care about the most.

411
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,000
Mr. Satou,

412
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,333
I hereby proclaim these
slaves are officially yours!

413
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,041
--[TAMA] Victory!
--[POCHI] Now we're master's!

414
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,291
I thought you
might like to know,

415
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,541
there are several slaves
who didn't sell today.

416
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,625
I'd be happy if you took a look.

417
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:52,791
[SATOU]
No, thanks.

418
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,583
I think I'm all
stocked up on that front.

419
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,458
[LULU]
Uh.

420
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,416
My name is Lulu, sir.

421
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,208
[SATOU]
Lulu.

422
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,375
She seems nice.

423
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,833
[ARISA]
Hello. My name is Arisa.

424
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,125
Satou-sama.

425
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,875
I'm yours.

426
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:10,458
[SATOU gasps]

427
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:11,666
What?
