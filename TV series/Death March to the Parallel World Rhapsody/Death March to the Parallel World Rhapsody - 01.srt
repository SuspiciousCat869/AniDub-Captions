1
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,375
[SATOU]
Perfect.

2
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,833
I should make the 8:33 train
without any problems.

3
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:21,833
[SATOU]
Oh, crap!

4
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,666
It's running early!

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:34,166
[pants]

6
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,666
Adulting is hard.

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,708
Life was a whole lot easier
back when I was school.

8
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,125
Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,166
Forgot it was Sunday.

10
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,916
That's why the train schedule
is running differently.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,833
I can't believe I forgot
what day it was.

12
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:01,458
[SATOU]
Good morning.

13
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:02,833
Hey.

14
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,500
Are you seriously working
over the weekend again?

15
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:06,666
[SATOU]
Always.

16
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,000
We're slammed right now.

17
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,666
You know, cause of the new guy.

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,416
Uh, yeah. That's right.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,041
I can't believe he
just up and quit,

20
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,625
especially right before
the delivery date?

21
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,625
So you're picking up the slack?

22
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,166
[SATOU]
Who else?

23
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,166
But with all the bugs and
changes in the core design,

24
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,000
we might not make deadline.

25
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,916
[COWORKER A] You're a
good guy, you know that?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,958
I hope the brass brings
in some new people, ASAP.

27
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,458
[SATOU] Turnover didn't
used to be this brutal.

28
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:32,583
But now?

29
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,875
Seems like someone
quits everyday.

30
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:37,416
[COWORKER A]
You're a real grown up, man.

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,041
I'm staring down 30.

32
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,250
Better late than never.

33
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,250
Welp.

34
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,958
It's time to start
another death march.

35
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:23,500
[SATOU]
Okay.

36
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,041
Finish line approaching.

37
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,375
I'm done writing all the classes
and commenting everything.

38
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,750
Now I just gotta generate the
documentation and UML

39
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,958
from the source code, and start
drilling down on the bugs.

40
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,416
The end is so close
I can taste it.

41
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,000
Not again, man.

42
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,083
You can't keep changing stuff

43
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,708
I've already
gone over like this.

44
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,041
[SATOU]
Hmph.

45
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,250
[TUBBY]
Sato-- I mean, Suzuki.

46
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:54,000
You and I need to
talk <i>War World</i> , bro.

47
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:57,041
[SATOU] He just tried
to call me Satou again.

48
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,291
We've been working
together for six months.

49
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,083
He should know my name by now.

50
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,916
[TUBBY] We gotta
major problem on our hands:

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,583
the client is saying the game's
too difficult for beginners.

52
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,041
If we don't fix it
before the delivery date,

53
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,333
we are totally screwed.

54
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,666
Huh? I know the
client is always right,

55
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,833
but they told us our target
audience won't play the game

56
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,791
if we make it any easier.

57
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,666
Uh, I guess you're right.

58
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,416
There's another way.

59
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
We should use my idea,
the one that got axed early on.

60
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,166
When you create your avatar, you
get an item that reveals a map

61
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,083
and three heavy-duty bombs.

62
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,000
Cool.

63
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,250
[SATOU] If you clear the area
without using the short cut,

64
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,500
you get a rare achievement.

65
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,958
Two birds, one stone.

66
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,208
Beginners are taken care of,

67
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,125
and skilled gamers have
something to play for.

68
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,041
[TUBBY]
Since we're under the gun,

69
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,750
how about we just go with that?

70
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,958
Good thinking, Suzuki,
I'll leave the rest to you!

71
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:45,958
Hold on a sec!

72
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,416
Yes?

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,500
I still have to fix all the bugs
in that mobile MMORPG,

74
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,375
so I'm running
kinda short on time.

75
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,583
While I'm busy with that,

76
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,458
call the client and
get them to sign off.

77
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,708
If I put in that feature
and the client says "no,"

78
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,291
we won't make deadline.

79
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,291
Yeah. Right.

80
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,666
I'm calling
to confirm right now.

81
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,708
[SATOU]
I guess I'll go get some lunch.

82
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,750
[SATOU] There's always an
event out here, even on Sunday.

83
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:26,583
[GIRL cries]

84
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,083
[SATOU]
Is she lost?

85
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,125
[sighs]

86
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,833
[SATOU]
Hey. You're all right.

87
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,833
What's wrong? Are you lost?

88
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:44,125
[GIRL cries]
My mama.

89
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,000
[SATOU] I have no
idea what's she's saying.

90
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,166
I guess I should probably
take her to a police station.

91
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,333
Right.

92
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,416
Come on, let's go get help.

93
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,541
[MOTHER]
Mana!

94
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,833
[GIRL]
Mommy!

95
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,791
Oh. There you are, my love!

96
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,791
[SATOU]
Oh. Is she your daughter?

97
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,000
She is.

98
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm very sorry if
she bothered you, sir.

99
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,000
[SATOU] Please.
She was no trouble at all.

100
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,041
I'm just glad you found her.

101
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,666
That's a load off.

102
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,291
For a second I was
worried she might think

103
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,208
I was some kind of creep.

104
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,666
Thank you for taking
care of my sweet girl.

105
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,875
[SATOU]
Sure!

106
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,500
[GIRL] I want chocolate
ice cream in a cone

107
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,333
with sprinkles on top!

108
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,833
[SATOU]
Her mom is pretty hot, though.

109
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,333
[SATOU]
All right.

110
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,625
That should do it.

111
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,458
I guess I should test it out.

112
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,416
[SATOU]
Wait.

113
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,583
What was the name
of the game again?

114
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:38,916
Oh, yeah!

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,541
<i>FFL</i> .

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,791
[COWORKER B]
Good work.

117
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,041
[SATOU]
Huh?

118
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,041
Headed out?

119
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,125
Haven't been home in three days.

120
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,958
Gotta get back there fast
before the wife kicks me out.

121
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:54,416
Hey, at least you have someone
at home who actually cares.

122
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,958
[COWORKER B]
That's true.

123
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,958
Playing the field's fun, but you
don't want to do it forever.

124
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,375
Am I right?

125
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,916
You're 29 years old, dude.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,416
You need to find
yourself a lady, my friend.

127
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,250
See ya.

128
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:09,541
[SATOU]
Huh... A lady.

129
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,125
Would be nice.

130
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,000
But when every day
is a death march?

131
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,500
That's a pretty
unrealistic proposition.

132
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,291
Man, I sure could use a bath.

133
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,250
[SATOU]
I'm almost finished.

134
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,916
One last email
and then I'm home free.

135

Suzuki!

136
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,833
We just got a bug report
from the storage testing team.

137
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,083
What?

138
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,833
No, that can't be right,
I literally just spent

139
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,500
the last couple of hours
fixing the storage space bug.

140
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,083
[COWORKER C] I'm not
talking about the inventory

141
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,000
in <i>FFL</i> , dude.

142
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,541
I'm talking about a new one:

143
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,083
There's an item duplication
bug in <i>World War</i> .

144
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,375
Check your messenger.

145
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,458
I just sent you an
attachment with the details.

146
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,125
[SATOU]
All right.

147
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,000
Duplication bugs
are hard to fix.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I see.

149
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,000
The jerk didn't
want to get yelled at,

150
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,416
so he sent me an email.

151
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,041
He better take me out
to lunch somewhere nice

152
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,250
with tons of cute girls!

153
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:25,625
[SATOU sighs]

154
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,291
Done at last!

155
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,333
Huh?

156
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,583
[SATOU] I'm sure there are some
bugs left, but it'll be fine.

157
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:40,333
Digital distribution lets us
patch it later down the line.

158
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,875
I can hear the
users complaining now.

159
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,708
But I don't care.

160
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,916
If I can just
fire off this email,

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,375
I can finally get some sleep.

162
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,083
[SATOU]
I really needed this.

163
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,083
I haven't shut my eyes
in over 30 hours.

164
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,291
Right now.

165
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,708
Sleep is my justice.

166
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,458
What the heck is this?

167
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,916
Am I dreaming?

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,375
Huh?

169
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,833
[SATOU] Of course
the phone doesn't work.

170
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,916
Whoa! I'm young!

171
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,208
Whoa! I look like
I did back in high school.

172
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,291
[sighs]

173
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,541
Well, having a dream

174
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,875
about your younger self
isn't that abnormal.

175
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,666
[SATOU]
But then again.

176
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,916
This is a little freaky.

177
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,708
Don't get me wrong.

178
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,000
When I'm on a death march,

179
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,708
I have dreams about
fixing bugs all the time.

180
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,958
But I don't think I've ever had
a dream where my younger self

181
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:16,166
is actually inside the freakin'
game I'm working on.

182
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,000
It's crazy.

183
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,416
It's kind of like <i>War World</i>
and <i>FFL</i> got slammed together.

184
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,958
And of course it has bugs.

185
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:25,708
[SATOU]
Whoa.

186
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,541
I just did that with my mind.

187
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,916
Satou.

188
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's the name I always
use for my test characters

189
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,958
when I'm working out bugs.

190
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:38,041
[SATOU]
The Valley of Dragons?

191
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,291
Well, I guess that's what
this massive crevice is.

192
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,333
[SATOU]
Uh! What's that?

193
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,083
Uh-oh.

194
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,708
Crap.

195
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:48,958
Weapons?

196
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,208
Looks like all I've got
are three Meteor Rains

197
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,375
and a Map Reveal.

198
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,958
Wait.

199
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,625
This is the idea I came up with
to help out beginning players.

200
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:58,958
The map!

201
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,291
[SATOU] Red dots only
mean one thing: bad guys!

202
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:11,666
[SATOU]
Elite lizardmen?

203
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,166
That doesn't sound fun!

204
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,291
There are hundreds of them
and they're all level 50!

205
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,500
I'm only level one!

206
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,291
I can't beat them in
a hand-to-hand fight!

207
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,958
[SATOU]
I really hate lizardmen.

208
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,791
Oh crap! Please tell me
they don't know I'm here!

209
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,958
[SATOU] I felt that.
I for real just felt that!

210
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,708
[SATOU]
This sucks.

211
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,666
I'm gonna have to fight back!

212
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,416
No way!

213
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,791
My weaponry hasn't
implemented yet!

214
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,583
Aww man!

215
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm about to die here.

216
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,250
And all because of a damn bug!

217
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,333
[SATOU]
Satou here.

218
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,916
I've been a busy
little worker bee,

219
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,333
like any good citizen of a
thriving democracy should be.

220
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,416
Work's been tough lately,
I won't lie, but not so tough

221
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,583
I want to disappear
to another dimension.

222
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,291
I was busy.

223
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:47,083
But it made me feel important.

224
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,041
That's the truth.

225
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:59,000
[SATOU coughs]

226
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,291
Oh no. Crap.

227
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,208
[SATOU] That lizard was too
close to be in the target range

228
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,791
of the meteor strike.

229
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,666
Stick a fork in me.

230
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,750
Rahr-reh-kuhn.

231
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,166
Freh-streen.
Condeen-stuhn gah-dreen.

232
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,666
[SATOU]
This is exactly like a game.

233
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,666
He wants me to fight him.

234
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,750
With this sword.

235
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,250
[screams]

236
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,625
Ow! That hurt! Like, a lot!

237
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,625
[SATOU] Looks like his
life bar is almost gone.

238
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,458
Gotta keep fighting!

239
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,041
[SATOU] I've heard of
people having vivid dreams,

240
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,125
but this is too much!

241
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,500
There has to be a way to get
out of this freakin' nightmare!

242
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,250
Like an off button.

243
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,250
[SATOU]
What?

244
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,875
I can't save
my progress or log out?

245
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,375
You're not very nice
to your players, dream!

246
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,458
[sighs]

247
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,041
This sucks.

248
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:29,833
I need to figure out a way to
heal, at least until I wake up.

249
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,333
Am I already healed?

250
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,583
Oh, wow.

251
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,500
And it feels like the
pain's all gone, too.

252
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,375
Wait a sec.

253
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,500
My max vitality has increased!

254
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,250
And that's not all.

255
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm level 310?

256
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,625
This rules.

257
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:49,208
I must've leveled up
due to the Meteor Rain.

258
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,666
I guess that explains
why I was able

259
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,500
to take out that lizard
freak one-on-one.

260
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,541
[SATOU] Whoa, my ability
points are maxed out, too.

261
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,916
Wait a second, where's the log?

262
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,458
Keep scrolling, keep scrolling.

263
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,083
I'll skip anything that
doesn't make sense.

264
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,416
If this is a log of everything.

265
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,791
What about skills?

266
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,291
I've gotten more magic skill.

267
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,125
I have that
Meteor Rain I just used.

268
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,375
But I wonder if that
means it's disabled?

269
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,458
I guess I just have
to turn it back on.

270
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,958
Typical gaming platform.

271
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,750
Even in a dream,
these things are complicated.

272
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,083
Whatever.

273
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,666
I better test it out while
I still have the chance.

274
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,291
If I get into another sticky
situation with those lizardmen

275
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,333
and it tells me I don't have
enough MP, I'm gonna be pissed!

276
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,916
Not to mention dead.

277
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,291
This should be a
safe enough distance.

278
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,125
Huh?

279
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,125
[SATOU]
Uh-oh. Not good.

280
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,166
[screams]

281
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,750
[SATOU]
That magic is way too powerful.

282
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,000
If I use it all the time,

283
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,791
I might as well declare
myself a super villain.

284
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,375
I think I'd better play it safe.

285
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,833
Bye, bye.

286
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,958
[sighs]

287
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,166
I'm really thirsty.

288
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,583
[SATOU]
There's loot, too.

289
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:57,333
[SATOU] Huh? Lizardman
corpses count as loot?

290
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,500
[SATOU]
Cool. I have a water pouch.

291
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,625
Let's see
if I can use it though.

292
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:04,375
Nice!

293
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,708
It appeared!

294
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,791
[SATOU]
Oh, wow!

295
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:18,833
This is the best water
I've tasted in my entire life!

296
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,000
Unlimited fresh water.

297
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,916
No idea how that's possible,
but it's pretty sweet.

298
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,250
I wonder what else I have.

299
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,875
[SATOU]
I'm loaded up with cash!

300
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,750
I don't feel like organizing
this right now.

301
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,166
But the next time
I come across a town,

302
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,250
I'm gonna have a field day!

303
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,416
[SATOU] A holy sword,
a divine sword, and a magic gun?

304
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,958
Man, I feel like I died and went
to middle school geek heaven!

305
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,458
Ohh!

306
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,708
Wow.

307
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,083
Nice.

308
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,541
[SATOU]
It's weird.

309
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,291
I don't have many skills.

310
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,375
I wonder if you get more
via some sort of action

311
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,375
instead of by leveling up.

312
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,750
I guess I'll add points
to things I'll need in battle.

313
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:15,041
If I come across an army of
lizardmen, I wanna be prepared.

314
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,708
[SATOU] Well, I should
probably get some sleep

315
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,625
before I head out.

316
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:23,541
Besides, exploring
is my favorite part.

317
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,500
[SATOU]
All right.

318
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:38,875
I guess I'll head to this
"Warrior's Fort" place first.

319
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,458
This place rocks.

320
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,083
I've been slaving away in front
of a computer for so long.

321
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,541
I forgot what beauty looks like.

322
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,875
I know this dream
isn't gonna last forever.

323
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,000
But it's a nice escape
while it does.

324
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:51,625
All right.

325
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,208
Here goes!

326
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,500
[SATOU]
So this is Warrior's Fort?

327
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:25,125
[SATOU]
Oh. A monarchy. "Seiryuu City."

328
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,125
That's the closest
place to the fort.

329
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,666
There are about 100 soldiers.

330
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,291
Highest-level soldier
here is only 31.

331
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,083
Average level is 7.

332
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,541
That's pretty low.

333
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:40,833
What's that?

334
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,375
A wyvern, eh?

335
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,291
Let's check it out!

336
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,291
[shrieks]

337
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,000
That hurt.

338
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,666
No, it didn't.

339
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,708
Do I have a pain
reduction skill?

340
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,458
Or maybe it's 'cause my
endurance is really high?

341
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,208
Suck on this, wyvern!

342
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,041
I'm super strong.

343
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,833
Level 310 is no joke.

344
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,083
Huh?

345
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,750
[SATOU]
Wait a sec.

346
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,416
That wyvern's heading
towards the soldiers!

347
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,333
This is my fault.

348
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,166
I have to help them.

349
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:37,416
[incomprehensible yelling]

350
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,875
[gasps]

351
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,541
[SATOU] Huh? I need to
change the language settings.

352
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,583
[MALE SOLDIER A]
Soldiers! Hold your ground!

353
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,791
[MALE SOLDIER B]
Show them our Seiryuu courage!

354
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,125
Here it comes!

355
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,791
Hold strong to your
positions and don't relent!

356
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,541
Dig in your heels, lancemen!

357
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,958
Let your feet in the air, and
the wyvern will blow you away!

358
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,708
[FEMALE SOLDIER A]
Bowmen! Draw it in!

359
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:09,166
Wait for the lances to slow
its speed, and then we strike!

360
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,541
[SATOU]
Those arrows aren't sharp enough

361
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,916
to penetrate the wyvern's hide.

362
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,750
Then again it might
not be the arrows,

363
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,375
it could be the
soldiers' levels are too low.

364
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,541
Tumultuosum!

365
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,708
[MAGE A]
Four winds, Aero hammer!

366
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,041
Lightning Bolt Shock Attack!

367
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:40,791
[SATOU]
It's coming!

368
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:41,958
Zena, stop him!

369
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,166
Right!

370
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,458
Four winds I summon thy power!

371
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,625
Aero Forcefield!

372
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,333
[MAGE B]
Resist Fall Gravity Barrier!
