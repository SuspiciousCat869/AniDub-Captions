1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:09,333
[WAITRESS A]
Here you are.

2
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:11,458
I'm sorry about the wait.

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,750
I hope you enjoy
your dinner, sir.

4
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,166
Thank you.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,625
Here, you can keep
the change, miss.

6
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,166
Thanks.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,250
[PATRON]
Hey! This isn't salty enough!

8
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,833
Oh, shut up!

9
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,041
For what you're paying,
you're lucky it has salt at all!

10
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,416
[PATRON]
You cheap old miser!

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,708
I hope you get stewed alive
in a witch's cauldron

12
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,125
and eaten for breakfast!

13
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:32,333
[BARKEEP]
How about I eat you, jerk?

14
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,875
[SATOU]
Everybody take a deep breath!

15
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:34,583
Relax!

16
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:35,833
The next round is on me!

17
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,541
[cheers]

18
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,625
[SATOU]
Phew. All done.

19
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,333
Time to hit the road.

20
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,125
[SATOU]
Wait a second.

21
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,166
Is this tavern a brothel, too?

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,666
Wee!

23
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,666
[MIA]
Hmm... Impure.

24
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,000
Awww!

25
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,291
You have more girls than
you know what to do with!

26
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,708
Yet you still go to a brothel?

27
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,500
[SATOU] There are so many
painfully obvious reasons

28
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:45,125
why I'm choosing not to
dignify that with a comment.

29
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,666
[DOSAN]
Move it!

30
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,333
Watch where you're
walking, peasant.

31
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,250
You're in my way!

32
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,166
[SHIMUSA]
Forgive me, sir!

33
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:04,541
[SATOU] Huh? Why is moustache
givin' me the evil eye?

34
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:09,833
Be careful.

35
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,125
That man.

36
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,083
He's mean.

37
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,500
Oh yeah?

38
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,083
[LIZA]
You know him.

39
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,833
He tried to take our flying ant
cores back in Seiryuu City.

40
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,583
[SATOU]
Right. That small time crook.

41
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,833
Here. Take this;
you'll feel much better.

42
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:30,791
Please.

43
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,125
[SHIMUSA]
Huh? A magic potion?

44
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,625
[FEMALE VILLAGER]
We've nothing to pay you with.

45
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:34,458
No need.

46
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,041
[SHIMUSA]
Oh! Thank you!

47
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,916
[FEMALE VILLAGER]
You're very kind!

48
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,666
[SATOU] Awesome.
It works on fractures, too.

49
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,291
Wow. Bless you!

50
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,000
I am in your debt, sir!

51
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,583
Aren't you the big hero?

52
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,541
I couldn't just
leave him like that.

53
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,333
Right. That's really
sweet and all.

54
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,583
Just make sure you save
some for when we need it.

55
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,291
Good point. Yeah.

56
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,125
Hmm...

57
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,916
Well, next up on the agenda:

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,541
Master alchemy
and learn to make potions.

59
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,375
[TAMA]
Is it meat?

60
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,416
[POCHI]
No! It's a rabbit, silly!

61
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,208
[ARISA]
Now you're doing alchemy?

62
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,916
Just how multi-talented are you?

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,166
[SATOU] First,
I'll follow the directions.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,083
The name of the creator pops up.

65
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,083
Good to know.

66
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,333
Next time I make an item,

67
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,666
I'll make sure to leave
the name section blank.

68
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,666
I need to learn transmutation
at some point.

69
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,458
I guess there's no time
like the present, right?

70
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,666
Here goes.

71
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,541
Tablet.

72
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,458
Go!

73
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,583
First, I pour in the
medicine I made earlier.

74
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,916
Then I gradually
add some elixir.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,416
And finally: MP.

76
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,208
[SATOU] Once this light
goes away, it'll be done.

77
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,041
[SATOU]
Now,

78
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,333
if I just raise my skill
to max and transmute it!

79
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,708
[TAMA]
You're super smart, Arisa!

80
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,916
[POCHI]
You're so amazing!

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,125
[SATOU]
And just like that,

82
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,916
I have a high-quality
HP recovery potion.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,375
What's this?

84
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,625
It says here I need to store
it in a specialized vial.

85
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,916
If I don't, the potion
will degrade over time.

86
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,083
[SATOU]
Wow, look.

87
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:18,875
These vials have magic circles
drawn on them with special ink.

88
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,125
Huh?

89
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,625
It's probably past time
for a supply run.

90
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,750
There's a town called
Noukee in Kuhanou County.

91
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,708
I should go there tomorrow.

92
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,583
Huh?

93
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,541
[TAMA]
Oh wow!

94
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,166
[POCHI]
You're so good at that!

95
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,541
I guess that's good for now.

96
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,916
I think I might try making
a Magic Item later tonight.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,083
Look at you making
something cool.

98
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,458
Magic Item, number one.

99
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,375
Here, try it out.

100
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,916
Okay!

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,625
Let me guess: When you use it
you're supposed to get magic

102
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,833
to flow from your right hand
to your left, yeah?

103
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,666
[SATOU]
Thank you for the explanation.

104
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,583
'Kay! Here goes!

105
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,333
Huh?

106
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,416
What's supposed to happen?

107
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,666
Channel your MP.

108
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,375
It'll flow right into
the magic circuit.

109
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,958
Yeah, yeah. And, then?

110
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,041
And nothing.

111
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,458
What?

112
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,166
It just goes around and around
till your MP is drained.

113
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,750
[ARISA sighs]
So anti-climactic.

114
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,541
[SATOU]
Fine. I'll give it a try then.

115
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,541
Here goes nothing.

116
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,041
It's an attack!

117
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,791
Defend the wagon cart, girls!

118
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,625
Uh. Don't worry, it's me!

119
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,125
Sorry to freak you out!

120
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,375
[sighs]

121
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,541
I've never seen this before.

122
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,041
There are big blank spots
all over this map.

123
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,458
I don't want to put
everyone in danger,

124
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,833
so I should probably spend
some time studying it.

125
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,625
Better safe than sorry.

126
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,500
Oh, an alchemy shop?

127
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,041
Yeah.

128
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,041
Just head straight that way till
you get to the edge of town.

129
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,083
[DOSAN]
Uh! Watch it!

130
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,416
Sorry. I didn't see you there!

131
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,708
[DOSAN]
Be more careful next time, kid!

132
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,500
Outta my way.

133
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,083
Time to go to the next shop.

134
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,500
Let's get a move on.

135
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,125
You stupid, worthless slave.

136
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,333
Yes, sir.

137
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,666
[DOSAN]
You're slow as molasses!

138
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,458
[SATOU]
Hmm...

139
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,541
Come on, let's go.

140
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,541
Oh. Right!

141
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,208
Afternoon, sir.

142
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,375
[SATOU]
Hi there.

143
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,166
I'm looking for some
elixir for a potion.

144
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,875
Do you have any?

145
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,041
[LENMARIS]
Hmm.

146
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,291
If they're
for stamina recovery,

147
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,958
I have three I can sell you.

148
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,708
They're one silver coin each.

149
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,833
There's a bit of a
core shortage though.

150
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,125
So I can't give you a discount.

151
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,125
[SATOU]
Core.

152
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,916
So that what it's made from?

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,458
If core's what I need,

154
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,458
I have plenty left over from
the Labyrinth and the Cradle.

155
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,291
Awesome.

156
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,333
Do you happen to
have any stabilizers?

157
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,291
Yeah. As a matter of fact, I do.

158
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,291
[SATOU] Also, if you have
any scrolls, I'll take 'em.

159
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,416
I need cores higher
than grade three.

160
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,791
Trade me and it's a done deal.

161
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,208
[SATOU] Wait. Isn't it
illegal to buy or sell cores?

162
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,125
I'll just take the potion vials.

163
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,708
Sorry.

164
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,875
I would, but someone bought up
my stock before you got here.

165
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,333
I tried to tell them "no," but
they had a requisition warrant

166
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,666
with the seal of the
viceroy of Sedum City,

167
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,666
so I didn't have a choice.

168
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,916
[SATOU]
That guy from before.

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,250
[LENMARIS]
Are you in dire need?

170
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,000
I'd check out the
pottery workshop.

171
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,333
They usually have
a decent variety.

172
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,041
[SATOU]
Liza.

173
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:45,958
Go on back with the others.

174
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,666
I'll be there soon.

175
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,083
[LIZA]
Is something wrong?

176
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,125
I need to make a quick stop.

177
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,458
[LIZA]
I should come with you.

178
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,250
[SATOU]
No, it's cool.

179
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,625
Get dinner ready.
I'll be with you in no time.

180
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,208
As you wish.

181
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,125
[LENMARIS] These are some
nice cores you've got here.

182
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,208
Go on, take any
one you'd like, sir.

183
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,333
[SATOU]
That all you got?

184
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,833
[LENMARIS]
I have more.

185
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,250
But I'm not too keen on selling
potentially lethal scrolls

186
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,625
to virtual strangers,

187
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,083
but how about this?

188
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,458
It's called "Blow."

189
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,625
A Magic Scroll typically
used to help stranded ships

190
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:31,875
get back to shore.

191
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,250
[SATOU] Who knows what's waiting
for us in those blank map areas?

192
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,375
[SATOU]
Shield.

193
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,500
Sonar.

194
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,375
Signal.

195
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,000
Blow.

196
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,875
[SATOU]
Hey, not bad.

197
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,291
[SATOU]
I feel like a total creeper.

198
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,791
[gasps]

199
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:19,625
Uh-oh.

200
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,375
Not good.

201
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,958
Why do I get the feeling

202
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,125
something is telling me
to stay the hell out?

203
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,416
The Forest of Illusions?

204
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,666
It doesn't exactly
live up to its name.

205
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,125
This place is disappointing.

206
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,041
I guess the Forest Witch knows
I penetrated the barrier.

207
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,791
I should make myself scarce.

208
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,375
[INENIMAANA spell chant]
Toss Stone!

Yikes! Yikes!

211
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,208
Pay me no attention,

212
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm just a lowly merchant
passing through!

213
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:05,708
I'll go now!

214
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,708
Sound good?

215
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,416
My magic's not working on him!

216
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,250
Mistress, help me!

217
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,125
[SATOU]
Hey, calm down.

218
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,333
It's okay.

219
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,375
Seriously, I have no
interest in hurting you.

220
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,375
Do you want pay back?

221
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,458
You can totally hit me.

222
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,875
I won't resist.

[SATOU]
Umm...

224
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,083
[WITCH]
Hmm...

225
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:38,875
Huh?

226
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,833
It is a true pleasure
to meet you, sir.

227
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,666
Welcome to the
Forest of Illusions.

228
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,583
I am the witch in charge of
guarding the mana source

229
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,375
in these woods.

230
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,208
[SATOU]
Umm...

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,125
[WITCH]
Forgive my apprentice.

232
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,291
Purity of heart and
naiveté go hand in hand.

233
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,541
It was foolish of Ine to attack
an emissary of Bolenan.

234
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,416
My apologies.

235
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,166
Emissary of Bolenan?

236
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,666
Oh, right.

237
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,041
She must think that because
of the bell I got from Mize.

238
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,750
Actually, ma'am,
I'm just a merchant.

239
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,208
I do have an elf from the
Bolenan Clan under my care,

240
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,208
but believe me: I'm no emissary.

Dear, sir.

00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,041
Forgive me for earlier!

245
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:35,625
Heh. It's my fault for stumbling
into your Forest like a moron.

246
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,083
Please stand up;
there's no need to apologize.

Thank you for your patience
with my young apprentice, sir.

How are the potions
coming along?

251
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,791
Don't worry, Mistress!

252
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,333
All is well!

253
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,083
At this rate, I've no doubt
we'll keep our end of the deal!

254
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,833
Huh? What deal?

255
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:57,250
Ine is referring to a pact
we made with Count Kuhanou.

256
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,875
The arrangement is simple:

257
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,416
In return for keeping outlaws,
hunters, and other vagabonds

258
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,208
out of our sacred forest,
we deliver him 300 vials

259
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,416
of a special potion
twice a year.

260
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,750
Oh, I see.

261
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,333
Tell me, son, do you have
any interest in potions?

262
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,208
Yes.

263
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,916
But I just now started learning.

264
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,333
[WITCH]
In that case,

265
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,166
would you like me to teach
you a very special recipe?

266
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,291
Are you for real?

267
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,041
[WITCH]
Yes.

268
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,083
But may I ask for
one small favor in return?

269
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,458
[SATOU]
Of course. I'm glad to help.

270
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,375
Thank you for everything.

271
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,541
Are you sure
you don't need us

272
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,541
to guide you back
home, young man?

273
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,125
[SATOU]
Yeah, I'm fine.

274
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,583
All the same,
here is a small gift.

[spell chant]

276
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,500
Hoho.

277
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,875
[SATOU]
Thank you so much.

278
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,458
I guess I'll be on my way now.

00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,500
[SATOU] She did one for me,
now I need to do one for her.

280
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,708
Should be fun.

281
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,083
Apparently, the person
I promised the witch

282
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,916
I'd deliver this letter
to is a giant of the forest.

283
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,583
Here goes.

Forest of Illusions.

285
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,500
I thought this place
didn't live up to its name.

286
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,208
I was wrong.

Where you at a brothel again?

[BIRKINZ]
Well. Any word?

00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,625
Nothing yet.

Oh yeah?

Well, they're running out
of time, that's for sure.

Sundown will be here
in the blink of an eye.

Either way, it won't matter.

00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,750
That's one delivery

that's never going to reach
its destination, trust me.

Yes, I am.
Thank you for seeing me, sir.

You own this place, right?

So, do we have a deal?

305
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,291
Can you make me
the vials or not?

306

I'm afraid it's a little more
complicated than that, kid.

307
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,541
There's a ton of regulation
here inside the city.

308
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,000
But there is a way.

309
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,666
For example, you're more than
welcome to learn pottery

310
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,875
at my workshop.

311
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,000

[WAITRESS B]
Yes, sir!

[DOSAN] When you officially
become the new viceroy in town,

315
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,083
the very least you can do is
make my clan your worker bees.

You're right.

317

Loyalty should
always be rewarded.

But I won't be viceroy.

319

named lord of my own territory.

[BIRKINZ] To be sure, building
a new town is no small feat.

00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,125
No.

325
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,166
Look who's here!

326
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,625
[gasps]

327
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,500
We came to take you back home!

328
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,375
Right now.

329
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,541
Pardon the interruption, Master,

330
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,333
but it is well past
your bedtime.

331
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,583
[laughs]

332
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,583
Thank you for looking
after our master, sir!

333
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,750
We hope to see you soon!

334
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,625
Yeah!

335
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,416
How in the heck did you find me?

336
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,958
Secret.

337
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,416
[SATOU groans]

338
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,875
[SATOU]
All right, time to make pottery.

339
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:25,583
[SATOU]
Whoa. It's Ine.

340
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,666
Is there something wrong?

341
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,125
Yeah.

342
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,791
Looks like someone I know is
being chased by bad guys!

343
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,125
Huh? Well,
let's do something, then!

344
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:33,916
Come on!

345
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,750
[LIZA]
Right.

346
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,375
[POCHI]
Up and way we go!

347
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,666
[TAMA]
Hang on, Lulu!

348
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,958
[LULU]
Pochi! Tama! Put me down!

349
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,166
They're gonna catch me!

350
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,750
[SATOU]
Liza! Pochi! Tama!

351
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,583
Don't let the bad guys
near the carriage!

352
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,250
[GIRLS agree]

353
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,208
Are you okay?

354
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,625
[INENIMAANA]
Yes! Satou!

355
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:02,750
We're here to help you.

356
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,541
So that's what
they're after, huh?

357
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,166
Yeah. They want
these for the pact.

358
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,041
Go on.

359
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,875
We can handle things here, Ine!

360
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,125
Right.

361
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,458
[screams]

362
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,125
[crash]

363
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,208
[INENIMAANA gasps]
The potions!

364
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,125
[cries]

365
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,750
Don't let them get away, girls!

366
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:30,833
Go after them!

367
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,583
[LIZA, TAMA, POCHI agree]

368
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,666
[SATOU]
All right.

369
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,541
For now, we need
to take an inventory.

370
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,458
[ARISA] So out of the 300 vials
of potion you started with

371
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,500
only a 120 are left.

372
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:48,166
Jeez, that means a
180 were lost in the crash.

373
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,500
The vial on this one broke, but
there's still some left inside.

374
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,291
If I put these in storage...

375
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,333
Okay, that's enough
for about 40 vials.

376
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,541
Come on, let's go.

377
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,208
We should deliver them
what we have.

378
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,083
I'm sure they'll understand.

379
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,041
[BIRKINZ sighs]

380
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,791
That is too bad.

381
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,208
But a pact is a pact after all.

382
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,625
Deliver all 300 vials
of potion by sundown,

383
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,541
or we no longer have a deal.

384
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,000
[INENIMAANA]
But... But, sir!

385
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:19,958
[SATOU]
Hold on.

386
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,875
I've heard his voice before.

387
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,750
Wait...

388
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,916
It's creepy moustache guy.

389
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,166
[SATOU]
It's useless.

390
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,666
I can't get any info.

391
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,208
For now.

392
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:33,666
[ARISA]
Please, sir.

393
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,750
Let us explain.

394
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,708
[DOSAN]
Shut your mouth, peasant girl!

395
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,875
If we want to hear
you speak, we will say so!

396
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,458
Oh yeah?

397
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,250
[SATOU]
If you stoop to a bully's level

398
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:48,000
or let them get under your skin,
then you've already lost.

399
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,041
Now--

400
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,750
Huh?

401
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,500
Is there something
else you need?

402
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,333
[SATOU] Sadly, we lost
about a 180 vials of potion

403
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,250
due to the incident earlier.

404
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,500
You would like us to somehow
replace the missing vials

405
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,500
and deliver them
to you by today.

406
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,625
Did I get any
part of that wrong?

407
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,458
I just need to convince him
to give us permission

408
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,750
to buy the rest of the
potions from the market.

409
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,000
Yes, in fact you did.

410
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,541
First of all, this pact
is between Count Kuhanou

411
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,291
and the Witch of
the Forest of Illusions.

412
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,500
It is not your concern.

413
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,541
Secondly, the only potions
we will accept

414
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,666
are ones made by the witch.

415
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,041
[SATOU]
Wait just a second.

416
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,208
The witch said the words
"special potion."

417
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,166
She didn't say anything about
her being the one required

418
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,250
by the pact to make it.

419
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,000
Besides, the witch
wasn't doing the work.

420
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,083
Ine was the one making the
potions when I was there.

421
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:40,041
I'm not a hundred percent sure,
but I feel like maybe this guy

422
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:44,458
wants the delivery to fail
so the pact will fall apart.

423
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,083
Not maybe. Definitely.

424
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,375
[gasps]

425
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,916
I remember him now!

426
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,833
These are the two shady guys
I saw chatting at the tavern!

427
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,416
[BIRKINZ]
But I won't be viceroy.

428
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,041
In fact, I'm going to be named
lord of my own territory.

429
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,875
[SATOU]
So what is their plan exactly?

430
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,250
To break the pact and get
rid of the Forest of Illusions

431
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,625
so they can build a new
town right on top of it?

432
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,958
Whoever these guys are,
they're up to no good.

433
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:20,000
I could be wrong, but I don't
think that's part of the pact.

434
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,458
Unless the details
of the arrangement

435
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,125
have totally changed, friend.

436
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,583
Tell me: Why should I discuss
the details of my business

437
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,500
with a mere commoner like you?

438
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,666
Because I was a guest
of the witch recently,

439
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,875
and I know you're
not telling the truth.

440
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,166
Very well then.

441
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,125
I'll keep our deal
and take deliveries

442
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:44,208
provided they're the same
quality as the witch's brew.

443
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,791
One more thing,

444
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,666
what if I bring you potions that
are of a much higher quality?

445
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,750
Will you honor the deal then?

446
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,916
Heh. If you think you
can collect them all,

447
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,166
then be my guest.

448
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,666
[SATOU]
I need your assurances.

449
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,708
In writing, please.

450
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,666
What? How dare you?

451
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,875
Mind your tongue, you rogue!

452
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,583
[SATOU]
You'll have to forgive me, sir.

453
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,625
I'm a merchant,
which means I trust no one.

454
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:05,750
You--!

455
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,583
[ARISA] Who does he think
he is calling me a peasant?

456
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,000
[SATOU laughs]
Time to go.

457
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,208
[INENIMAANA] We only have three
bells left until sundown!

458
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,583
There is no way
this plan will work out!

459
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,458
Don't you worry.

460
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,750
My master is a cheating fraud,

461
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,250
but he always comes
to the rescue in the end!

462
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,291
[MIA]
Satou.

463
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,083
[LIZA]
Master. We've returned.

464
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,916
Right. Thanks.

465
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,416
[POCHI]
We brought you the plants!

466
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,208
[TAMA]
Lots and lots a plants!

467
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,958
[INENIMAANA]
Aw! You don't get it!

468
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,791
Even with all the
ingredients in the world,

469
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,791
it's still impossible!

470
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,125
And why is that?

471
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,333
Even if we do manage
to make the potions,

472
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:50,083
it won't matter if we don't
have the vials to store them in!

473
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:53,416
We'll never make
the delivery in time!

474
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,000
[LENMARIS]
Sorry.

475
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,875
I would but someone bought up
my stock before you got here.

476
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,750
He fell for it!

477
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,458
If the fool really thinks all he
has to do is make more potion,

478
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:06,125
he's in for a rude awakening!

479
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,416
We've been had.

480
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,958
What do you mean?
