This looks so good!

Thank you for this food.

00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,041
Liza, it's great.

00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:35,333
Also, Lulu and Nana,
you worked hard, too.

7
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,708
It's our pleasure.

00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:37,875
[SATOU]
Her tail's wagging.

00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,375
She's really happy.

[chuckles]

11
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:45,458
Mia.

12
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,791
I didn't know you
were a picky eater.

13
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,000
No meat.

14
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,208
It's yuck.

15
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,333
Oh, right.

16
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,583
I almost forgot,
elves don't eat meat!

17
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,000
Don't worry,

18
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,708
I still eat meat and nothing's
gonna change that, ever!

19
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,000
Who doesn't like meat?

20
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,708
[TAMA]
It's the best ever!

21
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,666
It's all right, Mia,
to each her own.

22
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,958
[POCHI sighs]
I think maybe I ate too much!

23
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,375
[TAMA]
Yeah, me too!

24
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,625
Liza, why are you
still cooking food?

25
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,333
I'm pretty sure
everyone is stuffed.

26
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,125
Oh. I thought we might
want some provisions

27
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,875
for the long
journey ahead.

28
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:23,583
Awesome.

29
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,666
That's a smart move.

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,000
Ya know what's even smarter?

31
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,416
Storing it in here!

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,375
[SATOU]
What's that?

33
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,208
[ARISA]
An Item Box.

34
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,416
It's awesome.

35
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,791
It's like what you'd
find in a video game.

36
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,666
You store whatever
you want inside.

37
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,750
And whenever you need it,
you can pull it back out.

38
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,208
Just don't overdo it, though!

39
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,500
It'll use up all your mana!

40
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,541
[SATOU]
It uses MP?

41
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,625
That's totally different
from my storage.

42
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,500
[LIZA]
They're finished.

43
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,541
[ARISA]
Okay. Thank you so much, Liza!

44
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:53,791
[LIZA]
No, thank you.

45
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,625
[ARISA]
I'll take it from here!

46
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,250
[SATOU] Actually,
now that I think about it,

47
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,583
I don't really know what
my storage can do.

48
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,416
I should figure
that out at some point.

49
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,416
[SATOU]
You know.

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,625
This place isn't so bad.

51
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,791
Well.

52
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,541
When I find the time, I should
figure out my storage device.

53
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,333
Ladies!

54
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,875
Before we take off,

55
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,666
make sure you've taken care of
your assignments, all right?

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,833
[GIRLS agree]

This'll be fun!

[SATOU]
She's looking better.

60
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,208
After what she's been through,
that's really saying something.

61
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,625
It's a long journey home,

62
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,916
but I have a feeling
she's gonna do just fine.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,041
And yet...

64
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,750
Uh...

65
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,083
Hey! I have an idea!

66
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,458
What do you think
about me touching up

67
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,958
the straw seat cushions
before we hit the road?

68
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,375
The cushions?

69
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,708
What's wrong, are they defective
or something like that?

70
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,500
Uh... Kind of.

71
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,333
Basically, the stupid
straws keep poking me

72
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,625
right in my bottom!

73
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:38,875
Gotcha.

74
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,750
In that case, we should
definitely fix 'em!

75
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,458
All right, ladies,

76
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,708
let's get the cloth off
these straw bundles, ASAP.

77
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,291
Undo this string,
and it'll come right off.

78
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,666
Okie-dokies!

79
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,083
Aye, aye!

80
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,125
Mia, If you see
any straws poking out

81
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,625
from the unwrapped bundles,
your job is to yank them out!

82
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,166
This should fix our problem.

83
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,875
If we put the leather
on the part we sit on,

84
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,500
the straw won't poke through.

85
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,541
 Are you sure about this?

86
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,375
Goat skin is pricey!

87
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,916
I know.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,041
But I don't want everyone's
butts to get all scratched up

89
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,791
'cause I decided
to be a cheap skate.

90
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,166
That's a wise choice!

91
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,416
If our butts get scratched,
they won't be as soft!

How is it possible for a person
to sew with such speed?

You're the fastest
of all time, Master!

What the hell?

"What the hell," my ass!

knot the end of the thread?

of these for everyone,

166
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,708
I have officially
confirmed her name change

167
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,833
in my system's database.

168
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,666
[SATOU]
That was easy.

169
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:45,041
[various whistling tunes]

00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,125

171
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,208
Uh?

00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:54,416
[whine]

173
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,000
Satou?

174
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,458
[SATOU]
I feel so judged right now.

175
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:00,958
I know!

176
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,958
Behold the skill of someone
with level 10 musicianship.

[high-pitched squealing tune]

178
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,083
Ugh. That sounds like the
noise a dying mouse makes

179
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:15,541
when it gets its head
snapped in a mousetrap.

180
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,583
[MIA]
No more.

181
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,583
[LULU]
Oh! Don't worry, Master,

182
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,958
if you keep practicing
your instrument,

183
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,666
you'll get better
one of these days!

184
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,666
If you try hard,
you can do anything!

185
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,458
Uh. Thank you.

186
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,500
Stop goofing off and
come with me right now!

187
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,833
Look there.

188
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,250
Oh, what?

189
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:41,458
[SATOU]
Whoa.

190
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,416
Stone torii?

191
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,708
At first glance,
I couldn't make it out.

192
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,000
But from what I can see,

193
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,416
it seems like three
torii in a row fell over.

194
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,416
There must have
been a shrine here.

195
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,250
[SATOU]
It's weird, but...

196
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:59,125
...I feel like I've
seen this place before.

197
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,791
But how?

198
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,541
[GIRL]
Ichiro.

199
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,291
Never forget this.

200
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,208
We will be together
until the end of time.

201
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,666
You will always be Ichiro,

202
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,833
no matter the world or era
in which you find yourself.

203
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,208
So is reincarnation real?

204
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,291
[GIRL]
It is... but...

205
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,875
...reincarnation isn't enough.

206
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,208
[SATOU]
I remember.

207
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,458
That shrine in the background

208
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,750
is the one that was near
my grandpa's place.

209
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,750
But who's the girl
with the weird hair?

210
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,625
Is she my friend from
when I was little?

211
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,583
[GIRL] The lifespan of a human
is different than that of a God.

212
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,000
In order for us
to stay together,

213
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,333
we need divine intervention.

214

00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,583
Uh. What's wrong?

221
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,416
[sighs] A cliff isn't exactly
the perfect location

222

[SATOU]
What just happened?

224
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,291
I wasn't the victim of
a psychological attack.

225
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,500
And the torii at the shrine near
my grandpa's place were red.

226
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,875
Plus, none of my firends
looked anything like that girl.

227
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,250
Wait a sec!

228
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,791
When I was a student,

229
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,750
I made a doujin game with a
shrine almost exactly like that!

230
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,625
I don't remember having that
conversation in real life.

231
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,416
It must be a part
of the game I made.

232
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,208
What's your deal?

233
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,666
You're spacing out again!

234
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,333
[SATOU]
Uh, I'm sorry.

235
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,458
I was just thinking
about the shrine

236
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,833
where I used to
play when I was a kid.

237
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,416
Huh?

238
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,291
[SATOU]
Whoa.

239
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,208
This looks like a
broken Travel Gate.

240
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,833
Wait, a Travel Gate?

241
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,500
You mean like the warp
feature that shows up

242
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,000
in some video games?

243
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,333
Can you fix it?

244
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,708
Probably not.

245
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:45,583
Quick.

246
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,791
Let's go find Pochi and Tama.

247
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,750
It's time to ship out.

248
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,000
Lookie, Master,
I found us some prey!

249
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,708
Master, since we were able
to procure some meat,

250
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,583
I have one small request before
we continue the journey ahead.

251
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,708
May I butcher that?

252
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,083
[SATOU]
Sure. Why not?

253
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,666
[LULU]
Liza.

254
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,666
If you're willing, I'd be very
interested to learn your skill.

255
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,750
[LIZA]
Come.

256
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,250
I will teach you
the art of butchering.

257
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,750
You can take it apart, Lulu.

258
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,000
[LULU]
Fun!

259
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,458
[SATOU] Oh, no, her hair's
filled with sand.

260
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,791
Hey, Mia.

261
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,291
Do you know of
a Water Magic spell

262
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,833
that's kinda like the
Everyday Magic Soft Wash?

263
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,333
No.

264
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,958
I see.

265
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:20,750
[TAMA]
Look here!

266
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,333
I brought us some meat!

267
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,916
Awesome, Tama, great job!

268
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,625
Wow! Now that's adorable!

269
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,458
[SATOU]
A baby monster.

270
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:29,958
[ARISA]
Oh, can I hold it, please?

271
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,750
Yeah, sure!

272
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,583
[SATOU] It may be cute,
but it's a baby monster,

273
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,000
so be careful, all right?

274
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,625
Yeah, yeah.

275
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,625
[ARISA shrieks]

276
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,666
[TAMA]
Come back!

277
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,250
The prey ran away from me.

278
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,750
No, Tama, it's my fault.

279
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,791
I'm sorry.

280
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,375
It squirmed
right out of my arms.

281
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,000
[TAMA]
No.

282
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,250
I'm sorry I messed up, Master.

283
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,916
I tried, but I couldn't
catch the prey.

284
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,125
[SATOU]
It's fine.

285
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,833
You're safe;
that's what matters now.

286
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,791
Besides, there's
always next time.

287
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:05,583
Right?

288
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,000
[TAMA]
Right!

289
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,416
Next time I'm gonna catch
the biggest, baddest beast

290
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,750
in the whole world!

291
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,166
All this excitement has
made me hungry for a snack.

292
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,416
I've got a great idea:

293
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,083
We should eat the
pancakes from before!

294
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,958
This thing's pretty convenient.

295
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,458
But it doesn't exactly
keep your food warm.

296
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,666
Sorry girls, they probably
don't taste very good cold.

297
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,416
Tastes pretty darn good to me!

298
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,958
Yeah, it's yummy!

299
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,333
[SATOU] Now, let's see
what we have here.

300
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,458
A spell book on shadow magic?

301
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,833
What the--?

302
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,916
Oh, right!

303
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,500
Zen's mementos
are now in my inventory.

304
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:58,666
This could be good.

305
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,208
Maybe I can learn
more about magic.

306
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,375
All right.

307
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,666
I've finished my lesson
on Shadow Magic.

308
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,875
Wow.

309
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,875
It's really amazing how
compatible the magic

310
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,458
in this world is to
programming language.

311
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,833
It's almost as if the person

312
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,875
who created the magic in
this place is a programmer.

313
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,875
Now to the task at hand:
I wanna get a handle

314
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,375
on this whole
Water-Magic-Washing-Spell thing

315
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,708
so Pochi can get cleaned up.

316
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,166
I'll look into
Everyday Magic next.

317
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,916
[SATOU groans]

318
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,416
Everyday Magic is
a huge pain in the ass.

319
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,708
I can't seem to wrap
my head around it.

320
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,708
My Water Magic idea is a no go.

321
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,083
But wait,

322
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,583
just like Mia tried to copy
Arisa's humming by ear.

323
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,083
If I consider the techniques
needed for Everyday Magic,

324
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,291
copy and paste the existing
parts of Water Magic

325
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,375
into the formula,

326
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,333
I should be able
to make a new spell.

327
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,833
I love getting my hands
on this kind of research.

328
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,333
I could do it for hours.

329
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,041
Uh... Wait a second.

330
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,375
Huh?

331
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,541
[ARISA]
Master, stop it!

332
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,916
You've had enough for one night!

333
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,458
[MIA]
Bad boy.

334
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,375
[SATOU]
That was totally not my fault.

335
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,208
Satou.

336
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,375
It's uncouth to be a perv.

337
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,375
That was naughty.

338
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,708
Everyone knows
you're not allowed

339
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,208
to squeeze a woman's bits
till after you're wed.

340
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,083
It's true.

341
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,458
To squeeze, get on your knees.

342
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,625
You had me worried for a second

343
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,916
because your eyes
were wide open,

344
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,958
but you weren't
responding at all!

345
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,500
[SATOU]
I don't wanna freak them out.

346
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,958
I need to make sure
my eyes are closed

347
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,708
when I'm looking at the menu.

348
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,083
Relax, I'm fine.

349
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,166
I was just concentrating

350
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,750
on learning a new
spell, that's all.

351
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,375
Learning a new spell?

352
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,291
Since when are you a bona fide
researcher of magic spells?

353
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,708
I'm not.

354
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,458
I just built one and
was tinkering with it is all.

355
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,333
If it's all right, Mia, I'd like
you to help me with it later.

356
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,000
Mm. 'Kay.

357
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,333
[SATOU]
Huh?

358
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,875
[SATOU]
Whoa! These pop-ups.

359
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,916
Ratmen?

360
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,166
Thank you for
all your help, Satou.

361
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,000
So what's up next for you?

362
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,458
A good question.

363
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,750
I must go find my friends.

364
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,708
Sadly, we were all separated

365
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,250
while trying to
save the princess.

366
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:12,916
[SATOU]
Liza!

367
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,416
Stop the carriage!

368
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,333
Zeze. Jene. Mitoro. Hoze. Rada!

369
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,458
[MALE RATMAN A]
Brincess, you're safe!

370
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,625
[FEMALE RATMAN]
Oh, Brincess!

371
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,916
Mia's protectors?

372
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,041
[SATOU]
They acted as decoys,

373
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,333
so she could safely
escape the Cradle.

374
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,500
Girls.

375
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,625
I think we should
make camp here tonight.

376
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,166
[MIA]
Satou.

377
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,250
[SATOU]
What's up?

378
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,458
You all right?

379
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,541
[MIA]
You two. Talk.

380
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,000
Okay.

381
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,166
My brave, sir, thank you
so much for saving us.

382
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,583
That said, we have
something important

383
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,250
which requires our attention.

384
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,958
We must leave at once.

385
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,625
Oh. Of course.

386
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,625
Go on ahead, we'll catch up
with you guys tomorrow.

387
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,333
Ahhh!

388
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,791
[POCHI]
Oh! That was awesome!

389
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,500
Meat's back on the menu!

390
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,458
That was expertly done, Tama!

391
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,958
Thanks!

392
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,208
Well, shall I cook
the meat, then, Master?

393
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,250
That sounds great.

394
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,916
Let me know if
you need help, okay?

395
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,458
I must say, Tama,
I'm quite impressed with you.

396
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,791
You are truly
a genius hunter, Tama.

397
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:30,750
[chuckles]

398
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,250
Not bad, kiddo.

399
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,625
Check me out, Tama, do you like
my crazy awesome meat dance?

400
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,083
You know I do, Pochi!

401
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,333
Huh...

402
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,833
Hey, Mia.

403
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,041
Ya wanna help me with that
spell I told you about before?

404
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:44,791
[MIA]
Mm-hmm.

405
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,000
[spell chant]

407
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:50,458
Look at us!

00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,291
We're so clean!

We sparkle!

410
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,208
Great success.

00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,833
Thanks a lot, Mia.

412
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,750
[SATOU]
This sucks.

413
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,291
I'm bored out of my mind.

414
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,375
I could make another new spell.

415
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,875
No. I'm supposed to
be on the night watch.

416
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,125
Wait!

417
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,291
How about I try my
little storage experiment?

418
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,458
[SATOU] I can store
things from far away.

419
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,833
Cool.

420
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,291
[SATOU]
Not that far.

421
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,166
Oh, well.

422
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,458
At least now I know--

423
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,666
the threshold for this
is about three meters.

424
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,958
[SATOU]
Ohh...

425
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,500
I can separate each
component of blended things.

426
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,041
In that case,

427
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,833
I can make salt water drinkable.

428
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,875
That'll come in handy!

429
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,875
Especially near the ocean!

430
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,916
Aww man, it doesn't
work with salt water.

431
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,333
Too bad.

432
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,750
Wait.

433
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,416
I bet I can dissect those
insect corpses I got back

434
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,208
at the Cradle.

435
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,875
If I can swing that, Liza won't
have to take apart the prey

436
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:07,583
Pochi and Tama bring
back to the camp for us.

437
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,625
[SATOU]
No dice.

438
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,750
Man, this isn't going very well.

439
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,875
[SATOU]
But...

440
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,833
...I didn't lose any MP.

441
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,541
I guess mine is different
from Arisa's Item Box.

442
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,625
I should check out hers, too.

443
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,541
[yawns]

444
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,166
Yeah, it's official.

445
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,666
Her storage is definitely weak
sauce compared to my apparatus.

446
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,333
It's useless.

447
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,625
Wait.

448
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,166
Hold on.

449
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,500
The flame went out.

450
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,750
Apparently, the stuff in the
Item Box changes over time.

451
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,625
On the other hand,
my storage is different.

452
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,875
The status of the items

453
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,708
in my storage apparatus
doesn't change at all.

454
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:13,625
Who knows?

455
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,708
Maybe time stops in there?

456
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,291
Or maybe it's like a game,

457
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,958
and it's just a bunch
of data stored inside.

458
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,083
I think I have a brilliant idea.

459
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,375
It's so warm!

460
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,708
And it's yummy, too!

461
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,333
Yum in my tum!

462
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,666
I didn't know
you were planning

463
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,166
to reheat the stew
from yesterday, Master!

464
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,333
Thank you, that was
incredibly thoughtful!

Ah, It was nothing.

00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:38,958
So what do you think?

467
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,375
How does it taste?

468
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,250
Not bad.

469
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,500
Ah. Sparkly sparks!

470
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,125

We've got company.

I thank you for rescuing
all my friends.

I am in your debt.

00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,208
My pleasure.

My friends.

rest in peace from this day
until the end of time.

[MIZE] I wish to
bestow you with this bell.

485
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,500
It was hand crafted
by the elves.

486

As you have garnered the
trust of Princess Misanaria.

I shall trust you in return.
