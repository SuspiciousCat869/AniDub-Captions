Choose your social
circle wisely, Mob!

162

If anyone is going
to get in the way

get rid of 'em!

164

Those kids don't actually

Understand?

166

They're just having
fun mocking someone

Uh, all right, I might've
said too much there.

171
00:08:41,442 --> 00:08:43,692
My friends aren't mocking me.

Yeah. Sure.

not everything you say is true.

175

ramen on the way back?

Nobody's mocking me.

179

gullible as you think.

180

[REIGEN sighs]
Damn it, Mob...

181
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:13,108
I promised this client
we'd help in advance.

182
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:15,983
And this is when he
finally no-shows on me.

183
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:17,900
I guess I really did
open my big mouth

184
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:20,525
and say too much yesterday.

185
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:21,692
[REIGEN]
Still...

186
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:23,483

he really doesn't have

187

his problems other than me.

188
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,983
If he cuts ties with me,
he'll end up alone again.

189
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:32,317
There's nothing to worry about.

190
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,025
He'll be back soon
enough. I know it.

191
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,900
Whoa, Brother.

You're home earlier than usual.

193

Oh, hey, Ritsu. Yeah, I...

194
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:43,108
I've decided not to go

195
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:45,817
to Master's place
for a little while.

196
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,692
Well, that's fine and all,
but what brought this on?

197
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:49,900
Reigen's mouth.

198
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:52,150
They had a fight and
Mob won't talk to him.

199
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:54,108
That has nothing to do with it.

200
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:56,400
I just thought
about it and decided.

201
00:09:56,483 --> 00:09:59,483
For far too long, I've
been blindly following

202
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,650
what Master Reigen says.

203
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:03,608
I felt like things
went better that way.

204
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:06,900
So it was easier for me
just to go along with it.

205
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:08,067
But...

206
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,108
Would you grow up,
already? Seriously, Mob.

207
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:14,775
I can't just keep
relying on him forever.

208
00:10:14,858 --> 00:10:19,358
So I figured I'd reconsider
what I wanna do a little more.

209
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:23,942
[RITSU]
Wanna play some video games?

210

[DIMPLE]
You messed up, Reigen.

211
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,192
And you got no one
to blame but yourself.

212
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:30,483
Oh, man!

213
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:32,525
I think I sweat off
whatever was haunting me.

214
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:35,650
I guess coral steam yoga
really was the best approach.

Why am I so surprised, though?

I basically built this business

from the ground up
all by myself.

220

if Mob's here or not?

optimistic about this.

Sorry, Mob. This probably wasn't
what you were expecting,

his decision.

He probably feels awkward
about talking to me.

Well, well, Reigen!

Welcome back. It's
been far too long.

It's Reigen!

Nice to see ya
here again, buddy!

321
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:58,692
What a surprise!

322
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:01,400
Come join us!
We need to catch up!

323
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:03,275
A lemon sour...

00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:04,733
Go heavy on the sour.

325
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:07,275
Wait, should you be
drinking right now?

326
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:08,942
[REIGEN]
Yeah.

327

[REIGEN]
The regulars here are nice,

328
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:11,858
but they're also the type
of people who'd fall

329
00:16:11,942 --> 00:16:15,067
for pyramid schemes,
fake cults, stuff like that.

330
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,983
And they all need that
certain someone to vent

331
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:20,067
their troubles to that can
help relieve their stress...

332
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,942
...and make them feel better...

333
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:26,275
[REIGEN] It's basically a gold
mine for someone like me.

334
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:28,900
A place where the
weak-minded gather.

Reigen, get a load of this one!

336
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:31,983
Just the other day,

337
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,733
this really pretty girl
started chattin' me up.

338
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:34,858
So I walked along with her

339
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:36,733
and she led me
to some art exhibit.

340
00:16:36,817 --> 00:16:37,775
An exhibit where a copy

341
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:40,108
of a famous painting
was on display.

342
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:42,400
That's a dating scheme.

343
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:44,942
[REIGEN] I'll give them some
random words of advice.

344

In return, I get their respect.

345
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:48,317
They might be...

346
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,192
...the closest thing
I have to real friends.

This is the perfect time

to bring this up since
it's your birthday!

355

I have this amazing pillow

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,858
I got through a
special connection.

357
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:15,858
It's super soft while
still being supportive!

It's made of this
unique memory foam!

Well, that backfired.

I thought I wanted

To anyone.

[NARRATOR] After ending up
alone and getting over it,

[NARRATOR] He started
using his time to help

00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:06,775
beautify the city, he
live-streamed exorcisms online.

389
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:08,858
He held free seminars
and even offered

390
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:10,608
people life coaching
and counseling,

391
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,650
broadening his field of work.

392
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:17,067
But, he continued his usual
exorcism jobs with vigor.

393
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,733
One involved the
super-popular online game

394
00:19:19,817 --> 00:19:21,942
<i>Fantasy Hell</i> .
There was a rumor that

395
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:24,567
the Player Killer
was actually a ghost.

396
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,358
It was a difficult job
that many other psychics

397
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:29,108
had declined to take.

398
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:33,525
Well, I've heard of it,
but I didn't even bother.

399
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:35,900
It's not something
we specialize in.

400
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:39,358
Our spiritual power can't
do anything inside a game.

401
00:19:39,442 --> 00:19:40,650
Understand?

402
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:42,358
[NARRATOR]
Meaning it was a target even Mob

403
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:45,900
with all of his powers wouldn't
be able to exorcise.

404
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:48,192
However, Reigen used
multiple accounts

405
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:50,275
and stayed up late
night after night,

406
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:53,233
repeatedly leveling up and
strengthening his weapons.

407
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,108
He then baited the
ghost player out,

408
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:58,275
surrounded it, and beat
the living crap out of it.

409
00:19:58,358 --> 00:20:02,067
In doing so, he finally
succeeded in the exorcism.

Y-You're amazing!

continued to grow.
