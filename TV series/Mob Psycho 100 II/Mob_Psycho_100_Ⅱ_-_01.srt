00:00:10,442 --> 00:00:12,108
[NARRATOR]
Whether you believe it or not,

2
00:00:12,192 --> 00:00:14,233
the world around you
is filled with strange

3
00:00:14,317 --> 00:00:18,150
phenomena that science
has yet to explain.

4
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:19,733
And in those
unfortunate moments

5
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:21,775
when people come
face-to-face with them,

6
00:00:21,858 --> 00:00:26,192
they are helplessly thrown
into the dark depths of fear.

7
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:28,150
But there are those who choose

8
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,983
to fight against the
darkness every day,

9
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:33,608
shining a ray of hope
into that chaos.

10
00:00:33,692 --> 00:00:36,067
These warriors
opposing the shadows...

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,150
...are called "Psychics."

12
00:00:40,442 --> 00:00:42,400
[CLIENT 01A]
I know what I saw.

13
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:45,525
And it wasn't of this world.

14
00:00:45,608 --> 00:00:48,775
Weird stories about this place
have been around forever.

15
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:50,650
That's how I bought it so cheap.

16
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:53,483
But I never put much stock
into that sorta thing.

17
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:54,942
The problems with my fields

18
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:57,483
always seem to happen
right before harvest time.

19
00:00:57,567 --> 00:01:00,192
So one night, I got
curious and decided

20
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:02,358
to find out what was going on.

21
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:03,858
That's when I saw it!

22
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:07,650
Some squirmy thing dancing
around the sky above my fields!

23
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:11,317
[CLIENT 01A] The very next
morning, all my crops

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,858
had rotted right
where they stood.

25
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:16,900
Lucky for me, I'm only growing
these crops as a hobby.

26
00:01:16,983 --> 00:01:19,358
But after three years
in a row of this happening,

27
00:01:19,442 --> 00:01:21,608
it's really starting
to scare me.

28
00:01:21,692 --> 00:01:24,108
Harvest time is right
around the corner.

29
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:26,650
And that's why I decided
to give you a call.

30
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:28,942
I figure, if anyone
can help me out of this,

31
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:31,067
it's a psychic, like you.

32
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,983
You made the right call, sir.

33
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:35,692
[CLIENT 01A] But the problem
is, my moron of a son

34
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:37,942
is gonna be starting up
high school next year,

35
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:39,233
and, uh...

36
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:40,650
I can't really...

37
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,692
Kinda short on funds, are you?

38
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:44,817
[CLIENT 01A]
That depends, uh...

39
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,525
[sighs] I'm trying to
make a living, you know.

40
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,192
I need to make sure
I'm getting properly

41
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,775
compensated for my time.

42
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:53,275
[CLIENT 01A]
Of course...

43
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:54,483
[REIGEN]
How 'bout this.

44
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:56,025
If I can get rid of
whatever it is that's

45
00:01:56,108 --> 00:01:58,442
haunting your fields...

46
00:01:58,525 --> 00:01:59,608
[CLIENT 01A]
Uh--

47
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:01,608
...you give me 30%
of your next harvest!

48
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:03,900
Sound like a deal?

49
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:07,358
[CLIENT 01A] He'll take
payment in vegetables?

50
00:02:07,442 --> 00:02:09,275
[REIGEN] I looked into this
a little, and I don't think

51
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:11,733
there's any issues with
the fertilizer or the soil.

52
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:14,942
Which means I've ruled
out any natural causes.

53
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:17,150
What do you think, Mob?

54
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:19,025
I think you should
stop telling me

55
00:02:19,108 --> 00:02:21,483
to drop everything for you.

56
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:24,150
[REIGEN] It might be
a daikon radish spirit.

57
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:26,317
[MOB]
Radishes have spirits?

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
[REIGEN]
Hmm?

59
00:02:27,483 --> 00:02:30,233
Hold on. Did you
see something move?

60
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:34,650
Yeah, I did. It's weak,
but I sense a presence.

61
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:37,358
[SCARECROW] I heard you
talking this afternoon.

62
00:02:37,442 --> 00:02:40,692
You're gonna get rid of me, huh?

63
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:43,900
[SCARECROW laughs]

64
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:46,900
Uh-huh. Hey, Mob.
Take care of this, will ya?

65
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:48,025
Sure.

66
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:50,942
[SCARECROW yelps]

67
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:53,358
We done, then?

68
00:02:53,442 --> 00:02:55,692
Uh-huh. It was only hanging
out in the scarecrow,

69
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,983
so I don't think it was
that big of a threat.

70
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:00,858
[rumbling]

71
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:03,858
[REIGEN]
What the hell?

72
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:05,900
[MOB] Oh. That's the
spirit's actual body.

73
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:08,483
[REIGEN]
So the scarecrow was a decoy?

74
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:09,317
[yelps]

75
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,150
[yells]

76
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:14,942
[KUNEKUNE]
This land belongs to me!

77
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:17,108
No one else can claim it!

78
00:03:17,192 --> 00:03:18,900
Oh, yeah?! Then
show me the deed!

79
00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:20,317
Do you even have
the faintest idea

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,942
how much work it takes
to raise crops, you squatter?!

81
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:25,025
That's a nasty prank
to play on someone!

82
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:26,317
[KUNEKUNE]
Oh, don't worry.

83
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,858
I'm not letting the
ripened crops go to waste.

84
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,233
Or did you think that
spirits can't eat?

85
00:03:31,317 --> 00:03:33,650
[REIGEN] Well, it's not
like ya need the calories!

86
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,775
[KUNEKUNE] No, but I can
absorb the life energy

87
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:37,650
of the crops in the fields!

88
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:40,317
So they are most
definitely feeding me!

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,067
[KUNEKUNE laughs]

90
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,817
You damned vegetable thief...

91
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,025
Now, Mob! Blow him away!

92
00:03:46,108 --> 00:03:47,025
Right.

93
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:49,733
[KUNEKUNE]
Well done, kid.

94
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:52,483
But your loudmouthed buddy
seems pretty powerless to me!

95
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,108
[yelps]

96
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,525
Master!

97
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:58,775
[KUNEKUNE] Both of you will
end up as my fertilizer!

98
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:02,983
[KUNEKUNE]
You're wasting your time.

99
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:05,067
No matter how many vines
and roots you destroy,

100
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,775
they're only a small part
of the plant I control!

101
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:10,192
But seriously, don't
even try to hurt me.

102
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:11,858
If you do, I'll
strangle this man

103
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:13,692
and rip his corpse apart.

104
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:19,317
[KUNEKUNE]
What a child you are.

105
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,858
I mean, you were going to
die either way, you know.

106
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,317
[MOB] If cutting away
the vines and roots

107
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,608
doesn't damage him at all...

108
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:32,067
...then he's not
possessing them--

109
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,608
he's controlling them.

110
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:35,942
Like he's got a remote.

111
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:40,275
I've never even thought
about that, before.

112
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:41,900
I could do it, too.

113
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:44,317
The same way as
this evil spirit.

114
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,108
[KUNEKUNE]
What the hell?!

115
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,108
[REIGEN]
Hm?

116
00:04:59,192 --> 00:05:01,817
The plant's not moving
around anymore.

117
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,733
Well, that's because
I gave it an order.

118
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:06,983
I sent it stronger
telepathic waves than

119
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:10,108
the evil spirit, so I
was able to control it.

120
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:12,025
That was the right answer, Mob.

121
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:13,900
Nice job figuring it out.

122
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:18,233
[KUNEKUNE]
You annoying little brat!

123
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:21,483
You stole control
of the plant from me!

124
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:23,942
You're gonna pay for that!

125
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:28,192
[KUNEKUNE]
Die, bastard!

126
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,775
[KUNEKUNE]
Damn you!

127
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:36,150
[REIGEN]
Huh?

128
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:37,317
[REIGEN yelps]

129
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,650
[KUNEKUNE yells]

130
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:46,567
[MOB]
What's all this about?

131
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,442
I thought I'd try
some home gardening.

132
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:50,192
And if it works,
it'll help save a chunk

133
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:51,942
of change on groceries.

134
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:53,483
The vegetables that
guy was supposed

135
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,608
to give us got torn to shreds.

136
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:57,983
So, instead, he gave
us soil, fertilizer,

137
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,233
and vegetable seeds.

138
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:01,775
Oh, this is for you.

139
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:03,817
It's your payment
for the last job.

140
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,608
Broccoli seeds.

141
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:07,817
[MOB]
Now I'm not even getting money.

142
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,442
Thank you, I appreciate it.

143
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:10,317
[REIGEN]
Oh, right!

144
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,733
[MOB]
Hmm?

145
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:14,108
[REIGEN] I planted a cherry
tomato seed in this pot.

146
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:15,900
So why don't you try
sending some energy

147
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:18,442
into it to see if you
can make it grow faster?

148
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:19,858
Okay.

149
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:24,192
[REIGEN]
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!

150
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:26,817
Holy crap! That's amazing!

151
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,525
I sense a new business venture!

152
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:30,983
And the taste?

153
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:35,358
Uh-huh...

154
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:38,650
[REIGEN] You can take these
tomatoes home with you.

155
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:39,900
[MOB]
Oh.

156
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,358
[MOB]
Huh?

157
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:16,983
[BELIEVER 01A]
Welcome back, everyone.

158
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:19,192
I'd like to call to
order the 12th meeting

159
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:22,025
of the Psycho Helmet
Religion's leadership.

160
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:23,900
Okay, as per our last meeting,

161
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:25,692
today's opening
topic of discussion

162
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:27,525
concerns our headquarters.

163
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:30,067
Uh, sorry to interrupt,
but I've got a question.

164
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,608
I was only hoping
to get an update.

165
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:36,275
Have there been any developments
in the search for our leader?

166
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:38,108
We've yet to locate him.

167
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:39,733
Several men have stepped forward

168
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:41,608
and claimed to be
our missing leader,

169
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:43,900
but all of them
were just fakes.

170
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:46,108
If you remember,
I was the one closest

171
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,067
to him onstage at the
LOL gathering place,

172
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,858
so I'm sure of it.

173
00:08:50,942 --> 00:08:53,192
But I've got a few
leads, so I'm positive

174
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:54,983
I can bring in our
leader before too long.

175
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,983
[BELIEVERS gasp]

176
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:58,900
[MEZATO] And by "leads,"
I mean he's actually

177
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:01,483
been someone I've
known this whole time.

178
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:03,400
I plan on firing
up these people,

179
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:04,983
and making Mob a religious icon

180
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:07,692
before he even knows
what hit him!

181
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:10,400
The only problem
is Mob, himself.

182
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,150
There's no way he's
capable of leading

183
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:14,608
anyone right now.

184
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:17,650
I need him to grow up
and be more confident.

185
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:19,442
If only there was
some kind of activity

186
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:23,817
or responsibility that
would help him mature...

187
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,900
[KAMURO]
Um...

188
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:27,942
I, Shinji Kamuro,
as of this moment,

189
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,025
resign my position as
student council leader.

190
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:31,942
[TOKUGAWA]
What?

191
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:33,108
[RITSU gasps]

192
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:35,025
This is my way of
taking responsibility

193
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,775
for my poor leadership.

194
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:39,233
I spread false rumors
about innocent students,

195
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:41,775
entirely of my own accord.

196
00:09:41,858 --> 00:09:44,400
An election for a new
student council president

197
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:47,108
will be held in the
very near future.

198
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:48,608
[MEZATO]
This is it!

199
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:51,567
This is just the kind of thing
that could help Mob grow!

200
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,900
Who am I kidding?

201
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,608
He has no incentive to
run in the first place.

202
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:57,233
What do I do?

203
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:58,358
[gasps]

204
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,900
[POTATO] Any predictions for
Student Council President?

205
00:10:02,983 --> 00:10:04,358
Well...

206
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:05,858
Not really.

207
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:08,192
To be honest, I just hope
it's someone normal, you know?

208
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,567
[MOB]
Wow... Tsubomi...

209
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,900
She's so cute.

210
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:15,400
Stop staring at her,
it's creepy.

211
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:17,275
--[MOB] Mezato!
--Stop freaking out, too.

212
00:10:17,358 --> 00:10:19,025
So looks like you've really got

213
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:21,025
a thing for her,
don't you, lover-boy?

214
00:10:21,108 --> 00:10:23,192
[gasps] How did you know?

215
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:24,942
[MOB screams]

216
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,233
Jeez, overreact much?

217
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:29,192
I gotta say, I'm
a little surprised

218
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:30,900
that you'd fall for
the exact same girl

219
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:33,983
that everybody else in
the entire school is into.

220
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,692
[MEZATO]
Honestly, I have no idea

221
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:37,733
what you even see in her.

222
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:40,442
She's been my friend
since we were little kids.

223
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:42,858
So, she's really
that popular, huh?

224
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,192
I see...

225
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:45,400
It's weird that you ended up

226
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:47,692
so different since you
were childhood friends.

227
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:49,983
Normally you'd have no
chance with a girl like her

228
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,108
given your current
status as a nobody.

229
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:53,442
Lucky you!

230
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:55,358
Now you've got the perfect
chance to change that!

231
00:10:55,442 --> 00:10:56,942
What're you talking about?

232
00:10:57,025 --> 00:10:59,858
[MEZATO] The position of Student
Council President is open!

233
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:01,442
Right now, you're
not worthy to even

234
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:02,817
stand next to her.

235
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,192
But what if you just so happened

236
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:07,067
to be the new Student
Council President?

237
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,817
Much more impressive, right?

238
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,942
It might be just the
thing to get you closer

239
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:12,983
to the girl that everyone wants!

240
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,275
[gasps]

241
00:11:14,358 --> 00:11:16,358
If you're willing to
run for the position,

242
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,525
I'm willing to help.

243
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:20,150
Of course, you'll
owe me big time.

244
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:23,567
This is your one and only chance
to make a girl like you, Mob!

245
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,275
[NARRATOR] Starting that day,
Mob trained like never before.

246
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:37,483
[NARRATOR]
And one week later...

247
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:39,108
[MC] We will now
begin the speeches

248
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:42,067
for the next Student
Council President election.

249
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,858
These are your four candidates.

250
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:50,067
First up will be Kyohei
Morishige of Year 2, Class 2.

251
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,733
[NARRATOR]
And so each candidate was given

252
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:54,150
an opportunity to speak.

253
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:58,817
[MC] Next, from Year 3,
Class 4, Shinji Kamuro.

254
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
[STUDENTS murmur]

255
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:01,650
For real? What's he doing here?

256
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:04,067
Like, didn't he just quit?

257
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:10,525
[RITSU] Sir, why did you
quit without telling me?

258
00:12:10,608 --> 00:12:12,817
I was responsible for this, too!

259
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,358
[TOKUGAWA]
Well, that doesn't absolve you

260
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,108
from what you did.

261
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:18,358
Why crawl away and hide?

262
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:20,067
Run for President again.

263
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,025
And if you win it,
make things right.

264
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:25,692
[KAMURO] Yeah. I'll do
better this time.

265
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:30,733
[NARRATOR] And then finally,
it was Mob's turn

266
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,567
to give his speech.

267
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,067
[RITSU]
Brother?

268
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,150
What is he doing up there?

269
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:42,067
Huh? Is that Mob?

270
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,900
[MEZATO]
I wrote a hell of a speech,

271
00:12:43,983 --> 00:12:46,233
and we've practiced
it over and over.

272
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:47,983
He can win this.

273
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,567
[ALL]
Kageyama! You can do it!

274
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,317
[ONIGAWARA] White T Poison's
gonna take over

275
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,358
the whole school? What a badass!

276
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,317
[RITSU] I was going to
vote for Kamuro, but...

277
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,733
This definitely changes things.

278
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:06,900
[MC]
Finally, we have Shigeo Kageyama

279
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:09,317
of Year 2, Class 1.

280
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:12,692
[inahles]

281
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:27,442
[MEZATO]
It's over...

282
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:29,067
[NARRATOR] It was the
first time in history

283
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,608
that a candidate spent the
entirety of his allotted

284
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:35,483
five minutes not
uttering a single word.

285
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:39,525
[MEZATO sighs]

286
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:40,858
Well he's not
gonna lead anything

287
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:42,567
with that kind of performance.

288
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,067
He needs to grow up and
have more confidence.

289
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,650
That was stupid. I never
should've done it.

290
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:52,650
Look at him. He's really
takin' it hard this time.

291
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,025
He's not even moving.

00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:56,733
Go home and get some
rest, man. Okay?

00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:59,108
[MOB]
Okay. I'm sorry.

00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:05,442
[MOB]
Huh?

295
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:09,067
Is-- Is this what I think it is?

296
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,317
It took a lot of courage
to stand up there

297
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,233
when you obviously
didn't want to.

298
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:16,275
When I saw you doing that,
I really fell for you.

299
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:18,150
So, um...

300
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,358
Have any interest in dating me?

301
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,900
[MOB]
Huh?

302
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:33,525
[EMI]
Hey, Kageyama!

303
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:35,817
Walk home with me?

304
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,400
Oh. Well, uh... My club is--

305
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:39,983
[GODA]
Go on ahead, Kageyama!

306
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:41,983
We'll train by ourselves, today!

307
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:44,525
Thanks, Musashi.
I appreciate it.

308
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:45,775
[TOME]
Huh?

309
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:48,525
So, when in the hell did
Mob get a girlfriend?

310
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:50,942
[KIJIBAYASHI] No way. Did he
invoke the supernatural?

311
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:53,025
[INUKAWA] Girlfriend?!
What's going on here?

312
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:55,317
[SARUTA]
I am so jealous!

313
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:01,358
[EMI] So what do you do in
your spare time, Kageyama?

314
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,150
[MOB] Well, I train and
run and do other stuff

315
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,900
with the Body Improvement Club.

316
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,483
And I help this guy
I know with his work.

317
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:09,525
What does he do?

318
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,108
Huh? Exorcis-- Uh--

319
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:14,942
I mean, uh... It's kind
of like a book store.

320
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:16,525
Are you saying you
work at some kind of

321
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:18,733
specialty book store? Amazing!

322
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:22,233
No, it's no big deal.
I'm really not that involved.

323
00:15:22,317 --> 00:15:24,983
I just help with basic
things here and there.

324
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:26,233
It's still cool!

325
00:15:26,317 --> 00:15:28,608
I'd love to work at a
place like that someday.

326
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:31,067
[MOB] I can't believe
I just lied to her.

327
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,733
But she'd be creeped
out if I told her

328
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:35,692
I was a part-time exorcist.

329
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:38,233
[EMI]
You look kinda pale. You okay?

330
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:42,358
[MOB] I'm fine. So...
do you like books, Emi?

331
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,608
[EMI]
Uh, yeah, I do... Um...

332
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:47,150
[EMI chuckles nervously]

333
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:49,650
I guess I could
tell you, Kageyama.

334
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:51,108
[MOB]
Hmm?

335
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:53,608
In my spare time,
I write novels and stuff.

336
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:56,067
[MOB gasps]
Wow! That's amazing!

337
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,400
[EMI]
How is that amazing?

338
00:15:57,483 --> 00:15:59,567
Oh, I get it. You think
it's dumb, huh?

339
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,275
N-No! I don't think that at all!

340
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:02,608
It's great! Really!

341
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:05,942
I just couldn't come up
with anything else to say.

342
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:07,692
Maybe I'll let you read one.

343
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:09,733
Never shown them to anybody.

344
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:12,358
And it's kind of
embarrassing, but...

345
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:13,817
if you want to...

346
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,983
[MOB]
I'd love to read them.

347
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,067
[NARRATOR]
After that, Mob walked Emi home

348
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,650
from school every day.

349
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:23,192
How's it goin', Mob?
You're home kinda early.

350
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,650
What, did you quit the
Body Improvement Club?

351
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:26,650
[MOB]
Mm-mm.

352
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:28,442
I'm headed back up
to school now.

353
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:30,525
[DIMPLE]
Huh?!

354
00:16:30,608 --> 00:16:33,483
I wonder why he even
came home, then?

355
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:34,817
What's up, Mob?

356
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,858
You're lookin' pretty
chipper today, aren't ya?

357
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:38,567
You pumped for the exorcism?

358
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,942
Chipper and pumped, huh?

359
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:41,483
Guess I didn't notice.

360
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,567
[REIGEN]
Get a girlfriend or somethin'?

361
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,650
Who am I kidding?

362
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:45,775
[laughs]

363
00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:47,067
[MOB]
Looks like we're finished here,

364
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,483
so I'll be heading home-- Bye!

365
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:52,817
[REIGEN]
Uh... Huh?

366
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,942
One more please.

367
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:55,233
My growing boy!

368
00:16:55,317 --> 00:16:56,942
It's rare for you
to ask for seconds.

369
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:58,692
So what's wrong, Shigeo?

370
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:01,150
Did you use up too much
of your psychic powers?

371
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,942
No, it's nothing like that.

372
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:05,692
[RITSU] I thought for
sure he'd be depressed

373
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,442
after the election.

374
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:09,775
Glad to see he's
doing all right.

375
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:16,692
Looks like you're
just about finished.

376
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:18,650
Is it okay?

377
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:21,650
It's great.
At least, I think so.

378
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,567
You know a lot of
words, don't you?

379
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,817
[gasps]

380
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,525
If you don't understand it,
then just say so.

381
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:31,567
[gasps]

382
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,442
No, wait! It's not that!

383
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:36,400
I really did pay attention
when I read it!

384
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:38,400
So, Kageyama...

385
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:40,983
It's been about a week now
since I asked you out.

386
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:43,025
And that sorta
has me wondering...

387
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:44,608
Why are you still
walking home with me

388
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:46,358
after you turned me down?

389
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:48,900
Is it 'cause you've been
feeling sorry for me?

390
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:52,275
Huh? No, it's nothing
like that. I swear.

391
00:17:52,358 --> 00:17:53,900
I know you're going
back to your club

392
00:17:53,983 --> 00:17:55,692
after you walk me home.

393
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,317
You just keep trying
to make me feel better.

394
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,317
Is it sympathy? It makes
me feel like a loser.

395
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,525
[MOB] I-I'm sorry.
That's not what I meant.

396
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:06,275
Constant apologies.

397
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:07,650
Now that I'm thinking about it,

398
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:09,775
I don't know how you
really feel at all.

399
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:12,192
Or maybe, the truth is...

400
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:14,358
...you don't actually
have any feelings.

401
00:18:14,442 --> 00:18:15,733
[gasps]

402
00:18:15,817 --> 00:18:18,275
[EMI] I mean, like, your
own opinions about stuff.

403
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:20,775
Like that speech where
you just froze up.

404
00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:22,358
You only ran for
president because

405
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:24,817
someone else told you to, right?

406
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:27,525
Listen...

407
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:30,858
You know, I'm actually
kind of the same way.

408
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:32,858
Seriously?

409
00:18:32,942 --> 00:18:34,275
[EMI]
The only reason I asked you out

410
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:36,025
is because I lost a bet.

411
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:37,525
My friends thought
your silent speech

412
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:40,275
was hilarious, so we
played rock-paper-scissors

413
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:41,442
and I lost.

414
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:42,983
At first, I was scared.

415
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:46,233
Because if you turned me down,
everybody would laugh at me.

416
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:47,608
But since you walked
home with me,

417
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:50,108
no one found out that
you actually did.

418
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:51,525
Thanks for that.

419
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:53,358
It's been long enough
by now, though,

420
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:56,025
so I figured I had
to tell you the truth.

421
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,858
[EMI] I'm sorry I lied
to you for a week. See ya.

422
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:39,650
[FRIEND 01A]
Wait a second. You write novels?

423
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:40,858
That's so lame!

424
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:42,108
[FRIENDS laugh]

425
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:44,358
Let me read it!

426
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:46,233
Just look at all
these big words!

427
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:47,233
What is this crap?

428
00:19:47,317 --> 00:19:48,483
Ah, heh...

429
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,942
Hey, cut it out! Stop
looking at that stuff!

430
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:52,775
It's embarrassing, okay?

431
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,983
[FRIEND 01A]
Hmm...

432
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,067
Are you serious about this?

433
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,900
No, it's just something
I do in my spare time.

434
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:00,608
[FRIEND 01A]
Looks like a waste of time!

There!

436
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,608
Can't believe you sit around
writing this junk all day!

437
00:20:04,692 --> 00:20:06,775
[EMI]
I-I don't do it all day.

438
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:08,400
Come on, stop it.

439
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:10,733
Now you're getting
litter everywhere.

440
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:12,817
No, it's all right. Rip it.

441
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,817
Shred it up into tiny pieces.

Don't.

444
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,442
Stop it.

445
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:21,858
Huh? Who're you?

00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:23,192
[EMI]
Kageyama?

447
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:24,442
[FRIEND 01A]
I remember him!

448
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:25,942
He's the guy who
froze like a statue

449
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:26,942
during his speech.

450
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:27,983
[FRIEND 01B]
Wait, he can talk?

Hey, what's your
problem, bowl-cut?

452
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:32,317
Emi asked you out
because she lost a bet.

453
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,025
Did you think she was serious?

454
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,192
Too funny!

455
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,192
Look, she's not your
girlfriend, doofus.

456
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:39,233
She worked hard
to write that novel.

457
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:40,900
It's mean to rip it up.

458
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:42,400
Huh?

459
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:44,608
You said it was just
to kill time, right?

460
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:46,775
U-Uh, yeah. Totally.

See? You heard her, loser.

462
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:51,483
Go on. Get lost.

463
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:54,442
Did you hear me? I said go.

464
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:56,608
[MOB]
I don't think of this as litter.

465
00:20:56,692 --> 00:21:00,233
If you're throwing it away,
I'm going to pick it up.

466
00:21:00,317 --> 00:21:02,358
I do have feelings.

When I listen, they remind me...

...what's important
in my heart.

See ya around.

476
00:21:27,275 --> 00:21:28,608
[FRIEND 01B]
Bye.

477
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,525
[EMI gasps]

478
00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:43,650
[EMI]
Aw...

479
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:46,025
What are we even doing?

480
00:21:46,108 --> 00:21:47,983
Wanna chase 'em down?

481
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:53,400
[EMI]
But, seriously... Thank you.

482
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:54,608
And don't worry.

483
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:56,733
I can just write another one.

484
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:04,317
[gasps]

485
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,150
By the way, I'm a psychic.

486
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,108
[EMI]
Thank you, Kageyama.

487
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,900
Nice one, Mob.

488
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:53,775
[DIMPLE] Wait a minute,
Mob, are you for real?

489
00:22:53,858 --> 00:22:55,317
If something that
fun was going on,

490
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,900
you should've called me!

491
00:22:56,983 --> 00:22:58,900
Besides, it's not
every day you show

492
00:22:58,983 --> 00:23:00,775
somebody your psychic
powers, you know!

493
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:02,150
Seriously!

494
00:23:02,233 --> 00:23:04,608
So! What happened after that?

495
00:23:04,692 --> 00:23:05,692
What do you mean?

496
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:07,442
I mean with this Emi girl!

497
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:10,775
Did she change her mind when
she found out what you can do?

498
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:13,275
Maybe even fall in love
with you for real?

499
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,483
Come on, spill it.

500
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,358
She's not that kind of girl.

501
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:18,192
My powers wouldn't
change things.

502
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:19,483
Honestly?

503
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:22,150
That blows my mind.

504
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:24,233
[EMI]
That was unbelievable.

505
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,192
Oh, Kageyama. You're so amazing.

506
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:32,775
[gasps]

507
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:36,400
[EMI] A middle school kid
with psychic powers.

508
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:42,733
[DIMPLE]
Whoa, hold up.

509
00:23:42,817 --> 00:23:45,400
You're saying you fell
for another love letter?

510
00:23:45,483 --> 00:23:46,983
Okay, that settles it!

511
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:48,067
You really do need me

512
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,733
as your advisor
on every decision!

513
00:23:51,817 --> 00:23:53,400
From now on, no matter
where you go,

514
00:23:53,483 --> 00:23:55,358
I'll always be with you.

515
00:23:55,442 --> 00:23:57,150
That's kinda creepy...

516
00:23:57,233 --> 00:24:00,150
[DIMPLE] You offer a guy a hand,
and what do ya get? Figures...

517
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:06,525
[REIGEN] It's time to explore
some urban legends!

518
00:24:06,608 --> 00:24:08,900
The human-faced dog,
Dash Granny, Red Raincoat,

519
00:24:08,983 --> 00:24:10,317
the Dragger, and more!

520
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,733
Mob, you handle the rest!

521
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,317
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho</i>
<i>100 II</i> , episode two:

522
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,858
"Urban Legends:
Encountering Rumors."

523
00:24:15,942 --> 00:24:18,608
Watching part II as it airs?
That's an excellent decision!
