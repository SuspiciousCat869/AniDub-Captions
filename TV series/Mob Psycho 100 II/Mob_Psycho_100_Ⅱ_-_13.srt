1
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:48,067
[MOB] Now I'll be able to
hit you with everything...

2
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,817
All my power...

3
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,858
...and all my rage.

Is that it?

6
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,983
Looks like this is finally
getting interesting!

00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:19,150

8
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:28,192
[laughs]

9
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:29,942
Look at you!

10
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,525
You're enjoying this,
too, aren't you?

11

[MOB laughs]

12
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:38,358
[KOYAMA]
What the hell is going on?

13
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:40,775
They're on a totally
different level.

[BOSS laughs]

15
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:46,483
[BOSS] As good and righteous
as you try to sound,

16
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,983
deep down, you're
the same as me.

[MOB grunts]

Shige!

19
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:57,192
[BOSS] How does it feel to be
released from your shackles?

20
00:02:57,275 --> 00:03:00,192
We are freer than
anyone else in the world!

21

[MOB whimpers]

26
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,525
[MOB] How...? How could
I be so foolish?

27
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:27,192
What's wrong with me?!

28
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:29,608
It may have only
been for a moment...

29
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:32,317
...but I let this
power control me!

30
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,650
You're so emotionally unstable.

31
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,150
At this rate, you'll
never catch up to me,

32
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:41,983
no matter how far
you go to do so.

33
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:45,442
I am the best in the world!

34
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,233
[MOB]
I don't get it.

35
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:51,150
How did your life end up
being so empty and hollow?

36
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:52,817
Though I suppose I
can't really judge you

37
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,983
for the life you chose.

38
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,775
You were just unlucky,
that's all.

39
00:03:57,858 --> 00:03:58,650
Ha.

40
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:00,275
You're joking, right?

41
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:01,733
There's no one in
this whole world

42
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:04,692
who's as lucky... as me!

43
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:08,733
Heaven bestowed these
powers upon me

44
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:11,067
and made all of you
extras in my story,

45
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,692
solely here to make
my star shine!

46
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:16,400
[MOB]
Is that so?

47
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:18,900
Then it wasn't luck
that you were missing.

48
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:20,775
It was bonds.

49
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:22,358
What did you say?

50
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:23,942
I mean that, in your world,

51
00:04:24,025 --> 00:04:26,608
you were the only
one who existed.

52
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:29,817
You lived in total solitude.

53
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,775
I know how that feels.

54
00:04:31,858 --> 00:04:35,358
A life of loneliness,
one I want to forget...

55
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:38,983
I don't understand.

56
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:40,275
What is this?

57
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:42,067
Why are you crying?

58
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:47,025
[MOB] You might not believe
me when I say this,

59
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:48,317
but it's true.

60
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,525
I really don't wanna hurt you.

61
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:51,692
[BOSS]
Tsk!

62
00:05:12,942 --> 00:05:14,233
I'm sorry...

[REIGEN]
What in the hell is going on?

65
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:25,358
[DIMPLE]
I have no idea.

66
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:28,108
The president's aura
has suddenly vanished.

67
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:30,525
Does that mean
it's finally over?

68
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:32,483
Yes! Way to go, Mob!

69
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:33,692
[TAKEUCHI]
Impressive.

70
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:35,733
Hard to believe that
boy's actually human.

71
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:36,817
That's true.

72
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,733
He's just a normal
middle school kid.

73
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:40,233
[RITSU]
You used a tremendous amount

74
00:05:40,317 --> 00:05:42,858
of power once again.
Didn't you, brother?

75
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:43,942
[SHO]
It's not over yet.

76
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:45,025
[gasps]

77
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:48,025
My dad's aura didn't disappear.

78
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:49,733
It only changed.

79
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,025
[SHO]
He mentioned to me before...

80
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:55,942
When he's under a lot of stress,

81
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:58,233
that's when he's truly awakened.

82

[BOSS yells]

85
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:32,608
This is completely
incomprehensible.

86
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:36,233
How can one man's powers
be so incredibly immense?

87
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:37,358
[DIMPLE]
Shigeo...

88
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:38,733
This is the one
time you shouldn't

89
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:40,942
try to do the impossible.

90
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,733
[TERUKI] He's already
using way more energy

91
00:06:42,817 --> 00:06:44,858
than he did when beat me.

92
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:47,608
[REIGEN]
If you can't win,

93
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:48,900
then run.

94
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:51,942
You're not responsible
for any of this.

95
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,650
Mob.

96
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:55,150
[sighs]

97
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:57,858
I've never felt
like this before.

98
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:00,400
Now wake up.

99
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:02,025
If you think you're going
to give up after that,

100
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:03,983
you're sadly mistaken.

101
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:07,400
Open your eyes!

102
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:08,275
No, I'm done.

00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:09,233
[gasps]

104
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:10,817
I hate to admit it...

105
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,192
...but I'm just
not strong enough.

106
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:14,817
I don't have what
it takes to show you

107
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,900
a new path to follow
in life. Sorry.

108
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:19,400
[BOSS]
Huh?!

109
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:22,108
You're the one who awakened
these destructive impulses!

110
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,525
Now you're going to have
to deal with them!

111
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:26,442
It's too late to
crawl off and hide

112
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:28,067
in your shell now!

113

[BOSS gasps]

114
00:07:34,817 --> 00:07:36,358
[MOB]
I give up.

115
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,567
[MOB] I hoped you could
turn over a new leaf

116
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,317
and become a better person...

117
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,317
...but that hope is gone.

118

[BOSS yells]

119
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,900
It appears that...

[BOSS sputters]

121
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:51,858

123
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:55,733
...each other quite a bit.

124
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:57,233
Yes.

125
00:07:57,317 --> 00:08:00,233
But I failed at being
a good influence on you.

126
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:02,900
So that's it. At this
point, we both lose.

This is...

00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:16,442

I think I'm about to die.

Well done, kid.

[MOB]
No, this is nothing...

136
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:30,817
It doesn't come close to the
fear of losing all I have.

Whoa! He's alive!

151
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:53,733

too much energy

152
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:55,067
and self-destructed!

a massive amount of energy.

It's just gonna keep
growing and churning...

...until it explodes
like a bomb!

And it looks like there won't
be any way to contain it.

in that if we stay.

00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:24,775
Our president who was trying
to take over the world.

167
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,275
[HATORI] Just shut up
and run! You're gonna die!

168
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:30,108
[DIMPLE] Hey, wait a second!
Where's Shigeo?!

169
00:10:30,192 --> 00:10:31,275
Huh?!

170
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,650
[BOSS]
You made the right decision.

171
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,400
There's no avoiding this.

172
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:37,983
You have to sever
the energy source

173
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:39,983
before the explosion happens...

174
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:42,775
...by putting an end to my life.

175
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:44,067
[gasps]

176
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,317
Wait, what are you doing?

177
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,150
Containing the explosion.

178
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:50,442
So in the end, not
only were you unable

179
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,608
to defeat me, but you
also couldn't save

180
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:54,483
your friends or even yourself.

181
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,358
Such a tragedy.

182
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:58,067
Someone with your
abilities should've

183
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,067
been able to handle this better.

184
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,692
I may have powers, but they
don't fix everything.

185
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:06,150
And honestly,
that's fine with me.

186
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,108
Huh?

187
00:11:07,192 --> 00:11:08,692
I still have a choice.

188
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:11,733
And I control my own destiny.

189
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:13,483
I get to be the protagonist.

190
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:14,942
It's my life.

191
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,692
[gasps]

192
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:19,192
[MOB]
That's why I chose to be here.

193
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:21,317
No matter how much
I dislike you,

194
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,317
I can't just leave you here
to suffer on your own.

195
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,317
That would be too sad.

196
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,900
And that's why I'm staying.

197
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,692
[BOSS]
What are you planning to do

198
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,900
with that filthy cat?

199
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:36,233
Aw, come on now.

200
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:37,733
After all, the poor
little thing was drenched

201
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:39,442
and shivering out in the rain.

202
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:40,817
And besides...

203
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,817
It'll help Sho learn
to be a gentle boy.

204
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,733
I mean, he is going
to grow up watching you.

205
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:49,900
We need to be gentle. Gentle.

206
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:50,900
I don't understand!

207
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:53,025
Why did you have
to be so violent?!

208
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:54,817
[BOSS]
Simple: it's pragmatic.

209
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,108
To lead an organization,

210
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:58,150
I need to establish
my dominance.

211
00:11:58,233 --> 00:12:01,025
You can't control people's
hearts with psychic powers!

212
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:04,067
You're wrong. True
power is absolute.

213
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,983
And, as long as I have it,

214
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:07,900
people will believe in me.

215
00:12:07,983 --> 00:12:10,400
Maybe some, but not everyone.

216
00:12:10,483 --> 00:12:11,525
[BOSS]
Everyone.

217
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:13,025
Even our gentle little Sho

218
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,067
is starting to take an
interest in what I can do.

219
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,442
[WIFE]
Goodbye.

220
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:24,150
[BOSS]
What happened? When did I...?

221
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:27,400
--[MOB screams]
--[BOSS gasps]

222

[grunting]

223
00:12:28,608 --> 00:12:30,358
[MOB]
If I can just absorb it...

224
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:32,650
[BOSS] Don't do it!
You'll only end up--

225
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:34,567
[yells]

226
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,900
[gasps]

227
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:38,775
[MOB] You wanted to
apologize, didn't you?!

228
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,358
Then you need to say it
loud and clear!

229
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:45,233
[screams]

230
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:48,150
You have to...

231
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:50,025
The same goes for me!

232
00:12:50,108 --> 00:12:53,358
I need to tell someone how
I feel about them, too!

233
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:18,858
[REIGEN]
Mob...

234
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,942
[TERUKI muffled]
Kageyama!

235
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:29,942
[RITSU]
Shige!

236
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:31,983
[DIMPLE]
Hey! Wake up!

237
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:32,983
[TERUKI]
Can you hear us?

238
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:34,108
Say something!

239
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:35,025
Shigeo!

240
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:37,733
Brother, please!

241
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,775
He's coming around!

242
00:13:39,858 --> 00:13:41,442
Let's dig him out.

243
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:46,900
[TERUKI]
Thank goodness you're okay.

244
00:13:46,983 --> 00:13:48,692
[REIGEN]
Unbelievable.

245
00:13:48,775 --> 00:13:51,942
Anyway, the sooner we can
get outta here, the better.

246
00:13:52,025 --> 00:13:53,275
Can ya walk?

247
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:54,525
I think so...

248
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:56,525
[RITSU] Every one of our
wounds have been healed.

249
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:58,525
Our clothes are
in shambles, though.

250
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:00,233
Huh. Yeah, you're right.

251
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:01,442
What's up with that?

252
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:03,108
There, on the left
side of your chest.

253
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:04,400
[MOB]
Huh?

254
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:07,192
[DIMPLE] Pretty bold
fashion statement, kid...

255
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:08,775
I gotta say, Kageyama,

256
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:11,025
you never cease to
amaze me, ya know that?

257
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:12,192
Couldn't have picked
a better rival

258
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:13,775
to go up against.

259
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:16,317
Don't go wandering
off too far, okay?

260
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:25,608
[MOB] This ground...
It's not concrete.

261
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:28,150
My head is still spinning.

262
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:30,358
The sky seems cramped.

263
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:31,900
Where are we?

264
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:33,650
[REIGEN]
There's the exit.

265
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:36,275
Watch out for fallin' objects.

266
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:37,858
[TERUKI]
It's quiet.

267
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:40,608
I'm surprised there aren't any
news 'copters flying around.

268
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:41,858
Well, can you blame them?

269
00:14:41,942 --> 00:14:43,275
I wouldn't come
anywhere near here

270
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:45,317
without knowing
if it's safe yet.

271
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,483
[MOB] Everything does seem
kinda quiet, though.

272
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:48,942
What's going on?

273
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:50,733
[REIGEN] I seriously
thought you were a goner

274
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:53,775
back there, Mob. Pretty scary.

275
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:55,483
I was sure ground
zero would've been

276
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:57,733
totally eviscerated.

277
00:14:57,817 --> 00:14:59,025
Uh--

278
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:01,483
What the hell is that?

279
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,775
But what appeared
there happened to be...

280
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:04,733
Uh--

281
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:05,733
Hey!

282
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:07,650
[RITSU]
Whoa, Shige! Take it easy!

283
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:08,775
Can you walk?

284
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:10,317
'Cause your body's
been through a lot.

285
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,067
Don't worry, I'm okay.

286
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,400
No broken bones or anything.

287
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:17,025
But lately, whenever
I use a lot of power,

288
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:19,775
I have a hard time
staying awake afterward.

289
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:21,150
[RITSU]
Huh?

290
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:25,942
In that case, let me
carry you a bit.

291
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,608
You get some rest.

292
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,567
[RITSU] But, where do you
plan on carrying him?

293
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,192
Our house is...

294
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:33,442
Sorry.

295
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:35,358
He'll be able to fix up
your house good as new,

296
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:37,192
but he'll need three
days to do it.

297
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:39,233
Just three days?!

298
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,483
[REIGEN] Why don't you guys
crash at my place?

299
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,483
It'll be cramped,

300
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,733
but I'm sure we
can make it work.

301
00:15:45,817 --> 00:15:47,400
Jeez! What's with the face?

302
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:49,317
I'm just tryin' to help!

303
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,525
Yeah, don't worry
about me. I'm good.

304
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:56,983
[RITSU] Would you mind if we
stopped by the school first?

305
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:58,525
[REIGEN]
At this hour?

306
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:01,275
[RITSU] There should be a spare
tracksuit in the club room.

307
00:16:04,525 --> 00:16:05,775
[REIGEN]
Oh.

308
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:07,858
Good call.

309
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:09,483
[RITSU] I wonder if they'd
mind if I borrowed

310
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,233
one for myself, too.

311
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:13,192
I really shouldn't
without asking.

312
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:15,483
Tracksuit thieves! Stop!

313
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:16,400
[MOB]
Oh...

314
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:17,733
Hey, Captain.

315
00:16:17,817 --> 00:16:19,775
[REIGEN]
I think I just peed a little.

316
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:22,233
[GODA]
You startled me.

317
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:24,358
I stopped by to grab
some dumbbells.

318
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,817
Wasn't expecting to see
anyone at this hour.

319
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,942
Sorry 'bout that.
You gave us a scare, too.

320
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:31,483
It's all good, I get it.

321
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:34,525
Hang on just a sec, okay?

322
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:37,358
Hey, how's it going?
Question for ya.

323
00:16:39,192 --> 00:16:40,733
So, uh what's everyone from

324
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:42,858
the Body Improvement
Club doing here?

325
00:16:42,942 --> 00:16:44,567
We were just stopping by to--

326
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,442
Bein' here this late
gave me an idea!

327
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:48,067
The Body Improvement
Club will now start

328
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,067
a three-day, four-night

Hang on. We're here to--

331
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:55,275
We should always
help each other out

332
00:16:55,358 --> 00:16:56,483
when we're in need!

333
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,025
True, but we're really
tired and we just--

I'm sure you wanna sleep

335

on a giant futon, don'tcha?!

336
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,942
No! A small one's just fine!

337
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:03,192
[GODA] There's enough
room for all of you

338
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:04,817
over at my granny's house!

339
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,525
You'll need to gather
and make your own food,

340
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,275
so it'll be excellent training!

341
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:10,358
And it's just a
90-minute jog away!

342
00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:11,483
Let's move out!

343
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,400
Wait! Reigen told us
earlier that we--!

344
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:14,567
That sounds great!

345
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,317
You guys take care, okay?

346
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,567

Man. Rough one.

351
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:27,817
I totally forgot!

352
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,233
I should've gone over to
Reigen's place after all.

They say seeing is believing,

but honestly, I still
don't believe it.

No kidding.

357
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:45,483
I mean, how do you even go about
growing something like that?

That's incredible!

Uh, well...

369
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:13,733
If you're asking if we were

370
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:16,317
directly involved, I guess
I'd have to say no.

371
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,150
I mean, we basically
were, though.

with your research and
you actually develop

my favorite part of all this...

time with you guys.

Well, let's see...

429
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:12,983
Under normal circumstances,
he'd be executed.

430

But, who knows?

431
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:17,692
They might decide to keep him
alive as a research subject.

432
00:20:17,775 --> 00:20:19,108
[SERIZAWA]
Why'd he have to say something

433

so harsh to his son like that?

434

[JOSEPH] Either way,
it's not my call to make...

Listen.

439
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:33,400
I never actually considered
any of you as my comrades.

440
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,775
So don't worry about me.

441
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:37,817
People are going to
try to manipulate you

442
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,233
because of your lack
of self-confidence.

443
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:43,275
Make sure you don't let them.

And, Sho.

445
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:46,608
I was hoping you'd
have the opportunity

00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:49,567
to see your mother again
and reconnect with her.

447
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,150
But it seems my pride
severed that possibility.

448
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:55,567
I'm truly sorry about that.

Don't be.

450
00:20:56,775 --> 00:20:59,150
I see Mom every now and then.

00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:01,483
Believe it or not,
she's always asking me

452
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,983
how you're doing.

453
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:04,150
It's too bad.

454
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:05,525
Really wish I
could've stopped you

455
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:08,233
before she found out
what you'd become.

456
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:09,858
When I called her this morning,

457
00:21:09,942 --> 00:21:12,025
she said she'd come
see you sometime.

458
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:14,150
So I wouldn't start thinking
this is all over with

459
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:15,483
if I were you.

460
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,233
You'll still get
an earful from Mom,

461
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,317
and believe me, you need it.

462
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:35,525
[BOSS] "People need
other people"... huh?

463
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:41,900
What? So it was only
a short circuit?

464
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:44,608
Apparently, a mouse
bit into some wires.

465
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:46,817
And since that's what
started the fire,

466
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,942
the insurance kicked in,
and bam! New office.

467
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:55,025
Which is great, except
for how boring it looks.

00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:57,025
Okay, Mob, do your thing.

469
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,150
Right.

I just remembered.

That's where I put
those broccoli seeds

from the farm job.

Broccoli seeds?

477
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:15,483
Oh, well, it doesn't really--

Master, you mean that's...!

482
00:22:23,817 --> 00:22:25,108
[REIGEN]
How about we play the

483
00:22:25,192 --> 00:22:28,192
"just forget you
ever saw this" game?

484
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:30,525
Anyway, this guy sure is late...

485
00:22:30,608 --> 00:22:32,525
Huh?

00:22:32,608 --> 00:22:34,233
[REIGEN]
Oh, there you are.

487
00:22:34,317 --> 00:22:35,400
Come in.

488
00:22:35,483 --> 00:22:36,817
I got lost along the way.

489
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,442
I'm really sorry.

490
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,942
Thanks for the
other day, Kageyama.

491
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:42,733
What's with the suit?

492
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:44,692
Wait, are you gonna work here?!

493
00:22:44,775 --> 00:22:45,983
[SERIZAWA]
Mm-hm.

494
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:48,525
Reigen was generous enough
to make me an offer.

495
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:51,817
He said it was something
that even I could handle.

496
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,233
And I figured it was the least

497
00:22:53,317 --> 00:22:56,442
I could do after Claw...
caused so much trouble.

498
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,025
Our goal is to try
and make a better

499
00:23:01,108 --> 00:23:03,608
tomorrow for everyone.
Are you with us?!

500
00:23:03,692 --> 00:23:06,108
Uh, yes, sir! I'll do my best!

501
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:07,817
The client's gonna be here soon.

502
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,817
But before they get here...

503
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,150
Huh?

504
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:13,983
Time to re-do your do.

505
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:15,775
Huh?

506
00:23:15,858 --> 00:23:18,817
Whoa! That's amazing.

507
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,317
--[REIGEN] Hmm.
--He seems so different.

508
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,733
[REIGEN] I guess he at least
looks like he can pull off

509
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:25,067
customer service now.

510
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,317
Hold on. Did you say
customer service?!

511
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,483
What should I do when
a customer comes around?!

512
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:31,108
What was your last job?

513
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:32,775
[SERIZAWA] Uh, if people
showed up, my orders were

514
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:35,650
to start attacking them
with my umbrella.

515
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:36,942
What the hell, dude?

516
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:39,150
Ah, well, we can
make it work. Oh!

517
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:40,275
If you have any questions,

518
00:23:40,358 --> 00:23:42,608
you can ask my
senior staff member.

519
00:23:42,692 --> 00:23:43,692
Your what?

520
00:23:43,775 --> 00:23:44,733
[REIGEN]
So, Mob.

521
00:23:44,817 --> 00:23:45,983
Think you could
show him the ropes?

522
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:47,858
At least until he's
out of training.

523
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:49,942
Huh?

524
00:23:50,025 --> 00:23:53,150
A pleasure to work with
you, Mr. Kageyama!

525
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:55,025
Huh? Oh, yeah.

526
00:23:55,108 --> 00:23:57,858
A pleasure to work
with you, too...

527
00:23:57,942 --> 00:23:59,650
[MOB]
What should I do?

528
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:02,400
Now I'm getting nervous.

529
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,317
[GUY 13C]
Uh, pardon me. Is this...?

530
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,650
[REIGEN]
Oh, hello there!

531
00:24:05,733 --> 00:24:08,567
Really sorry about the mess.
Please have a seat.

532
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,733
Serizawa, get our
guest some tea.

533
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:11,900
[SERIZAWA]
T-Tea?

534
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,817
I-I'm sorry, I've never
made that before.

535
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,567
[DIMPLE]
We are so screwed.
