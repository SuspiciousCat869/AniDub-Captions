1
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,567
[SERIZAWA]
Leave this place.

2
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,983
I don't want you to get hurt.

3
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:49,692
And take this guy
with you when you go.

4
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:52,900
He's supposed to be a hostage,
but I feel bad for him.

5
00:01:52,983 --> 00:01:55,317
[MOB]
Oh, it's the prime minister.

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,067
[SERIZAWA]
What? Is <i>that</i> who you are?

7
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,192
So, I'm free to go, then?

8
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:01,692
Yes, sir.

9
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,192
Holy cow.

10
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:06,525
I just talked to
the prime minister!

11
00:02:06,608 --> 00:02:08,608
You're part of the group
that abducted him.

12
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:10,067
How could you not know?

13
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,400
[SERIZAWA]
Well... I don't really watch TV.

14
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:14,067
So I guess that means...

15
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,692
...most people think we're
the bad guys, don't they?

16
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:18,858
[MOB] But you are.
Look at how much damage

17
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:20,567
you've done to the city.

18
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,817
[SERIZAWA]
It's fine.

19
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,108
The president said most people

20
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:25,150
had already
evacuated beforehand.

21
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:26,233
The president?

22
00:02:26,317 --> 00:02:27,192
Yeah, that's right.

23
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:28,733
He's the one who hired me on.

24
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:31,358
In fact, considering the
hell that was my life,

25
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,275
you could say he rescued me.

26
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:41,108
What a pig sty.

27
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:44,108
You've lived like
this for 15 years?

28
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:45,567
Maybe. Who're you?

29
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,817
My name is Suzuki
and I'm here to help.

30
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,108
Your mother's concerned,
so she asked me to talk to you.

31
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:53,400
[SERIZAWA]
Great. Another counselor.

32
00:02:53,483 --> 00:02:55,192
Look, man. Don't try
to get any closer,

33
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,442
or you'll get hurt.

34
00:02:56,525 --> 00:02:58,858
I'm not exactly normal.

35
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:01,733
Yes, I know. I hear
that you're an esper.

36
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:03,733
I understand you better
than you may think.

37
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,150
[SERIZAWA]
Yeah, I'll bet. Go away.

38
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:07,983
[BOSS]
And why would I do that?

39
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:09,900
Why don't you tell me
how you're feeling?

40
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:12,775
[SERIZAWA]
N-No... Don't say anything else.

41
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:15,817
Please, I'm begging you.
Don't annoy me.

42
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,483
[BOSS]
It must be hard not being able

43
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:19,817
to make friends
because people think

44
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,692
your powers are creepy.

45
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:21,817
[SERIZAWA]
Stop it!

46
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,650
Don't act like you
know what it's like!

47
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:25,525
Just... Just go away!

48
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:27,275
[BOSS] People bullied you
out of your place

49
00:03:27,358 --> 00:03:29,025
in society, didn't they?

50
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,650
[screams]

51
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,942
[SERIZAWA]
Get out!

52
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:36,400
[gasps]

53
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,192
[BOSS]
You see, I'm an esper, too.

54
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:41,608
I want you to come with me.

55
00:03:41,692 --> 00:03:43,567
But I can't leave this room.

56
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,692
Whenever I do, I get dizzy.

57
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:50,108
[BOSS]
It was raining outside earlier.

58
00:03:50,192 --> 00:03:52,483
But now, I'd like to give
this umbrella to you.

59
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,233
Just imagine that
when you're under it,

60
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,692
it's the same as
being in your room.

61
00:03:56,775 --> 00:03:58,400
There's no reason to worry.

62
00:03:58,483 --> 00:04:00,775
You'll be fine
if you're with me.

63
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:04,525
I'll show you how to harness
and control your powers.

64
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:06,608
[SERIZAWA] After that,
I became an upper echelon

65
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:10,108
employee of Claw and regained
my place in society.

66
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:11,942
Don't you think
that's kinda weird?

67
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:13,192
[SERIZAWA]
Huh?

68
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:16,442
I'm no expert, but it
just seems wrong to me.

69
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:17,525
Think about it.

70
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,692
Aren't you basically
being used here?

71
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:20,775
Say what?

72
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:22,400
[DIMPLE]
Look who's talkin'!

73
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:25,817
How rude! What a completely
horrible thing to say!

74
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,025
[MOB]
You're the one who's horrible.

75
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:29,567
If this was all you
were going to do,

76
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,400
you should've just
stayed a shut-in.

77
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:35,067
Don't you care how many
lives you've ruined?

78
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,442
[SERIZAWA]
The president told me that

79
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:40,442
world domination always
involves certain sacrifices.

80
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:42,400
[MOB]
Do you believe that, too?

81
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:43,942
Okay, that's enough.

82
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:46,192
I'm going to have to
ask you to leave again.

83
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:48,483
No, Serizawa. I won't.

84
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,733
You chose the wrong
person to follow.

85
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:57,733
Are you all right?

86
00:04:57,817 --> 00:04:58,608
That umbrella...

87
00:04:58,692 --> 00:04:59,817
Yeah, I noticed.

88
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,275
It's shrouded in some
pretty insane power.

89
00:05:02,358 --> 00:05:04,233
[SERIZAWA] When I'm
under this, I feel safe.

90
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:06,192
It's just like being in my room.

91
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:08,150
If we can take that
thing away from him...

92
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:10,692
...then he'll lose
all his strength.

93
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:11,858
[SERIZAWA grunts]

94
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,358
Trying to immobilize me
isn't gonna work!

95
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:28,025
[gasps] That hurt.

96
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:31,358
Oh, uh, sorry. Are you okay?

97
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:33,150
You were faking?

98
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,192
[MOB]
Now, Dimple!

99
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:35,483
You got it!

100
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:39,067
[SERIZAWA screams]

101
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,025
Oh, crap!

102
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,275
He goes that nuts after only

103
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:46,233
a few seconds
without his umbrella?

104
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:48,942
He must have incredible anxiety.

105
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:51,358
He finally found someone
who understood him

106
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:53,692
and had no choice but to follow.

107
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:55,358
He never stood a chance
against someone

108
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:58,400
who used that
to their advantage.

109
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,525
I have to tell him.

110
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:02,692
I'm sorry to say this,
but your president

111
00:06:02,775 --> 00:06:04,192
didn't give you peace.

112
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:06,400
He implanted the idea
that you can't survive

113
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:09,275
on your own to chain you
to the organization.

114
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:12,483
[laughs] So are you some
kind of counselor?

115
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:14,608
You can't rejoin
the world this way.

116
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:16,025
At this rate, if anything,

117
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:18,192
you won't ever be
able to come back.

118
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:20,025
Like a kid who still
has his whole life

119
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:22,192
ahead of him knows how I feel.

120
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:23,483
Then tell me...

121
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:26,317
What in the hell am I
supposed to do then?!

122
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,192
No one ever understood this
power I was born with!

123
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:30,358
People thought I was creepy,

124
00:06:30,442 --> 00:06:32,567
so I'd lose control
and destroy things!

125
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,358
Then they'd scold me
and I'd lose control again!

126
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:38,608
I've even accidentally sent
my mother flying before!

127
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:41,317
I never knew when
I might totally snap!

128
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,983
There was never anybody
around who I could talk to.

129
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:47,442
'Cause I just wanted to...

130
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:51,067
I dunno... I just wanted...

131
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,442
I ju...

132
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:54,900
I just wanted to have friends.

133
00:06:57,525 --> 00:07:00,108
I've made some friends
in this company.

134
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:02,275
And they're espers,
just like me!

135
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:04,150
You'd never understand!

136
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:09,400
[MOB]
Of course I do.

137
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:11,150
But, those people
aren't what you think.

138
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:12,233
Huh?

139
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:14,650
[MOB]
Because I actually have friends.

140
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,067
That's how I know.

141
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,275
They aren't your friends.
They're liars.

142
00:07:18,358 --> 00:07:19,275
[stammers]

143
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:22,608
Shut up! I'm warning you!

144
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,858
This isn't good, Shigeo!
That's a lot of friggin' energy!

145
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:27,608
I won't let you go any further!

146
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:29,233
Those are the
president's orders!

147
00:07:29,317 --> 00:07:31,483
He trusts me and I don't
wanna let him down!

148
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:32,525
Don't kid yourself!

149
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:34,317
This has nothing
to do with trust!

150
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:37,150
He doesn't really care!

151
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:38,358
He's just using you!

152
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:40,567
No! The president got
me out of that room

153
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,942
and gave me a reason to live!

154
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:45,275
Maybe, but he doesn't
see you as a person!

155
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:47,483
Why would you say that?

156
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,692
[MOB]
You said that you didn't wanna

157
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:50,483
hurt anybody, didn't you?

158
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,108
Then you're just like I am.

159
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:54,400
It might be hard
for you to admit,

160
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:56,567
but you have to know
you're wrong.

161
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,567
Shut up!

162
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,733
Listen...

163
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:02,567
I'll be your friend--
you have my word!

164
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,692
[yells]

165
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,900
--[DIMPLE] Huh?
--[SERIZAWA] Uh...

166
00:08:05,983 --> 00:08:08,025
Whoops. I shot at him.

167
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:11,900
Shigeo!

168
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:13,567
But I went all out!

169
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:20,733
What?!

170
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:26,400
It feels like you're
sucking up part of my energy.

171
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:28,775
I can sense everything
you're feeling.

172
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:31,650
So much of your energy is sad.

173
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:34,567
You took it and turned it
into your own power?

174
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,233
Yeah, I did. But, here.

175
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:37,817
You can have it back.

176
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,317
[SERIZAWA]
What am I seeing?

177
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Wait...

178
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:51,192
He's...

179
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:53,858
He's the same as me...

180
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,067
[BOSS]
Due to this little uprising

181
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,483
you and your friends led,

182
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:02,983
I'm going to have to
recruit more soldiers.

183
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:05,483
Please, Dad, you've
gotta stop this.

184
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:06,567
None of those guys

185
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,233
are of much help to you.
You know that.

186
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:10,442
Since you're my son,

187
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:13,275
I'm going to let you
in on a little secret.

188
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:16,025
The project of applying stress
to normal human beings

189
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:18,733
to awaken any ESP they may have?

190
00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:20,692
It was a failure.

191
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:23,358
Even if it did happen to
stir up some latent skills,

192
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:26,483
the results were
insignificant at best.

193
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,817
[SHO]
But, wait. I saw them.

194
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,858
Are you calling those
powers insignificant?

195
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:33,525
You mean the ones
they're out there using

196
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:35,233
like there's no tomorrow?

197
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:37,817
Those happen to be my powers.

198
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,067
I'm able to share my abilities
with anyone I choose.

199
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,983
At the same time, I can absorb

200
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:45,317
other people's
abilities as my own.

201
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,275
That's what gives
me the upper hand,

202
00:09:47,358 --> 00:09:49,983
and I've kept this
secret from everyone.

203
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,358
You're saying you gave
those 600 soldiers

204
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:53,733
out there your power?

205
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:55,275
[BOSS]
And that's just a mere fraction

206
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:58,775
of the energy I've
accumulated over the years.

207
00:09:58,858 --> 00:10:02,400
But just because it's a fraction
doesn't make it any less vital.

208
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:05,733
I'll be reclaiming my energy
from those who have lost.

209
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,692
I finally get it.

210
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:22,567
My dad's not human.

211
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,108
He's a monster
made up of energy!

212
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,733
There's a lesson that can
be learned here, Sho.

213
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:30,317
And that would be that
only one absolute being

214
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,650
can be the true
protagonist of this world.

215
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,150
[SHO]
Absolute being?

216
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:38,650
[gasps]

217
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:40,400
[SHO]
Wait! You're--!

218
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,608
You're Ritsu's older brother.

219
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,608
If you're here,
then that must mean

220
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:55,150
my detonator went off
the way I hoped it would.

221
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:58,525
Does that mean you're the one
who set my house on fire?

222
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:00,858
Hmph. You're probably
pissed about that.

223
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:02,733
Either way, I'd suggest
you leave here.

224
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:05,942
There isn't anyone in the world
who can defeat my dad.

225
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:07,442
I'm not mad anymore.

226
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:09,900
I'm sure there's a lot
you're trying to deal with.

227
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:11,358
I mean, look at what
your own father

228
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:13,858
has done to you.

229
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:15,775
And who are you?

230
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:17,608
[MOB] He's been worried
about you losing control

231
00:11:17,692 --> 00:11:20,358
for a long time now. I can tell.

232
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:23,650
Because my younger brother
was afraid of me, too.

233
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:26,317
[SHO]
Whoa... He's changed.

234
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,733
[BOSS]
Don't pretend like you know

235
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,900
what's going on with our family.

236
00:11:29,983 --> 00:11:31,942
Serizawa filled me in a little.

237
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,442
He said that your son was
up here trying to stop you.

238
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:37,233
He said you'd
beaten him so badly,

239
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:40,483
he couldn't bear to watch
and came downstairs...

240
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,692
He felt so pathetic
for not stepping in,

241
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:44,983
he wanted to disappear.

242
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:47,608
So then Serizawa
lost, I take it?

243
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:49,817
That moron must've
gotten sloppy.

244
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,192
No, you're wrong.

245
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:54,025
Human relationships
aren't so easily defined

246
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:57,067
as just "winners" and "losers."

247
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,650
It was the president who finally

248
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:01,942
got me to leave that room.
I'm grateful to him.

249
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:04,192
Even so, I don't
understand the need

250
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:05,692
for us to hurt people.

251
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:07,233
I've been too scared
to think about it,

252
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:08,942
so I just didn't.

253
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:11,858
But if my happiness can only
come from someone else's tears,

254
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:14,858
then it's not something
I want in the first place.

255
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,942
Thank you for making
me realize that.

256
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,900
Apparently, trash will never be
anything more than trash.

257
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:25,233
So be it.

258
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:27,692
I've never really counted
on other people anyway.

259
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,817
Bonding with them is an empty
and meaningless gesture.

260
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,275
And at the end of the day,

261
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:34,567
I am wholly complete
while on my own.

262
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,150
But that's not true at all.

263
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:37,775
You just don't get it.

264
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,775
Everyone grows because
of the encounters

265
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:41,525
they have with others.

266
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:44,108
People need other
people in their lives.

267
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:46,400
And, someday, you'll
need them, too.

268
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:49,650
When that day comes,
you're going to regret it.

269
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:50,983
Let me help you.

270
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:54,150
When you need somebody
to talk to, I'll be there.

271
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,483
You want to be a shoulder
I can lean on?

272
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,650
[BOSS chuckles]

273
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,442
Save that kind of talk
for the pathetic

274
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:00,900
weaklings of the world.

275
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:02,483
There's something
you should know.

276
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:04,025
My dad has the ability
to give people

277
00:13:04,108 --> 00:13:06,442
his energy while
stealing theirs.

278
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:08,192
On top of that,
he's got a massive

279
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:11,067
30-year stockpile of
energy at his disposal.

280
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,358
Meanwhile, I can
barely even move...

281
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:15,442
If that's the case,
maybe I can help you.

282
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:17,442
[SHO]
Hm?

283
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:19,400
[gasps] Amazing...

284
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:20,567
[BOSS gasps]

285
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,483
[BOSS]
He has the same power as me?

286
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:23,692
Can you move?

287
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:26,442
[SHO] Y-Yeah, I can
sorta stand, at least.

288
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:27,608
Good to hear.

289
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:29,317
I suggest you evacuate.

290
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,275
I'm going to do my best to--

291
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:33,317
[BOSS]
You are my rival.

292
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,858
[grunts]

293
00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:35,858
[SHO]
Dad! No!

294
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:36,983
[SHO yells]

295
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,358
Stay out of this.

296
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,483
He has the potential to
become my mortal enemy.

297
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:44,817
Listen. I only came
here to talk to you.

298
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,442
Just give it up, Shigeo!

299
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,025
You can't talk to guys like him!

300
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:50,442
You're annoying.

301
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:52,108
Begone.

302
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:53,317
Dimple, no!

303
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:58,067
[TERUKI]
Was it really a good idea

304
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,775
to let him go in alone?

305
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:01,400
I've never seen
my brother openly

306
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:04,233
call out his authority
like that before.

307
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:06,608
He looked like he was
in pain to me, though.

308
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:09,733
He's not usually the type
to charge into a fight.

309
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:11,067
What do you think, Reigen?

310
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,733
Any insight?

311
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:15,275
At first glance,
Mob may look unreliable,

312
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:16,983
but you can't deny his strength.

313
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:19,775
You're talking about his
insane telekinesis, right?

314
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,358
[REIGEN]
That's part of it.

315
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:23,983
But it's just one of the
qualities I'm referring to.

316
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:25,942
What makes him truly great

317
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:29,192
is his ability to tell people
exactly how he feels.

318
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:31,108
And that speaks to
their heart far more

319
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:32,900
than anything else could.

320
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:34,608
By expressing those feelings,

321
00:14:34,692 --> 00:14:37,025
Mob's honest nature
helps others--

322
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:38,275
Uh--

323
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:41,650
It's Dimple!

324
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:44,442
What's wrong? Are you
okay? Where's Mob?

325
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:47,858
I don't know, but things are
lookin' pretty bad here.

326
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:51,817
That Boss guy seemed
hell-bent on killing Shigeo.

327
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,525
[REIGEN]
Four-eyes. You got a sec?

328
00:14:53,608 --> 00:14:55,525
Huh?

329
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:58,192
Now, what was it you
wanted to tell me?

330
00:14:58,275 --> 00:14:59,442
[MOB] You said that
bonding with others

331
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,150
is empty and meaningless.

332
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,900
But, you couldn't be more wrong.

333
00:15:02,983 --> 00:15:04,358
No one's born complete.

334
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:06,025
Everybody's lacking something.

335
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:08,733
Helping each other is what
gives our lives meaning.

336
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:11,942
All of you are so
myopic and boring.

337
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:13,400
Even among those who happen

338
00:15:13,483 --> 00:15:16,275
to be blessed with
the gift of ESP,

339
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:18,858
my powers surpass each one.

340
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:20,442
When I came to
that realization,

341
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:22,567
it appeared as though
the entire world

342
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,358
could fit right in
the palm of my hand.

343
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:27,067
That was when I was
in middle school,

344
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,483
the same age you two are now.

345
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:31,192
While I followed my destiny,

346
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:34,067
you both let your minds put
a halt to all progress,

347
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,733
leaving you to live
the same boring,

348
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:38,858
mundane existence as the
powerless ones around you.

349
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:39,983
No.

350
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:41,275
You're the one who's been stuck

351
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:44,358
in the same mindset
since middle school.

352
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:45,942
There are far more unique people

353
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:48,067
in this world than
you seem to believe.

354
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,858
And just as many
views and outlooks.

355
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:52,733
No one should be able
to place a value

356
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:55,483
on another person's way of life.

357
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:58,775
Don't give me that "moral
high ground" routine.

358
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,733
I have no need to rely
on others to make up

359
00:16:00,817 --> 00:16:02,817
for any deficiencies I have

360
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,983
because I have the
ability to steal, use,

361
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:08,150
and rule as I see fit.

362
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,650
My goal in life is to leave
a huge mark upon this world.

363
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:14,983
And now is the time for
that goal come to fruition.

364
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:16,150
[grunts]

365
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:17,733
[SHO]
Hey. Listen.

366
00:16:17,817 --> 00:16:20,567
Don't worry about me.
Just finish him!

367
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,817
How foolish.

368
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,900
And to think I had
actually considered

369
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,192
letting you inherit the world
I was going to take over.

370
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:30,442
But apparently, Sho,
you have become a failure.

371
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,858
Hey...

372
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:39,817
[BOSS]
Are you angry on Sho's behalf?

373
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,108
[BOSS laughs]

374
00:16:41,192 --> 00:16:43,067
[BOSS]
You truly are a simple child.

375
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,692
You need to shut your mouth.

376
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:48,817
Still, I'm game. Show me
everything you've got.

377
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,775
[gasps]

378
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:53,400
[MOB]
Oh, man... This is rough...

379
00:17:02,942 --> 00:17:04,983
Stop it!

380
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,775
[groans]

381
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:09,275
[BOSS]
Watch carefully.

382
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:12,692
This is what happens
to those who are weak.

383
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:14,483
[groans]

384
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,650
[BOSS] You have some nerve
trying to lecture me

385
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:19,192
when you're so feeble.

386
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:21,108
You've wasted my time.

387
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:22,067
[REIGEN]
Don't move.

388
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,692
[BOSS]
Hmm?

389
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:26,900
This thing's loaded, by the way.

390
00:17:26,983 --> 00:17:28,900
[BOSS]
Sakurai's Jugan.

391
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:32,192
You're going to need much more
than that to threaten me.

392
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:34,900
M-Master...

393
00:17:34,983 --> 00:17:37,025
Mob, stay still.

394
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,317
I'm not sensing any kind
of power from you at all.

395
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
You'll stay out of this if you
know what's good for you.

396
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:47,858
Huh?

397
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,442
Apparently, you still
don't understand

398
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:52,192
how powerful I am.

399
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:53,108
[REIGEN]
Hey.

400
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:55,108
You still alive, Mob?

401
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,567
[REIGEN] I don't know
what I was thinking,

402
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,608
letting you go off
alone like that.

403
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:01,233
My mind was probably distracted

404
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:04,275
by all the weirdness
goin' on around me...

405
00:18:04,358 --> 00:18:06,692
I failed as a master.

406
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:07,942
You did well.

407
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:09,817
I'll buy you some <i>takoyaki</i>
on our way home.

408
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,317
He calls you "Master"?

409
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,900
Even though you lack the skills
to see how powerful I am?

410
00:18:14,983 --> 00:18:16,650
So you're also
somebody who tricks

411
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,400
others and steals from them.

412
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:20,025
Interesting.

413
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:22,358
[REIGEN]
Well, this is ironic.

414
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:24,733
Look, if you ask me,
you're pretty short-sighted.

415
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:26,650
'Cause you only see
unseen powers.

416
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:28,275
Gotta say, I feel sorry for ya.

417
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,733
[BOSS]
What's that supposed to mean?

418
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,692
I'm saying, ESP
is great and all,

419
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:34,650
but it's not the only cool
power people can have.

420
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:36,567
And that's going
to be your downfall.

421
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,233
Off the top of my head, I can
think of four ways to beat you.

422
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:41,233
[BOSS]
Really?

423
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:42,983
You should give
them a try, then.

424
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:44,983
Oh, no, I didn't mean me.

425
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:48,817
However, I do have a request.

426
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,817
Will you let me join your side?

427
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,067
[BOSS]
And what good does that do me?

428
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,900
[REIGEN] I could easily
persuade my student,

429
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:58,108
who's unconscious
there to do so, too.

430
00:18:58,192 --> 00:18:59,942
And all the guys on the ground.

431
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:01,983
That should be reason enough.

432
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:03,608
[BOSS]
Maybe if you tell me about these

433
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:05,525
methods of defeating me...

434
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:07,983
If you actually have any.

435
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:09,817
[REIGEN] Allow me to
fill you in on some powers

436
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,567
other than ESP that
you're not aware of.

437
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,150
As for the first one...

438
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:15,900
It's something that
espers should really

439
00:19:15,983 --> 00:19:18,025
be extremely cautious about.

440
00:19:18,108 --> 00:19:19,275
And that is...

441
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,733
...brute strength, ya moron!

442
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:23,150
[REIGEN gasps]

443
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:25,483
[BOSS] It makes sense you two
are master and student.

444
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,442
What a pair of fools.

445
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:28,317
[REIGEN]
Uh--

446
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Wait! Time out! I give up!

447
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:32,442
I'll do anything
you want me to.

448
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:35,817
You have put me in
an extremely foul mood.

449
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,817
[REIGEN] N-N-No, wait!
Let's talk about this!

450
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,817
[REIGEN gasps]

451
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,900
No!

452
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,400
What's going on up there?

453
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,900
Please be okay.

454
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:06,025
Made it just in time.

455
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:07,358
President.

456
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:09,733
For once in my life,
I'm trying to be courageous.

457
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:10,942
Serizawa.

458
00:20:11,025 --> 00:20:12,858
You've completely
betrayed me now.

459
00:20:12,942 --> 00:20:14,525
And you know what that means.

460
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:15,692
[MOB]
Forget it.

461
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:16,567
[gasps]

462
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,733
[MOB]
That's enough talk.

463
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:24,650
Huh...?

464
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:27,025
[MOB] Let me just tell
you one last thing.

465
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:30,775
Those who don't understand
the feelings of others...

466
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:32,692
Ah, what's the point?

467
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:35,525
Some people have to
learn the hard way.

468
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:36,817
Is that...?

469
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,650
It's my brother.

470
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:40,400
Shigeo...

471
00:20:40,483 --> 00:20:42,025
Mob just lost it.

472
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:45,358
Is... Is there anything I can
do to try and help you guys?

473
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:46,650
Hey, Serizawa.

474
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:49,025
Take my master and
the others and evacuate.

475
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:51,483
Your punishment comes first!

476
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,067
[yelps]

477
00:20:54,608 --> 00:20:55,733
[SERIZAWA]
Shigeo!

478
00:20:58,192 --> 00:20:58,942
Holy crap.

479
00:20:59,025 --> 00:20:59,817
Look!

[REIGEN, SERIZAWA scream]

481
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:03,733
Where's Shige?

482
00:21:03,817 --> 00:21:04,650
[gasps]

483
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:06,525
Are those plants?

484
00:21:13,442 --> 00:21:14,567
Look at that.

485
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,233
So, the boss really did
cast Serizawa aside.

486
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,442
Sorry, who?

487
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:21,150
I apologize, but I
definitely owe him.

488
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:22,525
[HATORI]
Don't do it, Minegishi!

489
00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:24,233
You don't wanna
piss off the boss!

490
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,817
Glad to see you're
alive, Hatori.

491
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,192
Minegishi, too...

492
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:29,733
Hmph!

493
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:32,775
It seems I'm now in a situation
where anybody can betray me.

494
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,733
It's back to the drawing
board, I suppose.

495
00:21:35,817 --> 00:21:37,192
Disappear.

496
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:44,400
[ALL yell]

497
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:47,942
Disappear. Disappear. Disappear.

498
00:21:48,025 --> 00:21:50,608
[BOSS cackles]

499
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:52,525
[yells]

500
00:21:52,608 --> 00:21:55,192
Well, you're enthusiastic,
aren't you?

501
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:03,983
You're too weak to challenge me.

502
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:06,983
I'm still only using ten
percent of my energy.

503
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:10,733
If that's your 100 percent,
then this is pointless.

504
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:11,942
[BOSS gasps]

505
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:18,025
What the hell is that?

506
00:22:20,108 --> 00:22:21,733
I see what's happening here.

507
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:24,400
You were provoking
an internal reaction.

508
00:22:24,483 --> 00:22:27,858
Now I'll be able to hit
you with everything.

509
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:29,858
All my power...

510
00:22:29,942 --> 00:22:32,025
...and all my rage!

511
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,358
[REIGEN] The final battle
begins between a furious

512
00:24:06,442 --> 00:24:08,567
Mob and the arrogant
energy demon, Suzuki.

513
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,817
Careful! Don't push
yourself too hard, Mob!

514
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,733
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho</i>
<i>100 II</i> : episode 13.

515
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:15,525
"Boss Fight ~The Final Light~."

516
00:24:15,608 --> 00:24:18,400
Watching the finale in real
time is an excellent decision.
