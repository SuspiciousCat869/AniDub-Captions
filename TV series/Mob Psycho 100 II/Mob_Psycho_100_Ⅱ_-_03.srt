[NARRATOR]
The "Spirits and Such" home page

00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:16,358
was surprisingly well-received!

3
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:17,900
That resulted in more and more

4
00:00:17,983 --> 00:00:20,108
new clients with
legitimate requests

00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:23,900
for investigations
and exorcisms.

6
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:27,733
But, in hindsight, some of these
new opportunities were jobs that

00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:30,775

in the first place.

I mean... even if it's a lie,

59
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:01,983
in his mind, he still
managed to put

a curse on somebody.

At first, I just thought

it was some creepy stalker.
So I called the police.

three of us are a family...

317
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,192
We only had a few
short years together

318
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:20,900
before we died.

319
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:22,900
But now that we're spirits,

320
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:26,608
we can continue to exist
peacefully in this place.

321
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,400
We've done nothing wrong.

322
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:30,900
We just want to
spend a little more

324

Once we've had that,
I promise you, we'll disappear.

So please... let us
remain in peace.

Nope. Not a thing.

Look, there's no need
to exorcise them.

They say they won't
do anything wrong.

It creeps me out just
knowing they're here!

You've gotten rid of all kinds
of evil spirits before.

These aren't evil.

Why not just kill these

if the clients die,

powers to curse someone...

474
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,525
Or use them to commit crimes
or wrongdoings of any kind...

475
00:22:07,608 --> 00:22:10,108
If I ever thought I wanted
to get rid of a living,

476
00:22:10,192 --> 00:22:13,650
breathing person,
and not just a spirit...

477
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:19,025
Would anybody be there...

478
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:20,900
...to stop me?

479
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:23,567
[NARRATOR]
Mob sat there and tried to think

480
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,775
about everything
that had happened

481
00:22:24,858 --> 00:22:26,567
over the past two days...

482
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,233
But he may have
been too tired,

483
00:22:28,317 --> 00:22:30,692
because he quickly
went to sleep.

484
00:24:04,692 --> 00:24:06,817
[REIGEN] We were invited over
to a rich guy's mansion!

485
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,942
Oh, man, I smell a big job!

486
00:24:09,025 --> 00:24:11,150
Let's make some money, Mob!

487
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:13,942
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho</i>
<i>100 II</i> , episode four:

488
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:15,567
"Inside: Evil Spirit."

489
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,400
A video streaming service?
Obviously an excellent decision!
