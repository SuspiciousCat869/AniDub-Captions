[groans]

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,900
It's so slow lately
and I'm bored.

3
00:00:13,983 --> 00:00:15,150
Well, that just
means there aren't

4
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:17,358
any spirits out there
bothering people, right?

5
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:19,317
[REIGEN]
It is peaceful...

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,233
[MOB]
It sure is.

7
00:00:21,317 --> 00:00:23,400
But at this rate, we'll starve!

8
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:24,692
[REIGEN]
So we're gonna have to drum up

9
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,483
some work on our own.

10
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:05,108
[MOB]
Urban legends?

11
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,358
[REIGEN]
Yeah.

12
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:07,692
I'm sure you've talked
about stuff like that

13
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:09,900
with your friends at least
once or twice, right?

14
00:02:09,983 --> 00:02:11,108
[MOB]
Not really.

15
00:02:11,192 --> 00:02:12,358
Seriously?

16
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:13,525
'Cause when I was a kid,

17
00:02:13,608 --> 00:02:16,442
those sorts of things
were all the rage.

18
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:18,900
Hanako of the Toilet,
the Human-Faced Dog.

19
00:02:18,983 --> 00:02:22,025
Or the Dragger, if you want
somethin' a little newer.

20
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,692
My plan is to scour
the internet for local hits

21
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:26,983
about anything having
to do with urban legends.

22
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:29,858
That sounds even harder
than catching a <i>tsuchinoko</i> .

23
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,108
Nah, not really.

24
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,567
The Dragger's just a
story someone made up.

25
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,067
It's not like that
girl actually exists.

26
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,775
Then why look into it?

27
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:38,942
[REIGEN]
Places where urban legends

28
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,858
are popular tend to
have a lot of people

29
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:43,067
who believe in them
living in that area.

30
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,067
Which means tons of people there

31
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,567
will be looking
to buy an exorcism.

32
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,067
Why do you look happy
talking about sad people?

33
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,150
The secret to door-to-door
sales is a confident smile!

34
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:58,442
That desk's kinda short.

35
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:00,025
It was cheap.

36
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:02,483
What's with all the cold stares?

37
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:04,900
[MOB] Are we blocking
the street or something?

38
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:06,650
[BANSHOMARU]
Hey, you there!

39
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:09,608
Who gave you permission
to do business here?

40
00:03:09,692 --> 00:03:10,650
Don't you know this area

41
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:13,067
belongs to me,
Banshomaru Shinra,

42
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,858
the greatest psychic
of the century?

43
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:18,150
[MOB] He's the greatest
of the century, too...?

44
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:19,775
What do you mean, "belongs"?

45
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:23,025
You're obviously not with
the Rising Sun Spiritual Union.

46
00:03:23,108 --> 00:03:24,650
No, I'm a free agent.

47
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:26,525
Name's Reigen Arataka.

48
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:30,108
If you're another con ar--
I mean, uh, businessman,

49
00:03:30,192 --> 00:03:32,150
do you think you could
hook me up with a few jobs?

50
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:33,983
The work's been
really slow lately.

51
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:36,025
Hmph! It would be
pretty stupid of me

52
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:38,275
to help out a business
rival, wouldn't it?

53
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:39,817
Now go on, and get outta here!

54
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,025
Not a chance.

55
00:03:41,108 --> 00:03:42,900
What right do you have
to order me around?

56
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:44,858
[BANSHOMARU] You are breaking
so many city codes.

Oh, that's rich comin'
from somebody like you!

58
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:50,650
And what's that supposed
to mean exactly?!

[CUSTOMER 02A]
Excuse me...

Sorry to bother you,

00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:56,400
[BOTH]
Yes, ma'am!

62
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:57,608
[CUSTOMER 02A]
I'm so glad.

63
00:03:57,692 --> 00:03:59,192
I was hoping you could help me.

64
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:01,192
[BOTH]
With pleasure! Sure!

65
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:04,358
[BANSHOMARU] So, what
seems to be the trouble?

66
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:07,233
Since childhood, it seems
I've always attracted spirits.

67
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:09,150
Ghosts and other
supernatural phenomena

68
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:10,817
are drawn to me like a magnet.

69
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,525
There's one here now.

70
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:14,233
Right next to me.

71
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:15,358
What? There's nothi--

72
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:16,858
Ah, yes. I can see it.

73
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:18,733
Hey, you shouldn't
lie to the client.

74
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:20,192
What did you just say to me?

75
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:21,775
Ugh, get a load of this guy.

76
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:23,525
There is nothing worse
than having to work

77
00:04:23,608 --> 00:04:25,608
alongside frauds and liars.

78
00:04:25,692 --> 00:04:26,733
Am I right, Mob?

79
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:29,192
I see the spirit of
a middle-aged man.

80
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:30,692
Oh, that side! Of course.

81
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:31,817
Thank goodness.

82
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,525
You are legit psychics.

83
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,025
Last time, I searched for help

84
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,858
on the internet. But all I
found were a bunch of phonies.

85
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:39,900
Hey, what is it
you're writing down?

86
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:42,233
I've never even thought
about making a website.

87
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:43,733
I gotta up my online game.

88
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,483
[CUSTOMER 02A] Lately,
there's been an especially

89
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:48,067
foul energy building
up around me.

90
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,317
I've managed to ward off
its effects with salt,

91
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,317
piling it on plates in my room.

92
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,817
Ah. Yes.

93
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,567
Spiritual texts do refer to
the efficacy of salt plates.

94
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,858
That's right.

95
00:04:57,942 --> 00:04:59,983
That's why I ordered
extra salt on these fries.

96
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,650
To deter spirit intrusion.

97
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:02,775
Hey, Mob.

98
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:04,150
Don't eat too many of those.

99
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:05,400
[MOB]
Huh?

100
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:06,692
[CUSTOMER 02A]
I think there's been an increase

101
00:05:06,775 --> 00:05:09,067
in my own sense of
dread lately due to

102
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,150
the urban legends
connected with this town

103
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:13,275
that keep spreading.

104
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:14,858
[CUSTOMER 02A]
The human-faced dog.

105
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:17,525
Dash Granny. The Red Raincoat.

106
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,275
And the Dragger.

107
00:05:19,358 --> 00:05:21,192
I beg of you, please get rid

108
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:22,775
of the urban legends
plaguing us.

109
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:27,192
Uh, well, I'm sorry, but I
can't just go around and--

110
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:29,942
Leave it all to me,
Reigen Arataka!

111
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:32,150
I swear I'll take care of them!

112
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,525
[gasps]

113
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:36,108
So, which course would
you like to go with?

114
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:37,358
Which course?

115
00:05:37,442 --> 00:05:40,192
We have a special right
now on weekend rates.

116
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:41,400
[BANSHOMARU]
You surprised me.

117
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:43,483
Can't believe you took the job.

118
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,900
And you want 20,000 yen
if you succeed?

119
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:48,025
It does get that
expensive, right?

120
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:51,025
Our base package
starts at 200,000 yen.

121
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:52,233
So I figure the final bill

122
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:53,900
for this would run
well over 500,000--

123
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:56,650
Well, I really appreciate
you helping me on this one.

124
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:59,567
[BANSHOMARU]
Huh? Wait, what did he just say?

00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,400
[REIGEN] Come on,
let's get movin' on this.

00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:02,775
Time's a wastin'!

127

Mister... Bashinmarsha?

00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:06,775
Banshomaru Shinra!

129
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:08,442
And I'm not helping you, jerk!

130
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:09,983
You sat with her
and heard her out.

131
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:10,942
No running away.

132
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:12,275
[BANSHOMARU]
Oh, no, I refuse!

133
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:14,525
I'll cut you in on
the pay, of course.

134
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,192
I say we split up and
start questioning people.

135
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:18,358
Here's my info.

136
00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:20,233
Be sure to stay in touch
with any updates.

137
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:21,067
[BANSHOMARU]
Hmph.

138
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,275
Whatever, fine.

139
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:25,150
I guess I'll chalk
this one up as charity.

140
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:27,608
Great! Thanks a bunch!

141
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:29,275
[REIGEN]
He wasn't busy, anyway.

142
00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:31,150
Hey, Mob. Is Dimple around?

143
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:33,900
Dimple, he's calling you.

144
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,317
What now?!

145
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,525
I stay in extra-invisible
mode just to avoid you.

146
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:40,067
Ah, come on, don't be like that.

147
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,483
We're co-workers now, aren't we?

148
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,983
Like hell we are!

149
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:44,525
You just boss me around
like I'm some--!

150
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:46,817
Keep a close eye on the
fatso we're working with.

151
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,858
Use your stealth mode.

152
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:49,358
Well what's the point in that?

153
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,733
If he skips out on
the job, who cares?

154
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:52,858
[REIGEN]
Think he's the kinda idiot

155
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:54,775
who never deviates
from the manual.

156
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:56,733
But on this job, if anything bad

157
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:59,858
should happen to him,
as team leader, it'd be on me.

158
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:01,275
Come on, Dimple, please?

159
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:03,442

Yeah. Our client
was absolutely right.

There's something
wrong with this town.

There may really be something
sinister at work here.

[MOB] Why are we at
an internet café?

168
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:30,317
Because if we went around
questioning little kids,

169

somebody might call the cops.

Yeah, he was here a minute ago.

He tried to talk to us
but we both ran off.

00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,942
Here goes!

316
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,733
Hey. Tell me, are you thirsty?!

317
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:23,233
Are you flirting?

318
00:14:23,317 --> 00:14:26,317
'Cause I'm not a fan of
women who are too pushy!

319
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:33,817
Take this!

320
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:39,442
[groans]

[yelping]

322
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:48,608
Whether or not I buy
into this manual,

323
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:50,692
it sure did come in handy!

324
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,692
[DIMPLE yells]

325
00:14:57,942 --> 00:14:59,358
[DIMPLE]
Gotta keep him alive!

326
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:01,608
So we're getting out of here!

327
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:04,525
This is an SOS!

328
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:07,692
[REIGEN]
There we go! All clean!

329
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,817
Oh, man. Mob, if I
didn't know any better,

330
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,400
I'd say you just
jumped in a pool.

331
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:13,192
Guess I shouldn't have helped.

332
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:14,275
[phone ringing]

333
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:15,900
[REIGEN]
Hello, Reigen here.

334
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:18,067
Ah, got any info on--

335
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:21,775
Let's go.

336
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:24,150
Looks like he ran
into the Dragger.

337
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:34,733
She's one of the most popular
urban legends of modern times.

338
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:37,692
Maybe that's because of all the
talk about her on social media.

339
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:40,733
Either way, she's way
more powerful than most.

340
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:52,525
Looks like she can shapeshift
to suit her needs, too.

341
00:15:52,608 --> 00:15:53,358
[gasps]

342
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:54,442
[yells]

343
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:04,817
[OHIKI screams]

344
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:20,442
He snapped his Achilles tendon!

345
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:23,025
This fatso needs to hit the gym!

346
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:33,733
Please, Dimple. Come on.

347
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:36,233
If this guy should
die under my watch,

348
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:38,567
Shigeo's not gonna
trust me anymore.

349
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,858
And I can't let that happen!

350
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:44,650
One day, that boy's
gonna be a big star.

351
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:48,525
So I'm gonna do whatever I
can to never let him down.

352
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,650
Oh, crap.

353
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:52,567
[OHIKI screams]

354
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,775
[MOB]
Thanks. Good work, Dimple.

355
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:06,358
[REIGEN]
Ooh! So that's the Dragger, huh?

356
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,733
Amazing!

357
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:09,942
Gotta take a quick
photo as proof.

358
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:12,900
Huh? She doesn't show
up on the screen.

359
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:13,733
[MOB gasps]

360
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:15,358
She's gone!

361
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:18,483
[DIMPLE] That monster you just
saw was created by rumors.

362
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:20,108
Which makes it hard
to categorize her

363
00:17:20,192 --> 00:17:21,608
as "real" or "fake."

364
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,192
What do ya mean?

365
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,775
[DIMPLE]
She manifested in this world

366
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:26,233
by feeding off the imagination

367
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:29,233
and curiosity of
countless people.

368
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:33,067
Her appearance, her strength--
it was all decided by humanity!

369
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,025
[REIGEN] So mankind's image
of her became real?

370
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:37,733
[BANSHOMARU]
Yes, that's right.

371
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:40,733
We know who the Dragger is,
so we can't exorcise her.

372
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:42,192
What? And why not?

373
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:44,108
You were once a kid
who was terrified of things

374
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:47,067
that went bump in
the night, weren't you?

375
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,817
Yeah, I guess we all were.

376
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,858
The Dragger appears
in the evening,

377
00:17:51,942 --> 00:17:53,442
when you're going
home from school.

378
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:56,608
She kidnaps kids and drags
them into the swamp.

379
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:58,192
I never believed in Santa Claus,

380
00:17:58,275 --> 00:18:01,525
but if I found myself alone on
a street corner in the rain...

381
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:03,400
...I got goosebumps.

382
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,525
[BANSHOMARU]
The terror we felt back then

383
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:08,608
is still burned into our brains.

384
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:11,692
Even now, I'm shaking
just thinking about it.

385
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:13,525
[REIGEN] So this cold
sweat I have right now

386
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:16,025
is because I'm
instinctively afraid of her?

387
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:17,733
For a symbol of fear like that,

388
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:19,233
the power of someone
who's afraid

389
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:21,108
serves as nothing but food.

390
00:18:21,192 --> 00:18:23,775
My spiritual power
didn't work on her.

391
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,942
She absorbs the energy of
those who are frightened,

392
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:28,233
getting stronger and stronger.

393
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:30,442
Attacks will just
make things worse.

394
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:32,942
Then I guess all
we can do is run.

395
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:34,942
We're done, Mob.
It's time to go.

396
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:36,525
Uh! Whoa! What the hell?!

397
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:38,150
[BANSHOMARU]
I-I can't get out!

398
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,900
[DIMPLE] It's the Dragger!
This is her doing.

399
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,358
[roars]

400
00:18:44,442 --> 00:18:46,692

She's gigantic!

00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:49,192
[REIGEN, BANSHOMARU yelling]

402
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:54,733
Careful, Mob!

403
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:57,650
She's probably gonna try
to absorb your power, too!

404
00:18:57,733 --> 00:19:00,150
No, take a closer look at her.

405
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:02,025
He's doing it!

406
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,233
[gasps]

407
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:05,692
[DIMPLE]
Ah, that's right!

408
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:07,358
Shigeo is different!

409
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:09,192
He was never a part
of those groups

410
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:12,983
that shared urban legends,
creepy gossip, or ghost stories!

411
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:16,275
He was isolated from
those childhood fears!

412
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:17,775
So he doesn't even know

413
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:20,733
what's supposed to be scary
about the Dragger!

414
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:23,733
[OHIKI screams]

415
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:31,358
[MOB] She's a rainy-day
monster, right?

416
00:19:31,442 --> 00:19:33,442
I mean, that's sorta
scary, isn't it?

417
00:19:33,525 --> 00:19:34,692
You don't get it at all!

418
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:36,692
The Dragger's got the
grip of a giant bear!

419
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,483
Once she digs her claws into
you, you can never escape!

420
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:41,692
She can swim across
a lake in 20 seconds!

421
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:44,442
I see! That's her
character profile, huh?

422
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:45,983
You're thinking about
her like someone

423
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:48,692
on a tv show or a
D&D game, aren't you?

424
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:50,108
Come on, Mob!

425
00:19:50,192 --> 00:19:52,150
You could at least pretend
to be scared or surprised.

426
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,400
This is why nobody
wants to talk to you.

427
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:55,817
Hold on. I thought you said

428
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,108
I didn't need to be
like other people.

429
00:19:58,192 --> 00:19:59,400
[REIGEN]
Yeah, but when you grow up,

430
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:02,233
being able to socialize
becomes more important.

431
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,567
[BANSHOMARU] I guess I got
hurt when I passed out there,

432
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,900
didn't I?

433
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:10,983
But thanks. This was a
valuable experience for me.

434
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:12,525
Now I'm gonna head down
to the police station

435
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:14,233
to talk about that flasher.

436
00:20:14,317 --> 00:20:15,692
Suppose this is goodbye.

00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:16,983
[BANSHOMARU groans]

00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:19,317
See ya. You take care, now.

439
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:22,192
One last thing
before we go home.

440
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:24,900
Let's go look into that
Dash Grannie, okay?

441
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,400
[REIGEN]
We're here at the perfect time.

442
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:39,817
Keep your eyes peeled
and stay focused.

00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,400
[DASHING GRANNIE panting]

446

[REIGEN]
There she is! It's really her!

447
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:50,858
Go for it, Mob!

448
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:56,650
What the--?!

449
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,317
One more time...

450
00:21:00,483 --> 00:21:01,233
Huh?

451
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:02,150
Hey, Shigeo, what's wrong?!

452
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:04,025
Yeah, hurry! Now!

453
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:06,775
[MOB] I can't exorcise
her. What do I do?

454
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:09,733
She's a lot more powerful
than the Dragger ever was.

455
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:10,858
We're doomed.

456
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:12,775
[BOTH]
You're kidding me!

457
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:14,733
[REIGEN] Oh crap, oh crap,
oh crap, crap, crap, crap!

458
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:15,983
What do we do?

459
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,692
The only thing we can do!
Run for it! Move!

460
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:21,275
[DIMPLE]
What happens if she catches us?

461
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:23,317
It's said that she grabs
her victims from behind

462
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,150
and strangles them to death!

463
00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:29,942
Don't stop running! If she
catches you, you're dead!

464
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:32,150
You're falling behind, Mob!

465

--[REIGEN chuckles]
--[DIMPLE sighs]

466
00:21:47,692 --> 00:21:50,400
[REIGEN] So. It was just an
old woman going for a run.

467
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:51,608
Hey, what happened?

468
00:21:51,692 --> 00:21:53,025
I thought you could
use your physic powers

469
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:55,400
to move really fast, Shigeo!

470
00:21:55,483 --> 00:21:57,692
What are you crying about?

471
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:01,317
I run all the time with the
Body Improvement Club...

472
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,900
...and I lost to an old woman.

473
00:22:05,942 --> 00:22:08,358
Hey, come on! This
isn't a competition!

474
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:11,317
Well, I did get a
photo for our client.

475
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,983
I'd say we're done here.

476
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,692

And with that, Dash Grannie

477
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:19,775
became the first urban legend
that traumatized poor Mob.

478
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,858
[REIGEN]
Boom! Did it!

479
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,233
Take a look, Mob!

480
00:22:24,317 --> 00:22:26,650
This update will get
us more jobs, for sure!

481
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,483
[DIMPLE]
Hmm?

482
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:30,400
What is this crap?

483
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:32,483
Looks like GeoCities.

484
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:06,275
[REIGEN]
Wow! My fantastic new homepage

485
00:24:06,358 --> 00:24:07,942
is getting us so many jobs now!

486
00:24:08,025 --> 00:24:08,817
Bring it on!

487
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,400
But something's wrong with Mob!

488
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:11,817
Hey, what's the matter?

489
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,192
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho</i>
<i>100 II</i> , episode three:

490
00:24:14,275 --> 00:24:16,067
"One Danger After Another:
Degeneration."

491
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,442
Recording it? Also an
excellent decision.
