1
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:12,192
[REIGEN] Man, I climbed
the ladder enough

2
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:13,942
to be on television.

3
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:15,150
These greenrooms are nice,

4
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:18,025
but they definitely
make you feel antsy.

5
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:20,108
Okay, Reigen. You're up.

6
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:25,608
All right. It's showtime.

7
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:01,233
[BANSHOMARU]
Ah, here we go.

8
00:02:01,317 --> 00:02:03,858
Master Jodo's return
to television.

9
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:07,525
[BANSHOMARU]
What?! Reigen?!

10
00:02:07,608 --> 00:02:10,275
What's he doing there?

11
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:12,442
And now, we find
out if our guests

12
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:14,525
can save the poor,
unfortunate young man

13
00:02:14,608 --> 00:02:15,900
who's been possessed!

14
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:17,525
Before that, I should introduce

15
00:02:17,608 --> 00:02:20,150
our assembled connections
to the spirit world.

16
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:21,858
Though he needs no introduction,

17
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,275
president of the
Rising Sun Spiritual Union,

18
00:02:24,358 --> 00:02:26,650
Master Kirin Jodo!

19
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:28,442
He's solved even
the most devastating

20
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:31,775
supernatural problems
and is the best of the best!

21
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:32,858
Our other guest is making

22
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:34,983
his first appearance
on television,

23
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:37,608
Mr. Reigen Arataka!

24
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:40,942
[clears throat] Hey.
Hello out there, everyone.

25
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:42,317
Reigen Arataka.

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,775
My business is
in Seasoning City.

27
00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:46,358
So tell us, what would you say

28
00:02:46,442 --> 00:02:49,067
are some of your most notable
accomplishments as a psychic?

29
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,150
[REIGEN]
Hm.

30
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:52,275
It's hard to pick
just one of them.

31
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:54,858
Well, I did defeat the
Dragger, so there's that.

32
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,775
What? That's awesome!

33
00:02:56,858 --> 00:02:57,900
Then we should expect to see

34
00:02:57,983 --> 00:02:59,942
some great things
from you today!

35
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:02,150
Now, let's bring out
the young man.

36
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:03,317
As we foresee things

37
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,108
of an unpredictable
nature taking place,

38
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:07,900
we have him securely
bound with restraints.

39
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:13,983
[babbling]

40
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:15,942
[AUDIENCE gasps]

41
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:17,900
[EBIHARA]
So, what do ya think?

42
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:19,275
Uh-huh...

43
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:20,900
I believe the footage
we just watched

44
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:22,858
moments ago mentioned
that he was possessed

45
00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:25,775
by a fox after playing
the Kokkuri game.

46
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:28,150
Specifically, it's the
ghost of a Ruppell's fox,

47
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:29,817
usually found in North Africa.

48
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,150
[EBIHARA]
That's amazing!

49
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:33,817
You deduced precisely
what kind of ghost it is!

50
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,150
Have anything to add,
Master Jodo?

51
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:38,817
The poor child.
Strapped down like that...

52
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,483
I hope we don't have to keep
him bound much longer.

53
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:42,775
[EBIHARA]
I feel the same way.

54
00:03:42,858 --> 00:03:45,358
I'm sure everyone watching
at home does, too.

55
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:46,650
And now, as promised,

56
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:49,608
we're going to witness
the public exorcism!

57
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:52,150
Right after an important
word from our sponsors.

58
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:56,900
When we're back,
we'll have Master Jodo

59
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:58,525
perform the exorcism.

60
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:02,650
Wait. Why don't we allow Reigen
to make the attempt, instead?

61
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:03,983
Wha--?!

62
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:06,275
[JODO] No one wants to see
an old man doing this.

63
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:07,483
Rather than show the world

64
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:09,525
the same-old-same-old,
why not let the country

65
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:12,358
see what a next-generation
psychic can do?

66
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:13,650
Whoa, wait a second!

67
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,192
I thought I was only
supposed to sit here

68
00:04:15,275 --> 00:04:16,567
and comment today!

69
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,733
I was just trying to
give you an opportunity

70
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:20,483
to be in the spotlight.

71
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:22,775
But, if you're not
up to the task...

72
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,858
I'll do it, as scripted.

73
00:04:24,942 --> 00:04:26,067
[REIGEN]
"Scripted"?

74
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,900
[REIGEN gasps]
I get it!

75
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:29,317
Hold up!

76
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,150
I'm happy to do it.

77
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:34,108
Sure, that's fine.

78
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:36,400
Reigen's gonna perform
the exorcism, guys!

79
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:39,150
--[JODO cackles]
--[AD] We're back in five!

80
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:43,192
[EBIHARA] We're back,
everyone, and now it's time

81
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:45,650
for the public exorcism!

82
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:47,608
The one performing
this feat is an exciting

83
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:49,775
newcomer who's had
a meteoric rise

84
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:51,233
in the psychic world!

85
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:52,942
Master Reigen Arataka!

86
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,983
Are you ready to do this?

87
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:56,317
Leave it all to me!

88
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,358
That's right!
Reigen Arataka is on it!

89
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:00,525
Mark my words,

90
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:02,858
this fox spirit's
as good as gone!

91
00:05:04,108 --> 00:05:07,692
[REIGEN] Live or not, this
is still a television show.

92
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,317
Everything that
happens is a setup

93
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,483
written by some scriptwriter.

94
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,817
If I make this look
like the real deal,

95
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,775
that'll be the cue for
the boy to calm down

96
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,233
and the studio
audience to applaud.

97
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:19,567
The host will praise me,

98
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,983
and then the show will be over.

99
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:29,192
[yells]

100
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:32,067
[REIGEN]
Salt Splash!

101
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,525
Whoa!

102
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:35,858
He started throwin' a ton
of salt all over the place!

103
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:37,233
The spirit possessing
the boy seems

104
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:38,983
to be struggling in agony!

105
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:41,775
It's working!
It's really working!

106
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:43,442
[REIGEN]
But it's never worked before!

107
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:45,858
Not even once!
Just as I thought!

108
00:05:45,942 --> 00:05:47,275
This kid's an actor!

109
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:48,733
Now that I know that for sure,

110
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:52,483
I'm not pullin' any
punches! Here we go!

111
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:55,692
[REIGEN]
Sorcery Crush Special!

112
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:58,233
Air Banishing Salt...

113
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,983
Punch!

114
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:02,983
It's a clean hit!

115
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,233
Well, I'd say it's been
about 30 minutes now

116
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:07,567
since Reigen started
the exorcism...

117
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,692
...but apparently, the spirit
just refuses to leave.

118
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:12,567
Talk about resilient.

119
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,942
[REIGEN]
Holy Water Chop!

120
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,442
[REIGEN]
Take a hint, kid!

121
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:17,233
I've already used
all my special moves.

122
00:06:17,317 --> 00:06:20,358
Now I'm trying to keep things
going by makin' stuff up!

123
00:06:20,442 --> 00:06:22,900
All right, why don't we have
our other psychic step in?

124
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,150
Huh?

125
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:26,525
[EBIHARA] Master Jodo,
if you wouldn't mind.

126
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:31,650
[REIGEN] Wait a second.
Was I just an opening act?

127
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:34,192
Is the old man gonna
take all the glory?!

128
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:36,858
Whoa, time out!
I've almost got it.

129
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:38,733
Switching right now might
be detrimental to the--

130
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:40,983
We're live. We gotta
move this along.

131
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:45,275
You've done some great work
over the last 30 minutes.

132
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:47,858
[REIGEN growls]
You schemin' old geezer!

133
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:49,608
All right then, Master Jodo!

134
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:51,358
Let's see you work!

135
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:54,275
[REIGEN]
My spotlight!

136
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:56,233
What am I supposed
to exorcise here?

137
00:06:56,317 --> 00:06:58,192
This boy isn't even possessed.

138
00:06:58,275 --> 00:06:59,358
He's just acting.

139
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:01,067
[REIGEN]
Huh?!

140
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:05,108
[REIGEN] Oh, come on!
Get a clue already!

141
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:08,192
Why'd you ruin all that setup
the program gave you?!

142
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:10,358
[EBIHARA]
That's absolutely correct!

143
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:12,067
I'm impressed you were
able to see the truth

144
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,567
when everyone in the studio has
been fooled this entire time!

145
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,483
You witnessed it all happen
here, ladies and gentleman!

146
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:22,858
A true psychic has
just been revealed!

147
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:25,942
My name's Suzuo Fukuda

148
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:28,233
and I'm with the
Mongolian Spot Agency!

149
00:07:28,317 --> 00:07:30,525
Wow, that was some
brilliant acting!

150
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:32,317
Thank you very much, sir!

151
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,192
You totally had me
fooled! Good job!

152
00:07:35,275 --> 00:07:36,900
[EBIHARA]
Mogi, you haven't chimed in yet.

153
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:38,275
What do ya think?

154
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:39,608
What do I think?

155
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,608
I guess I really only have
one question for him.

156
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:44,567
What was that "exorcism"
crap all about?

157
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,400
What exactly were
you doing to a spirit

158
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:47,983
that didn't even exist?

159
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,775
Have any response to that?

160
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:52,358

you'd hold a press conference!

315
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:30,233
That's 'cause you guys
stalked me everywhere I went.

316
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:33,483
You basically forced me
into having this thing.

317
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,025
I have a few
questions regarding

318
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,108
some of the fraudulent
acts you've committed.

319

Hang on a second.

320
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:41,150
By "fraudulent acts,"
do you mean my business?

321
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:42,942
Is there anyone here
who can prove

322
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:44,150
beyond a shadow of a doubt

323
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,400
that I don't have
any spiritual powers?

324
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:47,983
Or maybe any victims
who can prove

325
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:49,442
they've been swindled?

326
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:50,900
There are many people
who've reported

327
00:14:50,983 --> 00:14:52,108
that you scammed them.

328
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,983
Right, self-proclaimed
"victims".

What do you mean by
"self-proclaimed," huh?!

00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:58,983
[REIGEN] I mean none
of that has been proven.

Unless and until they do,

332
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,483
I can still call
myself a psychic.

333
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:03,983
I'm not a criminal.

334
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:07,358
You should be more careful
with how you phrase things.

335
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:08,942
I have a question, then.

00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:10,358
Go ahead.

I have no comment on that.

Why won't you
answer the question?

340
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:19,442
[REIGEN] Because you won't be
satisfied unless I say "no."

341
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:21,442
And I can't prove
I have spiritual powers

342
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:23,275
since you all lack
them yourselves.

and talk your way
out of this mess?

345

Judging by what you did on
the broadcast the other day,

you do seem like an
excellent ad-libber.

psychic business of yours?

355
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,483
About four years ago.

[REPORTER 07N] And what were
you doing prior to that?

357
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:53,317
I held a job at some company.

358
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
[REPORTER 07N]
Did that company have anything

What's wrong with him?

393
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:04,942
[REIGEN] Why did I decide
to live my life as a psychic?

394
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,192
It's not like there's
a lot of money in it.

395
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:09,358
And it's usually a pain.

00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:10,692
Thinking back on it,

397
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:12,608
there was once a time I
did everything efficiently

398
00:17:12,692 --> 00:17:16,442
and was filled with
curiosity about everything.

399
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:18,358
But then I got bored,
quit my job,

400
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:21,442
and rented that
office on a whim.

401
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:23,525
I ended up getting into
this facade of a job

402
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:26,858
'cause of an ad I
saw in a magazine.

That's right.

472
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:06,858
[REIGEN] Back then,
I couldn't help but admire

473
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:09,483
this little kid that
walked into my life.

474
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:12,317
But I wanted something
for myself, too.

475
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,692
I wanted to become
someone special.

476
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:18,567
Yet this is the result.

477
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,275
I haven't changed
at all since that day.

478
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:23,192
I just kept using him.

479
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:24,733
Over and over.

480
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:28,608
In the end, I couldn't
become anything.

481
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:31,192
And by using Mob,
all I really did

482
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:34,192
was hold him back from
enjoying being a kid.

483
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,150
Man, I said some really
terrible things to him.

484
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:39,858
He wanted to change
and be more social.

485
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:42,192
And I just tried to cage him in.

486
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:48,483
[REIGEN]
Hey... Mob...

487
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,025
Are you watching?

488
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:03,317
You've grown up
so much. You know?

489
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,858
[REPORTER 07R]
That doesn't answer anything!

490
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:07,233
[REPORTER 07S]
You're wasting our time!

491
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:08,317
[REPORTER 07T] What was all
that silence all about?

492
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,525
[REPORTER 07L]
Who was that message to?

493
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:10,692
[REPORTER 07U]
We don't understand!

494
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:11,983
[REPORTER 07V]
Answer us!

495
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,650
[REPORTER 07L]
It's an earthquake!

496
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,108
[REPORTER 07W]
We're experiencing an extremely

497
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:19,817
powerful earthquake!

498
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:23,025
Where're they holding
this thing, anyway?

499
00:21:23,108 --> 00:21:25,192
[REPORTER 07X yelps]

500
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:26,817
[REPORTER 07Y]
Our cameras!

501
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,192
I-Impossible. Is
Reigen doing this?!

502
00:21:30,275 --> 00:21:31,483
Telekinesis?!

503
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:33,150
Whoa! What power!

504
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:35,567
There's something you
don't see every day.

505
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,358
Holy crap. This is
getting serious.

506
00:21:38,442 --> 00:21:40,650
Brother! Hey, brother!

507
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:41,650
[REPORTER 07Z]
What's with you?!

508
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,358
How can you stay
so calm up there?!

509
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:45,650
[REPORTER 07W] Are you
the one behind all this?!

510
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:47,650
Please! You have
to do something!

511
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:51,108
Are your spiritual
powers doing this?

512
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:54,483
Goodness. Wonder what's
goin' on around here.

513
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:56,233
[REPORTER 07L]
Stop this! I beg you!

514
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:57,942
[REPORTER 07W]
What the hell is this?!

515
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,650
[REIGEN] You done asking
me if I'm a fraud?

516
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:02,067
[REPORTER 07L screams]

517
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,900
In that case, I think
it's time to end

518
00:22:03,983 --> 00:22:05,192
this press conference.

519
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:06,442
[REPORTER 07AA]
Hey! Hold on!

520
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,108
[REPORTER 07BB]
What's going to happen to us?!

521
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:09,692
Dunno.

522
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:12,817
You should probably concentrate
on finding your next big story.

523
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:20,692
[REPORTER 07CC]
One of the lights fell!

524
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:25,108
What the hell just happened?

525
00:22:25,192 --> 00:22:27,233
Such bullcrap...

526
00:22:43,858 --> 00:22:47,567
[REIGEN]
So... Why'd you come here?

527
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,483
Just because.

528
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,650
[DIMPLE]
Let's get the hell outta here.

529
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:53,983
They'll be runnin'
around for a while.

530
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:57,442
[inhales]

531
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:01,192
[REIGEN]
Hey.

532
00:23:01,275 --> 00:23:02,858
Did you know?

533
00:23:02,942 --> 00:23:04,692
[MOB]
Know what?

534
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:06,692
[REIGEN]
What I really am.

535
00:23:06,775 --> 00:23:10,358
I mean, what they've
been saying in the news.

536
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:13,192
[MOB] I always have.
From the very beginning.

537
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:14,567
[REIGEN gasps]

538
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:20,150
I've known that my
master is genuinely...

539
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,567
...a good guy.

540
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,192
[REIGEN gasps]

541
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,692
[REIGEN]
I am starving.

542
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:50,400
Let's get some ramen
and head home.

543
00:23:50,483 --> 00:23:51,608
[MOB]
Sure.

544
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,317
[MOB]
Oh, by the way, Master.

545
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,067
I know I'm late but...
Happy Birthday.

546
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,692
[REIGEN]
Mob's finally telling Tsubomi

547
00:24:05,775 --> 00:24:07,192
how he really feels about her?

548
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:09,650
And he's trying to place
in the top ten of a marathon?

549
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:11,567
Well, looks like he's
gonna need my help.

550
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,067
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho</i>
<i>100 II</i> episode eight:

551
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,525
"Even Then ~Continue Forward~."

552
00:24:15,608 --> 00:24:18,275
First-press limited edition?
Absolute best decision.
