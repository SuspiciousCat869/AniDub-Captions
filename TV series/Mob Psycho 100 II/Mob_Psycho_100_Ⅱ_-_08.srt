1
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:15,358
Wait up. Wait up!

2
00:00:15,442 --> 00:00:18,525
Be careful, now! You'll
fall if you keep running!

3
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,067
Whoa, are you okay, brother?

4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,608
[MOM]
See? I tried to warn you.

5
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,900
Come on, let me take a look.

6
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:34,525
[sobs]

7
00:00:34,608 --> 00:00:35,442
Wow.

8
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:38,275
Oh, not this again. Shige, stop!

9
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:39,275
[laughs]

10
00:00:39,358 --> 00:00:40,858
Aw, well, what the heck?

11
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:29,108
[MEZATO]
Who'd've thought?

12
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:31,942
A whole building in
Mob's name. Way to go.

13
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:33,817
Though the Psycho Helmet
Religion still hasn't

14
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,275
found its leader, it now
has over 700 members.

15
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:38,775
Thanks to an anonymous donation,

16
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:40,650
they were able to
create a headquarters,

17
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:42,400
and its followers
work tirelessly

18
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:44,983
to recruit new people.

19
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:48,817
They have no form of scripture,
nor any idea what to do.

20
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,900
All they know is that
their beloved founder

21
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:54,025
is apparently a real esper
and in middle school.

22
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,983
The faith is also
gaining popularity

23
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:59,192
and spreading on the internet
as a "meme religion."

24
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:01,192
If Mob ever decides
to appear and make

25
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:05,192
his identity known, this
order will get even bigger!

26
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:06,733
I wanna see that happen!

27
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:07,858
Because...

28
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:10,108
Well, it just seems
like it'd be fun.

29
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,025
[KOGA] It's your favorite
time of year once again.

30
00:03:14,108 --> 00:03:18,150
That's right, you guessed
it: Annual Marathon time!

31
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:20,275
[STUDENT 08A]
Aw, man. Seriously?

32
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:21,858
Enough. No excuses.

33
00:03:21,942 --> 00:03:24,525
Don't even think about
faking an illness!

34
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,733
[MEZATO]
Hey, Mob...

35
00:03:30,817 --> 00:03:32,442
[MOB]
Mezato... What is it?

36
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:35,067
Well, there's something
I wanna talk to you about.

37
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,317
You think maybe
you could meet me

38
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,942
on the roof during lunch?

39
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:40,150
It's really important, okay?

40
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:42,900
I'll be waiting for you.

41
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:44,233
[DIMPLE]
Shigeo!

42
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:46,692
Maybe a young lady's going
to ask you out again!

43
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,275
But this time for real!

44
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:50,650
No, I'm pretty sure
she just wants to talk.

45
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:52,233
You can be so dramatic, Dimple.

46
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:53,442
I don't get it.

47
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,900
I liked you much
better when you were

48
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:56,650
bright-eyed and innocent.

49
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,942
It wasn't that long ago
you'd get beet-red

50
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:02,108
and flustered from
even talking to a girl.

51
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:06,358
[MEZATO]
Thanks for coming, Mob.

52
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:08,942
I wanted to talk to you
about the marathon.

53
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:10,442
Oh. Right.

54
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:12,400
Uh-huh, that makes
sense, I guess.

55
00:04:12,483 --> 00:04:15,275
[DIMPLE] Wait... Was he
actually expecting more?

56
00:04:15,358 --> 00:04:17,650
I had an idea about
what you should do.

57
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,483
Why not use your
powers to run faster

58
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:21,733
and then totally shock
everyone by winning?

59
00:04:21,817 --> 00:04:23,275
But, why?

60
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:25,400
[MEZATO] W-Well, believe it
or not, there's this "fan club"

61
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:26,983
that's been looking for you.

62
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,067
Fan club?

63
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,192
[MEZATO]
It's a religious group.

64
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:30,858
They call themselves
Psycho Helmet.

65
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:33,108
Oh, it's a religious group.

66
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:35,442
Those guys...

67
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,108
So during that press
conference the other day...

68
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:40,400
...apparently there was
a split-second shot

69
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:41,942
of you from behind.

70
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:43,733
They analyzed the
footage and found out

71
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:47,108
that your uniform was
from Salt Middle School.

72
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:48,483
The followers are positive that

73
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,483
the poltergeist
incident was real,

74
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:53,192
and it only deepened
their devotion.

75
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:55,650
Knowing them, they're
sure to observe the area

76
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:57,400
during the marathon.

77
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,442
When they do, you can
reveal your powers

78
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:01,983
and then prove you're the leader
they've been looking for!

79
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:03,733
Don't you wanna make
an important moment

80
00:05:03,817 --> 00:05:06,358
like that as epic as possible?

81
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:09,233
I'm sorry, but I think
that would be cheating.

82
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:11,150
Physical strength only.

83
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:13,192
I'm jogging now,
so maybe by next year

84
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:15,442
I'll be able to place
in the top ten.

85
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:16,817
Oh, wow...

86
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,067
You really thought about
this race that much?

87
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,400
Who knew you actually
had a goal in mind?

88
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:23,358
Ugh! It can't be next year!

89
00:05:23,442 --> 00:05:26,025
Then we'll be cramming for our
high school entrance exams!

90
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:27,525
Which means we won't
have time to deal

91
00:05:27,608 --> 00:05:28,900
with stuff like this anymore!

92
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:30,650
Right, I forgot.

93
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:31,567
That's not good.

94
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,650
What now?

95
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,108
I had a plan.

96
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:37,900
If I ran in next
year's marathon...

97
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:40,942
...and placed in the top ten,
I was gonna ask out Tsubomi.

98
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:42,317
What?! Are you serious?!

99
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,567
Wait, you mean Takane?!

100
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,358
I blew it during the
student council election,

101
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:51,358
but I was hoping to look cool
placing at next year's marathon.

102
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:52,650
[DIMPLE]
Shigeo...

103
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:54,317
How were you able
to change so much

104
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,483
right under my nose
without me noticing?

105
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,233
[MOB] If next year doesn't work,
it'll have to be this year.

106
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:01,983
I'll just have to
train as hard as I can

107
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,108
and place somewhere
in the top ten.

108
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,608
[INUKAWA laughs]

109
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:09,733
No way!

110
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:11,608
I never imagined I'd
hear you say that!

111
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:14,108
Do you even remember where
you finished last year?

112
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:16,108
I was 291st...

113
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:17,400
Right! Way too slow!

114
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:20,150
You finished in the
very bottom ten of 300!

115
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:21,900
How do you expect to
jump to the top end

116
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:23,650
in just ten days?

117
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,775
A 5K is a tough race no
matter how you look at it.

118
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:29,192
My older brother is
on the high school

119
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:30,733
track team and he's really good!

120
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:32,275
Should I ask him for some tips?

121
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,233
Last-minute advice
isn't going to suddenly

122
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:35,983
turn him into a speedster!

123
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,525
Maybe watch what you eat between

124
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:39,858
now and the race and
tone your body a bit.

125
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,692
We're not talking
about a diet here!

126
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:42,900
I know.

127
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:44,442
Why don't you buy some
fancy running shoes?

128

He's not made of money.

I'll just do my best.

[ONIGAWARA]
Damn straight, Kageyama!

That's why you're
our shadow leader!

132
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:55,025
These methods and
their efficiency

133
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:56,525
don't count for squat!

134
00:06:56,608 --> 00:06:59,608
What really matters is whether
or not you wanna do this!

135
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:02,775
For you, it's about having
the will to succeed.

However, Kageyama,
doing your best

and giving something your
all ain't exactly easy!

it takes to really

put everything on the line here?

Uh. Yes, I do.

141
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:17,233
Then take my running shoes.

142
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:19,317
What? But those shoes
are brand new!

give them to Mob?

Thanks, but why, Onigawara?

Heh. Just do this thing.

So you ended up
with them, Kageyama!

00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:35,817

Why did you have to ruin it?

[REIGEN] Why are you
so fidgety today, Mob?

00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:44,483
[MOB]
Oh, sorry.

155
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:46,150
I'm just trying to
get in some exercise

every chance I can.

Guess that's not
exactly "fidgeting."

158

[DIMPLE] The boy's got
a big marathon coming up.

I always faked being sick
to get out of running them.

161
00:07:57,775 --> 00:07:59,317
He hopes that placing
in the top ten

162
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,233
will give him the courage
to tell Tsubomi how he feels.

163
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:03,275
[REIGEN gasps]

164
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,442
Seriously?!

165
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:07,400
That's a big step.

166
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:11,442
[REIGEN]
Hm...

167
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:16,900
[REIGEN] You won't be needed
here for the next few days.

168
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:19,358
Huh? I won't? But why?

169
00:08:19,442 --> 00:08:20,983
[REIGEN] Looks like it's
gonna be a slow week

170
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,442
for new clients.

171
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:24,525
More importantly,
you should be jogging

172
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:26,317
to better prepare for this race.

173
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,608
All right, get changed.

174
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:28,817
Huh?

175
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,108
[REIGEN] We're gonna get
your legs accustomed

176
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:32,483
to the actual course
you'll be running.

177
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,275
[DIMPLE] Come on!
Lift those feet, Reigen!

178
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:37,525
Shut up!

179
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:41,108
I haven't been running
that much myself lately!

180
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:43,442
I can't hear you! Run!

181
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:46,983
[REIGEN] Hey, Mob.
You wanna stop for some tea?

182
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:51,733
We've only been going for
about ten minutes, Master.

183
00:08:51,817 --> 00:08:53,317
Huh? Brother?

184
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,525
Yo! How goes it, Ritsu?

185
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:58,650
[RITSU] Hey, Dimple. Is he
training for the marathon?

186
00:08:58,733 --> 00:08:59,525
Yeah.

187
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:01,025
He's gonna place in the top ten

188
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:03,525
to boost his courage
and ask out Tsubomi.

189
00:09:03,608 --> 00:09:04,733
[RITSU]
What?!

190
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:06,692
[RITSU]
Tsubomi Takane?

191
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:09,942
I remember playing with her
when we were all little kids.

192
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:13,150
But honestly, I found her
kinda hard to deal with.

193
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:14,817
I remember her going
home in the middle

194
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,108
of a game of hide-and-seek...

195
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:21,067
[inhales] Now I'm worried.

196
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,817
Just be careful with
all of this, brother.

197
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,358
[MOM] Shige! Wash your
own dishes, all right?

198
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,650
Shige!

199
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:31,233
[RITSU]
It's okay, Mom.

200
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:32,733
I'll take care of it.

201
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:34,108
You don't have to, Ritsu.

202
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:36,442
You shouldn't spoil your
older brother like that.

203
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:38,275
Is something goin' on?

204
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:41,233
He's just been workin'
really hard lately.

205
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:44,442
Knowing that, I don't mind
helping him out a little.

206
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,025
Thanks again for comin'
by today, you two.

207
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:07,775
I look forward to
working with ya.

208
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,525
I'm just doing this
for my brother.

209
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:11,900
I want him to be able to
concentrate on training.

210
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:14,817
That said, we're here
to sub in for Kageyama.

211
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,650
Whatever you need, we're on it.

212
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:17,775
I appreciate it.

213
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:19,150
Could you sort those files?

214
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:21,858
And also, take a look at any
exorcism request emails.

215
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:23,025
[door creaks]

216
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:25,108
Excuse me? Are you guys open?

217
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,358
I didn't make an
appointment, so--

218
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:28,608
[REIGEN]
Oh, you're in luck!

219
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:30,525
Uh, please, have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

220
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:33,025
All right. Now, would you mind
getting some tea ready?

221
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:34,858
And, uh...

222
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:36,858
Hey. Where'd he go?

223
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:38,650
He's hiding for some reason.

224
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:41,233
[RITSU]
Takane?! What is she doing here?

225
00:10:41,317 --> 00:10:43,567
I don't care about myself,
but I can't let her

226
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,400
find out that my brother
has anything to do

227
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:47,358
with a shady place like this!

228
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:49,775
Um, I heard that
you also specialize

229
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,108
in relationship advice...

230
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:52,733
Right?

231
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:54,150
[TSUBOMI]
Mm-hm.

232
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:55,733
Think you could do that for us?

233
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:57,567
[RITSU]
Relationship advice?!

234
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,733
[REIGEN]
Of course!

235
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:00,233
Just fill out this
questionnaire, please.

236
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:01,775
Yeah, sure.

237
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,400
[REIGEN]
I see... Mm-hm, mm-hm...

238
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:08,358
So you go to Salt Middle School.

239
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:09,483
What a coincidence!

240
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,567
I know someone at
Salt Middle School!

241
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,400
[RITSU] Dammit, Reigen!
You shut your mouth!

242
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:17,025
So tell us, what's
this person like, Miki?

243
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:18,858
[REIGEN clears throat]
I appreciate the help, kid,

244
00:11:18,942 --> 00:11:21,233
but I can handle it from here.

245
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:22,650
I see...

246
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,983
So the person of interest
is probably in your grade.

247
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:26,150
Maybe a bit older.

248
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,483
And they likely play
some kind of sport.

249
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:30,358
Oh, wow! You're right!

250
00:11:30,442 --> 00:11:31,317
[REIGEN]
Hm.

251
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,900
I see now...

252
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,567
He's on the soccer
team, so you wanna

253
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,108
get him some new cleats.

254
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:38,983
But if you get him
a really nice pair,

255
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:40,733
you're afraid that
the monetary value

256
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:43,692
may leave a bigger impression
than your feelings.

257
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:46,317
In that case, I think you
should start off as friends.

258
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,817
Ask him what his hobbies
are outside of soccer...

259
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:52,817
[REIGEN]
So basically...

260
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,442
...what I'm saying is
that there's no need

261
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:57,067
for you to rush into things
by asking him out, Miki.

262
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,775
Not in my opinion, at least.

263
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:00,567
Wow! Okay, thank you so much!

264
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,525
That's actually some
really helpful advice!

265
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:04,275
Um, I didn't fill out
the questionnaire,

266
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:05,525
but would you mind
if I asked you

267
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:06,983
some questions, too?

268
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:08,483
Sure, no problem!

269
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,692
Is this about a
relationship as well?

270
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:11,817
Yes.

271
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,400
The person I like
is actually someone

272
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,067
I met at cram school.

273
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,483
[REIGEN]
Ah, that's interesting...

274
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:18,483
[TSUBOMI]
We talk to each other...

275
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:20,233
Hey, what's up with you, man?

276
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:21,608
Sometimes, we even meet up

277
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:23,900
and walk home together
after cram school.

278
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:25,733
You think I should
ask this person out?

279
00:12:25,817 --> 00:12:27,233
[RITSU]
Gah!

280
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:29,275
[REIGEN] Hm... Well, considering
you two are already close,

281
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:32,192
I think it'd be fine to ask
them out as soon as you like.

282
00:12:32,275 --> 00:12:33,400
[RITSU]
Hey!

283
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:35,317
From what you've been
telling me just now,

284
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,233
the other person is obviously
interested in you, as well.

285
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:39,692
If you ask them out,
there's a high

286
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:42,150
probability they'll say yes.

287
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:43,233
[RITSU]
It's over...

288
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:44,858
[TSUBOMI]
Okay, then.

289
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:46,733
[MIKI, TSUBOMI]
Thank you very much.

290
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:48,942
Feel free to stop by anytime.

291
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:50,692
Do you know those
two or something?

292
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:52,692
'Cause they looked
a little older than you.

293
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:54,733
Well, uh...

294
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:57,442
[RITSU] I can't tell
Brother, I just can't.

295
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:58,775
[panting]

296
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:01,025
[RITSU]
I believe in you, Shige!

297
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,525
[MIKI] I didn't know you went
to cram school, Tsubomi.

298
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:06,358
You've never
mentioned it, before.

299
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:07,650
I don't.

300
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,692
The truth is, I just made
that whole story up.

301
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:11,483
I didn't want you to get
scammed or something,

302
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:14,150
so I thought I'd throw him
a curve ball and test him a bit.

303
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:15,358
You what?!

304
00:13:15,442 --> 00:13:17,067
That's crazy, but it
makes sense, I guess.

305
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,108
So what do you think?

306
00:13:18,192 --> 00:13:20,608
Did he pass your
little test or what?

307
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:21,650
[TSUBOMI]
Hm...

308
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:23,567
How should I put this...?

309
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,275
[TSUBOMI] He didn't say
anything wrong, exactly.

310
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:32,858
So, he's probably fine.

311
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,025
You can do it!

312
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:48,650
My parents came out for this.

313
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,650
Who do you think is the fastest?

314
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:53,150
[MEZATO]
This day has finally arrived.

315
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,067
It looks like there are
a few Psycho Helmet

316
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,858
followers waiting
near the finish line.

317
00:13:57,942 --> 00:14:00,317
It's time to present

[MEZATO]
Come on, Mob! You've got this!

319
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:05,650
Ritsu will be just fine,
but I'm worried about Shigeo.

320
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:08,067
Yeah, he's got the
stamina of a snail.

321
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,983
We should watch from
somewhere mid-course

322
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:12,150
rather than the finish line.

323

[KIJIBAYASHI coughs]

324
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:16,442
Oh, no. I think I've
caught a cold. Bummer.

[INUKAWA coughs]

00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,150
Oh, did you catch a cold,
too, Kijibayashi?

327
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:21,608
So did I!

328
00:14:21,692 --> 00:14:23,483
[KIJIBAYASHI] Wow, that's
such a coincidence, Inukawa.

[SARUTA coughs]

[KIJIBAYASHI]
You, too, Saruta?

331
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,400
Not bad for a first-year.

332
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:30,358
[SARUTA]
Oh, thank you, you're too kind.

333
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:32,608
The Telepathy Club's
really taught me a lot.

334
00:14:32,692 --> 00:14:34,817
[TOME] You're running,
you lazy bastards!

335
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,858
Even Mob's lined up
to do this thing!

336
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,067
So you three better
get going, too!

Hey, how ya doin', kid?

00:14:41,858 --> 00:14:43,192
Uh?

340
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:46,650
[DIMPLE] He's doomed.
The poor guy is super nervous.

Don't look so down, Kageyama!

[MOB]
President.

343
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:52,567
Show everybody what
all that training

344
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,608
has done for you.

I'll do my best!

00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:01,483
[ONIGAWARA] Heh. Looks like
he put those to good use.

349
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,233
Way to go, shadow leader.

350

We will now begin the boys' race

of the Salt Middle
School Marathon.

352

00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,275

[RITSU]
Brother!

356
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:56,733
That leg's gonna keep you from
catching up to the frontrunners.

357
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:58,608
Do ya want me to possess you?

358
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,525
You only need to make
the top ten, right, Mob?

359
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:05,567
Suit yourself.

360
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,233
My kid fell far behind
and he looked so annoyed.

361
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:12,733
[MOM 08B] There's no way
they'll catch up to the front.

362
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:15,358
Ritsu passed by a long time ago.

[MOM] Oh, no! What
happened to your leg?!

366
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,483
You've been building up
your stamina, right?

367
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:24,692
Hang in there!

368
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,275
Just keep it up! You're
doing great, Shigeo!

369
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:29,192
I feel so proud of him.

00:16:29,275 --> 00:16:30,442
Me, too.

371
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:31,942
I should make
something extra yummy

[TSUBOMI]
There's Mob.

374
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,733
You can do--

375
00:16:57,442 --> 00:16:58,775
[DIMPLE]
His form's all wrong.

376
00:16:58,858 --> 00:17:00,233
Did he sprain something?

377
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:02,358
His pace is getting
erratic, too.

378
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,775
Hey! You've only got
about a kilometer to go.

379
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:09,233
Move those legs!

380
00:17:09,317 --> 00:17:11,733
Hey, Reigen! Nice
outfit there, buddy!

381
00:17:11,817 --> 00:17:12,775
Shut it.

382
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:14,275
I thought I'd show up, step in,

383
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:17,108
and help him keep his pace
towards the end of the run...

384
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:20,317
...but the group of guys
up front are way too fast.

385
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,275
They're so far ahead.

386
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:25,150
I'm not sure you'd catch up
even if you sprinted.

387
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,317
I've been counting the runners.
He's currently in 74th place.

388
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,817
And I am really proud of him
for doing that well...

389
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,442
...but for him to finish
in the top ten,

390
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:36,650
he has to pass 64 others.

391
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:38,025
That's a problem.

did cross my mind, but...

there was a sudden explosion

it might've been arson.

off from work today

She's always extra careful
when she uses the stove.

467
00:21:08,942 --> 00:21:10,692
When I was younger,
she yelled at me

468

for messing around
with fireworks.

we can start over.

Shigeo!

00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:37,775
There were signs of a
struggle at the front door.

478
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:40,400
It looks like somebody
forced their way inside!

479
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:43,525
Then this was done on purpose?

480
00:21:43,608 --> 00:21:45,733
Wait! If somebody broke in...

481
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:47,483
...then that same person
could've kidnapped

482
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:49,400
them and taken them away!

483
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,483
Oh, no! I have to hurry
and look for clues!

Close your eyes, Shigeo!

487
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,358
Look away! Look away!

The boss, minions, all of them!

00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:10,358
It appears that I,

493
00:24:10,442 --> 00:24:12,317
must make a stand against
them once again!
