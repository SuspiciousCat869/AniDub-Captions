I was never one who believed

Forty years ago, to
be precise about it!

[DIMPLE] Keiji Mogami was
an incredibly popular psychic.

233
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:16,108
He used séances
and his channeling

abilities to help
people in need.

And the media couldn't
get enough of him!

But what the masses were seeing

was the celebrity,
the entertainer.

238
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,400
One day, almost out of nowhere,

239
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:29,442
he disappeared from
the public eye,

as if he just vanished.

241
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:34,942
But people didn't know
he had a darker side.

242
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:38,275
He was an assassin who
used his powers to kill.

00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:40,733
But he was desperate for money.

00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:42,442
His mother was gravely ill.

245
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:43,942
He wanted money
for her treatment

246
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:47,317
and the devices needed
to keep her alive.

[MOGAMI gasps]

480
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:26,067
This is unbelievable...

481
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:31,983
[coughs]

482
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:34,733
I've never met anyone
with the power you have.

483
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,483
You're truly blessed.

484
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:40,150
[MOB]
That's a spirit. An evil spirit.

485
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:42,400
I've got a question for you.

486
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:43,900
Do you happen to
know where every

487
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:47,150
single incarnation of
psychic power comes from?

488
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:49,650
I'm sorry, but I don't
have a lot of time.

489
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:50,983
I need to finish you.

490
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:52,567
They're from feelings.

491
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,358
Those powers are
derived from emotions.

492
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:56,692
[gasps]

493
00:20:58,192 --> 00:20:59,733
The thing that
makes humans unique

494
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:02,483
in the universe is the variety
of feelings they have.

495
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:04,775
It's what brings them
prosperity, happiness,

496
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:06,733
as well as conflict.

497
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:08,858
[MOB]
Huh? My power...

498
00:21:08,942 --> 00:21:11,650
[MOGAMI] You can't use your
psychic abilities anymore.

499
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:13,525
What I did just then
was measure the power

500
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:16,067
you imagine you have.

501
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,775
It was impressive.

502
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:20,442
I sensed many feelings
pulsing within it.

503
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:22,483
But you seem to be
satisfied with letting

504
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:23,442
others use you.

505
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:25,025
Get out of her. Leave...

506
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:26,858
[MOGAMI] You still don't
understand, do you?

507
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:28,483
This was a trap.

508
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:32,858
[MOGAMI] I allowed you
inside deliberately.

509
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:35,067
I've got another
question for you.

510
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,400
Take two people,
one who lives happily

511
00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:39,233
and another living in misery.

512
00:21:39,317 --> 00:21:42,608
Which of these two people
has stronger feelings?

513
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:44,150
The answer is the latter.

514
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:47,192
Negative feelings are
inherently stronger.

515
00:21:47,275 --> 00:21:48,858
The more stress you
feel, the more weight

516
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:52,608
on your shoulders, the greater
the energy is within you.

517
00:21:52,692 --> 00:21:54,317
But that's good news for you!

518
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,150
It means you can
become even stronger

519
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:58,192
than you are now.

520
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,067
You just have to change
the way you look

521
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,817
at the world a little.

522
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,858
Would you like me to help you?

523
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:06,317
[gasps]

524
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:10,692
It's morning...

525
00:22:12,025 --> 00:22:14,067
[MOGAMI]
Shigeo Kageyama.

526
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,567
Here, you're just a
normal middle schooler.

527
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,067
I've taken the liberty
of altering your

528
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:22,317
memories a bit, as well
as removing your powers.

529
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,483
Change your point of view,

530
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:26,025
and the world's a
totally different place.

531
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:27,942
Now for something
completely different.

532
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:31,608
Let's see what you're like
without your abilities...

533
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:06,942
[MOB]
Huh? What was I doing?

534
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:09,692
I feel like it was
something important...

535
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:11,858
I can't remember at all.

536
00:24:11,942 --> 00:24:14,567
Oh, I need to get to school.

537

<i>100 II</i> , episode five:
