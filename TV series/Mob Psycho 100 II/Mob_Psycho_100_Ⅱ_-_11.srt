[TERUKI]
Well, whattaya know...?

2
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:12,250
Looks like you're
the last man standing.

3
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,750
Damn it! Stupid brats!

00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,083
Who do you think you are?!

Telekinetic Pillar of Flame!

00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,000
This was nothing!
You shouldn't underestimate me--

[groans]

11
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,833
Way to go, you two. Good job.

12
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,583
You've gotten stronger.

13
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,625
We've been practicing every day.

14
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:33,625
It's all thanks to what
you taught us, Teru.

15
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,000
We appreciate
the help, Takeuchi.

16
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,375
[TAKEUCHI]
There's no need to thank me.

17
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,458
I defected from the
organization as well.

18
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,166
[TERADA] And I acted
like I betrayed you

19
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,041
to launch a surprise attack.

20
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,666
Good thing I can
think on my feet

21
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,500
and not fold during
an intense situation.

22
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,500
[TERADA]
I think-- Hey, what the--?

23
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,041
--Why can't I move?
--[TERUKI] Kaito.

[KAITO]
Lie-Detection Telepathy!

25
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,666
Everything's okay.
He hasn't betrayed us yet.

26
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,250
Hey, whattaya mean by "yet"?!

27
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,458
So, what should we do now?

28
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:04,208
Reigen said we didn't have
to fight these guys head on,

29
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,958
but I'm beginning
to think otherwise.

30
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,375
We have to take our city back.

31
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,625
[BOSS]
Pathetic dogs...

32
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,958
They forget how terrifying
their master can be

33
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:52,250
if he's not there to remind
them every minute.

34
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,041
[BOSS]
Sho is here.

35
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,083
Okay, let's go.

36
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,041
[SHO]
Hey, Ritsu. I'm curious.

37
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:02,250
Why are you being
so cooperative?

38
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,916
I think it's because

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,583
I can relate to what
you're going through.

40
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,000
There are times when I worry
about what would happen

41
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,166
if my brother went
berserk with his powers.

42
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,583
Right now, that's exactly
what your father's doing.

43
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,416
And you're probably the only
one who can stop him.

44
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,458
Yeah! I know I can!

45
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,750
I'll show you that
I can finish this!

46
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,875
[SHO gasps]
There he is...

47
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,500
It's Shimazaki!

48
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,583
[RITSU]
I can tell just by looking...

49
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,666
He's really strong!

50
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,250
[SHO] He's a teleporter who can
read his enemy's movements.

51
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,541
--I think we should--
--[RITSU] You go on ahead.

52
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,666
I'll stay behind
and keep him busy.

53
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,541
You can't handle
'im on your own.

54
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,791
He's one of the strongest
in the whole organization.

55
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,375
That's why I'm staying.

56
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:47,250
In return, you've gotta promise
me you'll stop your father.

57
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,666
All right, you have my word.

58
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,083
I sure am glad to
have you around.

Where'd he go?

[RITSU gasps]

65
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,375
[RITSU] Guess he's
not gonna follow Sho...

66
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,083
[SHIMAZAKI]
Looking for me?

67
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,583
Listen, I'd appreciate it if
you wouldn't resist so much.

68
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,125
Bullying the weak isn't
exactly my style.

69
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:31,708
[RITSU] Don't flatter yourself.
You're as weak as I am!

70
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,041
[SHIMAZAKI]
Oh yeah?

71
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,333
You're about to find out
just how wrong you are.

[RITSU grunts]

73
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,833
[SHO] I should've taken him out
way before it got to this point.

74
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,833
But, I was so powerless
I couldn't do anything

75
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,791
but sit back and watch...

76
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,416
[HATORI]
That's far enough.

77
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,875
Such a shame to come
all this way for nothing.

78
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,708
Now you'll have to deal with me.

79
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,125
[SHO] My dad uses his
abilities for evil.

80
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,083
I'm going to use mine
to show him what's right!

81
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,666
[SHO]
I'll put an end to this!

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,541
[MOB] How awful. Someone did
this with their psychic powers?

83
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,625
[DIMPLE] They're using that
tower as their base.

84
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,458
Reigen and the others
should be here, soon.

00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,666
Hey. Some brat just walked up.
Too scared to run?

87
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,541
[CLAW MEMBER 11C] I grabbed
some good stuff for dinner!

Now they're looting.

[MOB] I've gone to that
store with Ritsu before.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,750
[MOB] Put back what you took.
Stealing's a crime.

--You should know better.
--Who the hell are you, kid?

[CLAW MEMBER A]
Don't you watch the news?

94
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,541
This town belongs to us now.

You're gonna traumatize him.

Listen to me.
You shouldn't do this.

[CLAW MEMBER A]
Huh?

102
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,125
Could you actually plant
and grow the vegetables

103
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,750
in this sandwich?

104
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,875
Or fix that glass
door you broke?

105
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:03,541
Could psychic powers... help you
come up with a useful invention?

106
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,291
Or heal someone who's sick?

107
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,625
What're you trying to say?!

108
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,166
[MOB] Sorry, but you guys
are making a huge mistake.

109
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,375
You believe you're special

110
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,750
just because of your
psychic abilities.

111
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,958
None of you would be able
to survive on your own.

Not without the help of others.

Whatever, jackass!

114

As long as you have power, you
can make anyone submit to you!

115

Oh, that reminds me...

116
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,458
Never use your powers
against others.

117

If you haven't come across
someone who can show you why...

...then allow me.

[MINEGISHI]
Well, well...

Looks like we had quite the
stray show up at our doorstep.

124

I'll take him down.

[MOB gasps]

127
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,875
[MINEGISHI] These things
will keep growing forever

128
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,250
as long as I give
them enough energy.

129
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,708
On top of that, I can
make as many as I want.

130
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:02,875
[MOB grunts]

131
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,208
Guess you can do it, too.

132
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,416
[MOB] Seems to me... you don't
really like plants, do you?

133
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,416
[MINEGISHI] That's right.
They're nothing but tools.

All right! Drop him!

Don't let Minegishi down!

[RITSU grunts]

138
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,875
[SHIMAZAKI] Fighting those more
powerful than you is useless.

139
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,791
You should join our side.

140
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,583
[RITSU]
That might be a little easier.

141
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,875
But, it isn't half as much fun.

142
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,458
[SHIMAZAKI]
Hm...

143
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,416
The difference in our skills
should be obvious by now.

144
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,041
Sure you won't change your mind?

145
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,458
Maybe you just need a
bit more persuasion.

146
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,500
[RITSU] I always wanted to be
able to use psychic powers.

147
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,666
But now that mine
have finally awakened,

148
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,083
I've come to
understand something.

149
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,416
What I really wanted
was to give something

150
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,583
every ounce of energy I had...
To shed all the blood, sweat,

151
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:08,333
and tears inside me to ensure
I could live a fun life.

152
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:12,416
I won't let you or
anyone take that away!

153
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,750
Guess you might not be such
a good fit for us after all.

154
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,666
No hard feelings, kid.

155
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,833
Oh, man...

156
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,125
I managed to land a hit on him!

157
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:28,041
[SHIMAZAKI] My, my. You're more
resilient than I'd imagined.

158
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,583
[SAKURAI] We need to repay
you for what you did.

159
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:34,083
Guess you're not sewer rats.
You're cockroaches.

160
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,166
[TSUCHIYA] We've changed
since we were in Claw.

161
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,416
[MURAKI] Now that we're
living on our own terms,

162
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
you'll find we're much stronger.

163
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,916
[SHIMAZAKI] But that won't
change the outcome.

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,750
[TERUKI] Don't act so tough.
We know you're panicking.

165
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,458
You can read our moves,
but at some point,

166
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,333
there'll be too many
of us to keep up with.

167
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,583
It's time for round two!

168
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,916
[TERADA shouts]

169
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,541
[TSUCHIYA]
Takeuchi!

170
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,000
[TAKEUCHI shouts]

171
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,791
[TSUCHIYA grunts]

172
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,791
[TAKEUCHI]
Tsuchiya!

173
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,041
[TAKEUCHI grunts]

174
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,458
[TERUKI grunts]

175
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,833
[KOYAMA]
Not happening, freakshow!

176
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,750
[gasps]

177
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,500
[TERADA grunts]

178
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,291
[SHIMAZAKI]
Aren't you gonna shoot?

179
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,750
[SHIMAZAKI gasps]

180
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,625
[gasps]

181
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,958
[SHIMAZAKI] Trying to pin me
down is a waste of time.

182
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,041
[SAKURAI shouts]

183
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,125
[SHIMAZAKI]
I told you.

184
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:40,208
[SHIMAZAKI] Nothing you do
will change the outcome.

185
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,375
Hm?

186
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,375
[SHIMAZAKI]
Oh?

187
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,708
[TERUKI] Keep hitting him hard
and fast! The more we do...

188
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,208
...the easier it is to tell
where he'll teleport!

189
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,000
[MOB] They're stronger
than the division guys...

190
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,666
Don't let up, Shigeo!

191
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,458
[CLAW MEMBER F] Yes!
He's scared now! Keep it up!

192
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,708
[CLAW MEMBERS gasp, shout]

193
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,333
[MATSUO] Looks like you're
having some trouble.

194
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,708
[MOB]
Aren't you...?

195
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,500
I'm happy to lend you a
hand with him, if you like.

196
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,375
Go, my children!

197
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,250
[CLAW MEMBER A] It's Matsuo,
the evil-spirit user!

198
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,833
[CLAW MEMBER B] He's gonna
launch a monster-assault on us!

199
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,583
[MINEGISHI]
You shouldn't underestimate me.

200
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,041
--[MATSUO grunts]
--Matsuo!

201
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,083
[MOB gasps]

202
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,916
[CLAW MEMBER A]
What's with the weird bottle?

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,833
Talk about bad taste.

204
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,000
[MATSUO]
No! Please! Anything but that!

205
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,958
Even I can't control him!
Don't touch it!

206
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,291
Dumbass.

207
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,916
With Minegishi on our side,
nothing scares us!

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,375
[MATSUO gasps]

209
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:51,833
Huh? What happened?
Why is everyone--?

210
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,041
[MOGAMI groans]

211
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,500
What the hell? What is that?!

212
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,416
[MOB]
Mogami!

213
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,166
Not good.

214
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,958
What happened to him?

215
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,000
[MOGAMI] First, you trap
me in the Poison Jar,

216
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,083
and now you want me
to devour espers.

217
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,916
You're such lowly creatures...

218
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:17,000
[gasps]
What the hell is that thing?!

219
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,291
[MINEGISHI] My plants!
They aren't listening to me!

220
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,916
[MINEGISHI yells]

221
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:38,250
[MINEGISHI grunts]

222
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,791
[MOB]
No! Stop!

223
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,375
[MOGAMI]
Why should I?

224
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,625
I've been watching, and none of
these insects deserve to live.

225
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,083
Some people never change,

226
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,166
no matter how many
chances you give them.

227
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,458
But they still might be able to!

228
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,250
Promise you won't do
anything bad ever again!

229
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,416
I-I promise, I won't.
Just spare me, please!

230
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,541
See?!

231
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,208
What if he's just
lying to stay alive?

232
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,625
Are you going to
personally watch over

233
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,500
these people to see if
they've reformed?

234
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,416
Do you think you can keep
an eye on them forever?

235
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,708
[MOB]
Well... no.

236
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:15,416
But we need to have faith in
one another to get through life.

237
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,833
If we can't do that,
then we'll never get anywhere.

238
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,125
[MOGAMI]
Predictable, coming from you.

239
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,916
But there are things in this
world that can't be solved

240
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,750
with mere kindness.

241
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:30,333
Sometimes, it's necessary
to be tough on people.

242
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,000
If you can learn to do that,

243
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:36,000
you will be invincible,
Shigeo Kageyama.

244
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,000
[DIMPLE] Do you think
Mogami disappeared for good

245
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,708
this time, or...?

246
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,833
Be tough on people, huh?

247
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,750
I'm not very good at that.

248
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,875
[SHO] I finally made it here
and Claw's finished, Father!

249
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,083
[BOSS] Sho. Surely,
there's a better way

250
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,458
for us to handle this.

251
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,875
We're family, after all.

252
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,250
What? So now you want
to act like a father?

253
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,125
You've never cared about
a damn thing I did or said.

254
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,500
Should've attacked while
playing the obedient son.

255
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,666
--What a wasted opportunity.
--[growls]

256
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,083
[BOSS] Now don't get
in my way any further.

257
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,708
It took me 20 years
to get to this point.

258
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,250
[SHO]
So what?!

259
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,666
Seeing all those years go down
the drain serves you right!

260
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,250
I'm just as strong
as the Ultimate 5!

261
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,666
Come on! Fight me, man to man!

262
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,416
Don't make me laugh.

263
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,791
You underestimate me.

264
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,083
[SHO] So, you've got a powerful
barrier that activates

265
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:32,416
when I get too close.
Is that your true power?

266
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,791
In that case...!

267
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,916
[gasps, grunts]

268
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,291
[SHO]
Damn it! He's mocking me!

269
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,666
[gasps]

270
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,916
[BOSS] These techniques
are child's play.

271
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,625
[BOSS]
How disappointing.

272
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,208
I thought you would've grown
a little more than that.

273
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,083
[BOSS] Oh... You've learned
to control the degree of

274
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,958
light refraction around you?

275
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,958
[SHO]
Here's the ace up my sleeve!

276
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,541
Three months' worth of
stored-up energy...

277
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,875
Charge Bomb!

278
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,291
Hell, yeah! Justice prevails!

279
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,916
[gasps]

280
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,375
[SERIZAWA] Really sorry...
Bad time for my bathroom break.

281
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,750
[BOSS]
No, that's all right.

282
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,333
This is just his
rebellious phase.

283
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,083
Misbehaving again?

284
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,500
You won't turn out to be
a decent adult like that.

285
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:28,208
[SHO] Screw you! That was
three months' worth of energy!

286
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,750
[SERIZAWA] Let's stop
fighting and take over

287
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,125
the world together!
What do you say?

288
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,875
Don't bother.
His mind's made up.

289
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,208
But I understand why Sho
disagrees with what I'm doing.

290
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,708
You fear this plan
will fail, don't you?

291
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,333
Well, that's because
you don't know the truth.

292
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,083
While I was seeking out new
members of Claw, the real

293
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,333
reason I went around the world
was to see if global domination

294
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,666
would actually be possible.
But after my search,

295
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,750
I couldn't find a single esper
stronger than me, anywhere.

296
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,958
I have been bestowed
with the ultimate power.

297
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,791
[SHO] And you think that
somehow gives you the right

298
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,416
to take over the world?

299
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,791
Hear that, Serizawa? He's crazy!
Totally messed up in the head!

300
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,250
President...

301
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,291
You're so cool.

302
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,625
[SHO grunts] Idiots with power
are the worst to deal with!

303
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,166
[BOSS] Your last attack
was quite impressive.

304
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,291
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

305
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,416
Don't talk like that!
We're not the same!

306
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,875
[BOSS] You said you'd been
charging up energy and saving it

307
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,916
for the past three months?
I have the same ability.

308
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,083
--What?!
--[BOSS] Didn't I tell you?

309
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:32,166
I've spent the past 20 years
preparing for this moment.

310
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,958
[SHO] You weren't just gathering
troops and scouting around.

311
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,500
You were...!

312
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:40,625
Would you like to see a little
of what I've been saving up?

313
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,708
--[gunshots]
--[SAKURAI groans]

314
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,625
[SHIMAZAKI] You poor Scars don't
know when to quit, do you?

315
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,416
Just face it. You're outgunned
and outmatched.

316
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,708
[KOYAMA]
Shut it!

317
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,791
You're a damn coward
who doesn't have the guts

318
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,375
to go against the boss!

319
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,625
[SHIMAZAKI chuckles]
The reason he named you "Scars"

320
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,500
is 'cause you're all
disappointments. Failures.

321
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,583
Every one of you was considered
damaged goods from the start.

322
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,791
[KOYAMA growls]
I'll show you "damaged"!

323
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,833
Telekinetic Helix!

324
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,750
[SHIMAZAKI] Even my most
basic abilities as an esper...

325
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:14,083
...are far more powerful
than all of yours combined.

326
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,791
[SHIMAZAKI]
I'll say it one more time...

327
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,666
Stop resisting and give up.

328
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,000
[gunshots]

329
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,416
[SAKURAI]
You say that, but...

330
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,875
...that manhole cover
hurt just now, didn't it?

331
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,208
[RITSU gasps]
Hey, Teru!

332
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,791
Yeah. So, it looks
like if he can't detect

333
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,333
the attack in advance...

334
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,708
...then he can't stop it.

335
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,000
He's the one who's
been cornered here!

336
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,125
[sighs]

337
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,458
You're are a smart
one, aren't you...?

338
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,666
And that means...

339
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,666
[TERUKI grunts]

340
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,791
[glass shattering]

341
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,666
...you'll be the first to die.

342
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,416
But, you won't be the last.

343
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,000
[TERUKI gasps]

344
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:58,916

[SHIMAZAKI yells]

346
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,083
[TSUCHIYA]
This is bad. He'll kill him.

347
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,250
What can we do?

348
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,500
Enough. It's time to end this.

349
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,708
--[gasps]
--[TERUKI] Next, from behind!

350
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,875
How'd you--?!

351
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,000
[TERUKI] It might
be convenient to be able

352
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,708
to read your opponents' moves...

353
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,583
...but it makes your own
movements really simplistic.

354
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,500
You rely too much
on your powers.

355
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,625
[grunts, yells]

356
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,458
[SHIMAZAKI]
Well, I'm shocked.

357
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,916
'Cause other than the boss...

358
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,375
...the world's greatest
esper is yours truly.

359
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,750
[laughs]

360
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,541
Don't flatter yourself!

361
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,250
There are people in
this world with abilities

362
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,958
you can't even fathom.

363
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,166
You're not that special at all.

364
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,958
I mean, even I could defeat you.

365
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,416
Why you--
[grunts]

366
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,583
[RITSU] You're right!
It's when he's distracted!

367
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,458
[TERUKI]
Nice one! Way to go, Ritsu!

Get a hold of yourself...

[KOYAMA bellows]

374
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,083
[SHIMAZAKI]
Y-You need to focus...

375
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,791
Just concentrate and
you'll figure everything out.

376
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,750
Everyone here is an esper.

377
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,958
Ignore everything but them...

378
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,375
Concentrate. Concentrate...

379
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,208
Mind's Eye!

380
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,958
[SHIMAZAKI] There's nothing
you can do that will

381
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,041
ever work on me again.

382
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,583
Your injuries, the weaknesses
you're not even aware of yet...

383
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,208
Your blurred vision...

384
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,916
I can see through
anything and everything.

385
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,250
It's too late to
have any regrets.

[SHIMAZAKI gasps]

387
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,541
[TERUKI]
What's wrong?

388
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,125
[SHIMAZAKI]
It feels like...

389
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:18,125
...something with tremendous
energy is heading this way.

390
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm pretty sure I know
who that would be.

391
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,291
I guess you finally woke up...

392
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,625
...Kageyama.

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,291
[SHIMAZAKI laughs]

You're kidding, right?

could possibly be greater!

Self-Defense Rush!

[NARRATOR] Another one
of Reigen's special moves!

400
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,541
When it's unclear if it's
actually self-defense,

401
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,583
he'll yell out "Self-Defense!"
just to be safe.

402
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,500
[SHIMAZAKI yells]

403
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,541
[SHIMAZAKI] Impossible!
I couldn't sense him at all.

404
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,166
Who is he?!

405
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,583
Hey, Reigen!

406
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,666
[MURAKI] Everyone, get up!
The great master is here!

407
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,416
[SHIMAZAKI] What did he say?
Don't tell me...

408
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,541
There's an esper who can make

409
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,208
every trace of his
presence disappear?

410
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,916
What should I do? Withdraw?

411
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,750
Master. This one is
actually really strong.

412
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,375
So please step back.
I can handle him.

413
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,125
That boy from earlier,

414
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:19,125
and this unknown esper...
How many are there?

415
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,666
Are they actually
a huge organization?

416
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,750
More importantly, this kid is
on an entirely different level.

417
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,375
Heh.

418
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,083
Look, I give up, okay?

419
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,333
It's not worth
the risk. I'm done.

420
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,791
[REIGEN] Well, that was a lot
easier than I thought it'd be.

421
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,958
What happened to
taking over the world?

422
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,166
The boss is the only
one gunning for that.

423
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,041
As long as I'm having fun,
I don't really care.

424
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,833
[MOB]
As long as you're having fun?

425
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,333
Huh?

426
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,291
You disrupted the lives of
all those people just for that?

427
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,583
Are you serious?

428
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,708
[SHIMAZAKI gasps]

429
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,708
[TERADA]
The little coward ran away!

430
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,333
[KOYAMA] Does that...
even count as a win?

431
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,291
Who knows?
He may strike again.

432
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,541
No, I'm pretty sure
he's gone for good.

433
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,166
After going through that,

434
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,041
he'll probably change
his ways from now on.

435
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,166
Shige.

436
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,833
Ah, Ritsu! You okay?

437
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,208
Yeah.

438
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,500
And Mom and Dad are somewhere
safe and sound, too.

439
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,583
Thank goodness.

440
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,750
It's just like Dimple
and Master said.

441
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,041
[DIMPLE] That was one
hell of a scare, huh...?

442
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,875
[REIGEN]
Ah, shut up...

443
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,833
[TERUKI] I guess all we have
left is the last boss.

444
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,708
Hoshino and the others should
be getting people to safety.

445
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,416
Let's regroup with them
and begin our attack.

446
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,250
[MOB] No. You've all
suffered injuries.

447
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,958
I'll go in alone.

448
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,708
[TERUKI]
Wait... Kageyama!

449
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,208
What are you talking about?!

450
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,625
I wanna go, too!

451
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,666
One of my friends
already went in!

452
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,250
[MOB]
No.

453
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,500
This might be hard to hear,
but you'll just be in my way.

454
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,916
I'm sorry.

455
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,708
[DIMPLE]
"Be tough on people..."

456
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:53,250
So that's how Shigeo interpreted
what Mogami told him...

457
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,333
Dimple, stay with him.

458
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,625
Yeah, yeah I know...

459
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:34,250
[DIMPLE] Aren't you scared
to do this on your own?

460
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,333
[MOB]
Of course. But, still...

461
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,291
Having someone else get hurt
scares me even more.

462
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,500
I'm sure I'll figure
something out.

463
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,083
[DIMPLE]
Crap...

464
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,208
I'm trying to take advantage of
him while he's still a kid...

465
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,500
...but Shigeo's going to be
an adult before I know it.

466
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,625
--[clack]
--[MOB] Hmm.

467
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:53,250
[SERIZAWA]
Damn. You're just a small fry...

468
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,333
Are you even in middle school?

469
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:58,250
This is a really bad
time for a field trip.

470
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:01,166
Would you be so kind
as to leave the premises?

471
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,541
[REIGEN] Mob finally infiltrates
the enemy's base.

472
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,708
Can he get past Serizawa
and make it to the boss?

473
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,000
After defeating his son Sho,

474
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,708
the boss reveals
his true identity.

475
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,916
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho</i>
<i>100</i> II, Episode 12:

Rehabilitation ~Friendship~."

477
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,833
