a mysterious illness,

You're not really
that stupid, are ya?

Yup, actually, I am.

Let me guess:
this is the first time

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,275
someone's placed so much
trust in you, too, right?

U-Uh...

Mob only trusts us
because he's stupid.

See how that works?

167
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:55,567
I've still got plenty
of use for him.

168
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,317
And considering
that, running away

169
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,567

And since that's
not going to change,

174
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:10,025
it'd be more effective
to manipulate him

from the shadows.

[MOB grunts]

323
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,192
[MOB] I'm going to defeat
this evil spirit

324
00:14:41,275 --> 00:14:42,775
and go back to reality.

325
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:44,233
[MOGAMI]
And what good would that do?

326
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:45,567
Your life won't change,

327
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,733
nor will the
absurdity of society.

328
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:49,358
There will always be
plenty of things

in the world to bring you down.

330
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:55,775
[MOB]
The outside world is... scary?

331
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:59,192
[MOGAMI] Yes. Life is
frustrating, devoid of meaning,

332
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:02,108
and so, so painful.

333
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,817
I can hear them.

334
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,942
[MOB]
The voices of the dead...

335
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:07,817
They're speaking to me.

336
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,192
So many screams...

337
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:13,317
They died feeling like this?

338
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,150
Is this how they felt
when they were alive?

339
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:19,733
The world can be
such a cruel place.

[MOB]
Wait... That's right.

345
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:32,900
I remember now. I came
here to save someone.

346
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,025
[MOB] I always thought
these powers were trivial.

347
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:41,650
That they were no
good to anybody.

348
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,692
But I can use them
to save people!

349
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:48,942
It doesn't matter what you do.
You can never defeat me!

00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,608
[DIMPLE]
Well, I'll be damned. Shigeo...

351
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:06,900
You did it!

00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:14,858
[MOGAMI] You're not the
same boy from earlier.

353
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:18,900
Tell me. Who are you?

354
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:20,567
Now you're gonna find
out just how strong

this kid really is!

You're looking at the

he's super pissed!

[DIMPLE]
He really has changed, huh?

363
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:38,358
[NARRATOR]
Mogami had made the mistake

364
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:41,817
of overlooking something
that lay dormant within Mob.

365
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,150
Hearts are made up of two sides.

366
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:47,150
Just as happiness gleams
in the shadows of sorrow...

367
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,233
...only in the darkest
depths of fear

368

Or at least, that's
how it looked...

lost me, their vessel,

all of the evil spirits
I'd taken in and controlled

376

will be freed into the

I'll keep watching
from afar to see

if you made the right one.

anywhere, my pet.

That people are able to change.

439
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:19,775
Mogami and Minori both taught
me that it's possible.

00:22:19,858 --> 00:22:23,067
The people around me
changed me, as well.

Now I understand that I can do
the same thing for others, too.

So what you're saying is:

447
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,358
the one who saved you was a boy
in the same grade as you?

Yeah, why do you ask?

00:22:42,983 --> 00:22:44,275
[ASAGIRI] Well, there
wasn't a middle school

He wasn't even
asked to be there,

but somehow he
managed to cast out

00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:52,983
an evil spirit that
nobody else could,

455
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:54,942
and then left without
saying a word.

That's so cool.

I hope I can see him again.

Our religious organization

Why aren't you
claiming your reward?

Just look at how
many people got hurt.

Not exactly a big success.

You should never accept money

475
00:23:37,442 --> 00:23:39,567
That's not it, moron!

476
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,733
Anyway, history has shown us
that no good ever comes out

477
00:23:42,817 --> 00:23:45,692
of drowning in wealth,
fame, or power.

478
00:23:45,775 --> 00:23:47,942
Think about it: Mogami
let his own powers

479
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:49,900
swallow him up, too.

480
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:51,233
You know...

481
00:23:51,317 --> 00:23:53,817
You're better off
working part-time for me

482
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,483
than becoming famous
or powerful.

483
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,233
I hope this serves as
a good lesson for ya.

484
00:23:58,317 --> 00:24:01,983
Come on, give me
a friggin' break...

We're busy here!

488
00:24:07,858 --> 00:24:09,733
They're just using you, anyway!

489
00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:12,067
Jeez. You never learn, do ya?

490
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,567
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho</i>
<i>100 II</i> , episode six:

491
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,150
"Poor, Lonely, Whitey."

492
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:18,233
The DVDs? That's an
excellent decision!
