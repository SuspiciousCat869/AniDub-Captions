00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:45,233
on all of us simultaneously.

164
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,108
I'm just impressed you survived.

165
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:48,567
Who do you think we are?

166
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,900
We're former Scars,
so we can handle it.

167
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:52,442
Right, Tsucchi?

168
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:53,942
Yeah.

169
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:56,942
But the real battle begins
when the guys from HQ show up.

170
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:59,275
After that, we realized
if we're going

171
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:00,775
to stand a chance against them,

172
00:09:00,858 --> 00:09:03,067
we need to make sure
we have a good leader.

173
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,317
Smart choice.

174
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,733
And naturally, that led
them to my door.

175
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:09,108
Shut up. It's better that way.

176
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:12,108
When Master Reigen put the TV
and media people in their place,

177
00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:14,275
we thought it was a genius move.

178
00:09:14,358 --> 00:09:16,650
He sees the bigger picture
and makes things happen.

179
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:19,483
The exact qualities
we're looking for.

180
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:22,817
[DIMPLE] Are they serious?
Talk about misguided.

181
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,442
Wait, didn't Claw
come after you, too?

182
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,900
Yeah, my office was destroyed.

183
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,858
Fortunately for me,
I just happened to be away

184
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:32,442
the moment it was incinerated.

185
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:34,775
With the flood of new clients
my TV appearance brought me,

186
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:37,067
I thought I'd invest
in some renovations.

187
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,692
That's my office, by the
sign on the building.

188
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:42,317
The one that's... burning...

189
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,442
[REIGEN] So, those renovations
will have to wait.

190
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:49,650
After that, the former
Claw guys picked me up.

191
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,692
I was already exhausted
from the marathon.

192
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:53,858
Man, talk about a crappy day.

193
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:56,942
Huh. Makes me wonder
if Teru's doing okay.

194
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:59,067
Oh! I got a message
from him earlier.

195
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,733
He said he's just fine.

196
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:02,275
[ASAHI]
When did that happen?

197
00:10:02,358 --> 00:10:03,608
[ASAHI, HOSHINO]
This sucks.

198
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:05,775
So, what are you
guys doing here?

199
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:07,733
After what happened
with the 7th Division,

200
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,525
we're trying to lay low.

201
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:11,233
Mitsuura called and
said he'd prepared

202
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:12,733
this hideout for us.

203
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:14,567
I can't believe there
are so many espers

204
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,733
in one spot! This is
so freakin' cool!

205
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,067
Oh, him.

206
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:21,108
[ALL gasp]

207
00:10:21,192 --> 00:10:22,858
[HOSHINO, ASAHI]
Teru!

208
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:26,025
Hey. Well, it looks like
the gang's all here.

209
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:28,567
[MAYUO]
You fools!

210
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,233
If you punks think
you can make me talk,

211
00:10:30,317 --> 00:10:32,608
then you're dead wrong,
you understand me?!

212
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:34,192
I'm a member of Cla--!

213
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:35,858
[MAYUO yelps]

214
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:37,108
[TERADA]
Is that so?

215
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:40,983
Stop resisting, nobody
can endure this torture.

216
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:41,817
[MAYUO gasps]

217
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,983
Sorry! I'll talk!

218
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,567
The boss has been
going around the world

219
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,608
scouting powerful espers
until the other day

220
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:51,192
when he said that he finally had
all of the soldiers he needed!

221
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,692
I see.

222
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:55,817
Gathering espers from
around the world, huh?

223
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,275
[MAYUO] Don't tell me you idiots
still plan on facing us

224
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,400
after hearing that!

225
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:01,900
We've got an army of powerful--

226
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:04,942
Master Reigen.
What should we do now?

227
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:06,275
Hmph!

228
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:09,400
There's no way we're just
gonna let this slide.

229
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:11,192
Let's report them to the police.

230
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:14,650
[gasps]

231
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,275
[JOSEPH]
Amazing isn't it?

232
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:26,858
This whole civilization was
built by ordinary humans.

233
00:11:26,942 --> 00:11:30,483
I'm so excited. I can't
wait to destroy it.

234
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:33,233
That is why we came to
this country, isn't it?

235
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,983
Not me.

236
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:37,442
I came for the money.

237
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:49,192
[BOSS]
Ladies and gentlemen...

238
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,442
Thank you all for gathering
on this historic day.

239
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:53,650
For those of you
who don't know,

240
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:57,108
I'm Toichiro Suzuki,
the leader of Claw.

241
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:59,025
The time is finally upon us.

242
00:11:59,108 --> 00:12:02,233
We are about to declare
war on the entire world.

243
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:04,067
After 20 years, I finally have

244
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,567
the funds and manpower
needed to wage this battle.

245
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,233
Our revolution will
begin with destruction.

246
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:12,192
The annihilation of
everything that people

247
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:14,442
built and hold dear.

248
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,900
Let us show the
powerless that our kind

249
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:19,150
will no longer hide
in the shadows!

250
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:20,608
[CLAW MEMBERS cheer]

251
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:22,650
Huh. World Domination.

252
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:24,525
Seems pretty ambitious to me

253
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:26,275
Are the preparations complete?

254
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:28,567
There's nothing
I need to prepare.

255
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:32,525
[MEMBER 09A]
What are they doing?

256
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:33,858
[MEMBER 09B]
Is that a camera?

257
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:41,108
You're now live
on every channel.

258
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:43,067
[NARRATOR] Hatori's
psychic ability allows him

259
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,983
to infiltrate and
control systems dealing

260
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:47,233
with electronic
devices or waves.

261
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:50,358
And he has no idea
how it actually works.

262
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:52,817
Wow. He's good.

263
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,067
[BOSS]
Attention.

264
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,983
We are an organization
of espers known as Claw.

265
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,983
We've taken over the airwaves
with our psychic powers.

266
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:02,025
And that is but
a single fraction

267
00:13:02,108 --> 00:13:04,567
of what we are truly capable of.

268
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,150
Our abilities are far superior
to all modern weaponry.

269
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:11,858
I warn you: it's not
advisable to oppose us.

270
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:13,692
We will soon control
the world using

271
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:16,192
our psychic powers
and begin ruling over

272
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:18,608
you defenseless humans.

273
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:21,108
The first step in our
mission is to completely

274
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:23,025
demolish this country.

275
00:13:23,108 --> 00:13:25,733
A new world order
is about to begin.

276
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:28,275
I look forward to ruling you.

277
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,817
[SHO pants]

278
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,150
I can't believe it.

279
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:35,692
How dare you...

280
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:38,942
...embarrass your own
son like this again?!

281
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:41,150
I will be the one
to defeat him!

282
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:42,650
Got that, Ritsu?!

283
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:43,525
Got it.

284
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:45,025
All right! Let's go!

285
00:13:45,108 --> 00:13:46,233
Hang on a second.

286
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:48,025
[SHO] You're still not
on board with this?

287
00:13:48,108 --> 00:13:49,108
What's the hold up?

288
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:51,358
What about my family's safety?

289
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:53,817
Oh. Don't worry about
a thing, 'cause we have

290
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,858
somebody keeping a close
eye on your parents

291
00:13:55,942 --> 00:13:57,233
from a distance.

292
00:13:57,317 --> 00:13:59,775
See? They're fine.

293
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:01,317
We told your mom
and dad that you

294
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,192
wanted to do something
nice for them...

295
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,900
...so you entered a hot springs
hotel lottery and won!

296
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:08,108
And they totally fell for it!

297
00:14:08,192 --> 00:14:11,358
[RITSU] You were really
pushing it with a lie that big.

298
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:14,983
Their hotel doesn't have ties
to anything shady, does it?

299
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,317
[SHO]
Hey, don't worry.

300
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,858
They offer traditional
seafood, farm-fresh meals,

301
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,650
and accommodate allergies, too.

302
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:21,650
It's pretty posh.

303
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:24,358
That's not what
I'm talking about!

304
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:26,317
And what about my brother?

305
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,692
He's still not
answering his phone.

306
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:31,608
I'm sure he's safe.
But he won't fight.

307
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:33,233
I could see it in his eyes.

308
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:37,275
He's not the type to blow up
without a really good reason.

309
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:39,525
I think I gave him a
pretty good one, though.

310
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:40,733
[RITSU]
What do you mean?

311
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:43,358
Did you do something
after we left the house?

312
00:14:43,442 --> 00:14:45,025
Listen, if you did
anything that might've

313
00:14:45,108 --> 00:14:46,942
pissed my brother off...

314
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:48,525
...then you're in big trouble.

315
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:49,900
Heh.

316
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:53,817
Sounds like you've had
a pretty hard life too, then.

317
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,483
Let me explain that plan
the boss was talking about.

318
00:14:57,567 --> 00:15:00,025
In Japan, the total
number of policemen

319
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,775
and military personnel
who have guns

320
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:04,442

...then let me teach you
a lesson by taking you down.

480
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:11,650
What an odd reply
to my question.

481
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:14,150
Whatever. Give it
a shot, if you like.

482
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,692
[TERUKI]
Telekinetic Explosion!

483
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:19,233
Air Whips!

484
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:23,067
[TERUKI]
Where'd he go?

485
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:26,900
[TERUKI]
What? I was too careless!

486
00:21:26,983 --> 00:21:28,775
[TERUKI]
Pyrokinesis!

487
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:37,275
[TERUKI]
I lost sight of him again.

488
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:39,775
Is this guy's power...?

489
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:41,775
Looking for me?

490
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:42,942
[yelps]

491
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:50,358
[pants]

492
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,358
[TERUKI]
Super speed movement?

493
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:53,733
In that case...

494
00:21:53,817 --> 00:21:55,567
Multi-Layer Barrier!

495
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:00,650
[TERUKI] My new technique where
I overlap multiple barriers...

496
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:02,150
It should be enough
to hold him off

497
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:04,608
until the others get here.

498
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:06,817
[SHIMAZAKI]
Aren't you multi-talented?

499
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,150
[TERUKI gasps]

500
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:14,775
[TERUKI]
He's that quick?

501
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:16,942
Thanks for entertaining me.

502
00:22:20,858 --> 00:22:21,942
[TERUKI groans]

503
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,400
[SAKURAI]
Hanazawa! Hey! Wake up!

504
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:33,400
[KOYAMA] Why the hell'd
you run off on your own?!

505
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,775
[REIGEN] The Ultimate 5 of Claw,
terrorize Seasoning City.

506
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:07,983
Meanwhile, the esper squad

507
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:09,650
and the boss's son,
Sho, make their moves.

508
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:11,608
This is no time to
be sleeping, Mob!

509
00:24:11,692 --> 00:24:13,817
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho</i>
<i>100 II</i> , episode ten:

510
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,233
"Collision ~Power Type~."

511
00:24:15,317 --> 00:24:16,525
What do I recommend?

512
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:18,567
The convenient Blu-ray set
with bonus features!
