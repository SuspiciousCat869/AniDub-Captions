[NEWSCASTER 10A] We've just
received word that Claw,

the esper terrorist
organization,

3
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:15,775
has barricaded itself inside
the Seasoning Cultural Tower.

4
00:00:15,858 --> 00:00:17,442
It's possible that
Prime Minister Yabe,

5
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:19,358
who was abducted
from Pork Bone City,

6
00:00:19,442 --> 00:00:21,483
is being held prisoner inside--

7
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:24,233
The PM's kidnapper
was a teleporter.

00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:26,942
He can travel anywhere
in an instant.

[MITSUURA] And according to
what they said on the news,

00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:31,233
he can also predict
people's movements.

11
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:32,983
Well, that's not fair at all.

12
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:36,817
How can one person have two
overpowered abilities like that?

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,233
Is that why you developed
a fever? His psychic powers?

14
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:43,442
No. Actually, it's from
the shock of losing.

15
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:45,942
I had one just like this
when I lost to Kageyama

16
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:47,900
and had nightmares for days.

17
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:49,650
This guy is bad news.

18
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:51,983
Could they have more espers
with powers like his?

19
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:54,233
I've always been
pretty confident.

20
00:00:54,317 --> 00:00:56,233
Thought I could take on anyone.

21
00:00:56,317 --> 00:01:00,400
But now, I don't know.
I'm not sure what to think.

[SHIMAZAKI]
I don't get it.

23
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:38,608
Why'd we move away
from the capital?

24
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,400
If we'd stayed, we
could've just taken over

25
00:02:40,483 --> 00:02:42,650
the tallest building in Japan.

26
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:44,567
There are two reasons.

27
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,025
First, the rice omelets
in the cafeteria here

28
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:48,358
are to die for.

29
00:02:48,442 --> 00:02:51,483
They use four large
eggs per serving.

30
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:54,400
The second reason is
because I'm from this city.

31
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:57,775
Since I know it so well,
I can easily detect any changes.

32
00:02:57,858 --> 00:02:59,900
So this place is
special to you, huh?

33
00:02:59,983 --> 00:03:01,858
Maybe some family and
friends who're still

34
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:03,525
living in your old neighborhood?

35
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:05,192
No, just a familiarity.

36
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:07,650
It's purely tactical.
I've no attachment.

37
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:09,983
I don't mind if you
destroy the entire city.

38
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:13,025
Yeah? Even the place
with the rice omelets?

39
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:16,233
Heh. That's correct.

All units, prepare

Of course not! It was

00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:37,067
You guys...

162
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,233
They've got this,
Ritsu! Let's go!

163
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,775
[RITSU]
I have my doubts.

164
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:45,983
[CRAW MEMBER 10A]
Hey! Look up in the sky!

165
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:48,400
[CRAW MEMBER 10B]
Whoa! What's going on?

166
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:50,233
[CRAW MEMBER 10C] Are the
government's espers attacking?

167
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:51,858
Shoot 'em down!

168
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:58,400
[REIGEN] None of us
will be in those cars.

169
00:07:58,483 --> 00:08:00,108
The first step in our
plan is to break up

170
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:01,692
the enemy's formation.

171
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:03,275
The goal is to try
and buy as much time

172
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,275
as we can before
they realize the cars

173
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:06,650
are simply decoys.

174
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:08,192
Hey, uh... Teru.

175
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:11,108
So, um, is my telekinesis
helping at all?

176
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:12,150
Yeah.

177
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,692
It's kinda like
somebody using their

178
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:16,442
pinky finger to try and
help carry heavy luggage.

179
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:18,983
[HOSHINO] Was it too much
to just say "not really"?

180
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:26,900
[TERUKI] Damn it. This is
too much to do alone!

181
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:28,983
[TAKEUCHI] Would you like
some help, young man?

182
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:30,192
[TERUKI]
Who are you?

183
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:32,108
[TERADA] You decided
to show up, too, huh?

184
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:33,733
My name is Takeuchi.

185
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:37,483
I am a master of the miraculous
art of super qigong.

186
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:40,358
You just need to make
some cars fly, right?

187
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:42,608
Everything above-ground
is a diversion.

188
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:44,067
We'll infiltrate their
main base through

189
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,525
the sewers and bring
down the boss-man.

190
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:49,983
This way.

191
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:51,317
[REIGEN]
Once they lose their leader,

192
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,525
none of the rest
of them should pose

193
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:54,442
any threat on their own.

194
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:00,108
[OTSUKI grunts]

195
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,442
[MINEGISHI]
That's no ordinary paper fan.

196
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:07,900
It's been turned into a device
that amplifies shock waves.

197
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:12,775
Quick! Everybody get
behind my shield!

198
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:14,733
[MINEGISHI]
He disassembled then reassembled

199
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:16,733
the shredded vines and leaves.

200
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:18,233
[MINEGISHI]
Interesting technique.

201
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:19,942
I can even make
a human-like doll

202
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:21,608
out of a refrigerator
as long as it has

203
00:09:21,692 --> 00:09:23,650
the right parts and materials.

204
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:25,108
You feeling all right?

205
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:26,608
Better now, thanks.

206
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:29,192
[MINEGISHI] The one in the
green is a rare healing type.

207
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:31,108
They're perfectly
balanced in attack,

208
00:09:31,192 --> 00:09:33,358
defense, and support.

209
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:35,275
That means it's time
for me to step up

210
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:36,942
and get serious.

211
00:09:39,608 --> 00:09:41,775
Is this really the best
place for you to be?

212
00:09:41,858 --> 00:09:43,650
What the hell could
I do out there?

213
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:44,983
Besides, when Mob wakes up,

214
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,983
it'll probably help if
he has someone familiar

215
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:49,775
here to explain
the situation to him.

216
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:51,733
But damn, is that kid
knocked out or what?

217
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:53,650
He's sleeping like
he's half dead.

218
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:56,858
I think this goes way
beyond just being tired.

219
00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:58,733
Master Reigen! There's trouble!

220
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:01,442
Our security system
picked up some intruders!

221
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:02,900
[REIGEN]
Are you serious?!

222
00:10:02,983 --> 00:10:04,233
[REIGEN]
It's gotta be Claw.

223
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:06,233
But how'd they find this place?

224
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:08,025
[MITSUURA] Come on!
The rear exit's this way!

225
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,983
[REIGEN] No, it's no good
to run off without a plan.

226
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,317
We need to hide!

227
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:24,775
[CRAW MEMBER 10A]
No doubt about it.

228
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,525
They've gotta be in there.

229
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:30,150
[CRAW MEMBER 10B] So are you
guys shaking in your boots, yet?

230
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:32,733
[CRAW MEMBER 10C]
Get your asses out here!

231
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:34,150
[DIMPLE]
What's the plan, Reigen?

232
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,608
Want me to possess you
so you can brawl with 'em?

233
00:10:36,692 --> 00:10:37,900
[CRAW MEMBER 10A]
I'll open the door.

234
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:39,817
Stay on your guard, everyone.

235
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:47,192
[REIGEN] All right.
You got me. I give up.

236
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:48,442
I'm not an esper.

237
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:50,983
You can tell with your
tracing powers, right?

238
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,317
The kid on my back
actually is one,

239
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,733
but he hasn't been awake
since last night.

240
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:57,650
Let me just take him
to the hospital.

241
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,025
Seems fishy to me.

242
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:01,483
You think maybe he's
packin' a weapon?

243
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:04,358
Go frisk him and find out.

244
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:06,317
I don't have any
weapons on me, okay?

245
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,233
Only my phone
and a handkerchief.

246
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:10,442
He's got something
in his jacket pocket.

247
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:11,983
Oh, that. It's
just some cologne.

248
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,900
I work in the
fragrance industry.

249
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:15,400
Smells great, huh?

250
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:19,608
[CRAW MEMBERS groan]

251
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:22,025
[DIMPLE]
Ooh...

252
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:23,608
Apparently, it's
filled with a curse

253
00:11:23,692 --> 00:11:26,358
that causes extreme drowsiness.

254
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:29,233
I grabbed it from
four-eyes a while back.

255
00:11:29,317 --> 00:11:32,067
Good thing, too. It
really saved our butts.

256
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,067
Ah--

257
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,108
[SHIBATA]
Thought you were a joke,

258
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:35,608
but you're really not so bad.

259
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:36,817
Unfortunately for you,

260
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,692
you're gonna have
to deal with me next.

261
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:40,150
[REIGEN]
He's a big boy!

262
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,608
Are you ready?

263
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:45,317
[SHIBATA grunts]

264
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:49,233
[REIGEN] He's strong. But
thankfully, he's also an idiot.

265
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:51,150
I can't believe this
ridiculous lucky streak

266
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:52,692
you're on lately.

267
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:54,900
You're gonna die
a horrible death.

268
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:08,692
[BOSS] What a beautiful
sight to behold.

269
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:10,483
All that destruction...

270
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:13,608
...and yet I don't feel the
slightest tinge of remorse.

271
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,525
Sacrifices must be made
for world domination.

272
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:18,192
[SERIZAWA]
Is that really true?

273
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:21,483
[BOSS]
Serizawa. Why the long face?

274
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:23,358
Let me give you
a word of advice.

275
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,358
Oh, yes, President!
I would love to hear it!

276
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:29,733
The secret behind my
unflinching positive attitude...

277
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,817
...is that I've never
once concerned myself

278
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,150
with how others feel.

279
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:37,358
I've lived each day of my
life the way I wanted to.

280
00:12:37,442 --> 00:12:39,025
As long as I can
depend on myself,

281
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:41,650
everything will always work out.

282
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,483
Even if I lose all
of you, I doubt

283
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:45,900
it would do anything
to break my spirit.

284
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:48,275
I've decided to
take over the world,

285
00:12:48,358 --> 00:12:50,400
so that's what's
going to happen.

286
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:52,483
Since I have the
audacity to say that,

287
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:55,108
it's basically in
my hands already.

288
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,108
I'm sure you know
this, Serizawa,

289
00:12:57,192 --> 00:13:00,525
but I think very highly
of your potential.

290
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:03,483
You held back on
Joseph, didn't you?

291
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:06,900
You need to obtain a
calm and bold positivity.

292
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:09,442
Then you can be just
like me: unstoppable.

293
00:13:09,525 --> 00:13:10,608
I see!

294
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:13,025
That's how to climb
a corporate ladder?

295
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:15,900
[SHIMAZAKI] His misunderstanding
has gotten even worse.

296
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:18,900
I mean, this isn't
even a company.

297
00:13:21,358 --> 00:13:23,608
What'll we do now?
They found our hideout!

298
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:26,192
First, we'll grab a taxi
and get outta here.

299
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:29,025
--[SHIBATA growls]
--[DIMPLE] Look out!

Huh? What the hell?!
I thought you were out cold!

301
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,525
I was! But too bad for you,

302

'cause I'm wide
awake now, dumbass!

Ah! That's awesome!

Look, I seriously
give up this time.

I'm a lover, not a fighter...

Psycho Steroid!

309
00:13:50,108 --> 00:13:52,317
I send psychic
signals to my muscles

310
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,025
and adjust them for maximum--

pissed him off.

more powered up!

00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:42,358
No way!

477
00:21:42,442 --> 00:21:44,108
What now, Captain?
What do we do?!

478
00:21:44,192 --> 00:21:47,275
I don't know why, but
I can't raise my arms.

479
00:21:47,358 --> 00:21:49,608
So much for trying
that a second time.

480
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:52,317
[ONIGAWARA]
Here he comes!

481
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,817
[GODA]
Kageyama!

482
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,400
[MOB]
The Body Improvement Club?

483
00:22:02,483 --> 00:22:04,900
Oh. What happened?

484
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:07,692
Guess I was sleeping.
That was weird.

485
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:13,608
Be careful sleeping
outside. Not a good idea.

486
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:15,525
[MOB]
Sorry about that.

487
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:20,900
[MOB] What happened, Dimple?
Tell me everything.

488
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,525
[SHO]
Looks like we finally made it.

489
00:22:27,608 --> 00:22:30,858
I'm coming for you,
Dad. Get ready.

490
00:24:04,358 --> 00:24:05,400
[REIGEN]
After waking up, Mob heads

491
00:24:05,483 --> 00:24:06,942
for Seasoning Cultural Tower.

492
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:09,483
There, he goes up against
Minegishi from the Ultimate 5!

493
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:11,858
Leave the strongest of those
guys, Shimazaki, to me!

494
00:24:11,942 --> 00:24:14,317
Next time on <i>Mob Psycho</i>
<i>100 II</i> , episode 11:

495
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,942
"Guidance ~Psychic Sensor~."

496
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:18,608
Option B involves buying
the Blu-rays and the manga.
