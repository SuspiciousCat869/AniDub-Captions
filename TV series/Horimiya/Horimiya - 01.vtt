00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:16.808 position:50% align:center
[YASUDA] Right,
That's all for today's class.

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:20.979 position:50% align:center
Remember, college
entrance exams are next year.

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:23.898 position:50% align:center
So studying will eat up
most of your summer break.

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:25.567 position:50% align:center
I encourage you to go out
and enjoy the pool

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.528 position:50% align:center
or the beach
while you still can.

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.406 position:50% align:center
In fact, I'd be happy
to come with you.

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.782 position:50% align:center
What?

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.368 position:50% align:center
Why the hell would we invite
a teacher to tag along?

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.537 position:50% align:center
Don't be dense, Ishikawa!

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.747 position:50% align:center
If there are swimsuits involved,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.207 position:50% align:center
you're gonna need
adult supervision!

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:42.042 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA gasps]

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.169 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah, that makes sense.

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
Their stupidity is baffling.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.761 position:50% align:center
Yasuda would be a certified
hottie--if he didn't talk.

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center
[TAKAKO] Maybe, but at least
he's a good teacher.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.640 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Just ignore
the dumb things he says.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:02.395 position:50% align:center
Hori. Did something happen
between the two of you?

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.064 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
This morning...

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.984 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hori. Keep your chin up.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.778 position:50% align:center
Okay? Random.

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:13.281 position:50% align:center
Not random if you knew how much
I love flat-chested girls.

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:15.867 position:50% align:center
Flat-chested girls are A-Okay!

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.911 position:50% align:center
[HORI] He thought
that would cheer me up.

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:20.663 position:50% align:center
Wow. Just what
goes on in his head?

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.540 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Oh, yeah! So, Hori.

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:23.750 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Hmn?

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:25.251 position:50% align:center
This guy from another
school was asking me

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.754 position:50% align:center
for your phone number
the other day.

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:29.464 position:50% align:center
Can I give it to him?

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:31.341 position:50% align:center
[HORI] He didn't have
the guts to ask me himself,

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:33.259 position:50% align:center
so thanks but no thanks.

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:35.303 position:50% align:center
Aww. What, again?

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:37.764 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Yo!
Who's up for some bad singing?

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:39.099 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Like, today?

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.434 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Since these
coupons expire today, yeah.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.728 position:50% align:center
Half off two hours?
What a steal!

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:46.147 position:50% align:center
You wanna go. Come on!

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:47.649 position:50% align:center
It'll be fun!

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:51.236 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Uh. I think I'm gonna pass.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.405 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Hori! You always pass!

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:55.740 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
I know. I'm sorry!

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.035 position:50% align:center
Excuse me.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.121 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.748 position:50% align:center
Here ya go. You dropped this.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:06.167 position:50% align:center
Thanks. I didn't notice.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.380 position:50% align:center
He sounded so depressed.

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:12.382 position:50% align:center
Then again,
that's kinda his thing.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:15.218 position:50% align:center
[TAKAKO]
I bet he's a total otaku.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.763 position:50% align:center
This angle's def my favorite!

00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:20.140 position:50% align:center
Like into <i>moe</i> ?

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:22.809 position:50% align:center
A hundred percent! He has to be!

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:25.103 position:50% align:center
Does your nerd alert
pick up anything?

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:26.187 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Hmm...

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:28.982 position:50% align:center
That dude's one
giant mystery to me.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:31.151 position:50% align:center
I don't even know
if Miyamura has friends.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:32.027 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.154 position:50% align:center
Sorry! Gotta run!

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.698 position:50% align:center
And there she goes.

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.492 position:50% align:center
It feels like
she hurries home every day.

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:41.077 position:50% align:center
Must be a boyfriend
or something.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.662 position:50% align:center
You serious?

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:45.415 position:50% align:center
Well, she's way popular.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.167 position:50% align:center
It's not that surprising.

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:53.256 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:01.097 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.474 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Hey, Mom.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Got it. I'll handle dinner.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.400 position:50% align:center
Overtime sucks, I know. Bye.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.029 position:50% align:center
I should probably get going.

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.114 position:50% align:center
Sota!

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.949 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sissy!

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.659 position:50% align:center
We've been waiting for you.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A laughs]
Ugh. I know!

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.084 position:50% align:center
Let's hit up that store
we saw in that magazine

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.585 position:50% align:center
while we're here.

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT C]
Wait, right now?

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:32.879 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B]
Why not?

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:34.089 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Yeah, why not?

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:35.340 position:50% align:center
[HORI] I'm thinkin'
hamburgers for dinner.

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:36.925 position:50% align:center
[SOTA]
Yummy!

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:13.605 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Overtime and
working on her day off.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50% align:center
[HORI] I swear.
She's too nice for her own good.

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.612 position:50% align:center
I wish she'd learn how
to say no to people.

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50% align:center
[SOTA]
Sissy!

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:24.449 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Yeah?

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:28.661 position:50% align:center
[gassp]

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:32.665 position:50% align:center
Sota! What happened
to your little nose?

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.125 position:50% align:center
[SOTA]
I fell down.

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:37.045 position:50% align:center
Aww. Where's your
handkerchief, buddy?

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:38.546 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
So. Uh...

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:42.717 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go since
you've got it taken care of.

I didn't even see him there!

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.596 position:50% align:center
Um. Sorry.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.556 position:50% align:center
Hope he didn't cause
you too much trouble.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] It's fine.
Anyway, I'll see ya later.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:54.771 position:50% align:center
Sota.

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:56.481 position:50% align:center
Uh. You good?

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:57.565 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
You know...

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
If you're not
in any sort of hurry,

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:00.777 position:50% align:center
you're more than welcome
to stay for a while.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.697 position:50% align:center
Oh. I dunno. You sure?

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.615 position:50% align:center
This'll be my way
of saying thanks.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
So, yeah!

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] He fell down
'cause this dog spooked him.

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:12.330 position:50% align:center
I appreciate you
helping him out.

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] And I appreciate
you for treating me.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
[SOTA]
Um, hey, Bro.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.919 position:50% align:center
Why do you drink coffee
if it tastes so gross?

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:20.463 position:50% align:center
I ask myself the same thing.

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:21.881 position:50% align:center
Your brother's a good kid.

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
He introduced himself
and everything.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50% align:center
Thanks.
That's nice of you to say.

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:28.263 position:50% align:center
He's a real handful
most of the time.

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:29.639 position:50% align:center
Although, taking care of him

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.058 position:50% align:center
and all the housework
is what's really impressive.

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:33.435 position:50% align:center
Never would've guessed, Hori.

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:35.103 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:36.146 position:50% align:center
Hm?!

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.313 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:38.732 position:50% align:center
I mean you are Hori, right?

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:39.774 position:50% align:center
From Class One?

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.901 position:50% align:center
Well, I mean, I am, but...

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:43.069 position:50% align:center
...how'd you know that?

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.947 position:50% align:center
Do... Do you go to
the same school as me?

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:47.032 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
What?

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.450 position:50% align:center
Are you being
serious right now?

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:51.202 position:50% align:center
I'm Miyamura, and
we're in the same class.

[HORI]
Huh? Wait. Whaaaaat?!

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
That can't be the same person.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.965 position:50% align:center
If they are, the world
doesn't make sense anymore

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:05.425 position:50% align:center
You're making one
of the weirdest faces

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
in the history of weird faces.

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:08.386 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.929 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Nothing's up.

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:11.639 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Are you sure?

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.645 position:50% align:center
Where're you going? Hori!

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:19.606 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Miyamura. Got a sec?

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:20.732 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:22.984 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
What?

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:24.944 position:50% align:center
You're asking me to
come over to your house again?

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:26.321 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
I'm not asking for me,

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:28.323 position:50% align:center
I'm asking for my
little brother, Sota.

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:29.991 position:50% align:center
He wants "that cool dude
that saved him from the dog"

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:31.993 position:50% align:center
to come play a while.

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center
Then I'll pick up a picture book
for him or something.

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:36.456 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.667 position:50% align:center
Just showing up will
be enough, trust me.

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:40.960 position:50% align:center
What a relief!

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
Now I don't have
to break Sota's heart.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.466 position:50% align:center
I'm kinda shocked.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.385 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
By what?

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.720 position:50% align:center
By the fact that you sought
me out and are talking to me.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.389 position:50% align:center
After yesterday 'n' all.

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:55.642 position:50% align:center
Well, you know, I thought
for sure you'd avoid me.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:58.436 position:50% align:center
You really think
I'd react that way?

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.563 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna lie
and say it wasn't awkward

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
because we both know it was.

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:05.402 position:50% align:center
It freaked me out to see
such a different side of you.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.320 position:50% align:center
But I'm different out
of school, too.

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:10.448 position:50% align:center
So that'd be a pretty silly
reason to straight up avoid yo--

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.618 position:50% align:center
Why are you blushing?

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:16.663 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] I'm, uh, just not
used to hearing stuff like this.

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.374 position:50% align:center
It feels kinda strange, is all.

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:21.376 position:50% align:center
Still, thank you

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
What's with the look?

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.881 position:50% align:center
I just noticed how nice
your smile is.

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:27.966 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:29.217 position:50% align:center
You should wear
your hair up more often.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.844 position:50% align:center
Maybe lose the glasses, too.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:32.178 position:50% align:center
Dontcha think?

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:35.515 position:50% align:center
But then they'd see all
the piercings that I have.

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:36.975 position:50% align:center
You do have quite a few.

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:38.810 position:50% align:center
So what's the grand total?

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:40.020 position:50% align:center
It's up to nine.

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.522 position:50% align:center
Four on each ear along
with the one on my lip.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.566 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
That is way too many.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:46.526 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
My mom would agree with you.

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:49.863 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Here're some things
I've learned about Miyamura

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:52.032 position:50% align:center
since he started coming over.

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:54.868 position:50% align:center
I like manga, but I'm not
into that <i>moe</i> nonsense.

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:56.661 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
He is not an otaku.

00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:58.913 position:50% align:center
Brought some cake for you guys!

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:00.999 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
His family runs a cake shop.

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:02.334 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
That little hole hurt
like you wouldn't believe!

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50% align:center
[HORI] He pierced
himself with a safety pin

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:08.757 position:50% align:center
back in middle school.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.467 position:50% align:center
Also...

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
Oof.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:15.722 position:50% align:center
...he's not a very good student.

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.182 position:50% align:center
Unbelievable, Hori!

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
You're like a straight-A queen!

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
I'm really not.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:23.521 position:50% align:center
What's incredible is how a quiet
guy with glasses isn't smart.

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:25.440 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Is that the rule?

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.234 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
It's times like these

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:29.736 position:50% align:center
when I realize my
initial impression of him

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:33.198 position:50% align:center
couldn't have been further
from the person he actually is.

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.075 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
That a supermarket ad you got?

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:38.370 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Yeah.
Eggs are on sale tomorrow, so...

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:43.458 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Wow. His bottom
eyelashes are really long.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
What's wrong?

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:47.462 position:50% align:center
Oh! [clears throat]

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.464 position:50% align:center
It's just there's
a sale on eggs tomorrow

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:50.799 position:50% align:center
with no purchase limit.

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:53.760 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] But it says
it only lasts till four PM.

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:54.844 position:50% align:center
I've got this!

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:56.888 position:50% align:center
Nothing's gonna stand in my way!

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:59.683 position:50% align:center
Unless there's a committee
meeting but what are the odds?

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.144 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN]
All committee members,

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:04.896 position:50% align:center
please report to the AV room.

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.940 position:50% align:center
You're being called
for an emergency meeting.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:09.776 position:50% align:center
[HORI] I guess
the odds are pretty good.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:13.238 position:50% align:center
But... I'm not giving up
on those eggs.

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:14.322 position:50% align:center
I refuse!

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
W-Where's the fire, Hori?

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:22.997 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
She's leaving it up to meeee?!

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.838 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Can't believe
I'm running--in this heat!

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
Twenty minutes to go!

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.925 position:50% align:center
I know a shortcut!

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50% align:center
Egg time! I gotta go!

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:55.947 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Huh?

00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:57.615 position:50% align:center
What the heck?

00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:00.952 position:50% align:center
Wait. What's egg time?

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:03.955 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Man, I owe you one!

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:07.500 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Ugh.
Rabid housewives everywhere.

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:10.754 position:50% align:center
I never wanna see another
sale as long as I live.

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:13.631 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot.

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:17.927 position:50% align:center
I, uh, kinda sorta ran
into somebody on my way there.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.388 position:50% align:center
Kinda? Sorta? Who was it?

00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:23.141 position:50% align:center
That Yuki girl
you hang out with.

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:25.101 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Oh.

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:28.104 position:50% align:center
And she saw you
looking like this?

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Pretty sure she didn't
recognize me, though. Surprise.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.068 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Uh-huh.

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:36.529 position:50% align:center
It's time to dig in!

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.073 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Be careful not to spill.

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:40.200 position:50% align:center
[SOTA]
Okay.

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:43.119 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Miyamura,
I can't explain exactly why,

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:45.747 position:50% align:center
but I don't want anybody
else to see you this way.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
Pretty selfish, huh?

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Sorry! What am I saying?

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:56.383 position:50% align:center
Forget it.
I'll get us some drinks.

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:58.259 position:50% align:center
Is barley tea okay?

00:11:58.343 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
Go ahead 'n' eat.

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:01.262 position:50% align:center
It's yummier hot.

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:05.350 position:50% align:center
You know what? Um...

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50% align:center
Me, too.

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:08.144 position:50% align:center
I like seeing you
outside of school:

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:09.813 position:50% align:center
cooking dinner, getting mad,

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:13.274 position:50% align:center
and yelling so everyone
within a five-mile radius hears.

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:14.984 position:50% align:center
I even like the fact
that you don't worry

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:16.486 position:50% align:center
about your appearance at home.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.697 position:50% align:center
And how you could
probably suplex a truck.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.906 position:50% align:center
I get the picture!

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:21.449 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
All I'm saying is,

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:23.993 position:50% align:center
I don't want anyone else
to see this side of you either.

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
[HORI] And no one will,
if I can help it.

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.039 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
It's nice.

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:31.209 position:50% align:center
It feels as if these moments
are mine and mine alone.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Ugh!

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:37.882 position:50% align:center
I told you to stop
talking ten seconds ago!

00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:41.011 position:50% align:center
Can I have some too, please?

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:42.637 position:50% align:center
You're the best!

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:46.516 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Jeez! How can he spout off

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:49.185 position:50% align:center
about such cringey stuff
with a straight face?

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.771 position:50% align:center
I know his grades suck,
but is he an idiot?

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:53.148 position:50% align:center
You dummy.

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
You're worse than a dummy.

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:58.570 position:50% align:center
You're like a dummy king.
King of the dummies.

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:00.113 position:50% align:center
If she says the word "dummy,"

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:02.282 position:50% align:center
she'll say it at least
a hundred more times.

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:03.324 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Are you joking?

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:06.369 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy...

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.079 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
I guess she does.

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:10.665 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
What's so funny?

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:14.127 position:50% align:center
Everyone has a side that they
prefer to keep to themselves.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
Listen, Hori,

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center
it's not that I don't like
the way you are at school.

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
I just like this plainer
and angrier version better.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:24.179 position:50% align:center
I think it's a much
cuter version of you.

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:25.680 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Somehow, the two of us wound up

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:31.061 position:50% align:center
sharing our "secret selves"
with one another.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
Whatever, King Dummy.

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:38.568 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA sighs] It's only
gonna get hotter, isn't it?

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.153 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Yep.

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:43.198 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Wearing this jacket
all the time's gonna be torture.

00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:45.533 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Yeah, but it
could be worse y'know.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:48.495 position:50% align:center
I'm screwed! Mega screwed!

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:50.205 position:50% align:center
We're gonna be swimming in P.E!

00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:51.623 position:50% align:center
What should I do?

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:53.583 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
You should suck it up and swim.

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:55.001 position:50% align:center
It's better than
running a marathon,

00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:56.795 position:50% align:center
especially when it's scorching.

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:58.505 position:50% align:center
Swimming is way worse!

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
It means they're
gonna see everything!

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center
What are you talking abou--

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:03.176 position:50% align:center
[inhales]

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.428 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
I'm talking about these!

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:12.060 position:50% align:center
[HORI] There's fine line
between being bold and stupid.

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:15.814 position:50% align:center
Sometimes I'm not
sure where you land.

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:18.441 position:50% align:center
At least swimming wound up
being optional, huh?

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:20.610 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Yeah. For real.

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:22.612 position:50% align:center
But if we have to run
a marathon like you said,

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:25.699 position:50% align:center
I'll probably die of heatstroke
because of this stupid jacket!

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:28.576 position:50% align:center
[HORI] I don't actually think
they'll make us do that, though.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.912 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Knowing my luck, we will!

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
Wow. I never pictured
those two spending

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:35.166 position:50% align:center
so much time together.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.252 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Understatement of the year.

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:38.461 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT D]
Yo, Hori!

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.338 position:50% align:center
You mind if I borrow your notes?

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:42.132 position:50% align:center
[TAKAKO]
Ooh! Me, too! Me, too!

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center
Fine.

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.176 position:50% align:center
But you guys need
to start taking your own.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT D]
I know, I know.

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:49.848 position:50% align:center
Thanks a bunch
for this time, though!

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:52.058 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
She's popular.

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:55.645 position:50% align:center
Who? You mean Hori?

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:57.230 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:59.357 position:50% align:center
Ah. Yeah.

00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:01.818 position:50% align:center
I think that tends to happen
when you have good grades.

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:02.986 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Let's cut to the chase.

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:05.363 position:50% align:center
The chase? Um. What chase?

00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:08.324 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] You and Hori
are tight these days.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:09.868 position:50% align:center
Are you two a thing?

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:14.664 position:50% align:center
No! What gave you that idea?
[chuckles nervously]

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:16.499 position:50% align:center
I thought as much.

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:19.836 position:50% align:center
I mean, you don't exactly
have a lot in common.

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.672 position:50% align:center
Yeah. True. Very true!

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:24.716 position:50% align:center
We wouldn't make a
good match in the slightest.

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:28.887 position:50% align:center
Ah. We'd be...
Um... Uh... Well...

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Use your words, dude!

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:32.307 position:50% align:center
Don't see them together often.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.642 position:50% align:center
Come on. Let's get going.

00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:37.812 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. Oh.

00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:38.772 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:39.898 position:50% align:center
I get it now.

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:42.192 position:50% align:center
Bet you have a
crush on Hori, huh?

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.693 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:46.988 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so what if I do?

00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:49.491 position:50% align:center
Oh! I thought you
were gonna say no!

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:51.785 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:53.536 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] But that explains
why you're always glaring at me

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.829 position:50% align:center
when I'm talking to her!

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:56.623 position:50% align:center
Well, now you know!

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
Good for you!

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.876 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
I'm so sorry, Ishikawa.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.252 position:50% align:center
I would've been more considerate

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:02.837 position:50% align:center
had I known
how much you like Hori!

00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:04.339 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Announce it to the
whole school, why don't you?!

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:05.548 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Ah, my bad!

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:06.341 position:50% align:center
I guess I didn't realize
it's still a secret.

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:07.967 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
Hmm?

00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
Hey! What're you
two slackers doing?

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.846 position:50% align:center
P.E.'s about to start!

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.139 position:50% align:center
[gasp]

00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:15.600 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
We're already gonna be late,

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:18.395 position:50% align:center
so we might as well
take our time.

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:19.604 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,

00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:21.106 position:50% align:center
now that we're getting
to know each other,

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:23.608 position:50% align:center
why do you wear your winter
uniform in the summer?

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
Don't you get hot?

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:27.696 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Um. Actually, I get cold?

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:29.364 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
You're sweating buckets, man.

00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:31.658 position:50% align:center
Look, what I'm about to tell you

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.576 position:50% align:center
might sound a little
on the strange side.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.245 position:50% align:center
Keep an open mind if you can.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:37.789 position:50% align:center
Hori is the only person who's
seen me without a shirt on!

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:39.958 position:50% align:center
Really? But why?

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:41.626 position:50% align:center
So, if I show you,

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.004 position:50% align:center
you have to promise
you won't tell our teachers.

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:45.880 position:50% align:center
The last thing I am is a snitch!

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:47.799 position:50% align:center
It'd be a real pain
if they found out.

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:52.262 position:50% align:center
But I feel like
I can trust you. Ta-da.

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:53.471 position:50% align:center
Are those things real?

00:16:53.555 --> 00:16:54.597 position:50% align:center
You're only a teenager,

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:56.224 position:50% align:center
and you've gotten
that much ink done?

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:57.350 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Yeah.

00:16:57.434 --> 00:16:59.269 position:50% align:center
Short sleeves would
present a problem.

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:00.895 position:50% align:center
That design's
pretty sick, though.

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:02.856 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Now you know.

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Holy shit.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:05.942 position:50% align:center
I totally had
you pinned for the weird,

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:07.444 position:50% align:center
gloomy, otaku type.

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.529 position:50% align:center
But you're full of
surprises, aren't you?

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:10.739 position:50% align:center
Otaku type, no.

00:17:10.822 --> 00:17:13.867 position:50% align:center
But everything else
describes me to a tee.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.660 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Now that
I'm getting a good look.

00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:17.454 position:50% align:center
He's kinda handsome.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:18.872 position:50% align:center
His hair still sucks, though.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:21.124 position:50% align:center
So, is P.E. in the gym today?

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.960 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Is this the kind
of face Hori's attracted to?

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:25.628 position:50% align:center
That's my head.

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:26.755 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:28.381 position:50% align:center
You have a crap-ton
of piercings, too!

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:33.011 position:50% align:center
[GYM TEACHER]
Okay, next!

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:35.180 position:50% align:center
You're one strange dude,
you know that?

00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:36.389 position:50% align:center
Why get inked or pierced

00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:38.641 position:50% align:center
if you're just gonna
end up hiding it all?

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:40.518 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Uh...

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:43.146 position:50% align:center
Have you ever done something
completely on impulse?

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:44.647 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Not those things.

00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:47.108 position:50% align:center
Your secret's safe with me,

00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:49.277 position:50% align:center
though one thing
I still wanna know is

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:53.239 position:50% align:center
how you and Hori magically
became besties overnight.

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:57.202 position:50% align:center
It wasn't magic.

00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:59.829 position:50% align:center
It actually started
a while back.

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
Although, the vibe I get is
she's just being nice to me.

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:04.334 position:50% align:center
We're only friends,

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:06.961 position:50% align:center
so there's nothing
for you to worry about.

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:11.424 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Cool. So you
won't mind if I ask her out?

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
C'mon, man.

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
You don't need my permission
for something like that.

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Guess not. Just felt right.

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:18.890 position:50% align:center
That ball's in Hori's court.

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center
It's not my place.

00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:29.984 position:50% align:center
You skipped P.E. Slacker!

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
And you had gym duty, too,

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.363 position:50% align:center
so guess who got stuck
cleaning up your mess?

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:34.197 position:50% align:center
Me!

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
I said I'm sorry!

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:36.491 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Sorry doesn't cut it!

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.034 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Whaddaya want from me then?

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:39.619 position:50% align:center
You were hanging out with Toru?

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:41.079 position:50% align:center
Look at you makin' friends.

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:44.124 position:50% align:center
Not really.
We were just talking.

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
Okay. What's with
the cold shoulder?

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
Uh. What cold shoulder?

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.881 position:50% align:center
The one you're giving
me as we speak.

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:53.383 position:50% align:center
I'm actually hot, not cold.

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:55.301 position:50% align:center
Did I accidentally
offend you somehow?

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:57.387 position:50% align:center
Will you please just get off
my back and my shoulders?

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
Hori!

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:02.600 position:50% align:center
I need to talk
to you. Privately.

00:19:02.684 --> 00:19:03.727 position:50% align:center
I'll find you after school.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.688 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Well, I...

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:09.107 position:50% align:center
--Hold on! Wait!
--[MIYAMURA] No worries.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.525 position:50% align:center
I can pick up Sota for you.

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:11.985 position:50% align:center
You see what he has to say.

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:14.112 position:50% align:center
It sounds like it
might be important.

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:16.948 position:50% align:center
But...

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:26.374 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:38.345 position:50% align:center
Huh? Sissy's home!

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.974 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] If the
two of them wind up dating,

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:44.726 position:50% align:center
I'll be a giant third wheel.

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:46.186 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Sorry I'm late, Sota!

00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:48.646 position:50% align:center
I'll get dinner
started in a little bit.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.815 position:50% align:center
[SOTA]
'Kay! Sounds good!

00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:55.570 position:50% align:center
Welcome home.

00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:58.615 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
We need to talk.

00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:00.909 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] If she says
I have to stop coming over,

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:02.827 position:50% align:center
then that's that.

00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:04.245 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
I spoke with Toru.

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:06.081 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Oh. Hmm.

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:08.291 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
He told me

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:10.585 position:50% align:center
you don't think you
and I'd make a good match!

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:12.253 position:50% align:center
Huh? What?

00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:13.963 position:50% align:center
Now, I know what
you really think.

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:16.299 position:50% align:center
All of this is
just me being nice?

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center
That's the kind
of "vibe" you get?

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:20.887 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Wait. Didn't he
tell you something else?

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.140 position:50% align:center
[HORI] We're talking about
you and me right now, not him!

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:25.850 position:50% align:center
So you said that?

00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:27.811 position:50% align:center
Admit it to my face!

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.192 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I did.

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:36.611 position:50% align:center
So... you've been
thinking this all along.

00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:39.572 position:50% align:center
Every single second of
every single day you came here.

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:42.534 position:50% align:center
No! It's just...

00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:44.327 position:50% align:center
I'm boring and depressing.

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center
I put the most emo
emo-kid to shame.

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:48.206 position:50% align:center
How could I not
be bothering you?

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:51.584 position:50% align:center
Or ruining your rep just
by being around you!

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:52.669 position:50% align:center
You invite me here.

00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:55.296 position:50% align:center
But some days
I don't understand why.

00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
Aw, Hori! Don't cry!

00:20:58.508 --> 00:21:01.094 position:50% align:center
[HORI cries]
Why? You idiot.

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:05.265 position:50% align:center
Why should you have to
worry about my "reputation"?

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:07.767 position:50% align:center
Don't assume stuff
without even asking!

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:10.353 position:50% align:center
You better not say things
like that ever again.

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:11.604 position:50% align:center
Dummy!

00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:14.357 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Really. I am.

00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:19.446 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Just thinking about
what you said makes me so mad!

00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:21.781 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Um. Let's take a breather!

00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:24.701 position:50% align:center

coming to my house,

--who would be around to

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:28.329 position:50% align:center
wake me up when I fall
asleep watching movies?

Who'd eat your
portion of dinner?

00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:31.374 position:50% align:center
Hori.

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:33.251 position:50% align:center
[HORI] I'd have
a fridge full of leftovers!

00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:36.546 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA screams]

00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:40.842 position:50% align:center
Toru? He asked,
but I turned him down.

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
Really? But he seems
like a genuinely sweet guy.

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:46.181 position:50% align:center
Um. What? Did you
just call another guy "sweet"?

00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:48.308 position:50% align:center
Toru might not be the
only one with a crush.

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:49.851 position:50% align:center
Why not ask him out?

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
No thanks.

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:53.730 position:50% align:center
I don't think we'd get very far
as a couple in the long run.

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:55.065 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:23:29.492 --> 00:23:32.495 position:50% align:center
Morning. I think.

00:23:32.579 --> 00:23:36.791 position:50% align:center
So, uh, I did the
thing yesterday.

00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:37.917 position:50% align:center
[shrieks]

00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:39.627 position:50% align:center
You don't have
to say anything out loud!

00:23:39.711 --> 00:23:41.046 position:50% align:center
Just let it go!

00:23:41.129 --> 00:23:45.258 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA cries] You're such
a genuinely sweet guy!

00:23:45.342 --> 00:23:46.426 position:50% align:center
What gives?

00:23:46.509 --> 00:23:50.513 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe
he is asking him out.

00:23:50.597 --> 00:23:52.015 position:50% align:center
Who's asking who?
