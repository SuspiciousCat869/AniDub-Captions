00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.125 align:middle
Hey, Dad.
How long're you staying?

00:00:16.208 --> 00:00:17.500 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
Who's to say?

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:18.667 align:middle
You'll prob'ly be in tears

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.792 align:middle
the second I walk out
the door, wontcha?

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:21.958 align:middle
[SOTA]
I gotta pee!

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:24.083 align:middle
Go! Don't fall in!

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:27.167 align:middle
Actually, I've been wondering
the same thing.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.458 align:middle
How long are you staying, dear?

00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:31.917 align:middle
What's wrong?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.292 align:middle
Yuriko, am I not
welcome in my home?

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:38.833 align:middle
[YURIKO] I'm just curious
if your job is okay with you

00:00:38.917 --> 00:00:41.458 align:middle
being here for such an
extended period of time.

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:42.667 align:middle
[HORI]
I'm home.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.458 align:middle
Oh, and I brought
Miyamura along.

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:47.083 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
Whoa! Really?

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:48.333 align:middle
Nice to see you.

00:00:48.417 --> 00:00:49.750 align:middle
Ugh!

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:51.250 align:middle
Who the hell are you?

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.750 align:middle
What, you can't recognize
your best buddy

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:53.917 align:middle
in the whole wide world?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.667 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Um. So, uh...

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.083 align:middle
Thanks for having me.

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:02.208 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
I'll be damned! It is you!

00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:04.958 align:middle
Uh-huh. In the flesh.

00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:06.083 align:middle
Leave him alone.

00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:08.000 align:middle
It's too hot to be so close.

00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:09.292 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
No kidding.

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:10.708 align:middle
You could fill an
Olympic sized swimming pool

00:01:10.792 --> 00:01:12.125 align:middle
with all that sweat.

00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:14.125 align:middle
Yeah, I know.

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:16.083 align:middle
But it's a cold sweat.

00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle
I got an idea!

00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:18.167 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Sir?

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.042 align:middle
You and me should
take a bath together!

00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:21.833 align:middle
What'd you say?

00:01:21.917 --> 00:01:22.708 align:middle
[YURIKO]
Go on.

00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:24.500 align:middle
I already filled it up for you.

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:26.833 align:middle
There's plenty of
time before dinner.

00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:28.333 align:middle
Nah. I'm good.

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:29.667 align:middle
You don't like me?

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.708 align:middle
No! I think you're great!

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:33.125 align:middle
You do?

00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:35.208 align:middle
Sweet, then let's hop in!

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.042 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
Come on, Miyamura.

00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:39.625 align:middle
Aww. Don't be shy.

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:42.667 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Um, sir? One sec.

00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:45.875 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Please don't freak out!

00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.083 align:middle
I can explain everything!

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:49.625 align:middle
And, no! They're
not yakuza tattoos, I swear!

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:50.792 align:middle
[HORI]
Oh, right.

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:54.542 align:middle
[KYOSUKE] This is
probably a dumb question,

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:56.667 align:middle
but are these disposable?

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.542 align:middle
It took you the
whole meal to notice?

00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:01.458 align:middle
Took me until
I saw his match yours.

00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:05.333 align:middle
I'm so sorry.
Oh, it's getting late!

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:06.958 align:middle
I shouldn't overstay my welcome.

00:02:07.042 --> 00:02:07.833 align:middle
You're here now.

00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle
Just stay the night.

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:11.500 align:middle
What? Thank you,
but I shouldn't.

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:13.875 align:middle
[YURIKO] If we let Izumi
spend the night with us,

00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.167 align:middle
Kyosuke won't have a futon.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.250 align:middle
Seriously?

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:19.750 align:middle
So the boyfriend
gets priority over me?

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:21.375 align:middle
Are you really gonna stay?

00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:22.833 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I wouldn't want to impose.

00:02:22.917 --> 00:02:23.875 align:middle
You should!

00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.250 align:middle
I'm cool with you
sharing my room!

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:28.042 align:middle
No way. Miyamura's
sleeping with Daddy tonight.

00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:30.083 align:middle
Aww!

00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:34.417 align:middle
'Kay boys, goodnight!

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.542 align:middle
I know.

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:37.667 align:middle
Sucks sharing a room
with an old fart.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.833 align:middle
--No.
--Heh.

00:02:38.917 --> 00:02:41.292 align:middle
Bet you wish
you were in Kyoko's room.

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:45.083 align:middle
I'm perfectly fine
here really! Heh heh.

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:46.375 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
So tell me.

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:49.292 align:middle
What is it you like
about my daughter?

00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:54.708 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I like that...

00:02:54.792 --> 00:02:57.042 align:middle
...she doesn't judge people
based on their looks.

00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:59.083 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
Hmph.

00:03:01.917 --> 00:03:03.000 align:middle
Uh, sir?

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:03.958 align:middle
Did you hear me?

00:03:04.042 --> 00:03:06.583 align:middle
[snoring]

00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:08.042 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
He passed out!

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.042 align:middle
I barely slept a wink.

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:54.333 align:middle
[HORI]
Good morning.

00:04:54.417 --> 00:04:56.667 align:middle
Oh, hey. Same to you.

00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:05.167 align:middle
Those are her
middle school gym clothes.

00:05:06.292 --> 00:05:07.500 align:middle
[SOTA]
See ya later, alligator!

00:05:07.583 --> 00:05:08.417 align:middle
Be safe.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.875 align:middle
Have a lovely day!

00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.042 align:middle
You want me to walk you there?

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:13.708 align:middle
Follow and you're dead.

00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:15.000 align:middle
See you later!

00:05:15.083 --> 00:05:17.125 align:middle
Thank you for everything.

00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:18.625 align:middle
[YURIKO]
Not so fast.

00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:20.417 align:middle
Don't say "thanks"
when you leave.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.667 align:middle
Say, "See you later."

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.958 align:middle
[gasps]

00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:25.750 align:middle
I'll see ya later!

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:27.667 align:middle
[YURIKO]
I sure hope so.

00:05:32.292 --> 00:05:33.875 align:middle
That can't be right.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.458 align:middle
They just came out of
the same house together

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.917 align:middle
[STUDENT BB]
Holy shit! Hori from class one?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.625 align:middle
Dude, I thought she was single!

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle
[STUDENT CC]
Hori?

00:05:43.833 --> 00:05:45.333 align:middle
You've got an elective
with her, right?

00:05:45.417 --> 00:05:47.208 align:middle
She's way too good for him.

00:05:47.292 --> 00:05:49.125 align:middle
Beauty 'n' brains in one.

00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:50.542 align:middle
[STUDENT EE]
Yeah?

00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:53.042 align:middle
What's a grade A chick
like that doing with Miyamura?

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:54.417 align:middle
[STUDENT GG]
If she's goin' slummin',

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.875 align:middle
she might as well date me!

00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.250 align:middle
Have you heard?

00:05:57.333 --> 00:05:59.125 align:middle
Miyamura and Hori
are totes a thing!

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:00.250 align:middle
[STUDENT B]
You're joking!

00:06:00.333 --> 00:06:02.667 align:middle
She's with that emo-looking guy?

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.333 align:middle
What is wrong with her?

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:06.708 align:middle
Girl needs some standards!

00:06:06.792 --> 00:06:08.292 align:middle
[STUDENT A]
I know, right?

00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:11.917 align:middle
The whole damn school
is talking shit!

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.792 align:middle
And if you and I
are hearing it all,

00:06:13.875 --> 00:06:15.208 align:middle
you know they are, too.

00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:16.500 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA] Well, the assholes
are yapping about it

00:06:16.583 --> 00:06:17.958 align:middle
in the same room!

00:06:18.042 --> 00:06:20.333 align:middle
Even kids from other classes
are running their mouths!

00:06:20.417 --> 00:06:21.375 align:middle
Jerks!

00:06:21.458 --> 00:06:27.750 align:middle
And right when
he finally got there.

00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:29.167 align:middle
Wha...?

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.542 align:middle
I know it's a sucky situation,
but why're you crying?

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:34.417 align:middle
Hey. Calm down.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.458 align:middle
It'll be okay.

00:06:35.542 --> 00:06:36.833 align:middle
So, uh, Hori.

00:06:36.917 --> 00:06:39.417 align:middle
Are you and Miyamura
actually going out?

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.750 align:middle
Yes, what's it to you?

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:41.792 align:middle
No way!

00:06:41.875 --> 00:06:43.417 align:middle
Wow, I bet all
the guys you rejected

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.542 align:middle
are crying their
eyes out right now!

00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:47.458 align:middle
[HORI]
I didn't turn down that many.

00:06:47.542 --> 00:06:50.083 align:middle
[STUDENT II] Please,
you can drop the modesty act.

00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:52.333 align:middle
Don't pay any
attention to them.

00:06:52.417 --> 00:06:54.292 align:middle
They're chumps without a clue.

00:06:54.375 --> 00:06:55.875 align:middle
Try and stay positive!

00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.167 align:middle
You 'n' Hori both!

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.333 align:middle
Don't worry.

00:06:58.417 --> 00:07:00.833 align:middle
I'm not bothered
by what they say.

00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle
[STUDENT II]
Yo, Hori!

00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:10.917 align:middle
Where's the hubby to your wifey?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000 align:middle
I wish I knew.

00:07:13.083 --> 00:07:15.250 align:middle
[STUDENT HH]
Oh, shit. Is he skipping school?

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:16.292 align:middle
Ouchies!

00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:18.208 align:middle
Her "hubby'll"
be here after lunch.

00:07:18.292 --> 00:07:20.625 align:middle
[STUDENT HH]
Did you have to karate chop me?

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.417 align:middle
How ya doin'?

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.542 align:middle
[gasps]

00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle
What?!

00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:47.208 align:middle
[STUDENT B]
Hey, Miyamura.

00:07:47.292 --> 00:07:49.083 align:middle
Why'd you get a haircut?

00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:52.417 align:middle
Oh. 'Cause it's hot.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.125 align:middle
He's as hot as the weather!

00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:55.708 align:middle
For sure!

00:07:55.792 --> 00:07:58.208 align:middle
Then, what's with
the winter uniform?

00:07:58.292 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle
Uh. 'Cause I'm cold.

00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:02.625 align:middle
[STUDENT B] Your piercings
are the coolest things ever!

00:08:02.708 --> 00:08:03.958 align:middle
When'd you get them?

00:08:04.042 --> 00:08:05.417 align:middle
Middle school.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.208 align:middle
[STUDENT C] Ooo, and your
family runs a bakery, right?

00:08:08.292 --> 00:08:09.292 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Hoo boy.

00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:12.375 align:middle
The ice queen has
entered the chat.

00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:14.292 align:middle
Hey. I'm gettin' kinda chilly.

00:08:14.375 --> 00:08:16.167 align:middle
Yeah. Same here.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.208 align:middle
I don't see this
lasting too long.

00:08:18.292 --> 00:08:19.583 align:middle
Huh? See what?

00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:20.750 align:middle
I'm not sure what you mean.

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle
You guys! I'm freezing!

00:08:22.833 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle
Miyamura! Check this...!

00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:32.208 align:middle
[shrieks]

00:08:32.292 --> 00:08:33.708 align:middle
Jeez.

00:08:33.792 --> 00:08:36.458 align:middle
And the Academy Award for
the Best Reaction goes to Shu.

00:08:36.542 --> 00:08:38.333 align:middle
Oh, it's just you, Miyamura!

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:40.292 align:middle
Nice haircut, bro!

00:08:40.375 --> 00:08:42.167 align:middle
You changin'
the game for summer?

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.333 align:middle
Trying to.

00:08:43.417 --> 00:08:46.208 align:middle
'Tis the season for
switching things up.

00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:48.875 align:middle
Did that chick
just take a picture?

00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.208 align:middle
Here, I'll text it to ya!

00:08:50.292 --> 00:08:54.750 align:middle
Stalker. Like, whoa.
So, anyway...

00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:56.958 align:middle
Don't try to
outdo them, Hori!

00:08:57.042 --> 00:08:58.333 align:middle
Whoa!

00:08:58.417 --> 00:09:00.875 align:middle
Daddy! You gotta come see this!

00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.292 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Thanks for having me.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.958 align:middle
Hm?! And who the hell are you?

00:09:05.042 --> 00:09:06.042 align:middle
He's your bestest buddy

00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:07.792 align:middle
in the whole wide world
with a haircut.

00:09:07.875 --> 00:09:09.917 align:middle
Whoa! It's Miyamura?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.542 align:middle
Why the drastic change?

00:09:11.625 --> 00:09:13.583 align:middle
She dump ya? Poor guy.

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:15.375 align:middle
I wouldn't bring a
boy I dumped over!

00:09:15.458 --> 00:09:18.875 align:middle
[phone rings]

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:19.875 align:middle
Who's that?

00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle
Your side piece?

00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:23.167 align:middle
He's a friend from
middle school.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.167 align:middle
Hey. What's up?

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.500 align:middle
Candy?

00:09:30.542 --> 00:09:33.042 align:middle
[SHINDO]
Huh? Oh no, you don't.

00:09:36.833 --> 00:09:39.333 align:middle
Oh. Sorry we're late.

00:09:40.125 --> 00:09:41.792 align:middle
What're you doing?

00:09:42.708 --> 00:09:46.417 align:middle
Ahh... Ahh...

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.750 align:middle
[screams]

00:09:47.833 --> 00:09:49.417 align:middle
Ah!! Why are we screaming?!

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.458 align:middle
Miyamura? How could you?

00:09:52.542 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle
My sweet, beloved,
long-haired friend!

00:09:54.833 --> 00:09:57.625 align:middle
He's gone and left me forever!

00:09:57.708 --> 00:09:59.083 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I'm still right here.

00:09:59.167 --> 00:10:01.833 align:middle
He can grow it back whenever
he wants, so take it easy.

00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle
Whoa. That is
one big-ass bag of candy!

00:10:05.083 --> 00:10:07.750 align:middle
Yeah, I won it
from a contest online.

00:10:07.833 --> 00:10:11.083 align:middle
I used to have even more, but I
let my classmates tear into it.

00:10:11.167 --> 00:10:13.375 align:middle
Go on. Pick your poison.

00:10:13.458 --> 00:10:15.250 align:middle
You pick for me, how's that?

00:10:15.333 --> 00:10:17.833 align:middle
'Kay. Pomegranate?
Or perhaps fig?

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:19.458 align:middle
You got any strawberry?

00:10:19.542 --> 00:10:21.500 align:middle
Nah, Chika took the
liberty of picking through them

00:10:21.583 --> 00:10:23.375 align:middle
and claiming
every normal flavor.

00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:25.833 align:middle
[HORI]
So only weird kinds are left?

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:28.333 align:middle
Hey. What's that one?

00:10:28.417 --> 00:10:31.375 align:middle
Well, let's see.

00:10:31.458 --> 00:10:32.792 align:middle
Cheese?

00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:35.083 align:middle
Oh, wow. You know what?

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:37.292 align:middle
Last I checked,
Shindo didn't like cheese.

00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:38.708 align:middle
Still don't.

00:10:38.792 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle
I would rather go bankrupt
than choke that junk down.

00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:43.625 align:middle
I thought as much.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.000 align:middle
Say "ahh." Ahh.

00:10:48.083 --> 00:10:49.375 align:middle
[gasps]

00:10:49.458 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle
[SHINDO]
Miyamura's feeding me candy!

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:53.333 align:middle
I can hardly believe my eyes.

00:10:53.417 --> 00:10:55.083 align:middle
This may never happen again.

00:10:55.167 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle
But why's it gotta be
cheese flavored?

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.167 align:middle
[HORI]
I can't help but wonder

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.083 align:middle
if these guys are
really friends.

00:11:03.167 --> 00:11:04.125 align:middle
Is it tasty?

00:11:04.208 --> 00:11:06.125 align:middle
You know damn
well that it's not!

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:08.250 align:middle
Such a big meanie!

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:10.125 align:middle
You tried one?
What kind is it?

00:11:10.208 --> 00:11:12.083 align:middle
Ugh! It says it's "clay."

00:11:12.167 --> 00:11:13.292 align:middle
Clay flavored?

00:11:13.375 --> 00:11:16.000 align:middle
[HORI]
More like mistake flavored.

00:11:26.583 --> 00:11:28.375 align:middle
I need water.

00:11:28.458 --> 00:11:29.583 align:middle
Will you get me some?

00:11:29.667 --> 00:11:31.917 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Ugh. You're such a pain.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.500 align:middle
Who's the one
that made me eat it?

00:11:36.667 --> 00:11:38.292 align:middle
Earth to Hori. Come in.

00:11:38.375 --> 00:11:40.417 align:middle
Sorry. He stole my candy.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.292 align:middle
Aww, that little thief!

00:11:42.375 --> 00:11:44.167 align:middle
What flavor was it again?

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.333 align:middle
I've got more.

00:11:45.417 --> 00:11:47.042 align:middle
Oh, I don't need a
replacement, but thanks!

00:11:47.125 --> 00:11:49.958 align:middle
[SHINDO] Alrighty. Oo,
you should try this one next.

00:11:56.417 --> 00:11:57.417 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
What do you know?

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.167 align:middle
It does taste like clay.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.333 align:middle
So what's the deal?

00:12:01.417 --> 00:12:03.083 align:middle
Did your fan club
disband or something?

00:12:03.167 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle
Guess the novelty
of it wore off.

00:12:05.333 --> 00:12:08.833 align:middle
Which is honestly fine by me.

00:12:08.917 --> 00:12:10.708 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Uh. You know her?

00:12:10.792 --> 00:12:13.583 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
No. I don't think I do.

00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:16.417 align:middle
She was definitely giving me
a death glare, though.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.667 align:middle
But, why was she giving
you a death glare?

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.500 align:middle
No idea.

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:24.417 align:middle
We were watching TV

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.458 align:middle
and then it came on
out of nowhere!

00:12:26.542 --> 00:12:28.417 align:middle
We totally flipped out!

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle
Are you doing okay?

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.250 align:middle
Yeah. I'm fine.

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:32.667 align:middle
Just, uh...

Rumor has it that you're
Miyamura's girlfriend.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.833 align:middle
The rumors are true.

00:12:39.917 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle
And your point is?

Sorry to bother you!

Okay. She's giving me a complex!

you're breaking up with her!

You tell me when
you're gonna break up

with Hori this instant!

00:13:21.292 --> 00:13:22.042 align:middle
He's cheating?

00:13:22.125 --> 00:13:24.042 align:middle
Sounds like it.

00:13:24.125 --> 00:13:25.292 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I'm not!

00:13:25.375 --> 00:13:27.583 align:middle
[SAWADA] When are you
ending things with her?

00:13:27.667 --> 00:13:30.000 align:middle
I'm never ending
things with her!

And I'll return!

00:13:35.583 --> 00:13:38.125 align:middle
Great, but you really
don't have to come back.

00:13:38.208 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle
[SAWADA]
Oh, I will!

00:13:40.083 --> 00:13:41.625 align:middle
I can't wait.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.833 align:middle
[HORI] Hmm... So this
girl is a second-year.

00:13:44.917 --> 00:13:46.750 align:middle
Yeah.

00:13:46.833 --> 00:13:50.250 align:middle
And she stalks me during every
single break, without fail.

00:13:51.042 --> 00:13:52.750 align:middle
Remind me what
her name is again.

There! You see?

00:13:56.083 --> 00:13:58.958 align:middle
Ugh... Okay, why do you keep
following my boyfriend, huh?

00:13:59.042 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle
What exactly are you playing at?

00:14:00.833 --> 00:14:03.208 align:middle
I-I'm not playing.

00:14:03.292 --> 00:14:04.333 align:middle
Then what do you want?

00:14:04.417 --> 00:14:06.000 align:middle
Hey. Pump the hate brakes.

00:14:06.083 --> 00:14:08.875 align:middle
What I want is
no longer mine to have!

00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle
I like you so much,
but you're taken!

00:14:10.833 --> 00:14:13.083 align:middle
It's not fair!

He's just a pierced
bag of skin and bones!

What the heck do
you see in this guy?

00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.167 align:middle
I had a crush on you first

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:23.708 align:middle
and like you a bajillion
times more, Hori!

00:14:23.792 --> 00:14:25.292 align:middle
Plot twist!

00:14:25.375 --> 00:14:27.250 align:middle
What the...?
When did you get here?

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:28.625 align:middle
I've been here, dude,

00:14:28.708 --> 00:14:31.208 align:middle
'cause I knew something
funny was about to go down.

00:14:31.292 --> 00:14:34.000 align:middle
You can laugh it up
after you get 'er off me!

00:14:34.083 --> 00:14:35.875 align:middle
Okay. That's enough.

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.125 align:middle
Hug-time is over.

00:14:37.208 --> 00:14:38.417 align:middle
[SAWADA]
Shut it, you punk.

00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:41.625 align:middle
Hah. What'd you call me?

00:14:41.708 --> 00:14:43.542 align:middle
[SAWADA]
A dirty punk.

00:14:49.542 --> 00:14:50.458 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Let go of her!

00:14:50.542 --> 00:14:51.875 align:middle
[SAWADA]
Never!

00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.083 align:middle
If you were a boy,

00:14:53.167 --> 00:14:54.833 align:middle
I would have
headbutted you by now!

00:14:54.917 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle
My feelings run deeper
than you can imagine!

00:14:57.333 --> 00:14:59.917 align:middle
And you still haven't told me
what you even see in this guy!

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.667 align:middle
Ehh. I can't think of anything
off the top of my head.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.958 align:middle
You should be able
to answer straight away!

00:15:09.042 --> 00:15:10.833 align:middle
She's mine!

Took you long enough, Yoshikawa.

00:15:13.417 --> 00:15:15.125 align:middle
The show's basically
in its final act.

00:15:15.208 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle
Huh?

00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:19.417 align:middle
The end of a comedy
is still a comedy.

[SAWADA]
Looky here, Senpai!

00:15:21.125 --> 00:15:22.583 align:middle
I made these
sweet treats in home ec,

Ever hear the term
"personal space"?

[HORI]
And there they go again.

00:15:29.292 --> 00:15:31.083 align:middle
Ever hear the term
"shut your face"?

I'll talk all I want!

00:15:32.792 --> 00:15:34.833 align:middle
Doesn't matter if you like me
hanging around Hori- <i>senpai</i>

00:15:34.917 --> 00:15:36.333 align:middle
'cause she already said I could!

Right? Remember?

00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:40.375 align:middle
Um, yeah... I do.

Come on.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.833 align:middle
Don't wanna be late for class.

00:15:46.917 --> 00:15:48.917 align:middle
Pushy.

[MIYAMURA]
Listen. Let's just go.

00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.417 align:middle
It's a formal boyfriend request.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.875 align:middle
Okay. Sure.

00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.875 align:middle

Senpai!

Miyamura.

00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle
Why you obsessive little...

00:16:05.083 --> 00:16:06.667 align:middle
You have to stop
popping out of nowhere,

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:07.833 align:middle
it's annoying as hell!

00:16:07.917 --> 00:16:09.625 align:middle
Hori's not with you today?

00:16:09.708 --> 00:16:12.667 align:middle
She went home early to get
some stuff taken care of.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.042 align:middle
[sighs]

00:16:14.125 --> 00:16:16.667 align:middle
In that case, I guess
I'll make my way home, too.

00:16:30.333 --> 00:16:32.667 align:middle
Why're you going
the exact same route as me?

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.667 align:middle
You know that's my line, right?

00:16:49.042 --> 00:16:50.125 align:middle
Are you kidding?

00:16:50.208 --> 00:16:52.292 align:middle
Now that's my line!

00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:54.667 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] Am I being pranked
right now or something?

00:16:55.458 --> 00:16:58.042 align:middle
Don't tell me. My key.

00:16:58.125 --> 00:17:00.167 align:middle
I left it inside.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.125 align:middle
[SAWADA]
Thanks for the cake!

00:17:07.125 --> 00:17:08.792 align:middle
That's good!

00:17:08.875 --> 00:17:10.750 align:middle
So you always invite
cute girls inside

00:17:10.833 --> 00:17:12.125 align:middle
and give 'em sugar?

00:17:12.208 --> 00:17:14.625 align:middle
As a matter of fact,
it's a pretty rare thing.

00:17:14.708 --> 00:17:17.250 align:middle
Hori doesn't even
come over very often.

00:17:20.583 --> 00:17:22.167 align:middle
Thought you guys were
still in the cupcake phase,

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.625 align:middle
but sounds like you're
already losing your flavor.

00:17:24.708 --> 00:17:28.458 align:middle
She has no need to 'cause
I'm usually over at her place.

00:17:28.542 --> 00:17:30.125 align:middle
I see.

00:17:30.208 --> 00:17:32.875 align:middle
So, do you have any siblings?

00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.125 align:middle
Nope, it's just me
and my parents.

00:17:35.208 --> 00:17:37.250 align:middle
Huh...

00:17:37.333 --> 00:17:40.208 align:middle
I totally had you pegged you
as like an older brother.

00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:41.542 align:middle
And why's that?

00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:44.250 align:middle
You're good at
taking care of people.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.042 align:middle

What a tragedy.

It's so sad that they had
to lose their eldest like that.

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:47.083 align:middle
because he went
to a different school.

been since he died?

tell us your name.
