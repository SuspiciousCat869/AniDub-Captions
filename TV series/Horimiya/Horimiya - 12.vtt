00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:16.224 position:50% align:center
Yesterday, I hung out at Toru's
place for the first time.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.977 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI] Eeeee!
Remi needs details, stat!

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.979 position:50% align:center
What you're imagining
definitely didn't happen,

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50% align:center
so calm down.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:23.857 position:50% align:center
I learned he's got a massive TV

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:25.942 position:50% align:center
and enough spare rooms
to house a small village

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:27.652 position:50% align:center
on the second and third floors!

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.696 position:50% align:center
I thought he was
a poor pleb like me.

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.656 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
Um. My condolences?

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:32.866 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:34.743 position:50% align:center
Hush, you stupid-rich asshole!

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:36.870 position:50% align:center
--[ISHIKAWA] The hell did I do?
--[MIYAMURA] So?

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:39.247 position:50% align:center
I'll go ahead and pre-order
a cake after all.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.416 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Our shop doesn't
really do pre-orders,

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.585 position:50% align:center
but for you, I think
we'll make an exception.

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:45.337 position:50% align:center
Can't have Christmas
without a cake.

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.464 position:50% align:center
So what kind do you want?

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:50.050 position:50% align:center
One with tons of whipped cream
globbed on sounds great!

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:51.509 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.473 position:50% align:center
[SOTA] I asked Yuna
to spend Christmas with us!

00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:58.391 position:50% align:center
So then with Yuna and Miyamura,

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.226 position:50% align:center
that brings the
headcount up to six.

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:02.687 position:50% align:center
Wait. Is he even gonna make it?

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.441 position:50% align:center
[KYOSUKE] He better!
So make sure you invite him!

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.443 position:50% align:center
It's cool if you wanna skip out,

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:11.279 position:50% align:center
but it just wouldn't be
Christmas without Miyamura.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:13.740 position:50% align:center
You want Christmas?
Then go sleep in a manger.

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:16.910 position:50% align:center
Man, wish I could.

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:18.370 position:50% align:center
But starting the 23rd,

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.872 position:50% align:center
I'll prob'ly be busy
helping out at the shop.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.665 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Figured as much.

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:26.336 position:50% align:center
Though, if I can, I'll try
and stop by for a minute.

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:29.005 position:50% align:center
No. It's cool if
you don't have time. Heh.

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:31.800 position:50% align:center
Our celebration is pretty much
done once dinner is over.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:32.759 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
I'm sorry.

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:35.804 position:50% align:center
No! How can you not spend
the holiday with us, Miyamura?

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:36.930 position:50% align:center
Well, you know.

00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:39.391 position:50% align:center
It's just the time of year
baked goods are in high demand.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:40.850 position:50% align:center
You hafta come over!

00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:43.436 position:50% align:center
Please, bro?
I'll be sad if you don't!

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:45.480 position:50% align:center
Sota. Don't make
this even harder.

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:46.564 position:50% align:center
But, bro!

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:47.440 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Forgive me!

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:48.608 position:50% align:center
[SOTA]
Come back!

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.110 position:50% align:center
Call me when you get home!

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:52.070 position:50% align:center
[SOTA] All I want for
Christmas is you, bro!

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.863 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
You know he's dating me, right?

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.198 position:50% align:center
[KYOSUKE]
Hey! Miyamura!

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.117 position:50% align:center
[SOTA]
Big bro!

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.087 position:50% align:center
Up until recently,

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:34.381 position:50% align:center
I've been crushing
pretty hard on Hori, right?

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.217 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
Recently?

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:39.719 position:50% align:center
[IURA] I thought he
gave up on her ages ago.

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:43.014 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] And you guys already
know about the whole Kono thing.

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.016 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU] Don't assume
that we're in the loop.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
Nope, he lost me.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.353 position:50% align:center
I'll still hear him out, though.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:49.688 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Then there's Yoshikawa.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.773 position:50% align:center
No denying we crossed
the friendship line,

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:53.900 position:50% align:center
but I think it's still
too soon to date her.

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:55.151 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Huh?

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:55.985 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.028 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
Huh?

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.029 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Huh?

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.489 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU, IURA]
Uuuuuuuuh....

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.658 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Uuuuuuuuh....

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.910 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU, IURA] I was under the
impression they were dating.

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.829 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] I knew you dumb
jerks would react like that!

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.081 position:50% align:center
I don't know why, but I
thought you two would think,

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:09.249 position:50% align:center
"I thought they were dating,"

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
without even thinking
to properly consult me!

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.877 position:50% align:center
If you don't stop
with all that thinking,

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.462 position:50% align:center
your thoughts'll
give us an aneurysm!

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
You thought. We thought?

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:18.508 position:50% align:center
The point of the matter
is that we're not dating!

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center
[IURA] So, what?
Do you not like her like that?

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
I do like her!

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:26.433 position:50% align:center
Wow. It takes a confident
man to yell that out loud.

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:29.644 position:50% align:center
It's this weird limbo,
but it's where we are.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.396 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't say
that it's "weird."

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.148 position:50% align:center
A little surprising, sure.

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.900 position:50% align:center
But, like,
who cares what we think?

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.277 position:50% align:center
The only opinion
that really matters

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:40.071 position:50% align:center
in this situation
is Yoshikawa's.

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:42.907 position:50% align:center
The important thing is
if you two are happy

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.701 position:50% align:center
with your current relationship.

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:46.995 position:50% align:center
And more power
to you if you are.

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:50.707 position:50% align:center
It's not my place to say
that how you label it is right.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
Guys? What's wrong?

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.127 position:50% align:center
Teach me to be cool like you.

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.837 position:50% align:center
Just leave it to
the master of romance

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.630 position:50% align:center
to tell you exactly
what you need to hear.

00:04:57.672 --> 00:05:00.550 position:50% align:center
How'd I suddenly become
the master of romance?

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:08.641 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Aha! I finally found you!

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.643 position:50% align:center
You mind if I hang
at your place today?

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.063 position:50% align:center
I wanna finish that game
we started before.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:15.523 position:50% align:center
You do? That's fine by me.

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.067 position:50% align:center
Let's beat it together.

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:18.151 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center
Actually! We better not.

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
Oh, okay. You have plans?

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
Well. Not plans, per se.

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:27.243 position:50% align:center
It's because of something else.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.955 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Know what?
Never mind. You can come.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:34.250 position:50% align:center
Uh! It's fine!
I can take a rain check, Toru!

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.002 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA sighs]
There's no need.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:38.755 position:50% align:center
It was gonna
happen sooner or later.

00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:40.548 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
I'll never get used to this.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.926 position:50% align:center
It's just so huge!

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.513 position:50% align:center
I'm home.

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:47.681 position:50% align:center
Why so quiet?

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.266 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Shhh! Be a little
more careful with the doors,

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.101 position:50% align:center
and let's go upstairs.

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:52.811 position:50% align:center
C'mon! Hurry!

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:57.232 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Soft footsteps. That's it.

00:05:57.273 --> 00:06:00.276 position:50% align:center
Jeez! Why is this dang
hallway so friggin' long?

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.237 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Oh. Maybe his parents are home,

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:04.906 position:50% align:center
and he doesn't
want me to meet them.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:07.450 position:50% align:center
Would it really be the end of
the world if that happened?

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:08.743 position:50% align:center
Sorry for rushing you.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.662 position:50% align:center
You're a real one.

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.497 position:50% align:center
I wish I were a hot guy.

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.416 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't have to jump
through hoops like that.

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:16.209 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Huh? What hoops?

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.502 position:50% align:center
What're you talking about?

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're a girl.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.047 position:50% align:center
But, if I were a boy...

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.923 position:50% align:center
[door locks]

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:22.924 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Whoa, hey!

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:25.844 position:50% align:center
Was that click the sound
of the door locking?

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:27.345 position:50% align:center
That's not a problem, is it?

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:28.221 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:30.015 position:50% align:center
Why the heck are you
taking your clothes off?

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:30.932 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
I'm not!

00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:32.559 position:50% align:center
The only thing that
I'm taking off is my tie

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.269 position:50% align:center
'cause it's what I always do?

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:38.440 position:50% align:center
--[ISHIKAWAA] Yoshikawa--
--[screams]

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.316 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
A little better?

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:47.198 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.326 position:50% align:center
Could've sworn you knew,
but I'm far from a creep.

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:51.661 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna
spend time with me,

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
then the last thing
I want you to feel is uneasy.

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:58.960 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Didn't cross my
mind till she panicked.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:01.338 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
No. It's fine.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:02.172 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
Of course I'm
comfortable around you!

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:06.343 position:50% align:center
'Cause why wouldn't I be?

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:09.262 position:50% align:center
Oh. Um. That's good.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Good.

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:13.600 position:50% align:center
Good. Eh-heh.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:17.854 position:50% align:center
[YASHIRO]
That you, Toru?

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Crap! The door!

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:20.648 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Huh?

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.693 position:50% align:center
[YASHIRO] Hey. Why are
you trying to shut me out?

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:25.737 position:50% align:center
You have a friend over?

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:28.156 position:50% align:center
Yep! Gonna chill
and play a video game!

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.908 position:50% align:center
Nothing you need
to come in here for!

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.994 position:50% align:center
Wait. This woman.
Is she your mother?

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:35.497 position:50% align:center
[YASHIRO] At least let me get
the two of you some drinks.

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:38.917 position:50% align:center
We're okay!

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] Her foot's in.
It's over, my guy.

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:43.755 position:50% align:center
[YASHIRO] Why are you acting
like this in front of a guest?

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:45.215 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] You know,
if I shouldn't be here,

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.800 position:50% align:center
I can still take
that rain check.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.510 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Yoshikawa. No! Stay put!

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:50.011 position:50% align:center
You are right
where you need to be!

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
'Kay!

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:55.183 position:50% align:center
[YASHIRO]
So, her name's Yoshikawa?

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.227 position:50% align:center
Are you in the mood
for some cake?

00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:58.728 position:50% align:center
Um. Sure.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.647 position:50% align:center
Let me go grab
you a slice, then.

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:02.524 position:50% align:center
Hey. I told you we were good.

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:05.360 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] Who is this
charming, vivacious...

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.737 position:50% align:center
...amazonian woman?

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
It'll be the work
of a minute, okay?

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:11.533 position:50% align:center
Fine.

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:12.492 position:50% align:center
But, knock when you come back

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:14.244 position:50% align:center
so we have a little
warning wouldja?

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:15.537 position:50% align:center
[YASHIRO]
Heh, heh, heh.

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:16.871 position:50% align:center
Hey, that cake isn't
gonna serve itself,

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:18.289 position:50% align:center
so you better hop to it.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
Funny how quickly
you change your tune.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.129 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA groans]

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.797 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Is that your mom?

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.340 position:50% align:center
Thankfully, no.

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:29.801 position:50% align:center
She just helps out around
the house from time to time.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.094 position:50% align:center
Name's Yashiro.

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:34.472 position:50% align:center
And she loves bombarding me
with questions about you.

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:35.306 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.141 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
She'll be like,

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.934 position:50% align:center
"Who were you walking
with the other day, Toru?"

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:41.688 position:50% align:center
or, "Your mother told me
you had a girl over, Toru!"

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
It's like she has
this weird sixth sense.

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:46.026 position:50% align:center
Toru? Who are you talking about?

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:48.820 position:50% align:center
I know you didn't just barge
in here without knocking now!

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.363 position:50% align:center
Whoops! Guess I did.

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
So cheesecake isn't
the only kind we have.

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:54.367 position:50% align:center
There's shortcake as well.

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:55.660 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
I'll take the shor...

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.746 position:50% align:center
No. Cheesecake sounds good.

00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:59.330 position:50% align:center
[YASHIRO]
Mm-hmm.

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:02.083 position:50% align:center
A friendly reminder.
Your mom's on speed dial.

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.585 position:50% align:center
Hands to yourself, young man.

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.545 position:50% align:center
Oh, please. You actually
think I'd pull something

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.630 position:50% align:center
knowing you're in the next room?

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:09.716 position:50% align:center
[YASHIRO] Holler if
you kids need anything!

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.468 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah.

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:13.636 position:50% align:center
Ah. Sorry.

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:15.305 position:50% align:center
She's just acting extra annoying

00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:17.640 position:50% align:center
because she finally got
a chance to meet you.

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:18.933 position:50% align:center
She's nice, I swear.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:20.560 position:50% align:center
Oh. Cool.

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:21.728 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] You actually
think I'd pull something

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.189 position:50% align:center
knowing you're in the next room?

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:28.151 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] So if Yashiro
wasn't in the next room,

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center
what would he try to pull?

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.654 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Yoshikawa?

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.699 position:50% align:center
What did you have for lunch
that's making you act so jumpy?

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:35.617 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:37.952 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] Yes!
And my lunch was normal! Gosh!

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.371 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Hmmm...

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:40.663 position:50% align:center
Hey! Don't stare!

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:42.540 position:50% align:center
You know that it's beyond rude!

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:57.097 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] So how
'bout that video game? Hm?

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:02.102 position:50% align:center
Oh. Right.

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:04.062 position:50% align:center
We'll definitely beat it today!

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.271 position:50% align:center
Oh. Know what?

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:07.941 position:50% align:center
Might help if it's
plugged in, huh?

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:09.442 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
I'm happy.

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:12.112 position:50% align:center
I like things the way they are.

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:16.074 position:50% align:center
[YASHIRO] This bakery's
cakes are fantastic!

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:18.827 position:50% align:center
Wait till you try!

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:20.745 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA, YOSHIKAWA]
It's from Miyamura's shop.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.046 position:50% align:center
Ah. Sengoku!

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:33.800 position:50% align:center
Ah! Hey, Remi.

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.760 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
What the hell, dude?

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
Sorry.

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:40.890 position:50% align:center
So, um, just making sure,

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:43.810 position:50% align:center
but you're coming
for Christmas, aren't you?

00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:48.857 position:50% align:center
'Cause, I mean. It's Christmas.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.234 position:50% align:center
So why wouldn't you? Right?

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:53.737 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
We could spend it at my place.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.156 position:50% align:center
I'd prefer my place,
so please come!

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:58.908 position:50% align:center
Um. No thanks.

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:03.079 position:50% align:center
Do you not have a heart?

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.540 position:50% align:center
She's in tears because of you!

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.334 position:50% align:center
There you go, let it all out.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:08.418 position:50% align:center
Who'da thought he'd say no?

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.252 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Miyamura!

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:11.796 position:50% align:center
I think this calls for one
of your signature headbutts!

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.923 position:50% align:center
--[MIYAMURA] You got it!
--[screams]

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:16.760 position:50% align:center
Guys. Let's hear his
side of the story first.

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:18.720 position:50% align:center
I have a good
reason for declining!

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:21.306 position:50% align:center
You would, too, if you knew
what she keeps in her house!

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:23.224 position:50% align:center
I'd rather not discuss
it if given the choice,

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.352 position:50% align:center
but here goes!

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center
Home sweet home. Heh.

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:34.069 position:50% align:center
The mantis stares at me!

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.653 position:50% align:center
His beady eyes see
through my soul!

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:36.571 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
Those don't belong to Remi!

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:37.947 position:50% align:center
Every last one of them
is her father's!

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
She can take them down
if they freak you out!

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.201 position:50% align:center
[ALL 4]
The mantis?

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:45.080 position:50% align:center
You should've got your grades
at the assembly today.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:46.539 position:50% align:center
May I see?

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:52.504 position:50% align:center
Look! Our little braniac
managed to score an A

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:54.756 position:50% align:center
in every subject
except Art and PE!

00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:55.590 position:50% align:center
[KYOSUKE]
'Course she did!

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:58.176 position:50% align:center
She's a smarty-pants
like her old man.

00:11:58.218 --> 00:11:59.386 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
I suppose she does
take after you in math.

00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:03.556 position:50% align:center
Hope the similarities
stop there.

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:05.225 position:50% align:center
[KYOSUKE]
And why would you hope that?

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:07.977 position:50% align:center
This must be such an
emotional moment for you.

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:08.812 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Why?

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:10.563 position:50% align:center
[KYOSUKE] Uh, I believe
I asked a question first.

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO]
You're a third-year, Kyoko.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.566 position:50% align:center
The next time you
receive your grades,

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:15.777 position:50% align:center
you'll be getting a diploma.

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
That's right.

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:21.491 position:50% align:center
Once April rolls around,

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:24.369 position:50% align:center
I won't be in
high school anymore.

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.162 position:50% align:center
I got my report card, too!

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:28.498 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Wow! Great job, buddy!

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.666 position:50% align:center
[SOTA] I got a perfect
hundred in Japanese!

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
[HORI] This time next year,
what will my life look like?

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:40.093 position:50% align:center
After graduation,
what am I gonna do?

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
[SOTA] I've got in right
in front of your face,

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
you're not even
looking at it, are you?

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.515 position:50% align:center
I was happy about your grades!

00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center
C'mon!

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:49.436 position:50% align:center
I've been working hard all year
and was excited to share.

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:50.895 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Knock it off!

00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:55.817 position:50% align:center
[IORI]
Thank you! Happy holidays!

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:07.996 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
Whoa!

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
That is one big Christmas tree.

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:14.252 position:50% align:center
[MIKI] Looking up too much
makes you lose perspective.

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:17.172 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI] Oh! You're
Yoshikawa's sister, right?

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:18.882 position:50% align:center
[MIKI]
You don't have your glasses on.

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:19.799 position:50% align:center
How did you know?

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:22.761 position:50% align:center
I made the switch over
to contacts fairly recently.

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center
Oh, you don't say.

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:25.221 position:50% align:center
I've avoided them for years,

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:27.432 position:50% align:center
but maybe I should
finally give 'em a try.

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:29.017 position:50% align:center
I'll buy them
for you if you'd like.

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:30.518 position:50% align:center
We could go right now.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.686 position:50% align:center
What? Why?

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.980 position:50% align:center
Because it's Christmas.
That's why.

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
[MIKI] It's still a little
strange for a high school kid

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:38.818 position:50% align:center
to buy a college
student contacts.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.528 position:50% align:center
Isn't that also
why you're dressed up?

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center
[MIKI]
Not quite.

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:44.157 position:50% align:center
I was interviewing
for potential jobs.

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:45.992 position:50% align:center
I try to get money and work.

00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:47.452 position:50% align:center
Yuki tries to goof off.

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50% align:center
You're laughing
because it's true,

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:53.041 position:50% align:center
and we're both well aware.

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:55.919 position:50% align:center
So please don't hold
back on my account.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.962 position:50% align:center
Dumb baby sis.

00:13:58.004 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
That wasn't why I...

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:01.007 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear.

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:03.885 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER] All right!
Let's take a look, shall we?

00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.055 position:50% align:center
[TANIHARA'S BROTHER]
Why you watchin' this?

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:08.932 position:50% align:center
You want somethin' sweet?

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:09.849 position:50% align:center
[TANIHARA]
Nah.

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:12.268 position:50% align:center
You make a better door
than a window, you know!

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.937 position:50% align:center
It's kinda hard
to see the screen.

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:15.063 position:50% align:center
That means move!

00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:16.606 position:50% align:center
I don't care if you're
sick or my brother,

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:18.358 position:50% align:center
if you talk like that
to me again, you're dead!

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.277 position:50% align:center
And put your nasty tissues
in the trash, dumbass!

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:22.570 position:50% align:center
[TANIHARA]
That's what I've been doing!

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:25.657 position:50% align:center
But Kiko keeps taking
them out and playing with them!

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
[TANIHARA'S BROTHER]
Yeah, right!

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:27.659 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:30.620 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER] That's all for our
Cake Report here at Iori Bakery.

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:31.871 position:50% align:center
[TANIHARA]
You made me miss it!

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:32.872 position:50% align:center
[TANIHARA'S BROTHER]
Ugh!

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:35.250 position:50% align:center
Keep your damn
germs away from me!

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:38.712 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:48.304 position:50% align:center
You think you can
put the books down

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:49.681 position:50% align:center
long enough to eat dinner?

00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:52.684 position:50% align:center
Oh. Of course.

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:54.936 position:50% align:center
That's our food?
You went all out!

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:57.772 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Come on, Sengoku.

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:03.069 position:50% align:center
You can endure a few bugs
for Remi's sake, right?

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
She said you agreed to meet up
with her at seven o'clock.

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
It's 6:30, so you
can still make it.

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:11.578 position:50% align:center
Will you be spending
Christmas by yourself, Sakura?

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:13.413 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Considering I'm Buddhist, yes.

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:15.498 position:50% align:center
Same as every year!

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.710 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
Guess I'll get going.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:23.256 position:50% align:center
You were doing so well!

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:24.215 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
It's no use!

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:25.175 position:50% align:center
I can't hold down a meal

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:27.594 position:50% align:center
with those creepy
crawlies around!

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:30.180 position:50% align:center
[KONO] Remember, you're
having dinner with Remi,

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:32.098 position:50% align:center
not the insects.

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:38.104 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] I could always repeat
a year and stay back with you.

00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:41.733 position:50% align:center
Or on second thought.

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:43.985 position:50% align:center
You could hurry up and graduate.

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:45.945 position:50% align:center
[SHINDO]
Yeah, that'd be nice.

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:54.162 position:50% align:center
[SHINDO]
Wait for me.

00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:57.916 position:50% align:center
One more year.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.877 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Just 365 days to go.

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:02.671 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
We've been through this.

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
He has to work,
so he couldn't be here.

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:08.218 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but it's your job
to force 'im to come anyway.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:10.762 position:50% align:center
[HORI] It's my job to
compromise his livelihood?

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
Although, he is gonna stop
by and drop off our cake.

00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:15.517 position:50% align:center
[KYOSUKE]
Ah, now we're talkin'!

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:17.435 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO] Do you think he'll
have time to come in for a bit?

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:18.895 position:50% align:center
No.

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:21.481 position:50% align:center
He'll probably just say
"hi," "bye," and leave.

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center
Awww...

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:25.735 position:50% align:center
Mom, if you're bummed on
my behalf, I'm not sad!

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:26.569 position:50% align:center
Then you're on your own

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.279 position:50% align:center
because we're all
very sad about it.

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:29.531 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Huh?!

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
[YUNA]
Um, Kyoko?

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.329 position:50% align:center
Oh. Thank you, Yuna.

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
It's from Miyamura!

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.210 position:50% align:center
[KYOSUKE]
It's a Christmas miracle!

00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:43.420 position:50% align:center
Merry Christmas, guys.

00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:44.671 position:50% align:center
You're here!

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:45.505 position:50% align:center
Come play cards!

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:46.756 position:50% align:center
It's really fun.

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:47.716 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
I would if I could,

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:50.510 position:50% align:center
but they still need
me at the shop.

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
[KYOSUKE] Damn, your
hands must be freezing!

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
Get in here and warm up!

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO] I'll fix you
something hot to drink!

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:59.227 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Uh. Okay,
but I gotta down it and go.

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:01.271 position:50% align:center
[SOTA] Yes!
We can play a round of Old Maid!

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:03.773 position:50% align:center
[HORI] This is a whole lot
different from last year.

00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:09.863 position:50% align:center
I, uh, really do have
to get going now.

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:11.114 position:50% align:center
[ALL 4]
Aww.

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:12.532 position:50% align:center
Hey! Don't "aww" him!

00:17:12.574 --> 00:17:14.075 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.287 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go walk him
back to the bakery,

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:19.956 position:50% align:center
and I better not see
any of you following us!

00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:22.208 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Huh? You sure? It's cold out.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.877 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
I'm coming!

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:26.379 position:50% align:center
It's just snow and ice.

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:36.097 position:50% align:center
Everything gets
so quiet when it snows.

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:41.269 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Guess Hori's
affected by it, too.

00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:50.945 position:50% align:center
We'll be high school
grads pretty soon.

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:52.530 position:50% align:center
That we will.

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.449 position:50% align:center
But it's still months away.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Come to think of it.

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:01.873 position:50% align:center
Miyamura.

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
I still don't know you.

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:07.253 position:50% align:center
Not as well as I'd like to.

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50% align:center
I feel like I've barely
scratched the surface.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.595 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
So, listen, Hori.

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:17.847 position:50% align:center
When it comes to
knowing the real you,

00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:20.517 position:50% align:center
I feel like I've barely
scratched the surface.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.604 position:50% align:center
But that's okay!

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:27.774 position:50% align:center
We'll have time even
after we graduate because...

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:32.404 position:50% align:center
...I... I still...
wanna be with you!

00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:36.282 position:50% align:center
Well, as long as you
feel the same way,

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:37.909 position:50% align:center
which I hope you do.

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:45.291 position:50% align:center
So, um...

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:47.002 position:50% align:center
Could you please say something?

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:50.505 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Okay.

00:18:57.387 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
Will you marry me, Kyoko Hori?

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:11.359 position:50% align:center
You idiot. On that note.

00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:13.945 position:50% align:center
I swear to the moon and back,
I'll make you happy!

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:14.779 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:16.531 position:50% align:center
[HORI] I'm letting you know
if you make me your wife,

00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:18.658 position:50% align:center
I'll make you the happiest man
not only on this planet,

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
but the next!

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:23.163 position:50% align:center
Wait. I should be the
one telling you that.

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:24.748 position:50% align:center
[HORI] It wouldn't make
sense for you to say it.

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:25.749 position:50% align:center
I'm the self-centered one,

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.334 position:50% align:center
so I'd have to make
a conscious effort

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.586 position:50% align:center
to put your happiness
before my own!

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:31.421 position:50% align:center
You know it's true.

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:33.757 position:50% align:center
So you can't tell me that stuff!

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:35.091 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't think
that's how it works,

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:37.552 position:50% align:center
but who am I to argue?

00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:39.637 position:50% align:center
Never proposed before.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.931 position:50% align:center
I look forward to
our future together.

00:19:41.973 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
Uh, hopefully
it'll be a good one.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:01.618 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Right! Yes! On my way!

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:03.411 position:50% align:center
I really gotta book it back now!

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:06.331 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Oh, sure. Be safe.

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:17.384 position:50% align:center
So cold! I better
get going, too!

00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:28.687 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
At least my face is warm.

00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:07.118 position:50% align:center
Do you always visit
a shrine on New Year's?

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.412 position:50% align:center
I try to, yeah.

00:22:09.454 --> 00:22:10.538 position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:22:11.289 --> 00:22:15.293 position:50% align:center
[HORI] I'll make an
appearance if there's no crowd.

00:22:15.335 --> 00:22:16.836 position:50% align:center
But we made it this far.

00:22:16.878 --> 00:22:18.755 position:50% align:center
Come on, let's do this!

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.512 position:50% align:center
So, what's your fortune say?

00:22:25.553 --> 00:22:27.639 position:50% align:center
Uh, "Remain calm
amidst the storm

00:22:27.681 --> 00:22:28.807 position:50% align:center
and keep moving forward."

00:22:28.848 --> 00:22:31.142 position:50% align:center
You're kidding.
There has to be more than that.

00:22:31.184 --> 00:22:32.560 position:50% align:center
I think it's fine.

00:22:32.602 --> 00:22:33.853 position:50% align:center
I have your smile in my life,

00:22:33.895 --> 00:22:36.106 position:50% align:center
and that's enough to keep me
calm and moving forward.

00:22:36.147 --> 00:22:37.524 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:37.565 --> 00:22:39.567 position:50% align:center
[HORI] What? I couldn't
hear you over the crowd.

00:22:39.609 --> 00:22:40.652 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Didn't say anything.

00:22:40.694 --> 00:22:41.486 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
No?

00:22:41.528 --> 00:22:43.196 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Nope. Must've been the wind.

00:22:45.031 --> 00:22:46.241 position:50% align:center
Well, for your info.

00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:48.368 position:50% align:center
I also get inspired
by your smile.

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:49.369 position:50% align:center
It makes me happy.

00:22:49.411 --> 00:22:50.954 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:50.995 --> 00:22:52.497 position:50% align:center
So you did hear me.

00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:53.832 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:22:57.085 --> 00:22:59.129 position:50% align:center
It's kind of a weird concept.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:02.048 position:50% align:center
You're gonna be the very
last person I see this year.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:03.383 position:50% align:center
But you'll be
the first one I see

00:23:03.425 --> 00:23:04.926 position:50% align:center
as soon as the new year starts.

00:23:04.968 --> 00:23:06.761 position:50% align:center
Wild.

00:23:09.514 --> 00:23:11.558 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
I guess you're right.

00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:13.018 position:50% align:center
And you know what else?

00:23:13.059 --> 00:23:15.812 position:50% align:center
I hope every year will be
like this from now on.

00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:34.372 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Hey, Miyamura?

00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:35.457 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Hmm?

00:23:35.498 --> 00:23:38.293 position:50% align:center
