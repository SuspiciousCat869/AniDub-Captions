00:00:13.917 --> 00:00:15.875 align:middle
Are you gonna
stay home again today?

00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.917 align:middle
[HORI] Yeah. I'm still
feeling a little yucky.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.333 align:middle
[SOTA]
Okie doke!

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:29.083 align:middle
[HORI] I faked being sick
so I could skip school.

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:33.917 align:middle
Also. Also, I'm in
love with you, Hori.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.917 align:middle
Have been for a while.

00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:39.750 align:middle
[HORI] I have no idea how
to face Miyamura after that.

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:44.167 align:middle
Even texting him sounds
difficult right now.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.458 align:middle
What the heck is wrong with me?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.417 align:middle
[IZUMI]
I can't hang out tomorrow.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.208 align:middle
But I'm free the next day!

00:00:51.292 --> 00:00:52.792 align:middle
[SOTA]
We can go to my place, then!

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:54.292 align:middle
I'll give my sister a heads up.

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:56.750 align:middle
Cool!

00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:58.458 align:middle
Huh?

00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:37.708 align:middle
[SOTA]
I'm home!

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle
[HORI]
Welcome back.

00:02:39.583 --> 00:02:41.833 align:middle
So, are you feeling
any better, Sissy?

00:02:41.917 --> 00:02:43.583 align:middle
[HORI]
Much better. Thanks for asking.

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:45.125 align:middle
Yeah, of course!

00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:46.917 align:middle
May I have some yogurt?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.292 align:middle
You may.

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:50.458 align:middle
[SOTA]
Oh! I saw my bro this morning!

00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:54.542 align:middle
Yeah? Did he seem okay?

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:56.750 align:middle
Yup, he was walking
with some girl

00:02:56.833 --> 00:02:58.292 align:middle
Uh?!

00:02:58.375 --> 00:03:00.208 align:middle
Hey. Which one do you wanna eat?

00:03:00.292 --> 00:03:02.708 align:middle
Wait. He was what?

00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:06.208 align:middle
Oh, neat! Says it has gummy
balls mixed inside! Wow!

00:03:06.292 --> 00:03:09.417 align:middle
It's also orange and
citrus sucks, so bon appétit.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.542 align:middle
Back up!

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:12.167 align:middle
Who was this girl he was with?

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.542 align:middle
Uh. I dunno.

00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:17.542 align:middle
She was wearing some
other uniform, though.

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle
[HORI]
A different uniform equals

00:03:19.083 --> 00:03:21.125 align:middle
some other high school girl,
and hanging out with her,

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:23.167 align:middle
times "also, I'm in
love with you" equals...

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.500 align:middle
He's cheating?

00:03:24.583 --> 00:03:25.375 align:middle
Is he cheating?

00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:27.042 align:middle
He's totally cheating!

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle
Cool your jets there, Kyoko.

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle
You shouldn't make assumptions.

00:03:33.083 --> 00:03:35.250 align:middle
They're probably just friends.

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:37.042 align:middle
Did they look like
pretty good pals?

00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle
Could you hear what
they were talking about?

00:03:39.083 --> 00:03:40.917 align:middle
Uh. No.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.917 align:middle
But she had her arm
wrapped around his.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.792 align:middle
Watch it, Sissy!

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:47.958 align:middle
You're making a mess!

00:03:48.042 --> 00:03:51.375 align:middle
[HORI]
A girl? Wrapped around his arm?

00:03:51.458 --> 00:03:53.667 align:middle
Why?

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.917 align:middle
This is stupid.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.250 align:middle
If I shoot him a text,

00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:58.125 align:middle
I could solve this mystery
in a matter of seconds.

00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:00.542 align:middle
It's not even that big
of a mystery to solve!

00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:02.167 align:middle
I bet she's a friend
from middle school,

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.458 align:middle
like Shindo, or maybe even...

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:18.625 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Hey, Hori!

00:04:18.708 --> 00:04:19.875 align:middle
Your cold all cleared up now?

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.542 align:middle
Hush! Why're you being so loud?

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:23.875 align:middle
Please forgive me!

00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:24.833 align:middle
[HORI]
Where's Miyamura?

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:26.583 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Hm? He's over there.

00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:30.417 align:middle
You being sick had the poor guy
worried out of his mind.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.792 align:middle
Let 'im know you're here.

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:34.083 align:middle
If you thought I was excited
to see you, then he...

00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:38.125 align:middle
Um. Okay...

00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:39.250 align:middle
[TEACHER]
Good morning, everyone!

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:40.708 align:middle
Please take a seat.

00:04:45.042 --> 00:04:47.500 align:middle
What? Hori actually
came to school?

00:04:47.583 --> 00:04:49.625 align:middle
I'm surprised I didn't
see her in homeroom.

00:04:49.708 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle
She was here for
the whole first period.

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.208 align:middle
Except she was
on edge like whoa!

00:04:54.292 --> 00:04:55.833 align:middle
No idea what that's about.

00:04:55.917 --> 00:04:58.667 align:middle
And she was avoiding you,
which is bizarre.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.792 align:middle
Did you two have a fight?

00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:03.292 align:middle
Nothing like that, no.

00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:05.417 align:middle
No? If you say so.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.458 align:middle
[school bell tolls]

00:05:07.542 --> 00:05:09.333 align:middle
Time to head to the next one.

00:05:09.417 --> 00:05:10.583 align:middle
Let's bounce.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.000 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] On second thought,
you go on without me.

00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:17.542 align:middle
All right then.

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:27.042 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Hori?

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:29.583 align:middle
[screams]

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:31.667 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
"Ahhh," what?

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.292 align:middle
I just wanna talk
to you for a sec.

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.583 align:middle
[HORI] Sorry, but I gotta
head home early today!

00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:37.333 align:middle
Bye!

00:05:37.417 --> 00:05:38.875 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Were you awake?

00:05:40.542 --> 00:05:43.667 align:middle
You were, weren't you, Hori?

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.917 align:middle
You heard me.

00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:48.250 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Just so you know.

00:05:48.333 --> 00:05:51.167 align:middle
I said it because
I knew you were listening.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.000 align:middle
I did.

00:05:52.083 --> 00:05:52.875 align:middle
[HORI]
Who is she?

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:53.708 align:middle
Uh?!

00:05:53.792 --> 00:05:55.750 align:middle
Who? Wha...?

00:05:55.833 --> 00:06:00.125 align:middle
Th-There was someone Sota
saw you walking with. A girl.

00:06:00.208 --> 00:06:04.167 align:middle
Uh.... Hm...

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle
[HORI]
Say you have no idea.

00:06:05.583 --> 00:06:07.250 align:middle
Say Sota had the wrong guy.

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle
Say it was his imagination.

00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:10.833 align:middle
Say it's not like that, please!

00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:15.625 align:middle
Oh! You mean Chika, don't you?

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle
Chika. Huh?

00:06:17.833 --> 00:06:20.667 align:middle
Yeah! Must be. Goes to Pachi.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.708 align:middle
[HORI] So not only
do you let this girl

00:06:21.792 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle
hang all over you in public,

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:25.375 align:middle
but you call her
by her first name?

00:06:25.458 --> 00:06:28.333 align:middle
Bet she's smart if she goes
to the best school in town.

00:06:28.417 --> 00:06:29.375 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Wait a sec!

00:06:29.458 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle
I know what you're thinking,

00:06:30.833 --> 00:06:32.833 align:middle
but Chika and I are the
furthest thing from a thing!

00:06:32.917 --> 00:06:34.458 align:middle
Do you remember Shindo?

00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:35.625 align:middle
That's her boyfriend.

00:06:35.708 --> 00:06:37.583 align:middle
Not me. He's with Chika!

00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:39.917 align:middle
See, Chika fell
and twisted her ankle.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.292 align:middle
Then Shindo did too,

00:06:41.375 --> 00:06:44.125 align:middle
so I acted as a human crutch
for Chika and Shindo.

00:06:44.208 --> 00:06:46.125 align:middle
Believe me when
I say that Chika--

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:51.125 align:middle
Why is Chika suddenly your
favorite word to friggin' say?

00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:52.750 align:middle
I mean, what the hell?

00:06:52.833 --> 00:06:54.083 align:middle
Huh?

00:06:55.292 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle
But Chika and I really aren't--

00:06:57.708 --> 00:07:00.708 align:middle
[HORI] Chika this,
Chika that, just shut up!

00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:06.792 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] But I don't know
what her last name is.

00:07:06.875 --> 00:07:08.542 align:middle
She's more upset
about the name thing

00:07:08.625 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle
than she is about me
walking arm-in-arm with her?

00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:15.875 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
It's something so simple,

00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.417 align:middle
yet it made her so mad at me.

00:07:22.292 --> 00:07:24.958 align:middle
[HORI] I threw a book
in his face. Twice!

00:07:25.042 --> 00:07:27.875 align:middle
Best watch your back.
She's insane.

00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.125 align:middle
Totally. Just look at her eyes.

00:07:30.208 --> 00:07:31.792 align:middle
Come on, girl! Get a grip!

00:07:31.875 --> 00:07:33.958 align:middle
He would never say
that about me!

00:07:34.042 --> 00:07:35.208 align:middle
Hey, Sissy?

00:07:35.292 --> 00:07:37.292 align:middle
You can have yogurt!
Don't ask every--

00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:40.167 align:middle
[SOTA]
Big Bro came over.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.000 align:middle
Say I'm not here!

00:07:41.083 --> 00:07:42.375 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Hello.

00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:48.958 align:middle
You, uh, would
prefer if I left, huh?

00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:52.417 align:middle
No prob.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.083 align:middle
I like going places
for no reason at all.

00:07:55.167 --> 00:07:56.875 align:middle
Please. Feel free to stay.

00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle
Ahh. What a relief.

00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:02.125 align:middle
Here. You forgot these.

00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:04.917 align:middle
Uh! Um. Thanks.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.250 align:middle
So I was just gonna wait

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:08.125 align:middle
and give it to you
tomorrow at school.

00:08:08.208 --> 00:08:10.208 align:middle
But I bet you need it
for homework, right?

00:08:10.292 --> 00:08:12.958 align:middle
Uh. Yeah. Kind of.

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:18.333 align:middle
--He's definitely mad at me.
--She's definitely mad at me.

00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:22.042 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] The real question
is why is she mad?

00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:24.417 align:middle
She's seriously that
uptight about Chika?

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.417 align:middle
[HORI] He's probably
oblivious as to why I'm upset.

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:31.083 align:middle
--Um. Sorry.
--[HORI] I'm sorry!

00:08:31.167 --> 00:08:32.125 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Huh?

00:08:32.208 --> 00:08:34.958 align:middle
You know, for the books!

00:08:35.042 --> 00:08:36.042 align:middle
Both books.

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle
Oh! Don't worry 'bout that.

00:08:38.583 --> 00:08:40.417 align:middle
I'm the one who
kept saying Chi--!

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.833 align:middle
Uh... I mean, kept
mentioning Shindo's girlfriend.

00:08:43.917 --> 00:08:45.833 align:middle
And it was making you upset.

00:08:45.917 --> 00:08:46.917 align:middle
Hang on.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.958 align:middle
So do you not know
Chika's last name?

00:08:49.042 --> 00:08:53.458 align:middle
Ah, no. I don't have a clue.

00:08:53.542 --> 00:08:55.500 align:middle
Seriously?

00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:57.958 align:middle
Jeez!

00:08:58.042 --> 00:08:59.167 align:middle
You should've
said something sooner!

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.750 align:middle
I wouldn't have jumped
to the wrong conclusion

00:09:00.833 --> 00:09:02.667 align:middle
if you'd cleared
the air from the get-go!

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle
But I did try to clear the air,
you just didn't wanna listen.

00:09:06.583 --> 00:09:08.833 align:middle
Well, I listen to
you most of the time.

00:09:08.917 --> 00:09:10.667 align:middle
Like when I was sick.

00:09:14.875 --> 00:09:18.458 align:middle
That day. I heard everything.

00:09:21.792 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle
I see.

00:09:23.083 --> 00:09:25.125 align:middle
Not that I'm surprised
you heard what I said.

00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:27.083 align:middle
I figured you did.

00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:30.500 align:middle
And I wasn't expecting a
response from you or anything.

00:09:30.583 --> 00:09:31.958 align:middle
In truth,

00:09:32.042 --> 00:09:35.417 align:middle
I was scared of what you'd
say, but I still confessed.

00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:39.708 align:middle
Then I ran. Sorry.

00:09:39.792 --> 00:09:41.625 align:middle
--Miyamu--
--[door opens]

00:09:41.708 --> 00:09:45.208 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
Kyoko. Hey, hun.

00:09:45.292 --> 00:09:46.750 align:middle
Who's he?

00:09:48.042 --> 00:09:50.750 align:middle
What? Kyosuke!

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle
Where's Yuriko?

00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:56.417 align:middle
Or, more importantly,
what are you doing here?

00:09:57.458 --> 00:09:59.208 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
I came to hang out.

00:09:59.292 --> 00:10:01.292 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Don't tell me. Is he...?

00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:03.583 align:middle
So what's this dude doing here?

00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:04.917 align:middle
You have piercings?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.083 align:middle
Mind if I touch your hair?

00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:08.125 align:middle
There's no smoking
in the house, Kyosuke.

00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:10.708 align:middle
Bet a guy like you is a smoker.

00:10:10.792 --> 00:10:12.208 align:middle
You'd lose that bet.

00:10:12.292 --> 00:10:14.208 align:middle
These piercings are pretty dope.

00:10:14.292 --> 00:10:15.167 align:middle
You do 'em yourself?

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.167 align:middle
Uh. Yeah. Back in middle school.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.125 align:middle
Damn.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.000 align:middle
I said to take that outside.

00:10:24.083 --> 00:10:25.167 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
Sweetheart.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.833 align:middle
Good girls don't
clobber their daddies

00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:28.708 align:middle
with axe kicks to the cranium.

00:10:28.792 --> 00:10:30.583 align:middle
[HORI] Actually, I heard
daughter-to-father axe kicks

00:10:30.667 --> 00:10:31.667 align:middle
were all the rage.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.667 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
He is her dad.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.667 align:middle
[KYOSUKE sighs]

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.875 align:middle
Man, this is some welcome, huh?

00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.417 align:middle
Yurioko isn't here.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.542 align:middle
My own daughter
beats the crap outta me.

00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:43.083 align:middle
Plus, she brought home
some random guy!

00:10:43.167 --> 00:10:45.625 align:middle
[HORI] That's what you get
for showing up unannounced.

00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:47.333 align:middle
I would've called,
but I'm starving!

00:10:47.417 --> 00:10:48.917 align:middle
C'mon, feed your old man!

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.375 align:middle
[HORI]
What does that have to...?

00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:52.292 align:middle
Ugh. Never mind.

00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:53.667 align:middle
She'll groan about
making me something

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle
for a minute or two,
but she always caves.

00:10:57.333 --> 00:10:58.917 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Uh-huh. Oh! Right!

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.833 align:middle
I should've introdu--

00:10:59.917 --> 00:11:01.792 align:middle
Eh, just relax!

00:11:01.875 --> 00:11:03.833 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I am so confused!

00:11:03.917 --> 00:11:05.542 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
So, who are you?

00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:09.333 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] My name's Izumi
Miyamura and I go to Kiri High.

00:11:09.417 --> 00:11:11.750 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
Aha! Same school as Kyoko!

00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:13.042 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Yes, sir.

00:11:13.125 --> 00:11:15.417 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
Well, that's pretty cool.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.167 align:middle
Wait. I wasn't
interrupting you guys

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.667 align:middle
when I came in, was I?

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.125 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
No, not at all!

00:11:20.208 --> 00:11:21.542 align:middle
You sure?

00:11:22.583 --> 00:11:26.625 align:middle
Anyone ever told you, you've
got extremely long eyelashes?

00:11:26.708 --> 00:11:28.542 align:middle
Whoops. Clumsy me.

00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:32.375 align:middle
[KYOSUKE] Maybe next time be
a dear and put it on the table.

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:34.583 align:middle
I'm making a mental note now.

00:11:34.667 --> 00:11:35.500 align:middle
'Scuse her.

00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:36.708 align:middle
I don't have the slightest idea

00:11:36.792 --> 00:11:38.708 align:middle
where she got
this violent side from.

00:11:38.792 --> 00:11:40.042 align:middle
Ah. Come on now.

00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:42.375 align:middle
She doesn't have a violent side.

00:11:42.458 --> 00:11:44.333 align:middle
Not really.

00:11:44.417 --> 00:11:46.833 align:middle
Got siblings? A sister?
Brother maybe?

00:11:46.917 --> 00:11:48.292 align:middle
I'm an only child.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle
Ahhh...

00:11:49.833 --> 00:11:51.708 align:middle
You can't have my baby girl!

00:11:52.458 --> 00:11:53.708 align:middle
I'm kidding!

00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:55.875 align:middle
I just always wanted
to say that, you know?

00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.125 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] He's gonna
give me a heart attack!

00:11:58.208 --> 00:12:01.833 align:middle
So, uh, I noticed Hori calls
you by your first name,

00:12:01.917 --> 00:12:02.958 align:middle
which is interesting.

00:12:03.042 --> 00:12:04.083 align:middle
Since you're her dad.

00:12:04.167 --> 00:12:06.292 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
Speaking of, you do realize

00:12:06.375 --> 00:12:08.625 align:middle
Hori is my name, too.

00:12:08.708 --> 00:12:09.708 align:middle
I guess you'll have to call her

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:11.542 align:middle
by her first name
when I'm around.

00:12:11.625 --> 00:12:13.583 align:middle
Uh, sure.

00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:16.792 align:middle
Of course, I can do that.

00:12:16.875 --> 00:12:17.833 align:middle
Kyo--

00:12:17.917 --> 00:12:20.083 align:middle
I got you two
times in a row, kid!

00:12:20.167 --> 00:12:23.417 align:middle
How awkward would it have been
if you'd really called her that?

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I wish I were anywhere but here.

00:12:25.583 --> 00:12:27.583 align:middle
Hey! Come over here, Kyoko!

00:12:27.667 --> 00:12:29.875 align:middle
[HORI] I'm already feeding you,
what more do you want?

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.292 align:middle
It's about Miyamura.
So what's the deal?

00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:33.792 align:middle
Is he your boyfriend?

00:12:33.875 --> 00:12:34.792 align:middle
[gasps]

00:12:34.875 --> 00:12:36.958 align:middle
He's, uh...

00:12:39.083 --> 00:12:40.542 align:middle
Well...

00:12:42.125 --> 00:12:44.625 align:middle
Yeah, he is.
You got a problem with that?

00:12:44.708 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle
[KYOSUKE groans]

00:12:46.083 --> 00:12:47.875 align:middle
What happened to that
mental note you said you...

00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.125 align:middle
Am I really?

00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:53.417 align:middle
No way! His hair is too long.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.458 align:middle
[HORI]
Look in a mirror lately?

00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:57.708 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Then, I'll cut it.

00:12:57.792 --> 00:13:00.917 align:middle
Just say the word and I will.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle
Nah, son.

00:13:02.083 --> 00:13:03.667 align:middle
Be a shame to waste those locks.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:04.958 align:middle
Why not just tie them back?

00:13:05.042 --> 00:13:06.167 align:middle
[HORI]
Please, Miyamura.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.417 align:middle
Ignore him.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.333 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
You mean like this?

00:13:09.417 --> 00:13:10.833 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
Hey, get us some bobby pins!

00:13:10.917 --> 00:13:12.750 align:middle
Uh?!

00:13:12.833 --> 00:13:14.708 align:middle
Fine.

00:13:14.792 --> 00:13:16.083 align:middle
You're a handsome kid.

00:13:16.167 --> 00:13:18.333 align:middle
I'm sure a guy like
you gets all the girls.

00:13:18.417 --> 00:13:21.542 align:middle
Um. Kinda the opposite, sir.

00:13:21.625 --> 00:13:24.375 align:middle
Are you really okay
with settling for Kyoko?

00:13:24.458 --> 00:13:27.833 align:middle
Yeah, I am,
but I'm not settling.

00:13:27.917 --> 00:13:29.500 align:middle
I fell for her.

00:13:29.583 --> 00:13:30.667 align:middle
What a charmer!

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.167 align:middle
I wish I could go
back to high school!

00:13:33.917 --> 00:13:36.542 align:middle
Here! I got your bobby pins.

00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:37.750 align:middle
Now that I think about it,

00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle
you're exactly like
Yuriko was at that age.

00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:41.625 align:middle
And something
tells me you've been

00:13:41.708 --> 00:13:44.125 align:middle
an immature loser
your entire life.

00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.667 align:middle
Hi, Kyosuke.

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:56.625 align:middle
No.

00:13:56.708 --> 00:13:58.458 align:middle
Oh! It's terrible!

00:13:58.542 --> 00:13:59.750 align:middle
You're here in time for dinner,

00:13:59.833 --> 00:14:02.083 align:middle
but I don't have
enough to feed you!

00:14:02.167 --> 00:14:03.375 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
You're joking, right?

00:14:03.458 --> 00:14:07.292 align:middle
There's me, Sota,
then Kyoko, and Izumi, too.

00:14:07.375 --> 00:14:09.792 align:middle
Hey! I can solve the
problem by going home.

00:14:09.875 --> 00:14:10.917 align:middle
That's silly.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.792 align:middle
Kyosuke doesn't
even have silverware.

00:14:12.875 --> 00:14:14.708 align:middle
I don't have silverware anymore?

00:14:14.792 --> 00:14:17.167 align:middle
[YURIKO] We have takeout
chopsticks you can use.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.125 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
I don't have chopsticks, either?

00:14:21.583 --> 00:14:24.875 align:middle
[HORI] I should apologize
for how annoying Kyosuke was.

00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.042 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
It's okay.

00:14:26.125 --> 00:14:27.167 align:middle
[HORI]
You're too nice.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.708 align:middle
I know firsthand
how pushy he can be.

00:14:29.792 --> 00:14:31.333 align:middle
[laughs]

00:14:31.417 --> 00:14:33.333 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] Somehow,
him being a Hori kind of

00:14:33.417 --> 00:14:35.167 align:middle
justifies his behavior.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.750 align:middle
[HORI]
Miyamura?

00:14:44.833 --> 00:14:46.583 align:middle
Something on your mind?

00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:05.333 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
So, listen. Hori.

00:15:05.417 --> 00:15:07.667 align:middle
When it comes to
knowing the real you,

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.292 align:middle
I feel like I've barely
scratched the surface.

00:15:10.375 --> 00:15:12.417 align:middle
But, if you'll let me,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.208 align:middle
I'd like to learn everything,
little by little.

00:15:16.292 --> 00:15:19.375 align:middle
At least,
that's the hope I have.

00:15:21.208 --> 00:15:23.125 align:middle
Well, the feeling's mutual.

00:15:23.208 --> 00:15:24.208 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
It is?

00:15:24.292 --> 00:15:25.708 align:middle
[HORI]
Yeah.

00:15:26.667 --> 00:15:28.667 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I can make it from here.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle
[HORI]
Okay. Be careful.

00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:34.042 align:middle
I'll, uh, see you tomorrow.

00:15:34.125 --> 00:15:37.167 align:middle
Hori!

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle
Thank you.

00:15:40.125 --> 00:15:41.833 align:middle
You're welcome.

00:15:51.167 --> 00:15:53.500 align:middle
[groans]

00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:01.167 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] Now I know
how hard it is to say,

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.625 align:middle
"See you tomorrow."

00:16:03.708 --> 00:16:06.583 align:middle
And just how fast
your heart can beat.

00:16:08.917 --> 00:16:10.167 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Yeah.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.208 align:middle
So how many problems
did we have for Math again?

00:16:13.292 --> 00:16:20.083 align:middle
Hm? Oh. Wow. Yeah. 'Course.

00:16:20.167 --> 00:16:21.500 align:middle
Don't be stupid.

00:16:21.583 --> 00:16:23.333 align:middle
I'm the one who
called you, remember?

00:16:23.417 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle
Seriously, don't stress.

00:16:25.583 --> 00:16:26.792 align:middle
You made it happen.

00:16:26.875 --> 00:16:28.000 align:middle
That's awesome.

00:16:28.083 --> 00:16:29.458 align:middle
I'm cool with it.

00:16:29.542 --> 00:16:32.417 align:middle
Yeah, I'll see you at school.

00:16:34.917 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle
[sighs]

00:16:43.167 --> 00:16:46.292 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Aw, crap.

00:16:46.375 --> 00:16:51.208 align:middle
So lame. I was
the one closest to her.

00:16:51.292 --> 00:16:53.875 align:middle
What the actual hell?

00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.583 align:middle
This sucks.

00:16:58.542 --> 00:16:59.958 align:middle
[STUDENT A]
Maybe I'll get a part-time job!

00:17:00.042 --> 00:17:02.500 align:middle
[STUDENT B]
Ooh! Apply where I work!

00:17:08.708 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle
[KONO] For some reason--he
seems kind of down.

00:17:11.583 --> 00:17:16.458 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
There you are! Sakura? Hello!

00:17:16.542 --> 00:17:18.500 align:middle
It's not like you
to be a space case.

00:17:18.583 --> 00:17:20.333 align:middle
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:17:20.417 --> 00:17:22.875 align:middle
I'm as down to earth as ever!

00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:26.042 align:middle
Let's head for
the council room, okay?

00:17:26.125 --> 00:17:27.583 align:middle
What was out that window?

00:17:27.667 --> 00:17:29.583 align:middle
[KONO]
Nothing! Just drop it!

00:17:29.667 --> 00:17:32.250 align:middle
[AYASAKI] Yeah, right! Remi can
tell your eyes were occupied!

00:17:32.333 --> 00:17:33.875 align:middle
[KONO]
I promise you they weren't.

00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.875 align:middle
So let's get going already.

00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.708 align:middle
Come on!

00:17:37.792 --> 00:17:39.833 align:middle
Is it something you
need to hide from me?

00:17:39.917 --> 00:17:41.542 align:middle
[gasps]

00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:43.958 align:middle
Lately, you've been
acting really weird.

00:17:44.042 --> 00:17:45.583 align:middle
[KONO]
That's not true.

00:17:45.667 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle
Yeah-huh!
Just now, you zoned out!

00:17:48.083 --> 00:17:50.083 align:middle
So what's going on with you?

00:17:50.167 --> 00:17:51.667 align:middle
Remi's willing to listen.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.208 align:middle
No judgment!

00:17:57.625 --> 00:17:59.750 align:middle
[KONO]
Such big eyes.

00:17:59.833 --> 00:18:02.292 align:middle
And her slender figure
is the same as Hori's.

00:18:02.375 --> 00:18:04.417 align:middle
I'm sure that's Ishikawa's type.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle
Someone both pretty and cute.

00:18:08.083 --> 00:18:09.458 align:middle
You wouldn't understand.

00:18:09.542 --> 00:18:10.333 align:middle
Huh?

00:18:10.417 --> 00:18:12.000 align:middle
What would make you say that?

00:18:12.083 --> 00:18:13.958 align:middle
You think I'm too
stupid or something?

00:18:14.042 --> 00:18:17.292 align:middle
--Is that why?
--[KONO] No! Of course not!

00:18:17.375 --> 00:18:18.750 align:middle
It's because...

00:18:18.833 --> 00:18:21.708 align:middle
How can you empathize when
you look as cute as you do?

00:18:21.792 --> 00:18:24.333 align:middle
You don't know what
it's like to be me.

00:18:25.458 --> 00:18:27.500 align:middle
What the hell?

00:18:27.583 --> 00:18:29.583 align:middle
Remi is genuinely
concerned about you!

00:18:29.667 --> 00:18:33.125 align:middle
[KONO] And I genuinely
meant what I said!

00:18:33.208 --> 00:18:37.167 align:middle
I wish things were different.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.625 align:middle
In fact, I wish I could be you!

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:49.333 align:middle
[KONO] I'm as ugly on the
inside as I am on the outside.

00:18:49.417 --> 00:18:50.792 align:middle
How pitiful.

00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:52.667 align:middle
[STUDENT C] Why is
somebody as hot as Ayasaki

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle
always hanging around Kono?

00:18:54.583 --> 00:18:56.667 align:middle
They're like Beauty
and the Beast!

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.292 align:middle
[KONO]
I know I'll never be a beauty.

00:18:59.375 --> 00:19:02.125 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
Sakura! What a cute name!

00:19:02.208 --> 00:19:03.708 align:middle
I like it!

00:19:05.167 --> 00:19:08.667 align:middle
[KONO] That's right!
I don't need to be!

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.083 align:middle
Because the beauty's
my best friend!

00:19:24.792 --> 00:19:26.125 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
Feeling better?

00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:27.042 align:middle
Oh!

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:28.667 align:middle
I went to the bathroom.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.833 align:middle
Guess you're still uneasy, huh?

00:19:33.833 --> 00:19:35.000 align:middle
[KONO]
Okay.

00:19:35.083 --> 00:19:38.833 align:middle
So you know how you said
I've been acting weird?

00:19:38.917 --> 00:19:41.875 align:middle
There's this guy I like.

00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:44.792 align:middle
But the thing is,
I'm not attractive like you are,

00:19:44.875 --> 00:19:47.750 align:middle
and I'm painfully
aware of that fact.

00:19:47.833 --> 00:19:49.208 align:middle
I don't know--

00:19:49.292 --> 00:19:51.875 align:middle
I've never seen
you blush before!

00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:54.542 align:middle
I mean, you're always
calm and level-headed,

00:19:54.625 --> 00:19:57.375 align:middle
so you don't often lose
your composure, but...

00:19:57.458 --> 00:20:00.708 align:middle
...a little color in your
cheeks makes you look cute!

00:20:05.917 --> 00:20:08.542 align:middle
[KONO]
Thank you, Remi.

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:12.333 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA] What? You need me
to hold your hand or something?

00:20:12.417 --> 00:20:14.708 align:middle
No! But it'll only take a sec!

00:20:14.792 --> 00:20:15.667 align:middle
Huh?

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.583 align:middle
--Huh?
--Huh?

00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:20.417 align:middle
Hold up. What are
you two still doing here?

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.917 align:middle
[IURA]
I forgot something.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle
[HORI]
Same with you?

00:20:23.083 --> 00:20:25.167 align:middle
I didn't; I'm just
doing Shu a solid.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.417 align:middle
[IURA]
Since you're here, Hori,

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.792 align:middle
I have a question
about the English midterm.

00:20:28.875 --> 00:20:30.250 align:middle
[HORI]
What?

00:20:30.333 --> 00:20:31.667 align:middle
[IURA] How do I conjugate
that one grammar form again?

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.250 align:middle
[HORI]
Try to remember.

00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:34.750 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA] Don't tell me that
you're feeling awkward, dude.

00:20:34.833 --> 00:20:37.208 align:middle
[gasps]

00:20:37.292 --> 00:20:39.958 align:middle
Maybe a little. I'm so sor--

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.958 align:middle
Didn't I tell you not
to stress about this?

00:20:43.042 --> 00:20:45.917 align:middle
Get it through
your thick skull. Moron.

00:20:48.833 --> 00:20:50.333 align:middle
[MIYAMURA chuckles]

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:51.333 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
What's so funny?

00:20:51.417 --> 00:20:52.208 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Ow!

00:20:52.292 --> 00:20:53.125 align:middle
[IURA]
Jeez, you guys.

00:20:53.208 --> 00:20:54.792 align:middle
Get a room.

00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:56.500 align:middle
[HORI]
Gross.

00:20:56.583 --> 00:20:58.500 align:middle
Are you serious with
this answer right now?

00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:00.625 align:middle
I swear, you're worse than Iura.

00:21:00.708 --> 00:21:03.333 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] Unless
it's a verb ending in I-N-G,

00:21:03.417 --> 00:21:05.708 align:middle
I'm most likely
gonna screw it up.

00:21:05.792 --> 00:21:07.458 align:middle
Five o'clock already?

00:21:07.542 --> 00:21:08.625 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Is that bad?

00:21:08.708 --> 00:21:11.375 align:middle
[HORI]
No. Just expecting a guest.

00:21:11.458 --> 00:21:12.375 align:middle
Izumi.

00:21:12.458 --> 00:21:13.833 align:middle
What's up?

00:21:18.625 --> 00:21:21.333 align:middle
[laughs]

00:21:21.417 --> 00:21:22.375 align:middle
What?

00:21:22.458 --> 00:21:24.250 align:middle
[HORI]
I didn't mean you, Miyamura!

00:21:24.333 --> 00:21:25.833 align:middle
That's pretty hilarious, though!

00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:28.042 align:middle
Wait. But, you said...

00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:29.667 align:middle
[HORI]
I meant Sota's friend.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.250 align:middle
His last name is "Izumi."

00:21:31.333 --> 00:21:33.542 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Ah, I gotcha.

00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:34.625 align:middle
And here I thought
you were gonna

00:21:34.708 --> 00:21:36.917 align:middle
start calling me
by my first name.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.833 align:middle
So, what?

00:21:37.917 --> 00:21:39.542 align:middle
Is that what you want?

00:21:39.625 --> 00:21:41.542 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Yeah.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.208 align:middle
Kinda.

00:21:45.292 --> 00:21:46.958 align:middle
Why is it anytime
you get flustered now

00:21:47.042 --> 00:21:48.292 align:middle
I feel it twice as much?

00:21:48.375 --> 00:21:52.125 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Guess I didn't realize. My bad.

00:21:54.333 --> 00:21:57.375 align:middle
[HORI]
Dummy. Dummy Izumi.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.458 align:middle
You know,
I liked the sound of that,

00:22:05.542 --> 00:22:08.792 align:middle
but maybe next time,
try it without the "dummy."

00:22:10.833 --> 00:22:12.333 align:middle
[SOTA]
We're he--

00:22:12.417 --> 00:22:14.125 align:middle
[HORI] Why do you always have
to open your big, dumb mouth?

00:22:14.208 --> 00:22:15.458 align:middle
Sounds like they're at it again.

00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:16.958 align:middle
[IZUMI]
This is normal?

00:22:17.042 --> 00:22:18.667 align:middle
Your family might
need some help.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.917 align:middle
[HORI] I mean it, you dummy,
dummy, dummy, dummy!
