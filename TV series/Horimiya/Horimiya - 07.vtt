[CLERK]
Welcome!

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.083 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Hmm...

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:33.750 align:middle
[HORI] You find what
you were looking for?

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.625 align:middle
No. I could find it
online I bet.

00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:37.917 align:middle
Easy.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.833 align:middle
[HORI] Or you could
ask a clerk to help.

00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:41.917 align:middle
Nah. There's no need.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.208 align:middle
I'm independent.

00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:45.625 align:middle
[HORI]
'Kay. I'm gonna go buy this.

00:00:45.708 --> 00:00:47.083 align:middle
You're checking out?

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:48.833 align:middle
I found something I want, too.

00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:50.667 align:middle
I'll come with you.

00:00:58.583 --> 00:00:59.792 align:middle
Uh...

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:04.542 align:middle
Tag!

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:05.708 align:middle
Ow!

00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:06.958 align:middle
Know what they got over there?

00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:09.250 align:middle
A huge treasure trove
of gaming magazines!

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.833 align:middle
Let's go!

00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:13.667 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Hm.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.000 align:middle
Sure.

00:02:45.917 --> 00:02:47.417 align:middle
Toru!

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.125 align:middle
Huh? What's up? Trash duty?

00:02:51.208 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle
Yeah. You grab the burnables.

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:55.375 align:middle
Do I have to?

00:02:55.458 --> 00:02:56.917 align:middle
It weighs a ton!

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.167 align:middle
And just like that,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.542 align:middle
your ulterior motives
are brought to light.

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:00.708 align:middle
Real smooth.

00:03:00.792 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle
Why, whatever
could you mean, my friend?

00:03:06.292 --> 00:03:07.375 align:middle
Oh, that's right!

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:08.500 align:middle
Today's the day.

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:10.125 align:middle
It's finally on DVD.

00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:11.792 align:middle
Wanna come with me
to get a copy?

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:13.125 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Uh...

00:03:13.208 --> 00:03:15.958 align:middle
How 'bout I let you
borrow it as a reward?

00:03:16.042 --> 00:03:19.625 align:middle
The actor who plays
the shopkeeper is mega hot!

00:03:19.708 --> 00:03:21.917 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA] Ever since Hori
and Miyamura started dating,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.042 align:middle
I've become the center
of Yoshikawa's attention.

00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:26.375 align:middle
Did you tune me out?

00:03:26.458 --> 00:03:28.542 align:middle
Nah, I heard you loud and clear.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.583 align:middle
Plus, I don't think
I could ignore you if--

00:03:36.792 --> 00:03:38.292 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Ah! Oh, no!

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.375 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
You okay? I am so sorry!

00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:42.250 align:middle
[KONO]
Don't be!

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:44.833 align:middle
I was the one who ran into you.

00:03:44.917 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle
[KONO]
How embarrassing.

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:48.583 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
I'll be right back.

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:50.208 align:middle
So, please don't
go anywhere, okay?

00:03:50.292 --> 00:03:52.333 align:middle
Um... Sure.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.167 align:middle
We really should've been
watching where we were going.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.208 align:middle
No. Don't be silly.

00:03:59.292 --> 00:04:01.667 align:middle
I hope it doesn't leave
a stain on your shirt.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.667 align:middle
It just had to be tea.

00:04:05.083 --> 00:04:07.208 align:middle
[KONO]
I've been wondering something.

00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:08.333 align:middle
Huh?

00:04:08.417 --> 00:04:09.500 align:middle
[KONO]
Are...

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:13.125 align:middle
Are you and Ishikawa
dating, by chance?

00:04:13.208 --> 00:04:14.208 align:middle
We're definitely not.

00:04:14.292 --> 00:04:17.000 align:middle
Funny we come off
that way, though.

00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:18.500 align:middle
I see.

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:23.542 align:middle
[approaching footsteps]

00:04:23.625 --> 00:04:25.958 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA pants]
And I'm back.

00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:28.833 align:middle
I didn't want you wearing
a dirty outfit home.

00:04:28.917 --> 00:04:30.292 align:middle
So here.

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle
I figured Yoshikawa's are
probably too small for you.

00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:36.042 align:middle
My clothes'll be big, but
they're better than nothing.

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:38.292 align:middle
Sorry again!

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:39.583 align:middle
[gasps]

00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle
You're giving me this to wear?

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle
Oh! Why the heck
did I bring mine

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:44.875 align:middle
when I could've just
gone and grabbed yours?

00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:45.833 align:middle
[KONO]
It's fine!

00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:47.375 align:middle
So, uh, thank you!

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:49.167 align:middle
I'll borrow yours!

00:04:55.708 --> 00:04:59.417 align:middle
[SENGOKU] What's with
the oversized jacket?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.708 align:middle
It's a long story.

00:05:01.792 --> 00:05:02.792 align:middle
Where's Remi?

00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:03.917 align:middle
She left.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.542 align:middle
Had to head home early,

00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:09.375 align:middle
but she did stop by
to open the window.

00:05:10.833 --> 00:05:12.167 align:middle
[KONO]
Nice to see she's staying on top

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.875 align:middle
of her window-opening
responsibility.

00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:19.292 align:middle
Hey, Sengoku, what exactly
is it you like about her?

00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:20.958 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
Uh...

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:23.833 align:middle
It's hard to believe you of
all people are asking me that!

00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:26.292 align:middle
Why? It seems like
a normal question to me!

00:05:26.375 --> 00:05:28.792 align:middle
Well, normal's subjective.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.125 align:middle
Guess I like
how dependent she is.

00:05:38.208 --> 00:05:40.667 align:middle
She's not very strong,
so she needs me around.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.875 align:middle
That's why.

00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.083 align:middle
You like having a
weak girl by your side

00:05:44.167 --> 00:05:46.125 align:middle
because it makes you
feel stronger in comparison?

00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:47.542 align:middle
Hey, don't get it twisted!

00:05:47.625 --> 00:05:49.167 align:middle
I don't control her or anything!

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.167 align:middle
I just have this urge
to protect her!

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.042 align:middle
I can't really explain it.

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:59.083 align:middle
But I have this powerful
inclination to keep her safe.

00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:02.083 align:middle
And I like that feeling.

00:06:02.167 --> 00:06:04.875 align:middle
I'm not a very strong
person to begin with.

00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.208 align:middle
But for her sake,

00:06:06.292 --> 00:06:08.125 align:middle
I want to become the
strongest I've ever been,

00:06:08.208 --> 00:06:10.333 align:middle
despite all my limitations.

00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:12.833 align:middle
Remi's support helps me
find that strength.

00:06:12.917 --> 00:06:14.333 align:middle
Though it's very give-and-take.

00:06:14.417 --> 00:06:16.167 align:middle
Not a one-way street.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.458 align:middle
I push her as much
as she pushes me.

00:06:19.542 --> 00:06:22.208 align:middle
So, she's the one
protecting me in the end.

00:06:22.292 --> 00:06:23.583 align:middle
Ironic.

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:26.333 align:middle
Kinda like how she looks out
for you, right, Sakura?

00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:33.917 align:middle
A little color in your
cheeks makes you look cute!

00:06:36.917 --> 00:06:38.875 align:middle
Yeah. I know what you mean now.

00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.333 align:middle
Thank you.

00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.375 align:middle
[KONO] Remi has a way of
giving me courage, too.

00:06:49.667 --> 00:06:51.417 align:middle
[KONO]
It's the push I need.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.375 align:middle
The push to make me
try a tiny bit harder.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle
[STUDENT BB]
Glad that's over with.

00:06:58.083 --> 00:06:59.000 align:middle
[STUDENT CC]
You got any plans after school?

00:06:59.083 --> 00:07:01.000 align:middle
[KONO]
I-Ishikawa?

00:07:01.083 --> 00:07:04.250 align:middle
Hey there. How goes?

00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:06.750 align:middle
Thanks for lending me this.

00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:07.792 align:middle
Sorry for the wait.

00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:08.917 align:middle
I wanted to run it
through the wash

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.292 align:middle
before I gave it back to you.

00:07:10.375 --> 00:07:11.750 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Awww, thanks but,

00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:12.708 align:middle
you didn't have
to go out of your way

00:07:12.792 --> 00:07:14.667 align:middle
and do something like that!

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.958 align:middle
[KONO] I just wanted to show you
the same courtesy you showed me.

00:07:17.042 --> 00:07:18.667 align:middle
[IURA] Ishikawa!
Dude, c'mere real quick!

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle
Coming!

00:07:20.583 --> 00:07:22.250 align:middle
Bye.

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:24.375 align:middle
Uh...!

00:07:24.458 --> 00:07:25.750 align:middle
Hang on!

00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:34.333 align:middle
I... I wound up making
too many cookies.

00:07:34.417 --> 00:07:36.125 align:middle
Please, uh...

00:07:36.208 --> 00:07:38.292 align:middle
What? Cookies?

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.458 align:middle
So are you saying
those are for me?

00:07:40.542 --> 00:07:42.542 align:middle
[KONO]
Yes! I hope you like them!

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.917 align:middle
Yo! These rock!

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.958 align:middle
Holy cow!

00:07:48.042 --> 00:07:49.708 align:middle
That <i>sakura</i> one was way-good!

00:07:49.792 --> 00:07:52.292 align:middle
Might just be my favorite!

00:07:54.083 --> 00:07:55.625 align:middle
[KONO]
Do you like <i>sakura</i> ?

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle
<i>Sakura</i> ? Yeah, 'course I do!

00:07:58.833 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle
[IURA]
Ishikawa!

00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:01.125 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Calming breaths, dude.

00:08:01.208 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle
Sorry to rush!

00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:05.708 align:middle
Oh, and I'm officially
in love with these.

00:08:05.792 --> 00:08:07.458 align:middle
So please make more!

00:08:07.542 --> 00:08:08.625 align:middle
[IURA]
Took you long enough!

00:08:08.708 --> 00:08:10.083 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Gimme a break!

00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:11.458 align:middle
[exhales]

00:08:13.417 --> 00:08:14.583 align:middle
[giggles]

00:08:16.917 --> 00:08:17.750 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Ah!

00:08:17.833 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle
How lucky!

00:08:19.083 --> 00:08:21.125 align:middle
I snagged the last volume--

00:08:31.208 --> 00:08:32.667 align:middle
[HORI]
Yuki, what gives?

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.833 align:middle
You and I both know you've
been looking for that.

00:08:34.917 --> 00:08:37.292 align:middle
Heh. It's cool.

00:08:37.375 --> 00:08:40.208 align:middle
I think that girl
wanted it more than I did.

00:08:40.292 --> 00:08:41.792 align:middle
I'll eventually get one.

00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:43.125 align:middle
It's no biggie.

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:47.792 align:middle
Ishikawa! Got a visitor!

00:08:47.875 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Coming!

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.250 align:middle
Hey, so...

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:55.958 align:middle
I noticed that you and Toru
don't seem as close these days.

00:08:56.042 --> 00:08:57.667 align:middle
There a reason for that, or...?

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.042 align:middle
Yeah, well,

00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:00.333 align:middle
why would he spend time with me

00:09:00.417 --> 00:09:02.833 align:middle
when he could be off
eating cookies somewhere?

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.250 align:middle
[HORI]
What's that supposed to mean?

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:13.125 align:middle
[HORI] I've only known
Yuki for three years,

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:14.917 align:middle
but she's like
an open book to me.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.917 align:middle
Oh, yeah!

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.375 align:middle
Next period is
study hall for us!

00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:20.375 align:middle
Sweet-ness.

00:09:20.458 --> 00:09:22.250 align:middle
[HORI]
The more upset she is deep down,

00:09:22.333 --> 00:09:25.042 align:middle
the bigger her smile gets.

00:09:25.125 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle
Even when she desperately
wants something,

00:09:27.083 --> 00:09:28.292 align:middle
she won't admit it.

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:29.750 align:middle
And if the words "I want this"

00:09:29.833 --> 00:09:32.167 align:middle
or "I love this"
do manage to get out,

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.333 align:middle
she never says them
with all her heart.

00:09:39.417 --> 00:09:42.458 align:middle
[HORI] As a result, the
things Yuki wants or loves

00:09:42.542 --> 00:09:44.708 align:middle
tend to slip out of her reach.

00:09:48.583 --> 00:09:51.000 align:middle
[KONO] I appreciate you
lending me your handkerchief

00:09:51.083 --> 00:09:53.375 align:middle
and made these to say thanks.

00:09:54.708 --> 00:09:57.250 align:middle
--I'm okay.
--[KONO] Huh?

00:09:57.333 --> 00:09:58.583 align:middle
Oh, no way! Cookies?

00:09:58.667 --> 00:10:00.375 align:middle
That's like a
top three best snack!

00:10:00.458 --> 00:10:03.083 align:middle
Wow! Thank you
for the thank you!

00:10:03.167 --> 00:10:04.542 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
They really are bomb, Kono!

00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:05.750 align:middle
That's sweet of you to say.

00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:07.125 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
And I'll say it again,

00:10:07.208 --> 00:10:08.333 align:middle
'cause they're frickin' good!

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.333 align:middle
To say thanks.

00:10:29.375 --> 00:10:31.042 align:middle
Not bad.

00:10:31.125 --> 00:10:34.208 align:middle
I might as well eat them
if they ended up this tasty.

00:10:38.625 --> 00:10:40.583 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
How pathetic can I get?

00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:44.083 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Huh? A cake?

00:10:44.167 --> 00:10:45.625 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Yeah.

00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:48.917 align:middle
I could use the help since
I've never made one before.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.833 align:middle
It doesn't have to be
super fancy or anything

00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:52.292 align:middle
so long as it tastes yummy.

00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:55.875 align:middle
But even that might be
setting my standards too high.

00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.542 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
You know, Yoshikawa.

00:10:57.625 --> 00:11:00.583 align:middle
I wasn't born with the
natural ability to bake.

00:11:00.667 --> 00:11:02.458 align:middle
It came with practice.

00:11:02.542 --> 00:11:05.792 align:middle
Nobody is perfect at
something right off the bat.

00:11:05.875 --> 00:11:09.208 align:middle
If you mess up,
just give it another shot.

00:11:11.417 --> 00:11:12.750 align:middle
Right!

00:11:17.167 --> 00:11:19.000 align:middle
Wow.

00:11:19.083 --> 00:11:22.208 align:middle
It took you seven days
to bake these?

00:11:22.292 --> 00:11:23.792 align:middle
So, um...

00:11:23.875 --> 00:11:25.792 align:middle
They're cupcakes, right?

00:11:25.875 --> 00:11:26.875 align:middle
If you can't
even tell that much,

00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.292 align:middle
then they're worse
than I thought!

00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:29.542 align:middle
I'm confused.

00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:31.667 align:middle
Why're you keeping
your new hobby from Toru?

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.583 align:middle
Because he'd make fun of me, and
I don't need that aggravation!

00:11:34.667 --> 00:11:36.125 align:middle
I don't think he would.

00:11:36.208 --> 00:11:38.500 align:middle
Especially if he knew
that you were baking for him.

00:11:38.583 --> 00:11:39.667 align:middle
These aren't for Toru!

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle
What're you, crazy?

00:11:41.083 --> 00:11:42.375 align:middle
Hey. There you are!

00:11:43.875 --> 00:11:46.375 align:middle
Havin' a rooftop party,
and you didn't invite me?

00:11:46.458 --> 00:11:48.250 align:middle
Don't you dare look!

00:11:52.083 --> 00:11:53.792 align:middle
Is this a cupcake?

00:11:53.875 --> 00:11:55.792 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Give it back!

00:12:00.042 --> 00:12:01.917 align:middle
Ugh. It tastes disgusting.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.583 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Excuse you!

00:12:03.667 --> 00:12:05.292 align:middle
Like, pure awful.

00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:08.333 align:middle
I know. Good grief.

00:12:08.417 --> 00:12:10.167 align:middle
I can't wait for the next!

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.500 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:12:11.583 --> 00:12:13.375 align:middle
[gasps]

00:12:13.458 --> 00:12:15.042 align:middle
Same here!

00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:16.792 align:middle
Yeah, me, too!

00:12:18.542 --> 00:12:20.000 align:middle
I'm all over it.

00:12:23.625 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle
[sighs]

00:12:27.917 --> 00:12:31.792 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA] So, Miyamura's absent
today--because he's in Hokkaido?

00:12:31.875 --> 00:12:33.208 align:middle
[HORI]
Yeah.

00:12:33.292 --> 00:12:36.208 align:middle
He's visiting family up
there for a memorial service.

00:12:36.292 --> 00:12:37.667 align:middle
Five whole days.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:40.625 align:middle
Which means he's gonna miss
an entire week of school.

00:12:40.708 --> 00:12:42.167 align:middle
Wait a second.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.583 align:middle
I'll have to read different
lines out loud if he's not here!

00:12:44.667 --> 00:12:46.208 align:middle
So which line was his?

00:12:46.292 --> 00:12:47.958 align:middle
I think it was
the fifth one, wasn't it?

00:12:48.042 --> 00:12:49.125 align:middle
Dang it, Miyamura!

00:12:49.208 --> 00:12:50.708 align:middle
Mine's long now!

00:12:50.792 --> 00:12:52.042 align:middle
And mine is way easier!

00:12:52.125 --> 00:12:54.292 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA] Then help me
translate this, Yoshikawa!

00:12:57.875 --> 00:13:00.167 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Made it to Hokkaido.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.208 align:middle
It's a whole lot cooler.

00:13:01.292 --> 00:13:03.167 align:middle
Just the weather, though.

00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:06.292 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
My battery's almost dead.

00:13:07.792 --> 00:13:11.542 align:middle
Don't tell me I left
my charger at home.

00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:12.583 align:middle
Hey, Uncle?

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:13.875 align:middle
Do you have a spare charger?

00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:14.792 align:middle
For my phone?

00:13:14.875 --> 00:13:16.958 align:middle
Sure. If they're compatible...

00:13:17.042 --> 00:13:18.375 align:middle
Oh. Right.

00:13:20.625 --> 00:13:22.000 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
That's a no.

00:13:26.667 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle
Can we go to the
convenience store?

00:13:28.333 --> 00:13:30.083 align:middle
I've got my hands
tied cleaning up.

00:13:30.167 --> 00:13:33.375 align:middle
I'm sorry, honey, but I can't
drive you anywhere right now.

00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:36.125 align:middle
Whatever you need,
I'm sure you can get it later.

00:13:42.458 --> 00:13:44.125 align:middle
Are you gonna drink two?

00:13:44.208 --> 00:13:47.292 align:middle
Yeah, uh,
I'm super thirsty today.

00:13:47.375 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle
That's one way to stay
hydrated in this heat!

00:13:50.083 --> 00:13:51.792 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA] That sugary stuff
doesn't hydrate you.

00:13:51.875 --> 00:13:53.000 align:middle
Just makes you fat.

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:54.708 align:middle
Just three more days.

00:14:10.042 --> 00:14:11.583 align:middle
[STUDENT F]
See you tomorrow, Hori!

00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:13.667 align:middle
[HORI]
Yeah, see ya!

00:14:15.625 --> 00:14:16.875 align:middle
[sighs]

00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.042 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
Are you waiting for someone?

00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:19.875 align:middle
Huh? Why would I be?

00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle
Bye!

00:14:26.792 --> 00:14:27.750 align:middle
Kyoko.

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:29.333 align:middle
That's not my bowl, sweetheart.

00:14:29.417 --> 00:14:31.167 align:middle
[SOTA]
'Course not! It's my bro's!

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.958 align:middle
[KYOSUKE] What? You trying
to trigger me or something?

00:14:33.042 --> 00:14:34.958 align:middle
Surprisingly, no!

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:36.542 align:middle
I made a mistake is all.

00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:39.542 align:middle
[KYOSUKE] Sota. Check 'n' see if
there are pigs flying outside.

00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:42.500 align:middle
Ahh...!

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.792 align:middle
[HORI groans]

00:15:01.292 --> 00:15:04.125 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA] Ooh! Today's
the day Miyamura comes back!

00:15:04.208 --> 00:15:05.750 align:middle
Will he get in by dinner time?

00:15:05.833 --> 00:15:07.792 align:middle
Or nah?

00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:12.208 align:middle
I have no idea.

00:15:12.292 --> 00:15:13.917 align:middle
[SOTA]
You're killin' me, Sissy!

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.458 align:middle
<i>Hurricane Star</i> already started
and you're making me miss it!

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle
[KYOSUKE] Didn't realize
you were such a news buff.

00:15:19.833 --> 00:15:22.458 align:middle
[NEWSCASTER] Our next story
tonight: delays at airports

00:15:22.542 --> 00:15:25.417 align:middle
caused by further
carry-on restrictions.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.792 align:middle
Hormones. Amirite?

00:15:34.792 --> 00:15:36.458 align:middle
Wait. Kyoko!

00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:44.958 align:middle
And it's back.

00:15:45.042 --> 00:15:47.333 align:middle
Shindo. Shindo. Ishikawa says.

00:15:47.417 --> 00:15:48.750 align:middle
The big test got postponed.

00:15:48.833 --> 00:15:51.542 align:middle
That sucks. I actually studied.

00:15:55.625 --> 00:15:57.542 align:middle
[IORI]
Izumi?

00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:21.625 align:middle
Oh. 'Scuse me.

00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:34.917 align:middle
You're here.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.625 align:middle
Dummy.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.667 align:middle
Up until that point,

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.667 align:middle
I never knew how long
five days could feel.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.000 align:middle
I'm glad that you're home.

00:16:51.083 --> 00:16:53.250 align:middle
Um! Yeah. Thanks.

00:16:53.333 --> 00:16:55.125 align:middle
Good to see you.

00:16:55.208 --> 00:16:59.125 align:middle
[HORI] Now I know that
time apart can be torture.

00:17:06.167 --> 00:17:08.250 align:middle
Something Miyamura doesn't like?

00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:11.083 align:middle
That would have
to be horror movies.

00:17:11.167 --> 00:17:13.833 align:middle
Though, he's not opposed
to marathoning them with me.

00:17:13.917 --> 00:17:16.042 align:middle
So maybe he's cool
with 'em after all.

00:17:16.125 --> 00:17:17.833 align:middle
[ALL 3]
Or he's enduring them for you.

00:17:17.917 --> 00:17:19.083 align:middle
A few words of advice?

00:17:19.167 --> 00:17:21.458 align:middle
Ditch the scary stuff
before he ditches you.

00:17:21.542 --> 00:17:22.792 align:middle
It's only a matter of time.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.292 align:middle
Huh?

00:17:24.375 --> 00:17:25.792 align:middle
Plus, cute girls finding glee

00:17:25.875 --> 00:17:28.917 align:middle
from watching slasher flicks
is a special kind of creepy.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.500 align:middle
[HORI]
I'm not that cute.

00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:32.375 align:middle
Come on, ladies.

00:17:32.458 --> 00:17:35.250 align:middle
Hori. You're missing
the entire point.

00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:37.833 align:middle
[AYASAKI] Remi has to agree
with Yoshikawa on this one.

00:17:37.917 --> 00:17:40.417 align:middle
That sounds like
a total turnoff.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.458 align:middle
Huh. I guess.

00:17:46.542 --> 00:17:49.375 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] I brought a movie
for us to watch tonight.

00:17:49.458 --> 00:17:50.583 align:middle
It's got doggos!

00:17:50.667 --> 00:17:52.333 align:middle
So what do you say?

00:17:52.417 --> 00:17:54.708 align:middle
Or, let's watch <i>Right Behind</i>
<i>You: The Third Nightmare</i> .

00:17:54.792 --> 00:17:57.042 align:middle
Yes, let's.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.500 align:middle
You need to ditch
the scary stuff

00:18:00.583 --> 00:18:01.750 align:middle
before he ditches you.

00:18:01.833 --> 00:18:03.625 align:middle
It's only a matter of time.

00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:06.542 align:middle
So, um...
I'm kinda nervous.

00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:08.875 align:middle
This movie might
get pretty hairy.

00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.458 align:middle
Hope I can hack it.

00:18:10.542 --> 00:18:12.125 align:middle
I think you'll
hack it just fine.

00:18:12.208 --> 00:18:13.542 align:middle
Compared to the
gorefests we've watched

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:16.208 align:middle
on our past movie nights,
this should be a cakewalk.

00:18:16.292 --> 00:18:17.833 align:middle
You're a professional.

00:18:17.917 --> 00:18:19.208 align:middle
[HORI]
Strike one!

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.792 align:middle
Pretend to be afraid
so he can comfort you!

00:18:25.333 --> 00:18:26.708 align:middle
So scary!

00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:29.667 align:middle
You scared the pants off me!

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.042 align:middle
[HORI]
There goes strike two!

00:18:32.125 --> 00:18:34.167 align:middle
Maybe this tactic's
a lost cause.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.458 align:middle
You could always
give handholding

00:18:35.542 --> 00:18:36.958 align:middle
during the movie a try.

00:18:37.042 --> 00:18:38.458 align:middle
[gasps]

00:18:38.542 --> 00:18:41.250 align:middle
[HORI]
I... I sure am petrified.

00:18:41.333 --> 00:18:43.625 align:middle
[screaming]

00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:50.083 align:middle
[HORI] All I wanna do is
enjoy a movie with him.

00:18:50.167 --> 00:18:51.917 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I'm sorry I'm such a wimp.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.083 align:middle
I really am.

00:18:53.167 --> 00:18:55.375 align:middle
It's nothing you have
to apologize for!

00:18:55.458 --> 00:18:57.500 align:middle
Getting a little
jumpy isn't a big deal.

00:18:57.583 --> 00:19:00.167 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I know. Just gimme a sec.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.167 align:middle
I need a moment.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.583 align:middle
[HORI] No. He's gonna
dump me, isn't he?

00:19:05.667 --> 00:19:07.458 align:middle
Strike three!

00:19:07.542 --> 00:19:08.417 align:middle
[sighs]

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.625 align:middle
I'm pitiful.

00:19:09.708 --> 00:19:10.792 align:middle
[door opens and closes]

00:19:10.875 --> 00:19:12.333 align:middle
What is she doing?

00:19:16.417 --> 00:19:18.167 align:middle
You okay?

00:19:20.625 --> 00:19:23.417 align:middle
[HORI]
I'm not okay and I'm not cute.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.833 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Hey, now. You're cute.

00:19:24.917 --> 00:19:26.375 align:middle
You're very cute.

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:27.708 align:middle
[HORI]
I don't get scared.

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.583 align:middle
I can't even act scared.

00:19:29.667 --> 00:19:32.667 align:middle
I'm just a hopeless,
un-cute excuse for a human.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.667 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] So all that stuff
you pulled in the living room

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.167 align:middle
was you trying to
act more "cute" for me?

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.167 align:middle
[HORI]
Not like it matters, dummy!

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.708 align:middle
If it was, I'm sorry.

00:19:40.792 --> 00:19:43.333 align:middle
I... I was too busy
freaking out to even see.

00:19:43.417 --> 00:19:44.708 align:middle
Sorry I didn't notice you.

00:19:44.792 --> 00:19:48.083 align:middle
[HORI] Why is it that
you keep apologizing to me?

00:19:48.167 --> 00:19:49.500 align:middle
Don't look, you big dummy!

00:19:49.583 --> 00:19:52.042 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] I think you're
the big dummy this time.

00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:54.958 align:middle
I didn't fall for just
some "cute" girl, y'know.

00:19:55.042 --> 00:19:57.625 align:middle
I fell in love with you.

00:19:57.708 --> 00:19:59.292 align:middle
Let's finish the movie.

00:19:59.375 --> 00:20:02.042 align:middle
That sound like a plan?

00:20:02.125 --> 00:20:04.542 align:middle
[rain grows louder]

00:20:04.625 --> 00:20:06.833 align:middle
Oh, wow.
It's really coming down.

00:20:06.917 --> 00:20:08.708 align:middle
Yeah, sure is.

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:12.333 align:middle
[HORI]
I'm the same.

00:20:12.417 --> 00:20:14.917 align:middle
I fell for him just as hard.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.083 align:middle
I fell for his long eyelashes.

00:20:17.167 --> 00:20:19.625 align:middle
And the way he scares so easily.

00:20:19.708 --> 00:20:21.583 align:middle
I fell for his sarcastic quips,

00:20:21.667 --> 00:20:24.375 align:middle
and how his slender
frame feels in my arms.

00:20:24.458 --> 00:20:25.542 align:middle
His voice.

00:20:25.625 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle
I... I fell for...

00:20:28.583 --> 00:20:30.042 align:middle
Izumi.

00:20:43.958 --> 00:20:45.583 align:middle
What's wrong?

00:20:45.667 --> 00:20:46.625 align:middle
[HORI]
Nothing.

00:20:46.708 --> 00:20:48.708 align:middle
I'm listening to your heart.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.292 align:middle
And you can understand
what it's telling you?

00:20:57.375 --> 00:20:59.500 align:middle
It's saying how cold it is.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.500 align:middle
You're freezing.

00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:07.667 align:middle
Your hands and
ears are like ice.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.875 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Probably from the rain.

00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:11.875 align:middle
[HORI]
Probably.

00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:13.583 align:middle
There's no way
you're going home.

00:21:13.667 --> 00:21:16.458 align:middle
Not in this downpour.

00:21:17.292 --> 00:21:19.125 align:middle
[HORI]
There was a fire within me,

00:21:19.208 --> 00:21:21.625 align:middle
and I wanted Miyamura
to feel it, too.

00:21:27.083 --> 00:21:29.542 align:middle
It's you, me,
and Sissy havin' fun!

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:33.875 align:middle
What's wrong?

00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:36.958 align:middle
[SOTA]
You know, she's my big sister.

00:21:39.917 --> 00:21:41.167 align:middle
Wait a minute.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.708 align:middle
Sota, are you worried
that I'm taking her away?

00:21:43.792 --> 00:21:45.583 align:middle
[SOTA cries]

00:21:45.667 --> 00:21:46.792 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I won't.

00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:49.125 align:middle
She'll always be your big sis.

00:21:49.708 --> 00:21:50.667 align:middle
[SOTA]
And what about you?

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.375 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
What else?

00:21:52.458 --> 00:21:54.625 align:middle
I'll always be your big bro.

00:21:54.708 --> 00:21:58.083 align:middle
I promise I won't
take your sister from you.

00:21:58.167 --> 00:22:01.208 align:middle
But could I maybe have Kyoko?

00:22:01.292 --> 00:22:02.792 align:middle
[SOTA]
Okay.

00:23:34.792 --> 00:23:36.125 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Ow!

00:23:36.208 --> 00:23:38.042 align:middle
[HORI]
Your hair's growing out.

00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:41.083 align:middle
Cut it again and
everyone'll see that mark.

00:23:41.167 --> 00:23:43.083 align:middle
It's your choice.

00:23:43.167 --> 00:23:44.833 align:middle
Damn, she bit you good, bro.

00:23:44.917 --> 00:23:47.458 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] I thought she
was gonna bite my head off.

00:23:47.542 --> 00:23:49.708 align:middle
[SHINDO] Looks like
she branded the poor guy,

00:23:49.792 --> 00:23:51.208 align:middle
but I won't say that out loud.
