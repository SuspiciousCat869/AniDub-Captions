00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:15.348 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER A]
Time to partner up, class!

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:16.349 position:50% align:center
I want you to hold hands

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.643 position:50% align:center
when you've found
your one, okay?

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:20.311 position:50% align:center
[GIRL A]
Hey! Wanna be with me?

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:21.980 position:50% align:center
[GIRL B]
Sure!

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:23.982 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER A]
Has everybody paired off?

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.236 position:50% align:center
Seems we have an odd man out.

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:29.529 position:50% align:center
Hey, kids!

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:31.197 position:50% align:center
Who wants Miyamura
to be their second partner?

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:32.240 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:35.452 position:50% align:center
He's gross!
And really weird, too!

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.166 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER C] We'll be
conducting an experiment,

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:44.002 position:50% align:center
but before we do anything,
break into groups of five.

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:49.799 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT G] And melancholy
Miyamura's solo yet again.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.594 position:50% align:center
Like, I can never get
a solid read on that guy.

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:58.892 position:50% align:center
Hey! Someone
take the leftover!

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:07.359 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Yup. That sums it up.

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.282 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:26.169 position:50% align:center
School's pretty tough
in lots of ways.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.171 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B] If they gave out an
award for most depressing kid,

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:31.091 position:50% align:center
he'd win it every year.

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:32.467 position:50% align:center
Wait. Who would?

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.969 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B]
Miyamura. Duh!

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:36.763 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
I don't think I know that name.

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:39.974 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT C] Seriously? Where've
you been, under a rock?

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:41.267 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B] I heard
we're supposed to team up

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:44.979 position:50% align:center
in roster order for
this next classics report.

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:45.980 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
What're you doing?

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:48.608 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:51.069 position:50% align:center
Uh. Nothing.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:54.072 position:50% align:center
[HORI] I saw you hide
something, though.

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.700 position:50% align:center
Apparently we're
grouped up next project.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.994 position:50% align:center
Oh. Um. That's news to me.
So, uh...

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:01.538 position:50% align:center
Do you not know my name?

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.707 position:50% align:center
I feel like you should this late
in the year, but it's Hori.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.709 position:50% align:center
Ah. I'm sorry.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.711 position:50% align:center
Huh. I could've sworn
she told those girls

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.088 position:50% align:center
she didn't know my name either.

00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:13.842 position:50% align:center
Anyway. People say
you're kinda gloomy.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:15.010 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:17.595 position:50% align:center
I talked to you so
I could see for myself.

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.681 position:50% align:center
And I don't get it.

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:22.017 position:50% align:center
'Cause you seem
totally normal to me!

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:30.108 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
This Hori girl is kinda weird.

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:10.458 position:50% align:center
[HORI gasps]
I found my name!

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.836 position:50% align:center
Looks like I'm in
class one with you, Yuki!

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.421 position:50% align:center
--Yeah, awesome!
--Awesome!

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.631 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Class one,
Class one, c'mon, class one.

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:17.924 position:50% align:center
You guys find your name yet?

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:19.509 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'm class one.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:21.720 position:50% align:center
Yes! Class one for me, too!

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.013 position:50% align:center
This just goes
to show how strong

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.306 position:50% align:center
the power of love can truly be!

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
It's fate!

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.059 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Wait. Love?

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
So because they're in the same
class they have a fated love?

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT E] Is it a bromance,
or are they really dating?

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:35.650 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah!

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:38.403 position:50% align:center
We'll be together
till we graduate!

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:41.656 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
You guys find your classes yet?

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50% align:center
Yep, sure did.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.034 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Oh, gosh!

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:45.577 position:50% align:center
I don't think it's
worth crying over!

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
People are whispering.

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Then grow up and do something.

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:50.498 position:50% align:center
Take it easy.

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.584 position:50% align:center
Hit him too hard and you
might snap his poor spine.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:53.501 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
True.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, Ishikawa.

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.504 position:50% align:center
Remember that song
you gave me the other day?

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50% align:center
I accidentally deleted it, so...

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:00.133 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
What? C'mon, dude.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:02.635 position:50% align:center
Well, I was trying
to free up some storage,

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:03.762 position:50% align:center
and then poof.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.472 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Sometimes, I wonder.

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.560 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Even though I'm in this group,

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:13.730 position:50% align:center
am I actually one
of them or not?

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:18.777 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER B]
Okay. I want everybody

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.237 position:50% align:center
to split into groups of
four for this next project.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and team up now.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.079 position:50% align:center
Miyamura. You're all alone?

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:34.959 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Yoshikawa! Lemme borrow a pen.

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50% align:center
You had a million
last time I counted.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:38.630 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
You can't even count that high!

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
And if you're gonna be a bully
about it, you don't get one.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.634 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Well, you suck.

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:44.427 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Anybody pick up the packet yet?

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.554 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Yeah, I have it.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.016 position:50% align:center
Nice!

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.268 position:50% align:center
Turning the outline
into a draft's all Hori!

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.895 position:50% align:center
Need more paper?

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:55.563 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Nah, we should be good.

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:57.732 position:50% align:center
Miyamura.
You've got the chart, cool?

00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:59.275 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Oh. Sure.

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA grunts]

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.993 position:50% align:center
Hori! Toru took my pen,
and he won't give it back!

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:10.745 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm still using it, okay?

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.205 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Knock it off, you two!

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:28.263 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Friends.
Can I really call them that?

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.682 position:50% align:center
Are we friends?

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.475 position:50% align:center
Hard to wrap my head around.

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:34.936 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
HuH?

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.022 position:50% align:center
I've been looking for you.

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
Everything cool?

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:40.984 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no big deal.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:43.653 position:50% align:center
Our next class was just
switched from Math to Econ.

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:47.240 position:50% align:center
Uh... I don't think
I brought the textbook for that.

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:50.535 position:50% align:center
When they pull crap like this,
it's so unfair.

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:53.580 position:50% align:center
Listen, man,
I gotta ask you something.

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:04.257 position:50% align:center
So, yeah.

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:05.884 position:50% align:center
You got any helpful advice?

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.763 position:50% align:center
What?

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:12.932 position:50% align:center
Wait! Were you zoning out
this whole time?

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:15.727 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] It's just...
I have a question, too.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.062 position:50% align:center
Ishikawa.

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:21.524 position:50% align:center
What, um,
what do you think of me?

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:25.487 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Asking people
that with a straight face

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
is creepy as hell.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:30.825 position:50% align:center
As if you getting close with
Hori isn't annoying enough.

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:34.079 position:50% align:center
It's also frustrating how you
never say what you mean.

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:36.081 position:50% align:center
And you're just plain weird.

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:40.168 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] You're also way
too nice to people.

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
But the real kicker is
when you lose the glasses

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:43.171 position:50% align:center
and put your hair up,

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:45.507 position:50% align:center
you're prettier
than most girls I know.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50% align:center
It ticks me off.

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:51.638 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA groans]
So I'm a pretty-boy?

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.640 position:50% align:center
Ah! That's another thing!

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:55.892 position:50% align:center
You make me say the dumbest
shit without even realizing it,

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.644 position:50% align:center
and it drives me frickin' crazy!

00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.270 position:50% align:center
That's my fault?

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:01.815 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
If I'm being honest,

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:04.943 position:50% align:center
I guess I kinda wonder what you
think of me, too, sometimes.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:05.944 position:50% align:center
You're one of the few people

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:08.238 position:50% align:center
who still calls me
by my last name.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:12.867 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
T-Toru.

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.369 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Hmm?

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:20.792 position:50% align:center
The heck?

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.961 position:50% align:center
Don't say it if you're gonna be
all bashful afterward, dude!

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:24.421 position:50% align:center
Ah! I'm so sorry!

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:25.463 position:50% align:center
It just slipped out!

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:31.761 position:50% align:center
But... Um...
Truthfully... Well...

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:34.055 position:50% align:center
The reason I acted so funny was

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
because that was
first time in high school

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50% align:center
I called a classmate
by their first name.

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:40.228 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
I swear.

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:45.608 position:50% align:center
You're so weird.

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:49.946 position:50% align:center
[BOY C]
Miyamura's so weird!

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:57.162 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.330 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Don't apologize.

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:02.334 position:50% align:center
I didn't say it was bad.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:06.171 position:50% align:center
Nothing wrong with
being a little awkward.

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:09.007 position:50% align:center
Ain't that right, Izumi?

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.142 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
I'm okay.

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:27.817 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] I wish I could go
back in time ten years

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center
and tell myself that.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:33.615 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna
do a forehead flick,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.535 position:50% align:center
hold back a little so you
don't hit our skulls so hard.

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:40.663 position:50% align:center
I said we'd finished the report
over lunch, and you both bail?

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.499 position:50% align:center
You better have a good reason!

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
Is affirming our friendship
on the roof a good reason?

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.295 position:50% align:center
[HORI] You're both as creepy
as you are stupid

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:48.463 position:50% align:center
if you're being serious.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.506 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Hey, if we're stupid,

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.174 position:50% align:center
then what does that
make Yoshikawa?

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] And what
is that supposed to mean?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.637 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:05.313 position:50% align:center
Hey. 'Sup, Ishikawa?

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:06.981 position:50% align:center
Sleep well?

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:10.777 position:50% align:center
So... I watched that show
you were raving about.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.320 position:50% align:center
Izum...

00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's still too soon, but
do you have a favorite part?

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:17.200 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Let's see.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
And here I thinking

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.912 position:50% align:center
we were on a
first-name basis now.

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.747 position:50% align:center
This guy's a total mystery.

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:25.583 position:50% align:center
Did you hear me? Hey. Ishikawa?

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50% align:center
You done yet, Sissy? Time to go!

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:35.468 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
What? This early?

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:38.555 position:50% align:center
[SOTA] Yeah! Yuna's
waiting on me, so hurry up!

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:48.481 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Sota's been
getting up way earlier

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.025 position:50% align:center
now that he's in grade school.

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
Nobody's even here yet.

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
This seat taken?

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:59.075 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hey, Ayasaki.

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.119 position:50% align:center
Remi thought we had
a morning assembly today,

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:03.163 position:50% align:center
so she got here early.

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:05.373 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Same here.

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:07.625 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:14.215 position:50% align:center
So... that Miyamura guy
is pretty hot, huh?

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:16.217 position:50% align:center
Uh... Is he?

00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:19.012 position:50% align:center
Are you his girlfriend 'cause
you sure act like you are?

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.680 position:50% align:center
Wha...? Nuh-uh!

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:22.057 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
Hm.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.392 position:50% align:center
You don't say.

00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:27.437 position:50% align:center
Well great, I guess that means
Remi can have him, then.

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:32.525 position:50% align:center
Huh? Sorry. Have?

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:34.819 position:50% align:center
Yeah he's fair game so why not?

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:38.031 position:50% align:center
I mean I can get as close as I
want to Miyamura if he's single.

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't make any
difference to you, right?

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, yeah.

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
Cool! Then Remi calls dibs!

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.461 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
No.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
Hmm?

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.798 position:50% align:center
There's no "dibs." He's mine.

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:57.133 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
What? Hold on.

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:59.302 position:50% align:center
How can you claim someone
when 30 seconds before

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
you weren't even dating him?

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
I'm not giving him to you.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:02.889 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:04.265 position:50% align:center
Because I don't want to!

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:05.809 position:50% align:center
That's why!

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:07.435 position:50% align:center
Remi asked if you were
Miyamura's girlfriend,

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:08.812 position:50% align:center
and you said no!

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:11.106 position:50% align:center
So he doesn't belong to you!

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
I know what I said.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:15.068 position:50% align:center
And now I'm saying
you can't have him!

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.444 position:50% align:center
Not ever!

00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
Do you hear me?

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:19.864 position:50% align:center
I'll never let you have him!

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:23.118 position:50% align:center
I hope the cafeteria's open.

00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:28.665 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:30.083 position:50% align:center
Well, see ya!

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:41.678 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
I'm so stupid.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50% align:center
Miyamura doesn't
belong to anyone.

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:06.369 position:50% align:center
I should be used to these
messes by now, but no.

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.371 position:50% align:center
I don't care if
Sota's in a rush to play,

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.832 position:50% align:center
the living room
is not his closet!

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:13.084 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:15.754 position:50% align:center
Aw. Sota's MIA?

00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:18.381 position:50% align:center
These days he only comes
home to change for soccer.

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:19.758 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:22.969 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA chuckles]
That's a kid's stamina for ya.

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
You can't do blueberries,
right, Hori?

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:26.723 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Mmm.

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:30.185 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Sota's been busier
since he started grade school.

00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
So Miyamura and I spend
a lot more time alone.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:37.192 position:50% align:center
That fruit tart you brought over
the other day was really good.

00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:38.610 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Oh, yeah?

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:41.154 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not, that one
was made by yours truly.

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:43.823 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Look at you, Mister Talented.

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:52.874 position:50% align:center
Sometimes.
We just sort of stop talking.

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:58.838 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
That looked way too real!

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:01.549 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Come on,
it was totally special effects.

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:02.425 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
I bet you're saying that

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:03.718 position:50% align:center
because you're actually scared

00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:05.637 position:50% align:center
and you just don't
wanna admit it, right?

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.805 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
I know it's fake

00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:09.724 position:50% align:center
'cause that stuff only
happens in movies.

00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:11.559 position:50% align:center
Relax, Miyamura.

00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:14.145 position:50% align:center
That's the sound
of a text, not a demon.

00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:18.650 position:50% align:center
Oh. Mom's gonna
be late again. Shocker.

00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
I'm so embarrassed.

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
Blackout?

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:27.617 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] H-Hey, Hori.
Where's your breaker box?

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
[HORI] The lights'll
come back in a second.

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
We're fine.

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:32.330 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
You call this fine?

00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:35.000 position:50% align:center
Wow. That was fast.

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:38.086 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
This house is definitely cursed!

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:40.922 position:50% align:center
The lights came back on,
so what's with that face?

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:43.675 position:50% align:center
Better suck it up,
'cause it's time for disc two.

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:44.926 position:50% align:center
Disc two?

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.470 position:50% align:center
They made more
of this awful franchise?

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:48.888 position:50% align:center
How many are there?

00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:50.598 position:50% align:center
We're gonna watch
the first three now,

00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:53.268 position:50% align:center
then we'll do the last two
when Sota gets home.

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:55.770 position:50% align:center
What kinda torture is this?

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:03.361 position:50% align:center
She was right,
you are double-jointed, huh?

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:04.195 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
Your finger.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.700 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.702 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Your hands are tiny, Yuki!

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:12.454 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Ooo.

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:14.039 position:50% align:center
Hey, grabby!

00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center
Doesn't your heart skip a beat
when someone takes your hand?

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:17.500 position:50% align:center
I dunno.

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:20.295 position:50% align:center
What I do know is you
have the cutest little fingers!

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:21.880 position:50% align:center
I bet your hands
look little, too,

00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:23.882 position:50% align:center
when you compare
them to a guy's.

00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:27.302 position:50% align:center
Guys' hands aren't near
as fun to compare, though.

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Latch on and you're dead.

00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:34.225 position:50% align:center
You hear what
she said, Miyamura?

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:35.727 position:50% align:center
I'm literally risking my life

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.229 position:50% align:center
just for the chance
to touch Hori's hand.

00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:39.939 position:50% align:center
Mine are open and waiting!

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:41.316 position:50% align:center
You can touch away!

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.359 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
No thanks!

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.319 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Your finger's
double-jointed!

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:45.403 position:50% align:center
That's so neat, Hori!

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:47.906 position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm. Makes me unique.

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:48.907 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Did you break it

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.741 position:50% align:center
when you were a
kid or something?

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:51.242 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Nope.

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:53.453 position:50% align:center
I was born with it.

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:56.831 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] How does that
joint even work, though?

00:15:56.915 --> 00:16:01.503 position:50% align:center
Huh. I'd probably need an
x-ray to find out for sure.

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:03.797 position:50% align:center
Wow, you are super pale!

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.632 position:50% align:center
Is that callus from
writing too much?

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:07.092 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Yeah.

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:10.011 position:50% align:center
It's crazy that your hands
are bigger than mine.

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:12.514 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
What? Why is that crazy?

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:15.600 position:50% align:center
I thought they were
smaller for some reason.

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:26.152 position:50% align:center
I like...

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
...your hands!

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:30.281 position:50% align:center
I... I really like your hands.

00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:31.449 position:50% align:center
They're nice and soft!

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:32.909 position:50% align:center
They are?

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:35.328 position:50% align:center
Yeah, 'n' my thoughts were
so loud, they just came out!

00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:38.248 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Maybe it's because
I hold my pencil the right way.

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:39.958 position:50% align:center
I don't have
calluses like you do.

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:42.252 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Hey! That was uncalled for!

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:47.424 position:50% align:center
Well, cool. And same.

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:49.801 position:50% align:center
I like... yours, too.

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:51.386 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Yeah?

00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:55.849 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
I like your hands

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:58.393 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
You said that already.

00:16:58.476 --> 00:16:59.811 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Yeah.

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:02.397 position:50% align:center
I'm back!

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.690 position:50% align:center
Hey, welcome home!

00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:05.692 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Have you
washed your hands, Sota?

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center
Not yet!
What's with the DVD, Bro?

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:10.905 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Hori was being
a bit of a scatterbrain

00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:15.160 position:50% align:center
and put them in the wrong cases,
so I'm swapping them out.

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:18.621 position:50% align:center
Hey, hurry and wash up!

00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:19.998 position:50% align:center
It's nearly dinnertime!

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.332 position:50% align:center
[SOTA]
Okay.

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:22.542 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Oh, Miyamura.

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:24.419 position:50% align:center
Were you planning on
eating with us tonight?

00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:27.005 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah. I was.

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.424 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Then go show Sota
the meaning of the word clean!

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:32.218 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
You got it. Come on. Let's go.

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
[SOTA]
Mm-hm.

00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:47.817 position:50% align:center
Then she suddenly
got all defensive.

00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:50.362 position:50% align:center
She said Miyamura is hers,
and Remi can't have him.

00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:51.571 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
What?

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center
I was just joking around
with her, of course.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.450 position:50% align:center
But Hori got super mad.

00:17:55.533 --> 00:17:58.328 position:50% align:center
Well, not the first time
you took a joke too far.

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:01.456 position:50% align:center
But, still! Hori's scary!

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:04.584 position:50% align:center
She is one girl
you don't wanna cross.

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:14.511 position:50% align:center
Hi, Miyamura! What's up?

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:16.971 position:50% align:center
Nothing much.

00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:20.183 position:50% align:center
[HORI] What the heck
happened to your face?

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:23.144 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] I got punched and
wound up fighting with someone.

00:18:23.228 --> 00:18:25.063 position:50% align:center
What? You got in a fight?

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:26.940 position:50% align:center
But with who?

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:28.108 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Ishikawa.

00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:29.234 position:50% align:center
You're kidding me!

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:30.985 position:50% align:center
I mean, sure, he's a
big dummy dum-dum,

00:18:31.069 --> 00:18:33.238 position:50% align:center
but I never thought he'd
throw down with a friend.

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:36.241 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hori?
Actually, the truth is--

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:37.575 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
I don't wanna hear it.

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:39.786 position:50% align:center
Actions speak louder,
and this action says

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:42.288 position:50% align:center
all I need to know about
what kind of guy he is!

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:45.208 position:50% align:center
Morning, Ishikawa!
Bro! Holy shit!

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.876 position:50% align:center
Toru!

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.337 position:50% align:center
Huh? You called?

00:18:54.217 --> 00:18:56.302 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Was it like a fistfight?

00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:57.178 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Yeah.

00:18:57.262 --> 00:18:59.472 position:50% align:center
So you just punched each other?

00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:00.682 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Nah.

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
I dodged everything
'cept that first punch,

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:05.103 position:50% align:center
so I guess "fistfight"
might not be the right word.

00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:08.106 position:50% align:center
More like, I beat 'im
to a bloody pulp.

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:10.900 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] Remind me to
never get on your bad side.

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
Why were you fighting?

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.281 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] It's none of
your business, Hori.

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:18.867 position:50% align:center
Okay. I guess I'm
just having a hard time

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:23.246 position:50% align:center
picturing this
whole thing play out.

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:28.001 position:50% align:center
Will you at least tell me who
won, or is that top secret, too?

00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:30.420 position:50% align:center
That's quite a look.

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:34.466 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
'Scuse me. Pretty sure I lost.

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:35.967 position:50% align:center
Big time.

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:41.598 position:50% align:center
All I'm saying is I don't
see it happening, dude.

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:42.891 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Hmm.

00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:45.101 position:50% align:center
Will you please take
this seriously and listen?

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:47.479 position:50% align:center
You said something's
not happening, right?

00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:50.231 position:50% align:center
Hori obviously fell for you.

00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:51.483 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
You're as wrong now

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:53.318 position:50% align:center
as you were the
first time you said that.

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:54.319 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:55.653 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
It's your imagination.

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:58.365 position:50% align:center
It's not!

00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center
What if I knew
that it was the truth?

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:03.119 position:50% align:center
This some kinda test?

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:04.704 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] If Hori walked
in here at this very moment

00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:08.124 position:50% align:center
and totally confessed to you,
what would your response be?

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:10.126 position:50% align:center
Would you still brush it off?

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:13.171 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
It doesn't matter

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:15.131 position:50% align:center
because she just
sees me as a friend.

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
Why keep falling back
on that lame-ass answer?

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Because you keep asking me

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:21.304 position:50% align:center
the same lame-ass question.

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:22.389 position:50% align:center
True.

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:24.349 position:50% align:center
You said it's
obvious she likes me.

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:26.601 position:50% align:center
But I'd argue it's more
obvious she doesn't.

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:27.894 position:50% align:center
So what are you seeing?

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:29.771 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Well--!

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50% align:center
Your feelings are involved,

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center
and they're having a huge impact
on the truth you accept.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
But you can't assume how
Hori feels without asking her.

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:38.947 position:50% align:center
Look here!

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.159 position:50% align:center
You startled me,
so my reflexes took over!

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:45.537 position:50% align:center
Let's see your
reflexes handle this!

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.871 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
What?

00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:48.039 position:50% align:center
How the hell did we go
from talking about feelings

00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
to you threatening me?

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:50.834 position:50% align:center
I guess push came to shove!

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:51.626 position:50% align:center
What's that mean?

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
It means--

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:54.504 position:50% align:center
Oh shit! Sorry.

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:56.798 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
That hurt.

00:20:58.466 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Mercy! Mercy!

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
Stop, Miyamura! Please!

00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:10.061 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
It-it was self-defense!

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:12.439 position:50% align:center
Self-defense, my ass!
Completely uncalled for

00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:15.316 position:50% align:center
and irrelevant to Hori
is what it was!

00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:18.445 position:50% align:center
All this because I startled you?

00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:21.614 position:50% align:center
Not quite. I was
also really pissed off.

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:23.491 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Okay, man, if you
were trying to intimidate me,

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:25.368 position:50% align:center
mission accomplished!

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:27.746 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
It's my fault.

00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:30.498 position:50% align:center
I pushed Miyamura
past his breaking point.

00:21:30.582 --> 00:21:32.917 position:50% align:center
I feel so bad.

00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
Then it's settled.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.046 position:50% align:center
So go apologize already.

00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
Well, Miyamura told me
he's the reason

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.179 position:50% align:center
both of them got
so banged and bruised.

00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:46.681 position:50% align:center
What? Toru says it's his fault.

00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:49.642 position:50% align:center
They fight, and then
they both want the blame.

00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:50.602 position:50% align:center
Weirdos.

00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:52.645 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:53.938 position:50% align:center
I mean, jeez.

00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:56.274 position:50% align:center
Why even fight
in the first place?

00:21:58.902 --> 00:22:02.822 position:50% align:center
Please don't tell anyone,
but we were fighting about Hori.

00:22:02.906 --> 00:22:04.866 position:50% align:center
It got intense.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.160 position:50% align:center
Ho-ho-ho!

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:10.080 position:50% align:center
Uh. What's so funny?

00:22:10.497 --> 00:22:11.664 position:50% align:center
It is kinda cool, though.

00:22:11.748 --> 00:22:13.166 position:50% align:center
How guys just duke it out.

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:15.251 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA chuckles]
It sure is.
