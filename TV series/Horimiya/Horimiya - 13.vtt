00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:17.267 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] Graduation day's
right around the corner.

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:19.602 position:50% align:center
Can you believe it?

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:22.147 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:26.693 position:50% align:center
So, um, just wondering.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.575 position:50% align:center
Why's your locker still so full?

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:35.368 position:50% align:center
Take your stuff home, girl.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.372 position:50% align:center
Come on. I'll give you a hand.

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center
Show me what you wanna keep.

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:41.374 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Okay.

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:43.043 position:50% align:center
[HORI] But you're definitely
throwing out those papers!

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:45.045 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Okay!

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:46.838 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Heh. Too funny.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.382 position:50% align:center
Is Hori her bestie
or her mother?

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:50.633 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
News flash.

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:52.469 position:50% align:center
You ain't packin'
so lightly yourself there.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.845 position:50% align:center
Look who's talking.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.680 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
You procrastinating pigs.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.640 position:50% align:center
If you'd cleaned up
a little every day,

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:58.892 position:50% align:center
you'd be leaving like this!

00:00:58.933 --> 00:00:59.809 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Oh!

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:01.644 position:50% align:center
Is that a free hand I see?

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:02.896 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Two, if I'm not mistaken!

00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:03.980 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
In that case...

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.190 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
What?

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:10.028 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
I swear, you guys.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.946 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] We're putting
your muscles to good use!

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:13.031 position:50% align:center
Holy crap, Hori!

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.200 position:50% align:center
You waited this late in
the game to pack up shop?

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.952 position:50% align:center
[HORI] No, these jerks just
dropped their junk on me.

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:20.997 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Speaking of stuff,
where are your bags?

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.415 position:50% align:center
I planned ahead!

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:23.500 position:50% align:center
Put on my good-boy pants

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:26.127 position:50% align:center
and hauled stuff back
home every day! [laughs]

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:28.755 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Please don't
look at me like that.

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:31.257 position:50% align:center
Hey. I have that same CD.
Good taste.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.510 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Actually,
I think this one is yours,

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.637 position:50% align:center
I just forgot to return it.
My bad.

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:36.471 position:50% align:center
It's all cool!

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.223 position:50% align:center
Better late than never, right?

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.474 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
If you say so.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:40.308 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Come to think of it,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.519 position:50% align:center
I have some DVDs
I borrowed off you.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.436 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
Huh?

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:44.729 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
And she's not the only one.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.147 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
Huh?

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.149 position:50% align:center
There goes my easy commute home.

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:49.025 position:50% align:center
Farewell.

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:50.485 position:50% align:center
Sorry!

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:51.986 position:50% align:center
Are you?

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:55.365 position:50% align:center
Wow. You lightened your load,
but you still have so much!

00:01:55.407 --> 00:01:56.908 position:50% align:center
[IURA] Hmm... It would
make way more sense

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.993 position:50% align:center
if a bigger, stronger dude
carried it for you.

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:01.663 position:50% align:center
Like me, or
Ishikawa or... Hmm...

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:04.165 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
Or Hori!

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:07.919 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.212 position:50% align:center
Aw. Come on, now.

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:11.172 position:50% align:center
It's not like he thinks
of you as a "dude."

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:12.882 position:50% align:center
He meant that people
can rely on you,

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:14.968 position:50% align:center
which is a compliment! Eh-heh.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:51.856 position:50% align:center
[KONO] Remi, would you
mind taking care of the tra--?

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Yet another distraction.

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Is that a travel magazine?

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
Mm-hmm.

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.491 position:50% align:center
Oh. A zoo feature.

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
What do you think?

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.994 position:50% align:center
Wanna visit a
big herd of giraffes?

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.746 position:50% align:center
I mean, who wouldn't, but...

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.748 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI] Doesn't a daytrip
to the zoo sound fun?

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.250 position:50% align:center
We should all go!

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:12.419 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU] Is it the same
one we went to before?

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.005 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Not quite. Here. Look.

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
Hmm...

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
That's a little more
than a "daytrip."

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.759 position:50% align:center
I think it'd take us
at least two.

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:21.219 position:50% align:center
We'd also need a car.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.929 position:50% align:center
And money for a hotel.

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.682 position:50% align:center
If we get a car and
hotel room, you guys will go?

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:27.642 position:50% align:center
You're making her
think this might happen.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
Do not get Remi's hopes up
higher than they already are.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
--[YANAGI] Right.
--[SENGOKU] Okay, Mom.

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:32.981 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
In all honesty, though.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:34.607 position:50% align:center
I really would like a car.

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:36.276 position:50% align:center
It would literally
open up avenues.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:38.820 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI] Ah. I can't
wait to get my license.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.114 position:50% align:center
If I had my own car,

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.282 position:50% align:center
I could take you
to way more places

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:43.950 position:50% align:center
than just the zoo, y'know.

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:44.784 position:50% align:center
We could go anywhere.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:48.204 position:50% align:center
Oh. Mm-hmm. You sure could.

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
I, um, I can't help but wonder

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:53.335 position:50% align:center
if this actually goes
beyond visiting a zoo.

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:54.252 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure I follow.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
'Kay. So Remi's kinda thirsty.

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:58.965 position:50% align:center
Hold your horses there.

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.175 position:50% align:center
You can leave as
soon as you tell us

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.968 position:50% align:center
what's bothering you.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
I'm fine!

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
[KONO] So we're gonna do
this the hard way, then?

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:06.973 position:50% align:center
Sengoku, if you
would be so kind.

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:07.807 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
On it.

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI] I promise
you there's nothing wrong!

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.436 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
I know you better than that.

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
Uh, Kono?

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:14.522 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
You have two choices.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
Let us help you, or show Yanagi
something I doubt he's seen,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
but won't soon forget.

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:20.987 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
Are you threatening her?

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
Remi's tough! Do your worst!

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
Wait just a minute!

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
She's allowed to keep
her thoughts to herself!

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:27.994 position:50% align:center
You don't need
to resort to violence!

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:29.496 position:50% align:center
Or whatever it is you're...

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:32.540 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. Her cheeks.

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:34.751 position:50% align:center
There's no point to this
since we can't understand her

00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
and you want her to talk!

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
Sengoku, Tell her!

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
It's a fairly rare face to see.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
Take it all in while you can.

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:42.467 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
What?

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:45.261 position:50% align:center
Are you in any pain?

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:48.264 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
Nah. It was like a massage.

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:50.100 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
It was?

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:51.851 position:50% align:center
So here's the thing.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:54.187 position:50% align:center
It's really not
that big of a deal.

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
Remi just thought it might be
nice to go someplace fun

00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:58.983 position:50% align:center
with everybody while
we're still in high school,

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:01.027 position:50% align:center
since we're nearly done.

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.948 position:50% align:center
But then you guys started
talking about cars and licenses.

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:06.741 position:50% align:center
And I realized those
things have the potential

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:10.203 position:50% align:center
to take you far away from me,
and I don't want that.

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:11.871 position:50% align:center
They also have
the potential to help

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:13.456 position:50% align:center
with running everyday errands.

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.750 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
That's true.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
Anyway, we can nix the zoo idea.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.629 position:50% align:center
Remi was just
tossing it out there.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:22.674 position:50% align:center
We don't need sporadic daytrips
to keep our friendship going.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
Really?

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:24.718 position:50% align:center
You won't treat me
like a stranger

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.636 position:50% align:center
the second you graduate?

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:29.931 position:50% align:center
You aren't very easy to forget.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.975 position:50% align:center
--[YANAGI] I know!
--[BOTH] Huh?

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.309 position:50% align:center
As soon as I get my license,

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.478 position:50% align:center
let's reconvene
and plan a road trip!

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.938 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
I'm game. Where to?

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.898 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Ooh! How about a beach?

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.067 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
Ah. You a fan of the sea breeze?

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.986 position:50% align:center
Remi likes the beach!

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:43.820 position:50% align:center
Let's swim!

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:45.405 position:50% align:center
I only wanna look at the water!

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.073 position:50% align:center
Not swim in it.

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:49.743 position:50% align:center
Then after graduation,
that's what we'll do.

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:55.081 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI] We could make a pit
stop at a zoo on the way there!

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:55.999 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
You could go all the time

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.625 position:50% align:center
if you get a license as well.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
But then who would ride shotgun?

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:00.712 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
Aw, I wanted shotgun.

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Maybe take turns?

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.885 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Hori?

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:09.387 position:50% align:center
Earth to Hori.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
She's down for the count.

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:15.310 position:50% align:center
Carrying everyone's stuff

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:17.729 position:50% align:center
must've really
taken its toll on her.

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:19.856 position:50% align:center

Yes, ma'am! I'm here!

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center
I guess she
just wanted a pillow.

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:37.165 position:50% align:center
[MMIYAMURA]
She's frowning in her sleep.

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:40.126 position:50% align:center
Though, that is one
of her go-to faces.

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:41.169 position:50% align:center
Don't frown.

wrinkles on your forehead.

[MIYAMURA]
You're so funny.

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:02.232 position:50% align:center
I hope days like
these never end.

If it hadn't happened...

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:25.922 position:50% align:center
Least they give us
till the last day of school

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:28.216 position:50% align:center
to turn in our
graduation essays.

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:30.176 position:50% align:center
[TAKAKO]
I forgot about that!

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.469 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Speaking of graduation,

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:32.929 position:50% align:center
I wonder what
our pics look like.

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:34.681 position:50% align:center
[TAKAKO] Your guess is
as good as mine, Hori.

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:36.224 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] All I remember
was standing next to a guy

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:37.267 position:50% align:center
I'd never even talked to.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center
[IURA]

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:40.603 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Yeah.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:43.106 position:50% align:center

But you're in the same class!

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:46.317 position:50% align:center
Oop. Sorry.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.527 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

Did your sister pass that exam?

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50% align:center

Nah. She didn't.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.410 position:50% align:center

Oof. That majorly sucks.

Oh. I'm glad I ran into you.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:58.038 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
Why's that?

00:08:58.079 --> 00:08:59.664 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Just came from the council room.

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:01.207 position:50% align:center

Ah. You finish cleaning?

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:03.335 position:50% align:center

Yes. It's spick and span.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.419 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
Thanks, Kono.

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI] Sakura!
I'm ready to go when you are!

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.465 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Hey. Perfect timing, Remi.

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:12.302 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU] She looked so much
better when she had longer hair.

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:14.971 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
He is so unfriendly.

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:15.805 position:50% align:center
Walk faster!

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:18.266 position:50% align:center
We'll get there when we get
there, so stop rushing me.

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:20.560 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
Oh. Before I forget.

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:23.063 position:50% align:center
So about that shop you
mentioned the other day.

Are you listening?

Do you know those boys?

Huh? Oh. No, I don't.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.668 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] It's such a pain
to take all my stuff home.

I should've done it ages ago.

Yep. On my way.

Just one more week.

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:09.192 position:50% align:center
And we'll be
high school graduates.

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:12.821 position:50% align:center
I'm crossing my fingers
that it gets a little warmer

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.155 position:50% align:center

Oh, wow.
Surprised somebody's still here.

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
I think I left
my phone inside my desk.

Pretty sure I saw
you drop it just now.

[MIYAMURA] I'm not entirely sure
why, but ultimately, somehow...

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:25.185 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] ...my high school
days amounted to nothing.

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
At least, that's how it feels.

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.607 position:50% align:center
People always wonder "what if."

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
But dwelling on what
could've been is pointless.

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:02.639 position:50% align:center
There are so many
different roads

00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:04.808 position:50% align:center
that led me to where I am today.

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:06.976 position:50% align:center
I could've easily
taken another route--

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:08.895 position:50% align:center
and wound up somewhere else.

[HORI]
You know what?

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.071 position:50% align:center
I think we're exactly
where we're meant to be.

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
We're together like this because
that's how fate wanted it.

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.285 position:50% align:center
Maybe you're right.

00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
There was a possibility

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center
of living in a
world without you.

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:33.169 position:50% align:center

"Fate," you said.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.304 position:50% align:center
I wonder if such a thing
actually was responsible

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.432 position:50% align:center
for bringing us together.

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:48.268 position:50% align:center
Even if this "fate"
doesn't really exist,

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:51.187 position:50% align:center
I think the universe
would've slowly but surely

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:53.815 position:50% align:center
moved me to

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:52.410 position:50% align:center
Well, fine.
Now say cheese.

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:54.245 position:50% align:center
Hey! The guys are
graduating, too!

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:55.872 position:50% align:center
Take pictures of us, huh?

00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:59.459 position:50% align:center
Why'd I devote any of
my memory card to you fools?

00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:00.877 position:50% align:center
Y'all've wasted more
than enough space

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:02.712 position:50% align:center
in my brain as it is.

00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:04.130 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT FF]
C'mon, Yasuda!

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:05.131 position:50% align:center
Some of us would
like to document

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:07.342 position:50% align:center
this pivotal moment
in our lives!

00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:09.386 position:50% align:center
[SAWADA]
Hori-<i>senpai</i>!

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:12.847 position:50% align:center
I'm so sad I won't get
to see you anymore!

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:13.890 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
What's up?

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:15.975 position:50% align:center
Well, you could always
come over to my house.

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:18.561 position:50% align:center
[SAWADA gasps]
Are you for real?

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:20.146 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Not too often, though.

00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:21.690 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
They're having one last hug.

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:24.526 position:50% align:center
Nice of you to
indulge her for today.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
It's the homestretch now.

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:37.163 position:50% align:center
Um. Have you seen
Remi around recently?

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.249 position:50% align:center
Oh! Yeah, I think she was...

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
Wait, that was someone else.

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:42.502 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:50.927 position:50% align:center
Hey, so, I, um... well... Sorry.

00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
What're words, right?

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:57.517 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Thank you.

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
It's been a blast.
I really mean it.

00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:05.108 position:50% align:center
My senior year was
the highlight of my life,

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.652 position:50% align:center
and part of that
was because of you.

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:10.071 position:50% align:center
I like both you and
Yoshikawa so much.

00:17:10.113 --> 00:17:11.781 position:50% align:center
You're my friends.

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:14.242 position:50% align:center
And I'll never forget you.

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:17.954 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Me, too. I won't forget.

00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:21.124 position:50% align:center
I see. That's good to know.

00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:22.000 position:50% align:center
Thanks again.

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:24.002 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Anytime. And thank you.

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:25.337 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Bye for now!

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:28.006 position:50% align:center
Take care. See ya 'round.

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:29.466 position:50% align:center
Sure will!

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Guess it's best to leave

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:38.391 position:50% align:center
all our high school
baggage behind.

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:40.101 position:50% align:center
Good-bye.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.440 position:50% align:center
Oh! Hi! Congrats
on a job well done!

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:48.318 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] You graduated,
too, so congrats yourself!

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.153 position:50% align:center
I suppose I did, huh?

00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:51.446 position:50% align:center
Ah, that's right!

00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
I have something extremely
important to tell you!

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:55.033 position:50% align:center
Wow, this sounds major!

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:56.368 position:50% align:center
In the near future,

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.787 position:50% align:center
I'd like to go somewhere
with everyone.

00:17:58.828 --> 00:17:59.704 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
As a group?

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:01.581 position:50% align:center
Right. The other day.

00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:03.333 position:50% align:center
I got to talking with the
student council crew,

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center
and it made me
realize something.

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:06.544 position:50% align:center
Once I can legally drive,

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:09.214 position:50% align:center
I'd like to take a
trip with my friends.

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Friends. The same as always.

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:12.592 position:50% align:center
Then there's Hori.

00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:13.968 position:50% align:center
Kono sounded intrigued.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.679 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Sure. Sounds great!

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.222 position:50% align:center
So count me in!

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:18.264 position:50% align:center
I certainly will!

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center
Just wear your glasses!

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:20.809 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.310 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] It's unavoidable
for some things to change

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:23.978 position:50% align:center
once we graduate.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.147 position:50% align:center
But I know without a doubt
the friends I have today

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:28.066 position:50% align:center
will be the friends
I have tomorrow.

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:30.819 position:50% align:center
Ay! There's
my special little boy!

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.278 position:50% align:center
Hello, Kyosuke.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.072 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Is that Miyamura's dad?

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:34.906 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT E]
He's so young!

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:36.449 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT F]
I do see the resemblance!

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:38.326 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
What resemblance is that?

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:39.577 position:50% align:center
Come take a picture to preserve

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:41.454 position:50% align:center
this lovely moment
we're having. Yeah?

00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:43.707 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Okay. Let me
go find Hori real qu--

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:45.333 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:46.710 position:50% align:center
Why in the hell
would you go someplace

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:49.170 position:50% align:center
you're not even welcome,
you poor excuse for a father?

00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:51.715 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why?
Tell me dammit!

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:54.467 position:50% align:center
What kind of grown-ass man
can't pull off a suit and tie?

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.594 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Surely you'd like to meet up

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:58.722 position:50% align:center
with your own parents,
right, Miyamura?

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:00.098 position:50% align:center
My folks stopped by for a bit,

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.725 position:50% align:center
they had to hurry
and get back to work.

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:04.310 position:50% align:center
Ahh. Don't get mad, honey bun.

00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:05.353 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
You want me to be happy?

00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
Then shut up and get lost!

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:11.401 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Okay, I'm calling for a truce!

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:12.861 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN]
There! Got it!

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:14.487 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT GG]
Iura, you're too much!

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:15.864 position:50% align:center
I think that I'm just enough!

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:17.115 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Shu!

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:18.908 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
Moto? What a surprise.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center
Hi.

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
I take it this this is
your little sister?

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:22.912 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:24.914 position:50% align:center
You come all this way
to pick up your brother?

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:26.541 position:50% align:center
I'm here 'cause Mom
wanted me to let you know

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:28.668 position:50% align:center
you have to come
home early today.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
Plus I figured I could see what
my new school would be like.

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:33.506 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! You don't say!

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:36.259 position:50% align:center
If that ceremony wasn't
so darn long, I'd be home now!

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:37.385 position:50% align:center
But no time like the present,

00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:40.180 position:50% align:center
so let's get our butts
in gear and book it, sis!

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.015 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll see you
when I see you, 'kay bye!

00:19:42.057 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT GG]
Bye!

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:45.894 position:50% align:center
He didn't lose any pep
through all three years.

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:47.687 position:50% align:center
Thus all is right
with the world.

00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:52.859 position:50% align:center
Question for you.

00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:55.195 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and ask me.

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
You're really my brother, right?

00:19:57.113 --> 00:19:58.448 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
Better believe it.

00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:05.455 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Miyamura!

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:08.083 position:50% align:center
We're getting sushi to
celebrate, you wanna come?

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:10.168 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.878 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Sweet! Let's get going then!

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
Kyosuke's gonna be
so excited to see you there,

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.298 position:50% align:center
maybe too excited.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.883 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
To the sushi!

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:19.928 position:50% align:center
There's no distance.

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:22.931 position:50% align:center
I've never been this
close to someone before.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:25.642 position:50% align:center
In my life.

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:27.936 position:50% align:center
Boundaries don't apply to us,

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:30.855 position:50% align:center
and I used to be
terrified of that.

00:20:30.897 --> 00:20:32.565 position:50% align:center
It shook me to my core.

00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
Hori.

00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:37.070 position:50% align:center
But you know... Because of you,

00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:41.741 position:50% align:center
I felt a whirlwind of emotions I
wasn't even aware I could feel.

00:20:44.327 --> 00:20:45.912 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] I don't think
either of us realized

00:20:45.954 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
how nerve-wracking
simply being yourself

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:50.291 position:50% align:center
around other people could be.

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
No fronts. Just us.

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
Gradually breaking
down our walls.

00:20:56.339 --> 00:21:00.301 position:50% align:center
But you made me realize
that and then some.

00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:04.681 position:50% align:center
And I find myself asking,
"What can I do for you?"

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
How many ways can
I make you smile?

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:10.562 position:50% align:center
You're one of the
strongest people I know.

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:13.231 position:50% align:center
Yet still so fragile.

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:15.400 position:50% align:center
So delicate.

00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:18.069 position:50% align:center
So precious.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.074 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Instead of a shadow,
bright, sunny days

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:26.119 position:50% align:center
are what follow behind you.

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:30.457 position:50% align:center
My whole life, the only person
I knew this well, was myself.

00:21:32.709 --> 00:21:33.668 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
I was oblivious

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.421 position:50% align:center
to how breathtaking
the world could truly be.

00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:41.092 position:50% align:center
Then you came in
and shattered my reality.

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:43.136 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:46.431 position:50% align:center
You told me you wanted
a future with me.

00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:47.682 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:53.730 position:50% align:center
But what can I do for you?

00:21:53.772 --> 00:21:56.441 position:50% align:center
How can I repay you
for what you've done?

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.404 position:50% align:center
Hurry up! Miyamura!

00:22:07.786 --> 00:22:09.204 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Wow.

00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:12.999 position:50% align:center
The spring sky is bluer
than I've ever seen.

00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:15.835 position:50% align:center
If I could give you
this very sky as a gift,

00:22:15.877 --> 00:22:17.796 position:50% align:center
I would in heartbeat.

00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:20.006 position:50% align:center
Then again...

00:22:20.048 --> 00:22:23.510 position:50% align:center
Nah. I know what you'd like.

00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:26.680 position:50% align:center
A cake with tons of
whipped cream on top.

00:22:26.721 --> 00:22:28.390 position:50% align:center
That's more your style.
