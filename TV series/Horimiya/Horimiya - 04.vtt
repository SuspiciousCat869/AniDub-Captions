00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:21.855 position:50% align:center
Wha...? Uh, o... kay...

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:25.275 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Sorry! That was an accident!

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:04.332 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Two. Four. Six. Eight.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:08.712 position:50% align:center
By the way,
thanks for your help.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.714 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Must be tough to do this solo.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.590 position:50% align:center
[KONO sighs]
I'm not alone.

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.175 position:50% align:center
I have Remi and Sengoku,

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.595 position:50% align:center
and they do their best to try
to handle as much as they can.

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:21.516 position:50% align:center
It's nice.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.935 position:50% align:center
Remi always opens
up this window for us.

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.229 position:50% align:center
So we get to enjoy the breeze.

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:30.859 position:50% align:center
You know, you're pretty cool.

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:32.318 position:50% align:center
Don't see many people
working their butts off

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.320 position:50% align:center
when no one's around to watch.

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:37.115 position:50% align:center
What? That's cool? Since when?

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.076 position:50% align:center
So you, uh, good to go?

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.747 position:50% align:center
Uh... Mm-hmm. I'll be fine.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.874 position:50% align:center
Thanks again, Ishikawa.

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.543 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:49.919 position:50% align:center
This for me?

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.629 position:50% align:center
You were taking your sweet time,

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:54.507 position:50% align:center
and Hori felt bad
because it was so hot.

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:56.593 position:50% align:center
So--she made a pit stop.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.928 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Ugh!
You must be dying in that!

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:02.015 position:50% align:center
Promise me you'll take your
jacket off when you leave!

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:03.767 position:50% align:center
These should help
in the meantime.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.311 position:50% align:center
Share 'em with Toru
when he gets here.

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:08.271 position:50% align:center
So, yeah. Enjoy.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.273 position:50% align:center
She said they were half price.

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:12.650 position:50% align:center
I see. Hori thinks
of everything.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:13.943 position:50% align:center
She's so nice.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.237 position:50% align:center
But she got me the
one flavor I can't eat!

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:20.909 position:50% align:center
Stop right there!

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.581 position:50% align:center
This is what you
guys stopped me for?

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:29.584 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't have
the stomach for two.

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.086 position:50% align:center
I'm your garbage disposal?

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.921 position:50% align:center
Yeah, kinda.

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.340 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. Your tongue's white.

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:37.467 position:50% align:center
Might wanna get that looked at.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.178 position:50% align:center
Oh! I bet it's the popsicle.

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:41.680 position:50% align:center
Yours, too?

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:44.265 position:50% align:center
Dude! It's, like,
greener than the grass!

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
And here I am still
sweating my ass off

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:49.688 position:50% align:center
while you two go
'n' have all the fun.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:52.691 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Your tongue...
is super long!

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:53.566 position:50% align:center
It is?

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.152 position:50% align:center
Are you part snake? Fascinating.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50% align:center
I'll have to inform
Remi and Sakura of this.

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50% align:center
Could you not?

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:02.659 position:50% align:center
Who's Sakura again?

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.577 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU] She's another
member of the student council.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
Full name's Sakura Kono.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:09.207 position:50% align:center
Huh... Oh! Nerdy Girl!

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.001 position:50% align:center
Please don't call her that.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50% align:center
You know,
I never realized it before,

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.131 position:50% align:center
but the council
has got a lot of girls.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:18.341 position:50% align:center
A special harem just for you.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.260 position:50% align:center
Hey! It's strictly business!

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:21.803 position:50% align:center
You really are a spoiled king

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:24.556 position:50% align:center
'cause you get the ladies and
the AC in the council room.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.640 position:50% align:center
It's not fair!

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:27.142 position:50% align:center
No man should have such power!

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.227 position:50% align:center
You make me
sound like a villain.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.563 position:50% align:center
But the AC is nice.

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:35.108 position:50% align:center
So anytime you guys get
beat by the heat, swing by.

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:37.569 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:42.032 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Rock paper scissors!

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.159 position:50% align:center
No! Why me?

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
 Hori and Miyamura have to go!

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:49.748 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU] I said, "swing by,"
not "bring all your friends."

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.624 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Oolong tea. Orange juice.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.669 position:50% align:center
A cola. What was the other one?

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:56.421 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Strawberry milk.

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:58.340 position:50% align:center
Hey. So gimme the scoop:

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:01.551 position:50% align:center
Are those two dating, or is
Remi missing something here?

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
It's weird.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:07.349 position:50% align:center
The two of them don't make
any sense as a couple to me.

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:09.601 position:50% align:center
I could see Hori
with Ishikawa, though.

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:11.144 position:50% align:center
Wha...? Wait! Really?!

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:13.355 position:50% align:center
Now would be a good time
to drop that topic.

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
He just gave up on
her, like, days ago.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.782 position:50% align:center
[KONO] She said he gave up,
but I think he still likes her.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sounds like it.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU] A bit of advice
if you wanna date Kyo-chan.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.749 position:50% align:center
You'd better be
one hell of a masochist.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.543 position:50% align:center
Hang on. What kind
of advice is that, man?

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.047 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
So Ishikawa has a crush on Hori.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.550 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Ah, crap! Not that one!

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.636 position:50% align:center
Who was that for?

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA sighs]

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.599 position:50% align:center
They are taking forever.

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
Must've stopped
for something else.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:55.355 position:50% align:center
Oh, I wasn't implying they
were doing anything suspect!

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:56.690 position:50% align:center
C'mon, though.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.650 position:50% align:center
What could two high school
kids possibly get up to

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
while they're off on their own?

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:03.154 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah. I don't have a clue.

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Sheesh, get it together!

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.284 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Sorry.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
It's your fault
he's like this, Sakura!

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.248 position:50% align:center
I should've phrased it better.

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
My guess is Miyamura
slowed them down

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.420 position:50% align:center
by dropping the change.

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:20.505 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Thank you, you kind soul.

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
Since I'm the
class leader today,

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:24.092 position:50% align:center
I'll log this act for posterity.

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.886 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI] Don't fill class logs
with useless garbage, please.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.431 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] Stop messing
around with my hair!

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Messing around...

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:34.436 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
We finally made it back!

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:36.438 position:50% align:center
I know that was
a really long wait.

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
Better late than never.
Got my soda, man?

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:40.442 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.360 position:50% align:center
Huh? Um. What for?

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:43.945 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Hori screwed me.

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:48.033 position:50% align:center
I did my best, but I failed,
and you're the one to suffer.

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:49.951 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Stop!
You've said enough already!

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:51.077 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:52.203 position:50% align:center
Beats me.

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:54.789 position:50% align:center
It's nothing much.
He dropped his soda.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:57.625 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
Damn. Sucks to be him right now.

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.294 position:50% align:center
I can't say I blame him
for getting upset

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:00.795 position:50% align:center
'cause I would be, too.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.172 position:50% align:center
Might even get payback.

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.966 position:50% align:center
Look at Remi's man,
bein' all tough and macho!

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.468 position:50% align:center
Hoo, boy.

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:07.385 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Yoshikawa?

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:08.636 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Hmm?

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
You always have an extra
pen to spare, don't you?

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:12.932 position:50% align:center
Could you stab me in
the arm with one? Please?

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.225 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:15.602 position:50% align:center
Don't hurt yourself
over something like this!

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.937 position:50% align:center
Give me a second
to try and explain!

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.356 position:50% align:center
It wasn't planned.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.441 position:50% align:center
Gravity just took over, y'know?

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:22.275 position:50% align:center
Clumsy me.

00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:23.485 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Yeah, No kidding.

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:25.070 position:50% align:center
He was all over the place.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:27.739 position:50% align:center
Ultimately, though I'm
the one who gave it to 'im,

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:29.741 position:50% align:center
so... what's done is done.

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center
That's exactly right!
So get over it!

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.245 position:50% align:center
Oh, like hell
I'm getting over it!

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:35.330 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.248 position:50% align:center
Give it a rest, Toru.
It's just soda.

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:39.250 position:50% align:center
Wait, huh?

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:41.503 position:50% align:center
Wh-Wh-Why-Why's it exploding?!

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:43.088 position:50% align:center
Dammit, Miyamura!

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:45.006 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.800 position:50% align:center
I'm all sticky now.

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:50.053 position:50% align:center
Miyamura accidentally dropped
your drink on the way back.

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:52.597 position:50% align:center
Ah. So that's what he meant.

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:53.765 position:50% align:center
I get it now 

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:55.100 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Here.

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:58.269 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Thanks, Kono.

00:07:58.353 --> 00:07:59.854 position:50% align:center
'Preciate it!

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:04.818 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
You're very welcome.

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:16.538 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Sorry the AC's broken.

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:19.082 position:50% align:center
Daytime heat doesn't
bother me so much.

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:21.209 position:50% align:center
But if it's hot at night,
I sleep naked.

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:22.711 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:25.130 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow I should use the
student council room to study.

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:26.548 position:50% align:center
Wait! You sleep nude?

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:30.051 position:50% align:center
I... Well...
I keep underwear on!

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:31.553 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Is that not normal?

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:32.846 position:50% align:center
Aw, man.

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:38.059 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Come to think of it,
he isn't shy about undressing.

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:39.436 position:50% align:center
Wait, am I supposed
to get embarrassed

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:42.856 position:50% align:center
when he strips in front of me?

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.525 position:50% align:center
Well, now just thinking about it
makes me feel embarrassed.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:46.985 position:50% align:center
Hey. Random.

00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:48.820 position:50% align:center
But can I see
your tattoos, please?

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:50.572 position:50% align:center
Hm? Of course.

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Seriously?

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
All a girl has to do is ask
and you'll start stripping?

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:58.038 position:50% align:center
You didn't even
question my motives!

00:08:58.121 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
Why question it when
you said, "please," though?

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:05.170 position:50% align:center
Are you like an
exhibitionist or what?

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:06.629 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Hey!

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:09.049 position:50% align:center
I only felt comfortable because
you've seen them before.

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:10.759 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
What if Toru asked?

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:13.678 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Well, sure,
I'd be fine with that, too.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:16.097 position:50% align:center
I showed him my tats one
of the first days we talked.

00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:17.307 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
What if the tables were turned,

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
and he bared it
all in front of you?

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.519 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] That really
depends on the situation.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:22.354 position:50% align:center
Which means?

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:24.272 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Stop!

00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:25.273 position:50% align:center
My turn.

00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:27.984 position:50% align:center
Where'd this come from? Explain.

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:31.613 position:50% align:center
Uh... I suddenly realized
nothing seems to fluster you

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.908 position:50% align:center
so this was just me trying
to figure out what does.

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:37.077 position:50% align:center
In a beat-around-the-bush
sort of way.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.371 position:50% align:center
'Cause like, it seems I'm
constantly acting like a spaz,

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:40.622 position:50% align:center
whereas you always play it cool.

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:41.706 position:50% align:center
And I can count
the number of times

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.000 position:50% align:center
I've seen you blush on one hand,

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:46.961 position:50% align:center
while I blush really easily.

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:49.214 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Uh-huh.

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.800 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Great! He's totally
creeped out by me!

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:56.388 position:50% align:center
Uh. So then, you were testing me
to see if I'd get embarrassed?

00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:59.516 position:50% align:center
I'd be up to do
a retest if you want!

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:00.642 position:50% align:center
What's the point?

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
It's useless
if you know about it!

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:03.812 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
I mean, it is hot.

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:05.230 position:50% align:center
Going shirtless
would feel better.

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:06.856 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
You failed the retest, too!

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.566 position:50% align:center
All right! My bad!

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.568 position:50% align:center
But be honest, do you
really believe I've developed

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:13.571 position:50% align:center
the sort of personality that
makes me feel no shame?

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.365 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.325 position:50% align:center
Lil' bit. Yes, I do.

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:18.702 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.412 position:50% align:center
So, recently,

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:22.914 position:50% align:center
I ran into a buddy of mine
from middle school.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Go on.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:27.877 position:50% align:center
[SHINDO]
Miyamura?

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:32.882 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Shindo!

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
[SHINDO]
Damn, man, I'm so jealous!

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:36.970 position:50% align:center
You're finally growin' up on me.

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:38.680 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sorry, what?

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.098 position:50% align:center
As if you didn't know.

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see. Yep,
I'm a senior now.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:47.022 position:50% align:center
You know, if you weren't
held back, you'd be one, too.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.525 position:50% align:center
No! That's not what
I meant, you moron!

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.444 position:50% align:center
I was talking about
your new girlfriend! 

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:55.113 position:50% align:center
Uh! I don't have
one of those, though.

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:57.073 position:50% align:center
Chyeah. Like I believe that.

00:10:57.157 --> 00:11:00.535 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] It's funny to me, but
Hori might not see the humor.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.746 position:50% align:center
So her name's Hori, huh?

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
You and this girlfriend of yours

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:07.042 position:50% align:center
aren't even on a
first-name basis yet?

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:11.046 position:50% align:center
We totally are.

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:13.048 position:50% align:center
I got caught up in the moment.

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:14.966 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.010 position:50% align:center
Sorry. But there it is.

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:20.055 position:50% align:center
You wanted an example of me
getting super flustered, right?

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:22.432 position:50% align:center
Doesn't get much
more flustered than that.

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:23.975 position:50% align:center
Oh! But the next time we talk,

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:26.478 position:50% align:center
I'll set him straight and tell
him we aren't really dating.

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:30.357 position:50% align:center
Huh? I don't actually mind
if he's not set straight.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.150 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Ha!

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
The friend in question
just texted me!

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.612 position:50% align:center
His ears must've been burning.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:36.363 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:38.865 position:50% align:center
He sa--

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.075 position:50% align:center
Um, you okay?

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:43.328 position:50% align:center
Oh! He sent a picture.

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
I wanna see!

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:47.290 position:50% align:center
Come on! All I want's a peek!

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:48.958 position:50% align:center
Just gimme a sec.

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.836 position:50% align:center
[HORI] One. That was
one second, now hand it over!

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.254 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
What is that idiot thinking?

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:54.673 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Miyamura!

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50% align:center
Are even you listening to me?

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:56.758 position:50% align:center
Yes! I hear you!

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.510 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Way uncalled for!

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:00.261 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
And delete.

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:02.931 position:50% align:center
[HORI] I've never
seen this side of you.

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
Is everything okay?

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:06.518 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. Everything's fine!

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
You know how guys can be.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:09.521 position:50% align:center
No worries.

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:10.897 position:50% align:center
[SHINDO]
What up, what up?

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.440 position:50% align:center
Die!

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.694 position:50% align:center
He's your middle school friend,

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:17.779 position:50% align:center
and you say hello
by saying, "Die"?

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:20.865 position:50% align:center
That how you always talk?

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
[HORI] He really does
flip his lid sometimes.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.703 position:50% align:center
Hey. If you wanna
talk like that with Toru,

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:26.371 position:50% align:center
you should try it!

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:29.499 position:50% align:center
Well, if the two of us become
better friends, then maybe.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
[HORI] And he's shy
about the weirdest stuff.

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:33.545 position:50% align:center
The two of you seem
like good friends to me.

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:34.671 position:50% align:center
You really think so?

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.339 position:50% align:center
Kinda crazy how
that happened, huh?

00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
[HORI] You've reclaimed
the creepy crown.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:42.762 position:50% align:center
[HORI] There's still so much
I don't know about Miyamura.

00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
What kind of kid was he
was like in middle school?

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.434 position:50% align:center
I'm curious.

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:52.731 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Mmkay. I think
I got everything I needed.

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:55.150 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:56.359 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap.

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:58.903 position:50% align:center
Did I get sick from
blasting the AC?

00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:00.405 position:50% align:center
No. The only people

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:02.115 position:50% align:center
who catch colds in
the summer are morons.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:04.075 position:50% align:center
--[SHINDO] Hey, hey! Hori!
--Huh?

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:07.912 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Who's he?

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:10.081 position:50% align:center
What? They have a new single?

00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:11.583 position:50% align:center
Just came out last week.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:14.669 position:50% align:center
Shu was a bro
and let me borrow it.

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.755 position:50% align:center
Nice. I might ask him for it.

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:19.049 position:50% align:center
The vocals are
totally insane, and...

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:21.343 position:50% align:center
Hold up.
The girl getting hit on.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:22.510 position:50% align:center
Is that Hori?

00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:24.804 position:50% align:center
Huh? What are yo--

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:26.264 position:50% align:center
Hey! Ho--

00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:29.017 position:50% align:center
What the hell are
you doing, Shindo?

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.435 position:50% align:center
[SHINDO]
Hey. What's up?

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.354 position:50% align:center
Were your girlfriend
senses tingling?

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:34.356 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Shut up!

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:36.274 position:50% align:center
Aw.. I've been your
friend for forever, man!

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:38.109 position:50% align:center
You can't even introduce me?

00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:39.611 position:50% align:center
Second-year Koichi Shindo,

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:41.363 position:50% align:center
we went to the same school,
that satisfactory?

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
For an online search,
it's satisfactory.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:46.201 position:50% align:center
Miyamura. Do you
actually know him?

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:47.744 position:50% align:center
Uhh... Nuh-uh.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.288 position:50% align:center
[HORI] You just admitted
he went to your school.

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:52.082 position:50% align:center
Wait. Second-year?

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:52.957 position:50% align:center
[SHINDO]
Mm-hmm.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:54.292 position:50% align:center
I was held back.

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:55.418 position:50% align:center
Which means...

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
He's as dumb as they come.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:58.338 position:50% align:center
Stupid is as Shindo does.

00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.923 position:50% align:center
Hey! I go to Yasaka, though!

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:00.674 position:50% align:center
So mean.

00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:01.758 position:50% align:center
Pachi High?

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.259 position:50% align:center
Still, given the chance,

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.053 position:50% align:center
I'd change 'n' go
to Katagiri with you.

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:07.013 position:50% align:center
Huh? But why?

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:09.474 position:50% align:center
'Cause you make it
seem like it's a good time.

00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:12.060 position:50% align:center
Or... your girl's a good time.

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:14.229 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
I told you, it isn't like that!

00:14:14.312 --> 00:14:15.897 position:50% align:center
You're so cute when you're shy!

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.065 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Shut your mouth!

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:18.483 position:50% align:center
Okay, guys. If we're gonna talk,

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:20.276 position:50% align:center
can we get outta
this heat, please?

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.362 position:50% align:center
Sure! Let's go chill out
at a restaurant.

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:24.364 position:50% align:center
Or you can just leave!

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:25.865 position:50% align:center

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:32.038 position:50% align:center
[school bell tolls]

00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:33.748 position:50% align:center
[SHINDO] That bell means
we gotta switch classrooms,

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:34.833 position:50% align:center
doesn't it?

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:36.209 position:50% align:center
Better hustle!

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.503 position:50% align:center
[TANIHARA]
Yo, Shindo! Wait up!

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
[SHINDO]
Op! Forgot my notebook.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:45.927 position:50% align:center
Go on ahead.

00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:50.974 position:50% align:center
Comin' to class?

00:14:57.272 --> 00:14:59.524 position:50% align:center
It starts in two minutes!

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:08.658 position:50% align:center
Sheesh! I mean,
at least pick up your stuff!

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:11.411 position:50% align:center
Here you go.

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.583 position:50% align:center
[SHINDO]
Uh. Yamamura?

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
That's wrong.

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:20.712 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's wrong?

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:22.380 position:50% align:center
My name isn't Yamamura.

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:23.965 position:50% align:center
Uh! I was just kidding!

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:25.633 position:50% align:center
Everyone knows you're Yamamoto!

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
You're getting even colder.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.054 position:50% align:center
[SHINDO]
Is Yamakawa warmer?

00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA
"Yama's" not part of it!

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.432 position:50% align:center
[SHINDO]
Kawada!

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:33.850 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA sighs] You seriously
should've stopped guessing,

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.226 position:50% align:center
like, two names ago.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.478 position:50% align:center
I haven't talked to a classmate

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:39.105 position:50% align:center
or raised my voice
in such a long time.

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:42.067 position:50% align:center
Feels weird to be doing it now.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.403 position:50% align:center
For real? Come on, man!
Yeah, right!

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
[SHINDO]
Miyamura!

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:48.156 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:49.366 position:50% align:center
Hey! That's mine.

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:51.409 position:50% align:center
I just want a sip is all!

00:15:53.078 --> 00:15:55.163 position:50% align:center
You catch the Osaka set on TV?

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
Talk about a concert!

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know!
It was so cool!

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.920 position:50% align:center
[SHINDO] And how awesome were
the lights and special effects?

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:04.798 position:50% align:center
Makes me wanna go
to one in person!

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:08.802 position:50% align:center
[TANIHARA]
Shindo.

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:11.763 position:50% align:center
You've been hanging with
that Miyamura kid a lot lately.

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:14.224 position:50% align:center
I have. Your point is?

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:17.435 position:50% align:center
My point is that
I think you should stop it.

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:19.729 position:50% align:center
He's depressing and gloomy,

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:22.565 position:50% align:center
and all those piercings
make him look even weirder.

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
I've seen his type.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.276 position:50% align:center
And when they snap,

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.570 position:50% align:center
everybody better duck and
cover because shit gets crazy.

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:28.697 position:50% align:center
That's why--

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:32.826 position:50% align:center
Whose fault is it that
he's dark and gloomy?

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:35.704 position:50% align:center
[SHINDO] And I know
what's really going on.

00:16:35.787 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
You're unhappy with him

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:39.749 position:50% align:center
because you think
he's stealing me from you.

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:43.336 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.
We'll hang sometime soon.

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:56.516 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] My whole middle
school experience was changed.

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:58.351 position:50% align:center
All thanks to Shindo.

00:16:58.435 --> 00:16:59.477 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
You guys are paying, right?

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
What?

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:01.396 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
And the one who's changed

00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
my high school experience...

00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:04.899 position:50% align:center
[SHINDO] 'Cause you make it
seem like a good time.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
Pick up the pace, huh?

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
...is Hori... Hands down.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
[SOTA]
Whoa!

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:16.661 position:50% align:center
That's one high fever, Sissy!

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:18.663 position:50% align:center
And Mom already
went to work, too.

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:20.206 position:50% align:center
This is bad.

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:23.043 position:50% align:center
Hang on.

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.461 position:50% align:center
You going somewhere?

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:25.879 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
School.

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:28.590 position:50% align:center
[SOTA] You can't go to
school with a fever that high!

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:32.093 position:50% align:center
What I can't do is catch a cold
when it's still summertime.

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center
Only morons would
do something so lame.

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:35.889 position:50% align:center
But you have one.

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:38.600 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
I gotta g... Hey.

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:39.976 position:50% align:center
Gimme my bag!

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.021 position:50% align:center
The only place you're
going is back to bed, Sissy!

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
I gotta go to school.

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.107 position:50% align:center
Don't die while I'm gone, okay?

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:49.110 position:50% align:center
I won't die, silly. I promise.

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:50.779 position:50% align:center
I'll hold you to it!

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:57.243 position:50% align:center

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:13.843 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO]
I'm sorry, Kyoko,

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:16.054 position:50% align:center
but there's an
emergency at work.

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:18.056 position:50% align:center
I wish I could stay here
and be with you,

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center
but I have to go.

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:21.810 position:50% align:center

Would you like a towel?

00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Thank you.

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.245 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
No prob.

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:43.164 position:50% align:center
Let me know
when you need a dry one.

00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:45.750 position:50% align:center
And, I picked up a
sports drink for you, too.

00:18:45.834 --> 00:18:48.211 position:50% align:center
Okay. Are you real?

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Huh? I'm real.

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:53.008 position:50% align:center
Sota called me saying you
were on your deathbed,

00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:55.135 position:50% align:center
so I stopped by.

[HORI]
Gotcha.

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:01.182 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] You fully
intended to go to school,

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:02.642 position:50% align:center
even with a fever of...?

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:10.525 position:50% align:center
Somewhere around there.

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.068 position:50% align:center
Take any meds?

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:13.737 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
A little while ago.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.823 position:50% align:center
Okay. Good.

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:22.871 position:50% align:center
Change out of your uniform

Where are you going?

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:35.467 position:50% align:center
Uh. I was gonna
get you some water.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
Where are you going?

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:46.728 position:50% align:center
Listen. For real, though.

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:49.189 position:50% align:center
You need to lie down.

[HORI]
Where are you going?

00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
Tell me.

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:54.736 position:50% align:center
Kyoko.

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:57.447 position:50% align:center
You've always been so good
at toughing things out.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.741 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I take
advantage of that.

00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:02.410 position:50% align:center
Don't be.
Daddy isn't around now.

00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:04.079 position:50% align:center
And work's hard enough as it is.

00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:07.123 position:50% align:center
Plus, I'm not a
little kid anymore.

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:08.833 position:50% align:center
I'll be okay.

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
Have a good day. Mommy.

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:16.341 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Why? Why are you
never, ever, ever here?

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:18.093 position:50% align:center
Even when I need you!

00:20:18.176 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
Where are you going?

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:26.726 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
You keep asking where I'm going.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.228 position:50% align:center
It's what you say.

00:20:28.311 --> 00:20:33.858 position:50% align:center
But really, I think you mean,
"Please don't go", right?

00:20:40.824 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
Where are you going?

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.329 position:50% align:center
I'm staying right here.

00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center
Until you don't need me,

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
or get sick and tired
of looking at me,

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center
or flat out tell me to,
"buzz off."

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center
I'll stay wherever
you are, Hori.

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:58.591 position:50% align:center
I'm not going anywhere.

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:01.720 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Okay.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:07.017 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Can you promise me
you'll drink some water later?

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:16.818 position:50% align:center
That's high.

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:18.153 position:50% align:center
I called your mom

00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:20.238 position:50% align:center
and then told Ishikawa
to tell school you're sick.

00:21:24.534 --> 00:21:30.081 position:50% align:center
Also, I... I'm in love
with you, Hori.

00:21:30.165 --> 00:21:32.625 position:50% align:center
Have been for a while.

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:39.549 position:50% align:center
Anyway, there're plenty of
drinks and food in the fridge.

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:42.594 position:50% align:center
If you need anything,
call or text me.

00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:44.429 position:50% align:center
I'll come running.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:53.646 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.148 position:50% align:center
Did he really just say that?

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:57.859 position:50% align:center
He practically shocked
the fever out of my system!

00:21:57.942 --> 00:21:59.027 position:50% align:center
I'm sick and stuffed up,

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.363 position:50% align:center
and he chooses now
of all days to tell me?

00:22:01.446 --> 00:22:04.366 position:50% align:center
He knew I was awake, right?

00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:08.203 position:50% align:center
I need to know for sure
that wasn't a hallucination.

00:22:08.286 --> 00:22:11.873 position:50% align:center
But I don't wanna
make him say it again!

00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:13.291 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:17.796 position:50% align:center
I'll pretend like I was asleep
and missed what he said.

00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:22.217 position:50% align:center
That way we can stay
as we are for a little longer.
