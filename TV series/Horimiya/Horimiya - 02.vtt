00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.062 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot
for helping out today.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50% align:center
We better hurry
and get this stuff home

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.733 position:50% align:center
before Sota decides
to eat the house.

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:25.775 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:27.360 position:50% align:center
Well, he is a growing boy.

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:30.613 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:41.291 position:50% align:center
[singing in Japanese]

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:42.334 position:50% align:center
Anime fan?

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:43.793 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Hmm?!

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:45.503 position:50% align:center
Wait. Was I singing?

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:46.629 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Mm-hmm.

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:48.673 position:50% align:center
You've got a nice
set of pipes on ya, Hori.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.717 position:50% align:center
I definitely do not!

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:53.595 position:50% align:center
I just sang an anime
theme song in public.

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:55.180 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.265 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] What's wrong
with liking anime music?

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:59.309 position:50% align:center
Nothing if that's
what you're into.

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:01.144 position:50% align:center
It is not my thing though.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:02.604 position:50% align:center
But Sota's all about it,

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:05.899 position:50% align:center
and he plays it so much
even I know the lyrics now.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.233 position:50% align:center
That's fair enough.

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:09.194 position:50% align:center
So what music do you like?

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.781 position:50% align:center
What I like? Let me think.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.492 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
I have no idea what's popular!

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.411 position:50% align:center
But I know all the words
to a friggin' anime theme!

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:19.788 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Hmm.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.958 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm home!

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.210 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO]
Welcome back!

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.504 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:29.714 position:50% align:center
Hold up. Mom?

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.549 position:50% align:center
Hi!

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.560 position:50% align:center
Oh-ho. So I take it you've
been having lots of fun

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.062 position:50% align:center
with this new friend.

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
[SOTA]
Uh-huh! Sure have.

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:11.149 position:50% align:center
He comes over all the
time to play with me!

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.151 position:50% align:center
He even bought me
this neat book!

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.779 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO]
Well that was nice of him!

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.864 position:50% align:center
And nice of you
to bring him around!

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:21.326 position:50% align:center
So what's he like? Is he cute?

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
Actually, he kinda reminds me
of the dark and twisted villain

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:27.082 position:50% align:center
you'd find in a detective movie.

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO] Uh. That's a strange
description for someone

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.381 position:50% align:center
who's friends with both you
and your younger brother.

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:37.050 position:50% align:center
Strange, but true.

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:40.303 position:50% align:center
Either way, I'd love to talk
with him one-on-one sometime!

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
I see no logical reason
for that to happen!

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.474 position:50% align:center
'Kay. All done.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
Ahh! Thank you, Kyoko!
That felt great!

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:51.523 position:50% align:center
So, anyway.
This boy have a name?

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:52.524 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:55.151 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO]
Your dark villain.

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:57.153 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah, his name's Miyamura.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:58.321 position:50% align:center
That's his last name?

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center
Yeah. His first name is... Uh...

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.327 position:50% align:center
What is Miaymura's first name?

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:05.995 position:50% align:center
I have no clue.

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:12.502 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
This is insane.

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:15.380 position:50% align:center
He's been coming over to
my house for forever and a day,

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:19.050 position:50% align:center
and I never thought
to ask what his first name is!

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:22.220 position:50% align:center
Why'd our teacher have to take
the attendance sheet with him?

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:28.184 position:50% align:center
[HORI] No harm in outright
asking, is there?

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
Hey! So, uh, Miyamura!

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:33.690 position:50% align:center
You don't have
a first name, do you?

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:35.275 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:36.484 position:50% align:center
Nope! Not happening!

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:38.778 position:50% align:center
That's the absolute last way
I should figure this out!

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50% align:center
Let's go get changed for gym.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.993 position:50% align:center
[IURA] Miyamura. You know
what we're doing today?

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:46.953 position:50% align:center
I think it's a combined class.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:48.580 position:50% align:center
--[HORI exhales]
--[IURA] Huh?

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:51.082 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Somebody,
call him by his first name!

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
C'mon, boys!

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.293 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.628 position:50% align:center
Hori's been watching us
get undressed!

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
What's with her?

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:58.048 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.424 position:50% align:center
Why would you peep on them?

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.051 position:50% align:center
You frustrated or what?

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.302 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.471 position:50% align:center
[shrieks]

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
Damn it all.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
If he were a little
bit smarter, I'd know!

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:19.944 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Yo. You heading home?

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:22.655 position:50% align:center
Hey, Toru! Your timing
couldn't be better!

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:23.698 position:50% align:center
It's about Miyamura.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.699 position:50% align:center
I was wondering if you--

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.120 position:50% align:center
My heart's still in
the process of healing.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.955 position:50% align:center
Give me time.

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:35.919 position:50% align:center
Wait! Some help you are!

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.088 position:50% align:center
Who knew trying to find out
a person's first name

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
would be so exhausting.

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:42.133 position:50% align:center
Kyoko, what's wrong, huh?

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.844 position:50% align:center
I hope the curry's not putting
that sour look on your face.

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
[HORI] We've had microwave
curry three days in a row.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey!

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:50.850 position:50% align:center
There's no school tomorrow,
if memory serves.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.769 position:50% align:center
Is your friend coming?

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.312 position:50% align:center
Um, probably.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.356 position:50% align:center
[YURIKO inhales]
You think so?

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:59.943 position:50% align:center
Oh! That's great!
I'm really excited now!

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:00.985 position:50% align:center
It's not like he's
not coming over here

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:03.405 position:50% align:center
to hang out with you, y'know.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:04.572 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.783 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Wait! There's a good
chance he'll tell Mom his name!

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:08.159 position:50% align:center
Got 'im!

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:11.329 position:50% align:center
[door bell rings]

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:15.959 position:50% align:center
You're finally here!
So nice to meet you.

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.795 position:50% align:center
Don't be shy, please! Come in!

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.381 position:50% align:center
Um, thank you.

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:24.134 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Wow. This must be Hori's mom!

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:25.719 position:50% align:center
What a surprise.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50% align:center
Uh. I brought some sweets.

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:30.306 position:50% align:center
You did? So thoughtful!

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.435 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but Kyoko isn't here.

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:36.187 position:50% align:center
She's out and about
running some errands right now.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.940 position:50% align:center
She's told me so much
about you, though.

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:40.650 position:50% align:center
--[SOTA] Hi, Mom!
--Ah!

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:42.193 position:50% align:center
He's home late today.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.779 position:50% align:center
Hey! How you been, Bro?

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:46.031 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:48.491 position:50% align:center
That name really suits you!

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:50.035 position:50% align:center
I would love to stay and chat.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center
Honest. But, I sadly have
to get back to work.

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:54.456 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
That's okay.

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:56.124 position:50% align:center
I'll be heading out soon, too.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.542 position:50% align:center
[SOTA]
You're leaving already?

00:06:57.584 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50% align:center
But you just got here!

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.046 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA chuckles]
Yeah.

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
I appreciate you
helping out when you can.

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
Well, sure.

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.554 position:50% align:center
Huh? Where'd Mom go?

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:13.350 position:50% align:center
Where else? She's at work.

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:15.060 position:50% align:center
So, which one you wanna eat?

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.144 position:50% align:center
Strawberry, please!

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
That witch of a woman!

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:19.314 position:50% align:center
She wanted her stupid
one-on-one time with him,

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:21.066 position:50% align:center
so she sent me on errands!

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.318 position:50% align:center
Man, the last time someone
called me my first name,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.861 position:50% align:center
I was in the sixth grade.

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:27.113 position:50% align:center
It felt kinda weird.

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:28.990 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Wait. What?

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
Talking about your mom.

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.368 position:50% align:center
She used my first name.

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:32.535 position:50% align:center
That's not what I meant!

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.621 position:50% align:center
Do you mean how she used it?

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:36.414 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:37.749 position:50% align:center
Just as a greeting.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
She didn't use it
that much. But still...

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:42.587 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Have the two of us
ever had a conversation

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50% align:center
where we were
both on the same page?

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.508 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.760 position:50% align:center
That's not what I meant either!

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:52.222 position:50% align:center
You know, recently, you've
been acting really strange.

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:54.140 position:50% align:center
Me? What? No way!

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:57.602 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Well, watching guys
change clothes is pretty weird.

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
But, I had a reason for that.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:03.024 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Hori.

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:04.401 position:50% align:center
Do you have a crush?

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.240 position:50% align:center

No.

[laughs]

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:17.080 position:50% align:center
Wait, my name?

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:19.332 position:50% align:center
That's what you've been
so worried about?

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
All because of a stupid name.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.752 position:50% align:center
You are something else!

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center
That's one of the
lamest things I've ever heard!

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:26.756 position:50% align:center
Excuse me for not
knowing how to ask you!

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:29.217 position:50% align:center
I'm stealing
your pen real quick.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
Gimme a sec.

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
[SOTA]
And lame-o was her name-oh!

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:32.804 position:50% align:center
Sis! That hurts!

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.931 position:50% align:center
Stop! Cut it out! Please!

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:41.396 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Izumi Miyamura.

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:44.024 position:50% align:center
Ah! Forgot! Pronunciation.

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:44.441 position:50% align:center
Give it back.

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:45.650 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
I can pronounce it!

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
Well, I'll go ahead
and hang on to this note.

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.698 position:50% align:center
Just in case I forget it again.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center
Aw, that sucks.

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:54.325 position:50% align:center
Is my name really
that forgettable?

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
No! I said just in case!

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:59.164 position:50% align:center
You'll remember it
easier if you say it!

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
Ee... Izumi.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:06.004 position:50% align:center
Right. There ya go.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.469 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
That felt super awkward.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.512 position:50% align:center
I'll just keep
calling you Miyamura!

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:17.307 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Jeez! What was that for, Hori?

00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
Wait, hold the phone!

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:21.436 position:50% align:center
You're as clueless about my
first name as I was about yours!

00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:23.772 position:50% align:center
No. It's Kyoko?

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:28.568 position:50% align:center
[HORI] The hole I'm digging
keeps getting deeper!

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.404 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Hori says
the dumbest things sometimes.

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:34.366 position:50% align:center
Ugh! What are you waiting for,
go ahead and laugh!

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.618 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] I'm good.
You'll just get mad if I laugh.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center
You're damn right I will!

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.164 position:50% align:center
You don't play fair!

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:49.464 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. Really.

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:51.925 position:50% align:center
I can only imagine
how busy you are.

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.301 position:50% align:center
It's totally cool!

00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:55.553 position:50% align:center
I'd do anything
for you, Sengoku.

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:58.264 position:50% align:center
Thanks. You're a true lifesaver.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
Sakura. I trust
you'll handle these.

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.436 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:04.938 position:50% align:center
It's amazing how
much smoother things go

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.940 position:50% align:center
when you've got
capable people on the job.

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.817 position:50% align:center
Huh. Yeah. I guess so.

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:10.443 position:50% align:center
Which is why, if you don't mind.

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:13.905 position:50% align:center
I, uh, I have another favor
I'd like to ask of you.

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:14.989 position:50% align:center
What?

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:17.158 position:50% align:center
Please? I know
it's inconvenient.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
But we're only asking

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:20.704 position:50% align:center
because the student council
has so much to do!

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:22.580 position:50% align:center
You're good.

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:23.873 position:50% align:center
I know how it can be, so, yeah!

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:25.333 position:50% align:center
No worries.

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50% align:center
Your eyes! Girl!

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.466 position:50% align:center
Are they bad?

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center
This what the student council
dumped off on you?

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.014 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] Why are
you stuck doing their work?

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.100 position:50% align:center
You're not one of them.

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
They have a lot of new members,

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:45.937 position:50% align:center
so they're having a hard time
getting things done.

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.731 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Simple as that, huh?

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:48.815 position:50% align:center
It just feels kinda messed up

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:50.942 position:50% align:center
that they have you
do such important stuff.

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:53.361 position:50% align:center
It's like they're using you
and you don't even care.

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center
Because I don't care.

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.364 position:50% align:center
It's just they need
the extra help.

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] That's the thing!
You should care!

00:10:58.616 --> 00:10:59.993 position:50% align:center
Hori's got it pretty rough.

00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:01.453 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Mm.

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:04.330 position:50% align:center
As for us. We stand
on the sidelines and watch

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:06.458 position:50% align:center
'cause we're too stupid
to do anything else.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:07.876 position:50% align:center
The truth hurts.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.711 position:50% align:center
At least we
recognize it, though.

00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:11.421 position:50% align:center
And the prez's at
the top of the class.

00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:13.131 position:50% align:center
He is?

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:15.383 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] He's got a
fairly big fan club, too.

00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:17.761 position:50% align:center
It's highly possible
Hori's only helping him out

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
because she secretly likes him.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:29.981 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI]
Yoo-hoo! Hori!

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:32.817 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Oh! Hey, Ayasaki!

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
Here are the files
and notebooks I worked on.

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:42.535 position:50% align:center
Be careful since they're heavy.

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
Remi will be! Thanks, Hori!

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
That pink-haired princess
is drop-dead gorgeous!

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:51.002 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] And she's also
President Sengoku's girlfriend.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.671 position:50% align:center
It's no fair when
two hotties date!

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:55.215 position:50% align:center
[HORI] Ayasaki's another
member of the council.

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:58.051 position:50% align:center
I don't think she
does much work, though.

00:11:58.093 --> 00:11:59.928 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] She's more
like a mascot than anything.

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
Wait! So what you're saying is,

00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:03.807 position:50% align:center
they're pushing all this
hot chick's work on Hori?

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
Toru, please.
Don't put it like that.

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center
Because it's not
too far from the truth.

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:11.231 position:50% align:center
The work I just
did was Ayasaki's.

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:12.691 position:50% align:center
[ALL 3]
They're 100 percent using her,

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.901 position:50% align:center
and she's okay with it?

00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:22.409 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.911 position:50% align:center
Welp. I think
I'm gonna head home.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
Bye.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
Is she actually all right?
I hope so.

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:36.631 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Cake makes people feel better.

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll bake her one.

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:43.304 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!
You didn't get hurt, did you?

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.223 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI groans]

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:47.642 position:50% align:center
Hey! Watch where
you're going, jerkface!

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:50.395 position:50% align:center
Huh? But you're
the one who ran into me.

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:53.148 position:50% align:center
Why're you sitting there
when you could help?

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.692 position:50% align:center
Sakura's gonna yell at me
again for being late,

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:58.194 position:50% align:center
and it's not even Remi's fault!

00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:01.197 position:50% align:center
Wait up! Hey!

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:03.074 position:50% align:center
[AYASAKI] Whatever it is
it can't be that important

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:04.576 position:50% align:center
so throw it out for me, okay?

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:05.452 position:50% align:center
Buh-bye!

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:08.621 position:50% align:center
[shrieks]

00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:12.208 position:50% align:center
Guess I know what talking
with a pink wall feels like now.

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:37.567 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:40.487 position:50% align:center
What gives?

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:41.529 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
I told you,

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.616 position:50% align:center
I gave you every single
page that I worked on!

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:47.577 position:50% align:center
[KONO] So you say.
But there are pages missing.

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:50.163 position:50% align:center
And we haven't been able
to find them anywhere.

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:51.956 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
What's this about?

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.125 position:50% align:center
Miyamura!
Thank goodness you're here!

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.086 position:50% align:center
Please help! It's Hori.

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:57.170 position:50% align:center
What's Hori?

00:13:57.212 --> 00:13:58.463 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] The student
council's giving her flack

00:13:58.505 --> 00:13:59.756 position:50% align:center
for some reason.

00:14:00.924 --> 00:14:03.134 position:50% align:center
I returned everything
you gave me yesterday!

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:05.345 position:50% align:center
The budget paperwork
should've been in there, too!

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:08.932 position:50% align:center
Ask Ayasaki! She saw it!

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:11.768 position:50% align:center
Remi already said that
she didn't see it there.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.061 position:50% align:center
Did you double check,

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:15.105 position:50% align:center
or is there a chance
you could be mistaken?

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:17.023 position:50% align:center
Well, either way,
you guys are...

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:17.982 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
...still at fault.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.401 position:50% align:center
And, of course,
you have a point.

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:21.778 position:50% align:center
That is, if the
missing budget report

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
was actually in that pile.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.282 position:50% align:center
You have no one to blame
but yourself otherwise.

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:27.283 position:50% align:center
So tell me,

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:28.868 position:50% align:center
do you know for
certain it was there?

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.954 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:34.791 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Yes, I do.

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:36.251 position:50% align:center
But to be honest,

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.545 position:50% align:center
I was so tired,
I can't remember.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.296 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Wow. Hori screwed up.

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:41.673 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT I]
Isn't she in Class 1?

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:42.924 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B]
So how far behind are they,

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:45.260 position:50% align:center
now that she lost those reports?

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:46.261 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
I don't know.

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:48.972 position:50% align:center
But I feel super sorry
for the president.

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:50.640 position:50% align:center
So if this is
in fact your fault,

00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:52.434 position:50% align:center
all I want is an
apology from you.

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:53.935 position:50% align:center
Is that so hard?

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.980 position:50% align:center
Shut it, asshole!

00:14:57.022 --> 00:14:58.857 position:50% align:center
You're only making things worse!

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.025 position:50% align:center
Leave her alone!

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.735 position:50% align:center
Hori finished
that budget report!

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:03.737 position:50% align:center
I know because I saw her do it!

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:06.156 position:50% align:center
I also saw her turning it in!

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:10.118 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT C] All she has
to do is apologize to him.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.161 position:50% align:center
What's the big deal?

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:14.039 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT D] Three syllables
should not be this hard to say.

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:15.707 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Ishikawa.

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:16.833 position:50% align:center
Gonna hold me back, too?

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:19.461 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Actually, I was
hoping you could do the holding.

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
This shouldn't take too long.

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:24.632 position:50% align:center
Go ahead. It's your move.

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50% align:center
I...

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
...don't have to apologize.

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:34.225 position:50% align:center
Hori. You don't owe
them a thing.

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:35.977 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:41.441 position:50% align:center
And what do you want?

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:42.901 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Mister President.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.825 position:50% align:center
[shocked screams]

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:52.535 position:50% align:center
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:54.954 position:50% align:center
Aw! My poor Sengoku!

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:57.791 position:50% align:center
Just so you know,
violence is unacceptable!

00:15:57.832 --> 00:15:59.292 position:50% align:center
What possessed you
to do such a--

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:00.543 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:02.921 position:50% align:center
Is this the report
that went missing?

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.798 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Yeah. That's the one.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.299 position:50% align:center
But why do you have it?

00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:09.094 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] It was left
behind in the hall yesterday.

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:12.013 position:50% align:center
Ayasaki said I should trash it
because it wasn't important.

00:16:12.055 --> 00:16:14.224 position:50% align:center
Remi said no such thing! Oh!

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:26.194 position:50% align:center
Oh... Guess that did happen.

00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:32.701 position:50% align:center
Reeeemiiii...

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:40.709 position:50% align:center
You guys! I am so sorry!

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.420 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT E] So they accused Hori
even though she didn't do it.

00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:45.171 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT F]
What even happened?

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.506 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT G]
Who knows?

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
[HORI] All's well that
ends well, as they say.

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:06.026 position:50% align:center
Five more seconds and
I would've been in tears.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:07.861 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] Anybody who
has their crap together like you

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:09.404 position:50% align:center
would never do that.

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:10.947 position:50% align:center
Aw, thank you.

00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:12.032 position:50% align:center
Though I guess the one

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
I should really be
grateful for is Miyamura.

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:15.660 position:50% align:center
So thanks!

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:17.162 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:18.663 position:50% align:center
I'm glad it worked out.

00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:19.956 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
One question:

00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:22.334 position:50% align:center
If you had the missing
report the entire time,

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.169 position:50% align:center
why'd you need to
headbutt the president?

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.837 position:50% align:center
I didn't need to.

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
He was just really
pissing me off.

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:31.843 position:50% align:center
While we're on the topic.

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:32.844 position:50% align:center
I've been wondering.

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:35.221 position:50% align:center
Does the president
have any dirt on you, Hori?

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.475 position:50% align:center
I mean, if the guy
asks you to do something,

00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:40.101 position:50% align:center
you do it without
a second thought.

00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:40.894 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:42.854 position:50% align:center
--Yeah, why?
--Yeah, why?

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:44.022 position:50% align:center
Hori.

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
Don't "Hori" me.

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.609 position:50% align:center
It's because the student
council's so busy,

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.777 position:50% align:center
and I really wanna help!

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:50.111 position:50% align:center
Sengoku's my friend.

00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:53.073 position:50% align:center
So it's just one
childhood pal helping another.

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:54.908 position:50% align:center
Boo-hoo!

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:56.868 position:50% align:center
You're the biggest
crybaby I know!

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.662 position:50% align:center
Stop! You're hurting me, Kyoko!

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:02.457 position:50% align:center
Peas're the grossest things
in the whole world!

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
[HORI, SENGOKU]
Rock paper scissors!

00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:05.877 position:50% align:center
The moment
we get to high school,

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:08.129 position:50% align:center
I promise you my
dog days will be done!

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:12.634 position:50% align:center
Is that a fact? You think
of yourself as my dog?

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
Wow. Who knew?

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
Laugh now, but you'll
grow to respect me!

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.641 position:50% align:center
I'll have a normal,
happy time in high school!

00:18:19.683 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center
You'll see!

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:21.309 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Oh, I will?

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:22.769 position:50% align:center
If you try to tear me down,

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:25.146 position:50% align:center
I'll tell everyone how much
you bullied me in the past!

00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
Ha! Bullied?

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:28.233 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
Yes, bullied!

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
You're doing it right now!

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
That's taunting, not bullying.

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:35.532 position:50% align:center
But that said,
you do have a point there.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
All right then.

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:40.286 position:50% align:center
Come high school, we're equals.

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:46.209 position:50% align:center
[exhales]
Seriously, guys.

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:48.336 position:50% align:center
I've known that kid for forever!

00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:50.672 position:50% align:center
[ALL 3]
He definitely has dirt on her.

00:18:56.594 --> 00:19:00.056 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Oh hey! Good morning, Prez.

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:04.519 position:50% align:center
And good morning
to you, too! Sir!

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:07.147 position:50% align:center
[HORI] I may have
recovered from that day,

00:19:07.188 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
but Sengoku was traumatized.

00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:20.452 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
Miyamura,

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:23.121 position:50% align:center
did you know Hori's birthday
is just around the corner?

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:24.914 position:50% align:center
Well... I do now.

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:27.083 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
March 25th, to be exact.

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:29.919 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Ah. So it's during spring break.

00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] I'm on the fence
about getting her something.

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:34.674 position:50% align:center
You know,
how annoying would it be

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:36.718 position:50% align:center
to get a gift from
the guy she rejected.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.970 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] I don't think
she'd find it annoying.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:40.930 position:50% align:center
'Cause, I mean, why would she?

00:19:40.972 --> 00:19:42.057 position:50% align:center
It's her birthday.

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:43.224 position:50% align:center
But then problem
number two is that

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:46.269 position:50% align:center
I have no earthly idea
what to get her.

00:19:46.311 --> 00:19:48.188 position:50% align:center
Thought that counts.

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:50.106 position:50% align:center
So get her whatever.

00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:51.107 position:50% align:center
Maybe jewelry?

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:53.568 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Jewelry from
the dude she turned down?

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.195 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] What about
something for her desk?

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:55.987 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
I thought if anyone knew

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:58.073 position:50% align:center
what kind of stuff she likes,
it would be you!

00:19:58.114 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Umm...

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:03.495 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]If I was gonna
give Hori a present,

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:05.413 position:50% align:center
what would I give her?

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:19.260 position:50% align:center
Hey! Since it's spring break,

00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:23.098 position:50% align:center
do you think my bro will come
and visit every single day?

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:25.392 position:50% align:center
I don't think
he'll come here every day.

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:27.560 position:50% align:center
Just keep in mind
that eventually

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:29.813 position:50% align:center
he's going to stop
visiting us altogether.

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:33.358 position:50% align:center
Aw. Well, when is
that gonna be, sissy?

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.110 position:50% align:center
When you graduate high school?

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:41.741 position:50% align:center
[HORI] When will Miyamura
stop coming to my house?

00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:43.201 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:46.204 position:50% align:center
I wish I could tell you,
but I can't.

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:48.581 position:50% align:center
[SOTA] Just wondering,
but do you think you'll be sad

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center
when he stops visiting?

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:53.044 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be super sad!

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.007 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hori.

00:20:57.048 --> 00:20:58.758 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me, too.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.427 position:50% align:center
I'll be pretty bummed out!

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:04.848 position:50% align:center
You could be a little more
honest, if you ask me.

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
What do you know?

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:08.184 position:50% align:center
[SOTA laughs]

00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:14.899 position:50% align:center
Happy birthday!

00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:16.484 position:50% align:center
And may you have many more!

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:18.945 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! It is my birthday!

00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:22.115 position:50% align:center
I totally forgot about it
because we were on spring break!

00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:23.450 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh!

00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:25.201 position:50% align:center
Here, this one's from me.

00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:27.203 position:50% align:center
Happy birthday.

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:32.125 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
A CD of the best pop songs!

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:34.627 position:50% align:center
This is what people our
age are listening to, right?

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:35.545 position:50% align:center
Awesome!

00:21:35.587 --> 00:21:40.133 position:50% align:center
Well, they're the
ones I like, at least.

00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:42.927 position:50% align:center
It's very sweet, thanks so much.

00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:46.848 position:50% align:center
How strange.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.683 position:50% align:center
I didn't say a word,

00:21:48.725 --> 00:21:51.853 position:50% align:center
but he somehow knew
this was what I wanted.

00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:53.563 position:50% align:center
Such a weirdo.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.364 position:50% align:center
Since today's my birthday,

00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:05.116 position:50% align:center
that means spring
break's almost over.

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:10.288 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:22:19.673 --> 00:22:21.675 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Guess we'll be third years soon.
