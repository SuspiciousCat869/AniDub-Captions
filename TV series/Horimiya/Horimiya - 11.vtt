00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:17.600 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.729 position:50% align:center
We have a lot of only
children in our group, huh?

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:22.605 position:50% align:center
[ALL 3]
Um...

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.566 position:50% align:center
Nobody else has a
little brother but me.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:26.943 position:50% align:center
I have my big sister, Miki.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.696 position:50% align:center
I guess that's pretty much it.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.072 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but what's most shocking

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
about our posse is that
Shu's also an older sibling.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.910 position:50% align:center
[shocked noises]

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:37.746 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
What? Did none of you know?

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.039 position:50% align:center
--[HORI] A sister?
--[YOSHIKAWA] A brother?

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:40.498 position:50% align:center
--[MIYAMURA] Or a sister?
--[HORI] Two brothers?

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:41.666 position:50% align:center
--[YOSHIKAWA] Two sisters?
--[MIYAMURA] Five brothers?

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.793 position:50% align:center
Jeez! It's not that many,
so calm down.

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:46.504 position:50% align:center
A few days ago, he invited
me over to hang and,

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
incidentally, I found out.

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:51.009 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
I'm back!

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:52.844 position:50% align:center
'Preciate you having me.

00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:57.807 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
It's fine.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.601 position:50% align:center
Just try to keep quiet.

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:00.602 position:50% align:center
Roger that.

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:02.437 position:50% align:center
And don't touch me.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:07.025 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hey there.

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.111 position:50% align:center
Baby sis?

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.614 position:50% align:center
Yup. Three years younger.

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:15.283 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] I thought a blood
relative might be different.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:18.328 position:50% align:center
Hooray!
Welcome home, big brother!

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.623 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] They look alike, but
she treated him kinda... cold.

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:22.749 position:50% align:center
Get out.

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:24.751 position:50% align:center
Iura being a
big brother is nuts.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:27.170 position:50% align:center
You learn something
new every day!

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.839 position:50% align:center
He's fairly chill when he's
not at school. Weird, right?

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.133 position:50% align:center
Whoa. That's hard to picture.

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:34.719 position:50% align:center
'Sup, nerds?

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:37.847 position:50% align:center
Let's go eat our weight in
burgers after class, okay?

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:43.269 position:50% align:center
You need to start acting
more responsibly, sheesh!

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.605 position:50% align:center
Huuuuh?

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
Psych! Just kidding!

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center
[group laughing]

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.119 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
You're such a clown, Shu.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50% align:center
Wow, Iura is quite the comedian.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.001 position:50% align:center
You always speak formally.

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:31.628 position:50% align:center
Like, you use zero slang.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.129 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.631 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you've been
super polite to us

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.216 position:50% align:center
since the first day we met.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.093 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Old habit.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.136 position:50% align:center
I heard you loosen it up
with Yuki, though.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.596 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.681 position:50% align:center
What? Really?

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:45.183 position:50% align:center
Yeah! For example.

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:46.476 position:50% align:center
Bye-bye!

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.645 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yes. Bye.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.898 position:50% align:center
Yanagin, say "Bye-bye"!

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:52.941 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:56.236 position:50% align:center
Yanagin! Bye-bye!

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:00.990 position:50% align:center
Okay. Bye-bye.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.534 position:50% align:center
Remi can't believe you said it!

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50% align:center
You are so cute!

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.162 position:50% align:center
[HORI] That girl is a
force to be reckoned with.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50% align:center
No doubt about it.

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:09.874 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
Thanks for waiting.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:10.959 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:12.168 position:50% align:center
Just entertaining myself

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.129 position:50% align:center
watching Ayasaki
mess with Yanagi.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:15.463 position:50% align:center
Ahh.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
Oh! So are you girls
heading home, too?

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
Bye-bye!

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.552 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Bye. See you guys around.

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.345 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:25.015 position:50% align:center
Ciao.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.766 position:50% align:center
Catch ya later.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Hm.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
See?

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.273 position:50% align:center
Huh, wonder why.

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.650 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
It's not exactly rocket science.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.110 position:50% align:center
Hey, here's an idea!

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:39.696 position:50% align:center
You could always call everyone
by their first name!

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.323 position:50% align:center
'N' I'll start using
your first name, too!

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center
It's times like these

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
I really envy Iura's
peppy personality.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:49.706 position:50% align:center
"Hey, Akane"! Now you go.

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.166 position:50% align:center
I'm really not sure.

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.085 position:50% align:center
I've never once used
a friend's first name before.

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.588 position:50% align:center
Sorry. But this might
be hard for me.

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center
C'mon, man!
At least throw in a "dude"!

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:00.925 position:50% align:center
No more politeness,
starting now!

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.594 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
What?

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:06.765 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
Ouch!

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50% align:center
Knock it off, you're
obviously bothering him.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:12.604 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI] Oh, no. He's
certainly not, I assure you.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:15.940 position:50% align:center
Because, well, I, too,
recognize the fact

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:18.526 position:50% align:center
that I'm not close with anybody.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.197 position:50% align:center
That I use my words
to keep others at a distance.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.698 position:50% align:center
But that's not to say
I wouldn't like to become

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:25.575 position:50% align:center
better friends with you all.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:28.620 position:50% align:center
On the contrary,
I'd like that very much.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:31.206 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
Hm?

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.168 position:50% align:center
Was there a meeting I didn't get
the memo for or something?

00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:37.170 position:50% align:center
He's also a new addition
to the friend group,

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:39.172 position:50% align:center
and he started things off
way worse than you!

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
I hated his guts,
now look how close we are!

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.426 position:50% align:center
Eh?

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.427 position:50% align:center
You couldn't
pay me to snuggle up

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:45.637 position:50% align:center
with the prez like that.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.347 position:50% align:center
Not in a million years.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.973 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
Those two are amazing.

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50% align:center
They sapped Iura's energy
in one fell swoop!

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50% align:center
Go on and explain to Yanagi
what good buddies we are!

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.564 position:50% align:center
Umm.

00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:58.608 position:50% align:center
All it took was a
little AC and ice cream!

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:00.318 position:50% align:center
What the heck
are you talking about?

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:03.863 position:50% align:center
We, er, are really brothers
from another mother!

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
Yanagi's in that
brotherhood, too!

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
That's why I voted for you!

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:08.535 position:50% align:center
Boys are weird.

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:10.995 position:50% align:center
And that's my cue
to go find Yuki.

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:13.623 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] I've never felt
closer to you, Prez.

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
[play fighting continues]

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.796 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
Brotherhood.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.382 position:50% align:center
Rock paper scissors settles
any argument with your bros.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:24.050 position:50% align:center
That doesn't always work,
and you know it!

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:25.093 position:50% align:center
Don't listen to him.

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:26.636 position:50% align:center
His skills at
that game are trash.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.930 position:50% align:center
You lose ten
times more than I do!

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:30.473 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll have to try.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.017 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.602 position:50% align:center
Aw, I thought I was pretty
good at rock paper scissors.

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] You're there
every time you lose.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.230 position:50% align:center
Count the number of trips

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:38.690 position:50% align:center
that you've taken
to the vending machine.

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.443 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Then,
I'll make it a point to win.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.570 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
Um, Ishikawa?

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.030 position:50% align:center
If it's all right with you.

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:46.990 position:50% align:center
I'd like to try
calling you Toru.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.783 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:54.122 position:50% align:center
Akane! What about me, bro?

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:55.165 position:50% align:center
One at a time!

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
Best to take things
like this slow!

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.377 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
Okay, but I wanna be next!

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:01.046 position:50% align:center
Does it go both ways?

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:03.631 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna start calling him
by his first name, too?

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:05.050 position:50% align:center
Be kinda lame if I didn't.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:07.177 position:50% align:center
Don't want him being
the only one, right?

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.554 position:50% align:center
Wasn't that what started
this conversation?

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:11.348 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.642 position:50% align:center
Nothing at all.

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.853 position:50% align:center
I have a personal
blacklist, y'know.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
And Yanagi's on it. For now.

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU] Why? What'd a pure
soul like him ever do to you?

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:23.234 position:50% align:center
Just a joke.

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:24.569 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
What?

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
Forget I said it.

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:29.616 position:50% align:center
You really need to work
on your sense of humor.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
Miyamura.

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:38.124 position:50% align:center
I won't take them away.

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
And what exactly
are these things

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.878 position:50% align:center
that you won't be
taking from him?

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.463 position:50% align:center
Has he mugged you before?

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:46.174 position:50% align:center
Is that the reason
he's on your blacklist?

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.470 position:50% align:center
Stop! Leave me alone!

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
C'mon, out with it!

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:57.102 position:50% align:center
You dummy!

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
You're king dummy, Akane!

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:01.815 position:50% align:center
[sobs]

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:02.899 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
Bye...?

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.067 position:50% align:center
And there he goes.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.653 position:50% align:center
That strange, beautiful boy.

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:09.864 position:50% align:center
You happy cause
he used your first name?

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.746 position:50% align:center
Just accept that
you're wrong already.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.623 position:50% align:center
I'm not! Look!

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:20.208 position:50% align:center
How 'bout a third opinion?

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.127 position:50% align:center
Well, it couldn't hurt.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.379 position:50% align:center
I know the answer is me,
so tell him that I'm taller.

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:26.589 position:50% align:center
No. We're clearly
the same height.

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
Is this stemming
from some kind of fight?

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:30.635 position:50% align:center
It's stemming from
Akane approaching me

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:32.971 position:50% align:center
and declaring that he
had a random growth spurt.

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:34.264 position:50% align:center
He doesn't believe it

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.932 position:50% align:center
even though the proof's right
in front of him!

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:37.308 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
So you are fighting.

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center
There's nothing to fight about!

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.311 position:50% align:center
You can't debate
something that's fact!

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:41.896 position:50% align:center
Neither one
of us reach 170,

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.232 position:50% align:center
but when I said that,
he got mad at me!

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:47.110 position:50% align:center
It's such a petty thing
to get upset over, Miyamura.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:50.071 position:50% align:center
Though Yanagi getting
defensive was juvenile, too.

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:54.534 position:50% align:center
I apologize.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:56.244 position:50% align:center
Hey! I screwed up first!

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
I'm way more apologetic!

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.248 position:50% align:center
Did I speak out of turn?
I'm sorry.

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.458 position:50% align:center
You did it again!

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:02.500 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI] I'll reflect
on my wrongdoings...

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:03.710 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
I'm not sure how it happened,

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:06.463 position:50% align:center
but I'm glad these two
are such close friends.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:07.589 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Dammit, Akane!

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:09.132 position:50% align:center
[YANAGI]
Yes?

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.597 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
How do you feel about this one?

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.473 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
Hm?

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:17.557 position:50% align:center
[SAWADA]
Normal.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.684 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
And this one?

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:20.727 position:50% align:center
[SAWADA]
Normal.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:21.853 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
Wow.

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:23.730 position:50% align:center
That's some massive
improvement there.

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
Yo. We're human beings,
not inanimate objects.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.651 position:50% align:center
--Get it straight.
--Yes. Please do.

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:31.029 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I was just testing
Sawada's comfort level

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:32.364 position:50% align:center
when she's around guys.

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:34.282 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU]
Ahh...

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:36.409 position:50% align:center
[SAWADA] Now, I can push
my limit to Sengoku.

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:39.204 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] Wait. So where do
I rank on this little chart?

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.247 position:50% align:center
Heh, sweet!

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
Hey. You want some snacks?

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU chuckles]

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.174 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA grunts]

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:52.717 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA]
So you're a chocolate-lover?

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:54.094 position:50% align:center
Then get a load of this.

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:57.138 position:50% align:center
You can have as
many as you want!

00:09:57.222 --> 00:09:58.682 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.558 position:50% align:center
Literally eating out
of the palm of my hand!

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:02.435 position:50% align:center
[SENGOKU growls]

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:03.561 position:50% align:center
I'll shake up that
tier list if it's...

00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:05.563 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA]
It's not a contest.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.441 position:50% align:center
Whatever you do,
don't open your mouth!

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center
It's all that I ask!

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:11.486 position:50% align:center
What? Speak up!

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:15.198 position:50% align:center
This ain't a library,
it's a hallway!

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.033 position:50% align:center
--Salutations, Sawada!
--[SAWADA] Nope!

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.493 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
Uh, what're you hiding for?

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:19.869 position:50% align:center
You know who I am.

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:22.956 position:50% align:center
It's called tact.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.040 position:50% align:center
Please try and learn it.

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:25.500 position:50% align:center
Wait. What?

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:27.627 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:32.090 position:50% align:center
Sawada. Iura's
actually a nice guy.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.342 position:50% align:center
You can trust him.

00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:35.885 position:50% align:center
Miyamura!

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
So what?

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:38.930 position:50% align:center
Whether he identifies
as a good guy or a bad guy

00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:40.974 position:50% align:center
was never the issue at hand.

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:44.144 position:50% align:center
I gave it my best shot,
but I guess it's no dice.

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:46.730 position:50% align:center
[SAWADA] Annoying loudmouths
are the absolute worst.

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:56.156 position:50% align:center
[IURA coughs]

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
Feels like
I swallowed sandpaper.

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center
What?
You coming down with a cold?

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
You do keep coughing.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:05.248 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
Mm... Nah...

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.334 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure I'm
just losing my voice.

00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:10.211 position:50% align:center
Long as you're not fatigued,
you should be okay.

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:12.922 position:50% align:center
Actually, I am kinda fatigued.

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
Why're you here if you're sick?!

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.885 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you definitely
have a fever!

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:17.927 position:50% align:center
Why're you manhandling me?

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.596 position:50% align:center
I'm a fragile enough
slower as it is,

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.097 position:50% align:center
even when I'm not
under the weather!

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.557 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.975 position:50% align:center
And RIP, my throat.

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] Go home and
rest up if it hurts that bad.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:28.313 position:50% align:center
[HORI] You might be contagious,
you big dummy!

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
[SAWADA]
So heavy.

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
Um. Wait. Excuse me.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:02.263 position:50% align:center
So, uh, thank you.

00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
You might be contagious,
you big dummy!

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:09.479 position:50% align:center
Hey. You...

00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
Wait. What?

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:29.624 position:50% align:center
Man! A little bit of mouthwash

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:32.585 position:50% align:center
and a good night's rest got me
feelin' better than ever!

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
Congrats, dude.

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:35.171 position:50% align:center
Yeah, hurray.

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:36.756 position:50% align:center
Don't act so excited.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
And why congratulate me?

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:40.468 position:50% align:center
It isn't like that
cold was a big test.

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:41.678 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Speaking of,

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:42.887 position:50% align:center
your sister's studying
for entrance exams,

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:44.723 position:50% align:center
so I hope you
didn't get her sick.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.312 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sawada.

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:53.148 position:50% align:center
[shrieks]

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:55.150 position:50% align:center
Um. Hey.

00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:56.776 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Did you need Iura?

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.153 position:50% align:center
[SAWADA]
Mm-hmm.

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:01.239 position:50% align:center
[KONO] Do you think he's
angry with you or something?

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:03.074 position:50% align:center
Kinda.

00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:08.079 position:50% align:center
Does Iura... even get angry?

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:11.207 position:50% align:center
He's one of the most
laidback guys I've ever met.

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.877 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you positive
he's upset with you?

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
[IURA laughs]

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:17.589 position:50% align:center
Well, laughter is
typically a good sign.

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:20.091 position:50% align:center
So I believe
you're in the clear.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.428 position:50% align:center
[KONO]
Do you want him to like you?

00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:24.929 position:50% align:center
[SAWADA]
Hmm?

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50% align:center
Wha-ho!

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
What're you ladies doing
out here by your lonesomes?

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:36.691 position:50% align:center
If you're looking for Miyamura,

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:38.068 position:50% align:center
he hasn't made it in yet.

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:39.110 position:50% align:center
Hori has, though!

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:40.528 position:50% align:center
Were you two talking
about something?

00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:41.988 position:50% align:center
Was it private?

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:43.365 position:50% align:center
Know what? Don't answer that.

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.492 position:50% align:center
But I am curious if you
had to carry anything else.

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:47.035 position:50% align:center
The science room is practically

00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:48.495 position:50% align:center
on the other side of campus
from the second-year classrooms,

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:50.997 position:50% align:center
so I was worried you'd
wind up being tardy!

00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:52.248 position:50% align:center
Were you?

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:56.336 position:50% align:center
You're so stinking annoying!

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:59.005 position:50% align:center
Ahh. She totally hates me.

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:02.509 position:50% align:center
Iura? You should
work on your timing.

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:04.511 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
Wha...? What does that mean?

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:18.858 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER]
Hmm. Okay.

00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center
So you're setting your sights
on East High, are you?

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:23.113 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:26.700 position:50% align:center
That's quite a lofty goal.

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.743 position:50% align:center
And you've put all your
eggs in this one basket?

00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:30.245 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:31.996 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER] You should probably
be a little more realistic

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.499 position:50% align:center
and aim a rank lower.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:38.128 position:50% align:center
I mean, your grades
are pretty average.

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:41.715 position:50% align:center
You're not making marks in a
single subject that would be...

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:43.675 position:50% align:center
Oh. But that's not to say

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:46.344 position:50% align:center
you're completely
without options here.

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:47.554 position:50% align:center
Big dreams are nice.

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.014 position:50% align:center
But attainable ones are better,

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:51.683 position:50% align:center
so give it some thought
and come back to me.

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:53.935 position:50% align:center
East High isn't
the end-all be-all.

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
Yo, Moto-Moto.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.740 position:50% align:center
Know where Grampa is?

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.700 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
No.

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:12.662 position:50% align:center
'Kay. It can wait.

00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:16.291 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO] I'm not
gonna have dinner tonight.

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:17.500 position:50% align:center
Why's that?

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:23.673 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
My teacher laughed at me

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:26.593 position:50% align:center
when I told him where
I wanted to go to high school.

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:28.178 position:50% align:center
I don't understand
the correlation

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
between you not eating dinner
and this guy laughing at you.

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:33.558 position:50% align:center
Ugh! It's just that
I'm not hungry! Jeez!

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:35.352 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
Well, you're still going to eat.

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
Starving won't solve anything.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:42.650 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Fine. I'll force it down, okay?

00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:45.445 position:50% align:center
[IURA] Where do you
wanna go to high school?

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.030 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
You're gonna laugh, too.

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:48.907 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
Did I ask you to tell me a joke?

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.159 position:50% align:center
No, I asked about your future.

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:52.786 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Hmm...

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.497 position:50% align:center
East High.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.082 position:50% align:center
That's not funny!

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center
East High's the most basic name
for a school I've ever heard!

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.127 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO] My teacher didn't
laugh at the name, idiot!

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:03.088 position:50% align:center
He laughed because...

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:05.965 position:50% align:center
Well, my grades
aren't good enough.

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:07.842 position:50% align:center
So...

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:09.010 position:50% align:center
He did?

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:11.221 position:50% align:center
Do your grades
really suck that much?

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
Y'know, sis.

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:25.777 position:50% align:center
You've hurled enough textbooks

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center
and notes in my
face for me to have

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:29.072 position:50% align:center
a good idea of how you study.

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:30.824 position:50% align:center
Lemme tell ya.

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:32.659 position:50% align:center
The pages are barely
hanging on to their binding

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:35.412 position:50% align:center
because of the countless times
they've been turned.

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:36.579 position:50% align:center
And there are so many highlights

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:40.250 position:50% align:center
you could put the
nightly news to shame.

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.210 position:50% align:center
I see how hard you work.

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:43.920 position:50% align:center
Please tell me which
teacher had the nerve

00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:45.505 position:50% align:center
to laugh at all that effort.

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:47.549 position:50% align:center
I would love to be introduced.

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:50.051 position:50% align:center
So I can punch his lights out.

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
You're too smart to resort
to that, so I'll do it for you.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:59.728 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Why? I don't get it.

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:02.147 position:50% align:center
I really don't.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.442 position:50% align:center
I try, but my grades
keep slipping.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:09.404 position:50% align:center
Even my teacher thinks
I'm a lost cause.

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:11.364 position:50% align:center
He said big dreams are nice,

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:14.701 position:50% align:center
but attainable ones are better.

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:17.954 position:50% align:center
And all of my friends
have good enough grades.

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:19.456 position:50% align:center
I know they'll get in.

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
Then there's me.

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:26.379 position:50% align:center
Stupid me. I'm stuck!

00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:28.465 position:50% align:center
What should I do?

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:32.260 position:50% align:center
I feel so lost.

00:17:32.344 --> 00:17:35.889 position:50% align:center
No matter how much I try,
and try and try and try,

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
something in my brain
just doesn't click.

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:45.648 position:50% align:center
[IURA] The East High uniforms
are super ugly, anyway.

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:48.360 position:50% align:center
If you end up having to try
for a lower-ranked school,

00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:50.862 position:50% align:center
Katagiri should be
at the top of your list.

00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:54.616 position:50% align:center
Our uniforms look
awesome on everyone.

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:57.285 position:50% align:center
I know you'd rock one.

00:17:57.369 --> 00:18:01.414 position:50% align:center
The only thing you can
do now is your best.

00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:04.292 position:50% align:center
But you'll need brain food,
so make sure you eat.

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
[IURA]
I'm glad I caught you.

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:11.383 position:50% align:center
I have a little favor
to ask if you're free.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.305 position:50% align:center
Hey! You ready to study?

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:20.892 position:50% align:center
Iur-- Uh, your brother
already filled me in.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:21.935 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:24.187 position:50% align:center
Come on in, Motoko!

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:26.564 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Um.

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:28.858 position:50% align:center
Thanks for having me.

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:30.193 position:50% align:center
You can head upstairs

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:31.945 position:50% align:center
and set your stuff down
in my room if you want to.

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
It's the first door you see.

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:35.782 position:50% align:center
Meetcha there once
I get us drinks.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.659 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Sure. Sounds good.

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:41.955 position:50% align:center
Hello there.

00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:43.832 position:50% align:center
Hi! How are you doing?

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:49.796 position:50% align:center
Hello! Goodbye!

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.506 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:56.553 position:50% align:center
Those two were
probably her brothers.

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:58.221 position:50% align:center
You want me to
tutor your sister?

00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:01.182 position:50% align:center
Really? I'm honored
I was your first pick.

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
It doesn't even have to
last more than one session,

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:04.561 position:50% align:center
just until you can tell

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.354 position:50% align:center
if she'd be able
to test into East High.

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center
[HORI] That sounds
fairly doable, so sure.

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:10.066 position:50% align:center
And one last thing,

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
if it's completely
hopeless, tell her.

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:12.652 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Seriously?

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:14.696 position:50% align:center
Nah, I was just goofin'.

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:16.656 position:50% align:center
But if you could help prepare
her for the next test,

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.908 position:50% align:center
even a little bit,
that'd be great.

00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center
Not a problem.

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:24.873 position:50% align:center
[HORI] That's the face
of a big brother.

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:34.382 position:50% align:center
Sorry for the wait.

00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:36.092 position:50% align:center
Hope you like hot chocolate.

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
Uh, I do.

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:42.891 position:50% align:center
The resemblance between you
and your brother's uncanny.

00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:44.392 position:50% align:center
Do you get that a lot?

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:45.602 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:47.479 position:50% align:center
I can't really blame
people for saying that

00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:50.315 position:50% align:center
since my brother and I are
both the brooding, silent type.

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:51.483 position:50% align:center
Eh?!

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:55.904 position:50% align:center
Wow. The "silent type"?

00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:58.865 position:50% align:center
Uh, I brought textbooks
for each class.

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:00.533 position:50% align:center
I take a whole bunch of notes.

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:01.993 position:50% align:center
Would you like to go over them?

00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
Oh, we'll get to that later.

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:05.830 position:50% align:center
I know focusing
can be kinda tough

00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:07.874 position:50% align:center
when you're studying in
a place that's new to you.

00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:11.086 position:50% align:center
So let's have some girl talk.

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:12.837 position:50% align:center
Just put the books
down for a second.

00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
But... But that's
not why I'm here.

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.300 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Once you've relaxed a little

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:19.844 position:50% align:center
and made yourself more at home,
we can get to studying.

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:21.888 position:50% align:center
Doesn't necessarily
have to be girl talk.

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:23.515 position:50% align:center
I have some
resident boys on call

00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:26.017 position:50% align:center
that can come join us,
if you'd like.

00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
So, hey, who was
that girl in the hallway?

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:31.564 position:50% align:center
She's the younger sister
of our mutual friend.

00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:33.358 position:50% align:center
Hori's helping her study.

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:38.947 position:50% align:center
If you're ready for cupcakes,
lemme hear ya say yeah!

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.740 position:50% align:center
[SOTA]
Yeah!

00:20:40.824 --> 00:20:43.118 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMURA] Let's give some
to Motoko to show our support.

00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:44.619 position:50% align:center
[SOTA]
Okay!

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:46.329 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
You're kidding me!

00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:48.373 position:50% align:center
So it's the social norm
for middle schoolers

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:49.582 position:50% align:center
to have cell phones now?

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:52.210 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Everybody
in my grade has one.

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:53.712 position:50% align:center
[HORI]
Dang.

00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
Oh, but I don't have many of
my classmates' contact info,

00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:58.133 position:50% align:center
so I guess it's more
like a paperweight.

00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:00.468 position:50% align:center
I basically only
text my brother.

00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:02.095 position:50% align:center
Aw. So you're close?

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:03.805 position:50% align:center
We couldn't be further
apart if we tried!

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
Our typical conversation
consists of him

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:06.599 position:50% align:center
scolding me through
a text message

00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
when I come home late!

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:09.102 position:50% align:center
He could be in the next room,

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:11.563 position:50% align:center
but he'll use his phone
instead of his mouth!

00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:12.814 position:50% align:center
Sounds close to me.

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:15.358 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:19.904 position:50% align:center
Even after what I just told you,
you don't think he hates me?

00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:29.748 position:50% align:center
[ISHIKAWA] You look like you're
making a life-or-death decision.

00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:33.251 position:50% align:center
Which one is guaranteed
to make people pass exams?

00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:36.087 position:50% align:center
Stop being lame and
just pick a stupid charm!

00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:37.756 position:50% align:center
[IURA] Guess I'll go
with the biggest one.

00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:38.923 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:40.884 position:50% align:center
All of our charms
are the same size, sir.

00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:43.428 position:50% align:center
[IURA] Then which one's
the most expensive?

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:47.223 position:50% align:center
Is that for your sister?

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center
If she actually wants it, sure.

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:51.686 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't she want
a gift from her brother?

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:53.813 position:50% align:center
Especially one so thoughtful.

00:22:01.488 --> 00:22:03.823 position:50% align:center
Hey!
Look, it started snowing!

00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:10.622 position:50% align:center
Sometimes.

00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:12.123 position:50% align:center
It's hard.

00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:13.583 position:50% align:center
I know I mess up.

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:17.545 position:50% align:center
But even so...

00:22:17.629 --> 00:22:19.756 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
I hope she/he doesn't hate me.
