00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.875 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Whoa!

00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.292 align:middle
Just the other day,
he let me braid it, too.

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:22.792 align:middle
You are one
whipped boy, aren't ya?

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:24.750 align:middle
[STUDENT A]
Oh, wow!

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.583 align:middle
Your pigtails are
straight up cute!

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:28.000 align:middle
I love your hair like that!

00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:30.708 align:middle
Yeah, you should rock
that do every single day!

00:00:30.792 --> 00:00:33.250 align:middle
[STUDENT B] I'm guessing
Hori did it for you, right?

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.833 align:middle
It's adorable!

00:00:34.917 --> 00:00:37.792 align:middle
[STUDENT C] This look is totes
perfect for your bone structure.

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:40.292 align:middle
Oh. There goes the bell.

00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:41.833 align:middle
[STUDENT A]
See you tomorrow!

00:00:45.417 --> 00:00:46.458 align:middle
--Ow!
--[ISHIKAWA] Hey!

00:00:46.542 --> 00:00:48.042 align:middle
He can't help he's pretty!

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.250 align:middle
[HORI]
C'mon, dummy.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.667 align:middle
We're leaving.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.417 align:middle
Hold on, Hori.

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:38.458 align:middle
Hori.

00:02:38.542 --> 00:02:41.083 align:middle
Can I please have my bag?

00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.417 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Are you mad at me?

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.583 align:middle
'Cause of those girls?

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:47.875 align:middle
They got under
your skin that much?

00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.625 align:middle
I have every right to be mad!

00:02:49.708 --> 00:02:52.167 align:middle
They all treated you as
if you were invisible before!

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle
But the second you
cut your dumb hair,

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:55.708 align:middle
they can't keep their eyes
or their paws off you

00:02:55.792 --> 00:02:58.292 align:middle
and shamelessly flirt
right in front of me!

00:02:58.375 --> 00:02:59.958 align:middle
I'm not bothered in the least.

00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:01.500 align:middle
Are you sure?

00:03:05.083 --> 00:03:06.375 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
Miyamura?

00:03:07.917 --> 00:03:09.500 align:middle
It is you.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.667 align:middle
[TANIHARA] My point is,
that I think you should stop it.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.333 align:middle
He's depressing.

00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle
[STUDENT AA]
Whoa! Good eye, Tanihara.

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:20.667 align:middle
So Mister Doom
and Gloom turned prep?

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.625 align:middle
[TANIHARA laughs]
That does seem to be the case.

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:25.750 align:middle
So, you doing
all right these days?

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:27.042 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Yeah.

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:28.375 align:middle
[STUDENT AA] Damn,
you sure hit a growth spurt.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:30.500 align:middle
And, holy shit, your piercings.

00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:32.375 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] You don't look
so bad yourself, Tanihara.

00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:33.583 align:middle
Yeah, don't say my name.

00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:36.333 align:middle
Hearing it from your
mouth skeeves me out.

00:03:36.417 --> 00:03:38.917 align:middle
It took you till
high school to grow a pair?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.333 align:middle
Loser.

00:03:40.417 --> 00:03:42.000 align:middle
Ha-ho, what's this?

00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:44.667 align:middle
You have some stupid chick
carry your bag around?

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.417 align:middle
[STUDENT AA]
Aye, show some respect.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.792 align:middle
That "stupid chick"
might be his girlfriend.

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:50.667 align:middle
You really scored if she is.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.958 align:middle
Ten out of ten would bone.

00:03:53.042 --> 00:03:53.958 align:middle
[STUDENT AA]
What's wrong?

00:03:54.042 --> 00:03:55.583 align:middle
Cat got your tongue?

00:03:55.667 --> 00:03:57.542 align:middle
Are the two of you finished yet?

00:03:57.625 --> 00:03:59.250 align:middle
Op. She speaks.

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:00.917 align:middle
So you his girlfriend or not?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.333 align:middle
Do you know what he was
like back in middle school?

00:04:03.417 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle
Imagine the most emo
loner you've ever seen

00:04:05.583 --> 00:04:06.917 align:middle
in your entire life!

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.792 align:middle
Just pathetic!

00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:09.042 align:middle
Hey.

00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:11.750 align:middle
I asked you a question
you failed to answer.

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:13.625 align:middle
Are you finished?

00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:15.750 align:middle
[TANIHARA, STUDENT AA]
Huh?

00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:21.750 align:middle
If so, then you
assholes can piss off.

00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:25.500 align:middle
[punching, screaming]

00:04:26.208 --> 00:04:27.875 align:middle
Well, I was in a pretty
cruddy mood to begin with,

00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle
so that was bad
timing on their part.

00:04:30.083 --> 00:04:33.375 align:middle
I mean, they were treating
you like crap for no reason.

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:35.542 align:middle
How else was
I supposed to react?

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:36.417 align:middle
Right.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.708 align:middle
Seriously, though.

00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle
I can't believe how
nasty those idiots were.

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Yeah.

00:04:44.042 --> 00:04:46.042 align:middle
Great. Will that
be all for you today?

00:04:47.792 --> 00:04:49.125 align:middle
[SHINDO]
Dang, Tanihara.

00:04:49.208 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle
Did you take up
martial arts or something?

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:54.833 align:middle
[TANIHARA] Hmm...
I had a run-in with Miyamura.

00:04:54.917 --> 00:04:56.333 align:middle
[SHINDO]
Really?

00:04:56.417 --> 00:04:57.375 align:middle
Oof.

00:04:57.458 --> 00:04:58.917 align:middle
If he's the one
picking on you now,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.833 align:middle
I guess the shoe's
on the other foot.

00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.292 align:middle
It's whatever, man.

00:05:28.667 --> 00:05:30.125 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
He wasn't alone for once.

00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:32.208 align:middle
He had some girl with him.

00:05:32.292 --> 00:05:33.917 align:middle
I think they
might even be dating.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.042 align:middle
Any idea who I'm talking about?

00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:37.542 align:middle
Some girl, huh?

00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:39.375 align:middle
Oh. You must mean Hori.

00:05:39.458 --> 00:05:41.542 align:middle
He actually
landed himself a girl.

00:05:41.625 --> 00:05:43.583 align:middle
You know, you should
probably stop teasing him

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:45.625 align:middle
like you did
when we were younger.

00:05:45.708 --> 00:05:46.708 align:middle
Since he met Hori,

00:05:46.792 --> 00:05:48.167 align:middle
his defense stats
have been no joke.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.458 align:middle
Augh! She his girlfriend
or a summon from an RPG?

00:05:52.542 --> 00:05:55.917 align:middle
[SHINDO] He says it's whatever,
but it keeps bothering him.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.042 align:middle
The guy just can't
seem to get Miyamura

00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:00.250 align:middle
out of his head.

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:07.417 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Does it hurt?

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.125 align:middle
Huh? Does what hurt?

00:06:10.208 --> 00:06:11.833 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Never mind.

00:06:11.917 --> 00:06:14.083 align:middle
Just. Thank you.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.167 align:middle
Thank you?
Where is this coming from?

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.375 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:21.792 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I'm lucky enough to have someone

00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:24.208 align:middle
who gets mad on my behalf.

00:06:24.292 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle
She's right by my side.

00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle
[HORI]
I know! Use your open hand.

00:06:30.083 --> 00:06:31.792 align:middle
Make it the smallest slap ever!

00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:33.333 align:middle
No, Hori.

00:06:33.417 --> 00:06:34.708 align:middle
[HORI]
Why not?

00:06:34.792 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle
It wouldn't be the first time
you've done it, right?

00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:38.208 align:middle
Just pull back and bam!

00:06:38.292 --> 00:06:40.250 align:middle
I already told you no!

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:42.250 align:middle
Aww! I'm begging you!

00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:44.583 align:middle
One small slap?

00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] That is the
least "slapable" face ever.

00:06:47.083 --> 00:06:48.458 align:middle
She's all but down on her knees.

00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:49.833 align:middle
So why keep denying her?

00:06:49.917 --> 00:06:52.083 align:middle
Where the hell did
you come from, Shindo?

00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:53.542 align:middle
Over there, bro.

00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:56.542 align:middle
I was stalking you from afar,

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:58.708 align:middle
but you were treating Hori
in such a despicable manner

00:06:58.792 --> 00:07:00.333 align:middle
that I had to jump in.

00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:01.708 align:middle
Some man you are.

00:07:01.792 --> 00:07:03.375 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
You were stalking me?

00:07:03.458 --> 00:07:06.083 align:middle
It's none of your business,
Shindo, so just butt out.

00:07:06.167 --> 00:07:08.667 align:middle
I don't know what's going on
here, but I bet it's sexual.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.917 align:middle
Why's that the first
place your mind went to?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.292 align:middle
What's the big deal?

00:07:12.375 --> 00:07:13.667 align:middle
Does my happiness not matter

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.542 align:middle
'cause you fell out
of love with me?

00:07:15.625 --> 00:07:17.083 align:middle
No! Of course not!

00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:18.250 align:middle
Poor Hori.

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:19.583 align:middle
Your boyfriend's a poophead.

00:07:19.667 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle
Why are you still here?

00:07:21.083 --> 00:07:22.375 align:middle
If I can fulfill
your wish instead,

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:24.208 align:middle
then I'm at your service.

00:07:24.292 --> 00:07:25.958 align:middle
No task is too great.

00:07:26.042 --> 00:07:27.500 align:middle
Unless you don't want me.

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:28.750 align:middle
Nope.

00:07:28.833 --> 00:07:30.667 align:middle
It's totally pointless
if it's not Miyamura.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.542 align:middle
Which would mean that it
is something sexual!

00:07:32.625 --> 00:07:33.667 align:middle
How do you get
your brain to function

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.375 align:middle
without any cells in it?

00:07:35.458 --> 00:07:37.000 align:middle
I've had just about enough.

00:07:37.083 --> 00:07:39.083 align:middle
Come on. Let's go.

00:07:41.083 --> 00:07:41.875 align:middle
Hori?

00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.292 align:middle
You can be louder.

00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:46.083 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Why me?

00:07:46.167 --> 00:07:48.208 align:middle
Move your ass or I'll make you!

00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle
Not what it looks like!

00:07:50.333 --> 00:07:51.833 align:middle
So get your mind outta gutter!

00:07:51.917 --> 00:07:53.667 align:middle
[SHINDO]
Uh. Got it.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.917 align:middle
[HORI] Ooh! Can we stop by the
convenience store on the way?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.958 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Sure, you dumb ho!

00:07:58.042 --> 00:07:59.583 align:middle
What the actual hell?

00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:02.333 align:middle
[STUDENT BB]
Tanihara.

00:08:02.417 --> 00:08:04.250 align:middle
You've got extra cash,
so buy me a drink.

00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:05.458 align:middle
I'm thirsty.

00:08:05.542 --> 00:08:07.917 align:middle
Get your own
damn drink, you leech.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.958 align:middle
What's wrong, buddy?

00:08:09.042 --> 00:08:10.375 align:middle
That stick too far up your ass?

00:08:10.458 --> 00:08:11.833 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
Shut up.

00:08:11.917 --> 00:08:12.875 align:middle
[HORI]
Hey, goon squad.

00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.333 align:middle
Stop loitering
in the parking lot.

00:08:14.417 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle
Huh?

00:08:15.333 --> 00:08:16.583 align:middle
[TANIHARA, STUDENT AA gasp]

00:08:16.667 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle
Uh, we can do whatever
the hell we want to, bitch.

00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:22.042 align:middle
[TANIHARA] It's his
summon from the underworld!

00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:23.667 align:middle
If you wanna take that
crap attitude out back--

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.208 align:middle
Hey, don't talk to this girl
like that, you freakin' moron!

00:08:26.292 --> 00:08:28.042 align:middle
Damn! What you
yelling at me for?

00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:30.542 align:middle
It's all gravy! Just wanted to
clean up the trash around here.

00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:31.583 align:middle
[STUDENT AA]
Mm-hm! Mm-hm!

00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:32.958 align:middle
Keeping it green
for both you 'n' me!

00:08:33.042 --> 00:08:34.708 align:middle
[HORI]
Oh, you're recycling?

00:08:34.792 --> 00:08:36.000 align:middle
Good work, guys.

00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:38.333 align:middle
Phew! Damn.
That was close.

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:40.083 align:middle
If you had kept talking,
that demonic woman

00:08:40.167 --> 00:08:42.167 align:middle
would've bashed all
our skulls in, for sure!

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.667 align:middle
What? Really?

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.250 align:middle
She's that tough?

00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:46.917 align:middle
Hey look, it's Miyamura.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.125 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
I swear.

00:08:48.208 --> 00:08:49.917 align:middle
The next time I see
that guy alone, I'll--

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.375 align:middle
That guy's as much
of a monster as she is!

00:08:58.458 --> 00:08:59.417 align:middle
Holy shit.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.500 align:middle
So, um,

00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:02.583 align:middle
you guys wanna
talk about it, or nah?

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:06.708 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I'm not one to kinkshame,

00:09:06.792 --> 00:09:10.667 align:middle
but--this makes me wonder
if she's right in the head.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.667 align:middle
You've had your fun.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:12.750 align:middle
But listen...

00:09:12.833 --> 00:09:14.375 align:middle
[HORI]
Hmm?

00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:23.208 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Fine. You win.

00:09:27.042 --> 00:09:28.000 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I think it'd be best

00:09:28.083 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle
to just put all this
out of my mind.

00:09:31.667 --> 00:09:34.125 align:middle
[STUDENT BB] Miyamura sure
changed in the last few years.

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:35.792 align:middle
[STUDENT AA]
A high school transformation?

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:38.167 align:middle
[STUDENT BB laughs]
More like reincarnation!

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.417 align:middle
I mean, you remember how
he was back in middle school.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.667 align:middle
He barely talked to us.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.458 align:middle
Now he's going
around hitting girls?

00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:44.750 align:middle
Shit.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.542 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
I'm leaving.

00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:48.583 align:middle
You are?
It's still early, man.

00:09:49.833 --> 00:09:51.375 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
Dammit.

00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:53.458 align:middle
[HORI]
I'm home!

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:57.042 align:middle
'Kay! Catch ya later!

00:09:57.125 --> 00:09:58.000 align:middle
Bye?

00:09:58.083 --> 00:10:01.708 align:middle
Yo, be back by dinner, capiche?

00:10:01.792 --> 00:10:03.625 align:middle
And you're still
here because...?

00:10:03.708 --> 00:10:05.208 align:middle
[KYOSUKE] I thought it
went without saying,

00:10:05.292 --> 00:10:06.917 align:middle
but this is my house, too.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle
Hey, um, sir?

00:10:09.083 --> 00:10:11.375 align:middle
Would you mind if
I asked for some advice?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.292 align:middle
Nope! Sure don't!

00:10:14.375 --> 00:10:15.542 align:middle
Way too eager.

00:10:15.625 --> 00:10:16.417 align:middle
Very sus.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.708 align:middle
Shut it!

00:10:17.792 --> 00:10:20.042 align:middle
A man-to-man talk
has nothing to do with you!

00:10:23.417 --> 00:10:24.333 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
So, what's up?

00:10:24.417 --> 00:10:25.583 align:middle
You good?

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.500 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Why're we in the bathroom?

00:10:27.583 --> 00:10:29.875 align:middle
Um. I'm fine, thanks.

00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.625 align:middle
But I have a question
regarding Hori.

00:10:31.708 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle
Oh, no. Don't tell me
she's preggers yet again.

00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:35.500 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
What do you mean, "yet again?"

00:10:35.583 --> 00:10:37.458 align:middle
No, sir.
Nothing like that.

00:10:37.542 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle
She just really loves it
when I get mad

00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:41.500 align:middle
and yell at her,
and I have no clue why.

00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:42.625 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
What the...?

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:43.542 align:middle
That her kink or something?

00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:45.625 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
One would assume.

00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:46.833 align:middle
I wonder.

00:10:46.917 --> 00:10:48.167 align:middle
You don't normally yell.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.833 align:middle
It's like a bizarro you.

00:10:49.917 --> 00:10:51.917 align:middle
Bizarro?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.125 align:middle
Like if you cleaned up
and went to the office.

00:10:54.208 --> 00:10:55.708 align:middle
Your wife might be
into that change?

00:10:55.792 --> 00:10:56.833 align:middle
Ouch, man.

00:10:56.917 --> 00:10:58.125 align:middle
But yeah.

00:10:58.208 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle
It's kind of a
different flavor of you!

00:11:01.083 --> 00:11:02.792 align:middle
That makes sense.

00:11:04.833 --> 00:11:07.375 align:middle
I hate to break up whatever it
is you're doing in here,

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:09.250 align:middle
but I also wanna bathe
at a decent hour.

00:11:09.333 --> 00:11:10.333 align:middle
Sit down.

00:11:10.417 --> 00:11:11.792 align:middle
You should be a
part of this talk, too!

00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:13.083 align:middle
[HORI]
No thanks.

00:11:13.167 --> 00:11:14.000 align:middle
Kyoko!

00:11:14.083 --> 00:11:15.417 align:middle
Your boyfriend's
sad and worried,

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.542 align:middle
and you don't even care?

00:11:16.625 --> 00:11:18.417 align:middle
[HORI]
You are such a pain.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.792 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
Wanna know what's a pain?

00:11:19.875 --> 00:11:22.500 align:middle
Trying to live up to
your irrational expectations!

00:11:22.583 --> 00:11:24.458 align:middle
Huh?! Hold the phone!

00:11:24.542 --> 00:11:26.792 align:middle
You are the last person
I wanna hear a lecture from!

00:11:26.875 --> 00:11:28.250 align:middle
Maybe you could
try doing some chores

00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:30.833 align:middle
before you nag on people
for being inconsiderate.

00:11:30.917 --> 00:11:32.042 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Shots fired.

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
Right in my feelings.

00:11:34.083 --> 00:11:36.750 align:middle
The curry I made the other day
should count for something!

00:11:36.833 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle
[HORI]
Know what it counts for?

00:11:38.083 --> 00:11:39.208 align:middle
The amount of time it
took to microwave it!

00:11:39.292 --> 00:11:40.583 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
But you said it was yummy!

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:41.708 align:middle
[HORI]
Well, yeah, of course!

00:11:41.792 --> 00:11:43.125 align:middle
Prepackaged stuff
is always good!

00:11:43.208 --> 00:11:45.417 align:middle
[KYOSUKE] Ooh! And Sota
got seconds, remember?

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.625 align:middle
Why's this water
the perfect temperature?

00:11:47.708 --> 00:11:49.500 align:middle
[KYOSUKE]
Ah! You're sopping wet!

00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:50.750 align:middle
Better nix those clothes!

00:11:50.833 --> 00:11:51.792 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Wait! Please, sir!

00:11:51.875 --> 00:11:54.083 align:middle
[HORI]
Stop unzipping my boyfriend!

00:11:55.875 --> 00:11:56.958 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Give you three guesses

00:11:57.042 --> 00:11:59.292 align:middle
what Shu and I did
for fun the other day.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.958 align:middle
No way!

00:12:01.042 --> 00:12:03.375 align:middle
Those pop songs
are too hard, dude!

00:12:03.458 --> 00:12:04.917 align:middle
It got old fast.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle
If it ain't traidional or rap,
he won't sing.

00:12:07.083 --> 00:12:09.208 align:middle
Yeah, but he
listens to everything.

00:12:09.292 --> 00:12:12.833 align:middle
Which is why he could have
busted out Western stuff, too.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.792 align:middle
Yo. Mizouchi.

00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:19.333 align:middle
You... wanna be a
jerk and ignore me?

00:12:19.417 --> 00:12:20.208 align:middle
Sorry.

00:12:20.292 --> 00:12:22.292 align:middle
But it's 'cause I'm here.

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:26.125 align:middle
Apparently, he has a
little crush on Hori, so...

00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:27.250 align:middle
Oh, wow.

00:12:27.333 --> 00:12:29.417 align:middle
Does everyone at
this school like her?

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.083 align:middle
[MIYAMURA, ISHIKAWA] But my eyes
have been opened to the truth.

00:12:32.167 --> 00:12:35.083 align:middle
One does not simply fall
in love with Kyoko Hori.

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:36.542 align:middle
Hey, where is she?

00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle
I think the
student council room.

00:12:39.375 --> 00:12:40.458 align:middle
My phone's missing.

00:12:40.542 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle
Did you leave it
in the science lab?

00:12:42.333 --> 00:12:44.375 align:middle
One way to find out.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.708 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I, uh, think I left my phone.

00:12:53.792 --> 00:12:55.792 align:middle
Have you seen it
lying around anywhere?

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:57.125 align:middle
[MIZOUCHI]
No.

00:12:57.208 --> 00:12:58.667 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Okay.

00:13:01.833 --> 00:13:04.167 align:middle
[MIZOUCHI] Why would your
phone be with the supplies?

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.583 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Well...

00:13:05.667 --> 00:13:08.125 align:middle
Nobody else has had class
in this room since we did.

00:13:08.208 --> 00:13:10.375 align:middle
So it's gotta be
around here somewhere.

00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:13.083 align:middle
Unless it sprouted
legs and walked away.

00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:17.708 align:middle
[sighs]

00:13:17.792 --> 00:13:19.208 align:middle
What's your number?

00:13:19.292 --> 00:13:20.375 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Huh?

00:13:20.458 --> 00:13:21.667 align:middle
--[MIZOUCHI] I'll call it.
--Uh, really?

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.625 align:middle
Uh, yeah, okay, it's zero,
nine, zero, then...

00:13:26.792 --> 00:13:32.375 align:middle
[phone buzzes]

00:13:32.458 --> 00:13:34.458 align:middle
Found it.

00:13:34.542 --> 00:13:35.917 align:middle
Uh... Uh?!

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.208 align:middle
What?! You had it in your
back pocket the entire time?

00:13:38.292 --> 00:13:39.250 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Thanks for the help.

00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:41.833 align:middle
You saved the day. Huh? Hang on.

00:13:41.917 --> 00:13:43.000 align:middle
Why's the screen all black?

00:13:43.083 --> 00:13:43.917 align:middle
[MIZOUCHI]
Then you go and break it

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.792 align:middle
less than three seconds later?

00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:47.958 align:middle
Why did she choose
a dimwit like you?

00:13:48.042 --> 00:13:49.542 align:middle
I...

00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:51.000 align:middle
I take that back.

00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.292 align:middle
Question for you.

00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:58.958 align:middle
If you had no choice, do you
think you could punch Hori?

00:13:59.042 --> 00:13:59.792 align:middle
Punch her?

00:13:59.875 --> 00:14:01.792 align:middle
Like, if we were fighting?

00:14:01.875 --> 00:14:02.917 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Uh... Yeah.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.125 align:middle
Let's go with that.

00:14:05.208 --> 00:14:06.583 align:middle
[MIZOUCHI]
Um. No.

00:14:06.667 --> 00:14:08.417 align:middle
I'd never raise a hand to her.

00:14:10.042 --> 00:14:12.167 align:middle
I see.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.792 align:middle
If that's the case,

00:14:13.875 --> 00:14:16.458 align:middle
you and her wouldn't
have worked out anyway.

00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:20.125 align:middle
Hey! There you are!

00:14:20.208 --> 00:14:21.125 align:middle
Find your phone?

00:14:21.208 --> 00:14:22.625 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Oh. Yeah.

00:14:22.708 --> 00:14:24.208 align:middle
You really do
leave it everywhere.

00:14:24.292 --> 00:14:25.417 align:middle
You would probably
lose your head, too,

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.458 align:middle
if it wasn't attached, huh?

00:14:27.542 --> 00:14:30.292 align:middle
Well, maybe make a mental note
to check next time if--

00:14:30.375 --> 00:14:32.458 align:middle
You can make a mental note
to check your mouth!

00:14:32.542 --> 00:14:34.167 align:middle
Does that sound like a plan?

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.708 align:middle
[gasps]

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:38.083 align:middle
Now move.

00:14:38.167 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle
Mizouchi. Leave her be.

00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:44.125 align:middle
Huh? Um, 'kay.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.208 align:middle
[MIZOUCHI]
Listen. You know.

00:14:52.292 --> 00:14:53.417 align:middle
You're so quiet and scrawny

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.417 align:middle
that I didn't think
you were the kinda guy

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle
that could stand up for himself.

00:14:56.083 --> 00:14:58.125 align:middle
The term "loser" comes to mind.

00:14:58.208 --> 00:15:00.000 align:middle
But now that you're
together with Hori.

00:15:00.083 --> 00:15:01.917 align:middle
I see how confident you are.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.292 align:middle
Yep. Sure am.

00:15:03.375 --> 00:15:05.833 align:middle
[MIZOUCHI] Dude! Why are
your eyes all red and puffy?

00:15:05.917 --> 00:15:07.708 align:middle
Were you rubbing them
or something?

00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:14.500 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
Miyamura?

00:15:14.583 --> 00:15:15.375 align:middle
Get out.

00:15:15.458 --> 00:15:16.833 align:middle
There's not enough room!

00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:18.208 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
And where should I go?

00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:19.458 align:middle
Outside of here!

00:15:19.542 --> 00:15:21.333 align:middle
Speaking of,
where the heck are we?

00:15:21.417 --> 00:15:22.833 align:middle
We are outside.

00:15:22.917 --> 00:15:23.833 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
What?

00:15:23.917 --> 00:15:25.708 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
This place is outside.

00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:27.417 align:middle
The only free space there is.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.333 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
I'm not dumb!

00:15:28.417 --> 00:15:29.625 align:middle
I know what a locker looks like,

00:15:29.708 --> 00:15:31.750 align:middle
and the only things
missing are the textbooks!

00:15:31.833 --> 00:15:33.875 align:middle
But this is what
it's like "outside."

00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.042 align:middle
This is how it feels.

00:15:36.125 --> 00:15:37.292 align:middle
You've always been
on the "inside,"

00:15:37.375 --> 00:15:39.792 align:middle
so it's a feeling
that's unfamiliar to you.

00:15:39.875 --> 00:15:41.000 align:middle
Who gives a damn?

00:15:41.083 --> 00:15:43.167 align:middle
All this inside-outside
nonsense is stupid.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.833 align:middle
You realize you're the one
who brought it up, right?

00:15:45.917 --> 00:15:48.333 align:middle
I'm just answering
the questions you have.

00:15:48.417 --> 00:15:51.000 align:middle
We've never really
talked like this before.

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:53.042 align:middle
Do tight spaces make you uneasy?

00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:54.333 align:middle
Yeah, I hate them.

00:15:54.417 --> 00:15:57.375 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Hm. That makes two of us.

00:15:57.458 --> 00:15:59.125 align:middle
You enjoy being on the inside?

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:01.708 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
I mean, it's better than this.

00:16:01.792 --> 00:16:04.833 align:middle
Even if there's no
one to enjoy it with?

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.500 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] If everybody on
the inside decided they wanted

00:16:08.583 --> 00:16:12.667 align:middle
to try things outside,
you'd be left alone in there.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:13.875 align:middle
Well.

00:16:16.083 --> 00:16:17.875 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] You don't care
if you're in or out.

00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.000 align:middle
What you're focused on

00:16:19.083 --> 00:16:20.792 align:middle
is whether or not
people are with you.

00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:23.667 align:middle
That makes or breaks
your preference.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.333 align:middle
The people on your side
are what matter to you.

00:16:26.417 --> 00:16:27.792 align:middle
Simple as that.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.583 align:middle
I just... Um...

00:16:42.125 --> 00:16:43.708 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:48.917 --> 00:16:49.917 align:middle
Huh?

00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:55.583 align:middle
[SHINDO]
Huh? Miyamura's number?

00:16:55.667 --> 00:16:57.583 align:middle
What?
What do you want it for?

00:16:57.667 --> 00:16:58.458 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
None of your business.

00:16:58.542 --> 00:16:59.958 align:middle
Just tell me.

00:17:00.042 --> 00:17:01.958 align:middle
[SHINDO]
Fine, I'll text it to you.

00:17:02.042 --> 00:17:04.333 align:middle
The rabbits liked Miyamura
better than anyone.

00:17:04.417 --> 00:17:06.375 align:middle
Everybody 'n'
their grandma knew.

00:17:06.458 --> 00:17:07.458 align:middle
Back then.

00:17:07.542 --> 00:17:08.583 align:middle
[SHINDO]
What the...

00:17:08.667 --> 00:17:09.833 align:middle
Where'd this
rabbit tangent come from?

00:17:09.917 --> 00:17:11.167 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
More importantly,

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.417 align:middle
how long does it take
to text a friggin' number?

00:17:13.875 --> 00:17:21.042 align:middle
[phone ringing]

00:17:24.167 --> 00:17:27.167 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
Tsch! He's ignoring me.

00:17:29.417 --> 00:17:30.792 align:middle
[IORI]
Izumi!

00:17:30.875 --> 00:17:33.542 align:middle
Since you're near the door,
can you bring the sign in?

00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:34.958 align:middle
On it.

00:17:40.458 --> 00:17:42.167 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
You guys closed already?

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.708 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Sorry.

00:17:43.792 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle
We're closed tomorrow, too,
but we'll be open the day after.

00:17:59.208 --> 00:18:00.542 align:middle
You may be in luck.

00:18:00.625 --> 00:18:03.042 align:middle
There's another shop
a little further.

00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:05.500 align:middle
It's a much bigger bakery,
and still open.

00:18:05.583 --> 00:18:06.833 align:middle
If you turn that corner there--

00:18:06.917 --> 00:18:08.333 align:middle
[TANIHARA] I want something
from this cake shop.

00:18:08.417 --> 00:18:10.792 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Oh. Are you sure?

00:18:10.875 --> 00:18:12.167 align:middle
But... it's okay.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.500 align:middle
I'll stop by again
the day after tomorrow.

00:18:14.583 --> 00:18:16.708 align:middle
I hear your cheesecake's good?

00:18:16.792 --> 00:18:18.000 align:middle
It's very good.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.417 align:middle
Cool. See ya in two days.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.417 align:middle
Enjoy the break.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.708 align:middle
And! Our fruit
tarts are awesome!

00:18:27.042 --> 00:18:30.125 align:middle
Try those, too.
If you want.

00:18:30.208 --> 00:18:32.625 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
All right. I'm sold.

00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:37.417 align:middle
I'll get two of each.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.500 align:middle
Got it. I'll save 'em for ya.

00:18:48.417 --> 00:18:50.292 align:middle
Later. But not too much.

00:18:50.375 --> 00:18:51.167 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Mm-hm.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.042 align:middle
I tried to call.

00:18:53.125 --> 00:18:54.833 align:middle
My cell?

00:18:54.917 --> 00:18:56.708 align:middle
I broke it the other day.

00:18:56.792 --> 00:19:00.375 align:middle
I'm gonna try and
get it fixed tomorrow.

00:19:00.458 --> 00:19:03.500 align:middle
Oh... Okay.

00:19:03.917 --> 00:19:07.792 align:middle
[TANIHARA] So I guess he
wasn't purposely ignoring me.

00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:09.917 align:middle
It's been the other way around.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle
I was ignoring him.

00:19:12.083 --> 00:19:14.333 align:middle
All this time.

00:19:15.458 --> 00:19:16.875 align:middle
Did it stress you out?

00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.042 align:middle
What?

00:19:18.125 --> 00:19:19.542 align:middle
Um... I...

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:20.750 align:middle
Never mind.

00:19:20.833 --> 00:19:22.333 align:middle
Bye. For real.

00:19:22.417 --> 00:19:23.208 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Tanihara?

00:19:23.292 --> 00:19:25.000 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
Hmm?

00:19:25.083 --> 00:19:26.458 align:middle
Sorry we're closed.

00:19:26.542 --> 00:19:28.250 align:middle
But thanks for coming.

00:19:43.042 --> 00:19:45.458 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
I forgot to feed the rabbits.

00:19:45.542 --> 00:19:47.125 align:middle
I know I was supposed to,

00:19:47.208 --> 00:19:49.250 align:middle
but by summer's end,
they were all dead.

00:19:49.333 --> 00:19:50.500 align:middle
They starved.

00:19:50.583 --> 00:19:52.833 align:middle
After, I blamed
the entire thing on you.

00:19:52.917 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle
I blamed you but--

00:19:54.583 --> 00:19:56.292 align:middle
It's my fault!

00:19:58.833 --> 00:20:00.875 align:middle
Okay.

00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:01.917 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
Miyamura.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.625 align:middle
I've been wanting to tell you.

00:20:03.708 --> 00:20:07.583 align:middle
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:20:12.208 --> 00:20:14.250 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
I wonder.

00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:18.792 align:middle
How would things have turned out
if I'd apologized back then.

00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:21.333 align:middle
It hurts my heart
to think about it.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.958 align:middle
Okay. That was the last one.

00:20:25.042 --> 00:20:28.333 align:middle
Thanks a million
for helping me.

00:20:28.417 --> 00:20:29.958 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Hmm?

00:20:30.042 --> 00:20:32.208 align:middle
Are these your old yearbooks?

00:20:32.292 --> 00:20:33.083 align:middle
Yeah.

00:20:33.167 --> 00:20:34.292 align:middle
That one's from middle school.

00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:35.792 align:middle
Good times.

00:20:35.875 --> 00:20:38.542 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] What did she
look like in those days?

00:20:38.625 --> 00:20:41.625 align:middle
Peek and you die where you sit.

00:20:41.708 --> 00:20:43.833 align:middle
Yearbooks are kinda
annoying, aren't they?

00:20:43.917 --> 00:20:46.458 align:middle
They're bulky and take up
lots of space on your shelves.

00:20:46.542 --> 00:20:49.125 align:middle
But throwing them away
feels wrong for some reason.

00:20:49.208 --> 00:20:50.250 align:middle
Did you toss yours?

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:52.125 align:middle
Or do you still have 'em?

00:20:55.833 --> 00:20:57.708 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I wanted to trash them.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.375 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] But then
I felt how heavy they were,

00:21:02.458 --> 00:21:05.292 align:middle
and I had that dilemma
you just mentioned.

00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:08.750 align:middle
So I wound up keeping them.

00:21:08.833 --> 00:21:10.208 align:middle
And I'm glad I did.

00:21:10.292 --> 00:21:11.875 align:middle
'Cause my past
experiences shaped me

00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle
into the person I am now.

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:15.958 align:middle
[HORI] I'm sure Miyamura
must have wanted to throw

00:21:16.042 --> 00:21:19.250 align:middle
a lot more than
his yearbooks away.

00:21:19.333 --> 00:21:20.417 align:middle
I don't know the details

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.292 align:middle
of what he went through
in middle school.

00:21:23.375 --> 00:21:25.000 align:middle
From what I've gathered, though.

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:27.625 align:middle
I suspect he might've
hated everything.

00:21:27.708 --> 00:21:30.333 align:middle
Aimlessly drifting along
with no purpose.

00:21:30.417 --> 00:21:31.792 align:middle
But now it's different.

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:33.958 align:middle
Now he can look back
and be happy

00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:35.708 align:middle
that he didn't
throw everything away.

00:21:35.792 --> 00:21:37.375 align:middle
Welp.
All this talk of yearbooks

00:21:37.458 --> 00:21:39.542 align:middle
makes me wonder how our
senior one's gonna turn out.

00:21:39.625 --> 00:21:42.250 align:middle
Yeah. But no way of
knowing until we get it.

00:21:42.333 --> 00:21:45.042 align:middle
They took the pictures in April,
but it seems like forever ago.

00:21:45.125 --> 00:21:46.750 align:middle
I guess it kinda does.

00:21:46.833 --> 00:21:49.000 align:middle
I hope they get a
shot of me with Mizouchi.

00:21:49.083 --> 00:21:49.917 align:middle
What?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.292 align:middle
You're joking, right?

00:21:51.375 --> 00:21:53.708 align:middle
No. We recently bonded,
believe it or not.

00:21:53.792 --> 00:21:55.125 align:middle
Wow.

00:21:55.208 --> 00:21:57.125 align:middle
The one good thing to come
from losing my cell phone.

00:21:57.208 --> 00:22:00.417 align:middle
He was mean to me before,
but we're on better terms.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.167 align:middle
Least I think so.

00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:04.958 align:middle
[HORI]
Is that his kink?

00:22:05.042 --> 00:22:06.917 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] What's even crazier
is that things are starting

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.500 align:middle
to look promising
with Tanihara, too.

00:22:09.583 --> 00:22:12.083 align:middle
[HORI]
That is crazy.

00:22:12.167 --> 00:22:16.125 align:middle
Even if it's difficult
first starting out,
