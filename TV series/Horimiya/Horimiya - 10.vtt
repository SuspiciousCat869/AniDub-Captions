00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:16.933 align:middle
Ugh, I'm freezing!

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.394 align:middle
Def adding a scarf to
my ensemble tomorrow.

00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:22.313 align:middle
Evenings have been pretty
nippy lately, haven't they?

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle
Um. Hey.

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:32.741 align:middle
Huh?

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:34.909 align:middle
Hey, yourself.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.373 align:middle
Listen, you!

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.375 align:middle
If you think I'm gonna let you
steal my boyfriend, think again!

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.377 align:middle
I just said, "Hey," and
now I'm a boyfriend thief?

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:45.503 align:middle
You do much weirder
stuff than say,

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:46.671 align:middle
"Hey," 'n' you know it!

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.590 align:middle
I've seen how
touchy-feely you two get!

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:50.425 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
Oh. Sorry 'bout that.

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:52.177 align:middle
I mean, we are closer.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.179 align:middle
Way more than we used
to be, but that's it!

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:55.472 align:middle
All we are is friends.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.682 align:middle
[HORI] I started out
as Miyamura's "friend,"

00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.059 align:middle
too, you know.

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:01.811 align:middle
So exactly how "close"
do you intend to get to him?

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.188 align:middle
You're that threatened by me?

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:04.606 align:middle
Shindo's ten times worse.

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:05.982 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Dude!

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.151 align:middle
[HORI]
I didn't realize.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.278 align:middle
Do you love Shindo more than me?

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:12.155 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Absolutely not!

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:13.365 align:middle
Then what did you mean?

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.033 align:middle
What makes Shindo
such a threat to me?

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:18.703 align:middle
Well, "threat" might be
too strong of a word,

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:20.455 align:middle
but I have seen him go
over to Miyamura's place

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:22.749 align:middle
to pick up a change
of clothes in the past.

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.086 align:middle
Look, he invites himself, okay?

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:27.796 align:middle
Not my fault.

00:01:32.717 --> 00:01:34.803 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
A wild Shindo appears!

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:37.138 align:middle
[SHINDO] You guys having a
block party over here, or what?

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:39.099 align:middle
Mind if I join? Looks like fun!

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:41.518 align:middle
Random question.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.478 align:middle
But are you and
Chika fairly close?

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:47.023 align:middle
Eh. Studying for exams has
been eating up all her time,

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.317 align:middle
so not lately, no.

00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:51.945 align:middle
I've spent plenty of sleepless
nights at Miyamura's, though,

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:54.739 align:middle
so don't feel
too bad for me, heh!

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:55.740 align:middle
Hmm?

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:56.783 align:middle
You hungry?

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:58.451 align:middle
Let's grab a burger!

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:00.704 align:middle
Yeah! You're always trying
to have a cow anyway,

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.247 align:middle
so why not eat one instead?

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.707 align:middle
[SHINDO]
I'm so lost right now.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.834 align:middle
But a burger actually
does sound good.

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.711 align:middle
Ooh! Did that coupon expire yet?

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.379 align:middle
[TANIHARA]
Uh, yeah, it did.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:11.798 align:middle
Miyamura?

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:13.925 align:middle
Let's make something clear.

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:16.845 align:middle
Okay? Girls are
the least of my concern.

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:18.763 align:middle
Guys on the other hand.

00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:20.849 align:middle
I see them taking you so easily.

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:22.183 align:middle
And I just can't...

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:23.309 align:middle
[sobs]

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:25.145 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
You see them taking me how?

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:26.521 align:middle
[HORI]
Promise me one thing!

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:29.315 align:middle
If you fall for someone else,
it better be a girl!

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.985 align:middle
Can you do that for me?

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:34.738 align:middle
Sure! Consider it done!

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.073 align:middle
So you all need to
stay out of my bubble.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.116 align:middle
From now on,

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.285 align:middle
I need you to
keep your distance!

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:42.287 align:middle
What about when you gotta go?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.747 align:middle
Like, to the toilet?

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.457 align:middle
I won't go in public!

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.583 align:middle
I'll hold it!

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:47.959 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
The things you do for love.

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:49.044 align:middle
Have fun with that.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:22.595 align:middle
You could've just gotten
your art supplies by yourself!

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:23.972 align:middle
Shopping for stuff
I don't even need

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:26.099 align:middle
is not how I wanted
to spend my day off!

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:27.392 align:middle
[MIKI]
I want to hit up the bookstore

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:28.643 align:middle
while we're here and
I wouldn't have been able

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:30.895 align:middle
to carry everything
if you hadn't come.

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.689 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA] Going to
the bookstore another day

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:34.524 align:middle
was an option, too.

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:37.777 align:middle
[YANAGI]
No way! Yoshikawa?

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.320 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Yanagi!

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.448 align:middle
Oh! You have your glasses!

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.575 align:middle
I thought I recognized you!

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:44.951 align:middle
Having a shopping spree?

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:47.037 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Kinda. Not a "spree."

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.788 align:middle
Just art supplies and books.

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle
[YANAGI]
Ah! So you're an artist?

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:51.875 align:middle
I had no idea.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle
Oh no, none of
this stuff is for me.

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:55.962 align:middle
It's my sister's.

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:58.506 align:middle
[MIKI]
Stare.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.216 align:middle
Speaking of, here she is.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.468 align:middle
Akane Yanagi.

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.261 align:middle
Pleased to make
your acquiescence.

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:04.846 align:middle
Good grief.

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:07.932 align:middle
Didn't think Yuki was capable
of making friends as hot as you.

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:10.143 align:middle
You dating and
keeping it on the DL?

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:13.188 align:middle
Wish I could say we were,
but she turned me down.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:16.358 align:middle
Yeah, figures, someone
like you wouldn't even--

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:18.818 align:middle
No! Back up!
She turned you down?!

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.570 align:middle
You don't hafta
keep talking, y'know!

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:23.323 align:middle
[MIKI]
That can't be accurate, can it?

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:24.949 align:middle
I assure you it is.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.409 align:middle
She's way outta my league.

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:27.744 align:middle
[MIKI]
My sister?

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:30.663 align:middle
We're still talking about
the same person, right?

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:31.915 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA] I know exactly
what you're thinking,

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.876 align:middle
so you can stop looking
at me like that, okay?

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.588 align:middle
Please excuse her
for the time being.

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:39.714 align:middle
Totally fine.

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:41.841 align:middle
I'm just happy I ran into you.

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:43.093 align:middle
Talking with
you outside of school

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:45.887 align:middle
is kinda like a dream come true.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.847 align:middle
Oh! I shouldn't have said that.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:51.142 align:middle
Ishikawa would get
upset if he knew.

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.352 align:middle
You're sweet,

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.646 align:middle
which is why I don't
think he'd mind at all.

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:05.699 align:middle
I know for a fact
Toru wouldn't be upset.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:07.325 align:middle
But I keep on lying.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:11.329 align:middle
Guess what!

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:12.789 align:middle
I heard they're dating now!

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:14.958 align:middle
Aww! It makes sense, though!

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:15.834 align:middle
Think about it.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:17.377 align:middle
They're constantly together.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.461 align:middle
[STUDENT A]
Oh, for sure!

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:26.428 align:middle
[STUDENT A]
They make such a good couple.

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:37.689 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA] I know that we've
got Kono completely fooled.

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.899 align:middle
Fooled how?

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:42.736 align:middle
She thinks
I'm dating Toru, right?

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:46.573 align:middle
She actually fell
for our charade.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:47.866 align:middle
I have no clue.

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.076 align:middle
She hasn't mentioned it to me.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.161 align:middle
She did.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.830 align:middle
'Cause she asked
about it yesterday.

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.498 align:middle
And I didn't deny it.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.459 align:middle
I said the rumors were true.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.419 align:middle
Why did I say that, though?

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:01.087 align:middle
What part of me
thought it would be okay

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:02.630 align:middle
to lie to her face?

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:03.882 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
And you're telling me this

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.592 align:middle
because you're hoping
I'll explain to Sakura

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:07.802 align:middle
what's really going on?

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.179 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Mm-hmm.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.348 align:middle
Remi doesn't have
to explain, you know.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:14.976 align:middle
If you really do have a crush
on him, I'll stay quiet.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.853 align:middle
That's not fair.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:19.230 align:middle
I'm failing to see how.

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:23.151 align:middle
What's unfair

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.986 align:middle
is you, Yuki.

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:28.573 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
She's right.

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:33.036 align:middle
I'm not being
considerate of Kono at all.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:35.955 align:middle
I was well aware
lying would hurt her,

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.583 align:middle
but I did it anyway.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:41.920 align:middle
I'm terrible.

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:44.339 align:middle
--[running footsteps]
--[gasps]

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.303 align:middle
As she was running away.

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:52.639 align:middle
I saw her lips
trembling so fast.

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:55.725 align:middle
I didn't know
they could do that.

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.060 align:middle
All right then,

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.646 align:middle
tt's about time
I started telling the truth,

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:00.980 align:middle
so here it is.

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:05.360 align:middle
Huh?

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:08.279 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
I see.

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:10.532 align:middle
Thanks for being honest, Yuki.

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.831 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
I know this won't last forever.

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:20.625 align:middle
I knew it from
the very beginning.

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:23.753 align:middle
Toru would have to have
romantic feelings for me,

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:25.880 align:middle
and he doesn't.

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:27.882 align:middle
The first day we
pretended to be dating

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:30.343 align:middle
should've also been the last.

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:34.681 align:middle
But he still holds my hand.

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:41.146 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA] He's so nice to me
even when I don't deserve it.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:44.983 align:middle
We might have to keep this up
just in case he catches on.

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.443 align:middle
Are you okay with that?

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:50.030 align:middle
Huh? Hmm...

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:51.239 align:middle
Yeah, sure.

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.074 align:middle
It's fine.

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:54.576 align:middle
Oh.

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:59.873 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA] Being found out
didn't really bother me.

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:01.708 align:middle
I think what
I wanted was for our lie

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.252 align:middle
to become something real.

00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:10.216 align:middle
But even if it did,
it would always be tainted.

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:15.388 align:middle
[sighs]

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.766 align:middle
Yuki was absent yet again.

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:19.851 align:middle
Jeez. How many days is that?

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:21.061 align:middle
Three, I think?

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:22.312 align:middle
Or four?

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.689 align:middle
However long it's been,
I don't like it one bit.

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:26.608 align:middle
I wonder if maybe she's sick.

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:29.986 align:middle
Being sick wouldn't stop her
from returning my texts though.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.697 align:middle
Have you heard from her?

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:34.157 align:middle
--Toru?
--[ISHIKAWA] Hm?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.617 align:middle
Oh. Sorry. What's up?

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle
Come back to Earth, please.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.703 align:middle
Yuki's more important
than your phone.

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:41.915 align:middle
But since you have it out,
can you see if she texted you?

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:43.124 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Already checked.

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:45.043 align:middle
She's not talking to me either.

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:47.337 align:middle
Maybe it's family
drama or something.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.589 align:middle
[HORI]
Who knows?

00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:52.092 align:middle
Ooh! We should probably tell
her that test is gonna cover

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:54.094 align:middle
a whole bunch of
different stuff now.

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:55.929 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Ah! Good idea.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.430 align:middle
Try and tell her in person,

00:09:57.514 --> 00:09:59.224 align:middle
so you can watch
the tantrum she throws.

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:02.060 align:middle
Hey! She's more
mature than that.

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle
Sure hope she comes tomorrow.

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.563 align:middle
Yeah. Heh.

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:08.191 align:middle
Come on!

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.234 align:middle
I don't know what's wrong,

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:11.069 align:middle
but you need
to go back to school.

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:13.822 align:middle
Does your attendance record
not matter to you?

00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:18.618 align:middle
Do not ignore me
when I'm talking!

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:19.911 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Ouch!

00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:24.416 align:middle
Some girl named Hori called,
asking about you.

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:27.794 align:middle
Said she used the home phone
'cause your cell's off.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:29.129 align:middle
I'm gonna go out on a limb here

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:31.798 align:middle
and guess there's
something you want.

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:33.591 align:middle
You have a rotten history
of never admitting

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:36.052 align:middle
when your heart
is set on something.

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:38.972 align:middle
And why you do
this is beyond me.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.182 align:middle
[MIKI]
Listen, Yuki.

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:42.517 align:middle
It's okay to want things.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.977 align:middle
You shouldn't feel embarrassed.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.895 align:middle
What's not okay is
wallowing in self-pity

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle
because you keep letting
the things you want pass you by.

00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:51.317 align:middle
Don't let it go

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:53.028 align:middle
if you're just gonna complain
about it afterward.

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:54.779 align:middle
Why can't I have a
pretty new hair clip

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:56.406 align:middle
that's like the kind she has?

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:57.824 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA'S MOTHER] Because
when I asked you in the store,

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.285 align:middle
you told me you were
fine without one.

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.627 align:middle
[sighs]

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.421 align:middle
[MIKI]
Here. Take it.

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.214 align:middle
Huh?

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.758 align:middle
[MIKI] If there's something
you really want,

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:16.801 align:middle
then just say so.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:22.515 align:middle
[MIKI] It's an old, bad habit
I wish you'd break.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle
This would go a lot better

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.143 align:middle
with those cookies
you used to bake.

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:27.687 align:middle
That last batch you did actually
turned out pretty well.

00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:29.356 align:middle
Especially the white ones.

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:31.733 align:middle
Reminded me of you.

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.568 align:middle
'Cause they looked like snow.

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.783 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
"Yuki" does mean snow.

00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:45.747 align:middle
Pure white. Like my name.

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:07.686 align:middle
The poor guy.

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.649 align:middle
[phone clatters on floor]

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:23.952 align:middle
Wha...?

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.208 align:middle
Yo.

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.335 align:middle
You're back!

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.007 align:middle
About time. Right?

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.174 align:middle
Yeah.

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:39.968 align:middle
She looks happy.

00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:41.594 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Hmm...

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:44.764 align:middle
Like, duh. Come on, Hori.

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:48.268 align:middle
[HORI] Oh, I should
mention before I forget.

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:50.687 align:middle
Did you get my message about
the changes to the test?

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:51.521 align:middle
Yeah.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:52.939 align:middle
That blows.

00:12:53.023 --> 00:12:54.816 align:middle
They love seein' us squirm.

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.359 align:middle
Though I squirm regardless

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:59.612 align:middle
because I'm essentially crap
at every single subject. Yeah.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:03.867 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Yoshikawa. Can we talk?

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:06.870 align:middle
Sure.

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:35.231 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA] I guess we could
only pretend for so long.

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:38.026 align:middle
Time to wake up from this dream.

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:40.236 align:middle
It's even colder up here
than it was on the ground,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.739 align:middle
and I'm in a skirt,
so can we please make this fast?

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:46.409 align:middle
And I gotta give Hori back
her notebook before next class.

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:47.869 align:middle
Read 'em?

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.622 align:middle
Your texts? Yeah.

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:53.416 align:middle
Didn't reply, but I'm caught up.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.878 align:middle
Kono... told me she liked me.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.508 align:middle
And then she told me
that she didn't need me

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.593 align:middle
to give her a response.

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:10.725 align:middle
Huh? Wait.

00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:11.768 align:middle
She did?

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.269 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Mm-hmm.

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:16.064 align:middle
It's because she bought into
that rumor about us dating

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.315 align:middle
and thinks that I'm taken.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:19.359 align:middle
She confessed anyway
to get it off her chest.

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:21.778 align:middle
Huh...?

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.280 align:middle
So, wait, why not
set her straight?

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:26.825 align:middle
Why didn't you tell her
it was all pretend?

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.201 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Hmm...

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:29.744 align:middle
Guess I don't really know why.

00:14:29.828 --> 00:14:30.954 align:middle
Yeah, it was a misunderstanding.

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:32.747 align:middle
There was no need to explain.

00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:33.957 align:middle
'Cause, I mean,

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.668 align:middle
I made you a promise
that I would play along.

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:40.922 align:middle
'Kay. Let's say you hadn't
made me that promise.

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:44.175 align:middle
How do you think you would
have responded to her then?

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:47.178 align:middle
Please, I'm not stupid
enough think we're on par.

00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:49.806 align:middle
There's no way.

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.224 align:middle
I may not be good for her,

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:54.019 align:middle
but one day, she'll find
someone who's up on her level.

00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:00.692 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Ah. I see.

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:03.528 align:middle
Suppose that means
no more <i>sakura</i> cookies.

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:05.447 align:middle
Bet you're bummed about that.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.198 align:middle
No kidding.

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:10.869 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
I'm shocked.

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:13.621 align:middle
He's so kind and she's so
kind that I thought for sure

00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:15.999 align:middle
she'd be the type
of girl he'd go for.

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:18.251 align:middle
You were my other cookie
supplier for a while.

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:20.628 align:middle
You made 'em nice 'n' burnt.

00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle
Shut your face.

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:24.215 align:middle
I don't burn them anymore.

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:27.844 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
I'm so unfair.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:31.473 align:middle
Kono went to the trouble of
baking him cookies every day.

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.224 align:middle
She worked up the
courage to talk to him

00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:36.519 align:middle
and then found even
more courage to confess.

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:39.314 align:middle
Despite knowing
she'd be rejected.

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:45.195 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA] The only thing
I ever I do is run away.

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.072 align:middle
I'd be lying if
I said I wasn't relieved

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:49.741 align:middle
the two of them won't
be dating anytime soon,

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:52.118 align:middle
though the thought of me
being in the same boat.

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:55.038 align:middle
Of him not reciprocating
my feelings?

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:57.374 align:middle
Makes me scared to breathe.

00:15:57.457 --> 00:16:00.251 align:middle
But... I'll endure it

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:03.588 align:middle
because I want to be
the one at his side.

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:09.135 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA] Doubt I could
be more selfish if I tried.

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:14.140 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA] If she's warm
and sweet cherry blossoms,

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:17.477 align:middle
then I'm gross, muddy,
bone-chilling snow.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.813 align:middle
Just like my name suggests.

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:25.485 align:middle
I can see your breath.

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:26.403 align:middle
It looks cool.

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.029 align:middle
Huh?

00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:31.157 align:middle
I heard today's gonna be
the coldest day of the year.

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:33.618 align:middle
If Mother Nature's gonna force
us to freeze our butts off,

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:35.954 align:middle
the least she could do
is make it snow.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:38.415 align:middle
Maybe compensate for last year.

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:41.501 align:middle
I'm kinda looking forward
to a flurry or two.

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:45.505 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
You're the only person I know

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:46.923 align:middle
who feels that way.

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:48.174 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
You think so?

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:49.718 align:middle
Snow's pretty, though.

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Only when it's freshly fallen.

00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:54.264 align:middle
Shoveling it's a pain.

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.266 align:middle
And there's a good chance
you'll slip and fall.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:57.726 align:middle
Not pretty.

00:16:57.809 --> 00:17:01.062 align:middle
Yeah. Miyamura would
def have plenty of spills.

00:17:01.146 --> 00:17:02.313 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Exactly!

00:17:02.397 --> 00:17:04.399 align:middle
And don't get me started
on the gross, dirty snow

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:06.484 align:middle
that sticks around way too long.

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:09.154 align:middle
Nobody likes that.

00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:10.780 align:middle
People want it to melt.

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:13.450 align:middle
To feel the warmth of spring.

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:29.174 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
The snow doesn't melt

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:31.051 align:middle
just because it's
a different season.

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:32.135 align:middle
Huh?

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:33.303 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
It melts when it wants to.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:35.305 align:middle
So if it decides
it's a good day to go,

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.307 align:middle
then that's all she wrote.

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:41.603 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA] No matter
how badly everyone wants

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:42.896 align:middle
another day with it,

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.482 align:middle
the snow makes
the choice to melt away.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:47.942 align:middle
It calls its own shots.

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:49.694 align:middle
You got that?

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:57.035 align:middle
It gets warmer in the spring

00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:59.037 align:middle
is what I meant.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.872 align:middle
Lemme get this straight.

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:03.750 align:middle
You think that the snow melts
because the <i>sakura</i> blossoms ask?

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:11.883 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA] Are we talking about
the weather or something else?

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:14.886 align:middle
Sounds like you need to go
back to first grade science.

00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:17.097 align:middle
Hey. I'm all right at science.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.265 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA] I can't believe
how serious he was

00:18:19.349 --> 00:18:22.394 align:middle
throughout that entire spiel.

00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:24.437 align:middle
I'm glad he said it, though.

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:26.314 align:middle
Really glad.

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:30.568 align:middle
You trying to break
a world record

00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:32.404 align:middle
for being stupid or what?

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:35.699 align:middle
You just don't want me
to take your title.

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:37.534 align:middle
There.
Got your first real smile today.

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:38.618 align:middle
Huh?

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:41.788 align:middle
How'd you know it's my first?

00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:45.625 align:middle
I just do.

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:49.295 align:middle
Hey, let's get outta this cold.

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:51.131 align:middle
Remind me again
whose bright idea it was

00:18:51.214 --> 00:18:52.799 align:middle
to talk on the roof.

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:56.428 align:middle
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:56.511 --> 00:18:58.388 align:middle
Your hand's warm.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.729 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA] You've got me
hoping we get some snow, too!

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:07.981 align:middle
The pure and pretty kind.

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:13.945 align:middle
What? You think Sakura
has a boyfriend now?

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:15.280 align:middle
Wow. Really?

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:16.865 align:middle
Yeah. Maybe it's just me,

00:19:16.948 --> 00:19:19.784 align:middle
but she seems to have a
little more pep in her step,

00:19:19.868 --> 00:19:21.411 align:middle
doesn't she?

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:23.163 align:middle
You're so wrong.

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.832 align:middle
Bye! Remi's off to tutoring!

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:31.421 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
Despite the tells,

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:33.965 align:middle
she doesn't think Sakura's
the slightest bit happier?

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:36.718 align:middle
Or maybe she was referring
to my boyfriend hypothesis.

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.136 align:middle
Is that it?

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:39.763 align:middle
[KONO]
Sengoku?

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:42.932 align:middle
I hope you haven't been demoted.

00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:47.354 align:middle
Oh. The eraser bits on
the floor were bothering me.

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:50.732 align:middle
First-years should do that,
not student body presidents!

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:52.400 align:middle
I mean, honestly...

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:54.736 align:middle
[SENGOKU] She's definitely
in better spirits.

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:57.947 align:middle
Almost like a weight's been
lifted off her shoulders.

00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:00.867 align:middle
[KONO] Plus, you should open the
window if you're going to clean.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.285 align:middle
Where's Remi?

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.996 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
She had tutoring today.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.832 align:middle
She's our dependable
window-opener, as you know.

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:09.376 align:middle
It's been a while
since I had to do it,

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:12.921 align:middle
so I guess I forgot.

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:14.673 align:middle
Um, I don't mean to pry,

00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:17.884 align:middle
but did something
happen to you recently?

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:19.135 align:middle
You seem much more chipper,

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:21.596 align:middle
so I'd like to believe
it was something good.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.973 align:middle
Though, now
I'm starting to suspect

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.518 align:middle
that may not be the case.

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:28.603 align:middle
Or maybe it's nothing at all.

00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:29.688 align:middle
Sorry.

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:33.024 align:middle
I'm overanalyzing
this way too much.

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:37.320 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
Sakura?

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:39.197 align:middle
Oh. I should probably head home.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.990 align:middle
I'm sorry I can't
help you clean.

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:42.367 align:middle
Hold on. Wait!

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.411 align:middle
Please don't leave like this!

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:46.579 align:middle
[gasps]

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.541 align:middle
Please.

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:53.294 align:middle
Just take a breath and
then tell me what happened.

00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:56.172 align:middle
[KONO]
Nothing happened, Sengoku.

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:00.051 align:middle
I got my heart broken.

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:01.845 align:middle
That's all.

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:04.764 align:middle
[KONO]
I didn't even get a response.

00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:08.226 align:middle
No big deal.

00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:14.524 align:middle
Well, then he's a moron.

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:17.902 align:middle
Straight up stupid.

00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:19.404 align:middle
In fact, I don't want
someone so dumb

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:21.614 align:middle
to be affiliated
with our school.

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:23.616 align:middle
This jerk should be expelled.

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:30.040 align:middle
Shouldn't he?

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:43.678 align:middle
Hey!

00:21:43.762 --> 00:21:52.145 align:middle
[KONO sobs]

00:21:57.192 --> 00:21:59.319 align:middle
[SENGOKU] That was the first
time I ever saw a classmate

00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:02.614 align:middle
break down into
uncontrollable tears.

00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:11.706 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
And since nobody's in the wrong,

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.875 align:middle
it only hurts more.

00:22:18.171 --> 00:22:21.424 align:middle
[SENGOKU] 
Oh, wow. It started snowing.
