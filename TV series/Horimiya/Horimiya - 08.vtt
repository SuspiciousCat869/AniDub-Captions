00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:21.125 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Ah. Found you.

00:00:23.292 --> 00:00:24.583 align:middle
Hey, there.

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle
We're missing gym.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.083 align:middle
I don't have clothes.

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:31.208 align:middle
They threw them away.

00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:34.500 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
In the trash? Oh, that's right.

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle
How could I forget?

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.958 align:middle
[YOUNGER] They look like
they're having so much fun.

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:42.333 align:middle
I hate them.

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:44.917 align:middle
We did, didn't we?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.917 align:middle
And people in cliques
are the absolute worst.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.833 align:middle
Because they made us feel more
excluded than we already were.

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle
[YOUNGER]
I hate break time, too.

00:00:54.083 --> 00:00:55.583 align:middle
Yeah. Breaks were pretty rough.

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:59.167 align:middle
No doubt. I can practically
hear the whispers now.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.250 align:middle
It always felt like kids were
pointing out how alone we were.

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.375 align:middle
I mean they weren't wrong.

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:08.000 align:middle
We hated special events, too.

00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:09.542 align:middle
In fact,

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:10.875 align:middle
I can't remember a single thing

00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.833 align:middle
we didn't hate in those days.

00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle
[YOUNGER]
It sucks.

00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:20.125 align:middle
Nobody needs a
loser like me around.

00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:22.042 align:middle
Can I just die?

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] Um, I think we should
probably hold off on that.

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.167 align:middle
Not much further down the road,
we'll make a friend.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle
He's annoying,
though, so heads up.

00:01:34.583 --> 00:01:36.792 align:middle
Then we'll meet a kid
with great taste in music,

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:39.875 align:middle
a super sweet girl, and a guy
who's as tall as he is kind.

00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:43.792 align:middle
Oh, and a semi-spineless
president and his posse, too.

00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:45.292 align:middle
Believe it or not,

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle
there are a lot of people
who wanna be friends with us.

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:49.833 align:middle
Best of all,

00:01:49.917 --> 00:01:52.542 align:middle
we'll eventually meet
someone who'll cry for us,

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle
and laugh at most of our jokes,

00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:57.417 align:middle
and keep us in line
when we start acting up.

00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:04.500 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I promise she's out there.

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle
If that's true, then I guess...

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I guess...

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:19.583 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] Huh? What was
I just dreaming about?

00:02:21.917 --> 00:02:23.917 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
I wanna see Hori.

00:03:57.042 --> 00:04:00.083 align:middle
[AYASAKI] The boy I fell
in love with is really weak.

00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:04.625 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
And that's not an exaggeration.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.875 align:middle
[AYASAKI] Even if the
occasion calls for it,

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.083 align:middle
he doesn't actually
like yelling at people.

00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:16.875 align:middle
[AYASAKI] He'll laugh about
how bad he is at sports,

00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.167 align:middle
while secretly
wishing he wasn't.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.833 align:middle
Boys and girls alike
can't help but fawn over him.

00:04:23.917 --> 00:04:26.833 align:middle
And their adoration
makes him happy.

00:04:27.792 --> 00:04:32.833 align:middle
[AYASAKI] However, it sometimes
makes him feel anxious, too.

00:04:32.917 --> 00:04:35.375 align:middle
There's so much
he struggles with.

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.583 align:middle
And I love him to pieces for it.

00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:47.208 align:middle
Ah! Oh, no!

00:04:47.292 --> 00:04:48.708 align:middle
Sengoku, save me!

00:04:48.792 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle
There's a spider!

00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:51.792 align:middle
I'm so scared!

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:53.708 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
Judging from that expression,

00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:55.083 align:middle
I'm not the only one.

00:04:56.708 --> 00:05:00.083 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
And yet...

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:02.292 align:middle
...he faced his fears anyway.

00:05:03.458 --> 00:05:04.958 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
Good job.

00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:12.875 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
The boy I love is weak.

00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.292 align:middle
But he doesn't let
that slow him down.

00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:20.292 align:middle
[AYASAKI] Although,
back when we first met,

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:22.917 align:middle
he was almost a
completely different person.

00:05:24.875 --> 00:05:27.083 align:middle
[KAMIOKA sighs]
That Ayasaki, man.

00:05:27.167 --> 00:05:29.208 align:middle
I am crushing like,
so hard on her.

00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:31.917 align:middle
I never get tired of lookin'
at that cute lil' face!

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.250 align:middle
[STUDENT AA]
I totally get what you mean,

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.708 align:middle
but she's kinda
hard to approach.

00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:36.958 align:middle
Like she thinks she's too
good for us or something.

00:05:37.042 --> 00:05:38.542 align:middle
Well, she has ears,

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:41.375 align:middle
so I'm guessing she knows all
the guys have the hots for her.

00:05:41.458 --> 00:05:42.583 align:middle
[STUDENT AA]
Oh and her friend, Kono,

00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:44.167 align:middle
sticks out like a sore thumb.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle
'N I mean really sore,

00:05:45.583 --> 00:05:47.583 align:middle
'cause she looks rough
next to Ayasaki!

00:05:47.667 --> 00:05:48.750 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
I disagree.

00:05:48.833 --> 00:05:50.417 align:middle
I think they're
both petty average.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.417 align:middle
[KAMIOKA] Ayasaki's a hottie
with a body, and you know it!

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.792 align:middle
Not to me.

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle
They both look normal.

00:06:09.917 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle
[AYASAKI] Hey. What were
you reading in class just now?

00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:13.625 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
Hmm?

00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:15.667 align:middle
A manga?

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.625 align:middle
Goethe.

00:06:16.708 --> 00:06:17.583 align:middle
Ger-ta?

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:18.833 align:middle
Um, what is that?

00:06:18.917 --> 00:06:20.583 align:middle
A renowned German author.

00:06:20.667 --> 00:06:22.792 align:middle
I thought you meant
the title at first.

00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:24.417 align:middle
Is it good?

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.833 align:middle
Does your interest mean
you like books, too?

00:06:26.917 --> 00:06:29.792 align:middle
I won't have my nose in one like
that during class, but yeah.

00:06:29.875 --> 00:06:31.167 align:middle
Books are awesome.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.875 align:middle
Like, Grimm's Fairy Tales.

00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.292 align:middle
So, Snow White-type stuff?

00:06:34.375 --> 00:06:36.583 align:middle
Yeah, that's right up my alley.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.083 align:middle
[SENGOKU] I brought
books for you to borrow.

00:06:44.167 --> 00:06:45.583 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
No way! You did?

00:06:45.667 --> 00:06:47.625 align:middle
There're lots of stories
to choose from.

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:50.792 align:middle
So you're bound
to like one or two.

00:06:50.875 --> 00:06:52.708 align:middle
Whoa! Thanks so much!

00:06:52.792 --> 00:06:54.375 align:middle
That looks like
it'll be a fun read.

00:06:54.458 --> 00:06:56.208 align:middle
Yup!

00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:02.542 align:middle
Oh. Do you enjoy
books like these, too?

00:07:02.625 --> 00:07:05.375 align:middle
You're asking me? I do.

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:08.708 align:middle
Then, once Ayasaki's finished,
you can borrow them as well.

00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:09.958 align:middle
The third story
in this collection

00:07:10.042 --> 00:07:12.708 align:middle
is really captivating.
It's one of my faves.

00:07:12.792 --> 00:07:14.542 align:middle
Wait, are you positive?

00:07:14.625 --> 00:07:15.833 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
Mm-hmm.

00:07:15.917 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle
Gosh! Thank you!

00:07:17.583 --> 00:07:19.208 align:middle
Sure. Don't mention it.

00:07:21.917 --> 00:07:24.583 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
You know, you have great taste!

00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:26.333 align:middle
I liked 'em all!

00:07:26.417 --> 00:07:27.792 align:middle
Good, 'cause I brought more.

00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:30.458 align:middle
Wow. You're like
a one-man library.

00:07:30.542 --> 00:07:31.458 align:middle
That's amazing!

00:07:31.542 --> 00:07:32.958 align:middle
How many books do you own?

00:07:33.042 --> 00:07:34.792 align:middle
My parents own most of these.

00:07:34.875 --> 00:07:37.833 align:middle
We have a room filled wall-to-
wall with them back home.

00:07:37.917 --> 00:07:39.292 align:middle
That sounds insane!

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:40.833 align:middle
I wish I could see.

00:07:40.917 --> 00:07:43.542 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
You can if you want to.

00:07:44.333 --> 00:07:45.792 align:middle
Oh! Did I say that?

00:07:45.875 --> 00:07:47.333 align:middle
I didn't mean anything weird!

00:07:47.417 --> 00:07:48.750 align:middle
Yeah. Of course.

00:07:48.833 --> 00:07:50.750 align:middle
Neither did I.

00:07:54.042 --> 00:07:55.375 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
Ahh!

00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:58.500 align:middle
It is filled wall-to-wall!

00:07:58.583 --> 00:08:00.125 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
We don't clean this room much.

00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:01.583 align:middle
I'm sorry that it's so dusty.

00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:02.708 align:middle
[books tumbling]

00:08:02.792 --> 00:08:04.042 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
Oh!

00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:05.125 align:middle
You okay?

00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:06.458 align:middle
Yes, I'm fine!

00:08:06.542 --> 00:08:09.083 align:middle
I was just trying to pull
down this book, is all.

00:08:09.167 --> 00:08:11.875 align:middle
I should've asked
before I touched, though.

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.125 align:middle
Won't find many
books older than that.

00:08:14.208 --> 00:08:15.792 align:middle
Do you remember the premise?

00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:18.792 align:middle
I think it's about the day
before the world ends.

00:08:18.875 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle
Ohh...

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:21.333 align:middle
As in the whole world?

00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:22.792 align:middle
Or Japan?

00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:24.708 align:middle
I believe it's the whole world.

00:08:24.792 --> 00:08:26.333 align:middle
So, they're in panic mode.

00:08:26.417 --> 00:08:28.583 align:middle
If everything was going up
in smoke the next day,

00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:31.708 align:middle
most people would probably
just lie around and wait for it.

00:08:31.792 --> 00:08:33.083 align:middle
Oh, not me!

00:08:33.167 --> 00:08:35.250 align:middle
I'd spend that whole day
blowing through my money.

00:08:35.333 --> 00:08:36.750 align:middle
Then load up on desserts!

00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:38.333 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
Huh?!

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:40.542 align:middle
It's your final day on Earth and
you're gonna stuff your face?

00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:42.833 align:middle
There's so much I haven't tried!

00:08:42.917 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle
So I might as well!

00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:45.875 align:middle
Huh.

00:08:47.208 --> 00:08:48.292 align:middle
Your hair.

00:08:48.375 --> 00:08:51.417 align:middle
It's up higher than it
usually is, right?

00:08:52.583 --> 00:08:55.125 align:middle
Yeah. I just felt like it.

00:08:55.208 --> 00:08:57.000 align:middle
Nice call. Looks good.

00:08:57.083 --> 00:08:58.833 align:middle
You think so?

00:09:05.458 --> 00:09:06.958 align:middle
[KAMIOKA] Cute people
could get away with murder

00:09:07.042 --> 00:09:08.708 align:middle
and look cute doing it!

00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:12.625 align:middle
But I guess you wouldn't get
where I'm coming from, huh?

00:09:12.708 --> 00:09:14.500 align:middle
Mind if I borrow you
for a second?

00:09:14.583 --> 00:09:15.958 align:middle
Pretty please?

00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.250 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
Thanks for lending me these.

00:09:18.333 --> 00:09:20.167 align:middle
I read every last page!

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.042 align:middle
[SENGOKU] There was no
need to rush through them.

00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:23.542 align:middle
I didn't.

00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:25.625 align:middle
They were so entertaining
that I couldn't put them down!

00:09:25.708 --> 00:09:27.625 align:middle
And that one book made
me realize how much

00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle
I don't want the world to end.

00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:31.083 align:middle
What about your
big sweets binge?

00:09:31.167 --> 00:09:32.375 align:middle
[AYASAKI] There are way
more important things

00:09:32.458 --> 00:09:33.958 align:middle
than sweets when
it's judgment day!

00:09:34.042 --> 00:09:36.458 align:middle
[laughs]

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.375 align:middle
So you know.

00:09:41.458 --> 00:09:43.583 align:middle
He's staring 'cause
he has a crush on you.

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:45.083 align:middle
'Kay.

00:09:46.042 --> 00:09:50.875 align:middle
Hey. Would it be cool if I came
over to your place again today?

00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.083 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
Sure. But...

00:09:53.167 --> 00:09:54.875 align:middle
Just to be clear.
You're coming for the books

00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.333 align:middle
and not to spend time
with only me, right?

00:09:57.417 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle
You know.

00:09:58.333 --> 00:10:00.542 align:middle
Don't wanna get the wrong idea.

00:10:04.167 --> 00:10:06.375 align:middle
[SENGOKU] This is a series
you'll totally be into.

00:10:06.458 --> 00:10:10.375 align:middle
It's long, but a
very satisfying read.

00:10:10.458 --> 00:10:12.417 align:middle
Neat. I can't wait.

00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:17.708 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
Um. Sengoku.

00:10:17.792 --> 00:10:18.958 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
Hmm?

00:10:19.042 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle
[AYASAKI] I, uh, kinda,
sorta had a question.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle
Then shoot.

00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:27.333 align:middle
Okay, then.

00:10:27.417 --> 00:10:29.333 align:middle
It's hypothetical.

00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:30.458 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
Hmm?

00:10:30.542 --> 00:10:31.500 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
If you knew without a doubt

00:10:31.583 --> 00:10:33.333 align:middle
the world was gonna
end tomorrow,

00:10:33.417 --> 00:10:35.208 align:middle
what would you honestly do?

00:10:35.292 --> 00:10:36.833 align:middle
What?

00:10:36.917 --> 00:10:38.750 align:middle
Like in the book?

00:10:38.833 --> 00:10:41.083 align:middle
Well, that inspired it.

00:10:41.167 --> 00:10:42.625 align:middle
Yeah.

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:44.625 align:middle
I would confess that I like you.

00:10:44.708 --> 00:10:46.333 align:middle
Huh?

00:10:48.042 --> 00:10:50.375 align:middle
[SENGOKU] Then I'd
dissolve into space dust.

00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:52.042 align:middle
The End.

00:10:57.458 --> 00:10:59.792 align:middle
That supposed to be a joke?

00:10:59.875 --> 00:11:01.042 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
No.

00:11:02.667 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
I was serious.

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.333 align:middle
[SENGOKU]
Forget I said anything.

00:11:09.417 --> 00:11:10.958 align:middle
[gasps]

00:11:11.042 --> 00:11:13.167 align:middle
Uh!

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.583 align:middle
What are you embarrassed for?

00:11:14.667 --> 00:11:16.083 align:middle
Who says that I'm embarrassed?

00:11:16.167 --> 00:11:17.333 align:middle
Because I'm not!

00:11:17.417 --> 00:11:19.083 align:middle
It isn't very nice to lie.

00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:21.125 align:middle
What reason would
I have to lie to you?

00:11:21.208 --> 00:11:22.542 align:middle
Just let it go!

00:11:22.625 --> 00:11:23.833 align:middle
Wanna know how I know?

00:11:23.917 --> 00:11:26.167 align:middle
Your face is almost
completely red!

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.917 align:middle
Looks cute.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.458 align:middle
Whatever you say.

00:11:29.542 --> 00:11:31.292 align:middle
Guess what?

00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:33.125 align:middle
You're not alone
in feeling that way.

00:11:33.208 --> 00:11:34.958 align:middle
Remi likes you, too!

00:11:39.667 --> 00:11:41.875 align:middle
The thing is,

00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.458 align:middle
I like you a lot, Remi.

00:11:46.833 --> 00:11:48.625 align:middle
Thanks for loaning me this.

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.292 align:middle
Ah! You read the
whole thing in a day?

00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:54.833 align:middle
[SENGOKU] I finished studying
early, so I had some extra time.

00:11:54.917 --> 00:11:56.000 align:middle
Impressive.

00:11:56.083 --> 00:11:57.333 align:middle
And your thoughts?

00:11:57.417 --> 00:12:00.208 align:middle
Manage to squeeze any tears out?

00:12:00.292 --> 00:12:02.917 align:middle
No, but it was all right.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.417 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
He was lying.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.083 align:middle
He cried like a baby
while reading it.

00:12:08.083 --> 00:12:09.292 align:middle
[AYASAKI]
When we met,

00:12:09.375 --> 00:12:12.042 align:middle
he didn't let the opinions
of others sway him.

00:12:12.125 --> 00:12:15.083 align:middle
I loved him then,
and I love him now.

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:20.250 align:middle
His weak points, his inability
to lie, his perseverance.

00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:22.708 align:middle
I love every part of him.

00:12:24.667 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle
So, um...

00:12:25.583 --> 00:12:27.500 align:middle
You training to be a beautician?

00:12:27.583 --> 00:12:29.667 align:middle
[HORI] Eh. I found some
unopened bottles of nail polish

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:30.917 align:middle
while I was cleaning my room,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.917 align:middle
and I thought this color
would look good on you.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.417 align:middle
I see.

00:12:39.167 --> 00:12:41.125 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Wha-- Oh, no.

00:12:41.208 --> 00:12:43.542 align:middle
Must resist all temptation.

00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:45.000 align:middle
Think of how mad she'd be.

00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:47.542 align:middle
[HORI]
Okay. Time for the other foot!

00:12:47.625 --> 00:12:49.542 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
But...

00:12:49.625 --> 00:12:50.833 align:middle
[HORI]
Miyamura?

00:12:50.917 --> 00:12:53.083 align:middle
Stop daydreaming
and give me your--

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.167 align:middle
My foot's on your head

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:08.292 align:middle
because I thought
I might level up?

00:13:09.667 --> 00:13:11.000 align:middle
Huh?

00:13:11.083 --> 00:13:11.958 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
It was a joke!

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:13.083 align:middle
You're always messing with me,

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:14.333 align:middle
so I figured I'd try
messing with you,

00:13:14.417 --> 00:13:15.292 align:middle
but I'm an idiot!

00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:16.833 align:middle
An extremely sorry idiot!

00:13:16.917 --> 00:13:19.208 align:middle
It's not that big a deal,
so calm down.

00:13:19.292 --> 00:13:20.708 align:middle
I'm not upset with you.

00:13:20.792 --> 00:13:22.500 align:middle
I'm just a little surprised.

00:13:22.583 --> 00:13:25.333 align:middle
I mean, you're constantly going
off on Shindo and Sawada,

00:13:25.417 --> 00:13:26.542 align:middle
but when you're around me,

00:13:26.625 --> 00:13:28.375 align:middle
you're like the
paragon of courtesy.

00:13:28.458 --> 00:13:30.000 align:middle
So is all that a front?

00:13:30.083 --> 00:13:31.958 align:middle
Are you faking it for me?

00:13:32.042 --> 00:13:32.875 align:middle
It's real!

00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.292 align:middle
How I act around you is real.

00:13:35.375 --> 00:13:36.667 align:middle
Oh.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:37.750 align:middle
What's wrong?

00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:39.417 align:middle
Would you prefer
if I yelled a bunch

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.292 align:middle
and headbutted you
like you were one of them?

00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:43.708 align:middle
What? No way!

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.083 align:middle
Damn!
C'mon and move your ass, Kyoko!

00:13:47.167 --> 00:13:50.125 align:middle
The hell d'ya think you're
talkin' to, ya dumb bitch?

00:13:50.208 --> 00:13:51.625 align:middle
But... hot role-play.

00:13:51.708 --> 00:13:52.708 align:middle
Huh?!

00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:55.833 align:middle
[door opens]

00:13:55.917 --> 00:13:57.125 align:middle
Good mornin', Miyamura.

00:13:57.208 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle
'Sup? You fellas doin' good?

00:13:59.083 --> 00:14:01.042 align:middle
Not that I care.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.792 align:middle
Okay.

00:14:04.875 --> 00:14:06.083 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
What do we have here?

00:14:06.167 --> 00:14:08.292 align:middle
You seriously still
listening to this crap?

00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:10.417 align:middle
They're all bops, but damn!

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.417 align:middle
The hell? What's going on?

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.917 align:middle
Hey, Miyamura.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.375 align:middle
Could I borrow your
Math B textbook, please?

00:14:16.458 --> 00:14:18.792 align:middle
You need to get your shit
together as soon as possible,

00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:21.000 align:middle
but I feel generous today.

00:14:21.083 --> 00:14:22.458 align:middle
Explain! Who is that guy?

00:14:22.542 --> 00:14:23.333 align:middle
How should I know?!

00:14:23.417 --> 00:14:24.917 align:middle
I'm as clueless as you are!

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.958 align:middle
Somethin' you wanna
share with the class?

00:14:27.042 --> 00:14:27.875 align:middle
Kill me.

00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.542 align:middle
Eh?

00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:30.750 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
I take it Her Royal Highness

00:14:30.833 --> 00:14:33.208 align:middle
the Ice Queen
asked you to "act hard?"

00:14:33.292 --> 00:14:35.917 align:middle
If you're uncomfortable behaving
this way, then tell her.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.208 align:middle
Good morning!

00:14:37.292 --> 00:14:38.292 align:middle
Man up, son!

00:14:38.375 --> 00:14:39.708 align:middle
Or I'll beat you
senseless till you do!

00:14:39.792 --> 00:14:41.583 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Stop making this my problem!

00:14:41.667 --> 00:14:44.625 align:middle
[HORI] Aw. Shame it was
so tough for you.

00:14:44.708 --> 00:14:47.667 align:middle
I guess your dominating side
will only live on in my dreams.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.250 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Well, maybe I'll give you time

00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:51.667 align:middle
to forget about it
then try again.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.667 align:middle
[HORI]
Really? Oh, man. I can't wait!

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:55.625 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
Peace.

00:14:55.708 --> 00:14:57.125 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Se ya later!

00:14:57.208 --> 00:14:58.375 align:middle
[HORI]
'Kay!

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.083 align:middle
Wait. I'm almost
positive the Physics room

00:15:05.167 --> 00:15:06.708 align:middle
isn't open during lunchtime.

00:15:06.792 --> 00:15:08.542 align:middle
[HORI]
Hmm? Oh, shoot!

00:15:08.625 --> 00:15:10.167 align:middle
I think you're right.

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:11.667 align:middle
What a pain.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.542 align:middle
I'll have to wait till after
the break to drop these off,

00:15:13.625 --> 00:15:14.833 align:middle
so can you let our teacher know?

00:15:14.917 --> 00:15:15.667 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Want me to go?

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle
[HORI]
Nah, I got it.

00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:22.750 align:middle
[YANAGI]
Excuse me.

00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:23.833 align:middle
Do you have a moment?

00:15:23.917 --> 00:15:25.208 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Me?

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:27.917 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Hmm...

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.125 align:middle
I know I said
I'd wait till she forgot,

00:15:30.208 --> 00:15:33.417 align:middle
but I doubt she thinks
I'll try anything right now.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.792 align:middle
What kind of dirtbag
thing could I say or do

00:15:35.875 --> 00:15:38.667 align:middle
to make her happy, though?

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.292 align:middle
Oh! Guess what, Miyamura!

00:15:42.833 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] Who exactly
do you're talking to,

00:15:44.833 --> 00:15:46.625 align:middle
you frickin' airhead?

00:15:46.708 --> 00:15:48.583 align:middle
I ain't your friend,
so back the hell off,

00:15:48.667 --> 00:15:50.792 align:middle
and shut the hell up!

00:15:57.833 --> 00:15:58.583 align:middle
I'm sorry, Hori.

00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:00.208 align:middle
But I just can't do this.

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:02.250 align:middle
So don't expect
a repeat of that.

00:16:04.125 --> 00:16:05.917 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] I've never
been more lost in the maze

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.458 align:middle
that is your mind.

00:16:18.417 --> 00:16:19.417 align:middle
[HORI]
I kid you not!

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.583 align:middle
And now they're
all taking about how

00:16:20.667 --> 00:16:22.542 align:middle
we were fighting in the AV room!

00:16:22.625 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle
They honestly believe we
were having a "lover's quarrel."

00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:28.583 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] I feel guilty
for freaking those two out.

00:16:28.667 --> 00:16:29.625 align:middle
[HORI]
Hey, Yuki.

00:16:29.708 --> 00:16:31.042 align:middle
Are you okay?

00:16:31.125 --> 00:16:32.375 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Uh?

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:35.292 align:middle
Yeah. I...

00:16:35.375 --> 00:16:36.833 align:middle
What?

00:16:37.625 --> 00:16:39.333 align:middle
[HORI]
Someone asked you out?

00:16:39.417 --> 00:16:40.292 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Mm-hmm.

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:41.875 align:middle
Happened four days ago.

00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:42.958 align:middle
That long?

00:16:43.042 --> 00:16:44.292 align:middle
[HORI]
Don't leave him hanging.

00:16:44.375 --> 00:16:46.167 align:middle
It's been a minute
because I haven't figured out

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.417 align:middle
how to turn him down!

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.833 align:middle
You're not even
gonna give 'im a shot?

00:16:48.917 --> 00:16:50.208 align:middle
Well, of course not!

00:16:50.292 --> 00:16:52.375 align:middle
We're complete strangers.

00:16:52.458 --> 00:16:56.375 align:middle
Also, he looked so serious
about everything he said.

00:16:56.458 --> 00:16:58.458 align:middle
I feel bad replying
with a, "Sorry, dude.

00:16:58.542 --> 00:17:01.625 align:middle
But thanks for playing,"
you know?

00:17:02.583 --> 00:17:04.000 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
Oh!

00:17:04.083 --> 00:17:06.083 align:middle
You could let him down easy
if you had a fake boyfriend.

00:17:06.167 --> 00:17:07.083 align:middle
Toru!

00:17:07.167 --> 00:17:08.667 align:middle
Oh, he would hate that!

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.667 align:middle
If you explain it,
he'll play along.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:12.208 align:middle
What makes you think he won't?

00:17:12.292 --> 00:17:13.833 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
I dunno.

00:17:13.917 --> 00:17:16.083 align:middle
[MIYAMURA] Uh-huh.
It's going down after school.

00:17:16.167 --> 00:17:18.292 align:middle
Yup. See ya then.

00:17:18.375 --> 00:17:19.583 align:middle
Ishikawa's officially in!

00:17:19.667 --> 00:17:21.292 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
That was fast!

00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:23.917 align:middle
All right.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.250 align:middle
So what's the game plan?

00:17:25.333 --> 00:17:27.375 align:middle
Well, I was thinking while
she's turning him down,

00:17:27.458 --> 00:17:29.375 align:middle
you could be busy
feeling her up.

00:17:29.458 --> 00:17:31.708 align:middle
Slow your roll there,
Satan, that's way too dirty!

00:17:31.792 --> 00:17:33.167 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
C'mon, Hori!

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:34.917 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA]
What class is he in, anyway?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.583 align:middle
Class six, I think?

00:17:36.667 --> 00:17:38.625 align:middle
Yep. And his name is Yanagi.

00:17:38.708 --> 00:17:40.042 align:middle
Before we do this, though,

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:41.458 align:middle
am I the best fit?

00:17:41.542 --> 00:17:42.833 align:middle
Wouldn't you prefer,
oh, I dunno,

00:17:42.917 --> 00:17:45.125 align:middle
someone who actually
qualifies as hot?

00:17:45.208 --> 00:17:46.792 align:middle
Well, as far as
looks are concerned,

00:17:46.875 --> 00:17:48.625 align:middle
I'd say you have Yanagi beat.

00:17:48.708 --> 00:17:49.875 align:middle
So you'll do just fine.

00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:50.958 align:middle
Okay.

00:17:51.042 --> 00:17:52.417 align:middle
But you only have 'im
beat by a hair!

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.833 align:middle
My hair or his?

00:17:53.917 --> 00:17:56.125 align:middle
[HORI] We should
probably get a move on.

00:17:57.333 --> 00:17:58.583 align:middle
Are you coming with us?

00:17:59.792 --> 00:18:00.667 align:middle
Heck yeah I am!

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.000 align:middle
It's bestie support time!

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:05.042 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Eh. Thanks, Hori.

00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:06.750 align:middle
We doin' this?

00:18:06.833 --> 00:18:08.167 align:middle
Um.

00:18:11.583 --> 00:18:13.083 align:middle
You're my girlfriend now, right?

00:18:13.167 --> 00:18:14.625 align:middle
Let's go.

00:18:20.083 --> 00:18:22.083 align:middle
I forget who's
even in class six.

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:23.125 align:middle
[MIYAMURA]
It's hard to remember

00:18:23.208 --> 00:18:25.208 align:middle
when you don't
see 'em all the time.

00:18:25.292 --> 00:18:27.917 align:middle
Maybe Ayasaki knows him.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.292 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Just for today.

00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.208 align:middle
All you have
to do is stand there.

00:18:34.292 --> 00:18:35.667 align:middle
I'll handle the talking.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:36.792 align:middle
You sure?

00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle
You agreed to
help me out with this,

00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:39.375 align:middle
so it's the least I can do.

00:18:39.458 --> 00:18:42.042 align:middle
It's a pretty big sacrifice.

00:18:42.125 --> 00:18:44.542 align:middle
But I wouldn't mind
if I got just one word in.

00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:46.458 align:middle
Something that sounds tough.

00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:47.625 align:middle
I'll be like,

00:18:47.708 --> 00:18:49.583 align:middle
"She's mine, pal,
so keep your hands off."

00:18:49.667 --> 00:18:51.125 align:middle
Huh?

00:18:51.208 --> 00:18:53.500 align:middle
Look, you're only supposed to
pretend to be my boyfriend!

00:18:53.583 --> 00:18:54.958 align:middle
That was pretend.

00:18:55.042 --> 00:18:55.833 align:middle
Whatever.

00:18:55.917 --> 00:18:57.958 align:middle
Chime in if you want to.

00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.083 align:middle
I can't hear a thing.

00:19:01.167 --> 00:19:01.958 align:middle
Oh!

00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:04.125 align:middle
There he is!

00:19:04.208 --> 00:19:06.208 align:middle
[YANAGI]
Sorry I'm late, Yoshikawa!

00:19:06.292 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle
Thanks for waiting!

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.000 align:middle
I was held up by my teacher.

00:19:15.083 --> 00:19:17.417 align:middle
[HORI, MIYAMURA]
Holy crap, he's gorgeous!

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.000 align:middle
[HORI] He's a zillion
times hotter than Toru!

00:19:20.083 --> 00:19:21.000 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Come on.

00:19:21.083 --> 00:19:23.125 align:middle
Uh! Yeah, I, um... Hi.

00:19:23.208 --> 00:19:24.958 align:middle
Oh. Nice to meet you.

00:19:25.042 --> 00:19:27.000 align:middle
I'm Akane Yanagi from class six.

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:29.000 align:middle
He's sexy and a cool name?

00:19:29.083 --> 00:19:31.250 align:middle
Ishikawa. From class one.

00:19:31.333 --> 00:19:32.792 align:middle
[HORI]
Not even Miyamura holds a candle

00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:34.917 align:middle
to the walking
cover model over here!

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.417 align:middle
You can do this, Ishikawa!

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.208 align:middle
[YANAGI]
Hmm...

00:19:39.292 --> 00:19:41.750 align:middle
I see. You're taken.

00:19:41.833 --> 00:19:44.750 align:middle
Yeah. I'm sorry.

00:19:44.833 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle
[ISHIKAWA] I'm genetically
inferior on every level.

00:19:46.583 --> 00:19:48.625 align:middle
Hell, if he asked me out,
I'd say yes in a heartbeat!

00:19:48.708 --> 00:19:50.125 align:middle
Yoshikawa's out
of her damn mind!

00:19:50.208 --> 00:19:51.500 align:middle
[YANAGI]
Guess it can't be helped.

00:19:51.583 --> 00:19:52.958 align:middle
Not only is he cool,

00:19:53.042 --> 00:19:55.333 align:middle
but your boyfriend's clearly
more attractive than I am.

00:19:55.417 --> 00:19:56.958 align:middle
Dig my grave already!

00:19:57.042 --> 00:19:58.917 align:middle
Well, best be on my way.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.833 align:middle
Oh. Bye.

00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:05.542 align:middle
Yuki! You sidestepped
a stud muffin?

00:20:05.625 --> 00:20:08.750 align:middle
No? Well, yes.
But he's kinda too dreamy.

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:11.083 align:middle
Plus, I think he's
into fancy food,

00:20:11.167 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle
and that's not my scene.

00:20:12.083 --> 00:20:13.500 align:middle
[HORI, MIYAMURA]
So she's a pleb.

00:20:13.583 --> 00:20:14.583 align:middle
For a split second,

00:20:14.667 --> 00:20:16.125 align:middle
I thought I died
and went to heaven.

00:20:16.208 --> 00:20:18.333 align:middle
And he was a beautiful angel.

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:19.833 align:middle
Who would've guessed
we had someone like that

00:20:19.917 --> 00:20:22.000 align:middle
in our grade this whole time.

00:20:23.167 --> 00:20:24.625 align:middle
Remi knows him.

00:20:24.708 --> 00:20:25.875 align:middle
He's hot, huh?

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:28.375 align:middle
And to top it off
he's hilarious!

00:20:28.458 --> 00:20:29.792 align:middle
Hilarious how?

00:20:30.708 --> 00:20:32.000 align:middle
[YANAGI]
Ouch!

00:20:32.083 --> 00:20:34.083 align:middle
Yanagi. Your glasses?

00:20:34.167 --> 00:20:36.792 align:middle
Yeah. I haven't
bought a new pair yet.

00:20:36.875 --> 00:20:38.875 align:middle
But even without them,
I should--

00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:39.958 align:middle
[STUDENT CC]
There's a door there!

00:20:40.042 --> 00:20:41.417 align:middle
Happens more often
than you'd think!

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.958 align:middle
Oh. Wow.

00:20:43.042 --> 00:20:46.083 align:middle
His eyes are super bad,
but he's still cute!

00:20:46.167 --> 00:20:47.958 align:middle
He can't see?

00:20:55.417 --> 00:20:57.000 align:middle
Hey. Wait!

00:20:57.083 --> 00:20:58.167 align:middle
Yes?

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.917 align:middle
I think you mistook me
for somebody else!

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:04.542 align:middle
[YOSHIKAWA]
Yeah. So, like,

00:21:04.625 --> 00:21:06.750 align:middle
there's a girl named Kyoko Hori
I'm best friends with.

00:21:06.833 --> 00:21:08.583 align:middle
She's about this
much taller than me.

00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:10.583 align:middle
And prettier! By a mile.

00:21:10.667 --> 00:21:12.958 align:middle
Are you sure you didn't
mean to ask her out?

00:21:13.042 --> 00:21:15.708 align:middle
Uh? Why would you...?

00:21:15.792 --> 00:21:18.042 align:middle
Ah! You must've talked
to one of my classmates

00:21:18.125 --> 00:21:20.292 align:middle
and found out how
bad my eyes are.

00:21:22.042 --> 00:21:24.375 align:middle
[YANAGI]
I had the right person.

00:21:24.458 --> 00:21:26.292 align:middle
I've liked you for a while now,

00:21:26.375 --> 00:21:28.333 align:middle
so I know what you look like.

00:21:28.417 --> 00:21:30.792 align:middle
I can't say the same for
this friend of yours, though.

00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle
Oh. Uh. Okay.

00:21:33.833 --> 00:21:34.958 align:middle
[HORI]
Yuki!

00:21:35.042 --> 00:21:35.792 align:middle
Hori.

00:21:35.875 --> 00:21:36.875 align:middle
Uh, I'm sorry!

00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:38.042 align:middle
Did I interrupt you?

00:21:38.125 --> 00:21:39.708 align:middle
Oh. Hey, what's up, Yanagi?

00:21:39.792 --> 00:21:40.917 align:middle
You're Hori?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.292 align:middle
Yoshikawa was just
telling me about you!

00:21:43.375 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle
Her very tall, good-looking
friend, or so she says.

00:21:46.333 --> 00:21:48.167 align:middle
I'm another friend.
Miyamura.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.458 align:middle
Oops! Sorry!

00:21:49.542 --> 00:21:51.667 align:middle
I didn't realize you
were here, too, Ishikawa!

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:52.667 align:middle
I'm Hori.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:53.625 align:middle
What?

00:21:53.708 --> 00:21:54.708 align:middle
Then who might you be?

00:21:54.792 --> 00:21:57.250 align:middle
We literally met yesterday.

00:21:57.333 --> 00:21:59.875 align:middle
[YANAGI] You'll have to
forgive me, uh, Miyamura!

00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:02.333 align:middle
His eyesight's
kinda on the fritz.

00:22:02.417 --> 00:22:03.792 align:middle
Gee, ya think?

00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:05.542 align:middle
Oh, gosh! I, uh...

00:22:05.625 --> 00:22:07.875 align:middle
You're probably wondering
why I'm with your girlfriend!

00:22:07.958 --> 00:22:09.792 align:middle
But I promise
we were just talking.

00:22:09.875 --> 00:22:10.958 align:middle
Huh?

00:22:11.042 --> 00:22:12.083 align:middle
Hey, Hori?

00:22:12.167 --> 00:22:13.708 align:middle
Where did Ishikawa go?

00:22:13.792 --> 00:22:15.125 align:middle
Right here.

00:22:15.208 --> 00:22:16.833 align:middle
[MIYAMURA, HORI,]
This is hilarious.
