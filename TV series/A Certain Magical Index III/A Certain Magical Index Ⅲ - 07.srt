Um...

It's my fault for asking the

he's issued a challenge

to the English Puritan Church,
and to Academy City, too.

Honestly.

give it a rest?

Well, if they're targeting me,

then they must have too much
free time on their hands.

possess saintly powers.

Damn it, Itsuwa.

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,666
She's got the perfect
opportunity to go on the attack,

103

and it's all "business this"
and "business that."

even aware of the weapons

What do you mean, weapons?

Why, I'm referring to

00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,625
the "Undercover Bra
Busters Theory"!

110
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,833
Interesting hypothesis,
Your Holiness,

111
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,458
but is there any basis for it?

112
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,291
[ISAHAYA] If you're just
making random predictions,

113
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,166
then you're better off saving
them for the horse races.

114
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,583
[chuckles] The "Itsuwa
Massage Operation"

115
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,500
that I conducted yielded
promising results,

116
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,708
and I believe you'll agree
they support my theory.

117
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,083
Her shoulder stiffness
index was forty.

118
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,291
However, factoring in
clothing and equipment

119
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,333
to calculate the load
on her shoulders,

120
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,333
a stiffness index
greater than thirty-seven

121
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,375
can only be explained
by one thing!

122
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,041
So you mean...

123
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,291
Yes. Something's
causing that stiffness.

124
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,458
And thus, my "Undercover
Bra Buster Theory"

125
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:29,500
is proven.

126

That said, however,

00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,333
if I wish to explore
this theory to the fullest,

130
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,208
I'm going to need a new tactic.

she's never gonna make

the first move.

Hey, Index. Can you hear me?

but will you please bite
me before you explode?

If you bleed off some of
your anger little by little,

I think it will reduce
the chances of my head

Yes. I may be here

[INDEX]
It's beautiful!

321
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,250
Is this entire place
really underground?

322
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,875
It looks like there's a river
over there, and even a forest.

323
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,750
You gotta admit,
Academy City really is amazing.

324
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,458
Look, you can see it from here!

325
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,541
That's it!

326
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,375
[MIKOTO]
Ugh. This is so annoying.

327
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,625
Here I was worried about him,

328
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,375
and what does that
idiot go and do?

329
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,208
[MIKOTO]
One adult, please.

330
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,458
How many times
do I need to come?

331
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,166
That's really all I'm getting?

332
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,875
I have to say, they're
not making it very easy

333
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,083
to collect stamps.

334
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,916
I wonder if I could
get two stamps

335
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,125
if I bring Kuroko
with me next time.

336
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,208
Bring me, Sissy!

337
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,333
Nope, forget it.

338
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,458
I'll collect them all on my own!

[CHILD 07A laughing]

340
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,333
[MIKOTO] Huh? What the heck do
you think you're doing here?!

341
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,208
Shh! Bath time is quiet time!

342
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,083
[INDEX] You don't need your
towel in the water, you know.

343
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,250
Right.

344
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,791
[MIKOTO gasps]

345
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,708
Wait! You're the girl
that idiot clung to

346
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,250
because of the soccer ball!

347
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,791
No! It's not what
it looked like!

348
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,416
You see...
It was an accident.

349
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,333
I was just lucky that my
breasts happened to be there.

350
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,916
It wasn't like I planned it.

351
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,791
[MIKOTO] I wonder if
either of those girls know

352
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,708
about that idiot
and his amnesia.

353
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:00,250
I mean, he'd probably tell
them sooner than he'd tell me.

354
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,458
Not that I care
one way or the other!

355
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,083
Why am I getting so
upset about somebody

356
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,875
so obnoxious?

357
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,708
[sighs] He really is nothing
but a nuisance.

358
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,458
[INDEX] Uh-oh, looks like the
short-haired one is going under.

359
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,625
We have to save her!

360
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,666
Aw, man. that's really hot.

361
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,416
I should've gone
with iced coffee.

362
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,333
[ITSUWA]
Enjoying the evening breeze?

363
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,666
It's nice, huh?

364
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,791
[KAMIJO] It's so easy to
forget you're underground.

365
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,458
In that case, do you
want to take a little walk?

366
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,416
[KAMIJO] Sure. Wait...
But what about Index?

367
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,291
[ITSUWA] Last I saw
she was running around

368
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,291
in the all-you-can-eat section.

369
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,666
She was?

370
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,083
Well, then I guess we
don't have to worry

371
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,583
about losing her.

372
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,750
You know, this really
is an amazing place.

373
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,291
How many times have
you been here before?

374
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,666
This is her big chance.

375
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,208
There's definitely
a nice mood happening.

376
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,833
Well, Your Holiness.

377
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,250
What do you wanna do now?

378
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,666
What? About the
evening date operation?

379
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,166
No. I mean about
Acqua of the Rear.

380
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,708
Oh.

381
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:14,875
We've received reports about
him from Academy City, but...

382
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,041
[USHIBUKA]
I know. It's hard to believe.

383
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,833
It would be strange
for all three factions

384
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,333
to be scrambling.

385
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,458
And over someone like Toma
Kamijo, you know what I mean?

386
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,000
I get the feeling there
must be some information

387
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,583
that we're still unaware of.

388
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:29,833
[USHIBUKA]
In other words,

389
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,958
if we're serious about
protecting this guy...

390
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,541
Then yeah.

391
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,833
Chances are good we've still got
some investigating left to do.

392
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,666
[TATEMIYA]
The streets have been cleared.

393
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,375
How could I have
let this happen?

394
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,916
I'm pretty sure we've been had.

395
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,041
[KAMIJO]
I was wondering...

396
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,791
Where are the rest
of the Amakusa folks?

397
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,750
[ITSUWA] You may not be
able to see them right now,

398
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:55,916
but they're there.

399
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,083
Most likely watching
us from a distance.

400
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,416
It's too bad the priestess
couldn't be here.

401
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,708
It would be like having a
one-woman army on our side.

402
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,208
[KAMIJO] Oh, yeah? Kanzaki's
really that incredible?

403
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,666
[ITSUWA]
Of course she is!

404
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,583
She's one of not even twenty
saints in the whole world!

405
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,833
Any trouble you may have,

406
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,666
the priestess can
resolve instantly!

407
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,583
Oh, really? That's impressive.

408
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,166
Well, I guess she did
fight that archangel--

409
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,750
you know, the Power of God.

410
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,291
[ITSUWA]
She fought an archangel?!

411
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,000
[ITSUWA] I know that I'm not
supposed to let my guard down,

412
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,166
but I just...

413
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,458
[KAMIJO]
Itsuwa? Is something wrong?

414
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,541
No! Nothing!

415
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,791
I mean, everything's
fine, really!

416
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,916
I was just noticing that
there don't seem to be

417
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,541
very many people around.

418
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,666
And would you just look
at that beautiful view!

419
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,375
[KAMIJO]
Yeah, I know.

420
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,416
This is what Academy City
looks like at night.

421
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,041
It feels a whole
lot more deserted

422
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,916
than it should be, though.

423

[ACQUA]
I gave you a warning.

426
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,791
You had plenty of time
and a number of options

427
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:02,833
before you.

428
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,625
And yet, this is
the path you chose.

429
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,833
The one you decided it was
worth risking your life on.

It's Tatemiya's!

432
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,500
[ACQUA]
I truly want to know.

433
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,208

Our world is being disrupted.

438
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,208
I've come to eliminate the
source of the disturbance.

439
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,208
Is now the best time
for you to be concerned

440
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,875

has the ability to
challenge me and win

444

when your entire organization
combined could not?

I still have my pride.

Well, in that case,

00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,791
I'll have to give you
a little more insight

00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,125
thundering to the lower levels.

478
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,666
After everything is plucked
apart and strength is used up,

479
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,791
what sort of strike
does Itsuwa make?

480
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,500
Next time, "Saint Breakout."

481
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:10,416
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
