[KAMIJO] Academy City:
a city of science,

2
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,916
with a population
of 2.3 million.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,541
I'm Toma Kamijo,
a level zero student there,

4
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,291
which means I'm powerless.

5
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,916
At least, that's what they say.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,125
But I discovered I've
got a mysterious ability

7
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,750
in my right hand
that can cancel out

8
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,500
any other extraordinary powers.

9
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:56,083
And as a result of this gift,
happiness, divine favor,

10
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,875
and anything that
might actually be good

12

What is this,
some kind of penalty game?

Aren't we overstacking
the deck, here?

14
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,583
One day, a nun
fell from the sky

15
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,125
onto my doorstep.

16
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:12,166
Her name's Index, and she's
memorized 103 thousand books.

17
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,083
Shortly after that,
I was attacked

18
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,583
by a flame-producing sorcerer,

19
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,125
got chased around by
some lady with a katana,

20
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,458
and hung out with the
city's strongest esper,

21
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,000
who can manipulate vectors.

22
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,000
I was also dogged
by Mikoto Misaka,

23
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,875
a level five Zapper,

24
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:29,750
and then a bunch of girls
who looked just like her

25
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,500
surrounded me.

26

With all of the crisscrossing
between science and magic

It is pretty intense.

Not only is it more
elaborate then usual--

it's also quite ostentatious.

I find it interesting
that they've never asked

any of us in Judgement to
work security before today.

with those demonstrations.

itching for a chance like this.

I've got a question.

Considering that the October
midterms were cancelled...

Why are you still
spending all your free time

studying instead of relaxing?

I should ask you why
you're not still studying.

With midterms cancelled,
our entire grade

is going to be determined
by the final exam.

anything else but study.

Well, it's just that

a little nicer.

Whatever's causing this
unrest is really powerful.

That's right.

But what's happening
right now isn't a result

far deeper than that.

attention to the world

You have to put a stop
to all of that insanity.

That's the reason
I chose to contact you.

will learn I spoke to you.

to the 23rd School District.

481
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,333
From there, we'll have
to fly to France.

482
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,333
Our objective is a
Roman Orthodox magical item,

483
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,500
the Document of Constantine.

484
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,166
Also known as the Document of C.

485
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,208
That's gonna be the
key to resolving this case.

486
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,166
Ready, Kami? Here we go!

487
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,083
What? You mean right now?

488
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,666
[KAMIJO yelling]

489
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,333
[yelling continues]

490
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,666
[KAMIJO] After dropping
into a foreign city,

491
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,291
I'm reunited with Itsuwa.

492
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,458
Magical items? Geoducts?

493
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,125
Do you really even
need my right hand?

494
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,291
Next time,
"The Right Seat of God."

495
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,208
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
