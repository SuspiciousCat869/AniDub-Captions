Man, that is quite
the bombardment,

00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,166
but I'm concerned
about the area around it.

12
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,166
The palace is surrounded
by a large park,

should be a major problem.

about whether an attack

enough to bring down Carissa.

kill me, you'll have to notch

the bolt and draw back
the string first.

52
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,083
There's no point
in having a weapon

53
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,541
if you're too afraid to use it.

demonstrate for you!

Now that's what I call an
award-winning fine play!

Already battling the final boss.

I used them earlier for
a little live broadcast.

00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,750
But they were your allies!

67

They fought alongside you!
And you--

[CARISSA]
That's enough!

69
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,958
Why do you think
they're compensated

70
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,500
with status and riches?

71
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:04,958
It's because of their
willingness to do

72
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,291
whatever it takes to
protect their country.

73
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,291
Being expended for
the good of their kingdom

74
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,666
is a knight's lifelong dream.

75
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,833
And now as a result,
their firm solidarity

76
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,208
has been reborn.

If the coup d'etat
is unsuccessful,

both they and the country
will perish in terror!

like that would have

sliced you in half.

00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,875
Calling the destroyer,
Wimbledon, on patrol at Dover.

163
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,500
Prepare to launch a bunker
cluster cruise missile.

164
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,791
Your target: Buckingham Palace!

165
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,958
[KAMIJO]
A bunker cluster?

166
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,791
[CARISSA]
You ever seen one of those?

167
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,875
They can destroy everything
within a three-kilometer radius.

168
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,958
[KANZAKI]
We won't let that happen.

169
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:12,833
We'll place a defensive barrier
in the air to intercept it.

170
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,458
Ha! You're assuming
you'll be able to race

171
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,541
against a Mach Five
cruise missile?

172
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,541
[KANZAKI yells]

173
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:26,291
[CARISSA] So vulnerable,
just as I anticipated!

174
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,333
Kanzaki!

175
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,416
[RIMÉA]
My goodness.

176
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,125
The sorcerers of this nation
should have known better.

177
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,916
Underestimating the
head of state as she's

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,458
wielding Curtana Original
is quite an unfortunate mistake.

179
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,875
[VOICE 14A] Pardon me, miss,
but you were correct.

180
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,375
It's a tomb, all right.

181
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,416
Fit for the king of
an entire civilization.

182
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,916
I'll send you the material.

183
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,833
[RIMÉA]
Indeed.

184
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,583
Turns out there's
a rational explanation

185
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,000
as to why she hasn't
killed any of them.

186
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,125
I understand now why you're
rushing through life,

187
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,375
my sister, and I know
very well what you're after.

188
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,333
Hello? Do you read me?

189
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,916
Listen up. This is
First Princess Riméa.

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,750
As you know, Second Princess
Carissa has spun wildly

191
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,083
out of control.

192
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,000
But her actions have been
entirely for the sake

193
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,208
of Great Britain.

194
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,083
[RIMÉA] We have been under
pressure from the forces

195
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,250
of France, the Roman Orthodoxy,
and the Russian Church.

196
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,416
They have all used
the EU as their pawns

197
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,708
and violated our
national dignity.

198
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,250
Amidst such humiliation,

199
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,375
Carissa made the decision to
wield Curtana Original herself

200
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:47,041
in hopes that we would overcome
these external pressures.

201
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,708
However, she also
simultaneously resolved

202
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,833
to lock away such a
doomsday weapon forevermore,

203
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,791
so that it would
never be misused again.

204
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,291
Once the fighting was over,

205
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,708
she planned to take the
destroyed Curtana Original

206
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,250
and shards of Curtana Second
to a hole in the ground

207
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,875
destined to be her grave
and spend the rest of her life

208
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,750
there waiting to die.

209
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,208
Second Princess to
Destroyer Wimbledon.

210
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,666
Prepare to fire.

211
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,250
Launch another cluster.

212
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,083
[RIMÉA] To protect those
who might otherwise fight

213
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,500
alongside her,

214
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,083
she is acting as a tyrant
to justify a solo battle.

215
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,208
She is using the weapon
to wipe out all enemies

216
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,458
of our nation--
both foreign and domestic.

217
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,416
If there are any listening
who would take pity

218
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,083
on my sister--
some knight, perhaps,

219
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,833
who would like to
save this young woman--

220
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,750
Would you now please take
up your sword once again?

221
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,708
No matter what, I can't give up.

222
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,208
[laughing]

223
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,583
Is that a fact?

224
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,875
Well, the second
cluster is almost here.

225
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,458
So what will you do?

226
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,333
What an ignorant fool!

227
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,458
Our military will
blow you apart!

228
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:54,750
[KNIGHT LEADER]
Zero out!

229
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,750
It's you!

230
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,291
[KNIGHT LEADER] Once this coup
d'état is over, you're welcome

231
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,833
to take my head for my actions.

232
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,833
But first, we have to
ensure there's a future

233
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,416
where that can happen.

234
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,625
I'm requesting that the
members of this royal family

235
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,208
start working together

236
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,125
so that we may
properly confront France

237
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,583
and the Roman Orthodoxy.

238
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,791
Forgive me.

239
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,750
For leaving the
fate of my country

240
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,416
and the fate of the
princess in your hands.

241
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,916
It's fine.

242
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,708
Let's just work together
and end this thing.

243
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,125
How interesting.

244
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,000
It seems my sister
manipulated you

245
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,791
with her cunning performance.

246
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,833
[KNIGHT LEADER] If you're
wondering what motivated me

247
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:45,000
to save you, then yes,
that was a part of it.

248
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,500
That's unfortunate.

249
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,125
I suppose I'll just
have to use all of

250
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,916
the bunker clusters, then.

251
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,416
[KNIGHT LEADER] My Thororm spell
can't stand against Curtana.

252
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,875
It's not that strong,
but it's more than capable

253
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,833
of zeroing out the
attack of your remaining

254
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,666
bunker clusters.

255
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,541
You'd only be wasting them.

256
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,000
I've factored
that in, of course.

257
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,208
The Wimbledon has
twenty-four missiles,

258
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,583
the King Henry the
Seventh has twenty-six,

259
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,833
and the Sherwood has fifteen.

260
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,500
If I hide one of those
behind an illusion,

261
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,500
then your spell
would become useless

262
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,708
since you wouldn't be
able to identify a target.

263
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,500
Second Princess to all
destroyers who are on standby.

264
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,375
This is an order to launch
all of your cruise missiles!

265
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,125
Huh? An antenna?

266
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,291
[ACQUA] It might be difficult to
issue an order to the military.

267
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,500
I see.

268
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,916
You would dare to
interfere with my plans?

269
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,583
[KAMIJO]
Acqua!

270
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,208
I'm sorry if I'm late;
science isn't my forte.

271
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,416
I'm afraid destroying
all the military antennae

272
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,750
in the area took a bit
longer than I expected it to.

273
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,041
Who would have imagined that
one day the time would come

274
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,625
where you and I would be forced
to work together again?

275
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,250
It'll be fine as long as
you don't slow me down.

276
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,333
Right. Come, then.

277
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,333
Let's put our
skills to the test.

278

Show me what you've learned
over the past ten years!

279
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,041
I'll cut off your head!

at this game of hot potato.

Taking on three of you

290

is too much trouble.

291
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,791
Your mistake is
thinking "special people"

00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,500
are the only ones who
can accomplish anything.

293
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,666
The reason we can
harness such strength

294
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,208
is because there are
others here who support us.

Yes, perhaps.

296

But I wager you never
imagined that strength

297
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,708
might also be your weakness.

you should at least come
up with a better plan than mine.

Too bad. Your idea is
turning out rather terribly,

Oh, no, not at all.

at how small you're thinking.
