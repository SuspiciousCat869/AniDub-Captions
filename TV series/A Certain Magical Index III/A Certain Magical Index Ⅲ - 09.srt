You really are quite
something else.

your body is screaming

from all this high-speed
combat, isn't it?

[KANZAKI] The power of Gabriel
dwelt within Misha Kruezhev.

That incarnation seems
to have been incomplete.

But I'm sensing something
greater from Acqua.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,375

possess this much power?

to find Imagine Breaker.

Perhaps,

all the various levels,

What in the world was I doing?

I feel like I was putting
in grueling effort,

32

both of those saints,

But now I'm stranded because
of this low-oxygen alert.

And to top it all off,
the gate is malfunctioning,

to the ground level.

Why won't you just say it?

That you need my help!

Or that you need
help from someone!

Listen. I know all
about it, okay?

I know that you have amnesia.

00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,750
I get that you're carrying
the weight of something huge

61
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,291
inside of you.

62
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,833
But is it absolutely
necessary for you to carry it

63
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,541
all by yourself?

64
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,500
You look like you've been
through the wringer.

65
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,583
You even lost your memory.

66
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,500
So what reason could
you possibly have

67
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,083
to keep doing things alone?

68
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,541
I can fight too, you know.

I can be of help to you!

So say something.

Tell me where you're going

Whatever. Fine.

You're not listening
to me anyway.

I'll watch out for you
until you go back.

So. I guess you found
out about all that,

81
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,333
but you've got it wrong.

82
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,708
I can't remember
who I was before,

83
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,000
but apparently I wasn't the
kind of guy who was willing

84
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,875
to ask for help.

85
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,666
The me that I can't remember

86
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,250
is the one who is
driving who I am now.

He's still there.

88
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,750
Maybe not up here.
But here.

89
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,958
If I don't know,
he still understands.

90
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,875
He knows what I
want to accomplish

91
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,125
and what to do.

92
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,916
I'm sorry, Misaka.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,916
But you should hurry
up and get going.

94
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,083
When you think about
it, nothing's changed.

95
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,041
Even if my gears hadn't slipped
and I hadn't lost my memories,

96
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,375
I'd still be doing
the same thing.

97
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,333
I wouldn't be able to
leave it to someone else.

98
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,791
That's not Toma Kamijo.

99
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,708
He's not shaken by whether
or not he has his memories.

100
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,375
[MIKOTO] There's nothing
wrong with what I said.

101
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,708
He has to get back to
the hospital right away.

102
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,708
Even though I have the
option of going with him

103
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,083
and assisting with the fight.

104
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,083
Should I?

105
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,333
I mean, I believe what he said,

106
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,458
and there's probably
some special significance

107
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,541
for him in standing
on his own two feet.

108
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:20,000
So if that's the case, it
wouldn't be right to stop him.

109
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,291
The best thing I could do
is see him off from here.

Acqua's power is from

This shouldn't be possible.

It's beyond the realm of
potential and natural talent.

He must be using
some sort of trick.

Saintly powers and those
from the Right Seat of God

129

are incompatible.

But that's the nature
of the battlefield.

the Amakusa Church

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,500
where it needs to be!

162
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,208
[AMAKUSA CHURCH yells]

163
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,750
What's this?

164
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,041
You're seeking salvation
from the weak?

165
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,625
Is this how badly you
fear the fate of death?

166
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,916
Is that what it looks like?

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,791
It's true that I have
friends who were hurt

168
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:26,333
standing by my side, and I
feared it would happen again.

169
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,750
Because of that,

170
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,916
I decided to rethink my
involvement with the Amakusa.

171
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,416
But I was wrong.

172
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,583
This tragedy did not happen
because they were weaklings.

173
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,291
I labeled them as weak,

174
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,958
and I was unable to
trust in their abilities.

175
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,291
Somewhere inside me,
I looked down on them.

176
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,750
And I would never
allow them to protect me.

177
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,416
The real tragedy is my
arrogance in believing

178
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,250
that I was the one who
had to protect them.

179
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,666
And that's why I'm
going to overcome it.

180
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,791
I'll trust them to have my back.

181
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,750
And with all of us trusting
and supporting each other,

182
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,291
I will surmount this.

183
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,791
And the Amakusa Church will
have the revival it deserves!

184
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,208
[ACQUA] Your baseless hope
is simply a delusion.

185
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,708
What's wrong with you?

186
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,250
Did you truly think you could
surpass me by doing this?

187
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,666
[KANZAKI] Saints were born
with physical characteristics

188
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,000
very similar to the Son of God.

189
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,583
So they have a portion of
that power on loan to them.

190
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,375
[KANZAKI]
Be that as it may...

191
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,458
They cannot wield the kind
of power that you have.

192
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,583
You clearly have powers
above those of a simple saint.

193
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,000
And why is that?

194
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,708
The answer's obvious.

195
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,750
It's your Holy
Mother Veneration.

196
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,625
You have physical
characteristics not just similar

197
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,958
to the son of God, but to
the Holy Mother as well.

198
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,750
By stacking the attributes of
both saint and Holy Mother,

199
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,458
you've taken that power
that would normally

200
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,916
run out of control,

201
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,416
and found a way to
forcibly integrate it!

202
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,666
So what difference does
it make to you if I have?

203
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,875
It doesn't.

204
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,666
Because you have an
unfortunate weakness.

205
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,583
Compared to all the
other saints in the world,

206
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,250
you have an even greater
vulnerability to counter spells

207
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,166
that specifically target you!

208
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,041
She means Saint Breakout.

209
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,375
[KANZAKI]
Saint Breakout.

210
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,458
It forcibly collapses
the balance of traits

211
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,416
similar to the Son of God.

212
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,291
And this causes the power
to run rampant within them.

213
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,791
If you have both those traits

214
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,250
and are then hit with
a Saint Breaker spell...

215
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,000
He would detonate.

216
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,541
It makes sense.

217
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,000
That's why he was exclusively
using his magical abilities

218
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,125
defensively when
we fought earlier.

219
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,875
I see. So that's your play.

entire Amakusa Church.

It's not that I'm turning
it down for a better option.

254

Knights and mercenaries
are both important roles.
