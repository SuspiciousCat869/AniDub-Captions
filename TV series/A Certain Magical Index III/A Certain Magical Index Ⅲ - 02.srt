00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:41,333
[STIYL] Well, now, Biagio
Buzoni and Ms. Lorenzetti.

2
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,000
I suppose you already
know what we're going

3
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,208
to ask you about.

4
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:49,291
If you want a lesson from
the Church on the Bible,

5
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:52,416
you can bring any questions
you have to us on Sunday.

6
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,958
Just like everyone else.

7
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,666
[STIYL]
The tough act is pointless.

8
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,166
If necessary, we will use
whatever means we have

9
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,333
to extract the information
needed from inside your skulls.

10
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,041
Don't take Necessarius lightly.

11
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,875
[BIAGIO]
Hmm...?

12
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,083
Now, the Right Seat of God.

13
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,541
Tell us what you know.

14
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,333
If we do as you ask,
then I expect

15
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:19,125
you'll be willing to answer
some questions for us.

16
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,083
I want to know what
exactly is going on

17
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,750
outside these walls.

18
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,125
I'm sure you can
guess, can't you?

19
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:30,291
It's either what you're
thinking, or it's much worse.

20
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,833
"San Pietro, slips through
the evil clutches

21
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,625
of the emperor and sorcerer."

22
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,041
Oh, no!

23
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:46,750
Lidvia!

24
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,875
Are you ready to talk?

25
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,083
First, Oriana Thompson.

26
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,166
I request that you release her.

27
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,958
Allow the opportunity
to lead others

28
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,458
who have been caught up
in this unrest safely out of it

29
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,083
as is her will.

30
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,750
So that's it?

31
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,833
Even in your current
situation here,

32
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,708
you are still seeking
out relief for the weak.

33
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,291
Do you really feel
you're in any position

34
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,666
to make demands?

35
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,875
She can't be let go,
and wouldn't want to be.

36
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:17,625
She's in a temporary partnership
with the English Puritan Church.

37
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,958
The union has
a condition, and that is

38
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,250
for her leader to
protect the weak.

39
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,958
And aren't you her leader?

40
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,458
Even if you order
her to be released,

41
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:31,208
Oriana herself would
never agree to it.

42
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,458
You don't want her resolve
to be for nothing, do you?

43
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,583
If the unrest has been
created by the Roman Orthodoxy,

44
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,500
or rather,
the Right Seat of God,

45
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,500
then it would seem that
the key to resolving it

46
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,000
lies is in the act of
bringing them down.

47
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,250
Don't you agree?

48
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,333
[LIDVIA] Then tell me, what
is it that you want from us?

49
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,708
I believe our objective's
been made clear.

50
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,583
We wish to rescue the lost sheep

51
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,666
who have been swallowed
up by the overwhelming

52
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,916
power of magic.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,458
That's our goal now,
as it has always been.

54
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:10,541
I've never had the opportunity
to meet any of them personally,

55
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,875
and I have only heard bits
and pieces of information

56
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,291
about them on occasion.

57
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,041
From that, I can say...

58
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,875
The Right Seat of God is...

59
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,250

[KAMIJO coughing]

64
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,958
[ITSUWA]
Um... Are you okay?

65
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,625
[KAMIJO]
Yeah. Great.

66
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,875
Hey, you're with the Amakusa.

67
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,833
Itsuwa, right?

68
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,916
Yeah. That's me.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,375
It's been a long time.

70
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:47,125
Yeah. Did Tsuchimikado
ask you to come here?

71
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,583
Where did he go?

72
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,875
Huh?

73
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,916
[KAMIJO] We're tracking
down the Document of C.

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,541
Supposedly it's being
used to instigate

75
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,041
the demonstrations that
have been popping up.

76
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,000
What?! How do you
know about that?

77
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,250
Who told you?

78
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,458
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Listen close, Kami.

79
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,916
I'm gonna tell you all
about this Document of C.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,333
Originally, it was sort
of like a deed, y'know?

81
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,041
Something that shows
who controls what land.

82
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,708
It said the land rights to
territories formerly ruled

83
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:19,833
by Constantine had been
given over to the Roman pope.

84
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,166
A fun fact...

85
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,083
When you read the Document
of C, its seal emerges.

86
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,958
Which is said to be
proof that the land

87
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,708
belongs to the Papacy.

88
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:28,791
Make sense?

89
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,166
Good. Now, when we're talking
about it as a magical item,

90
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,916
it's got even crazier powers.
Check this out.

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,833
Everything that the
Roman pope declares

92
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,458
instantly becomes
"accurate information"--

93
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,083
it's seen as a fact
no matter what it is.

94
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,000
Insane, right?

95
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,958
So if the pope
declares something,

96
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,041
even if there's no basis for it,

97
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,000
for followers of Roman Orthodoxy

98
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,583
that declaration ends
up being correct.

99
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,541
'Kay. So what's the catch?

100
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,458
I was just about to get to that.

101
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,750
There is a catch.

102
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,875
And it's a pretty important one.

103
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,583
It has to be set up
in the Vatican

104
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,083
for it to work at all.

105
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,416
Also, it's not like it
alters the laws of physics

106
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,625
or anything.

107
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,458
It can only make people
believe what's said.

108
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,083
[KAMIJO] And that's
everything I was told.

109
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,625
The document is still
within the church.

110
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,041
They're trying to use
it against Academy City.

111
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,625
In an effort to make
everyone believe

112
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,166
we're the bad guys.

113
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,708
And that's what's causing
the demonstrations?

114
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,541
Possibly.

115
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:31,000
I assumed someone would've
let you guys know about it.

116
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,458
No.

117
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,041
We received a request from
the English Puritan Church.

118
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,958
To survey the magical
value of the geoducts here.

119
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,916
All over France,
that's what I was doing.

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,791

00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,791
[ITSUWA]
Yes.

123
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,666
We're in the city
of Avignon right now,

124
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,791

Huh.

But if the Document of C
can only be used

127
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,583
in the Vatican, then...

128

Um...

you mind if I go get my bag?

130

it up on the bridge earlier.

Hold on.

there to save me?

Well, good thing.

Uh-huh.

00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,875
[KAMIJO] So, why Avignon
and not the Vatican?

179
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,250
[ITSUWA] Are you familiar
with an incident that happened

180
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:20,083
in the late thirteenth century,
known as the Avignon Papacy?

181
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,416
[ITSUWA] There was a
dispute between France

182
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,458
and the Roman Orthodoxy,
and when the king of France won,

183
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,416
he decided to incarcerate
the Roman pope

184
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,625
here in Avignon.

185
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:38,125
And then, for the next
sixty-eight years,

186
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,916
the functions of the
Holy Roman See

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,083
were moved to the
Papal Palace in Avignon.

188
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,041
[ITSUWA]
However...

Hey.

199
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,833
Can the pope's work
be done anywhere?

200
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,125
Or is it something that
specifically has to be done

201
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,416
at the Vatican?

202
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,875
It depends.

203
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,583
There are plenty of things
he wouldn't be able

204
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,750
to do away from home.

205
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:31,333
Like, say, for example,
using magical items.

206
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,333
Specifically, those that
are within the Papal domain.

207
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,083
The Church's solution
was to establish

208
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,125
an enchanted pipeline using
geoducts between the Vatican

209
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,708
and Avignon, making it
possible to control

210
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,791
the facilities within
the Papal domain remotely.

211
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,666
So you're saying...

212
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,333
They'll be able to
use the magical items

213
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,250
here in Avignon now?

214
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,583
[ITSUWA]
Exactly.

215
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,791
But why?

216
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,166
Seems like a
roundabout way to go.

217
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,208
Wouldn't it be easier to just
use them in the Vatican?

218
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,750
[ITSUWA] Well... there are
some particular arrangements

219
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,125
that are required in
order to use them there.

220
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,291
Doing it this way,
he can ignore or abridge

221
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,083
some of those and use
the items at his discretion.

222
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,791
But the trade-off is that it
seems to take a long time

223
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,500
to activate the pipeline.

224
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,458
So we may still
be able to stop them

225

from using the Document of C.

to that of the angels.

00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,791
I knew it.

318
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,208
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
How?

319
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,250
I don't remember ever explaining
that part of it to you.

320
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,708
Itsuwa from the Amakusa told me.

321
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,791
We're trying to get there
but the rioting is too severe.

322
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,500
Is this also because of
the Document of C's power?

323
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,791
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Bingo! Well deduced, my friend!

324
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,291
Which means you
can wait if you want,

325
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,375
but the situation won't improve.

326
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,250
Isn't there anything
else we can do?

327
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,291
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Sure!

328
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,500
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Here's a question.

329
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,625
Do you know why the
Papal Palace of Avignon

330
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,000
is viewed as so important?

331
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,666
Because it allows them
to control facilities

332
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,875
in the Vatican?

333
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:45,958
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Bingo!

334
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,708
That's it! The geoduct pipeline!

335
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,250
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Double bingo!

336
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,666
If we could manage
to sever the geoduct

337
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,166
that connects Avignon
with the Vatican...

338
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,666
Right! Even if it's too hard for
us to reach the Papal Palace,

339
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,541
maybe we can at least
get close enough

340
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,041
to the pipeline on the way.

341
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:07,208
And then all I have to do is
wreck it with my right hand.

342
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,750
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Yeah, I'm
gonna suggest avoiding that.

343
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:14,208
But geoducts are magic,
and my hand destroys magic.

344
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,125
So why--

345
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,625
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Thing is...

346
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,541
It's hard to identify what
exactly that hand of yours does.

347
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,041
Sure, it's supposed to cancel
out supernatural powers

348
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,416
and what-not, but...

349
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,541
What if there are exceptions?

350
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,958
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Itsuwa, was it?

351
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,958
What do you know about
demolishing pipelines?

352
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,458
Uh, lots!

353
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,041
If the Amakusa way of
doing things will work.

354
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,250
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Sure, why not?

355
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,000
Then I'll leave the
hunt for the pipeline

356
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,625
in your capable hands.

357
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,958
I gotta make my move now.

358
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,000
Later!

359
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,625
[KAMIJO]
This is a museum?

360
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,375
Yes, but I'm guessing
all the rioting

361
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,708
must've spooked them
into closing early.

362
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,708
It'd be great if we
could poke around.

363
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:14,916
But how?

364
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,708
We gotta make this fast.

365
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,000
Okay...

366
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,708
Hey!

367
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,916
[ITSUWA]
Looks like this is the place!

368
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,291
This power resembles
Roman Orthodox style.

369
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:46,125
And this duct is for Western
church-of-the-cross societies.

370
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,458
[KAMIJO] It doesn't look
like anything to me.

371
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,916
It's fairly cleverly concealed,
so it's difficult to do.

372
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,666
Let's get moving before the
enemy realizes we're here.

373
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,291
Is that a hairdryer?

374
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,166
Do the Amakusa
use household items

375
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,791
to build their spells?

376
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:07,166
[ITSUWA] Yes. The Pamphlet,
mineral water, and white--

377
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,041
[gasps]

378
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,458
[KAMIJO]
What's the matter?

379
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,333
[ITSUWA]
I'm so sorry.

380
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,250
I know it's awkward,
but they're required

381
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,583
for the framework of the spell.

382
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,958
[KAMIJO chuckles]

383
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,291
[ITSUWA] It's impossible to
destroy the geoduct completely.

384
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,916
But I can at least make
the pipeline unusable.

385
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:31,666
[ITSUWA]
Here we go.

386
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,583
Get out of the way!

387
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:50,541
Itsuwa!

388
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,333
No, don't! Stay back!

389
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,666
[ITSUWA]
Get outside! Quickly!

390
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,500
[TERRA]
Well, well.

391
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,000
I suppose accuracy
really does drop

392
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,375
when something's launched
from greater distances.

393
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,791
That's magic.

394
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,166
Roman Orthodox?

395
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,500
[TERRA]
I'm not saying you're wrong,

396
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,583
but if you must assign a label,

397
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,375
I would prefer that
you address me

398
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,125
as the Right Seat of God.

399
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,166
My name is Terra of the Left.

400
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,375
Nice to meet you.

401
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,166
It looks like my time
has finally arrived.

402
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,666
It's been difficult.

403
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,916
See, we do not have
the ability to use

404
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,458
the common sort of magic
that humans prefer.

405
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,291
And enacting the Document of C

406
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,666
must be left to
other spellcasters.

407
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,500
So I hope you'll consider
spending a little time

408
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,250
with me today.

409
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:51,375
I've been so bored lately.
I could use some entertainment.

410
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,041
--[KAMIJO grunts]
--[ITSUWA gasps]

411
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,083
That was some powerful force,
but with my right hand...

412
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,625
Well that was a twist.

413
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,250
Ordinarily that attack
would have killed you.

414
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:08,166
So that's Imagine Breaker,
right? How fun.

415
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,333
I heard that you tormented
Vento of the Front.

416
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,416
You ready?

417
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,541
[KAMIJO yelling]

418
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,791
I apologize for what comes next.

419
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,541
[ITSUWA]
Seven Teachings!

420
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:24,875
Seven Blades!

421
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,166
Precedence.

422
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,208
[laughs]

423
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,000
[TERRA] Precedence. Outer wall
lower, physical body higher.

424
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:44,041
[TERRA] Precedence. Outer wall
lower, blade motion higher!

425
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,083
[KAMIJO]
Move!

426
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,125
[ITSUWA grunts]

427
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:54,791
[KAMIJO grunts]

428
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,916
I'd heard many a tale of the
Imagine Breaker beforehand,

429
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,875
so I admit, I did have some
expectations coming into this.

430
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,250
But honestly, I'm disappointed.

431
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,541
You must've caught
Vento on a bad day.

432
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,041
Because I can't see how anybody

433
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,916
would have
trouble defeating you.

434
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,458
[KAMIJO]
He's powerful.

435
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,833
So this is the
Right Seat of God.

436
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,500
[KAMIJO]
Unrest breeds more unrest,

437
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,166
and the city is enveloped
in the flames of science.

438
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,208
What secret will Terra
reveal about my right hand?

439
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:07,041
Next time, "The Document of C."

440
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,916
When Science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
