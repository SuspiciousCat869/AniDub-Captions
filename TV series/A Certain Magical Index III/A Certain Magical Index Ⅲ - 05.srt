I managed to use my
Spear of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli.

That's not useless.

How nice for you. That reminds
me of an expression I know.

"A miss is as good as a mile."

not after all of this.

All right.
How 'bout a question?

Do you know where BLOCK
is currently heading?

170
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,333
Yeah.

171
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,041
They're going to a juvie hall
in the tenth school district.

172
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,375
Why would you even consider
attacking a place like that?

173
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,583
It wasn't about
the place, exactly.

174
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,875
Our target was Move Point.

175
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,500
We were investigating.

176
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,666
And we received intelligence
that some of her friends

177
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,250
were being held there.

178
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,875
We figured we'd capture them,

179
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,916
and then use them to
negotiate with Move Point.

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,166
To get into the
building without windows.

[MERCENARY 05A]
Yes.

182

BLOCK figured out that Move
Point was the secret guide.

183
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,333
Since it can't be
destroyed from the outside,

184
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,041
we were assigned to learn
how supplies were delivered,

185
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,708
and use that information
to blow the building

186
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,791
up from the inside using
synchronous composite bombs.

Yep, sure do.

that you can't use them.

could spin out of control.

I wondered why it was
so quiet around here.

She's an Aztecan sorceress

I know I certainly
learned a lot.

controlled every corner

of this world, but he doesn't.

257

It turns out there's a way to
get out from under his thumb

That particular weapon
doesn't suit you.

as you're ready to share

the service route for the

Tell me.

What's got you so
angry with Aleister

328
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,708
you'd be willing to go this far?

Like so many others,

330

I've experienced serious
tragedy in this city,

331
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,125
and I deserve to find out
if he was involved in it.

332
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,708
I want answers. That's all.

333

Trust me, I know what
it's like to be fixated

on finding out the
truth about something.

335

But... Nothing he'd say
would provide peace of mind.

336
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,541
You would be suspicious
of any answer he gave you.

337
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:49,750
Is that so?

338
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,333
Then how do you find peace?

339
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,125
[MUSUJIME] The trauma
I've sustained is keeping me

340
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,208
from transporting myself,

341
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,625

fight hand to hand either.

[MUSUJIME]
Right.

343
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,291
It's because this is
my constant mindset.

344

If I don't change it, I'll never
be able to protect anyone.

Yeah, and I hope you're ready,

I know it's unfortunate.

But this is the
kind of leadership

that's expected
of me these days.

Xochitl. What in the world?

If you ever try to compensate
for lack of abilities

358
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,333
with a grimoire,

359
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,833
this is the kind of
thing that can happen.

360
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,333
You could learn from me.

361
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,916
What? You mean you read one?

[XOCHITL]
No. It's worse than that.

What are you saying?

364
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,458
That you've fused with
the original grimoire text?

365
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,208
You tried to gain more power
by making it a part of you?

366
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,208
Any spell that distorts
your own body will fail!

367
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,375
You had to have known that much!

368
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,583
Sure, but it doesn't matter
as long as I'm still able

369
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,541
to kill you while
it's consuming me.

370
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,875
If I do it before I die,

371
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,375
then the organization's
goal is achieved.

The organization that I knew
was already terrible enough.

But what the hell's been
happening while I've been away?

You won't die. I won't let you.

375
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,250
The original text will
display its knowledge

to anyone who desires it.

377
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,166
I'll have to visualize
it consuming me.

378
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,708
And that should allow me to
draw it completely out of her.

379

Of course there's no precedent,
so if I fail, it'll kill me.
