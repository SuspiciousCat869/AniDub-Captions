the skies turn pitch-black,

318
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,208
and strange objects rise.

319
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,416
The light of
destruction descends.

320
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,583
Next time,
"The Star of Bethlehem."

321
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,458
When science and magic cross
paths, a story is born.
