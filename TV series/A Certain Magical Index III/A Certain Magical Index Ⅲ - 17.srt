Apparently, the rabbit

What the hell did you just do?

And what have you
done to Tochtli?

Rabbit bones, remember?

Perhaps it might make more

00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,250
I'd love to take a page from
their exceptional methods

and duplicate them,
but I cannot.

We call that a third-stringer.

Even though you've got
modest skills of your own,

49
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:22,875
all you know how to do is
follow that old man's orders.

50
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,625
A dude like you
claims to be the heir

of those who fought
in the name of justice.

You saying that bastard
Shiokishi seems like

a good guy to you?

54
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,791
And now, for some reason,

55
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,000
you think you're in the
right for following him?

Are you trying to make me laugh?

57
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,208
It's true, the word "good"
always ends up

58
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:42,208
being exploited by those
in power somehow.

59
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,375
Although, if your default is
to relegate everything to evil,

60
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,083
is that really going
to solve every last one

61
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,333
of the world's problems?
From my perspective,

62

the only thing
your brand of evil does

63
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,583
is scavenge the scraps that drop
down from the table of good.

64

You scumbag, the moment
you call any good deed

65
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,708
"table scraps" makes it
obvious nothing good you do

66
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:00,958
is genuine.

You're telling me
I'm not genuine?

By the way, your electrode
has been modified

controlled remotely when needed.

your fighting strength
drops to zero.

ultra-familiar with fighting

to determine our weaknesses.

87
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,291
On the other hand,
you didn't seem to understand

88
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,208
that I am also a person
who has had to fight

I am virtually unbeatable
in close-quarters combat.

So the most dangerous
thing I could ultra-face

If you're going to use
this as a weapon,

It has the ability to affect
the Misaka Network.

The last word anyone would
ever use to describe me

is "good."

been to attack you

Toma Kamijo and Accelerator

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,333
are two of the irregular
factors that fall within

162
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,500
the tolerance levels
of this plan.

163
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,000
That's why they can be
situated at the center

164
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,000
and be used as much as
needed to make it succeed.

165
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:54,083
On the other hand, it's not the
same for your friend Hamazura.

166
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,250
He appears to be a bit
of a hindrance.

167
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,708
He was supposed
to have been killed

168
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,708
during the conflict among
our dark subgroups.

169
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,250
Shiage Hamazura is a
Level Zero without any power.

170
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,750
He has no definite role to play,

171
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,166
so he's trying to achieve
something all on his own--

172
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,291
perhaps he seeks
a new kind of value.

173
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,916
Not even Aleister
knows what to expect.

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,416
But depending on
what it turns out to be,

175
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,166
it may or may not have
the potential to damage

176
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,750
Aleister's plan.

177
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,500
Therefore, Academy City
is marshalling

178
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,000
all of its forces
to kill Hamazura

179
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,708
before he causes
any destruction.

180
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,041
What do you think?
Is he worth the trouble?

181
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,208
[SHIOKISHI]
DRAGON? [grunts]

182
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,291
I'm sure you all have
your own suppositions.

183
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,416
Oh, come on, you're not
gonna try and tell us

184
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
you know nothing
about it, are you?

185
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,125
Believe me, it would be
easier to say I didn't.

186
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,833
But unfortunately, I did
learn a few things.

187
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,750
It's something nobody
should ever be forced

188
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,333
to lay their eyes upon.

189
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,416
We get that.
Just tell us what it is.

190
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,666
Where is DRAGON,
and what is it exactly?

191
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,291
You don't get it, do you?

192
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,625
DRAGON can be found everywhere.

193
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,958
Look.

194
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,500
Turn around and you'll see
DRAGON behind you now.

195
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,833
What? Hey!

196
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,000
[thud]

197
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,833
[VOICE]
DRAGON?

198
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,458
The name isn't exactly wrong,

199
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,916
but to be the most accurate,
"Angel" would also apply.

200
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,916
However, if you want
to be more precise

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,291
when addressing me directly,
it would be prudent

202
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,083
to use the following
name instead.

203
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,833
The name that
belongs to the being

204
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,958
who once gave an eccentric
sorcerer, Aleister Crowley,

205
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,916
the necessary knowledge
in the necessary amount.

206
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,666
"Aiwass."

207
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,250
[HAMAZURA, TAKITSUBO panting]

208
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,166
Hold on!

209
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,166
Run.

210
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,791
Hamazura, please.

211
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,416
It's the only way now.

212
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,916
[HAMAZURA]
Huh?

213
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,166
[TAKITSUBO] If we continue
like this, we'll both be caught,

214
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,875
so just go.

215
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,291
[TAKITSUBO]
Hamazura.

216
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,375
[HAMAZURA]
Be quiet.

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,125
Someone's coming.

218
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,666
I hear something.

219
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,750
[gasps]

220
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,125
Everything will be fine.
Please go.

221
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,375
At least this way I can
buy you some time.

222
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,875
You can't be serious!

223
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,333
[rumbling]

224
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,083
[HAMAZURA]
Please, somebody please find us.

225
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,541
Some kind of hero.

226
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,833
Just show up out of
nowhere and save her life.

227
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:58,916
Please!

228
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,541
Hey, looks like we made it!

229
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,875
I have no idea who
stepped in to help us,

230
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,541
but we survived this!

231
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,916
[laughing]

232
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,375
[MUGINO]
Hamazura.

233
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:28,041
[footsteps]

234
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,250
It can't be...

235
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,458
[MUGINO] Don't you dare let
these two-bit bastards

236
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,250
come in here and take your life.

237
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,458
That would be so unfair,
don't you think?

238
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,375
Besides, I've already decided
that I deserve the honor

239
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,250
of tearing you limb from limb!

240
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,791
[AIWASS]
Why do you look so mystified?

241
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,541
I don't believe my
sudden appearance

242
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,666
could really be that
incomprehensible to you.

243
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,958
It would help if you
tell me what you are

244
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,666
and why the hell you
would wrap yourself up

245
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,708
in a codename like "DRAGON." 

246
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,625
[AIWASS] This is where I'm
going to have to attempt

247
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,583
an explanation, isn't it?

248
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,250
My identity is not
that big of a deal.

249
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:12,083
I'm an insignificant being
and nothing more.

250
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,500
Huh?

251
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,958
[AIWASS]
Oh, dear.

252
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,500
It appears I'm not able to
express that great a degree

253
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,458
of meaning in this world.

254
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,416
Are you perhaps
familiar with the phrase

255
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,166
"Fuse= KAZAKIRI?" 

256
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,166
[ACCELERATOR]
Huh?

257
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,833
[AIWASS sighs]

258
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:29,708
Well, it is a being that is
known as an artificial angel.

259
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:33,625
A mass of AIM dispersion fields.

260
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,916
It is also something
of a production line

261
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,791
used to give me
this form as Aiwass.

262
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:43,041
Just appearing for the
fun of it is fine and all,

263
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,083
but now what do I do?

264
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,166
What would you like to do?

265
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,833
Would you like to upset
Aleister's aspirations

266
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,083
based on the information
only I can give you?

267
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,666
Why do I feel like you're
just jerking my chain?

268
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,916
[AIWASS]
I don't know.

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,625
I will not be the
one who is upset

270
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,916
if Aleister's plan is derailed.

271
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,875
Whether it takes
ten thousand years,

272
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,541
or even one hundred thousand.

273
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,875
I'll just wait for another
opportunity to manifest.

274
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,666
Pardon me, "emerge." 

275
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,583
Oh, and just so you know.

276
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,958
The plan that Aleister
is undertaking?

277
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,333
It's already starting
to come apart.

278
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,916
Meaning...?

279
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,125
[AIWASS] Meaning the fractures
are slowly starting to widen.

280
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,291
And if it keeps up,
the keystone of his plan,

281
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:29,416
Last Order, is certain to
disintegrate sooner or later.

282
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,916
[ACCELERATOR]
How dare you!

283
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,541
I don't care if you are a
mass of AIM dispersion fields

284
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,000
or some kind of dragon-angel
or whatever.

285
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,416
If you maliciously intend
to do harm to that kid,

286
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,791
I promise I will
show you no mercy!

287
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,250
[coughing, grunting]

288
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,541
[AIWASS]
Oh, no.

289
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,791
That was my mistake, I'm afraid.

290
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:02,916
Aleister, you messed with that
structural virus, didn't you?

291
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,625
What a pity.

292
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,458
Goodness, I'm so sorry.

293
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,166
If you want to kill me,

294
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,541
you will first have to deal
with these glowing wings

295
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,458
before you have
a hope of success.

296
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,375
[ACCELERATOR] I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!

297
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,791
[AIWASS] Let's see,
"Do what thou wilt,

298
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,875
shall be the whole
of the Law."

299
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,250
Is that right?

300
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,666
[ACCELERATOR yells]

301
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,750
[AIWASS]
Is that all you have left?

302
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,333
I tried to draw you out
by explicitly mentioning

303
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,125
Last Order, but alas.

304
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,083
[ACCELERATOR]
I get it now.

305
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,625
What was it you said?

306
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,708
You appear by using
AIM diffusion fields,

307
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:54,875
isn't that right?

308
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,083
And the only way you
were able to control them

309
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,416
is by having that kid become
infected with the virus

310
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,750
so you could create
that Fuse=KAZAKIRI crap.

311
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,666
I'm right, aren't I?

312
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,250
Then if that's the case...

313
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,250
[AIWASS]
Now you're using your head.

314
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,041
Looks like you've also
reset it to work on

315
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,500
the entire Misaka Network.

316
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,291
But do you realize
that in doing so,

317
