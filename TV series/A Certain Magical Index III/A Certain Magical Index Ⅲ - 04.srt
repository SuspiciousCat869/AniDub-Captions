Well, they probably
hired a new one.

196
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,666
And I guess that means they also
decided ignoring our warning

She has like,

There're so many
levels of "gross,"

213
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,583
it's hard to be specific.

What do you think
will happen after a VIP

228

229

Outside personnel are called in

to cover the
treatment facilities.

231

They'll round up all the
specialized researchers.

Then materials, machinery,
and anything else they need.

That could throw security
arrangements off completely.

[MUGINO] That's exactly
what SCHOOL was counting on.

They want to use this
chaos to their advantage.

That's why they targeted

a baby, or a stroller?

320
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,625
Die, you idiot.

321
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,416
[KAKINE] Laying all of this
groundwork was a real pain.

322
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,416
But I have the nanoparticle
object interference

323
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,708
adsorption manipulator
to show for it.

324
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,416
Better known as "the tweezers." 

325
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,958
This breakthrough will
lead me to Aleister.

326
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,208
Kakine!

327
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,541
[TSUCHIMIKADO] It appears
that someone has hacked into

328
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:04,166
the fifth School District
Computer Virus Archive Center.

329
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,416
In addition to storing
many unanalyzed viruses,

330
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,083
they also house multiple
experimental ones,

331
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:14,000
deliberately created by Academy
City's research institutes.

332
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,375
Those would be bad enough here,
but if they made it outside--

333
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,833
Well, their infrastructure
will collapse.

334
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:20,916
So we're clear,

335
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,250
just how far
outside is "outside?"

336
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,458
Huh. Know what I heard
about Academy City security?

337
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,375
That their safeguarding
priorities are inside-outward,

338
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,416
not outside-inward as
some might be assuming.

339
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,958
If so, then they should be more
than well-equipped for this.

340
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,000
An externally-connected
terminal?

[DRIVER 04B]
Commencing emergency shutdown

342

of externally-connected

343
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,375
Third School District north
terminal is shut down.

344
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,750
Second School District
south terminal is shut down.

345
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,791
What is it?

346
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,291
[DRIVER 04B] The Thirteenth
School District's west terminal

347
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,458
isn't responding.
I can't confirm a shutdown.

348
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,666
[ACCELERATOR laughs]

349
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,958
Could their schemes
be any more transparent?

350
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,750
You're right, I'd say
odds are pretty good

351
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,791
they're trying to lure us there.

352
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,083
I don't know who these guys are,

353
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,791
but it seems like they're
begging for a fight

354
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,791
they won't win.

355
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,583
[DRIVER 04B] What should
we do about Monaka Oyafune's

357
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,166
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
We'll come back to that later.

358
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,291
[DRIVER 04B] All right,
what about Mr. Unabara?

359
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,375
I was never really
planning to rescue him.

360

[phone ringing]

361
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,833
[YAMATE (UNABARA)]
It's Unabara.

362
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,458
Who are you out goofing
around with now? SCHOOL?

363
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,500
Well, no. It's BLOCK.

364
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,500
I'm sure you've figured it out,
but BLOCK's hacking satellites.

365
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,666
It's not SCHOOL.

366
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,291
However, it's a diversion.

367
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,583
What they're really after
is the aerospace engineering

368
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:42,041
research institute's auxiliary
satellite control center.

369
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,791
I'll let you deal with that.

370
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,041
Talk to you later.

371
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,666
They want the
satellite control center.

372
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,666
Makes sense.

373
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,375
I can see why.

374
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,875
The Hikoboshi II satellite
is fully equipped

375
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:59,500
with a high-caliber
surface-attack laser.

376
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,750
But that doesn't mean
we disregard the virus leak

377
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:02,791
at the storage center.

Uh... Who are you?

Take me to the

[CITIZEN 04A]
Yes, sir.

386
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,666
[KAMIJO] Those struggling
to escape control.

387
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,541
Those who voluntarily
leap into the framework.

Their motives cross,
provoking a new battle.
