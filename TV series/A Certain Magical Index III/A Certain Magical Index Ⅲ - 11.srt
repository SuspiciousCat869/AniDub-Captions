This was an act of subversion

This isn't a quarrel

presently, Britain
is being isolated.

[ELIZARD] We enlisted
Necessarius's help

162
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,708
to create an illusion spell.

163
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,500
We later found
traces of something

164
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,916
that had caused it
to jam and fail.

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,291
What troubles me most
is that evidence shows

166
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,458
the source of this jamming
came from Scotland,

167
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,291
right here in
the United Kingdom.

168
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,875
So we have more than
just our outside enemies.

169
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,541
As if it wasn't
enough of a headache

170
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,500
dealing with Britain and
France squabbling as they are.

171
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,333
Now you're saying we have
independent terrorists

172
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,000
inside the country, too? Blast.

173
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,750
The identity of the
terrorists has been revealed.

174
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,166
Their organization's
name is "New Light."

175
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,208
It's comprised of four members.

176
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,666
They also appear to have just
completed an archeological dig.

177
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,875
I wonder if they mean to
bring whatever they dug up

178
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,541
back to London in
order to carry on

179
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,000
with some sort of
subversive activity.

180
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,041
If so, there are two things
we must do immediately.

181
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,541
First, deal with the
external threat from France

182
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,916
by determining the true cause
of the Eurotunnel blast.

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,083
Then determine affiliation
of the sorcerer

184
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,458
who is the internal threat

185
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,750
so that they can be
eliminated if necessary.

186
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,625
Heading up the
Eurotunnel investigation

187
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,875
for our external threat
will be the knights.

188
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,500
The Puritans will take
the lead in scrutinizing

189
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,916
British sorcerer societies
in order to find

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,833
the internal threat.

191
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,666
However, the List
of Prohibited Books

192
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,250
will be acting
separately to help

193
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,875
with the investigation here.

194
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,041
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

195
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,291
Um... May I ask what
I'm supposed to do?

196
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,750
There you go again!

197
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,583
You have this terrible habit
of wanting to be involved

198
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,541
in every incident
that comes along!

199
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,750
[CARISSA]
Really? I don't see why not.

200
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,541
Necessarius appears to be
pretty shorthanded these days.

201
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,125
I disagree.

202
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,875
I don't think it's advisable to
expose civilians to such danger.

203
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,583
Yes, I see your point.

204
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,750
There's no need to force
civilians to help us.

205
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:55,250
He should stay back until
the situation is resolved.

206
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:59,791
Lucky me! I can just sit here
and relax until you're done.

207
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,750
Now then. Should anyone not
serving the national interest

208
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,666
run up a bill during
their stay here,

209
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,750
we will request payment
for those expenses

210
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,291
at a later date.
You don't mind, do you?

211
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,791
[ELIZARD] I must say, it's quite
the bargain when you think of it

212
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,875
as having two or three
suites to yourself

213
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,916
at a gaudy five-star hotel.

214
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,666
It would be my honor to
work alongside all of you

215
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,250
for the sake of British peace.

216
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:29,541
[BAYLOUPE] Tell me, does it
feel like the game is on yet?

217
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,791
Lancis, you are our goalkeeper.

218
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,000
[LANCIS giggles]
I'm ready for it!

219
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,541
This magic is tickling me!

220
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,708
[FLORIS] Whatever, our half
will strike hard and fast.

221
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,166
We'll get this done quickly.

222
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,875
[BAYLOUPE]
Hey, Lessar,

223
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,208
You haven't forgotten that
you're a part of that half,

224
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,500
have you?

225
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,708
If you screw this up,
you'll answer to me.

226
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,375
I'm not going to.

227
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,750
But since we're
picking positions,

228
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,875
I'd like to be a forward.

229
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,541
[LANCIS] Are you finished
getting the Skidbladnirs ready?

230
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,333
After all it took
to dig that up,

231
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,333
we need to be careful
with its container, too.

232
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,208
[LESSAR]
Yes, I understand.

233
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,208
We're transforming
Britain today, aren't we?

234
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,125
Big day for "New Light" members!

235
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,541
[KAMIJO] You know, I never
thought I'd run into you.

236
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,500
Well, a lot has happened
since we last spoke.

237
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,000
Let's just say I
made a little deal.

238
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,625
And now, I'm using my skills
for Britain instead, you see?

239
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:26,791
[KAMIJO yelps]

240
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,333
All right. Now I just carry
the suitcase into position,

241
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,333
and then wait
here for the signal.

242
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,208
What the--?

243
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,541
Uh... This is my suitcase.

244
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,666
I think yours is
the one down here.

245
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,041
Uh... Oh, so sorry, miss.

246
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,708
[LESSAR]
That was close.

247
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,791
Wait. Which one is that?

248
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,208
[LESSAR gasps]
Everybody freeze, now!

249
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,041
[KAMIJO yells]

250
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,166
[ORIANA] Sounds to me like
one of them just screwed up.

251
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,625
[KAMIJO]
What's going on there?

252
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,208
[ORIANA] An obvious
explosion of suspiciousness.

253
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,333
[LESSAR]
Let's see, which one is it?

254
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,333
This one?

255
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,875
No, this one!

256
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,000
First, we clear the area.

257
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,333
And then, we handle
the other thing.

258
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,000
[KAMIJO gasps]

259
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,041
Kinda overdoing it, aren't you?

260
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,791
[ORIANA] On the contrary,
this could be bad.

261
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,583
Hey, wait!

262
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,500
[LESSAR]
You don't mind, do you?

You're kidding me, right?

[LESSAR yells]
Why'd I do that?

269
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,750
I hid behind the
most important thing!

270
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,125
[KAMIJO]
Hey, Oriana.

271
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,000
I get the feeling that
we should be going after

272
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,375
that rectangular case.

273
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,625
I think you're right.

274
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,875
And if it also happens
to be a magical item,

275
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,666
wouldn't it be interesting
if you were to punch it

276

with your right hand?

00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,625
Yeah, that's a good call!

00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,666
I can't afford to
be outdone right now!

[glass breaks]

[KAMIJO]
Damn it.

281
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,958
How are we s'posed
to follow that?

282
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,625
Easy. We don't.

[BAYLOUPE]
Well, worst-case scenario,

I'll make sure at least
one of these activates.

I need you to come with us
to the Tower of London.

From its magical glyph,

297
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,125
I'm sensing it's of
the Thunder God, Thor.

Don't be so naïve to
immediately think it's Mjöllnir.

It's not.

The thunder god has used
other weapons before--

at least once.

easier for women to use!

00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,041
Under whose orders
are you doing this?

319
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,208
Is it France?

320
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,125
Is it the Roman Orthodoxy?

321
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,500
France or the Roman Orthodoxy?

322
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,541
Right.

323
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,000
[CARISSA] As it turns out,
our sister didn't come.

324
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,375
What's Riméa doing?

325
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,833
I don't know. She's just
always had a difficult time

326
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,041
trusting others.

327
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,375
I recognize that France
has been involved

328
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,166
in a series of incidents.

329
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,083
But that doesn't mean
the Roman Orthodoxy

330
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,541
didn't influence them somehow.

331
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,666
Is seeking military
action against France

332
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,625
the only dialogue
we can hope to have?

333
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,375
[CARISSA] If you'd like
to see it go a different way,

334
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,666
you'd better come up
with a specific solution.

335
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,375
Our sister is the brains.

336
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:14,458
I specialize in war.
And you, in virtue.

337
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,125
Perhaps it's your
calling to come up with

338
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,416
a more effective method
of dealing with this.

339
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,333
Sister.

340
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,708
[CARISSA]
Brace yourselves.

341
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,541
We're nearly to Folkestone.

342
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,083
[BAYLOUPE]
Ridiculous.

343
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,958
That idiot Lessar has
managed to mess up

344
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,333
everything somehow.

345
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,875
This is supposed
to be a direct line.

346
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,125
Why's it curving?

347
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,625
[ITSUWA]
You might learn something.

348
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,250
There are many magical
training grounds in London.

349
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,708
[BAYLOUPE]
It can't be.

350
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:49,791
[BAYLOUPE gasps]

351
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,375
[AGNESE]
According to our intel,

352
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,500
New Light is made
up of four people.

353
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,083
If there are still
three more of them,

354
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,291
this could be a
bit of a problem.

355
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,500
[ITSUWA] I think I have some
good news on that front.

356
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,333
[ITSUWA]
Two to go.

357
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,375
[alarm ringing]

358
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,416
Man, you like playing
it fast and loose!

359
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,625
[LESSAR]
By all appearances,

360
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,958
you are neither a sorcerer
nor are you British.

361
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,333
What reason could
someone like you

362
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,750
possibly have for pursuing me?

363
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,750
Whatever the case may be,
not being British

364
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,166
means you're instantly out!

365
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,916
You have no stake in this!

366
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,458
[KAMIJO]
Meaning what?

367
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,708
[LESSAR] You don't really
need to understand.

368
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,833
All I can tell you is that
we intend to steer Britain

369
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,166
in a different direction
right at the breaking point.

370
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,958
Damn it!

371
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,500
[LESSAR grunts]

372
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,875
Don't tell me.
It's tempered glass.

373
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,000
A fall from this
height would kill me.

374
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,250
[KAMIJO laughs]

375
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,166
Will it be death
or apprehension?

376
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,083
Apprehension! Uh...

377
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,666
Wah! I'm gonna die!

378
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,708
[LESSAR] If you don't catch me,
I'm the one who's gonna die!

379
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,041
[screams]

380
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,250
[KAMIJO]
Huh?

381
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,416
That's a major point deduction!

382
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,291
I'm going after
her now, all right?

383
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,958
[KAMIJO]
"Skidbladnir"?

384
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,583
[AGNESE] Yes. The cases they're
carrying with them right now.

385
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,333
Its effect as a magical item

386
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,458
is to take whatever
is placed in Case A

387
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,666
and teleport it to Case B,
Case C, or Case D.

388
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,291
The item can be passed to
anyone within 100 kilometers.

389
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,250
So they can pass around
an important object

390
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,833
as if they're playing
a game of lacrosse?

391
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,291
[AGNESE]
I suppose so.

392
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,958
But be aware that
it could be a bomb

393
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,333
or some other weapon.

394
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,958
Yeah, I got it.

395
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,125
[AGNESE] New Light is
made up of four members.

396
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,666
Two of them have
already been brought down.

397
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,333
The main item must
be in one of the two

398
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,208
remaining members' cases.

399
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,333
So hurry.

400
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,750
[KAMIJO yells]

401
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,208
[KAMIJO]
Are you kidding me?!

402
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,250
[grunts]

403
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,000
[LESSAR]
No!

404
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,208
[KAMIJO yells]

405
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,458
[BOTH yelp]

406
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,833
[KAMIJO]
We know what it is you're after.

407
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,708
We've already caught the others.

408
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,208
[LESSAR]
Sure, but it doesn't matter

409
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,416
if you haven't figured out where
Lancis is hiding, does it?

410
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,750
The three of us
are acting as relays.

411
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,458
You see, all I have to do is
pass it to another member

412
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,291
and our mission will succeed.

413
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,916
[KAMIJO]
Relays?

414
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,791
[LESSAR] I can't believe it
never crossed your mind

415
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,250
from the moment you
found out these were

416
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,833
mass produced.

417
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,375
You never imagined there'd be
a fifth Skidbladnir, did you?

418
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,333
Guess not.
Who'd you send it to?

419
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,166
Tell me who's carrying
the fifth case!

420
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,958
[LESSAR]
The objective has been achieved,

421
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,416
but I lost the race
in the process.

422
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,000
And I'm okay with that.

423
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,500
So if you're going to shut me
up, now would be the best time.

424
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,083
[ORIANA]
A sniper?

425
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,375
[KAMIJO] Damn it!
Oriana, call an ambulance!

426
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,625
[ORIANA]
Robin Hood?

427
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,875
[KAMIJO]
What is that?

428
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,708
[ORIANA] A magical item
used by the knights

429
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,666
for long-range sharpshooting.

430
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,000
It was developed by a
well-known military unit

431
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,875
working directly under Carissa.

432
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,416
And if that same unit is
involved in silencing New Light,

433
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,125
then that means...

434
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,125
It means you know
what we were transporting.

435
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,166
Curtana Original.

436
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,666
It's the ceremonial sword
used in coronations

437
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,166
once lost to history.

438
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,125
The greatest magical item
in the United Kingdom.

439
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,833
Much stronger and far
superior to Curtana Second.

440
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:52,416
No sword is worthier
or more perfectly suited

441
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,916
to transform Britain.

442
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,041
Alert every knight hidden
throughout the land!

443
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,625
Be ready to move quickly!

444
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,375
Let the invasion commence!

445
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,500
Curtana Original is
now in our hands!

446
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,916
Those who do not wish to
see their country befouled

447
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,708
are invited to rise up
with me, Carissa,

448
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,541
as I am now your
new head of state!

449
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,916
This is the start of a
new United Kingdom.

450
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,708
We will improve whatever
we see as necessary.

451
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,541
And whatever we don't need

452
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,000
will be destroyed!

453
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,750
[KAMIJO]
An invasion by the knights?

454
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,458
Chaos brought about
by all this fighting

455
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,875
will be slashed by
one man's sword.

456
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,666
His name is William Orwell.

457
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,500
Next time, "Mercenary."

458
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:10,375
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
