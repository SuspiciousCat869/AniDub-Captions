Damn it!

00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,750
Of all the buildings
in the city,

00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,500
why did they have
to choose this one?

I need to get into those

I'm surprised it isn't
assumed by now

00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,416
that pilots carry weapons.

Takitsubo, are you all right?

20
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,041
And where are you?

00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,333
[TAKITSUBO]
I'm at our meetup place.

00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,375
Please tell me you're not hurt.

I'm okay.

I found a safe place
to take shelter for now.

Luckily it doesn't seem
like they've even noticed

I'm in here.

00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,250
[HAMAZURA] Hold on,
then why do you sound like

33
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,666
you're so exhausted?

34
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,833
Just feeling a little worse now,
and I'm short of breath.

35
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:50,708
It's nothing that you need
to be worried about, though.

36
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,500
[HAMAZURA] Got it.
It's going to be all right.

37
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,208
I'll be over there soon.

38
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,541
I'm coming to save you.
I promise.

39
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,750
So just hang in there
a little while longer.

40
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,875
[TAKITSUBO]
No! Please don't!

41
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,875
You have to stay away.

42
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,708
I've counted ten of them.

43
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:11,666
All with submachine guns
and grenades at the ready.

If you come barging in now,

45
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,666
you won't be able to handle
them on your own.

So please stay where you are!

47
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,250
I can't. I'm coming.

You hear me? I'm on my way!

[HAMAZURA]
Please.

50
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,583
You can charge me
with whatever you want.

51
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,375
I wouldn't care if you dropped
me into the pits of Hell.

52
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,625
All I want to do
is rescue my friend.

[PILOT 16A]
You should've said that sooner.

56
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,833
I've been hijacked.

57
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,458
The culprit is carrying a gun.

58
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,333
He's also got a small metal
drum filled with liquid.

Out of regard for the
lives of local residents,

60
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,333
I'm going to do what
he has asked of me.

61
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,916
But why?

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,666
I can't just say I'm
going off-route because

63
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,375
some kid insisted.

64
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,083
And I should warn you, they're
not going to let us land.

65
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,166
[HAMAZURA]
I know.

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,625

What's that?

[PILOT 16A]
An imitation tree, of course.

68
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,541
Having a real tree here would
hamper takeoffs and landings.

Not like I have a choice.

You don't have any
reason to back away

from this, do you? [coughs]

But of course,

132
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,041
that would be against
the rules, wouldn't it?

stand in our way,

we can go back to square one.

I'm so pathetic, aren't I?

144
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:59,041
I say I'm coming to save you,
then I end up like this.

What's even better,

146

I told off the guy who
probably saved your life.

Man, I really screwed that up.

148
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,291
[TAKITSUBO]
No, that's not true.

149
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,625
Hamazura, you came here
without any back-up

150
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,750
and risked your life--

151

I would never
call that pathetic.

I'm fine being called
a third-string punk.

But at the very least,

160
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,833
I wanna be the kind

Typically when you hear

[MONAKA]
It's true, then?

320
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,083
You are planning
to fight him, aren't you?

321
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,208
Be honest.

322
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,833
Ms. Oyafune!

323
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,083
[MONAKA] Who exactly were these
"cowards" that young boy

324
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,750
was speaking of?

325
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,250
Does that refer to the darkness
that lurks in the city,

326
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,916
or to those who know
of this darkness

327
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,958
but give up the fight?

328
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,208
What am I supposed
to do at this point?

329
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,875
Nobody cares.

330
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,166
This is your life, isn't it?

331
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,666
You get to decide.

[SECRETARY 16A gasps]
Ms. Oyafune?

333
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,625
[MONAKA] My eyes have
finally been opened.

334
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,625
I've decided on the
best course of action.

335
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,791
We're going to
Shiokishi's place.

336
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,000
[HAMAZURA] Did you get
in touch with Kinuhata?

337
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,833
Not yet.
My calls aren't going through.

338
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,375
I wonder if something happened.

339
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,250
We waited as long as we
could for her to show up.

340
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,625
So then... How are we
going to find her?

341
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,916
Let's not forget,
she's a tough Level Four.

342
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,791
She's stronger than us.

343
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,541
It'll take something
substantial to kill her.

[CROWD yelling]

345

[HAMAZURA]
Now what's going on?

346
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,625
That looks pretty
substantial to me!

347
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,250
Hamazura, over there.

348
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,333
She could be in
that underground mall.

349
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,041
[HAMAZURA]
This is such a mess.

350
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,041
What now?

351
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,875
Keep going or turn back?

352
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:13,958
Wait. Look.

Ultra-hit the deck now!

Darn, so close.

356
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,125
I figured that since your
ability uses nitrogen,

357
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,583
it might be smart to do
something about the air.

358
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,625
You see, there's a
momentary vacuum

359
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,875
created by the blast that
I thought would be perfect

360
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,875
for pumping you full of lead.

361
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,333
Go on! Both of you,
ultra-get out of here!

[SHIOKISHI] The board
authorization system has been

activated?

So she's decided to use
that here, has she?

What would you like me to do?

368
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,333
It appears that her
activation has neutralized

are that she'll actually

373
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,416
resort to using
hardline measures?

374
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,583
[SHIOKISHI] It does have
something to do with DRAGON,

after all.

They're certain to be coming.

Yes, sir.

Oh, great. You see that thing
on top? It's an AIM jammer.

about to be pretty restricted.

00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,041
[ACCELERATOR]
Isn't it obvious?

387
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,333
We continue to break
straight through.

Let's go.

here and stand guard.

390

be to speak with Shiokishi.

One on one.

00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,708

stay just ahead of you

393
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,125
and break down the
walls as we go along.

394
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,916
But be prepared to
stand right in the line

must have happened

you two to a fight?

to see you again.

walking straight toward me.

effort to prevent it.

Clearly you haven't.

[SUGITANI]
Poison.

00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,708
Musujime has the ability
to pass through walls,

411
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,208
so naturally that makes
her a much higher priority

412
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,541
than you.

413
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,166
[ACCELERATOR] Are you gonna
tell me who you are?

Who am I?

415
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,375
A descendent of the Koga.

416
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm part of a band
of dastardly spies

417
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,583
who have been doing
this sort of work

418
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:07,375
in the name of justice
since the times of old.

419

Oyafune is being handled.

00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,541
Once she is eliminated,

the rest of Academy
City's collective power

422

can be mobilized, and that
will be the end of you.

And then, once we have
Last Order secured

as our final card,
it'll be over.

[MONAKA] What I'd like
to request of you is

426
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,083
quite simple, really.

427
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,916
Henceforth, the following
must be changed.

428
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,541
I want you to permanently
remove the stipulations

you to incorporate

and consume the lives
of others at will.

That's all.

432
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,208
This is something everyone
else has observed

you think I know more?

It's just something that
the fellows in GROUP

439

[SHIOKISHI]
I see.

440
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,250
I am doing nothing more
than carrying out matters

are necessary to keep

442

Academy City safe.

443
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,208
"DRAGON" is just a word
that carries the virtue

444
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,958
of sounding dangerous.

445
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,916
You might even call it barbaric.

446
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,500
But that's because
you don't know

447
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,833
what's behind DRAGON.

448
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,416
From what you say,
I understand it well.

449
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,875
Too well.
See, I too carry out actions

450
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,208

[SHIOKISHI]
Are we at an impasse?

452
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,583
We both wish to
protect Academy City,

453
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:28,500
but that seems to mean
different things to each of us.

454
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,083
[SHIOKISHI]
I see.

455
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,958
That thought never
crossed your mind, did it?

456
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,625
You didn't think
about the possibility

457
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,458
that we might have
some things in common--

458
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,625
such as taking steps
ahead of time to defend

459
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,666
our own lives.

460

Must've caught you by surprise.

463
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,625
Is that really the name
you wanna go with?

464
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,041
I was so sure you were
gonna call me "Etzali."

465
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,375
Oh, well. My mistake.

That coward...

467
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,083
So then where's
the real Oyafune?

468
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,750
Does this mean she's
around somewhere

469
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,625
watching from a safe distance?

470
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,375
That's a very good question.

471
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:13,041
The talisman I use is actually
made with live human skin.

472
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,583
Knowing that, Ms. Oyafune
still didn't hesitate

473
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,625
to give a sample.

474
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,583
You call her a coward,
but peeling ten centimeters

475

of skin from her arm must
have been pretty painful.

Now, why don't you tell me
more about DRAGON?

477
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,583
Unless of course

478
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,958
you're curious about the pain
Ms. Oyafune endured?

479
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,125
Maybe you could
see for yourself

480
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,083
what that "coward" went through.

Here's a helpful tip.

484
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,333
Always have two
security outfits on hand

485
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,416
in case someone in proximity
decides to betray you.

486
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,625
If it comes down to it,

487
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,333
they can always end
up killing each other.

Huh?!

490
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,750
What is this?

491
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,500
Why? Why have all other security
guards besides you two

492
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,791
been killed?

[MINOBE]
And why not?

496
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Did you not consider
the possibility that others

497
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,458
may have infiltrated the
darker side of Academy City

498
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,291
just as you have done?

be the whole of the Law."

cross paths, a story is born.
