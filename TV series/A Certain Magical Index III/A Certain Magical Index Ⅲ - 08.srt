Damn it all!

00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,208
Hey.

00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,250
What are you doing
huddling on the floor

00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,458
over there by yourself?

5
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:47,958
He said...

6
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,666
He said thank you
to me even though...

7
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,458
I did nothing to help him.

8
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,000
I couldn't protect him
at all with my magic,

9
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,500
and he thanked me.

10
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:00,791
I was thinking about his power,

11
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,958
and how I always thought
it was so amazing

12
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,041
even before I'd met him.

13
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,708
But I was so wrong.

14
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,000
It's not like that.

15
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:12,000
He can't rely on
any defensive spells.

16
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,083
There's no restoration
spell that can heal

17
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,291
even a single scratch.

18
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:19,458
He truly fights with
just his physical body.

19
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:22,166
All I could do was watch
as he was beaten.

20
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,875
He doesn't have any magic.

21
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,500
Yet he goes on living
like it's nothing.

22
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,708
Divine punishment should
be raining down on me.

23
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,791
This isn't how it should be!

24
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,958
You've gotta be kidding me--
this is the kind of girl

25

out to protect?

The man you owe your
life to is laying there

you're saying all you can do

28
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,916
is sit here and cry about it?

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,916
He threw his life away for you
and you don't lift a finger?

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,708
How do you think
he'd feel if he knew

31
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,416
he risked his life for nothing?

32
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,833
Do you hear me?
Absolutely nothing!

[ITSUWA gasps]

34

[TATEMIYA] Acqua of the Rear
will definitely be returning.

35
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,083
And while you're sitting
around doing nothing,

36

the clock will continue
to count down.

37
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,041
Every second you waste dwelling

38
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,083
on your own useless
regret and guilt

is time we could've
used looking for a way

40

to protect him.

41
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,916
Don't throw away
someone else's entire life

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,125
just because you've got
some problems to work out!

43
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,708
You want to apologize to him?

45
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,333
You want to make
it up to the person

46

you were supposed
to be protecting?

47

Do you want to
send him back home

48
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,208
and into the light of day?

49
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,208
Then get up and fight!

50
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,125
Prove to him that you're
the best woman out there

51
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,333
and that he was right
to risk his life for you.

52
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,208
He can't be moved
by your tears or accept

53
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,583
your apologies
if he's not alive.

54
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,250
Of course, if you
would prefer to repent

55
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,625
from in front of his grave,
then stay behind.

56
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,750
If not, we must fight.

57
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:38,958
Honestly.

58
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,333
It's unacceptable to
see someone in despair

right in front of us
and not have the ability

60

to extend a hand to help him.

61
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,333
Therefore, there's only
one thing left for us to do.

62
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,833
[ROMAN POPE] So you've
decided not to kill him

63
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,416
and have settled on
taking his right arm?

64
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,541
I was told the Right Seat
of God never deviated

65
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,166
from their policies.

66
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,791
You'll find no deviation here.

67
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,291
The boy's uniqueness
is focused in his right arm.

68
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,625
If we can take it from him,
then the threat he poses

69
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,000
will be removed.

70
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,625
[ROMAN POPE] I've heard
that the boy in question

71
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,916
does not yet know God.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,833
And If I'm being honest,
I must admit

73
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,000
that I am opposed
to killing him.

at me when I told her that.

near as virtuous

or as philanthropic as you are.

79

If the time comes to
kill him, then I will.

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,250
Heh. All of those
are battlefields comparable

162
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,208
to the worst of nightmares.

163
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,958
[ORSOLA]
Because of his achievements,

164
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:26,666
he was on track to receive
a British knighthood.

165
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,666
But then one week
before his investment,

166
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,666
he mysteriously disappeared.

167
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,833
And naturally once
he'd resurfaced again,

168
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,375
he had become a known
enemy of England.

169
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,333
[ORSOLA] Not only was
he a strong fighter,

170
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,458
he also supplied knowledge
of medicinal herbs

171
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,500
to impoverished regions.

172
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,458
He showed them how
to use roots for food,

173
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,541
and many now
regard him as a sage.

174
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,750
[TATEMIYA] In other words, he's
not just a mindless savage--

175
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,333
he's a brilliant beast,
tough in body

176
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,791
and soft in thought.

177
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,750
[ACQUA]
They've fallen back then?

178
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,083
They seem surprisingly
intelligent.

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,291
Let's see...

180
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,791
There are still nineteen
hours until the deadline.

181
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,000
Have you come to
a decision yet?

182
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,041
Well, when you make a demand
as impossible as this one,

183
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,291
it tends to eliminate the need
to put too much thought into it.

184
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,125
You currently stand to
have two billion members

185
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,708
of the Roman Orthodox
Church as your enemies.

186
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,708
You have the chance
to avoid that for the price

187
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,166
of one arm.

188
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,708
I would think someone
with your intelligence

189
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,500
would call that a bargain.

190
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,250
The Roman Orthodoxy
is not our enemy.

191
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,125
It's people like you who
regularly go out of their way

192
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,541
to exploit and prey upon
those who earnestly

193
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,125
believe in God.

194
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,541
[ACQUA] Does this mean that our
negotiations have broken down?

195
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,583
[TATEMIYA] Is there anything
else it could possibly mean?

196
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,916
Don't forget that I am a saint.

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,250
I also possess a vast
amount of power as part of

198
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,000
the Right Seat of God.

199
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,000
If you truly understand
what that means,

200
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,833
and you still insist
on fighting me,

201
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,958
I will use this opportunity
for a demonstration.

202
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,166
I will prove to you that
battles are not won or lost

203
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,541
by good or evil, but by
strengths and weaknesses.

204
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,583
The least you can do
is try to force me to use

205

Um... Uh, Itsuwa?

207
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,125
I didn't even make it
through my sentence.

208
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,333
Couldn't you wait until
I'm finished speaking?

209
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,583
Whatever you have to say
to us can wait until later.

210
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,750
And that's only if your
jaw is in any condition

211
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,375
to still help you speak.

It may not be after
I've shattered it

and beaten you to a
thoroughly bloody pulp!

I don't believe this.

215
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,625
Sounds like Itsuwa's
completely snapped.

216
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,458
This is because of what
you said, Deputy Pope.

217
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,666
Oh, please.

218
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,166
A girl in love will
go to war with anyone

219
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,250
who threatens her,
including God.

220
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:47,958
[ACQUA]
I see.

221

How extraordinarily
gallant of you,

222

to see you back up

Is that so?

225

Well rest assured, there's no
need to worry about that.

226
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,458
You can reduce us to shreds.

But we'll still beat
the crap out of you!

And we won't stop until you
regret what you've done!

We're taking it that far?

230
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,958
You appear to have prepared
yourself substantially for this.

231
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,291
[ITSUWA]
Of course I have.

232
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,666
This spear has been treated
with fifteen hundred

layers of resin.

234
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,791
It symbolizes the rings
of age within a tree,

235
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,791
and the form of its hidden
spell is the fertility

of plant life.

You've done well

You killed all of us.

I see. So that's what this is.

In case you haven't guessed,

254
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,208
the form of this spell
is a murderer's punishment.

255
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,458
Each wire is a redefinition
of an individual's lifeline,

256
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,958
and the spell penalizes
whoever breaks them.

257
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,416
It's very strong,
and no defensive spell

from any cultural
region can stop it.

259

My attribute is Gabriel.

As for acts of restriction

All right.

I suppose this just adds
to the thrill of the chase.

Wow, he's here already?

[ACQUA] The bodies of the Right
Seat of God are almost angelic.

So they cannot perform

However...

The Holy Mother veneration

318
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,708
and when saints
lose that balance,

319
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,750
they don't lose their powers,

320
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,000
but they do lose
control of them,

321
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,916
and they can no longer move.

322
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,041
The Amakusa Church
once lost a saint

323
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,916
who left her home
out of fear of her own

324
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,375
power and strength.

325
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,333
After that happened,
every one of us took a vow.

326
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:39,666
Beyond our grueling efforts
to support her as a saint,

327
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,750
we must also help her
confront the problems

328
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,333
she found threatening.

329
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,083
Our solution was born
in the creation

330
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,916
of what we call
the Saint Breakout.

331
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,583
It's a specialized attack
spell specifically used

332
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,291
in battles with saints.

333
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,000
[ACQUA]
And a fine spell it is.

334
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,833
It's too bad I'm not
just an ordinary saint.

335
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,291
If I were, I might've
been finished right here.

336
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,000
Unfortunately for you,

337
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,666
a saint is only
one part of who I am.

338
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,958
I am also the Right Seat of God.

339

[GROUP yelling]

341
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,416
[ACQUA]
This is pointless.

342
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,541
Even after combining
your forces and planning

343
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,500
such a strong strategy,
this is where you end up?

344
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,250
At least you still
have a little time left

345
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,416
before your deadline.

346
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,541
I'll give you a choice.

347
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,375
Either find a way to get
me the young man's arm,

348
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,708
or become a stain
on the road right here.

349
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,291
Then you leave me no choice.

350
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,083
Very well, then.

351
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,125
Looks like you get
to continue living.

352
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,583
[ORSOLA] It appears that William
Orwell has used an explosive

353
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:37,083
amount of power as a saint
since his days as a mercenary.

354
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,041
Currently, he wields power
in the Roman Orthodoxy's

355
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,541
organization,
the Right Seat of God.

356
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,208
He also had another name.

357
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,958
A sorcerer's moniker
he crafted for himself.

358
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,666
Flere Two-One-Zero.

359
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,375
Flere is a Latin word,
the infinitive "to weep."

360
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,291
His style of fighting
appears to be self-taught,

361
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,500
but his method of moving
around during combat

362
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,916
involves a spell that
uses water as a teleport.

363
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,958
Obviously, there's
a common thread here.

364
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,291
If the name "Acqua of the Rear"

365
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,208
is associated with
the four archangels,

366
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,666
it would fall under Gabriel,

367
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,875
and its attribute would
be water, so it fits.

368
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:14,500
Heh. I see, so that means
he's at a height normal humans

369
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,791
can't reach no matter
how hard they try.

370
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,208
[ACQUA] I've heard that the
Amakusa Church once had a saint

371
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,166
among them whose
philosophy was to kill

372
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,958
using only a single
strike of the sword.

373
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,375
However, I also heard
that this particular saint's

374
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,875
disposition was that she
absolutely hated fighting.

375
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,458
Do you have the nerve
it takes to fight me?

376
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,083
[KANZAKI]
Well, that's interesting.

377
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,875
Apparently, I'm a
more childish person

378
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,666
than I ever
thought myself to be.

379
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,208
I was taught anger
was one of the seven sins,

380
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,416
but I refuse to lose
any sleep over it.

381
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,000
I won't let his
resolve be for nothing.

382
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,958
That alone is enough
motivation for me.

383
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,208
You don't need to
worry about my nerves.

384
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,000
Let's go.

385
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,416
Single Flash!

386
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,375
[ACQUA] Talent alone can be
profoundly cruel, can't it?

387
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,583
Even though we both
use the same method,

388
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,875
our results are
vastly different.

389
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:33,958
[KANZAKI]
Not true.

390
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:38,666
My foundation is
entirely Amakusan,

391
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,375
and my teachers are
all of my friends.

392
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:45,208
Therefore, I cannot permit you
to denigrate them in any way.

393
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,791
Moreover, if someone
is conscious

394
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,583
of how much power they have

395
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,333
and yet still ruthlessly
brings it to bear

396
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,208
against an ordinary
high-school student,

397
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,791
then it doesn't matter
if they're a saint.

398
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,166
Such a person has lost any
right to look down on others.

399
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,708
I'm not impressed.

400
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,083
Even a foot soldier will
unwittingly encounter a tank.

401
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,041
It's the way of the battlefield.

402
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,250
And if he's not prepared,
he'll be crushed to pieces.

403
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,208
That's just your
way of thinking.

404
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,708
That's right, and you
and your comrades

405
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,208
are the ones who
stepped onto my territory.

406
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,083
Or, was the boy
perhaps unknowingly

407
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,041
dragged into this
by someone else?

408
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,333
If you knew he was
just an ordinary person,

409
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,125
then why did you
use your saintly power

410
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,375
against him?

411
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,416
And why would I tell you
my reasons for fighting?

412
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,416
[ACQUA] Show me yours first,
Saint of the Far East!

413
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,958
I want to know that those
are more than just words.

414
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,458
I want to see your
reason within your sword.

415
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,416
See if you can show me
what it is without words!

416
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,708
[KAMIJO]
Where am I?

417
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,458
Oh, man.

00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,791
What happened to me?

00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,708
[KAMIJO]
That's right.

420
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:42,458
The fight against Acqua
is probably still going on.

421
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,416
I'm sorry, Index.

422
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
I'll apologize to you later.

423
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,666
But right now,

424
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,875
just let me do what
needs to be done.

425
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,125
[KAMIJO]
A shot exerted by the chosen one

426
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,041
blows dignity to bits.

427
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,333
After all the despair,
will the Priestess's cries

428
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:04,916
get through?

429
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,250
Next time,
"Holy Mother Veneration."

430

When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
