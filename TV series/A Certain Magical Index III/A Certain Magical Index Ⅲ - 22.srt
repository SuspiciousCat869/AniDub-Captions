What's the matter, Stiyl?

I'm giving you a chance to
do something about this.

If you're not interested,
let me know, because I will.

I don't need you to tell me.

Hostile identified.

Now conducting analysis
of available spells.

Searching construction
of suitable local weapons.

[KAMIJO] He went out of
his way to get this ready.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,708
In order for Fiamma
to accomplish what he has

13
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,750
he must need this
Star of Bethlehem here.

14
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:21,000
Which means that
if I destroy it,

15
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,833
I'll be able to do damage
to Fiamma, as well.

[FIAMMA] Let's see, I've got the
angel medium Sasha Kruezhev,

the magical item to remotely
control the 103,000 grimoires,

the Star of Bethlehem,
the ceremonial site,

00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,666
and your right hand
fit to wield my power.

20
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,625
It would appear that I've
acquired everything I need.

21
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,833
I say it's high time to ask
the supporting players

No way.

00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,833
So the reason he abducted
Sasha was to enlist the power

27
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,000
of an archangel.

28
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,583
I guess I'll just have
to smash that angel up

00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,500
was the moment my
victory became undeniable.

All I need now
is that parchment.

Simple fix.

Why don't you
retrieve it for me?

There's no reason
to show mercy to them

39

just because they're weak.

It was abandoned

into being involved with.

I'd say he's missing some
important information,

He probably wants to pair it
with Index's magical grimoires

that Fiamma has used you

161
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,750

I'm trying to stop him.

164
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,666
My second answer:

165
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,250
By the time I had awakened,
the ceremony was already over.

166
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,916
The ceremonial site was
built with an odd focus

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,666
on the element of fire.

168

[KAMIJO]
The difference is

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,125
this angel isn't living
inside Sasha's body

170
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,916
like what happened
at Angel Fall.

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,250
It's completely exposed.

172
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:07,291
However, if he used
Sasha to summon Misha,

173
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,333
the two of them
could be connected.

174
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,125
And that means...

175
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,208
[SASHA]
By way of further explanation,

176
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,833
the angel represented
by fire is Michael,

177
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,041
but the angel waiting on
the battlefield now is Gabriel.

178
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,458

the water element--

Question two, if I may:

00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,750
Do you possess the
same soul as Vasilissa?

What the hell are
you even talking about?

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
My third answer is this:

189
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,375
I do not believe ceremony
alone could control

190
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,416
a powerful angel.

191
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,833
However, to explain further,

192
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:00,000
there was one magical
item I'd never seen before.

193
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,375
Which item?

194
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,541
Specifically, a staff.

195
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,125
One with a cylindrical
magical item at the top,

196
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,250
small enough to
hold in your hand.

197
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,125
[KAMIJO] I wonder if that's
what he was using earlier

to remotely control Index.

199
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,958
If it is, he could be using
it to control Misha Kruezhev

200
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,125
as well.

201
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,666
[ACQUA]
Gabriel.

202
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,791
Archangel who signaled the
Annunciation of the Son of God.

203
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,125
He was also known for
exacting divine punishment

204
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,208
upon the city of wickedness.

205
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,666
It makes sense.

206
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,416
This is why Fiamma's
head became so swollen.

207
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,166
I wonder if he's forgotten.

208
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,083
Perhaps it would be
beneficial to remind him

all that I preside over
in the Right Seat of God.
