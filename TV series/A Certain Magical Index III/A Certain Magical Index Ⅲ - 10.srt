No, beef and fish!

What do you mean, terrorist?

176
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,000
I mean that we've
received a warning

177
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,500
from the control tower
that a member of

178

a French anti-English
organization

179

has managed to board
the plane somehow.

180
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,416
And if certain demands
aren't met right away,

181
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,166
the plane and everyone
on it will crash and burn.

[KAMIJO]
Seriously?

Yes, these terrorists
are demanding

184
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,583
that the major airlines'
customer management systems

185
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,791
be destroyed.

186
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,500
Their goal is to
completely eliminate

all of the routes into England.

188

The blood spatter
you saw earlier

189
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,666
came from one of my colleagues.

190

We believe the terrorist
was responsible for that.

No, of course not.
No one was thinking that.

I think Index overheard
that guy saying it.

238
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,708
This aircraft is
built with sensors

239
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,291
that can auto-detect the
shocks from a belly landing.

240
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,291
It will instantly shut
down all the engines

to prevent an explosion.

242

So then, if that malfunctions...

[COPILOT 10A]
The fuel gauge!

00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,541
It shouldn't be
dropping like that!

277

My only guess is there's
a hole in the tank!

00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,708
At this rate, we're not
gonna make it to the airport!

279
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,625

Creating an illusion with
just the gauge reading

00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,500
is much simpler
than it may seem.

So they're not
landing at an airport.

You're going to force them

you'd prefer to have

Where can they make
an emergency landing?

294
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,375
It would have to
be a major highway

that leads from
London to Scotland.

If you don't regain altitude
in exactly three minutes,

I'll kill every

[LAURA]
Well, this is unusual.

326
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,083
What do you mean?

327
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,750
It appears that the airliner
has gained altitude.

328
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:56,083
I assume this means they've
aborted their landing.

329

Archbishop,
there's an emergency!

330
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,541
We've identified a
large-scale obstruction

331
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,708
coming from Scotland.

332
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,750
Obstruction? What kind?

333
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,166
[SISTER 10B] It appears that our
illusion is being intercepted

334
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,875
by a third party.

335
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:11,083
It's being nullified from
within Britain of all places?

336
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,333
This oversight is entirely
on you, Archbishop.

337
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,833
Yes, I understand that.

338

Just to be safe,

339
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,708
I'd like to put things into
place with Sky Bus 365.

Be sure we have everything.

All right.

342
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,458
I'll need a transport.

It's been restored.

[CAPTAIN 10A]
Attention passengers,

349
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,833
we are safely headed
for Edinburgh Airport.

350
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,833
We are terribly sorry
for any inconvenience

351
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,000
this has caused you.

352
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,416
Is something wrong, Toma?

353
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,583
I don't understand. Why now?

354
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,541
Why did he wait to act?

355
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,416
Wouldn't it be
because he was looking

356
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,208
to create a problem
over British airspace?

357
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,791
[KAMIJO]
If he had done it right away,

358
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,250
he could have given himself
more time to negotiate

359
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,500
and still shaken
Britain up a bit.

360
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,583
He's gone now.

361
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,875
So it doesn't matter
anymore, right?

362
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,583
Should we still be
worried about him?

363
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,708
There has to be a reason
he waited until the end

364
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,875
of the flight to cause
any kind of disturbance.

365
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,833
There's still another one.

366
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,500
The cargo hold!

367
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,541
He waited until we were
finished loading cargo

368
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,000
at the airport in Paris.

369
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,500
Then he attacked.

370
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,916
And that's because he
was waiting for his buddy,

371
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,916
who was tossed
on with the cargo.

372
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,958
He was waiting for insurance.

373
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,666
Is there only one way to get in?

374
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,333
Uh, yes.

375
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,541
This stowaway terrorist
is most likely armed.

376
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,791
So that means we
shouldn't charge him

377
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,666
right after opening the door.

378
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,500
[FLIGHT ATTENDANT] But there
aren't any other ways in or out.

379
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,291
Could we use that air duct?

380
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,208
[FLIGHT ATTENDANT]
No way.

381
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,583
It's not like in the movies.

382
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,083
There's not enough space
for a person to get through.

No, it's just right.

What are you going to do, Toma?

385
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,375
There were coffee
and tea bottles

00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,125
in the free drinks
station, weren't there?

Do you think you could
bring me some of those?

But I need you to make them
as hot as possible first.
