And that'll change the

[STIYL] The items are

then it should come down
somewhere in the Arctic Ocean.

on the Star of
Bethlehem earlier.

her power will
become even greater.

194
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,083
But there's a possibility that

195
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,458
if she tries to elicit
too much power,

196

the very body that Misha is
composed of will explode,

How do we stop her now?

We weren't even sure we
could stop the old Misha,

of its true nature, didn't you?

314
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,708
That's a loose end
I can't allow.

315
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,375
[FIAMMA] What do you mean,
"its true nature"?

316
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,375
I'm sure you must have guessed.

317
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,083
And though your plan
may ultimately

318
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,666
have been unsuccessful

319
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,875
how is it any different
from Academy City,

320
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:26,583
a world with a certain sort of
power enclosed within it?

321
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,791
I see, so in my own way,

322
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,416
I've actually managed
to come close

323
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,125
to touching the truth at
the heart of the world.

324
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,708
I can tell from the
look on your face,

325
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,250
all of my recent efforts
have been futile.

326
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,083
Yours isn't the
expression of someone

327
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,250
who truly wishes
to save the world.

328
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,291
He stood, and he fought.

329
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,458
And in that moment,
he was utterly untouchable.

330
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,916
[ALEISTER] I really don't think
that's going to work.

331
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,583
It isn't a question of
whether or not I can do this.

332
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,916
I have to.

333
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,458
I won't let you trample
what he fought to protect!

334
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,916
Do you know where your
failure really lies?

335
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,541
I will tell you.

336
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,416
You thought you could explain
that right hand and Kamijo,

337
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,625
the Purifier of God,

338
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,250
with no more than the
church of the cross.

339
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,208
How very foolish.

340
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,250
I'm reading something here.

341
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,875
This wavelength, I recognize it.

342
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,666
It belongs to Aleister Crowley!

343
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,125
[LAURA]
Oh. So he is alive.

344
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:45,750
Well, then, seems things are
about to get very interesting.

345
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:49,208
Chairman of the
governing board. Aleister.

346
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,083
You seem to be enjoying this.

347
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,666
[AIWASS]
Yes. I find it quite pleasant.

348
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,291
Or, to be more precise,

349
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,541
I'm delighted that this pleasant
time will be prolonged.

350
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,875
He has done surprisingly well.

351
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,000
It was less about purging me

352
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:13,625
and more about making a shift
into a different domain.

353
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,541
I think you would be better off

354
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,291
if you spent a little bit more
time getting to know humans.

355
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,500
Underestimate them, and you
just might find yourself

356
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,208
stabbed through
the heart someday.

357
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,583
[AIWASS]
What are you saying?

358
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,625
Humans are such
delicate creatures.

359
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:31,625
I suspect my heart
is entirely safe.

360
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,541
That said, if one of them
actually did manage to wound me,

361
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,916
well, can you think of
anything more fascinating?

362
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,833
[gasps]

363
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:03,208
[SILVIA] Hmm. It looks
like he's still alive.

364
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,875
[OLLERUS] You don't want your
life to end like this, do you?

365
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,916
Tell me everything
you saw and heard.

366
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,250
Who're you?

367
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,291
My name is Ollerus.

368
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:20,583
I was almost a Magic
God once. Came close.

369
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:24,583
But then I was unseated
by the One-Eyed Othinus.

370
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,666
A wretched sorcerer.

371
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:29,875
I have good news.

372
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,333
We have looked
over the conditions

373
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,791
presented to us by Academy City,

374
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:37,541
and have agreed to a seat
at the conference table.

375
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:41,208
So, as of this moment,
I declare that all hostilities

376
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:44,666
are officially at an end.

377
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,333
This decision was reached with
the cooperation of all parties,

378
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:51,041
and it is my sincere hope
that it will be recorded

379
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,083
in the history of a
future world at peace

380
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,041
as having been correct.

381
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,958
Huh...

382
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,375
You know, you've got
awfully good luck

383
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,458
for somebody who
claims it's rotten.

384
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:10,166
Toma Kamijo.
