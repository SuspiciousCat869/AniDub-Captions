Those who do not wish to
see their country befouled

with me, Carissa,

new head of state!

This is the start
of a new United Kingdom.

00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,875
We will improve whatever
we see as necessary.

And whatever we don't need
will be destroyed!

What do you think
about this, Smartvery?

22
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,458
There's no way to be
certain that our attacks

23
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,291
will have any effect against
those knight monsters.

24
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,083
Guess our only choice
is to tough it out

crosses the border.

Great. So we're decoys, then?

27
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:47,916
Knights do love to

be no guarantees.

[AGNESE]
Hmm...

00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,250
[LAURA] My goodness, I had
intended to call in the List

47
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,750
of Prohibited Books
and have her determine

48
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,000
whether the First, Second,
and Third Princesses

49
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,000
posed a threat before
something as drastic

50
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,708
as this happened.

51
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,791
It's likely the militaristic
second princess's work.

52
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,750
Given the number
of knights involved.

53
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:43,083
Hmm. Very impressive, her
locating the Original like that.

54
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,125
As a result, Curtana Second
here is all but useless.

55
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,583
I might have a parent's bias,

56
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,416
but so far the invasion's
going splendidly.

Yes, it's been wonderful.

Perhaps her fool mother
should just stick her head

This must be quite
rough for you.

That is not the way
Carissa operates.

65
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,083
Her orders would've been
more along these lines:

00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,166
"If she doesn't obey you,
kill her without hesitation.

67

Once you decide to kill her,
show no mercy."

[INDEX] From what I can sense,
a Roman Orthodox spell

71
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,666
based on the lore of
the House of Loreto

72
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,958
was used as a destruction glyph.

73

[CARISSA]
Hmm.

74
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,083
[INDEX] The original House
of Loreto is famous

75
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,416
for having been visited
by King Louis IX of France.

76
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,791
And he was known for
his magical item theory.

77
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,375
It's possible someone updated
it and used it to cause

78
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,041
the blast in this tunnel.

79
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,875
[CARISSA]
Well, that is excellent news,

80
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:52,416
and not just for me,
but for you, as well.

81
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,916
Your analysis of the spell
and its connection to France

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,250
is definitive proof that they
were involved in the blast.

83
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,875
If you had denied
their complicity,

84
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,541
things would have gotten ugly.

85
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,500
I wouldn't have had any
choice but to kill you

right here, right now.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,875
Issue the ultimatum
to France immediately.

88
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,625
Then mobilize the military.

89
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,708
Get the destroyers to Dover.

90
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,291
I want them ready to fire
on Versailles at any moment,

pending France's response.

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,041
Should we consider Academy City?

93

Ignore them.
This is our military might.

94

And we alone must
hold the reins to it.

To hell with this damn war.

the Orthodoxy, and
the Russian Church.

We can't win.

Whether magic or science
is victorious in this fight,

00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,375
Britain will go down
for having gotten mixed up

with both sides of the battle.

102
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,541
If we're going to avoid that,

103
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,583
we can't wage a war
of just two powers.

104
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,291
Instead, we must make
it a three-sided war

for British independence.

106

Mother's way isn't
aggressive enough.

For the sake of
our nation's future,

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,666
we need to win
this war on our own,

without help from anyone.

110

Their interference
will only weaken us.

Well, then, that just
leaves my mother.

head to Waterloo station

and find a way to sneak
aboard the Eurostar train.

Let's go.

We don't have any time
to waste at this point.

[CARISSA]
Is it hostile?

167
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,708
[KNIGHT LEADER]
Likely so.

168
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,500
We haven't received word
of any reinforcements.

169
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,666
I'll bring it down.

170
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,500
Too late. It's here.

171
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,000
This mess you created
is going to take

172
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,416
a very long time to untangle.

173
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,583
But defeating the ringleader
should speed things up.

I don't have time for this.

Please, allow me
to take care of her.

176
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,250
Is that why you were so
determined to get me here?

177
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,833
Because you knew it was
going to end up like this.

00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,583
My desire to see you behave
in a more ladylike fashion

was unfeigned.

I don't understand why
you're so surprised.

184
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,500
This kingdom was first
forged around Curtana

185
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,750
and our four cultures,
and that itself binds us

under unique
church-of-the-cross rules.

187
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,458
You see, within our realm,
the king is the archangel.

188
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,375
Which means the
knights are angels.

As long as we're in this land,

Of course.

I won't use a sword, though.
An axe.

Are you crazy?
I don't have a death wish.

of your defeat in Academy City?

you should be fighting?

I'm just impressed you

And here I was hoping
we'd be able to settle things

Lay down your sword
and leave the country now.

Or stay and become one with
the United Kingdom's soil.

Which would you prefer?

Before I choose,

383
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,958
I have a question for you.

384
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,708
If you support the
Second Princess

385
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,041
and her bloody coup d'état,
and kill the third princess,

386
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,791
do you truly believe it will
salvage this nation's future?

387
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,708
It isn't the ideal course.

388

However, history is
already in motion.

389

As such, I had no choice
but to take a side.

390
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,625
So I have chosen,
and I believe this path

391
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,500
will bring the most
benefit to my country.

Neither.

395
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,375
The real question is,
will I kill you,

396
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,458
or will I let you live?

397
