How delightful!

163
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,958
Would you repeat that
to the sweet sister

164
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,708
you've gone to such trouble
to lie to for all this time?

165

Via this remote
control magical item,

166
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,625
there are periods when our two
consciousnesses become linked.

167
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,333
Which means that sometimes,
the things that I see

168
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,416
and hear are conveyed
to her, as well.

[KAMIJO]
No... Is he saying...?

Now, then, are you going
to tell me you're on the side

171
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,708
of good in that
situation, as well?

172
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,750
You carry on with this
shameless act of yours,

00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,750
supposedly for her benefit.

174
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,041
Maybe you've convinced yourself
that you're not doing it

for your own self-satisfaction.

But when all is said and done,
will your hypothetically noble

act actually be her salvation?

I can't wait for the
judgment to come down.

Fiamma!

I would like to bring
you along, too,

183

you both at once would be

184
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,791
rather difficult.

185
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,666
Not to mention, your right
hand would inhibit me

from transporting you.

Speaking of which,
don't get yourself killed.

that right hand.

[DIGURV] It's the effects of
an Academy City-made drug.

This is a small facility.

I guess since I'm
from Academy City,

205
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,083
the Russian people must
see me as the ultimate enemy.

Besides...

The truth is, this place has

Even before World War
Three started.

of Independent Nations'
border not far from here,

212
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,375
the Russian army wants to
raze our homes to the ground

213
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,208
and build a frontline base.

214
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,166
They're greedy for land.

215
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,541
They've even gone so far
as to scatter landmines

216

throughout the area under
the pretext of preventing

217

Hey, now, it's not really
as bad as it might seem.

We collect the mines
and give them to an NGO,

They take in thugs,
wannabe soldiers,

Yeah. Now's their chance.

Then we have to get
out of here, now!

All of the Sisters connected
to the Misaka Network

can have their actions shut
down with a single command

from Last Order.

265

So, sending one of
those units against me

266
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,625
wouldn't make sense.

[ACCELERATOR]
No! She's the real thing!

269
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,708
You should know that
there is a device installed

270
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,875
inside of Misaka's body
which will ensure

271
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,833
that a shutdown command
from Last Order is rejected.

272

Relying on her would be foolish.

She won't do anything
to stop this Misaka.

But you can't do that, can you?

Because if you do, that would
mean all your other efforts

up to now would be
rendered meaningless.

just have to sit back

until you're unrecognizable!

Not only once, but over
ten thousand times?

So that means you have
to have your human rights

trampled on at least
ten thousand times

won't be enough!

They just couldn't show it.

or express them!

Let's see.

321
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,958
Maybe Misaka will start with
the damaged goods over there.

322
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,208
That would be much
more effective, anyway.

323
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,708
The Misakas will experience
a drastic overhaul

324
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,083
under Third Season.

325
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,333
The network will be
expanded, redeployed,

326
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,708
and improved overall.

327
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,375
Their performance
will be enhanced,

328
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,500
and breakthroughs will be great.

329
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,458
And then, the older-generation
Last Order will no longer

330
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,083
be needed to call the shots!

But this isn't how
it ends, is it?

341
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:41,750
I'm sure one of those other
Sisters will be arriving next.

342
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:46,041
Or maybe they'll use Yomikawa
or Yoshikawa instead,

343
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:50,208
and wipe out some completely
irrelevant village or town

Well, enough.

I'm not putting up
with it anymore.

So...

360
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,208
She was created
and killed for my sake

361
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,750
as a pawn in a twisted
plan to break me.

362
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,291
That's why she was sent!

363

That's what the scum in
Academy City is after, right?

No matter how much
we've suffered,

this kid has to die, and my
mind has to be blown to pieces!

Meanwhile, some jerks are off
lounging in a nice, warm room!

how clever they are.

Well, I'm onto them.

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Which means now I'll have
to throw it all back

in their faces!

If the only way their plan will
succeed is if this kid dies,

00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,416
then I'll make sure
that doesn't happen.

is cause pain and kill!
