[KAMIJO]
Whoa...!

107
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,333
Now, ordinarily, this is
something that separates

108
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,708
the United Kingdom from
the rest of the planet.

109

That is to say,
it manages and governs it.

110
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,666
But by applying
its special attributes,

111
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,333
it can do this as well.

112
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,791
When you cut through
three-dimensional matter,

113
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,166
its cross-section
becomes two-dimensional.

114
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,458
And if it's two-dimensional,

115
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,125
the cross-section will
become one-dimensional.

116
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,208
In the same way, if you
cut through a dimension

117
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,625
of space higher than
three dimensions,

118
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,625
its cross-section is
put out into the world

in three-dimensional form.

123
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,208
It's a pan-dimensional
fragmentation spell.

124
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,125
However, there is
a drawback to it.

125
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,875
This spell makes it way too
easy to put an end to things.

126
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,291
So it's just not as
fun as it could be.

between the Roman Orthodoxy
and the Russian Church

is called Fiamma of the Right.

Wait, Fiamma of the Right?

151
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,833
That is correct, and he
has a plan in place

152
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,083
that relies upon two things:
your right arm

153
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,958
and the wisdom of the
List of Prohibited Books

154
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,875
needed to fully
exploit its powers,

155
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,041
which left me no choice.

156
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,125
Make sense?

157
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,625
Saving one of you
without the other

158
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,375
would make the plan ineffective.

159
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,750
Fiamma would be sent
into a panic if he lost

160
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,375
both key elements.

00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,291
And that in and of
itself would carry the risk

162
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,791
of even more senseless
destruction spreading.

163
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,208
So here we are.

164
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,583
I have no other choice
but to destroy the scourge

165
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,625
within the scourge.

166
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,541
However, the need arose
to quickly put an end

167
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,000
to this petty quarrel.

168
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,250
A quarrel that spun off
of the actual scourge

169
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:53,083
before I ever had a chance
to attack, you see?

170
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,791
Wait, a petty quarrel?

171
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,333
You mean the coup d'état?

I don't understand.

173

Can it be stopped?

174
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,958
Carissa and the knights' new
order relies solely on Curtana.

175
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,666
Which means they're
more vulnerable

176

with only one true weapon.

177
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:15,166
But striking at weaknesses
is not how I operate.

178

I don't have to trick anyone.

I challenge my opponents

[KAMIJO] Prevent Curtana
Original from functioning?

198
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,541
We received a report
that the Second Princess

199
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,750
has just returned
to Buckingham Palace.

200
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,500
It can be assumed
that the reason for this

201
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,125
is because Curtana Original's
power is too great

202
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,375
and therefore unstable
and in need of fine tuning.

203
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,750
Then now's our chance.

204
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,666
With Knight Leader defeated,
the alliance is fragile.

205
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,166
The knights and
the Second Princess

206
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,750
were only ever united
by mutual interest.

207
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,208
If we can eliminate Curtana,

208
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,208
then this coup d'état
will fall apart.

209
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,375
Acqua did mention something
about how the knights

210
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,416
and the princess were
vulnerable because their plans

211
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,791
were centered solely on Curtana.

212
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:06,041
Do you think shutting Curtana
down is really a possibility?

213
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,416
There's a subway
under Buckingham Palace.

214
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,125
[KANZAKI] There was a backup
system created in a rarely-used

A special car with magic
cast on it is standing by.

217
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:20,041
It will activate should
Curtana ever get out of control.

218
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,125
Essentially, it's a failsafe
put into place in order

219
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,291
to check the sword's power.

220
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,500
We believe Carissa returned
because she needed

221
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,375
this system to counter
Curtana's growing instability.

222
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,666
[KANZAKI] We plan to use
this to our advantage.

223
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,750
We'll forcibly disrupt Curtana
Original via the subway,

224
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,083
and then expend a tremendous
amount of magic power

225
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,291
from the English Puritan's
aerial fortress

226
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,458
to cast a large-scale
flash spell.

227
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,458
This should stimulate the
sword to run away with itself.

that we've made it this far

the strength of London's

more towards magic.

Oh, well, Index and I are

00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,500
You must obey the one who
bears the blood of royalty!

319
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,375
I demand you open up at once!

320
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,833
[KAMIJO]
Thanks. You saved me, Vilian.

321
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,583
I can handle it from here.

322
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,416
I'll stop him
for good this time!

323
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,083
[KAMIJO yells]

324
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,333
We did it.

325
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,166
[phone buzzing]

326
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,500
[ITSUWA] Oh, thank
goodness I got through!

327
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,458
Itsuwa? Is that you?

328
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,166
[ITSUWA]
The mission was a success!

329
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,083
Thanks to Princess Vilian
releasing the lock

330
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,791
on the magic partition,
we found the special car

331
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,125
and were able to access
its power source!

332
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,583
But that's why I'm calling.

333
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,833
[KAMIJO]
Huh?

334
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,666
[ITSUWA] You have to get
out of there right away!

335
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,000
[CARISSA coughs]

336
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,958
[CARISSA] Somehow,
I managed to contain it.

337
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,791
[KNIGHT 13B]
Princess Carissa!

338
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,416
Don't worry. I'm fine.

339
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,583
This was an attack
from Coven Compass.

340
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,291
Recover the railway
car and reseal it.

341
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,333
[KNIGHT 13B]
Right!

342
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,375
[TATEMIYA] I'd say things
went quite well overall.

343
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,791
Curtana's power has
been dampened at last.

344
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,708
Now we just wait for
the countercoup forces

345
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,833
we called in to
start assembling.

346
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,875
Then we charge the palace.

347
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,541
Once we have control of Carissa,
the coup d'état will fall apart.

348
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,083
Almost done. Which means...

349
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,458
Which means what?

350
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,541
[TATEMIYA chuckles]

351
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,791
You can't take what's not yours!

352
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,125
Ugh! I can't believe
you ate my meatball!

353
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,583
I did not!

354
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,750
[AGNESE]
Light salad is not an option!

355
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:09,375
We still have to fight,
so don't eat too much!

356
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,250
[SISTER 13A] More food!
I demand you give me more,

357
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,791
no questions asked!

358
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,000
[TATEMIYA] You know what we
have to do before a big battle.

359
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,583
You and I must fortify
our bellies, of course!

360
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,333
[KANZAKI]
Aren't you going to eat?

361
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,750
I was, but everyone's
fierce determination

362
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,000
to stuff their
faces distracted me.

363
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,250
Oh, come on!
You need a break!

364
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,500
Let me take over for you!

365
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,208
Uh, no thanks.
It's really not a good time.

366
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,500
See, we just got done fighting
and I was sweating a lot,

367
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,375
so I'm afraid my
outfit might be smelly.

368
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,500
Then I've got the perfect
Cinderella mission

369
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,500
for you, Itsuwa!

370
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,458
[ITSUWA]
Huh?

371
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,625
[TATEMIYA]
Ta-da!

372
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,416
Looks like opening
night for the premier

373
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,833
of the Great Fairy
Revealing Maid outfit!

374
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,750
Tatemiya, why would
you bring that horrible

375
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,083
doomsday weapon here?

376
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,208
[TATEMIYA] And Priestess,
you'll be please to know

377
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,166
I also carefully saved your
precious bridal outfit.

378
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,083
I never asked you
to do that for me!

379
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,500
Why would I even
need that thing?

380
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,833
Oh, really?

381
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,375
Does that mean you
have something better,

382
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,458
like a hyper-fallen-angel
sexy maid outfit?

383
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,583
Wow, you go above
and beyond, don't you?

384
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,750
[KANZAKI]
I do not!

385
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,208
Sister Agnese.

386
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,333
The far east denomination
seems to be saying something

387
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,375
about not letting good
breasts go to waste.

388
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,375
I see. So who among our camp
would be the most effective

389
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:21,000
in serving as a
counterargument for this?

390
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,625
You can count me out for sure.

391
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,458
There's no way I'm doing
something like that!

392
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,666
I saw this and instantly
thought it would look lovely

393
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,208
on you, so I brought it here
along with that pedestal.

394
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:33,500
I never asked for either!
Don't you judge my goth outfits!

395
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,125
[ORSOLA]
Then you leave me no choice.

396
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,083
I will wear it so it
doesn't go to waste.

397
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,833
You idiot! Stop that at once!

398
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,000
[KNIGHT LEADER] It appears that
Curtana Original was overloaded.

399
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,291
Was that your doing?

400
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,500
Well, no.

401
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,750
But my guess would be
that it was the work

402
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,166
of magical specialists
within the country.

403
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,708
[KNIGHT LEADER]
I see.

404
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,041
And as a result, the knights
are on the verge of collapsing.

405
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,625
Is that so?

406
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,666
If it is, it can be set aside
with your return, can it not?

407
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,583
Are you having second thoughts?

408
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,708
[KNIGHT LEADER] I offer you a
warning before you leap into

409
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,750
the jaws of death.

410
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,416
In our fight earlier,
I could only control

411
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,416
one fighting pattern at a time.

412
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,500
As a result,
I was defeated by you.

413
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,083
Second Princess Carissa
and Curtana Original

414
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,375
are equipped with
each of these patterns.

415
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,833
She can produce an attack
that cannot be avoided,

416
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:23,416
blocked, or countered.

417
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,333
If you truly mean to bring
her down, be prepared.

418
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,208
[ISAHAYA]
Deputy Pope!

419
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,250
Coven Compass has arrived
at the designated coordinates!

420
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,541
Attention! The time
has come at last!

421
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,958
Ready to go?

422
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,125
You bet!

423
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:49,416
[RIMEA] Oh, dear, it appears
that we didn't make it in time.

424
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,666
[ELIZARD] I Can't believe
they left us behind.

425
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,416
And they made me run
into my calculating

426
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,666
oldest daughter whom
I had no desire to see.

427
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,958
How rude to call me calculating.

428
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,833
Why not refer to it
as an intelligent,

429
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,625
level-headed decision
made in the event

430
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:05,458
that Carissa slipped up
and released Curtana Original's

431
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:06,583
full power.

432
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,458
A matter of self-preservation?

433
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,291
That is what calculating means!

434
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,625
Keep going, horsie.

435
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,541
I've got important business
to take care of back in London.

436
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,208
So, have the arrangements
for that flag been made?

437
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,333
The one in the British Museum?

438
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:26,375
I would say we are about
halfway to completion on that.

439
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,750
Not many would recognize
it as a magical item

440
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,708
after being mixed in with
the other general artifacts.

441
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,125
Now if Charles Conder
from the museum does exactly

442
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,875
as we discussed,
and I fully expect him to,

443
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:40,083
then it should prove to be
quite useful to us, indeed.

444
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,250
[ELIZARD] My word, with the
fate of the United Kingdom

445
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,541
on the line, they're charging
into the final showdown

446
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,916
without so much as a plan--
just their pluck and their guts.

447
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,458
Bloody fools!

448
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,708
Well, well.

449
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,250
I must say, your tone
doesn't match the smile

450
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,750
on your face...

451
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:54,916
Dearest mother.

452
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:59,041
[KAMIJO] Are men powerless
in the face of overwhelming

453
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,458
military might?

454
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,291
No, they're not.

455
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:05,000
Everyone fights for the
United Kingdom tonight!

456
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,750
Next time, "Heroes."

457
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:09,625
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
