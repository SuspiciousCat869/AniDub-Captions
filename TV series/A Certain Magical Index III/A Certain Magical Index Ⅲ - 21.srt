00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,541
[PRIEST 20A] Wait. Your
Holiness, what are you doing?

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,625
[ROMAN POPE]
I must hurry.

3
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,541
The citizens are
overwhelmed with anxiety.

4
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:44,000
They're gathering in groups
to march on the Vatican.

5
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,500
Yes, I'm aware.

6
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,458
You need not say anything more.

7
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,916
[VASILISSA]
Hello there, my dandy gentleman!

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,375
Can I assume you are still
living life as the Pope of Rome?

9
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,750
[ROMAN POPE]
Is that you, Vasilissa?

10
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:01,458
The cardinals are about to
convene a papal conclave.

11
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,583
They must have decided
that my authority

12
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,500
is no longer what they need.

13
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,875
If we want to put
a stop to this war,

14
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:12,041
it will take much more
than just my words.

15
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,000
[VASILISSA] Nonetheless,
you have stood forward.

16
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,458
[explosion]

17
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,208
[VASILISSA]
I'm sorry about that.

18
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,791
I'm in the middle of bringing
the dissenters to tears.

19
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,416
They were trying to sell out
our beloved Sasha, after all.

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,250
[ROMAN POPE]
You must go easy on them.

21
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,041
They are still our brethren.

22
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,750
[VASILISSA]
I knew you would say that.

23
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,333
So enlighten me.

24
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:33,916
How are you planning to bring a
war of this magnitude to an end?

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
[ROMAN POPE]
I will do what must be done.

26
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:39,750
But not as the pope who leads a
flock of two billion followers.

27
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,291
I will act as my conscience
tells me to as a man.

28
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,375
And as an adherent
of the Roman Orthodoxy.

29
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:49,416
I made a promise to that
mercenary, and I will honor it.

30
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,208
The Lord always has a plan.

31
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,791
It appears His plan
for me involves enduring

32
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,333
even more trials.

33
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,625
[AIWASS]
So then, what now?

34
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,250
A being very much like
yourself has been identified

35
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,500
within Russia's borders.

36
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:13,875
She is the Archangel,
"Power of God," Misha Kruezhev.

37
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,833
Once the encroachment
begins, a great tragedy

38
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,833
will befall everyone
in that area.

39
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,041
[KAZAKIRI] And when that
happens, what will you do?

40
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,250
[AIWASS]
Nothing.

41
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,916
I only undertake that
which interests me.

42
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,583
I don't mind going.

43
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,875
However...
I do have one condition.

44
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,333
I don't want you to take
action against my friends.

45
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,500
[AIWASS] As long as they
arouse no interest in me,

46
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,583
that should be easy.

47
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,041
If you do hurt them,

48
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,250
you will have made
an enemy out of me,

49
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,958
and that could result
in massive destruction.

50
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,416
[AIWASS]
Heh.

51
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,875
How naive you are
to threaten me.

52
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,416
You never know.

53
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,375
You might have stimulated my
interest just by saying that.

54
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,000
[RUSSIAN PILOT 21A]
What was that?

55
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,458
An angel?

56
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,916
Amazing. Even way out here
in the middle of nowhere,

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,750
we can still get this stuff.

58
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,250
[LESSAR] Yeah, and they
all use the same recipes

59
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,458
so you know what to expect
even when you travel.

60
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,083
We've been blending in
pretty well with the rest

61
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,708
of the human smugglers.

62
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:42,500
But I think this is probably
as far as we're getting by car.

63
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,458
We still need to
get to that base,

64
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,666
but whattaya say we
take a different route?

65
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,125
Hey, what's wrong?

66
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,750
Oh.

67
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,541
Are there really this
many people all fleeing

68
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,000
to the same place?

69
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,083
To the Elizalina Alliance?

70
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,500
The opposite might be true, too.

71
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,458
I don't know anyone who
would want to be a citizen

72
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,041
of a vanquished nation.

73
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,041
We should do our best
to put a stop to this war

74
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,916
--as soon as we can.
--[KAMIJO] Huh?

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,958
I mean, Fiamma is the
one pulling the strings

76
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,583
behind the scenes, isn't he?

77
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,083
So all we have to do now
is kick that bastard's ass

78
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,708
and the war will come to an end,

79
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,416
and peace will finally
be restored to the world!

80

You're right.

81
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:28,500
Let's show Fiamma what's what,
and then we'll rescue Index.

82
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,375
Great, so now that
we've decided on a plan,

83
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,666
we can get back to this
important eating session!

84
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,291
[LESSAR]
Now's my chance!

85
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,041
I'll pay for that with my body!

86
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,291
Okay, get back.

87
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,833
I'm not comfortable with
the random lip licking

88
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,000
and the twinkling stars
floating in your eyes.

[HAMAZURA]
What is this?

90
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,708
It was the privateer base.

91
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,250
It's wiped out.

92
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,625
Is he of one of those
Academy City esper folks

93
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,166
you were telling me about?

00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,250
That guy?

95
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,500
No, he isn't.

96
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,625
It's been handled.

97
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,833
That should be it for now.

98
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,791
I'm sorry to have to ask again,

99
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,916
but who exactly are you, anyway?

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,458
Acqua of the Rear.

101
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,750
I'm a has-been
mercenary miscreant.

102
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,000
There's something coming.

103
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,416
[HAMAZURA]
Academy City forces.

104
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,750
Interesting.

105
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,916
Looks like they're here
to occupy this territory.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,416
What now? Drive them off?

107
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,666
Not yet.

108
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,791
If all they're doing is
defending the village,

109
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,250
we're better off
leaving them to it.

110
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,041
I'm not sure exactly
who you're supposed to be,

111
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,458
but you can't keep shoring
up the defenses in one spot

112
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,708
forever, right?

113
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,833
Okay, then.

114
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,583
It's better to let
Academy City's forces

115
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,833
establish themselves here.

116
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,166
The place will be occupied
for the time being,

117
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,208
but with these guys,
it will be protected

00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,041
from Academy City
for some reason?

122
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,250
That doesn't matter.

123
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,500
We still have to protect
the village, right?

124

Okay, it's time for us
to get moving.

125

Oh, wait, one last thing.

I'm gonna make it
up to you someday.

some sort of instruction manual.

No, not at all.

136
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,333
It just looks like a list
of what appears to be

137
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,333
magical conversion provisions.

138
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,916
To the best of my knowledge,

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,333
those are instructions on how
to make a Roman Orthodox spell

What the hell is
he talking about?

146
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,000
Does this mean there's
something that exists

147
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,958
that I can't understand?

148
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,250
If so, it could end up
being the answer I need.

She's either a sorceress
or a magician.

I don't care.

00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,125
It doesn't really matter
to me what she is or isn't.

154
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:26,333
Do you think she'd be able
to decipher this parchment?

155
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,833
If she can speak.

156
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:31,458
As of right now, she's lying
in bed at a field hospital.

157
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,458
I don't plan on
staying here long,

00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,875
and I won't be
doing any killing.

Sleeping Beauty will be up?

00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,833
[SOLDIER 21A]
If all goes smoothly,

161
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,541
I'd say one to three hours.

162
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,958
That's good enough.

[SOLDIERS gasp]

165
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,791
[ACCELERATOR]
They're spies.

166
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:54,208
If I'm gonna leave the kid here,
it's my responsibility

167
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,875
to arrange a nice,
clean environment

168
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,666
where she can feel safe.

169
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,458
The place where you guys
stand isn't the only hell

170
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,833
that exists.

171
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,958
I wish I could show
you some real darkness

172
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,875
to compare with your drama.

173
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,750
[HAMAZURA]
Pathetic, isn't it?

174
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,375
I know. But bailing on them
halfway turned out to be

175
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,125
the best option for both of us.

176
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,833
Don't feel bad about it.

177
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,333
I'm not upset with you.

178
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,500
All you've done this whole
time is fight to keep me safe.

179
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,291
So no, I don't find
that pathetic at all.

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,833
[HAMAZURA]
What's this?

181
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,416
He says it goes to the car.

182
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,000
It's parked just up ahead.

183
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,791
Oh, no, I can't.

184
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,208
If I take this,
it would be evidence

185
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,833
that you helped us escape.

186
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,250
Actually, he says
you can start the engine

187
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,916
without using the key at all.

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,291
Try it.

189
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,750
Well, if you insist.

[TAKITSUBO]
Hamazura, they're coming!

00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,583
Is this the end?

00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:36,833
[HAMAZURA]
Accelerator?

197
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,583
I'm right in the middle
of hunting down spies.

198
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,500
Do you really think I
have time to deal with

199
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,416
your stupid drama?

200
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,000
But tell me everything.

201
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,500
I want to hear it all.

202
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,000
[ELIZALINA]
This is a tough one.

203
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,833
I'll do what I can, of course,

204
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,708
but they both need
restorative magic,

205
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,958
and to be honest,
that takes a lot out of me.

206
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,666
Really? I see.

207
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,875
Here's what I can offer you.

208
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,291
I can probably handle
the girl in the track suit.

209
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,833
But the little one here
will be more difficult.

210
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:15,958
That's all.

211
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,041
[HAMAZURA]
Huh? What do you mean?

212
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,208
They're different.

213
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,375
There are two distinctive
toxins at work.

214
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,833
In the little one,
toxins are continuously

215
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,250
being injected on
a permanent basis.

216
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,875
So even if I removed them now,

217
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,916
they would be
replenished in no time.

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,166
But if I removed
them from the other,

219
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,708
she should have a
more lasting response.

220
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:41,375
Wait, so then you're saying
she's going to get better?

221
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,416
Really? You're gonna be okay!

222
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,833
Hamazura, I can't breathe.

223
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:54,291
I'm sorry. I'm just so happy.

224
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,333
[ACCELERATOR] I'm neither
surprised, rattled, nor angry.

225
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,000
I could stomp my feet
on the ground and scream

226
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,625
at the top of my lungs,
but that won't change

227
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,958
the outcome of this
crappy situation.

228
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,791
Regardless, there's not a
whole lot of time left, so...

229
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,333
I just have to do
what must be done.

230
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:15,208
I'm fine with whatever sort of
treatment you cook up for them.

231
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,416
But first,

232
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,583
I need you to answer
an important question.

233
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,416
Do you know what this
is and how to read it?

234
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,375
That's not something
I could answer right away.

235
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,750
I'd need some more
time to study it.

236
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,458
Do you want to leave it with me?

237
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,708
[ACCELERATOR]
Nope.

238
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,875
At least I know you can
decipher it eventually.

239
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,666
Anyway, I'll let you get
back to treating them.

240
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,375
I'm not wasting
anymore time here.

241
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,708
I'm taking off.
I'll see you later.

242
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,208
Do you have any clues?

00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,291
[ACCELERATOR]
If I don't, I'll find some.

244
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,750
What happened to all
the spies I flushed out?

[door opens]

252

Is there something
I can help you with?

253
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,541
Yeah, cooperate.

254
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,458
With what? And how? And why?

255
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,875
I was able to find and
recover a number of bugs.

256
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,708
They're yielding a
bunch of bits and pieces

257
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,291
from the small timers.

258
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,458
What I need you to do is sort
through all that information.

259
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,416
On what grounds does Misaka
have to cooperate with you?

260
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,708
[ACCELERATOR sighs] There are
some punks in Academy City.

261
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,625
And they're planning to
use the Misaka Network

262
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,875
to do something shady.

263
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,500
Listen.

264
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,041
They were replacing a network
that was causing them trouble,

265
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,166
and you started coming
after me and the kid

266
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,666
in the middle of that repair.

267
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,375
But you need to know
that your system

268
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,000
is gonna wind up
the same way--

269
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,666
at a dead end.

270
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,583
And that's just how people
who applaud the killing

271
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,166
of twenty thousand puppets
feel it should be done.

272
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,500
That's their vision
for the world.

273
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,500
I mean, you know it
wasn't created to be used

274
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,041
for any respectable
purpose, right?

275
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,125
So Misaka must work with you?

276
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,958
She should just
give in and join forces

277
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,458
with the most malicious
partner that ever existed?

278
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,541
Okay, fine.

279
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,625
Maybe it's time to negotiate.

280
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,541
Let's talk about the
Dark May Project.

281
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,041
You mean...

282
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,166
[ACCELERATOR] It was the project
that attempted to enhance

283
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,875
other espers' Personal
Realities by applying

284
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,291
the method I use to
control my ability.

285
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,083
For you to become an
irreplaceable resource,

286
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,708
you had to obtain a capacity
that the other Sisters

287
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,375
didn't have.

288
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,875
Intrigued?

289
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,375
The question now, of course,
is what are you going to do?

290
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,166
If you analyze
the way that I fight,

291
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,500
you could find
a way out of this.

292
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,125
Yes, indeed.

293
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:46,291
That truly does sound
like this Misaka's style.

294
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,875
[ACCELERATOR] All right, then
I'll find a lead to eliminating

295
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,291
the kid's symptoms.

296
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,875
And with any luck,
you'll stumble upon a route

297
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,541
other than the one where
you'll only get used and wasted.

298
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,708
We'll keep these goals in
mind as we fight Academy City.

299
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,541
And we will outwit them.

300
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,541
I'm glad we're on the same page.

301
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,791
Now, then, stop being
a baby and let's go.

302
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,791
[MISAKA WORST]
This Misaka must admit--

303
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,750
after being built solely to kill
Academy City's first-ranked,

304
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,708
and with everything
she's been put through,

305
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,291
it feels strange.

306
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,833
She never imagined
the day would come

307
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,708
when she'd have
to force a smile.

308
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,250
I'm sorry.

309
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,666
That was my mistake for
letting them manipulate me

310
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,125
with their bullcrap.

311
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,250
[laughing]

312
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,875
What was all that about?

313
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,750
When a villain makes a face
as sheepish as that one,

314
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,916
it makes this Misaka's
reason for existing

315
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
seem instantly less
important! [laughing]

316
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,500
Who are you calling a villain?

317
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,541
Even after I
perfected the craft,

318
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,666
I could never find a way to
keep the kid safe from harm!

319
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,958
I can't think of a single
good reason to continue

320
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,458
along this path.

321
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,000
Simply taking the side that
makes the most logical sense

322
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,208
isn't good enough.

323
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,125
You and I are both monsters.

324
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,416
We didn't have a choice.

325
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,375
We were deliberately set
to evil by Academy City.

326
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,875
We never opposed them.

327
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,083
In fact, we mastered
the ways of evil.

328
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,416
But it didn't matter.

329
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,125
We were simply chugging
right on down their rails

330
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,375
as planned.

331
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,083
But the course is changing.

332
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,166
It's time to make
them pay for this.

333
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,250
And I don't care if I
wind up doing some things

334
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,541
that are typically
out of character for me.

335
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,583
[ACCELERATOR]
Please.

336
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,958
You're killing me
with that dumb face!

337
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,250
[laughs] That stupid dead-eyed
look is hilarious!

338
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,458
[laughing]

339
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,583
I know it's Misaka's first time,

340
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,208
but have you ever held
someone's hand like this before?

341
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,375
I guess it's more
of a grip than a hold.

342
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,375
I have.

343
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,625
[MISAKA WORST]
Huh?

344
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,875
I've been here.

345
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,958
A number of times.

346
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,708
Each time with the
same obnoxious kid

347
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,916
who happens to
look a lot like you.

348
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,666
[KAMIJO]
Is Academy City attacking them?

349
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,291
Yeah, but the Russian
army is attacking as well.

350
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,375
Let's go.

351
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,916
We should take advantage
of all the chaos

352
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,458
and see if we can sneak
onto Fiamma's base!

353
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,541
Do you happen to know
why the Russian army's

354
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,625
coming to the base's defense?

355
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,791
I think it's because Fiamma
doesn't want to move.

356
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,375
Either he doesn't
want anyone to find out

357
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,666
that he's in hiding here,
or he's conducting

358
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,958
some kind of secret
magical operation.

359
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:31,750
Okay.

360
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,333
So then how do we do this?

361
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,541
[LESSAR] We'll steal some
of those powered suits!

362
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,333
I know you're overwhelmed
by my brilliance,

363
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,541
but you can thank me later
in bed while you gently

364
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,041
stroke my hair.

365
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,666
[KAMIJO]
Hey! Wait for me!

366
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,750
Damn it.

367
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,875
[KAMIJO]
That's strange.

368
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,666
When we snuck in earlier,

369
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,833
there were a bunch of sorcerers
from the Russian Church.

370
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,708
Why wouldn't some still be here?

371
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,083
Another thing.

372
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,500
Why would they act like
they're intentionally luring

373
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,708
Academy City in?

374
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,708
[FIAMMA]
Hmm...

375
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,375
Is it not obvious?

376
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,000
So you'll be motivated
to defend them

377
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,750
with your all-important weapon.

378
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,583
Not that I would
let it go that far.

379
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,291
I can't have you getting caught
up in the actual attack.

380
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,250
You might lose your
precious right arm,

381
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,250
and what good would
that do after all the effort

382
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,833
I made to get it here?

383
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,541
I always thought he got out
of there way too willingly.

384
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,166
Turns out he was just
letting me get away.

385
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,916
[MISAKA WORST] Those spies
are crybabies. Damn.

386
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,500
They didn't give us much of
a challenge, now, did they?

387
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,166
You guys are no fun at all!

388
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,916
[ACCELERATOR]
Deceptive practices are the same

389
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,083
as always.

390
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,875
The key is to remember
to deprive them

391
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:44,125
of any chance they have
to make a sound judgment.

392
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,041
That weepy guy talked a lot.

393
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,375
What'd you think?

394
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,708
Everything sounded contrived.

395
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,083
The Russian army was always
planning to take advantage

396
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,500
of this war to invade
the Elizalina Alliance

397
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,208
of Independent Nations.

398
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,833
They've had their sights
set on them for a while.

399
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,833
It seems kind of strange
that they would even send

400
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,916
spies at all under
the circumstances.

401
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Those are the circumstances
that created a mission

402
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,625
in the first place.

403
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,791
They had to deliver
classified documents

404
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,916
to designated points
before any full-scale

405
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,958
aerial bombing could begin.

406
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,666
Once they arrived,
they would meet with someone

407
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,791
who was expecting this.

408
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,000
Meaning...

409
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,750
They were taking it
to somebody who knew how

410
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,708
to decode and use this thing.

411
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,000
Delicious! Misaka is
getting tingly all over

412
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,666
just from thinking about such
a self-serving development!

413
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,083
Hey, shut up!

414
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,750
The designated point of contact
was the Russian army's

415
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,625
frontline base near
the border, wasn't it?

416
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm going to find
it and raid it.

417
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,583
That means you're free
to do whatever you want.

418
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,125
So then what are you
going to do with Last Order?

419
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,291
What would happen
if I left her with you?

420
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,458
Probably a lot of activity
you couldn't handle

421
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,625
knowing about to keep me
from getting bored.

422
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,125
[STIYL] There were two remote
control magical items for her.

423
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,125
Fiamma took the one
from the royal family.

424
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,916
But the puritans'
item is still here.

425
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,750
Also, it's obvious to me
who was in possession of it.

426
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,500
[LAURA chuckles]

427
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,625
You're trying to use
the puritans' magical item

428
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,625
to keep Fiamma from
misusing the knowledge

429
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,000
kept within the grimoires.

430
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,416
Your strategy is to
interrupt his magical item,

431
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,083
isn't that correct?

432
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,291

If that were the case,

00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,333
[FIAMMA] What I was preparing
was not some giant magical item

476
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,916
or facility.

477
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,041
It was the ability to
manipulate this space.

478
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,416
[PILOT 21A]
You can't be serious.

479
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,291
Don't you realize how much
of a risk you're taking

480
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,625
by doing this?

481
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,583
Probably not, but that's
because the risk involved

482
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,500
doesn't matter to me.

483
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,125
Between those who
are doing their best to kill

484
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,416
an innocent high-schooler,

485
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,000
and those who are
doing their best to save

486
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,333
that same innocent
high-schooler,

487
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,541
which side would
you want to be on?

488
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,250
Which one could you honestly
say you were proud of?

489
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,666
[MIKOTO]
Ugh. What am I doing?

490
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,375
This just isn't my style at all.

491
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,958
[PILOT 21A gasps, yells]

492
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,333
[MIKOTO]
What is that?!

493
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,583
No way. What's he doing?

494
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:30,500
[gasps]

495
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,333
You've gotta be kidding me!

496
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,125
Looks like the pilot is safe.

497
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,333
[MIKOTO grunts]

498
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:54,916
[MIKOTO grunts]

499
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,666
[MIKOTO]
Oh, great.

500
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,083
How am I supposed to get up
into the clouds from down here?

501
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,166
[footstep]

502
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:16,875
[MIKOTO]
Are you--?

503
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:21,333
"Misaka's serial
number is 10777,"

504
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:24,791
says Misaka, politely
answering Big Sister,

505
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,875
who clearly doesn't know
what to say in return.

506
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,750
I'm guessing by the
uniform you're with one of

507
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,208
Academy City's
Russian co-op outfits?

508
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,041
"Since the withdrawal there
has finally been completed,

509
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,958
the choice was made for
Misaka to have some

510
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,625
well-deserved private
time," says Misaka,

511
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,416
reporting her leisure-time mood,

512
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,916
while holding a
very dangerous rifle.

513
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,875
What do you mean
"private time?"

514
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,166
"Aren't you here
on private time, too?"

515
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,125
asks Misaka,
seeking confirmation.

516
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,041
[MIKOTO]
Uh... I mean...

517
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,708
I'm not here on business.

518
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,416
[KAMIJO] Wings of ice
spread across the night sky.

519
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,208
A giant aerial fortress.

520
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:03,083
Divine punishment meted out.

521
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,291
What tidings do the
angels and stars bid?

522
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,000
Next time, "Gabriel."

523
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:10,166
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
