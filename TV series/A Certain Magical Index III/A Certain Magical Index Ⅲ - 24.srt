She was able to remove the virus
that was inside her mind.

12

[SASHA]
In my humble opinion,

166
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,291
there's a very good
possibility that Fiamma

167
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,750
and the Star of Bethlehem
are magically linked.

168
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,791
If I can attack this
star indirectly...

169
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,750
Dun-da-da-da-dun!

170
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,208
You're that lady from the
Russian church, aren't you?

171
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,083
Looks to me like you're
sailing up a rough creek,

172
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,875
so I'm here to tell you
about the payment plan.

173
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,208
[LESSAR]
If you look over there,

174
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,666
you'll see some
emergency escape pods.

175
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,041
I figured... with the
way Fiamma works,

176
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,916
he would probably ditch
the Russian sorcerers

177
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,583
as soon as he was
done with them.

178
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,958
So I thought I could
show 'em a way outta here.

179
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,916
[SASHA]
Question one, if I may:

180
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,291
What payment plan?

181
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,666
Well, it wouldn't be with money.

182
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,541
If you will make a pledge
to help Britain out

183
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,750
the next time they find
themselves in a tight spot,

184
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,750
we could call things even.

185
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,750
This is my first answer:

186
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,416
Gather everyone who wishes
to leave the front lines

187
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,625
and take them away at once.

188
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:04,916
I have no intention of leaving
here... until I get back at Fia.

189
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,166
Heh, heh, heh!

190
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,916
Fine! As you wish!

191
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,208
Wait.

192
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,750
Were you saying you
wanna get back at Fiamma?

193
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,666
My second answer, if I may:

194
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,750
I am not obligated
to respond to you.

195

The Star of Bethlehem

With the power of Gabriel,

199
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,166
I've manipulated
the celestial bodies.

Each of the four

have all been made.

So now, I think it's time
I claimed your right hand.

204
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:55,375
Then we can finally declare
Project Bethlehem complete.

Oh, can we?

206

That's how badly you want the
Roman Orthodox Church to win?

[FIAMMA] I couldn't care less
about that organization.

No!

Oh!

213
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,416
I see you've learned not only
how to zero out an attack,

214
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,791
but also to fend it off.

215

217

As I've demonstrated before,

218
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,041
my right arm optimizes its
output to match the difficulty

219

of whatever trial I might
currently be facing.

220

So optical weapons, or anything
else they may have...

221

This world is twisted.

It feels like it's aging,
in the same way that humans do--

And that's despite God
supposedly having arranged

all the gears so that
everything turns correctly.

[FIAMMA] How did things
become this bent out of shape?

254
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,208
The answer is simple.

255
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,833
It's because a number
of these gears

256
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,500
have already reached
their limits.

257
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:06,125
So I'm restoring them
to their original form.

258
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,791
[FIAMMA]
I'm altering the mechanisms,

259
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:17,875
exchanging the gears, and
eradicating the contamination.

260
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,333
Bathing the world in the ways
of the church of the cross

261
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,583
as it was intended,

262
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,375
and restoring it to its
former graceful motion.

263
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,958
[KAMIJO] So basically,
you're going to use magic

to alter other people's minds
however you see fit,

265
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,666
is that right?

266
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,916
It's much simpler than that.

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,708
I desire only to
teach them a lesson.

268

Look, all I have to do is wield
my perfect arm one time

how tragically
outmatched they are.

271
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,458
That's when they'll realize:

272
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,666
The only thing required
of them is to obey,

273
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,875
and right before their
eyes, I, in turn,

person in the world.

become clear to everyone,

It's not a mystery
worth solving to me.

320
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,250
I couldn't care less about
what you're trying to do.

321
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,875
But...

322
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,750
...whatever it is, drop it!

323
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,083
I'll handle
everything from here!

324
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,750
What? No.

325
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,916
You renounced it--willingly
gave up that much power,

326
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,916
and reclaimed your
Imagine Breaker from me?

327
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,333
[KAMIJO] I'm finally starting
to understand some of this.

328
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,958
Oh? Do tell.

329
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,083
Why did you have to construct
the Star of Bethlehem

330
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,416
on such a large scale?

331
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,250
If you, Fiamma of the Right,
really were some almighty being,

332
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,166
you wouldn't have had to
scrounge up different parts

333
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,041
from churches and cathedrals
around the world,

334
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,666
now would you?

335
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,958
Why go to so much trouble
to cause World War Three?

336
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,041
Your power changes to
match the difficulty level

337
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,583
of your opponent.

338
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,458
And because of that, the amount
of power you're able to use

339
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,583
is completely dependent on
someone else's strength.

340
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,541
But what could you
possibly want to achieve

341
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,500
that requires that much power?

342
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,458
Were you so desperate
that you had no choice

343
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,208
but to team up with other sects?

344
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,916
And if you're so invincible,

345
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,916
why would you ever need to
have people working for you?

346
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,125
Admit it. You were
terrified, weren't you?

347
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,208
Because the truth of the
matter is that you actually

348
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,500
don't know if you'll ever really
have enough power in you

349
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,291
to save the world.

350
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,666
The world has never
come to an end before.

351
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,000
And unfortunately for you,

352
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,125
I haven't heard anything
about it falling apart

353
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,750
in modern times.

354
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,791
Unfortunate because...
that's why you can never tell

355
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,791
if you have enough power
to save the world or not.

356
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,791
It's like my Imagine Breaker.

357
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,250
There's no way to
know what it can do

358
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:45,083
unless I'm surrounded by
espers and sorcerers, right?

359
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:49,041
So then... if you've never
been put in the position

360
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,708
to save the world,
you can't accurately claim

361
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,875
to have the power
that's required to do it.

362
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,250
And that's the real reason you
had to take things this far!

363
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,958
[FIAMMA]
So what if I did?

364
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,375
What right does someone like
you have to condemn me for it?

365
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,458
Or are you trying to tell me
that you've experienced

366
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,541
the kind of power it takes
to save the world?

367
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,500
Of course I have!

368
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:18,833
And yeah,

369
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,833
it may have been something
seemingly unimportant...

370
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,833
...but I have saved others.

371
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,083
Even when doing the
smallest of tasks,

372
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,333
I've witnessed the moment

373
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:31,291
when a single individual's
"world" was saved.

374
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:35,000
Someone who thinks they
can save the entire world

375
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,125
will only destroy it.

376
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:44,041
Our world isn't as
fragile as you think.

377
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:47,208
It doesn't need to be
saved by some bastard!

378
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,541
[chuckles]

379
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,791
[MIKOTO sighs]

380
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,125
Well, it looks like that's it.

381
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:03,291
Luckily, tanks are a lot
faster than I expected.

382
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,291
"Seeing you singlehandedly
run over them,

383
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,583
Misaka can't keep from
feeling inferior,"

384
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:13,291
Misaka says, as she
looks at you dejectedly.

385
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,708
What are you talking about?

386
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,541
All of you put together
could destroy me!

387
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,041
"You are referring, of course,

388
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,458
to our collective strength
while individuality is something

389
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,791
Misaka would desperately
like to have.

390
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,416
You could not possibly
understand how that feels,"

391
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,708
says Misaka, mumbling
bitterly under her breath.

392
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:29,791
Anyway, if I'm right,
you do have some knowledge

393
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,291
on how to operate the weapons
installed here, don't you?

394
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,458
[MISAKA 10777]
If needed,

395
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:35,750
it is possible to access
extra information

396
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,541
from the Misaka Network.

397
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,000
[MIKOTO] I'm not sure
if they were using this

398
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,708
for aerial combat or
transportation or what,

399
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:45,166
but there's a VTOL fighter
over there, right?

400
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,041
I bet we could use that.

401
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:53,291
If so, we can fly right up
to that fortress in the sky,

402
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,750
can't we?

403
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,916
[KAMIJO]
People don't just have malice,

404
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,833
they have benevolence, too.

405
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,833
They fight, pray, and stand up
for those they wish to protect.

406
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,750
And they don't need
any other reason.

407
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,375
Next time, "Wings."

408
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:10,750
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
