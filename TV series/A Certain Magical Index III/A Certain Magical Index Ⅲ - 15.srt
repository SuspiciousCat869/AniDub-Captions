[DEPARTMENT]
What sort of merchandise

2
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,791
are you in the market for?
A getaway car? A safe house?

3
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,958
Or perhaps some
monetary exchange?

4
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,541
Don't worry, I'm not going
to ask why you want it.

5
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,666
Just tell me exactly
what you need.

is that for sale, too?

8
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,541
[DEPARTMENT]
Hmm, is that your only interest?

9
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,916
Because unfortunately,
she's not an option.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,791
She's more of a punching bag.

11
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,625
What's this?

12
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,083
[ACCELERATOR]
It's cash up front.

13
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:03,125
I got stuck with a crappy job,
and now I'm pissed off.

14
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,458
[DEPARTMENT sighs]
I'm telling you right now,

15
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,500
killing her would cost
you seven million.

16
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,166
I don't understand why
you're so interested

17
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,541
in the girl, anyway.

18
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,041
Oh, goodness, there seems
to be some confusion.

19
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,250
I apologize for not
making myself very clear,

20
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,708
but you see, she's not
the one I just purchased.

21
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,958
It's you, Mr. Department.

22
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,000
[ACCELERATOR]
All right, the job is complete.

23
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,916
I hope you know it's crap
like this that bores me

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,333
to tears.

25
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,416
Need? I'm gonna need a team.

26
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,291
To collect this pile
of flesh so I don't puke

27
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,250
every time I inhale.

28
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,833
Can you also look around
and see if there are any

29
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,125
spare clothes that
would fit a female?

30
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,875
What size? How should I know?

31
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,541
Why don't you just make
sure the recovery team

32
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,125
is made up of women.

33
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,500
I'm being very serious.

34
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,000
If there's even one
man among them,

35
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,416
I'll kick his nuts in.

36
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,875
All right, that's it.

37
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,833
You're free to go live your
life however you want to.

38
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,291
Always remember it's up to you
whether you succeed or fail.

39
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,500
Wait, who are you?

40
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,458
[ACCELERATOR] I'm a villain.
Just a punk-ass villain.

of her scouting report.

44

[ACCELERATOR] I guess
Yomikawa finally figured out

45
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,791
how to use the rice cooker
to make something

46
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,125

49
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,125

Yeah, unless my plans change.

bringing the hamburger stew!"

Is that so?

53

of the phone.

Nothing to worry about.

[ACCELERATOR]
Don't be ridiculous.

64
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,833
No need to be
concerned about a guy

you couldn't even
kill with a nuke.

Those maids are proof
that times have taken

a turn for the better,
am I right?

[grunts]

00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,041
It's insulting for you
to call someone like that

00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,208
a professional maid.

71
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,666
Yeah? How so?

72
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,416
They're misrepresenting
real maids.

73
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,166
It's not fair that
I get leering looks

You want to know
what's not fair?

The fact that unsexy
maids even exist at all!

How's that supposed
to make me feel?

to have to be a good sister

So what's our

[MUSUJIME] Someday, I'm
getting out of here for good.

Hello? Hello, Musujime?

Don't forget today is the
day you're going to learn

98
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,458
how to make stir-fry vegetables!

99
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,333
I'll be here waiting for you
with an empty tummy

100
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,625
and visions of
stir-fried deliciousness!

101
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,916
I can hardly wait!

102
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,791
I hate to do this to you.

103
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,625
But something urgent came up and
we're gonna need to reschedule.

104
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,000
No, please! Not today, too!
That breaks my heart!

105
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,916
What am I supposed to do
with all these vegetables

106

--I just bought?
--Enjoy them, I guess?

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,041
I heard vegetarians
live longer anyway.

108
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,041
I seem to remember
this RV having a kitchen?

109
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,833
Or am I just imagining things?

110
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,250
[XOCHITL] I see you're
still using that face.

111
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,083
You must really love it,
don't you, Etzali?

112
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,791
[UNABARA] And you're still
as cranky as ever,

113

aren't you, Xochitl?

Where's the original grimoire?

00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,291
I hope you thought to
put it somewhere safe.

116

[UNABARA]
It's right here.

117
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,416
So can you tell me
what happened?

118
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,041
Basically, I screwed up.

119
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,583
Then in order to make it right,
I had my own body meddled with.

120
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,875
No one tried to stop
you from doing it?

You two were friends,
weren't you?

123
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,541
I don't know how to answer that.

124
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,541
I'm pretty sure whatever friends
you happen to be thinking of

125
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,250
are people with faces
I don't recognize

and names I don't know.

Don't try to tell me I'm wrong.

128
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,625
Whatever your reasons,
you switched camps

129
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:11,083
from Azteca to Academy City
and then took me down.

130

that you can lose your mind

over a Level Five

[UNABARA] I have no idea.
What's going on with you?

142
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,750
Be honest with me, Etzali.

143
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,291
Is that the real reason you
betrayed the organization?

144
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,750
Would you calm down, please?
Look, it's not what you think.

145
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,458
It's more of a
mentoring relationship

146
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,666
than actual siblings.

147
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,000
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
You mean you're not related?

148
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,083
Well, that's fantastic,
isn't it?

149
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,750
Having your head
involuntarily turn

150
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,333
in the direction of
someone much younger

151
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,250
is a battle everyone must face.

152
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,458
That's disturbing.

153
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,916
What's wrong with you people?

Am I the only one in
GROUP who's not a lolicon?

155
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:00,958
Let me get this straight--

I'm being called a
lolicon by someone

00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,166
who's clearly a shotacon?

158
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,333
Looks like it.

159
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,916
So true.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,583
What have I ever done
that justifies you

161
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,708
calling me a shotacon? Jerks!

162
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,708
[UNABARA] All right, so...
What kind of job is this

163
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,291
that requires all of GROUP
to be called in?

164
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,875
Oh, just your
run-of-the-mill request.

165
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,291
We're supposed to find an
outfit called "Spark Signal,"

166
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,166
who're barricaded up
with some hostages,

167
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,875
and kill them all.

168
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,500
[TAKITSUBO]
Looks like I'm okay.

169
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,791
They said I might
be discharged soon.

170
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,958
Really?

171
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,458
You aren't able to
use ability crystals.

172
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,666
That sucks.

173
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,000
But at least we know
it wasn't too serious.

174
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,375
[KINUHATA] Still, I'm
surprised you brought her

175
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,083
an ultra-flower arrangement.

176
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,541
I thought for sure it'd
be an ultra-bunny suit.

177
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,666
You're on that again? Come on.

178
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,791
[KINUHATA]
Ta-da!

179
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,750
And now for our star attraction.

180
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,250
Ultra-Bunny Rikou!

181
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,166
I didn't realize you were
that ultra-hot for bunny girls.

182
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,333
[HAMAZURA]
I'm not!

183
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,375
The air's kinda dry
in here, and, uh...

184
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,208
You'll be okay;
we're in a hospital.

185
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,833
A nurse should be
coming by soon.

186
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,708
They know how to fix nosebleeds.

187
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:04,875
[HAMAZURA]
Thank you.

188
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,458
You're the only one
who cares about me!

189
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,250
[TAKITSUBO]
Don't worry, Hamazura.

190
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,583
The doctors here also offer
care for mental disorders.

191
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,708
Takitsubo should
be discharged soon.

192
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,916
Do you know what your
ultra-plans will be after that?

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,583
No, not yet.

194
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,583
Don't forget that ITEM
has been ultra-disbanded.

195
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,125
I'm waiting for a new team
to be ultra-organized.

196
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,375
There's ultra-no benefit
to pairing with Takitsubo

197
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,875
since she can't fight,
and there's ultra-no need

198
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,666
for you to work
with them either.

199
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:41,333
Yeah, I have no idea what
I'm going to do right now.

200
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:45,083
But Takitsubo needs to
get back into the world,

201
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,375
and I'm going to help her.

202
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,208
I hear what you're
saying, Hamazura.

203
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,625
You're ultra-devoting
all your time and energy

204
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,541
to figuring out how to get
Takitsubo into a bunny suit,

205
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,666
aren't you?

206
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,000
[HAMAZURA]
Why won't you drop that?

207
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,666
Is that really
who you think I am?

208
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,458
Ugh! Please stop ultra-looking
at me with that disgustingly

209
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,166

when you're imagining

210
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,500
girls in bunny suits!

211
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,375
Oh, please, you really
think I'm imagining you

212
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,708
in a bunny suit?

213
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,416
You couldn't pull off
wearing one if you tried!

214
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,041
Let me be ultra-blunt with
you right now, Hamazura.

215
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,541
I happen to have an
ultra-superior figure.

216
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,875
Mine's better as
a middle-schooler

217
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,833
than Takitsubo's is
as a high-schooler!

218
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,125
You're wrong about that!

219
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,208
I know for a fact that
Takitsubo's a knockout

220
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,708
whenever she gets undressed!

221
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,541
I also know that if
you got undressed

222
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,000
it would be a complete snore.

223
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,583
Do you want
me to ultra-kill you?

224
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,583
Because it sounds like
you've got a death wish!

[HAMAZURA gasps]

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,708
That was an ultra-close call!

228
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,916
I can't believe I was so
close to ultra-showing you

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,833

How embarrassing.

[HAMAZURA]

That might be one of
the top five worst things

232
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,333
I've ever had the
misfortune of hearing.

233
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,750
As if whatever
you've got under there

234
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,291
would fall under the
category of "goodies."

Check out the
ultra-skirt-flirt! Woo!

You'll never get to see, though.

Oh, please, it's not
like it was that difficult.

The thing that bothers
me about this

283
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,541
is what those damn

from the higher-ups.

I can't believe they would
let slip the substance

of their demands!

That's the only demand I
heard those terrorists make.

290
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,750
I'm thinking the higher-ups
gave us a huge snow job,

into it and killed

00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,125
and perhaps filled
them all full of lead

311
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,500
while you were at it.

312
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,000
I think I get it.

313
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,833
What about the man who put a
transmitter inside his body?

314
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,833
If I'm taking out those
who've wronged Sunazara,

315
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,916
then should I add him
to the list as well?

316
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,041
Now, hold on!

317
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,625
I think this belongs to you.

[THOMAS grunts]

319
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,000
All you had to do was
turn over Sunazara nicely,

320
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,000
and I would have been
quite content to be used

321
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,208
as your pawn.

322
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,833
If you would have
just cooperated with me

323
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,958
like a rational person,
you could've had

324
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,000
your revenge against Sunazara.

325
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,500
This is such a waste.

326
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,041
Oh. I knew I forgot
to mention something.

327
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,041
The object of my revenge
is more than just one guy.

328
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,833
It's actually all
of Academy City.

[THOMAS groans]

330

[HAMAZURA]
Huh? What do you mean "job?"

331
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,916
I thought we were about
to pick up Takitsubo

332
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,500
from the hospital?

333
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,333
[KINUHATA] They're finally
organizing the new team,

334
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,500
so we ultra-need to get
together and ultra-kill

335
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,041
the remaining members
of a terrorist group.

What kind of stupid game
are they playing at now?

337
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,250
Takitsubo is waiting for us!

338
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,291
Fine. The private room
in School District Three?

339
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,375
[SHIOKISHI]
That bothers you, then?

340
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,250
If you want to be free of
unexpected misfortune,

341
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,500
you must never
let your guard down.

00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,875
Which is why we
don't meet in person.

343
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,666
You're probably hiding
in what's basically

344
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,208
a nuclear fallout shelter.

345
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,375
[SHIOKISHI] For those who have
powers like the one Musujime

346
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,291
possesses, the thickness
of walls is no obstacle.

347
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,500
Mr. Shiokishi,
help me understand

348
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,208
why a member of
the governing board

349
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,875
would go out of his way
to contact us directly.

350
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,375
[SHIOKISHI] I want you to take
down the rest of Spark Signal--

351
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,041
the terrorists from earlier.

352
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,166
If I said the name "DRAGON,"
would that mean anything to you?

353
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,500
[SHIOKISHI]
Sure.

354
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,083
Those are the scaly
creatures with wings, right?

355
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,583
[ACCELERATOR]
Tch.

356
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,583
[SHIOKISHI] The sooner you
settle this trivial business,

357
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,708
the sooner you can get
back to your regular lives.

358
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,375
[TSUCHIMIKADO] There are
twenty members still left.

359
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,791
[ACCELERATOR] No doubt
killing them would be easy.

360
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,625
But are we just going
to submissively do

361
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,208
whatever the damned governing
board orders us to?

362
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,208
This could be our chance
to find out exactly

363
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,291
what DRAGON is.

364
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,541
[TSUCHIMIKADO] So are you saying
you want to try negotiating

365
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,166
with the terrorists?

366
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,791
Because mark my words.

367
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,625
If innocent civilians will be
caught in the middle of it,

368
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,333
I promise none of us will
be there to back you up.

369
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,458
I thought you were supposed
to be off fighting terrorists

370
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,666
with a new team,
so why are you here?

371
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,166
Yeah, I was.

372
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,208
But then I got annoyed after
five minutes and came back.

373
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,166
They took the survivors of the
defunct ITEM, SCHOOL, BLOCK,

374
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,916
and MEMBER and created
a new team with them.

375
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,375
Then they were like, "I know
everyone here was trying

376

to kill you before, but do
your best to get along!"

Oh, wow, talk about shady!

Oh, yeah, I almost forgot:

is the best idea?

from the higher-ups?

from the six-wingers

all use infrared sensors.

up their aim.

Be careful!

through the armor?

I ultra-did it with
clay-based bullets.

461
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,166
I figured they would
ultra-shatter

462
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,708
and that would cause the
fragments to enter the intakes.

00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,541
[HAMAZURA]
What am I doing?

467
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,125
I need to get Kinuhata
back and go see Takitsubo.

468
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,916
[phone buzzing]

469
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,958
[HEART MEASURE]
It's been too long.

470
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,625
If I said this is Heart Measure,
formerly of SCHOOL,

471
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,375
would you remember who I am?

472
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,541
How the hell do you
know my phone number?

473
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,500
[HEART MEASURE]
Never mind that.

474
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,583
Is Saiai Kinuhata with you?

475
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,875
[HAMAZURA] So, you're the
ones behind all of this!

476
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,083
[HEART MEASURE]
If you hear from her,

477
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,166
will you pass on
a message for me?

478
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,833
You know those terrorists she
said she'd deal with by herself?

479
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:06,708
They've just seized a private
room in School District Three.

480
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,208
Wait, School District Three?

481
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,458
Did I hear you right?

482
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,791
[KAMIJO] Even if I have
to become the villain.

483
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,250
Even if I have to get
down on my hands and knees.

484
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,375
Even if someone
has to be sacrificed.

485
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,041
I will protect her.
No matter what.

486
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,750
Next time, "The Governing
Board."

487
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,500
When science and
magic cross paths,

488
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,750
a story is born.
