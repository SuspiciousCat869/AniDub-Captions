WEBVTT

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.064
[STUDENT]
No!

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.056
[RIKA]
For a long time now,

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:19.973
there's a certain something

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:22.351
I've secretly been
dreaming of doing.

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:23.977
And now I want us
to make that dream

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.438
come true together, Satoko.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.565
Basically, I wanna go live
the high life with you

00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:31.109
at a fancy boarding
school, Satoko!

00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:37.032
Wait. What's the matter?

00:02:37.074 --> 00:02:39.242
Please, hear me out!

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.119
It's something
I really need to tell you‐‐

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.454
[SATOKO]
Rika.

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:45.957
I have no problem admitting that
I'm not as smart as you,

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.252
or that I hate studying with
every fiber of my being.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:51.546
[RIKA] Me too! If anything,
I hate it even more!

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:52.714
That's why we have to work‐‐

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:56.093
Stop talking and
let me finish speaking.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:58.387
Even if I get into
that school with you,

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:03.058
I won't be able to keep up
with the academics.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.227
And none of those
proper young ladies

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.105
will want anything to do with
a country bumpkin like me.

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:10.774
You're a natural at playing
the quiet, dignified type.

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:15.028
They'll fall in love with you
the moment they meet you.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.614
I couldn't handle being all
alone in that place.

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:19.282
I know that won't happen!

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:20.450
I'm your best friend.

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:21.702
I'll still be your best friend

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:24.162
after we get into this school!

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.247
You won't be alone.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.833
No matter what happens,
I'll always be by your side,

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.085
'cause my dream is for us
to go there together!

00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:31.420
I need you to trust me‐‐

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.213
You liar!

00:03:33.255 --> 00:03:34.214
You're lying.

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:35.674
You dirty liar!

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:37.968
I know what "together"
means when you say it!

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.219
You'll never get bored
and give up

00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:42.013
on the entrance exams
if we can study together.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.849
If you fail, you'll have
a shoulder to cry on

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.475
if we check
the results together.

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:47.269
Walking to the bathroom
at night is less scary

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.520
when we're together!

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.647
That's what you're
really saying, right?

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:51.606
[RIKA]
No.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:52.774
That's not what I meant.

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:54.192
[SATOKO]
Rika.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.652
The truth is
that very few people

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:58.196
can do anything they
set their minds to.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:01.199
You tried your best to
learn how to ride a unicycle.

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.119
Do you remember
how that turned out?

00:04:04.161 --> 00:04:05.245
[RIKA]
Yes.

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:07.289
[SATOKO]
And walking on stilts, too.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.458
I picked up both
skills quite easily,

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.294
while you struggled and
struggled, and kept failing.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.171
This is like that.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.131
[RIKA]
But... I wasn't...

00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:17.632
[SATOKO]
Nobody is perfect.

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:19.217
We all have our limitations.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.218
There are things we can't do,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.805
however hard we try,
and this is mine.

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:26.975
I won't become a great student
even if I try my hardest.

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:29.478
I don't want to try my hardest!

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.605
I despise studying!

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:32.981
Making your dream
come true is going

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:34.149
to make me miserable,

00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:36.985
and I am not willing to
put myself through that!

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:39.154
Even if I do,
you're going to be too busy

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:41.698
impressing your hoity‐toity
new classmates in the tea parlor

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.617
to even bother talking to me!

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:44.868
Then they'll be your friends,

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.787
and I'll be some baggage
you brought along!

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:49.748
I already know
that's how this goes!

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.667
I just don't understand where
any of this is coming from.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.252
It's time for you
to make a choice!

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:57.255
You can have your dream school
or you can have me!

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.925
Make your decision
and live with it!

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.177
Why are you so
mad at me, Satoko?

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:03.970
What have I done to upset you?

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.472
Will you go on
living your happy life

00:05:05.514 --> 00:05:08.016
with your best friend
in the village you love?

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:11.937
Or will you abandon
Hinamizawa, and me?

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.648
You have to pick,
and you have to do it now.

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:18.902
[RIKA]
I'm sorry.

00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:20.278
But I can't do that.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.030
My dream is to go
to this school with you,

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:24.449
and I refuse to give it up!

00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:28.995
[sighs]

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.258
[SATOKO]
Rika.

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:43.176
The two options
I presented you with

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:45.178
were the only ones you had.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.102
[SATOKO] But I've always
known how stubborn you can be.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:54.062
You won't make this easy.

00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:31.391
[RIKA] Where are you taking me
this early in the morning?

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.559
We could've slept in.

00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:34.811
Do we have to do this now?

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:40.859
[SATOKO]
We barely made it in time.

00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:42.402
Look out over the mountains.

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:44.070
[RIKA]
Mii?

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.918
[SATOKO]
It really is stunning, isn't it?

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.754
It's so beautiful.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.009
[SATOKO] But there's
so much more to this place.

00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:07.260
The evening view.

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:08.595
The night sky.

00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:10.805
Every minute of every hour,

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:13.433
in every season, from any angle.

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:16.311
We've both lived in Hinamizawa
Village for all these years,

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:18.438
and there's still a world
of natural beauty here

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.398
just waiting to be discovered.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.233
Speaking hypothetically.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.818
Between you and me,

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.321
if someone fortunate
enough to be born here

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:29.824
decided they wanted to leave,

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.743
you would think that
person was squandering

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:34.663
a wonderful blessing,
wouldn't you?

00:07:36.665 --> 00:07:39.417
[RIKA]
Mm.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.044
You're right.
It almost feels as though

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:43.630
you can read my
mind sometimes, Satoko.

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:45.465
That's no mystery.

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:46.925
It's only natural
that your best friend

00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:48.885
would know you so well.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:50.303
And I'm glad you can.

00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:52.263
You're the best friend
I could ask for,

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.265
and I hope we'll
always be together.

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:55.392
Then could you‐‐

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:57.727
[RIKA] That's why I wanted
to tell you about this.

00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:00.772
I need your help to make
my dream come true!

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:02.649
Beg your pardon,
but which dream is that?

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.609
I've been thinking
about it for a while now,

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.111
and the time has finally come!

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:07.779
Once we graduate
from the Village School,

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:10.156
I want to leave Hinamizawa and‐‐

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.328
[SATOKO]
Rika. Were you listening?

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.496
I said it would be foolish

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:18.331
to abandon such
a beautiful place,

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:20.583
and you said it was
like I read your mind,

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:21.793
in those same words.

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:23.003
Stop, you're scaring me!

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:25.255
[SATOKO] Then you say you
want to do just that?

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:26.589
Surely you understand
that the gods

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.842
will punish your foolishness.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:29.801
Don't deny it.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.928
Lord Oyashiro would
weep at your betrayal.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.513
Lord Oyashiro did weep for me

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:35.598
being trapped in
Hinamizawa for years,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.435
and I'm not betraying anyone
by trying to be happy.

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:42.647
I honestly believe that this
is what he would want for me!

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:46.776
Such stupid,
self‐serving drivel.

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:51.239
Really. It's shameful.

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:53.324
And from a priestess, too.

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:09.632
[SATOKO]
That's enough, already!

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:12.385
We both know this isn't
who you really are, Rika!

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:13.386
[KEIICHI]
What's going on?

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:15.013
Satoko?

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:19.517
If anybody is acting out
of character here, it's you.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.644
[KEIICHI] I've never seen
you two fight like this.

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:22.979
What's going on, you guys?

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:23.897
What is it?

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:24.773
I know you mean well,

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:27.025
but this matter is strictly
between me and her.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.068
Stay out of it.

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:31.112
I understand that, but we can't
just let our friends fight.

00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:34.282
If you want us to help you
work it out, ask us, okay?

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:37.368
[RIKA]
Thank you both.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.329
But I don't think you can help.

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:49.255
‐‐[KEIICHI] Hey!
‐‐[RENA] Satoko, please don't!

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:00.975
[SATOKO]
Honestly.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:04.729
How are you this stubborn?

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:11.820
[??? chuckles]

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:17.826
You have never yet failed
to entertain me, child of man.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.042
[SATOKO] How can you
still not understand?

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:27.168
And how could I?

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.254
You're not making any sense!

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:32.715
Listen! I'm doing all this
because I care about you!

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:35.468
But that's exactly
why it doesn't make sense!

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.596
If you care about me,
then why won't you support me?

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.557
Why don't you want me
to follow my dream?

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:43.017
Let go! You don't know
what I've been through!

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:45.562
You don't know what
I'm going through right now!

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.698
[??? chuckles]

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:59.576
Your antics amuse unceasingly.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:03.204
Between worlds,
this truth remains.

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:10.628
Stupid Rika.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.631
[??? laughs] She has
spent ages waiting for the day

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:16.009
she could at last
pursue her dream.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.886
And as she's labored so long,

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:19.637
her resolve to
make good her escape

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:23.016
from Hinamizawa Village
has surely grown stronger still.

00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:25.894
But how long could she have
been thinking about this?

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:28.188
[???]
For about 100 years.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.940
The cat was bound
inescapably to Hinamizawa.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:32.692
Huh? Hold on.

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:34.694
For 100 years?

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:35.612
For a century,

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:38.489
this desire has crystallized
deep inside her heart.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:41.701
It has grown far too strong
to be destroyed so easily.

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:42.785
[gasps]

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:46.497
And when you say, "the cat,"
you're referring to Rika?

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:49.125
How was she
"bound" for 100 years?

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:51.669
She hasn't been alive
for more than a dozen!

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:52.754
[??? chuckles]

00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:55.048
You and the cat are
of the same kind.

00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:56.007
Huh?

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:56.966
Indeed.

00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:59.302
However, she's lived
in loops far longer,

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:01.554
repeating the same
frame of time again and again

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.097
across countless worlds.

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:06.309
[gasps]
Then Rika's a looper like me?

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:10.230
[???] Yes, relentlessly
pursuing a single goal.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:15.151
To free herself from the
Hinamizawa Village of June 1983.

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.695
[SATOKO
1983.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.239
That was the year
those Mountain Dogs

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.658
and their plot nearly
destroyed the village.

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:24.077
It was a difficult time
for everybody.

00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:25.620
But we all managed
to come together,

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:28.248
and we were able
to save Hinamizawa.

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:31.626
And to your eyes, that was
the beginning and end of it.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.628
What do you mean by that?

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.922
[???] The cat battled fiercely
through loop after loop

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:39.008
to bring about
that single victory.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.095
Without pause.
For a century.

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:46.933
Each fragment that surrounds us,
holds a record of her life

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:49.727
in one of the worlds
she's traversed.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.938
One could think of them
as proof of the hefty toll

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.817
that was extracted from her in
pursuit of her ultimate victory.

00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:58.528
[SATOKO]
These things are Rika's loops?

00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:00.196
[???] Perhaps you would
like to take a glimpse

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:02.073
into these memories?

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:15.920
[SATOKO]
Keiichi? Stop!

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.922
What are you doing?

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:24.512
That's Mion!

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.852
Was that something
that Rika had to endure?

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:32.186
[??? chuckles]

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:34.564
That was but the
briefest of excerpts.

00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:37.317
A mere span of moments
out of a century.

00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:39.152
Though I trust it
told enough of the story

00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:42.071
to offer you some
understanding, yes?

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:44.782
I think that's fair to say.

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:46.534
I could never have
imagined Keiichi

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.661
doing something so horrifying.

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:50.496
[???]
The cat spent 100 years

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:52.582
grasping desperately
at her goal,

00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:55.001
and these fragments
are the fruit of that effort.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.544
There were many times throughout

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:58.921
when she nearly resigned
herself to being swept away

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:01.007
in the spiral of tragedy.

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:02.258
And much as you have done,

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.136
she would agonize endlessly
over the futility of her efforts

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:07.013
to change her life's course.

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:09.349
[SATOKO] No matter how many
times you do things over,

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.392
you'll never know if doing
something differently

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:13.436
will turn out in your favor.

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:17.190
I had believed that the ability
to live in loops offered

00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:19.609
a guarantee that my efforts
to make my wish come true

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.986
would all pay off in time.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:24.280
But it's not as simple as that.

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:27.325
Give a monkey a typewriter
and an infinite amount of time,

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.744
and eventually, it's
certain to reproduce <i>Hamlet</i>

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:31.287
in its entirety.

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:33.790
But one could hardly guess
how long it might take,

00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:37.168
or what travesties it may
generate in the interim.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.420
I realize what I have to do now.

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:40.588
[???]
Oh?

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.882
If I intend to
change Rika's mind,

00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:46.094
I have to better understand
why she feels the way she does.

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:48.930
And what is your plan
to gain this understanding?

00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:51.682
[SATOKO] If these fragments
tell her story,

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:54.435
then I simply need
to watch them all.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:57.230
You realize that to witness
100 years of memories,

00:14:57.271 --> 00:15:01.067
one must endure said memories
for 100 years, do you not?

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:02.402
[SATOKO]
Yes, naturally.

00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:03.778
[???]
Hm...

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:09.158
[??? chuckles]
Truly, you always entertain me!

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:14.872
It's the only way.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:17.166
I refuse to let Rika win.

00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:33.933
[KEIICHI pants heavily]

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:41.149
When people here
talk about demons,

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.275
is that what they mean?

00:15:42.316 --> 00:15:45.236
Why won't you tell me?

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.029
[RENA] I don't think I
understood a single thing

00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:49.157
you said just now, Keiichi.

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:51.367
[KEIICHI]
Maybe you'll understand this!

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:54.745
Who was behind all of the
murders in Hinamizawa?

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.375
[KEIICHI]
I can't turn around.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:01.335
Not now!

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:05.047
If I look behind me,
I... I'm gonna.

00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:07.842
[OOISHI] I know you're afraid,
and I want to help!

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:11.596
But I have to know
who is behind you first!

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:15.099
Please. Just a quick glance,
Mister Maebara!

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:16.267
What is that?

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:17.685
That sound.

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:21.230
Tell me, you're not scratching
at your neck right now, are you?

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:26.986
[RESCUER A]
You a resident of Hinamizawa?

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:29.614
Name and address, please?

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:33.075
[KEIICHI]
I just know I live in town.

00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:35.161
And my name...

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.914
It's Keiichi Maebara.

00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:50.218
[RESCUER A]
Hey!

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:52.220
We're in these
people's home now!

00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:53.763
Show a little respect!

00:16:53.804 --> 00:16:54.680
[RESCUER B]
Sorry, sir!

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:56.098
[RESCUER C]
Sorry!

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:09.779
[KEIICHI screams]

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:16.077
[TAKANO] Hinamizawa Syndrome
is a biological bomb,

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:18.955
and by all indications,
it seems the fuse has been lit.

00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:21.624
Fortunately for us,
there are people in Tokyo

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:23.209
who are eager
to see what happens

00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:24.752
when that bomb explodes.

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:26.379
You must be out of your mind!

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:29.549
Hinamizawa Syndrome is an
incredibly dangerous disease,

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.260
and out of everyone,
you should understand that!

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:33.970
Do have any ideas as to who

00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:36.681
Takano and Tomitake's
murderers might be?

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:38.641
[IRIE] Looking at the situation
overall, it's clear

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:41.811
that it has to be somebody
within the organization.

00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:43.521
[laughs]

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:45.481
And realistically,
it would make sense for me

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:47.817
to be the prime suspect, right?

00:17:47.858 --> 00:17:50.861
Considering the circumstances
of Tomitake's death,

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.363
you're the only suspect.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.615
[IRIE]
No. I swear it wasn't me!

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:56.492
People must have been
bringing my name up in Tokyo

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:59.078
in connection with H173,
but I swear,

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.789
we already destroyed
every sample made!

00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:04.500
[HANYUU]
That's right.

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:07.378
Takano has been the person
who's killing you, Rika.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.630
[RIKA]
But it doesn't make sense.

00:18:09.672 --> 00:18:13.801
What reason could Takano
have to want to kill me?

00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:15.845
She knows I'm the
queen carrier, and if I die,

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:19.473
Hinamizawa will be struck
by an unprecedented disaster.

00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:21.809
And that's why the Irie Facility
and the Mountain Dogs

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:24.020
have been protecting me, right?

00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:47.835
[SATOKO] I came to tell
you goodbye for the last time.

00:18:52.423 --> 00:18:54.383
[SATOKO]
Farewell, Nii‐Nii.

00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:07.605
[??? chuckles]
I was growing bored.

00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:10.024
[SATOKO] I think I've
figured out the rules

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.818
behind Rika's endless tragedy.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.239
And what will you do with
these newfound insights?

00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:18.741
[SATOKO]
Watching these shards.

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:21.202
I realized something.

00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:24.580
You can be reborn endlessly
into the loops, but your mind

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:27.792
will always bear the scars
of your past struggles.

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:28.876
[???]
That is correct.

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:31.295
My power grants an
existence without end,

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:34.840
but your mind is no more
resilient than before.

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:37.843
Though your consciousness is
not bound to a corporeal body,

00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:40.680
it would not be correct to
say that you are immortal.

00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:43.307
[SATOKO] Then the same
would go for Rika, yes?

00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:44.225
As you have witnessed,

00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:46.894
the cat tossed the dice
of fate again and again,

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:48.854
and for her undying persistence
she earned nothing

00:19:48.896 --> 00:19:51.399
but endless suffering and death.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.944
The perpetual tragedy gradually
sapped her will to fight,

00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:58.823
until she'd grown almost weary
enough to give up entirely.

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:00.449
[SATOKO]
Did she?

00:20:00.491 --> 00:20:03.828
That tells me that Rika
does have a breaking point.

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.705
I'll get her there.

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:11.919
There's no way I'm going
to settle for "almost."

00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:13.379
[laughs]

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.423
And how do you
plan to achieve this?

00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:17.216
I understand that
when I repeat a loop,

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:19.927
every other aspect
of the world is reset.

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:23.097
Nothing but my consciousness
persists, is that correct?

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:24.682
[???]
It is indeed.

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.517
Could you give
Rika the same power,

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.227
so that she'll be able
to retain her memory

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:30.312
throughout the loops
the way I can?

00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:31.564
[???]
My...

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:33.107
Yes, easily.

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:34.775
The one who imbued
the cat with her power

00:20:34.817 --> 00:20:36.986
was compromised
by a damaged horn,

00:20:37.027 --> 00:20:39.405
whereas I have
no such affliction.

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:42.199
It shall be done.

00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:47.997
I bestow unto you a greater
measure of my power.

00:20:48.038 --> 00:20:50.958
Henceforth, if the cat's life
in a loop end before yours,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.545
you both shall begin your next
lives in the same fragment.

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:58.549
That would mean I can keep
chasing the same Rika forever.

00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:00.843
That is what
you're telling me, yes?

00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:03.679
Once she's killed, she's
unable to retain the memories

00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:07.183
leading to her death due to that
broken horn you mentioned.

00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:09.310
[???] Yes.
The hours leading to her death

00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:13.063
will be lost to her when
she returns to the loop.

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:14.607
Thus, she cannot
retain any knowledge

00:21:14.648 --> 00:21:17.526
of the cause of her death
upon starting her next life.

00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:20.279
If Rika dies,
then I die shortly after.

00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:22.156
We'll both remember our lives,

00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:24.658
and we'll move on
to the same fragment.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.368
But Rika won't remember

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.205
any of the events
surrounding her death.

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:31.916
This will surely prove
to be a valuable tool.

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:35.002
Rika, there is no getting
away from me anymore.

00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:36.587
This is a battle of wills now,

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:38.714
and you are not
going to beat mine.

00:21:38.756 --> 00:21:40.925
[laughs] You've given me
far more entertainment

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:43.427
than I would ever
dare to hope for.

00:21:43.469 --> 00:21:46.430
[SATOKO] For all the grandiose
talk of living in loops,

00:21:46.472 --> 00:21:49.809
in the end, this is nothing
but an endurance contest.

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.561
I desire nothing
but a joyful, carefree life

00:21:52.603 --> 00:21:56.816
in Hinamizawa Village with my
beloved friend Rika by my side.

00:21:56.857 --> 00:21:59.401
And Rika wants
exactly the opposite.

00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:00.736
She desires nothing more

00:22:00.778 --> 00:22:03.739
than to leave me
and Hinamizawa behind.

00:22:03.781 --> 00:22:06.826
Our dreams are directly at odds.

00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:09.411
There's no way I'll lose.

00:22:09.453 --> 00:22:12.206
I can't allow you
to have your way, Rika.

00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:17.378
[SATOKO]
I love you far too much.

00:23:50.012 --> 00:23:53.432
[RIKA] Next time:
<i>Satokowashi‐hen</i>, Part Six.
