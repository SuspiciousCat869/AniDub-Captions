WEBVTT

00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:10.552
It has been far too long,

00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:11.970
child of man.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.932
It was in the world with the
red sea where we last met.

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:18.393
Yet by your efforts,
you stand before me once again.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:21.313
Your perseverance is
something to be commended.

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:22.564
[SATOKO]
What?

00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:24.399
I must believe the
bewilderment on your face

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:26.360
is a ruse, Vier.

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:30.030
Or else, perhaps,
were you Mitsuyo?

00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:32.115
I don't know either
of those names!

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:33.659
[???]
Is that right?

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.410
I suppose it might
be best to call you

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:39.831
"Anomalous Spinal Cord
Specimen LD 3105."

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.583
[chuckles]

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:42.626
[gasps]

00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:44.878
Nothing you've said
to me makes sense at all!

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.547
Tell me who you are already!

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.674
[???]
Hmm? Well now.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.717
[chuckles]

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:54.012
And more importantly,
where is this place?

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.598
We're certainly not inside
the storehouse, are we?

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.435
[??? laughs]
A pitiful sight.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:01.520
Truly.

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:03.647
It's beyond pathetic.

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:06.275
How many hundreds
of millions of loops

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:08.026
did you traverse in
order to find yourself

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.820
in my presence again?

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:12.614
And yet, in the course of
making your way back to me,

00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:15.659
it would seem you've
forgotten who I am entirely.

00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:18.662
You and I have never met,
you've got the wrong person.

00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:21.081
What a cruel path
we're forced to walk,

00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:24.251
charted by the hands
of callous souls.

00:01:24.293 --> 00:01:25.586
[chuckles]

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:26.545
I digress.

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:30.173
In your countenance I see
the pain of a wish unfulfilled.

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.342
A wish that burns
so strongly its flame

00:01:32.384 --> 00:01:35.304
threatens to consume
your very being.

00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:37.472
[??? laughs]

00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:40.017
I hear your soul cry
out in anguish.

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:41.935
And what is that
supposed to mean?

00:01:41.977 --> 00:01:44.229
As a child of man,
you will never attain

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:47.190
what you so desire,
but using my power,

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:49.860
anything you might want
could be within your reach.

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:50.736
Huh?

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:54.531
Yes! I offer the power to make
your every wish a reality!

00:01:54.573 --> 00:01:55.949
And if you persist
in your search,

00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:57.951
you may find yourself
in the idyllic world

00:01:57.993 --> 00:01:59.995
for which your heart yearns.

00:02:00.037 --> 00:02:01.038
Be warned.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.914
Your trek will surely be long.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.291
Your path, grueling.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:05.667
You've said nothing but nonsense

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.085
the whole time I've been here.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.462
I'm tired of listening.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.672
Give me this power
already or let me go!

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:13.925
[??? chuckles]
Very well!

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.511
I bestow my power unto you!

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.477
You shall become one
who lives in loops,

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:25.437
spiraling endlessly
through time,

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.357
until at long last
your wish is fulfilled.

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:29.858
"Lives in loops"?

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.652
What are you talking about?

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.528
If ever you feel
your life cannot offer

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.990
the satisfaction you seek,
you may end it and start anew.

00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:39.159
[SATOKO gasps]
"End it"?

00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:41.578
So I have to die
to use this power?

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.956
[??? chuckles]
Fret not, child.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:48.502
My power is not as flawed
as that granted to the cat.

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:50.545
However many
lives you may abandon,

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:54.800
the memories of each shall
always persist into the next.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:55.926
That's insane.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:57.469
None of this is real!

00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:58.637
Of course, it would not do

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.723
for you to receive
such power at no cost.

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.309
Yet, if you simply proceed
in your intended course,

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.561
the price will be no burden.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:08.438
In return for what I give you.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.108
I only expect a bit
of brief amusement.

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.111
Which, over time,
I know you'll provide.

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:17.322
Your deeds will surely
be ample repayment.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:20.325
This keeps making less sense
the more you talk about it!

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:21.702
You're crazy!

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:24.079
Enough. Let me out
of this place!

00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:26.581
[??? laughs]
You've yet to begin,

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:28.375
and I'm already entertained.

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:30.544
This pleases me, child of man!

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:37.134
[SATOKO gasps]

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.930
Wait, is this...

00:03:41.972 --> 00:03:43.306
What's happening?

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.434
Why am I here?

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:46.893
This house...

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.562
That old lady
told me it caved in

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.814
completely during the blizzard.

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:56.820
1983? Five years ago?

00:03:56.862 --> 00:03:58.822
What's going on?

00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:00.031
[gasps]

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.625
No way. This can't be.

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:46.513
That's absurd.
"Living in loops"?

00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:47.722
There's no way.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:50.517
I'm sure there's some
kind of explanation, here.

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:52.227
It's nothing but fantasy.

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:54.354
Time travel isn't real!

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:56.439
Get a hold of yourself.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:59.484
Could I have simply been lost
in a dream this whole time?

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:00.569
I woke up in my house,

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.029
and the calendar shows 1983.

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:06.825
[SATOKO] It would have been a
torturously long dream if so,

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:09.786
but it's the only thing
that makes sense.

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:10.996
A nightmare.

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.414
It had to be.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.708
I dreamt it all.

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:18.628
That Rika desperately
wanted to abandon Hinamizawa.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:19.796
And worse.

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:22.090
That she'd toss me
aside like that!

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:23.174
It's wrong.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.135
She would never do that to me!

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:28.346
It was nothing
but one long nightmare!

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.891
[RIKA]
Sorry. You missed your chance!

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:32.809
[RIKA]
I was up before you,

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:34.060
so I decided I would go ahead

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:36.354
and pull the
page off the calendar!

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:37.397
I know you like to do it,

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.358
but this time you were beaten
to the punch, Satoko!

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.110
Ni‐paa!

00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:46.156
You okay?

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.783
I hope I didn't actually
hurt your feelings.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:51.494
I just wanted to play
a little prank on you.

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:54.122
You're not really
upset, are you?

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:57.959
Satoko, what's wrong?

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:02.505
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.925
You're acting
kinda strange today.

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.635
[SATOKO]
Everything is okay.

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:09.095
I just woke up from
the most awful dream.

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:12.015
The real you
would never do that!

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.310
Well, whatever it is you
went through in that dream,

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:16.394
it's over now.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.939
My poor, poor, pitiful Satoko.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.231
[SATOKO cries]
Rika!

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:25.987
[TAKANO]
Jiro, please. Please help me!

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:30.325
[sobs]

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:31.910
[TOMITAKE]
Sorry I'm late.

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:33.620
It's all over now.

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:47.008
[RIKA]
Satoko?

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.927
[SATOKO]
What's this out of nowhere?

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:50.887
I need to ask you a favor.

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:53.640
Would you mind taking
a shopping trip with me?

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:01.815
There's a certain
store in Okinomiya.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.066
And it would really mean a lot

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:05.068
if I could have
you there with me.

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.613
[RIKA]
We're here.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.744
[SATOKO]
We are, as expected.

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:18.915
[RIKA]
For a long time now,

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:22.252
there's a certain something I've
secretly been dreaming of doing.

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:23.461
And now I want us to make

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.922
that dream come
true together, Satoko.

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:28.758
Enrolling at St. Lucia Academy.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.926
Is that your dream?

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:33.513
Huh? That's right!
How did you know?

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:34.472
I never brought it up,

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:37.684
but I've thought
about it for a while.

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.687
And I decided what
I want is something new.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:43.857
I'd like a life totally
different from the one I know.

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:45.650
And obviously,
I want my best friend

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:47.402
to be there at my side.

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:50.488
Basically, I wanna
go live the high life

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.116
with you at a fancy
boarding school, Satoko!

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:55.869
Ni‐paa!

00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:58.955
[SATOKO]
Really, Rika.

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:01.207
Worrying about
entrance exams already?

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:03.209
That seems premature.

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.045
I don't think it's premature.

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:06.463
It's been hardly any time at all

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:08.214
since we exposed the
Mountain Dogs' plot

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:10.967
and saved our beloved
village from destruction.

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:11.926
It was a long fight,

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:14.929
and it would be a waste not to
enjoy the peace we've won!

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:17.015
I agree, that would be a waste,

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.516
and I know I'd rather goof off

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:21.269
with you and the rest of the
club than study for the test.

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:24.355
[SATOKO] Then I say that's
exactly what you ought to do!

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.107
Admittedly, our
club activities of late

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:27.734
have been seriously lacking,

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.944
but I'm sure we can
reverse that trend.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:32.197
With a bit of work, we'll
have the adrenaline pumping

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:34.282
just like before!

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:36.201
Yes, I think that
would be wonderful.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:39.829
[chortles] But of course it
would be, Rika dear!

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:42.207
What more could anyone
hope for in life?

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:45.960
Did I say something wrong?

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:49.214
Listen, I've wanted
this for so long now.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.883
It feels like I've been wishing
for it my whole life.

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:53.843
For longer than I can explain.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:58.014
[RIKA] And I've found
the world I wanted.

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.850
A world where I can
choose to leave Hinamizawa.

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:02.685
One where I'm free.

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:05.563
Up until now,
I couldn't even dream

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:08.024
of being anywhere
but this village.

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.067
You're precious to me,

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:11.194
and so are all of
our friends in club.

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:12.487
But I've been waiting and hoping

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:14.280
I could see the rest
of the world someday,

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.741
and that dream is
also precious to me!

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:20.537
I want you to be there with me,
Satoko, but I can't make you.

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:23.123
[gasps]

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:24.082
You mean...

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:25.959
[RIKA]
It's okay.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.502
It won't be the same
going it alone,

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.754
but I'll do it if I have to.

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:33.842
Good evening, miss.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.095
That's not fair.

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.888
Now I'm the bad guy.

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.359
I knew that you
would come around!

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:54.654
Well, I would hate to waste
a trip to Okinomiya.

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.531
And to be absolutely clear,

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:58.700
buying this book
is not a commitment.

00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:01.369
But I'm still
really glad you did!

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:11.629
[SATOKO] I don't think
I can break Rika's will.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:12.547
But I have no doubt

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:14.883
that I can waste all
of her study time.

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:22.432
[KEIICHI]
Please stand! Face forward! Bow!

00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:25.018
[STUDENTS]
Bye, Ms. Chie!

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.315
Chie... Huh?

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:32.775
[chortles]

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:33.776
Rika, please!

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:35.945
You know it's time for club!

00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:36.946
Excuse me.

00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:38.656
Would you please let me by?

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:41.242
I need Chie's help
with a problem.

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:42.535
Today is my game!

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:45.413
Get ready to lose at
Infinite Fractal Baseball!

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:47.874
So I hope you've been keeping
your defensive game sharp.

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:50.668
Letting one man on could
cost you infinite runs!

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:51.878
Satoko.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.880
I'm not going to club anymore.

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:55.548
What? Come, Rika.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.799
You wouldn't want
to miss out on playing

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.718
with our whole class, would you?

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.136
And in case you haven't noticed,

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:02.138
the weather is
absolutely gorgeous!

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.098
It would be silly
to squander it!

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.558
Stop, Satoko!

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.353
You can crack open that
study guide anytime you want,

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:09.312
but if you go home,

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:11.773
you won't get another chance
to be part of this game.

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:14.692
I understand what
you're saying, but still...

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:15.652
Hey, Rika.

00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:17.278
Is everything okay?

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.489
Everybody's heading
outside for club.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.033
Rika's attempting
to escape from battle.

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:23.826
I've been trying to talk
some sense into her,

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.286
but it isn't working!

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:26.496
Mii.

00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:28.623
[KEIICHI]
Hmm... If Mion were here,

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:32.168
she'd slap you with a penalty
for even thinking about it.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.212
But I'm not gonna make you stay.

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.464
If you really need
to leave, then you can.

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:40.343
Yeah, definitely,
though we'd miss you.

00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:45.473
Okay. Fine.

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:48.518
I suppose I'll be joining you.

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:50.103
We didn't mean
to guilt you into it.

00:12:50.144 --> 00:12:51.396
Are you sure it's fine?

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:54.524
There'll be plenty of time
to study when I get home.

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:55.817
And besides,

00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:58.194
this way, I get to play
with all my friends!

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:01.447
Awoo! Rika's gonna be
playing with us again!

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:03.658
It feels like ages
since you joined us,

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.369
you don't know
how badly I've missed you!

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:07.328
You did?

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.539
Can you see what
I was saying now?

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.666
Everyone around here
loves you the way you are,

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:14.085
and we're all happy that
you're a part of our lives!

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.296
Thanks. That means a lot!

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:21.050
[SATOKO sighs]

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:23.344
That was a ballgame
for the history books!

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:25.179
Comeback after comeback.

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:26.347
I don't think linear baseball

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:28.474
could ever compete
with that thrill!

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:30.685
I can't remember ever
hearing about a baseball game

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:33.062
where the score
reached triple digits.

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:35.940
And to top it off, you got
to seal the deal for our team

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:38.818
with an amazing grand slam,
right at the very end!

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.738
It was satisfying,
but it took a lot out of me.

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:43.906
I think my legs might fall off.

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:46.326
Oh yeah,
I'm super worn out, too,

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:49.370
and just imagine if we
had gone into extra innings.

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:50.330
[SATOKO]
Well, it sounds like

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:52.373
we're both gonna need
to get to bed early.

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:54.834
[RIKA] Gonna walk in
the door and fall asleep.

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:57.253
Hope I reach my futon.

00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:06.763
I think that's going
to work out just fine.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.943
Rika?

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:22.612
[gasps]

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:55.686
‐‐[SATOKO] Rika?
‐‐[RIKA] Huh?

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:58.689
I thought you were still asleep.

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:02.360
[SATOKO]
Hey. Can we talk for a second?

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:12.078
There's no chance you're
going to let me talk you

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.331
out of enrolling at
St. Lucia Academy, huh?

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:17.291
I refuse to give up on it.

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:19.585
I know we can do it if we try!

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:21.629
[sighs]

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:23.798
To be completely honest.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.926
I don't want to go to a school
that far from the village.

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:30.388
I know you dream of going
to St. Lucia, but I don't.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.349
I understand that the entrance
exam is a lot of pressure.

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:34.308
But please...

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.978
The exam's not the issue.

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:39.147
Of course I absolutely
detest studying,

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:40.648
and we both know that.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.316
But I realize
how much you want this,

00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:45.653
and I would do anything
to give it to you.

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:47.780
I'd pour myself into it,

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:51.451
because I really, really
want you to be happy, Rika.

00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:53.202
I'd give it everything I had,

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:54.704
and maybe that would be enough,

00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:57.582
and we'd get to enroll at
the school you dreamed of.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:00.877
But if I put all
I have into the exam,

00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:03.629
I won't have anything
left for the school year,

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:06.424
then I'll keep
falling further behind

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:08.551
till I can never catch up.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.056
It scares me.

00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:15.391
I don't know how
I could live through that

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:18.227
when just imagining
it hurts so much.

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:21.564
[RIKA] Maybe it will be as
hard as you expect it to be.

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:26.235
But I'll be right there
by your side!

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:32.450
I hate studying at least
as much as you do.

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:35.203
But still, if you're ever
struggling with anything.

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:38.789
I'll do everything I can
to help you understand it all.

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:42.293
We don't have to stop being
study buddies once we get in!

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:45.505
That might be more
complicated than expected.

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:47.048
You'll grow up into a beautiful,

00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:50.134
elegant, effortlessly
graceful young lady.

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:52.094
All of the girls at
St. Lucia will adore you

00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:54.597
from the moment
you walk in the door.

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.057
I'm not like you.

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:58.935
I'll always be the loud girl
from the boonies.

00:16:58.976 --> 00:17:01.270
The troublemaker
they try to avoid.

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:04.398
And I'll never be able to turn
myself into what they want.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.942
[RIKA]
Satoko.

00:17:05.983 --> 00:17:09.237
I would push myself to my limit
getting into the school,

00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:11.030
and I'd have to keep
pushing myself further

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:13.699
to have some hope of graduating.

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:16.661
If I try this,
it's gonna break me.

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:21.207
Thank you for telling me.

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:22.625
If we're going
to do this together,

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:25.253
I need to know how
you really feel about it.

00:17:25.294 --> 00:17:26.462
Rika.

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:28.464
I'll never abandon you.

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:29.423
If you're in trouble,

00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:31.634
I'm always ready
to lend you a hand.

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:33.803
You're my best friend
in the whole world,

00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:36.764
so if you're struggling,
call me, and I'll be there.

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:38.057
I promise.

00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:39.934
So please believe in me.

00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:41.727
Let's get into
St. Lucia Academy.

00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:43.479
Together.

00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:48.276
You'll really keep that
promise, no matter what?

00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:49.193
Of course!

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:50.653
No matter what.

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:53.698
[SATOKO]
How could I refuse?

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:55.157
Then I'm going to hold you to it

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:58.744
and allow you this one chance
to live up to your word.

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:01.622
I swear I won't
let you down, Satoko!

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:04.625
[sighs] I'll need to
settle in for a few years

00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:06.752
of studying starting tomorrow.

00:18:06.794 --> 00:18:08.129
But as long as we work together,

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.006
I know we'll make it in the end!

00:18:10.047 --> 00:18:11.465
Ni‐paa!

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:15.136
[laughter]

00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:25.980
[RIKA]
Please, tell me more.

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:27.690
[GIRL C]
Oh, happily!

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:31.652
My goodness. I am fortunate.

00:18:31.694 --> 00:18:33.446
You're all lovely.

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:43.581
[SATOKO] Rika. You talk me
into trusting you again,

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:46.417
and then you go
right back to this.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.088
Are you mocking me?

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.508
Is it fun for you,
watching me go through this?

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.385
You'd never abandon me.

00:18:56.427 --> 00:19:00.640
I can always call you
when I'm struggling, can't I?

00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:02.892
Your best friend
in the world, huh?

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:04.560
Huh?

00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:07.396
Everything okay, Rika?

00:19:07.438 --> 00:19:09.023
Oh, yes.

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:11.442
Forgive my wandering attention.

00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:16.489
[SATOKO] Surely this can only
be taken as an act of betrayal.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.616
Right, Rika?

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:25.998
[STUDENT B]
Good tidings.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.708
Good tidings to you.

00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:34.757
[STUDENT B]
Good tidings to you, Lady Rika!

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.092
[RIKA]
Good tidings to you.

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:38.219
[STUDENT D]
Ms. Rika, good tidings to you!

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.262
Good tidings to you.

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:50.398
Morning, Rika.

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:51.565
Satoko.

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:53.317
I'm your best friend
in the world.

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:55.361
Why don't I get a
"good tidings"?

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:57.071
It's almost as if you
just tell everybody

00:19:57.113 --> 00:20:01.200
what they want to hear,
like a dirty liar.

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:04.161
It's good to see you, Satoko.

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:05.830
Please, Rika.
You've troubled yourself

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:07.665
more than enough over this girl.

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:10.960
Excuse me, this conversation
is between me and Rika.

00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:13.796
Not you uptight hussies
in lady's clothing.

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:16.590
Your vulgarity is not
impressing anyone here!

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:17.842
You should be ashamed.

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.176
You would never speak
to Rika this way

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:21.470
if you knew how much
she worries about you.

00:20:21.512 --> 00:20:23.013
[SATOKO]
Does she?

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:26.517
And do any of those worries
relate to the promise she broke?

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:32.189
You have no right
to accuse me of that.

00:20:35.693 --> 00:20:37.278
When your grades
first started to slip,

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:38.654
I offered to study with you

00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:40.573
until you got them
back on track.

00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:43.117
I saw you needed a hand,
and I reached out.

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:44.952
You slapped my hand away.

00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:46.078
You told me that we would be

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.081
overcoming these
challenges side by side.

00:20:49.123 --> 00:20:50.708
What you offered was friendship,

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.918
but when I needed you,
I only got pity.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.171
I have never pitied
you for a second,

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:56.380
and I expect it
would behoove you

00:20:56.422 --> 00:20:58.883
to stop pitying
yourself as well.

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:00.259
I don't believe
this conversation

00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:03.304
is going to accomplish
anything for us.

00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:05.222
[RIKA]
I'm inclined to agree.

00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:09.143
[SATOKO]
That's terribly sad.

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:10.895
I was hoping it would go better.

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:13.731
I wanted you to get it
right this time.

00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:19.737
[AUDIENCE gasps]

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:22.823
Get your hands
off her right now!

00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:24.575
Rika.

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:26.243
This takes me back.

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:29.330
I really did miss it.

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:31.248
Yeah, me too.

00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:34.960
[SATOKO]
Now then, let's begin.

00:21:35.002 --> 00:21:36.045
Huh?

00:21:36.086 --> 00:21:37.546
[SATOKO]
I learned my lesson.

00:21:37.588 --> 00:21:40.090
I won't fall for any
of your lies next time.

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:42.426
[gasps] What? "Next time?"

00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:44.762
So, good tidings to you.

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:47.640
My dear, traitorous, Rika.

00:22:10.246 --> 00:22:11.914
[STUDENT B]
No!

00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:13.749
[STUDENT D]
Ms. Rika!

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.807
[RIKA] Next time:
<i>Satokowashi‐hen</i>, Part Five.
