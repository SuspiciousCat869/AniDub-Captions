WEBVTT

00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:11.386
A dream?
Where's this coming from?

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:12.596
Not that I'm bothered,

00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:14.181
but after all the years
we've known each other,

00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:15.849
it seems rather sudden.

00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:19.061
I never brought it up, but I've
thought about it for a while,

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:20.729
about the kind of life
I want to live

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:23.649
once I can leave
Hinamizawa on my own.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.527
And I decided what
I want is something new.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:29.821
I'd like a life totally
different from the one I know.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.114
When I wake up,

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.574
I'll turn the page
on my calendar

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:34.618
knowing everything
the day has in store for me

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.828
will be a surprise.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.872
And the reality will
always be something more

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:40.874
than I could have imagined.

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:41.833
It'll be a world full of

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.796
wondrous, splendid,
unexpected things.

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:46.672
Of course.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.173
I'll need to get into
the kind of school

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:50.092
where I can live that life,

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:53.554
and obviously, I want my best
friend to be there at my side.

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.264
Basically, I wanna go
live the high life

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.891
with you at a fancy
boarding school, Satoko!

00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.560
Ni‐paa!

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:00.727
Well, it's hardly a mystery

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.521
why you would want
a change of scenery after

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:04.940
so many years in this village.

00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:06.358
And the fact that
our club's activities

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.194
have been utterly
defanged doesn't help.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.154
But really,

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:12.864
it's not healthy
to get preoccupied

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.659
with high school entrance exams
when they're years away.

00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:18.537
We still have all of
middle school ahead of us,

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.789
so do you plan on spending
that whole time worrying

00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:23.250
about what you'll score
on a test at the very end?

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:24.293
You're only saying that

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:27.296
because you hate the idea of
studying for entrance exams.

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:29.464
Even the very thought of
having to study gives you

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:32.092
a great big headache,
doesn't it, Satoko?

00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:36.096
[SATOKO] Wha...? That is a
complete mischaracterization!

00:01:36.138 --> 00:01:38.348
I have excellent study skills,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.602
and when a subject interests me,
I'm more than happy to use them,

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:43.437
and we both know
that you hate studying

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:45.564
more than anyone on the planet.

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:47.899
I'm not going
to bother denying it.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.153
I've always hated studying,
and that hasn't changed at all.

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.195
But then,

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:54.531
I've never had the chance
to leave Hinamizawa,

00:01:54.573 --> 00:01:56.825
and until now, I felt like
I couldn't tell anybody

00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:58.910
I was thinking about it.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.078
Wow, Rika.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.164
[RIKA]
So I'm going to slog through it.

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:05.250
I have to, if I want
to make my dream come true.

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:06.877
And if there's a way,

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:11.590
I really want you to be a part
of that dream too, Satoko.

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:16.386
It looks like that
stubborn streak of yours

00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:18.513
is coming out again.

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.060
Fine, then, I'm with you.

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.270
Let's get into your
fancy‐pants school.

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:26.855
[RIKA]
You really mean it?

00:02:26.897 --> 00:02:28.565
I can't promise that
I'll be able to keep up

00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:30.901
with you all the way through.
Though honestly,

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:33.779
I expect you to reach your
breaking point before I do.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.238
I'm gonna prove you wrong.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.033
Nothing can stop me
from going to that school!

00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:40.744
Go, fight, win,
and all that stuff!

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.628
[KEIICHI]
Face forward! Bow!

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.589
[CLASS]
Bye!

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:56.677
Oh! I know we have club
and everything, but what if‐‐

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.178
[RIKA]
Chie.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.973
Yes, what is it I can do
for you, Ms. Furude?

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.309
Can we look at this problem?

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.605
Problems like
this can be intimidating,

00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:10.899
but they're not half
as hard as they look.

00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:12.943
This is the formula
you need to apply.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.654
That girl is going
to stunt her growth

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:19.157
with all this extra studying
she's subjecting herself to.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.410
Oh, hey. What's with Rika?

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.578
She's studying
for entrance exams.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.413
But why?

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.832
You two just started your
first year of middle school!

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.084
That's exactly what I said, too.

00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:31.128
What school is
she going to shoot for?

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.589
The one Mion goes to
in Okinomiya, I guess?

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.055
[RENA]
St. Lucia Academy. Hmm...

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:42.931
I could almost swear

00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:44.933
I've heard that name
somewhere before.

00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:45.809
[KEIICHI]
Oh yeah!

00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:48.562
I'm pretty sure that's where
Shion goes to school, isn't it?

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.230
[RIKA]
That's exactly right.

00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:53.525
A high‐end boarding school
for well‐to‐do young ladies.

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:56.820
And you're about as ladylike
as any girl I've ever met, Rika!

00:03:56.862 --> 00:03:57.738
Awoo!

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.323
And all the buildings
on campus look so cute!

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:01.616
Seeing the architecture

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.077
is what made me fall
in love with this school.

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:06.246
But tuition's really high.

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:09.458
Don't you need, like,
Sonozaki money to enroll there?

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.084
[RIKA]
I talked about it with Irie.

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:14.463
He said he could cover all
the expenses for me and Satoko.

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:17.549
Heh heh... Good luck then,
Coach's bank account.

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:20.218
‐‐Good luck.
‐‐Wait! You're going there too?

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.221
Yes, well. I'm not convinced
St. Lucia will be a fit for me,

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.849
but Rika will be
devastated if I don't.

00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:27.267
We'll see if they
can win me over

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:29.186
by the time I pass their test.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:30.979
I think you're assuming
some things there

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:32.439
that might not be true.

00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:34.691
For starters, you gotta
place crazy high to get in.

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:36.568
[chortles]

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.236
I could walk into
their exam in my sleep

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.655
and then walk out
with a perfect score!

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:43.950
You guys,
I've been dreaming of

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.994
getting into
St. Lucia for years.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:47.245
I need this.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.580
If you've got time,

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:51.875
I was hoping I could ask the
two of you to help me study.

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:53.835
Of course we'll
help you out, Rika!

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:55.128
If you ever have a question,

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.130
we're happy to work
through it with you.

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.133
It feels like a lot to ask.

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:02.010
You two have already
done so much for me,

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:03.762
along with everyone else.

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:05.263
Don't worry about it!

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.474
It's fine.
My old school was really tough.

00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:10.811
If you wanna ace this exam,
just leave it to me!

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.813
[RIKA]
Thank you so much!

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:15.524
And we'll be working
your brain over too, Satoko!

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.484
[SATOKO] My brain is just
fine exactly the way it is,

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:18.610
thank you!

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:19.569
And to celebrate,

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:21.530
let's kick off our club
activities for today

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.406
with an Endless
English Word Chain!

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:24.699
Yeah!

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.868
Yeah! Let's do this!

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.787
[KEIICHI]
Okay, let's get started!

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.832
Suddenly, she loves studying.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:34.251
So how long do
we see this lasting?

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.308
[SATOKO]
Rika?

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.361
[SATOKO]
Are you in the bathroom?

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.537
Huh?

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:22.507
[SATOKO]
Rika?

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:23.508
[RIKA]
Huh?

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.759
Did I wake you up?

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:25.677
At least I know why

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:28.471
you've been missing
so much sleep lately.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:33.977
[SATOKO] But why would
you want to keep it from me?

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:35.520
We're aiming to get
into the same school,

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:37.981
so it makes sense
for us to work together!

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:39.608
Mii.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:40.817
It was because
I knew the pressure

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:43.570
would be on once you
started taking it seriously!

00:06:43.612 --> 00:06:45.322
[chortles]

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:46.573
I'll stop holding back

00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:48.867
when it starts to look
like a competition!

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:50.744
And now the real game begins!

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:52.287
Ni‐paa!

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:31.636
[RIKA]
Satoko.

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:33.430
The moment of truth is here.

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:34.973
Ready to go?

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:36.933
[SATOKO]
Hold on just a second.

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:39.769
Getting there sooner will hardly
make a difference, will it?

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:42.313
[RIKA]
No, but I can't stand waiting
anymore!

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.315
[SATOKO]
Hey, easy, Rika!

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.761
So the day has finally come.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:15.180
You did bring your charm
from the shrine, right?

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.307
[SATOKO] The results
were up before we got here.

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:20.935
I don't see how good
fortune will help us now.

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:25.106
That's true, but it wouldn't
have hurt, would it?

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:26.274
It's okay.

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:28.359
We spent two and
a half years on this.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.653
We made it, without a doubt!

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.908
All right, now let's go find
your number on that board.

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:36.242
Come on!

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:44.834
I made it!

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:04.437
Are you up there?

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.150
I'm so proud of you, Rika!

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:10.652
And if that sounded
like surprise,

00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:12.570
I assure you it was
pure excitement.

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.781
You're fine, I know
what you're saying.

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:17.200
So now we just need
to go look for your number.

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:20.245
Uh! Hey, Rika.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.330
Not that I'm worried, but...

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:24.749
Huh?

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:28.128
Hypothetically, if I don't
get in, and you did.

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:30.380
I suppose all our years of
seeing each other in class

00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:32.632
every day will come
to an end here.

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:35.218
But they won't! You worked
way too hard for that!

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.428
Yeah. I did, didn't I?

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.805
And I certainly
wouldn't stand for you

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:40.765
showing me up at the climax!

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.600
Exactly, that's the spirit!

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:43.977
[chortles]

00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:46.354
I'm gonna go find my number!

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.028
No way I came up short.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.656
I worked myself half
to death getting here.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.784
I truly despise studying,

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:03.538
but I still held on through all
the long days and late nights.

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:12.297
That hurt less than the thought
of not being with Rika.

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:13.882
[gasps]

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.510
No way.

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.554
[RIKA]
Satoko?

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.107
Looks like we're classmates.

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:45.955
[PRINCIPAL]
We at St. Lucia Academy seek

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:48.750
to cultivate excellence
in our students.

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:51.085
Not only in terms
of academic ability,

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:53.963
but also in etiquette,
taste, and poise.

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:57.133
In short, our mission is to
train up all of you in this room

00:11:57.175 --> 00:12:00.553
into the finest women
your generation has to offer.

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:02.805
And as students
of this institution,

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:05.725
you are expected to uphold
our values at all times,

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.518
on campus and among the public.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.562
As you each entrust
your potential to us,

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:13.149
we entrust the good name
of St. Lucia Academy to you.

00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:16.819
Is there no quicker way
to tell us all this?

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:19.155
Are we starting the year
with an endurance test?

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:21.699
Bear with it.
You can't check out yet.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.953
[SATOKO] That speech
could have killed me!

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:27.956
Derailing that droning mess
with a trap five minutes in

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.583
would have been considered
justified self‐defense.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:34.587
[RIKA chuckles]
Poor, poor, pitiful Satoko.

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:37.006
[SATOKO] I wish Keiichi
could have been our principal.

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:38.258
He could give a
speech that people

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:40.260
would listen to by choice.

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:43.096
We're a little spoiled after
knowing Keiichi so long.

00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:45.640
We might need to
lower our expectations.

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:46.975
Good tidings.

00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:48.768
Good tidings to you.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:56.067
People honestly
say that in real life?

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:01.406
This seems like a good time to
get settled into my dorm room.

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:03.449
[SATOKO] Yes, I should
probably do the same,

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.034
though I do wish they
could've put both of us

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:06.911
in the same dorm room.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:09.080
It's okay.
We're in the same class!

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:12.750
That's true. Perhaps
I really am asking for too much.

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.003
Anyway, I'll see
you tomorrow, Rika.

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:17.005
You too. Have a good day.

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:22.468
Good tidings.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.595
[RIKA]
Good tidings.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:25.430
Only the first day,

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:28.016
and she's got them
thinking she's one of them.

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:55.752
Hey, Rika, did you sleep well?

00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:57.003
[TEACHER]
Everyone, be seated.

00:13:57.045 --> 00:14:00.965
Once the bell rings, your
personal conversations are over.

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:35.291
Ms. Rika Furude.

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:38.419
If you'd kindly lead the
class in adjourning for today.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.102
[RIKA]
Please stand. Bow.

00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:56.521
[CLASSROOM]
Thank you very much, ma'am.

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:02.318
I never realized
just how exhausting

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.362
going to school could be.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.993
Pardon me, but you're so pretty

00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:13.121
I just had to say
something, Rika!

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:14.497
If you're available,

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:17.708
we'd love it if you'd
join us in the parlor for tea.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.668
Really?

00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:19.836
Yes, certainly.

00:15:19.877 --> 00:15:22.630
I can't wait for the
older girls to meet you.

00:15:22.672 --> 00:15:25.216
Think of it as an
introduction to high society.

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:27.093
Please join us!

00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:31.931
If you're after my approval,

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:35.101
sure; the experience
will serve you well.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.687
Sounds good!

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.231
If you're quite sure.

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.774
I have no doubt.

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:44.235
Well then. Let us be off.

00:15:46.487 --> 00:15:47.947
Won't you come along?

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:49.824
I do appreciate you asking.

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:53.453
But really, that sounds
unbearably stuffy.

00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:55.788
Bye, then.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:56.956
If you enjoy a good debate,

00:15:56.998 --> 00:16:00.626
I would love to hear your
rhetorical abilities in action!

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:07.133
We came here for
the sake of her dream.

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.677
It's not my place to interfere.

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:12.388
In any case,
I'm sure it won't take long

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.349
for all this surface‐level
sheen to wear thin.

00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:26.611
[RIKA]
And so we're led to believe

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:29.739
that we're not really able
to alter our outcomes.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.283
Though something
compels us to try.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.160
A part of us
understands that the dice

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:36.704
will land however they will.

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:38.706
And that understanding
is what I refer to

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:40.917
when I speak of fate.

00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:44.420
The way these insights
come pouring out of you,

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:47.507
I'll learn as much during
afternoon tea as I do in class!

00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:50.760
You might be the most
engaging speaker I've ever met.

00:16:50.801 --> 00:16:53.930
I keep having to remind myself
that we're the same age.

00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:03.356
[TEACHER]
Ms. Hojo.

00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:16.827
[GIRL D]
Rika?

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:17.662
Huh?

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:19.413
[GIRL D]
Is everything okay?

00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:20.456
Of course.

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:21.999
I'm fine.

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:28.881
Starting tomorrow, you will need

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:32.051
to attend a study period
each day after class.

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:34.095
Really?

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:36.806
You're trying to tell me
I need to study even more?

00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:38.683
In spite of your
feigned indignation,

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.226
you already knew that.

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:42.228
Your entrance exam
score told us one story,

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.938
but your grades tell another.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.523
You'll have to fix it.

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:49.026
I went through
so much to get here.

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:51.070
I worked myself half to death!

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:52.363
And that's not enough?

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:55.533
Now you're telling me
to do it all over again?

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:57.201
You may have misunderstood.

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:59.704
No one is going
to force you to attend.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.207
So you're only telling
me what my options are?

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:04.333
Yes.

00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:07.253
In that case, I respectfully
decline your offer.

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:08.921
I can hardly think
of anything I'd‐‐

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:11.215
Of course.
Your other option is simple.

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.634
You may submit your
formal notice of withdrawal.

00:18:13.676 --> 00:18:16.387
Huh? Withdrawal?

00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:18.055
These are your options.

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:20.558
If that's clear,
we await your decision.

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:42.246
[RIKA]
Satoko?

00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:45.333
[SATOKO]
Is something the matter?

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:49.754
No, but you would
ask me for help,

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:53.257
if ever the need should
arise, wouldn't you?

00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:00.348
[chortles]

00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:02.642
That's taking the
joke too far, Rika.

00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:05.353
You'd be foolish to assume my
day ends after the final bell,

00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:07.355
any more than yours does.

00:19:07.396 --> 00:19:09.315
Pardon me, dear!

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.694
The way that girl laughs.
It's just vulgar.

00:19:13.736 --> 00:19:16.155
I don't understand how
someone as coarse as that

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:18.282
could even gain
admission to this school.

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:22.370
[GIRL B] Well, in any case,
shall we head for the parlor?

00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:27.249
Sure.

00:20:18.509 --> 00:20:21.971
And I really have to come here
every day from now on?

00:20:22.012 --> 00:20:25.057
[STUDY HALL GIRL]
Hey. Are you a first year?

00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:26.517
I am. Why?

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:27.435
That's good.

00:20:27.476 --> 00:20:29.061
You still have time.

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:32.148
There's a chance you can keep
your seat in the regular class.

00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:34.817
Not like most of
the girls in here.

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:39.739
Everything the Academy does
is to enhance its reputation.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.700
If you're not somebody they
want as part of their legacy,

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:45.286
they don't let you graduate.

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:46.871
The rich girls can't drop out

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:50.833
because all their families'
expectations are riding on them.

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:53.002
And the rest of us would be
leaving our parents bankrupt

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:54.962
with nothing to show for it.

00:20:55.004 --> 00:20:57.506
So we're all trapped here.

00:20:57.548 --> 00:21:00.342
It's hard to pull yourself up
if you fall out early on.

00:21:00.384 --> 00:21:01.635
You wind up studying endlessly

00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:04.430
just for the chance
to stay here.

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:06.265
Don't let that happen to you.

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:08.851
Get your grades up
before the end of the year.

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:10.770
If you can't,
starting next year,

00:21:10.853 --> 00:21:14.398
you'll be joining these girls
in the special class.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.692
What is the special class?

00:21:16.734 --> 00:21:17.985
[STUDY HALL GIRL]
Put it this way.

00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:20.070
If you drop out of
the regular class,

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:23.240
you can say goodbye
to what free time you have.

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:33.209
[cicadas crying]

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:48.933
Rika.

00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:52.061
Do you remember what
you said to me back then?

00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:58.317
[cicadas crying]

00:21:58.359 --> 00:22:00.277
You wanted a
glamorous school life

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:02.363
with your best
friend at your side.

00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:04.532
