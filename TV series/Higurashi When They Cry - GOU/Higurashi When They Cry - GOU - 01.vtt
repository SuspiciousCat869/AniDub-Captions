Huh?

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:50.652
Is there something wrong?

00:01:50.694 --> 00:01:54.781
Oh, no.
Everything's fine! Ni‐pa!

00:01:58.327 --> 00:02:00.120
[AIKO] Ever since
we moved to Hinamizawa,

00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:02.205
you haven't skipped
a single breakfast.

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.249
I'm so proud of you.

00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:10.964
[AIKO] Ah. Won't Rena be out
there waiting for you by now?

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:16.887
Thanks for breakfast!

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:18.680
Have a good day!

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:24.269
Yay, you're here!

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.146
Good morning, Keiichi!

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:28.398
You don't always have
to get here so early.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.234
It's okay to sleep
in now and then.

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.738
Well, I wouldn't wanna
make you wait for me.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.989
[KEIICHI]
Who said I would?

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:37.115
Ah?!

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.242
But I wait for you every day!

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.912
I know you do,
but I'd still ditch you.

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:45.957
Jeez, you're always
so mean to me, always!

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.959
Kidding. I would
never leave you.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.671
Ah! Oh. Thanks, Keiichi.

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:53.465
No matter how long it
took for you to show up.

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:54.508
I'd be waiting.

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.718
Huh? Really?

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.637
No matter how long...?

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:00.555
Awww.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.104
Ah. They're here.

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:08.980
Hey! Get a move on!

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:11.775
Like you don't make people
wait for you all the time!

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:14.111
Hey, Mion!
Sorry we took so long!

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:16.780
[MION] Mornin',
Rena, and look who it is!

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:18.156
Haven't seen you in years.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.241
How long's it been, Kei?

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:21.201
[KEIICHI]
Only two days, ya goofball.

00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:23.745
[laughs]
Well, it seemed longer.

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:25.997
Anyway, did you get
to have fun back home?

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.500
I was there for a funeral,
not a vacation.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:30.210
I had no free time, so...

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:30.961
Oh yeah!

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:32.838
That board game catalog.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.840
You remembered
to find it, didn't you?

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.508
[KEIICHI] Hey,
were you even listening to me?

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.219
Which part of "no free time"
did you not understand?

00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:41.263
‐‐[MION] Awww!
‐‐[RENA giggles]

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:49.271
[MION]
Oh?!

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:50.230
Oh, I see.

00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:52.816
[laughs]

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:54.735
[KEIICHI]
Hmph.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:57.195
So you're gonna put
my skills to the test, huh?

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.406
What skills? I don't get it.

00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:00.490
It must have been her.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:01.700
Stay back!

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:03.201
Huh? By her you mean...

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.369
[KEIICHI]
Look!

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:07.038
You're not even trying
to hide it, Satoko Hojo!

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.958
Ah. So I
guess the game is on today.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.334
And just you wait.

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.462
We both know there's
more to it than that.

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.422
This little trick
is nothing for her.

00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:18.049
It's just a dusty
old blackboard eraser, right?

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.427
It's not full
of rocks or anything.

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:22.220
Yeah, no way that
thing leaves a mark

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:25.223
like the one she hit you with
your first day of school here.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.100
Well, since you noticed it,

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:29.436
you could just open the door
and just let it drop, right?

00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:32.564
Of course, and that's
what she wants me to do!

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:34.649
The eraser is a red herring!

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.610
Observe!

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:45.535
And that's the trap.

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:50.123
[KEIICHI]
Hmph.

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:53.919
[cries out]

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:00.759
Ow.

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:02.844
[SATOKO]
Now what have we here?

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:06.306
You're off to an early start,
aren't you, Keiichi?

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.308
How long can you
keep up the pace?

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.227
[KEIICHI]
I have to admit, Satoko,

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:12.854
you really put a lot of
thought into that setup.

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:14.606
And what setup would that be?

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:15.857
I'm afraid I don't follow.

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:17.192
Why, you little...!

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:26.201
May all of your
pain fade gently away.

00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:29.454
Awoo. It's so nice
to see you, Rika!

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.706
A good morning to you too, Rena.

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:34.084
And to all of
my other friends as well!

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:37.128
[KEIICHI] You're always
such a sweetheart, Rika.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.922
Unlike someone else I know.

00:05:38.964 --> 00:05:40.507
What you're saying is slander.

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:42.092
You haven't proved a thing.

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:44.761
Don't you lie!

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:47.639
This finger can split
a plywood board in half!

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:48.598
You brute!

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.892
What kind of monster
threatens a little girl?

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:52.310
Easy. I was kidding!

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.603
Come on!

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.985
[sobs]

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.279
There, there. Don't cry, Satoko!

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.239
You gave it all you had!

00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:04.948
And next time,

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.033
I know you'll come up
with a trap so perfect

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:10.704
that even Keiichi
won't see it coming! Ni‐pa!

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.205
Don't encourage her.

00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:14.958
Awoo! Look at Satoko crying.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.045
She's so kyute, I wanna
take her home with me!

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:21.673
Please don't do that.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.761
I'm really sorry about cuttin'
into your Sunday like this, Kei.

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:30.015
Hey, don't apologize for giving
me a free tour of Hinamizawa.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.225
Honestly, I should be
paying you for your time.

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:34.769
By the way, have you
seen Rena around?

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.897
It's not like her
to be this late.

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:38.607
She said she wanted
to make you lunch,

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.025
so I bet she's
going full throttle

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.526
in the kitchen right now.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.987
Although, let's hope not.

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:46.990
[RENA]
Sorry I'm late!

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.284
[MION]
You really gonna make her carry

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:50.869
all that food she made for you?

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:52.245
That's a good point.

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:55.457
I'll take care of this,
because I'm a man!

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:58.293
Uh. Wait, what are you
going to take care of?

00:06:58.335 --> 00:06:59.961
What is it?

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.617
[RENA]
Isn't it beautiful?

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:32.327
This is the Furude Shrine!

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:36.498
[MION] They're gonna be holding
a big festival here next Sunday.

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.083
What, already?

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.752
It seems kind of early
for a summer festival.

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:42.879
Yeah, but the Watanagashi
festival is really

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:45.757
to celebrate the end of winter.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.107
Please enjoy, everyone!

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.234
Hey. You'd better
clear your plate.

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:06.653
Don't even think
about making Rena cry.

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:07.529
[KEIICHI]
Mm!

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.198
I'll do my best,
because I am a man!

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.908
But that's a whole lotta food.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.535
[SATOKO] And what do
you all think you're doing?

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:15.120
‐‐Huh?
‐‐Huh?

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.416
Hello, everybody!

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:21.543
[KEIICHI]
Hmm?

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.586
We were just about to
dig into this delicious meal

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:24.629
that Rena made.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:27.257
Yes, I understand what
a picnic is, thank you!

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:28.842
What I don't get
is why you think

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:30.552
you can have
one on our property!

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:32.762
Actually, I know
we can have one here.

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:34.556
Shrines are public places.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.433
Well, Keiichi
is right about that.

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.476
Anybody can have a picnic here.

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:39.644
[KEIICHI]
Hmm?

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.938
Honestly,
isn't Rika the sweetest?

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.189
Have a seat.

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.607
You can eat too!

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:46.151
Thank you all very much!

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.068
You ungrateful peasant!

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.362
Would you honestly
have me eat standing up?

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:52.574
Hey, I don't think anybody
said we were gonna feed you.

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:53.950
It's okay, Satoko.

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:56.036
Feel free to sit down
anywhere you'd like.

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:58.163
Nope! We're about to run out.

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:03.293
[cries] Rika!

00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:05.295
Here are your chopsticks!

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:11.468
Honestly, Kei.

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:13.803
How do you rope people
into things like that?

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:15.805
The rest of us will need
to pick up the pace,

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:18.224
or else these two are going
to finish the whole basket!

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:19.893
Yeah, you sure got that right!

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:22.645
Us old farts are gonna
have to get in quick!

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:25.940
[KEIICHI]
Gotcha!

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.402
Hey, elbows are illegal!

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:31.029
[SATOKO snickers]

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:33.323
[laughs]

00:09:33.364 --> 00:09:35.950
Good effort, but this
Hamburg steak is mine!

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:39.621
It's not over, Satoko Hojo!

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:42.582
Ah! You took all the meatballs!

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:44.167
No, they're right
here in my mouth,

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:45.960
plump and seasoned
to perfection!

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:47.087
Is that so?

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:48.755
Then this one is mine!

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:53.968
The perfect <i>tamagoyaki</i>!

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:55.637
[KEIICHI]
But honestly,

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:57.222
everything Rena
makes is perfect!

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:58.556
[SATOKO]
This is so good!

00:09:58.598 --> 00:09:59.390
[RIKA]
It's delicious!

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.975
[KEIICHI]
This is the best.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:04.270
[laughter]

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:12.237
Bye, guys!
I'll see ya tomorrow.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.863
[KEIICHI] Thanks for
showing me around today.

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:15.907
[RENA]
Bye, Mion!

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.284
Thank you for hanging out
with me, today.

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:19.577
Did you have fun?

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.037
[KEIICHI]
Yeah, it was great!

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:23.456
I'm kinda bummed
we're all going home now.

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.834
Well, if you don't mind,

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.794
could we make a
quick stop, could we?

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:30.004
Sure, but where?

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:39.973
[RENA hums]

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:44.310
[cicadas cry]

00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:51.484
[RENA] Ahhh! What are we gonna
find; what are we gonna find?!

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:54.904
Oop! Oof! Oh! Oof!

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:57.949
[sighs] So you wanted to
come play on a pile of trash?

00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:59.075
[RENA]
It's not trash!

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.619
To me it's a big mountain
of lost treasure!

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:02.328
Oh my gosh.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.038
I hope I find something kyute.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.416
My heart is going
all pitter‐pattery!

00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:08.042
[KEIICHI]
Hey, wait a sec!

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:13.506
[RENA] It's okay, Keiichi,
you can just wait there!

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:14.966
[KEIICHI]
Come on.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.567
[gasps]

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:34.485
Whoa, you scared
me there, buddy.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.279
[KEIICHI]
What? You scared me!

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:37.322
My bad.

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:39.407
It wasn't my intention
to spook you.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:41.534
So you live here in Hinamizawa?

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:45.079
The name is Tomitake.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:46.873
I'm a freelance photographer.

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:49.417
I like to come and
visit here now and then.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:52.879
There's just so much natural
beauty to capture out here.

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:55.590
If it's your job,
you should know better than

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:58.134
to take someone's picture
without their permission, right?

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:01.095
Oh, no, I'm actually just here
to take pictures of birds.

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.056
They never seem
to mind being on film.

00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:06.100
[laughs]

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:09.687
[RENA]
Hey, Keiichi!

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.940
Sorry to keep you
waiting up there.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.067
I'm ready to go
whenever you are!

00:12:14.108 --> 00:12:16.444
[TOMITAKE] So you came out
here with a friend.

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:21.157
Any idea why she'd wanna
hang out in a place like this?

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:22.325
Not really.

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:24.244
Maybe she's here
looking for pieces

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.704
of a dismembered corpse
or something like that.

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:31.251
Uh. Heh. Just kidding,
I have no clue.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.796
It really was awful.

00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:37.465
Rumor is, there's still
an arm missing.

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:38.800
[gasps]

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:45.181
[cicadas cry]

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.980
Hold on. Was there‐‐

00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:54.941
Ahhh... I'm done.
Thanks for waiting!

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:57.694
Sorry for taking so long.

00:12:57.735 --> 00:12:59.362
Good evening.

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:01.489
Evening. Well then,

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:04.367
I wouldn't want to impose,
so I'll be on my way.

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:07.287
I'm sorry for the unwelcome
surprise, Keiichi.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.456
You okay?

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:12.583
Uh! Uh, so...

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.294
Did you find some
buried treasure?

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:17.505
Mm. There's a Kenta‐<i>kun</i>
statue in there!

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:19.549
Kenta‐<i>kun</i>. Hey, wait.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.009
The guy in
the white suit you see

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.219
in front of that place
with the fried chicken buckets?

00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:27.098
Yeah, exactly! Awoo! So kyute!

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.225
I wanna take him home!

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.102
[KEIICHI] Hm?
You probably can if you want.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:32.520
He is in the garbage.

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:35.273
[RENA sighs]
I know, and I'd really like to,

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.317
but he's all the way
at the bottom of the pile,

00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:39.569
and it's gonna be
dark pretty soon.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.988
Let's come back and
dig him out together sometime.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.907
I feel like I owe you one
for that awesome lunch you made.

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.868
Huh...? Thank you!

00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:49.704
I'm so glad you're
gonna be helping me out.

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:52.623
I'm really gonna get
to take Kenta‐<i>kun</i> home with me!

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:54.000
Awoo!

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:57.420
It really was awful.

00:13:57.462 --> 00:13:58.546
[KEIICHI]
Hey, Rena.

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:01.174
Was there some big incident
in town a while back?

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:03.926
They were making plans
to build a dam around here.

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:05.261
Awoo!

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:07.180
Did something bad happen?

00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:09.140
Like at the building site.

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.601
Maybe an accident, or‐‐

00:14:11.642 --> 00:14:13.478
I don't know.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:16.230
[RENA] 'Cause it was
such a long time ago.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:18.441
I've only been in
Hinamizawa for a year.

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:21.152
[KEIICHI] Hmm? That means
you're a new transfer like me.

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:22.445
I never knew.

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:23.404
Uh‐huh.

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:26.157
And I don't really know
about stuff before that.

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:27.992
Sorry!

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:29.702
[KEIICHI]
Huh...

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:41.506
[MION]
All right!

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:43.216
Despite his dismal placement,

00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:45.551
our latest applicant
showed great promise

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.261
during his evaluation game.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:51.641
So I, Mion Sonozaki, now proudly
welcome our newest member.

00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:53.393
Keiichi Maebara!

00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:54.435
[KEIICHI]
Hmm.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:56.312
So, you ready to face the music?

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:57.230
[KEIICHI]
Now, hold on.

00:14:57.271 --> 00:14:59.232
Do all of you realize
how badly you embarrassed me

00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:02.485
after that ridiculous card game
you had me play last time?

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:04.654
You did lose,
so there was a penalty.

00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:06.072
Penalty?

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:08.157
Don't try to
play it off like that!

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:08.908
Mion!

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.035
You snuck a torture
device into the school.

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:13.079
You completely ruined my face!

00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:15.206
Torture device,
meaning this here?

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:16.374
Exactly right!

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:17.959
Don't you dare laugh, either!

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:19.168
Making me explain to Mom

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.003
why I'm washing permanent
marker off my face

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:23.506
should definitely count
as a form of torture!

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:26.426
There's no need
for melodrama, Keiichi.

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:30.471
[RIKA]
There, there, poor Keiichi.

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:32.974
Well, what's the
game gonna be today?

00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:35.935
More Old Geezer, or are
we moving on to Millionaire?

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.395
I don't think you're
ready to play cards

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.021
with the grown‐ups yet.

00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:42.942
Instead of that,
how about a scavenger hunt?

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:44.402
[KEIICHI]
Hmm...

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:49.574
Down here?

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:51.951
Come on already.

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:54.328
Where did Mion hide the thing?

00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:57.331
I'm gonna go hide this marker

00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:58.916
somewhere here in
the school building.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.961
Whichever one of you manages
to get hold of it wins the game.

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:03.796
Whatcha think? Sound good?

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:05.882
I guess that means
you're not gonna play.

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:07.467
How will the penalty game work?

00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:09.302
I made a special rule
that if you're the winner,

00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:11.387
I'll be the one
to pay the penalty.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:12.346
Then, you can take this sucker

00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:15.308
and draw whatever you like,
all over my face.

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:22.648
Just stay cool.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.859
You can do this, Keiichi!

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:25.985
I know Mion would hide it

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:29.155
where I'd be the least
likely to reach it first.

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:30.490
Since I'm the new guy,

00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:33.451
I'm betting she put it someplace
nobody's told me about.

00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:40.333
[gasps]

00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:41.125
Rena?

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.877
Keiichi.

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:45.713
I'm guessing you don't plan
on letting me win, do you?

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.924
As a club member, I can't.

00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:49.967
That's rule number two.

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:52.762
"Do all you can
to claim victory!"

00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:56.098
‐‐Excuse me!
‐‐Beg your pardon!

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:02.146
I don't think so!

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:12.532
Well, it would seem victory
is mine, eh, Rika?

00:17:12.573 --> 00:17:14.992
You were up against
my traps, after all.

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:17.161
No shame in losing to the best!

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:18.913
[chortles]

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:22.041
Satoko. Don't be a sore winner.

00:17:22.416 --> 00:17:24.043
It doesn't bother me at all.

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:27.129
That's just how it is
when you lose the game!

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:32.718
I even got you a present
to celebrate your victory!

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.804
I knew you would
understand, Rika!

00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:37.848
Congratulations, Satoko! Ni‐pa!

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.309
Ahh...

00:17:41.602 --> 00:17:44.146
[cries out]

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:48.818
[SATOKO] Wha‐‐ I don't
even know what happened!

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:49.819
Look in a mirror.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.404
You'll see.

00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:56.617
Ahh! There's ink on me!

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:58.286
I wanted to bring
a secret weapon,

00:17:58.327 --> 00:17:59.287
so I would have a good way

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:02.164
to counter all of
your traps. Ni‐pa!

00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:05.543
It's fine. There's
no shame in losing to Rika.

00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:10.590
Hm? Rena?

00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:13.926
[RENA] Sorry, I didn't realize
how tired I was getting.

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:16.095
Too much fun I guess.

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:18.222
[KEIICHI]
You okay?

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:20.850
I'm gonna stop in the
nurse's office before I leave.

00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:22.101
But Kenta‐<i>kun</i>...

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:23.728
No need to worry about that,

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:26.689
we'll go deal with him
whenever you're feeling better.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:37.825
And I suppose I'd
better go wash my face.

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:38.826
I'd be mortified if anyone

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:42.246
were to see me
like this out in public.

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:47.293
That's two gone.
Guess we're done.

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:51.964
[MION]
A Kenta‐<i>kun</i> statue?

00:18:52.006 --> 00:18:54.759
Yeah, I can definitely
see Rena wanting that.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.635
[KEIICHI]
Hey, Mion.

00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:57.637
I heard about the dam
they were gonna build.

00:18:57.678 --> 00:18:59.805
Did something happen
at the construction site?

00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:02.099
[MION]
Oh yeah, it was like a warzone.

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:04.268
The villagers staged
all kinds of protests

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.645
and sit‐ins and stuff.

00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:07.313
It was a big deal.

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:10.566
Well, all of your homes
were gonna end up underwater.

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:11.901
I can see why.

00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:14.695
The government was dead set
on pushing it through.

00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:17.239
They realized they
couldn't buy us off.

00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:19.075
Then things really got ugly.

00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:20.785
And you guys still won.

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:22.161
That's pretty impressive.

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:22.995
[MION]
The mayor of the town

00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:25.706
and the village leaders
brought petitions to Tokyo.

00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:28.334
They made a bunch of deals
with all the political types.

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:30.628
So in the end,
construction was cancelled.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.547
And that's how Hinamizawa
beat the national government.

00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:34.882
[chuckles]

00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:39.220
And it was all peaceful,
beginning to end.

00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:42.390
Nobody was assaulted? Or killed?

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.557
No one.

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:44.975
[gasps]

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:46.185
See ya tomorrow!

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:12.378
Huh? There she is.

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:16.882
Hey! Rena! Workin' up a sweat?

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.430
[RENA]
Keiichi? Why are you here?

00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:25.683
I received word of an emergency
and came as soon as I could!

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.643
Now take me to
the man who was trapped!

00:20:27.685 --> 00:20:29.770
[RENA] Huh?
Wait. Someone was trapped?

00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:30.563
Where?

00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:32.565
[KEIICHI] Yes, reports
describe a Kenta‐<i>kun</i> statue

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:34.650
buried deep inside
this garbage heap!

00:20:34.692 --> 00:20:37.027
Huh? Aww, come on.

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:38.946
I thought you
were being serious!

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:41.073
[KEIICHI laughs]
I'm just goofin' around.

00:20:41.115 --> 00:20:42.616
I promised I'd help, remember?

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.785
Huh?! You came for me?

00:20:44.827 --> 00:20:47.455
Awoo!

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:52.168
[KEIICHI]
So, where is that Kenta‐<i>kun</i> at?

00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:55.087
Uhh... This way!

00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:57.590
Right here,
under all this stuff.

00:20:57.631 --> 00:20:58.507
[KEIICHI]
Hmm?

00:20:58.549 --> 00:21:00.342
Were you really planning
to try and dig him out

00:21:00.384 --> 00:21:02.344
from under all that yourself?

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:04.180
Here, move over.

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.244
[KEIICHI pants]

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:29.789
Man, an axe or a
saw would be a big help.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.082
We don't need
to do it right now!

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:32.958
[KEIICHI]
Don't worry!

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.336
It's fine, I wanna do this.

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:42.343
But I could use a break first.

00:21:42.384 --> 00:21:44.053
Uh. Hold on,
I'll run home real quick

00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:45.930
and grab some cold barley tea!

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:47.598
My house is super close by!

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.433
Just sit tight, okay!

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:11.872
Rumor is, there's
still an arm missing.

00:22:29.765 --> 00:22:32.351
Hinamizawa.
Dam construction site.

00:22:32.393 --> 00:22:36.021
Worker lynched, murdered,
and... dismembered?!

00:22:36.814 --> 00:22:38.023
Then what he said...

00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:39.358
It's true!
