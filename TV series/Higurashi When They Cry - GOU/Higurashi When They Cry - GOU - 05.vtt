[phone rings]

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:19.394
Hello?

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.438
[RENA giggles]
Good morning, Keiichi!

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.898
Wake up, sleepyhead!

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.982
Wake up!

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:24.983
[KEIICHI]
Rena?

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.652
Why are you calling me so early?

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.904
[MION]
Good morning, Kei!

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:30.572
You too, Mion?

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:32.032
Another challenge?

00:00:32.074 --> 00:00:33.492
[MION]
Glad you're finally figuring out

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:35.369
how this club works, bud.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.539
We're gonna meet at the
usual spot before we head out.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.707
We'll be seeing you
there, right?

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:41.917
You bet you will!

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:44.086
And I'll hand you
your butt on a platter!

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.629
[RENA]
Keiichi!

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:47.548
What took you so long?

00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:50.634
Sorry about that, guys!

00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:03.647
[SATOKO]
You're finally here!

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:05.732
We've been waiting patiently!

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:06.525
Good morning.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:07.943
Glad to see you made it.

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:08.694
You too!

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.404
What's on the agenda today?

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:11.738
[KEIICHI]
Hold on.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.740
You mean this is where
we'll be having club?

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:15.409
Yeah, the shop sets up
tournaments now

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.912
and then to show off the
products and get new customers.

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:21.415
A tournament. So now you're
telling me I'm gonna be playing

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.667
against everybody else
in the whole shop?

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:24.918
Exactly.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.878
Today's club meeting is special,
'cause there's more

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.840
than just the five of us
competing this time around!

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.675
Special, huh?

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:34.094
I've got a lot more
people to beat now.

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:34.886
[MION]
Okay, guys.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.221
Listen up!

00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:38.724
We've got 15 players total.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.934
First, we draw numbers
out of a hat.

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:42.394
We'll split into
five groups of three,

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:44.896
and the winner of
each group will advance.

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:55.032
Oh, wow, can you guys believe

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:57.784
we managed to end up in
separate groups somehow?

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.077
Crazy.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.246
Honestly. You didn't
think I was gonna let

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:04.082
any of us get bumped off
in round one, right?

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.335
Heh. I have no idea
how you pulled that off,

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:08.795
but either way,
I'm ready to smoke someone!

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:11.006
All right, let's do it, Keiichi!

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:12.382
Okay, then.

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:14.343
I'll see you all in the finals!

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:16.762
I'll be doing
my best to win, too!

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:22.392
Oh hey.

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:24.478
We're in class together,
aren't we?

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.604
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:27.147
I'm Tomita.

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.815
Okamura.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:30.692
[KEIICHI] I can walk
right over these kids.

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:32.527
They're not even
gonna see it coming!

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.029
Good draw!

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:34.946
Okay, guys.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.991
If everybody's set up,
let's get our games started!

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:39.368
Here we go!

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.375
One, two, three, four.

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:49.586
Five thousand bucks each to
celebrate the birth of my child.

00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:51.254
Tough break, huh?

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.883
Bonus time. Get a
hundred grand from the bank!

00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:55.467
Wha...?

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:57.719
You already got
your money back already!

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.555
I'm on the corporate ladder!

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:03.308
[KEIICHI]
That's one of the best routes!

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.186
This whole game
completely depends on luck!

00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:07.729
How am I supposed
to improve my chances

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:10.482
when the game is just
spinning a roulette wheel?

00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:11.817
[GAMER A]
That's impossible!

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.110
[GAMER B]
What are you, psychic?

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.444
[SATOKO chortles]

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:16.071
Good game, boys.

00:03:16.113 --> 00:03:19.491
But in the end, victory is mine!

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.034
You've been outplayed.

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.703
Wha... Seriously?

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:24.538
You got through
your group already?

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.123
Well done, Satoko.

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.583
I see you've made
your way to the finals as well.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.503
No way, Mion too?
How'd that happen?

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:32.713
So that's dealt with.

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:35.215
What say we step out
for a cup of tea?

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:37.759
The others should be
done by the time we get back.

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:40.137
Ooh. Good idea!

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.933
Are you for real?

00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:46.768
So how's it going for Rena?

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.103
Okay, next card.

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:50.063
"Every dog has its day."

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:54.276
Awoo! It's so kyute!

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:55.777
I wanna take it home!

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.404
"A bird in hand is worth."

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:00.949
[YOSHIRO]
"A fool and his money are‐‐"

00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:02.033
"Do unto others as‐‐"

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.578
Awwo! I'm taking them home.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.079
They're so adorable!

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:07.497
Awoo!

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:08.373
[KEIICHI]
There's no way!

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.125
She never plays
that hard at anything,

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:11.835
so what's going on here?

00:04:11.877 --> 00:04:12.961
[gasps]

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:13.754
Oh come on.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.339
The cards flipped
her cute switch?

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:19.009
And Rika?

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.093
[RIKA]
Mii!

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.970
I got a fish, you guys!

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:22.971
That's awesome.

00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:24.598
You're great at this, Rika!

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.099
[RIKA]
Mii!

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:28.477
Oh my gosh,
I just got another one!

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:30.896
Wow, guess you've
totally mastered this game.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.147
There's no competing with you!

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:34.524
Yeah, you've got this!

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:35.442
[KEIICHI]
Amazing.

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:36.943
That's no competition.

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:40.197
She turned her game into
the Rika Furude Fan Club!

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.656
Whenever you're ready, Maebara.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.450
[KEIICHI]
Uh! Sorry, guys.

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:47.412
Here we go.

00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:51.541
Now I gotta pay a 50,000
dollar fine for tax evasion?

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:52.959
Something wrong, Keiichi?

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.961
Are you having a bad time?

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:55.712
Are you?

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:58.048
Everyone but you
won their games already.

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.257
[KEIICHI]
Dangit!

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:00.383
Mii.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.636
How much money
do you guys have right now?

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:06.723
I have, uh, 980,000
thousand dollars.

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:11.353
Uh, 880,000, and there's
still enough time to catch up!

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:14.064
Huh? They're both on track
to have well over a million

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:15.232
by the end of the game!

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:17.734
So, how's that account
balance lookin', Kei?

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:18.860
[KEIICHI]
Hey, shut up.

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:22.072
This game is pure luck
and I keep getting bad spins!

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.573
Save the excuses.

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:25.784
No giving up allowed, Keiichi!

00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:30.580
Keiichi. Don't worry about it.

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:31.498
[sighs]

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.958
All I'm doing
is spinning the wheel!

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.835
You think I'm missing
something, Mion?

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:35.919
Then tell me!

00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:37.587
Come on, really?

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:38.713
We were all playing to win,

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:41.216
but you've been
putting in no effort at all.

00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:43.134
Wh‐What does that even mean!

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:45.262
It wouldn't take ten seconds
to seal this game,

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:47.472
but I guess you don't wanna win.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:48.515
Let's go.

00:05:48.557 --> 00:05:51.810
Don't you think that
was a little harsh, Mion?

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:53.645
Damn it.

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.772
Don't act like I'm not trying!

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:57.023
It's a game of chance!

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.817
How do you figure
I could guarantee a win,

00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:01.027
let alone get it done
in ten seconds?

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.239
Am I destroying your hopes
and dreams with my crappy luck?

00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:07.200
So, uh, are we
gonna keep playing?

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:11.746
You can always forfeit if
you don't feel like finishing.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.374
Play to win, huh?

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:16.293
Fine then, let's go!

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.087
Here's a thought.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.298
What say we make a deal, boys?

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:22.507
You let me win.

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:24.092
‐‐What?
‐‐What?

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:27.304
Hey, hold on Maebara, using
threats is against the rules!

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:28.680
Just settle down for a sec.

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:30.599
Think about what
you're playing for here.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.600
The cash, right?

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.435
Well, yeah, obviously!

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:35.270
Let's say you win
this whole thing.

00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:37.480
What do you plan on
doing with the money?

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:39.441
What do you think
you'd spend it on?

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:40.984
I'd prob'ly buy a new game.

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:43.111
Snacks or soda I guess.

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:44.654
[chuckles]

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:45.614
Come on, fellas.

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.240
Ya gotta think big!

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.493
Okay? So what are
you gonna do with it

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:53.246
that's so much better than
what we would do with it?

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:54.539
I'm glad you asked.

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.583
Us club members are
playing for the prize too,

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:59.419
but we also face a penalty
for any game we lose!

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:00.587
And the winner is allowed

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:03.089
to determine the loser's
penalty without exception.

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:04.507
You're the only
club member here,

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.343
your punishment
is your problem.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:07.302
What does that have to do with‐‐

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:08.595
Hear me out.

00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:11.890
Tomita, you have a huge crush
on Satoko, don't you?

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:15.518
And you, Okamura,
you have the hots for Rika.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:19.522
Hah. Think what I can
do for you if I win.

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:22.734
Tomita, how do you feel about
Satoko wearing a collar,

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:26.196
playing your
little sister for a day?

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.324
[KEIICHI]
And Okamura.

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:31.201
Would you care
to take a leisurely stroll

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:33.286
with your new cat, Rika?

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:35.121
I can make it happen.

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:40.335
‐‐I could never ask for that.
‐‐Hold on, there's no way.

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:41.962
‐‐But I mean...
‐‐Sounds nice, but...

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.922
Easy now.
You're not in the club,

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:47.384
and it's not your fault if the
penalty I choose benefits you.

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:50.136
It's too late now for me to
escape a lonely teenhood.

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:51.638
but at least there's still hope

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.682
for the kids coming
up behind me!

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:54.474
Help me out here,

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:57.227
and I can offer you a prize
far greater than money!

00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:59.688
I swear it on my manly pride!

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.274
‐‐Thank you, Maebara!
‐‐Thank you, Maebara!

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.527
[TOMITA] I'll follow
you to hell and back!

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:08.697
[ALL 3]
That's the game!

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.115
So it's over?

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.741
Who won, Keiichi?

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.785
In the end, I claimed victory.

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:14.661
[shocked sounds]

00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:17.622
How did you pull it off after
that dismal beginning you had?

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.791
It's all about knowing
your opponents.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:21.001
Isn't that right?

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:22.544
‐‐Yeah!
‐‐Yeah!

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:26.798
So Keiichi does
have what it takes!

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.300
Heh! That was just
the preliminaries.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.720
No way I'm gonna be
the one to get knocked out!

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:34.556
Hmph. Guess you can
play to win after all.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.099
Good for you, Kei!

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:36.933
All right.

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:39.728
So what game are we gonna
play for the final round?

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:40.562
What game?

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:41.980
Yes, about that.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.444
See the thing is, my shift
is actually about to start.

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.112
‐‐[TOMITA] Why?
‐‐[OKAMURA] No!

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.616
[MION]
Sorry, everyone.

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:56.077
I'll make it up to you
next time, promise!

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:58.496
You kids made the shop
a lot of money today!

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.790
Here, take these
as a "thank you."

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:02.959
Hold on a minute.

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.252
I helped out too.

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:05.336
Where's mine?

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.839
I'll give you a big tip the
next time I see you at work.

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:09.632
[sighs]
Really?

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.009
Well hello there!

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:12.552
I got a new penguin friend!

00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:15.638
Oh my gosh can
I actually take this home?

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.141
So is mine cute too?

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:19.893
[RENA gasps]

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:21.686
It's so kyute!

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:22.854
[laughs]

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:23.646
What's wrong, Kei?

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:26.524
Don't you wanna take it home
and play house with it?

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.109
It is pretty cute, honestly.

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:30.320
Just not exactly what I'm into.

00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:32.822
And if you keep it, folks in
town are gonna start talking

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:34.908
about the weird kid
with the doll.

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:35.950
Good point.

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:39.204
This would be wasted on me.

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.206
Hmm...

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:44.042
Keiichi.

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:46.044
That could be a
good gift for someone.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:48.171
And if you give it out of the
goodness of your heart,

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:51.633
I know anybody here would
be happy to accept it!

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:55.386
You should have this, Mion.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.472
I think it suits
you much better.

00:09:57.514 --> 00:09:58.181
You what?

00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:01.226
Oh, no, I'm not really into
all that girly‐girl stuff!

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:03.394
Sometimes it's like I was
supposed to end up a guy,

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.980
but the wrong box got
checked or something!

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:08.691
Seriously, just take it!

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:11.236
Jeez. Thank you.

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.529
I think that's for the best.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.199
Keiichi may have won her,
but she's better off with you.

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:34.801
I'd say this food
isn't much different

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:36.886
from any other
family restaurant.

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:39.389
Nobody comes here
for the food, Keiichi.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.057
Just take a look.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.857
Excuse me! Could I get
another coffee here please?

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.234
'Kay. Be right there!

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:55.488
[ICHIRO hmms appreciatively]

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.616
Seriously? That's the
reason people come here?

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.326
[ICHIRO]
Be honest.

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.954
You do understand
the appeal, don't you?

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.415
Ow! That was
totally uncalled for.

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:07.500
Even my own
father never struck me!

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:09.335
Well, your own son just did!

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:12.338
Heh. Don't deny yourself, son.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.674
Look. I'm hittin' the john.

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:19.345
Take this moment to appreciate
the beauty on display.

00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:21.556
Dad, you are too old for this.

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.142
[????] Um, we apologize
for the delay, sir.

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:25.476
Here's your dessert.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:26.519
Cool, thanks.

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:27.979
Huh?!

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.403
Hey, Mion. What's up?

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:36.571
Uh, uh...

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:37.530
Mion?

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:38.573
It's you right?

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:41.326
This is the last job
I would expect you to have.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:45.038
Yes, well, because my uncle's
the owner and he needed help.

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:48.041
Gotta say, you don't look like
anybody checked the wrong box

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:49.500
when you're wearing
that uniform!

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.336
I can feel you staring at me.

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:53.296
Please, sir.
Show some discretion.

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:54.547
Come on, be real.

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.090
There's nothing wrong
with liking attention,

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:58.509
and you're gonna get it
for sure looking like that!

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.137
Ah! That is not why
I'm wearing this, sir!

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:04.057
And to be honest,
I didn't want to.

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:06.643
Oh man, to think I'd get
to see Mion in that outfit,

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:09.437
and that she would end up
looking crazy hot in it!

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:11.064
You're mistaken, sir!

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:12.398
Is that so?

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.399
What do you mean?

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.401
Sorry. The truth is,

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:20.198
my name is Shion Sonozaki,
sir, and I'm Mion's twin sister!

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.492
Shion? Shion Sonozaki.

00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:25.536
Yes, and you're far from the
first one to get us confused.

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:26.204
Hold on.

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:26.996
We've never met,

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:29.707
so why were you acting like
you already knew who I was?

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:31.501
Oh. Well, you see.

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:33.753
Mion does talk
about you quite a bit.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:36.631
You're not really expecting me
to believe that, are you?

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:38.591
It's the truth.

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:42.345
Okay. Shion, wasn't it?

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:45.014
I'll remember next time.
Sorry about that.

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:48.518
Ah! It's fine, I'm just
making sure you know.

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:49.560
I should've guessed.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:53.064
There's no way Mion could ever
pull off that kind of outfit.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:56.192
It honestly does look
amazing on you, though.

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:58.111
Really, you think so?

00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:01.072
Sonozaki. You can take
your break now if you'd like!

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:03.241
Uh, okay!

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:04.534
Right, well then.

00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:06.035
I'll take my leave.

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:08.955
It was a pleasure finally
getting to meet Kei in person!

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:11.541
Sorry for confusing you
with your sister.

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:17.588
[ICHIRO chuckles]
There he is.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.215
Is it starting to sink in?

00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:22.135
Are you catching on to why
everybody loves this place?

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:25.763
Huh. Yeah. Sure am.

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.397
I'm a growing boy, dammit.

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:36.232
I shouldn't be skipping lunch.

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:38.067
This is torture.

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:40.987
How did we turn making
curry into a competition?

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:44.365
And who knew Ms. Chie could
get so intense about curry?

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:47.577
[MION] Right, she's normally
all sweet and soft‐spoken.

00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:50.163
[RENA] Uh, are you
feeling all right, Keiichi?

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:52.332
I wish you could
have tried my curry.

00:13:52.373 --> 00:13:53.499
[KEIICHI]
Yeah, me too,

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:55.501
but after Satoko dumped
in that much salt,

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:57.587
it could have given me a stroke.

00:13:57.628 --> 00:13:58.588
Well, for what it's worth,

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:00.715
I'm impressed that you've
stayed upright this long.

00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:03.259
[KEIICHI] Kind words
won't do me any good here.

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:05.386
I need some food in me soon.

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:06.637
[laughs]

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.222
They say hunger
is the best spice,

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:11.684
so at least dinner
should be extra yummy!

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:14.854
[MION] I gotta head off to work
now, so I'll see you guys later.

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:15.772
Oh yeah.

00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:18.566
Waiting tables seems like it
would be a pretty tough job.

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:19.359
[gasps]

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.694
What? I never knew
you were a waitress, Mii.

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.071
You're really a waitress?

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:26.157
Where are you waitressing?
Where? Awoo!

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:27.158
I'm not though.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.285
I was just helping my uncle!

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:32.497
My uncle Yoshiro from
the game shop, remember!

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:35.500
Uh! My bad!
Shion was the waitress, right?

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:37.960
I got you mixed up
'cause you look so alike.

00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:40.463
[RENA]
Wait, Shion? Who's Shion?

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:41.798
You don't know her either?

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:43.966
Shion is Mion's twin sister!

00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:46.844
Their looks are identical, but
they could hardly be less alike!

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:48.262
Yeah, exactly.

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:49.430
We may have the same face,

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:51.808
but we've got
different personalities.

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:53.559
She and Mion
are pretty different.

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:57.355
Shion is really cute, and she's
got a super sweet smile too.

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:58.689
Just cut it out Kei!

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.441
Is that true? Is it?

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:01.651
I don't think I remember you

00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:03.986
ever mentioning
you had a sister before.

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:05.780
Uh... Yeah.

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:08.616
Come to think of it, I guess
you've never met her, Rena.

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:09.784
Whoa, I'm late.

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:12.120
I really gotta go, guys, see ya!

00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:18.376
It is weird, but I think
I'll go ahead and trust her.

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:20.169
Yeah, me too.

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.255
But she was all cute
and flustered though.

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:24.340
Why would she be all flustered?

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:27.385
[KEIICHI]
How long till dinner?

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:31.389
[groans]
Come on, Mom; I'm wasting away.

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:33.141
[doorbell dings]

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:35.101
The door is open.

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:39.272
[????]
Uh. Good evening.

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:42.191
Oh no. Are you okay?

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:43.818
Why are you on the floor?

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.364
[KEIICHI] Mion‐‐Wait, no,
you're Shion, right?

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:49.907
Why are you here?

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.242
[SHION]
I talked with my sister.

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:54.287
She told me you hadn't
been able to have lunch today.

00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:56.581
[KEIICHI]
Uh, yeah, I'm starving.

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:58.207
Why do you mention it?

00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:00.334
Did you bring me
food or something?

00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:02.003
Yes, I did, actually.

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:03.796
You know. Um.

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:05.673
As a thank you
gift for the doll.

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:06.507
Whoa!

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:08.926
You're saying you
really did bring food?

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.011
Hold on.

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:12.680
A thank you gift for
the doll I gave to Mion?

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:14.140
Um... Because she...

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:16.225
It wasn't far out of
the way for me to come,

00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:19.562
so I told her I would
bring it to you.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:21.981
But... I hope it's not a bother!

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:23.441
No, it's not a bother at all.

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:25.276
You're a life saver!

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:28.154
Well, I should
hurry on to work now. Bye.

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:28.905
And when you're finished,

00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:31.616
feel free to bring the
containers to my sister.

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:32.825
Great.

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:34.494
Thanks so much!

00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:39.540
So now I have some food
that came from Mion's house.

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:42.084
What kind of trap are
we dealing with here?

00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:44.128
Raw mustard or hot sauce?

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.424
That's good!

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:57.975
Thanks for the food.

00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.101
It was awesome.

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:01.938
[MION splutters]

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:08.069
Oh right.

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.112
I was home alone
last night and starving.

00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:12.448
Then Shion showed up
at my door all of a sudden

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:13.991
with a whole bunch of food.

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:16.118
She told me to bring
you the containers.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.870
I cleaned 'em out for you.

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:19.205
[laughs]

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:20.414
That Shion, right?

00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:22.291
She's such a thoughtful girl.

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:25.586
You certainly are in high
spirits today, Miss Mion!

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.004
I think it's cute.

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:28.714
She's showing her softer side.

00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:30.841
I'm just worried she
may have caught something.

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.593
I don't think it's anything
contagious,

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:35.429
but someday I'm sure
you'll catch it too, Satoko.

00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:37.974
You've completely lost me.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.650
Now that I've eaten all
I wanna do is take a nap.

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:48.734
So hey, Kei.

00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:51.279
You always eat all
your foods at lunch, right?

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.239
Like not a
single grain of rice left?

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.241
Well, someone took
the time to make it for me,

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:56.784
it wouldn't be
right to waste it.

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:58.369
It's kinda funny.

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:01.163
You come off as intense
and a bit of a loner.

00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:04.041
But you're so considerate;
you're a stand‐up guy!

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:05.042
I know, right?

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:06.168
He can look kinda scary,

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.838
but he's a real sweetheart
on the inside!

00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:11.173
Now it's starting to feel like
you're making fun of me.

00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:12.800
I'm not! I'm being serious!

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:13.676
What I'm saying is,

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:16.095
there's more to you than
what you see at first glance!

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:18.097
So what did you see at first
glance that was so bad?

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:19.932
[CHIE]
Miss Sonozaki. Mister Maebara.

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:21.767
We are in class!

00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:24.395
Honestly. Miss Sonozaki, notes?

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:25.938
Yes, ma'am.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.024
Never judge a book
by its cover, you know?

00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:31.569
Sometimes a person is the
total opposite of how they seem.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:34.113
Yeah? What about it?

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:36.115
Seems like you're going
somewhere with this.

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:37.867
[RENA]
Up until a little while ago,

00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:40.161
Satoko was a super
sweet, needy girl.

00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:42.788
[KEIICHI]
Sweet and needy? That goblin?

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.541
I can't even imagine what
that would have been like.

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:48.377
Though I will say there's more
to Rika than a cute face.

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:49.378
[RENA]
Whenever I look at her,

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:50.796
I can't help thinking
she's going to be

00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:53.674
a drop‐dead gorgeous woman when
she grows up, don't you think?

00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:54.717
Don't you?

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:56.218
And even if she
acts like she's not,

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.846
Mion's definitely
a girly‐girl at heart.

00:18:58.888 --> 00:18:59.555
Okay.

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:01.724
So how much did she pay you
to give me this speech?

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:04.226
It's 'cause she's so dedicated
to leading our club.

00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:06.979
She wants us all to see her
as someone we can follow.

00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:10.399
But when you get past that,
she's a cute girl on the inside!

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:14.695
But she'll always
do her best to hide it,

00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:16.572
so don't forget,
all right, Keiichi?

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:17.698
Got it.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.783
Now, what about you?

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:20.493
Huh? About me?

00:19:20.534 --> 00:19:22.995
I shouldn't judge folks
based on appearance, right?

00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:25.039
So, how does that
apply to you, Rena?

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:26.290
[laughs]

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:28.584
I'd need to know
how I seem to you.

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:30.836
So, how do I seem, so how?

00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:34.048
How does Rena Ryugu seem to me.

00:19:36.884 --> 00:19:39.095
She can take the joke
a bit far sometimes,

00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:40.805
but she still has a kind heart.

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:41.681
I guess basically

00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:43.891
she's everything you
could want in a girl.

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:46.519
Really, honestly?
Well thanks.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.396
That's really sweet.

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:52.566
[KEIICHI]
But if you're just the opposite.

00:19:54.485 --> 00:19:55.653
[MION]
Sorry, guys.

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:57.405
I have another shift today.

00:19:57.446 --> 00:19:58.531
That's no problem.

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:01.117
I actually had plans
of my own today, too.

00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:02.410
Oh, that's right.

00:20:02.451 --> 00:20:05.162
I forgot you had to
practice for Watanagashi.

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:07.748
Indeed, she does.
It's coming up this Sunday.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.584
Training for this is
no laughing matter.

00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:12.503
Is there some big
event happening?

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:14.422
Yeah, there's a local festival.

00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:15.423
It's Watanagashi,

00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:18.259
and we hold it at the shrine
on a Sunday each June.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.386
And Rika works there
as a shrine maiden,

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:22.763
so she'll be performing
the ritual dance!

00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:25.975
"Watanagashi" seems like kind
of a weird name for a festival.

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.435
It means "cotton drifting."

00:20:27.476 --> 00:20:30.229
We drift stuffing from
old futons down the river.

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:33.607
It's kinda like a big memorial
service for futons.

00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:34.900
Interesting.

00:20:34.942 --> 00:20:37.027
Well, we should
be on our way now.

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:37.695
Good day!

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:38.821
Let's get a move on, Rika!

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:41.115
[RIKA] I'm gonna
practice my hardest today!

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:43.826
Guess that's it, guys;
we're done for the day.

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.911
I really do need
to get going, too.

00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:47.830
Bye!

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:49.540
A lot of the shops
in the Hinamizawa area

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:51.292
belong to Mion's family.

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:52.877
She must be busy!

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:04.430
[KEIICHI] So Mion's a real
girly girl deep down, huh?

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:09.518
Whoa. Oh crap!

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:13.689
The hell are you doin'
to my bike, ya little turd?

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:17.818
[PUNK B]
Quit makin' that dumbass face!

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.112
We asked you a question!

00:21:20.154 --> 00:21:21.113
I'm really sorry.

00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:22.239
I didn't mean it.

00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:24.617
Then what the hell
did you do it for, huh?

00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:26.452
[PUNK C]
Lookit this shit!

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:28.621
Ya done scratched
the paint all to hell!

00:21:28.662 --> 00:21:30.581
Someone around here pay
ya to mess with our shit,

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:31.707
ya little bastard?

00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:32.958
That it?

00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:35.544
[????] You mind pissin'
off for me, asshole?

00:21:35.586 --> 00:21:37.838
Having trash out front
is bad for business.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.090
What'd you say to me, bitch?

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:41.842
Need me to dumb it down?

00:21:41.884 --> 00:21:44.261
Let Kei go, and
get the hell outta here.

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.597
You think you can talk
to us like that, huh?

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:47.973
Listen, skank!

00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:49.767
I don't mind hitting a girl!

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:51.060
[PUNK A] You're gonna
mouth off that much,

00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:51.644
you can pony up instead!

00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:54.313
Get out of here Mion,
these guys are no joke!

00:21:54.355 --> 00:21:57.316
Hop back on your shitty bikes
and roll your candy asses home!

00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:59.860
You shut your damn mouth!

00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:06.033
Hey, guys.

00:22:15.668 --> 00:22:17.586
What the hell is their problem?

00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:56.852
