WEBVTT

00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:23.815
[breathes heavily]

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:34.868
Ahh, you're
finally awake, I see.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.412
You nearly slept straight
through the sunset.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.790
What's going on?

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.166
Satoko.

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:43.669
You looked so
restless as you slept.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.005
I can hardly imagine the
nightmares you were having.

00:00:49.508 --> 00:00:51.510
[SATOKO]
And your fever is awful.

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:53.428
Please, let me take care of you.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.264
I'll stay here by your side.

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.891
I won't leave
till you're well again.

00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.102
Satoko.

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:04.856
[sobs]

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.483
Poor, suffering girl.

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:09.695
Please, someone,
help me understand it.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.154
Why is this happening?

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:13.865
What did I do?

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:19.746
[SATOKO] I can't know
what you saw in your dreams.

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:24.585
But whatever it was,
you know it meant something.

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:25.752
Huh?

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:28.714
[SATOKO] There's a reason you
have the dreams you do, Rika.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:31.216
A reason that's
very close to your heart.

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:35.804
[gasps]
Reason? There is no reason.

00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:38.557
There's nothing that
could justify this pain.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:43.604
Tell me, why do
I have to suffer?

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:44.688
[SATOKO]
Think.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.273
Do you genuinely not understand

00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:48.400
why these awful
dreams haunt you?

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:52.279
[gasps]
Satoko. What are you saying?

00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:55.324
[grunts]

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:57.576
It hurts everywhere.

00:01:57.618 --> 00:01:58.702
They don't stop.

00:01:58.744 --> 00:02:01.580
They won't allow you
a single night's rest.

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:05.167
Can you really not see
why they're so relentless?

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.339
[RIKA]
What's happening?

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.008
Rika, this is
the work of the curse.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.052
What does that mean?

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:17.429
What curse? I don't‐‐

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:23.310
What is this?
I can't feel my legs.

00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:26.146
Can't move. Please, Satoko.

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:27.564
[SATOKO]
Ohh...

00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:30.233
Let me show you.

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:31.276
[gasps]

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.621
[screams]

00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:44.414
That's right, Rika.

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:48.877
Watanagashi is here.

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.645
Uh, Watanagashi?

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:33.106
[SATOKO] You know the
purpose of this ritual.

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.817
This is how we quell
Lord Oyashiro's rage.

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:37.903
That way, he might
lift the curse.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.029
You keep saying...

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.280
[grunts]

00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:43.533
...that this is
the curse, but why?

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.619
[SATOKO]
Oh, dear.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.748
It appears the anesthetic
has fully worn off.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.044
We can fix that.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.379
Thankfully, we still
have one more dose.

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:59.341
I would never want
to make you suffer, Rika.

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.306
Don't do this!

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:09.267
[SATOKO] It's okay.
I'm quite experienced.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.354
Coach has me do my own
injections every day.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.231
You can trust me.

00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:22.405
The pain's going
away now, isn't it?

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.533
Please, tell me.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.368
You're saying these nightmares

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.246
are a result of
Lord Oyashiro's curse?

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.748
What does that mean?

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:32.666
You see.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:35.585
Lord Oyashiro revealed
something to me.

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:39.047
Revealed what?

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.924
[SATOKO] He revealed to me
that you're no longer fit

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:44.052
to fulfill your duty
as his priestess.

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:45.595
And therefore...

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.779
[gasps]

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:10.036
[SATOKO] ...he ordained me
to serve him in your place.

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:11.997
I am his priestess now.

00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:16.960
[RIKA]
Satoko!

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:21.006
You didn't receive
Lord Oyashiro's revelation!

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:23.008
It wasn't real. You're sick!

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.634
You just imagined it!

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:26.428
[SATOKO]
Rika.

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.682
[SATOKO]
I would like you to watch me

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:33.602
perform the offertory dance.

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.605
You must confront the truth.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.398
It's not through
chance or divine whim

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.233
that you're plagued
by these nightmares.

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:42.777
Please. Satoko. Stop this!

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:44.738
[SATOKO]
You gravely sinned.

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.240
And you will suffer forevermore.

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:48.909
[cries out]

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:54.539
Please stop this.

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:57.000
Tell me, what's my sin?

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:58.501
I don't understand!

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:00.629
Why do I have
to suffer like this?

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.089
I didn't do anything
to deserve it!

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:05.884
No, Rika. You did.

00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:09.054
Even as he had ordained you
to be his servant on earth,

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.306
you violated his precepts.

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:12.807
When was that?

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.434
I can't...

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:18.980
[SATOKO] Over and over,
for years upon years,

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:21.608
every waking moment, Rika.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.069
You've performed
your duties without faith.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.237
Lord Oyashiro can
see deep into your heart,

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.574
and he knows that in your soul
you've abandoned Hinamizawa!

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:33.536
What?

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.789
Even during his offertory dance,

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.459
his chosen servant longed
to escape his embrace!

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:40.877
[RIKA]
Yes.

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:44.297
When I was first caught in 1983.

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:49.010
When I was repeating it
hundreds upon hundreds of times.

00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:52.514
I was stuck living
the life of a captured bird.

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:55.392
And Hinamizawa Village
was my cage.

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:58.061
Of course I longed to be free.

00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:02.023
It was all I wanted. And then...

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:05.151
Jiro, please. Please help me!

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:09.864
[sobs]

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.616
[TOMITAKE]
Sorry I'm late.

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.702
It's all over now.

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:16.204
[RIKA]
After my century of tragedy,

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:19.249
we were finally able
to break the cycle.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.543
For a long time now,
there's a certain something

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:24.212
I've secretly been
dreaming of doing.

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:27.424
That was when I decided
I would leave Hinamizawa.

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:32.512
[laughs]

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:35.682
I've seen the way the syndrome
can twist people's minds.

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:39.269
I've heard it wring madness
from their mouths over and over.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.814
But never the plain truth,
until now.

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.986
[SATOKO] If I want
to cleanse you of your sin,

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:52.615
I have to carry out
this sacrament.

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:53.992
I'm sorry.

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:57.954
I never wanted it
to come down to this.

00:08:57.996 --> 00:08:59.289
But it had to!

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.249
I have no choice.

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:02.500
I'll take your place

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:05.712
in performing the
Watanagashi ritual!

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:21.519
Tell me. Why, Rika?

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:25.607
Why would you betray Lord
Oyashiro in your thoughts?

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:27.984
If you'd kept the faith.

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:31.029
If your heart had
stayed in Hinamizawa...

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:35.366
[SATOKO] ...you would
never have angered him.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:38.787
The curse would
never have befallen you!

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:43.374
If my heart had stayed...

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.548
You made this happen.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.674
All of it.

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:54.302
These are the
wages of your sins.

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:57.430
Your life and
all our friends' lives,

00:09:57.472 --> 00:10:02.185
and now‐‐they're paid!

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:04.354
I see.

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:07.690
I had chosen to make
this life my last one.

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:12.821
But by the time I arrived,
this world was already doomed.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.405
[SATOKO]
This is your fault!

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:17.659
Are you not the rebirth
of Lord Oyashiro himself?

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.203
So tell me why!

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:25.458
[SATOKO sobs]

00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:32.006
[grunting]

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:35.426
Tell me why. Tell me why!

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:39.347
Why would you violate
his precepts like that?!

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:41.224
It's your fault!

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:43.685
I would never have had
to do all these awful things

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:46.354
if you hadn't angered
Lord Oyashiro!

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:49.149
Were you not thinking
about Keiichi?

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.443
Or Rena, or Mion, or Shion?

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:55.989
Were all of them not enough
to make you stay here?

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.365
Rika!

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:06.291
[SATOKO]
I thought you loved Hinamizawa.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:09.252
That you cared for it
as much as me.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:12.547
What made you want to
leave it behind so badly?

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.204
What about everybody
else you grew up with?

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:46.080
[SATOKO] The kids at
school are your friends,

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:48.291
and the people in
the village are so kind.

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:49.292
All of them.

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:52.086
They've always
cared for you, right?

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:54.255
So, please. Please.

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:57.425
Tell me why you would
abandon us like that!

00:11:57.467 --> 00:12:00.178
It's not just hurting
Lord Oyashiro.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.222
It's hurting me!

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:06.184
The days we've shared in
Hinamizawa are precious to me.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.853
To think you could
just toss them aside.

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:12.106
It hurts, Rika, so much!

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:23.993
[RIKA]
What was it?

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:28.081
What made me start
to hate Hinamizawa?

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:30.416
[RIKA]
The answer to that is simple.

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:39.592
Hinamizawa was my prison.

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:41.928
Of course. That's why.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.973
And so, as soon as
I'd broken the cycle.

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:46.474
I had to leave.

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:49.269
I wanted a glamorous
life at a fancy school.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.230
My quaint hometown
had gotten stale.

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:54.524
Was it wrong of me
to feel that way?

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:55.817
A century.

00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:59.153
A hundred years I lived there.

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:11.374
Looking now,

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:14.919
was there anything about
Hinamizawa that I didn't like?

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:18.006
There was never a
single bad thing about it.

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:20.300
All the tragedies
I suffered through.

00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:22.593
All the mysterious murders.

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.637
They arose from people's
plans gone astray,

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:26.639
or their emotions clashing.

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:27.849
On some days,

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.852
I would laugh too hard
to feel time going by,

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:34.063
and on others, I would lie on
the floor sobbing in despair,

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:35.940
and time would
seem to sit still.

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:37.358
But every day,

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.112
I could feel the
warm embrace of Hinamizawa.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:44.490
And after a century,
the painful days stopped,

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:46.784
and there were only good days.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:48.745
I could feel
the village smiling,

00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:51.497
knowing I could stay
here without suffering,

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:54.417
but I...

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:58.338
I... I still... I resented it.

00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:01.341
My "quaint hometown"!

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:05.678
I've been so foolish.

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:08.222
[SATOKO]
This is a curse.

00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:12.060
[SATOKO]
This is your curse.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:20.068
Forgive me.

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:23.404
I know that I was wrong.

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:27.784
Huh? Rika?

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.328
I'm so sorry.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.414
Satoko, I never
meant to hurt you,

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:36.292
but I drove you to this.

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:37.835
[SATOKO]
All I want is to live here

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:40.463
in Hinamizawa
together with you, Rika.

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:43.049
I would never
need anything else.

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:48.596
Please, forgive me.

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:51.516
I forgive you,
and since you repented,

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:55.478
I know that Lord Oyashiro
can forgive you too.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.860
Good.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:06.948
I'll get things right next time.

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:25.216
Ah. We're finally awake, are we?

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:26.300
Satoko?

00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:28.136
Not a moment too soon either.

00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:29.637
What a waste it
would be to sleep through

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:32.140
such a nice day like this.

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:34.809
[RIKA]
Hold on. Where are we?

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:37.019
So, not quite awake, I see.

00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:39.313
We're here in
Hinamizawa, obviously!

00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:41.023
Mion had a brilliant idea.

00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:43.109
[KEIICHI]
Oh, hey, Rika!

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:44.527
You awake now?

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:47.447
Rika, Satoko! Come jump in!

00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:49.782
Now we can finally
start the real game!

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:52.577
That real game
being a club activity.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:55.288
I hope you runts are
ready for some bloodshed.

00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:56.247
There wouldn't have been any

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:59.041
if you hadn't tried to catch
that ball with your face, dear.

00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:01.335
[MION]
Hey! Don't tell them that!

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:02.336
[laughter]

00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:03.296
[KEIICHI]
She's right though.

00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:06.215
[MION] Can you please
lay off for one day, Shion?

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:07.425
[KEIICHI]
What's the hold‐up?

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:08.718
You scared or something?

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:10.511
That's quite the
tone you're taking.

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:12.555
I don't believe you
fully understand exactly

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:14.932
what I'm capable
of yet, dear Keiichi.

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:18.060
[SATOKO chortles]

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:20.062
I'm sure you'll figure it
out in due time,

00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:21.647
perhaps just as one of my traps

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:23.774
pulls you into
the watery depths.

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:24.901
[RIKA]
Satoko?

00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:27.195
Is something wrong?

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:29.447
Not really,
but can I talk to you?

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:34.577
My bad, Satoko!

00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:37.079
[SATOKO]
The nerve of that boy!

00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:39.957
I hate to be rude, Rika,
but it'll have to wait.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:43.503
Right now there's an enemy
before me who must be destroyed!

00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:44.420
[RIKA]
Mm.

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:46.464
Okay, I'm with you!

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.508
Our poor, foolish friend
Keiichi's decided

00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:50.968
to start a war
that he can't win.

00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:55.306
Mii! Sorry for the wait!

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:57.308
Awooo! Rika!

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.268
You're too adorable
in that swimsuit!

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.853
I wanna take you home!

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:04.106
Come on.
Satoko is at least as cute!

00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:06.234
Please get your hands off of me!

00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:08.528
But the compliment
was very nice,

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:09.820
so do keep that up.

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:12.448
Awoo! They're both so cute!

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.158
I just wanna take
both of 'em home

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.284
with me right now!

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:17.203
Enough. Get it together, kids!

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:18.955
This is an
official club activity,

00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:21.040
so there's a
penalty on the line!

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:24.085
[laughter]

00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:25.044
[SHION]
Oh goodness.

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:42.061
[SATOKO] Wasn't that
such a fun day, Rika?

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:44.897
Yes, almost too much
fun for me to handle.

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:46.941
Uh. You said you
needed to talk to me

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:48.150
about something before.

00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:49.902
What was it?

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:51.862
[RIKA]
You honestly may not be able

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:54.407
to make sense
of what I'm saying.

00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:58.202
If you can't, I would at least
like you to hear it all.

00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:03.124
You see.

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:05.001
There were these
two dreams I had before,

00:18:05.042 --> 00:18:07.211
that both seemed years long.

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:11.382
The first one felt like pure
torture as I was dreaming it.

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:13.759
But when I remember
that dream now.

00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:17.305
All the wonderous
moments come back to me.

00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:18.806
And in the second.

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:20.933
I let all those
wonders pass me by.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:24.520
I chased my selfish desires
and I suffered for it.

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:34.030
[SATOKO]
It never seemed to end.

00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:35.573
But I got through it,

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:36.907
and it made me realize something

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.452
I should have already known.

00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:40.953
Satoko.

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:43.706
I love this village
more than anything!

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:52.673
Hinamizawa is a beautiful place,

00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:55.760
and I get to share it
with all my wonderful friends.

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.553
But I was a fool.

00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:01.766
For some reason,
I thought I wanted to leave.

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:03.851
Rika.

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:10.858
I can hardly guess
what kind of things

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.735
you've seen in your dreams,

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:14.320
but whatever may happen,

00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:17.198
I am always going
to be your friend.

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:18.157
Always.

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:19.950
The whole village loves you.

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:24.121
We all do, and we always will.

00:19:28.042 --> 00:19:29.335
[SATOKO]
It's over.

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:34.507
You're not gonna have
any more nightmares, okay?

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:36.550
[RIKA]
Satoko!

00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:42.556
[RIKA]
This world is at peace.

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:45.434
Lord Oyashiro's curse
isn't even thought of.

00:19:45.476 --> 00:19:47.228
Like it's vanished.

00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:48.896
Without a trace.

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:56.696
Ahhh!

00:19:56.737 --> 00:19:58.864
Thank you so much Keiichi!

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.825
Hey, it was
the least I could do!

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:03.119
[RENA]
I got my very own Kenta‐<i>kun</i>.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.078
He's the cutest ever!

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:08.207
[RIKA] Keiichi and Rena‐‐never
become consumed by paranoia.

00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:22.513
[SATOKO]
What's wrong?

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:25.516
Oh, I just got distracted
thinking about dinner.

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.101
Ni‐paa!

00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:30.104
[SATOKO] It's shocking how
much you think about food.

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:32.273
Let's hurry home
and get started then.

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:36.569
[RIKA] Satoko's vicious uncle
never returns to the house.

00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:12.396
[RIKA]
Keiichi and Shion stay

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:16.233
and watch the ceremonial
dance to the end.

00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:21.947
[RIKA] There's no need for me to
cast the dice in this world.

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:23.407
It's perfect.

00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:27.620
[RIKA] And the cruel fate
that's been demanding my death

00:21:27.661 --> 00:21:29.663
for so many years.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:36.295
[RIKA]
At long last, I might be free.

00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:55.606
[RIKA]
Tomitake!

00:21:56.857 --> 00:21:58.108
That you, Rika?

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.654
[RIKA] Yes. I have something
I need to tell you about me...

00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:03.280
...and Takano.

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:04.323
Huh?

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.701
Takano?

00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:09.578
[TAKANO]
Excellent timing!

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.454
Actually,

00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:13.582
I had been hoping we
could have a talk as well.

00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:17.628
[TAKANO]
Would now be okay?

00:23:50.012 --> 00:23:53.057
[RIKA] Next time:
<i>Nekodamashi‐hen</i>, Part Four.
