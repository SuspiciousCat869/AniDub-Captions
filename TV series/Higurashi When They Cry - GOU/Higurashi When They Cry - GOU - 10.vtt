[KEIICHI] Oh, yeah?
You think you're in pain?

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:42.334
What about Satoko?

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:44.878
You don't even know
what real pain is!

late today, Keiichi!

You overslept again, didn't you?

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.281
Didn't you?

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:37.908
Yeah, sorry, Rena.

A weird dream? About what?

[KEIICHI]
I can't remember the details,

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:48.335
but I think it had something
to do with Satoko.

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:50.128
Oh, crap, we gotta go!

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.756
Oh! Yeah, you're right,
we're gonna be late!

00:02:52.798 --> 00:02:53.757

You two are really
somethin' else.

[KEIICHI]
Wait.

00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:10.148
Did we actually get here
before Satoko and Rika.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.233
That's so strange.

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:13.276
Those two never
show up to class late.

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.445
You think maybe Satoko ate
too much at the barbecue

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:18.490
and needed to take
a day to sleep it off?

you again, everyone.

would show up late for school?

Hello, young man. How do you do?

Easy, son, I'm not
just skulking around.

I'm a detective
with the Okinomiya PD.

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:50.165
Oh, no.

00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:52.334
See, I actually came here
to have a brief discussion

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.085
with a classmate of yours.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.674
And what do you need
to talk to her for?

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:01.802
Nothing you need to worry about.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:04.429
Just a few questions
I need answered.

Could you spare a moment
to help me find her?

why not just call her house?

Don't go prowling around
looking for her at school.

Well you sure told me.

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.109
So should I call you up

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.029
and schedule an
appointment next time?

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.323
Excuse me, girls!

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.077
[OIISHI] Would you two mind
finding Satoko Hojo

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.495
and bringing her here?

00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:29.412
[GIRL A]
Oh.

Sorry sir, she isn't here today.

Well then, could one
of you give me the name

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:40.298
of this young fellow right here?

[GIRL A]
Keiichi Maebara, sir.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:43.593
Really?!

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.929
At last I get to meet
this Maebara boy

00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:48.932
I've heard so much about.

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:50.809
There's something important

00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:53.353
I should share with you,
Mister Maebara.

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:57.023
Avoid making
enemies around here.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.316
These folks stick together,

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.360
and you don't wanna be
on the wrong side of 'em.

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:02.529
[IRIE] I think you've
made your point, Detective.

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.530
[OOISHI]
What's this?

00:06:03.572 --> 00:06:06.199
Doctor Irie's chosen to join us!

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.076
You know, I'd been
thinking I might stop by

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:09.995
your clinic later
and have a word.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:13.039
I would advise you to pick up
a warrant on your way.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.749
Otherwise I'm afraid
you'd simply be

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.585
wasting both of our time.

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:19.504
[OOISHI laughs]

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.965
Well, I'll be in touch.

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:23.633
Bastard.

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.473
That hurt like hell.

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:33.184
How is there not even a mark?

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:36.688
One can infer he's practiced
that move quite a bit.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.481
Comes with the job, perhaps.

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:41.234
What's his deal, anyway?

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:44.779
He told me he was
looking for Satoko.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:48.825
So the man's ready to go back
to badgering Satoko, is he?

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:52.203
You would never guess by looking
at him what a snake he is.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:54.497
You're a recent arrival
to Hinamizawa,

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.583
so I suppose this
is all news to you.

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:59.419
This may seem
like a strange question,

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:02.505
but have you heard about
the curse of Lord Oyashiro?

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:03.465
[KEIICHI]
That's what everyone blamed

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.926
when Satoko's
parents died, right?

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:08.470
'Cause they had been in
favor of building the dam.

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.055
[IRIE]
Good, we can skip ahead.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.015
Satoko and Satoshi
had nowhere else to go

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:13.725
when their parents died.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.143
They ended up
staying here in the village

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.228
with their aunt and uncle.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.272
[KEIICHI]
Nobody told me about that.

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:21.524
Yes, their father's younger
brother and his wife

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:24.402
were the only family around
who could take them in.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:25.403
And unfortunately,

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.738
those two were
not the sort of people

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.782
who could be trusted
to babysit children,

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:30.533
let alone raise them.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:31.368
The moment they assumed

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.703
legal guardianship of
Satoko and Satoshi,

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.580
they immediately set
about looting everything

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:38.166
their parents had left to them.

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.501
They were abusive,

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:42.170
yelling at the kids for
everything and nothing,

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:44.130
forcing them to skip meals.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:46.466
And they would beat
them relentlessly.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:49.636
[IRIE] Back then,
Satoko wasn't the peppy,

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:51.680
energetic little girl you know.

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.932
She was having to go
through far too much.

00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:57.060
I know her living situation's
not like that anymore.

00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:58.520
What changed, exactly?

00:07:58.561 --> 00:07:59.646
Indeed.

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:03.817
Just last year her aunt died
on the night of Watanagashi.

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:07.153
Beaten to death with a
baseball bat, to be specific,

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.990
by some miscreant
in a narcotic‐fueled rage.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.032
[gasps]

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:11.992
Her uncle was convinced

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.327
that she'd been
a victim of the curse.

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:16.997
He abandoned the kids
and fled Hinamizawa.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:20.083
[KEIICHI] And that's how Satoko
got away from him, right?

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:21.209
Exactly.

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:22.252
But then, another snake

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:24.379
slithered his way
onto the scene.

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:25.964
Kuraudo Ooishi.

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.382
[gasps]

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:29.217
That guy.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:31.344
As you've seen,
he's a strange man.

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:34.347
Every incident attributed to
the curse has been investigated,

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.641
and they were all eventually
determined to be unfortunate

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:40.395
accidents or completely
mundane criminal acts.

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:41.938
But it seems the
fact that every case

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.858
was resolved isn't
enough to satisfy him.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:48.820
In Hinamizawa, they came up
with a name for Ooishi.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:52.198
They call him
"Lord Oyashiro's servant."

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.618
Lord Oyashiro's servant?

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.003
Hey, Rika.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:08.381
You think Satoko is gonna
make it in time to eat with us?

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:11.676
If Rika's not
comfortable telling us,

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:13.094
we'll just have to wait.

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:16.598
For all we know, we might
be worrying over nothing.

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:21.352
Mion, why does it seem like you
know something about all this?

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:22.645
How's that?

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:26.858
[KEIICHI] You've been
acting sketchy all morning.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.111
I heard something
from a council member.

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:31.988
Something that got me worried.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.239
What was it?

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.909
We haven't told you
about Satoko's uncle.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:36.910
You mean, that freaking bastard

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:38.745
who beat her up and starved her?

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:40.538
Oh, wow.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.707
Guess you heard it
somewhere else.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:45.210
His name is Teppei Hojo,
and apparently,

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:48.630
he turned up again
in Hinamizawa recently.

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:50.799
[SATOKO]
Huh?

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:53.760
[gasps]

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:55.720
Satoko!

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:58.181
[SATOKO sighs]
What is it, Keiichi?

00:09:58.223 --> 00:09:59.724
Everybody's been worried sick!

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.976
Why did you get here
halfway through lunchtime?

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.812
[chuckles softly]

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:06.356
What a silly thing
to worry about.

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:09.317
Hey, Satoko?

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:10.985
Are you okay?

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:13.696
I'm sorry if
I caused you any concern.

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:15.865
My uncle just needed me
to run a few errands for him

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.158
before I came in.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.284
On a school day?

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:19.994
He should do it for himself!

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:23.414
I'd really rather eat lunch than
talk about this, if we could.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.750
I'm feeling quite peckish
at the moment.

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:29.754
Satoko.

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.008
Okay!

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.094
All five members present
and accounted for,

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:38.096
now it's time
to let the games begin!

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:40.098
Heck yeah, I'm ready to play!

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.100
Let's do it, Satoko!

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:44.894
[MION]
And just for today,

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:46.813
we're all gonna play
whatever you pick.

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:48.773
You call it, kiddo!

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:51.651
So c'mon, what's it gonna be?

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:53.820
That's a kind offer, thank you.

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.239
But I'm afraid
I have to decline.

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.824
Hey, wait, Satoko!

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:00.326
There's a penalty
if you leave early!

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:04.747
I don't remember which club rule
that is, but it is in there.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:06.374
Let it slide, okay?

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:08.418
Now's not the time to push her.

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:10.628
I wasn't trying to.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.506
[SATOKO]
Please, guys. I appreciate it.

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:15.049
Genuinely.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.176
It's just...

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:19.345
I have things to take care
of that really can't wait.

00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:23.766
[MION]
Satoko.

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:26.227
[KEIICHI]
Hey. We're friends, right?

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:27.854
On the same team?

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:33.443
Rika, can you please
tell us what's going on?

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.196
Mii.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:38.198
[KEIICHI]
What happened?

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.366
[MION]
Please, Rika.

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:42.368
[RENA]
We all want to help.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.290
Yesterday.

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:49.709
Satoko went out
to buy groceries,

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:53.046
and when the sun went down,
she still hadn't come home.

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.737
Satoko!

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:20.698
You had me worried.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.951
Let's hurry up and start dinner!

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:24.827
Rika, wait.

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:27.580
I only came here to get
all my things packed up.

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:28.873
Huh?

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:30.333
My uncle has returned,

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:33.795
and I'm going to be
moving back in with him.

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:39.425
After that, she gathered up
her belongings like she said.

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:42.136
Everything is all moved out now.

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.513
So after all that's happened,

00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:46.891
she's back in the same
crappy situation as before.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:48.643
It'll be so much worse.

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:49.560
[KEIICHI]
Huh?

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:53.940
This time she
won't have Satoshi.

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:57.568
Satoshi was the only thing
that kept Satoko safe.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.195
When things were at their worst,

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:01.906
her brother was always
there to protect her.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:04.742
But now, with him gone,

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:08.246
Satoko will be cooped up in that
house all alone with her uncle.

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:09.330
[KEIICHI]
Dammit!

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:11.040
If we know that
he's abusing her,

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:13.293
isn't there somebody
who we can tell?

00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:14.377
Yeah, that's right!

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:15.837
If we bring proof to the police.

00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:18.089
We reported it before.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.675
Last year,
I went to Child Welfare.

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:23.177
So what did they do about it?

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:25.847
[MION] They sent out a social
worker to check on things.

00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:29.267
Then they interviewed
Satoko and Satoshi,

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:31.102
and then their aunt and uncle.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:33.313
Why would they
interview the adults?

00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:35.106
Well it would hardly be
fair to make a decision

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:38.901
without getting both sides of
the story first, now would it?

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:40.945
And what did
they say in the end?

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.155
"We'll stand by."

00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:43.948
Stand by for what?

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.452
Their beatings hadn't left any
visible marks or bruises.

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:50.330
Not like they could
get 'em on video, either.

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:53.624
And no witnesses,
since it all happened at home.

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.668
Then what happened?

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.128
[MION]
You can guess.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.089
The abuse only got
worse for both of them.

00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:02.467
The authorities
couldn't fix things.

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:12.143
There has to be something
we can do to help Satoko, right?

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:13.728
Mii...

00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:20.276
It's good to see
all of you this morning.

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:23.821
Ms. Furude.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:26.866
And has Ms. Hojo
come along with you today?

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.955
Please study while I step out.

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:35.875
[CHIE]
A moment, Ms. Furude?

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.297
[CHIE]
Ms. Hojo's uncle.

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:43.341
Is the rumor true?

00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:47.428
[CHIE]
Then I know what's happening.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:48.429
What now?

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:49.389
Huh?

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.640
If you know about
what's happening,

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:53.393
then what are you
going to do about it?

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.522
I can go visit her at her house,

00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:59.857
and if I notice
anything wrong...

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.485
Then you'll report it
to Child Welfare, right?

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:05.905
They won't do anything
unless there's proof of abuse.

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:07.365
[CHIE]
You three!

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:09.367
You should all be in study hall!

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:11.160
[KEIICHI]
To hell with study hall, ma'am!

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:13.830
Satoko's in trouble,
and she needs our help!

00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:15.540
I understand your frustration,

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.333
but until I've seen
her living situation,

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:19.836
I can't make
a report in good faith!

00:15:19.877 --> 00:15:21.254
She's right.

00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:22.046
I think it's best

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:25.174
if we let Ms. Chie
handle things for right now.

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:26.801
[RIKA]
I agree.

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:29.220
I think it's best
if we listen to Rena.

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:32.598
All right, if that's
fine with you, Rika.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.599
[CHIE]
Class Rep.

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:35.685
Please escort them back.

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:37.895
Let's go.

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:52.243
[knocking]

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:53.244
[CHIE]
Hello.

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:54.620
Mister Hojo?

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:56.205
Are you home?

00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:59.792
[TEPPEI]
Who the hell are you?

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:01.836
[CHIE]
You must be Satoko's uncle.

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:05.673
My name is Chie and I'm here on
behalf of the Hinamizawa school.

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:06.924
You her teacher?

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.510
Could I please speak
with Satoko for a bit?

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:10.720
Huh?

00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:13.473
You ain't at school, what
the hell's there to talk about?

00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:15.349
Satoko never
came to class today,

00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:18.478
and nobody from her household
called to report her absence.

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:21.564
[TEPPEI] Oh yeah, she seems to
have come down with somethin'.

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:24.442
Full blown fever,
feelin' like shit all day.

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:25.943
[CHIE]
I see.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.904
Will she be able
to come in tomorrow?

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:29.238
Like I would know!

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.492
You think I can see the
future or somethin' bitch?

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:45.463
[RENA]
How did it go, Ms. Chie?

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.673
[MION]
You went to visit, right?

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:49.050
So what happened?

00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:51.302
You were waiting here
for me all this time?

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:52.261
Did she look hurt?

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:53.763
Was she doing okay?

00:16:53.804 --> 00:16:55.223
I don't know.

00:16:55.264 --> 00:16:57.391
I didn't get a chance
to talk to her.

00:16:57.433 --> 00:16:59.727
[KEIICHI]
Then what was the point?

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.772
[sighs]
I already know what stopped you.

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:06.359
If he wouldn't let you see her,

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.860
you know that means
whatever he's doing

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:10.488
must have left a mark on her!

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.532
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:15.034
That's enough, Keiichi.

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:18.037
There's nothing else
Ms. Chie can do right now.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.622
Damn it!

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:21.749
But at least we know
what's happening.

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:23.543
Satoko's bastard uncle
is keeping her

00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:25.127
locked up in her house!

00:17:25.169 --> 00:17:26.212
[RENA]
Yeah.

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:27.630
I think it should be enough.

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:30.132
I'll make the call to
Child Welfare Services.

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.592
If I tell them what we know,

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:33.803
I'm sure they'll be able
to help somehow.

00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:35.805
They didn't help back
when I called,

00:17:35.846 --> 00:17:39.350
but if a teacher was calling it,
it might get their attention.

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:47.900
[KEIICHI]
"Standing by"? What the hell?

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:50.152
Why won't they do anything?

00:17:50.194 --> 00:17:51.571
They did.

00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:53.322
Satoko's house
received a phone call

00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:56.867
from Child Welfare Services,
and that was it.

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:58.452
So he feeds 'em some bullcrap,

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:00.496
and they decide
to stay on standby?

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:04.041
[SATOKO] Surely there's
no need to be so loud, is there?

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:05.126
[KEIICHI]
Satoko?

00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:07.336
Yes. Now, would you
please quiet down?

00:18:07.378 --> 00:18:10.047
Satoko! Is everything okay?

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:12.717
[MION] Child Welfare
Services called, right?

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.719
What'd they say?

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.054
Was that on one
of your accounts?

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:20.141
You gave us quite
a bit of hassle, if so.

00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:23.436
None of us wanted to cause
any trouble for you, Satoko.

00:18:23.477 --> 00:18:25.730
We were just worried about you.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:28.107
So please,
tell us what happened!

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:30.192
I was home sick yesterday.

00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:33.779
This morning I woke up healthy,
so I came to school as usual.

00:18:33.821 --> 00:18:36.449
[chortles]

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.367
[KEIICHI]
Satoko, what are you saying?

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:46.584
Rika, what the hell's going on?

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:48.336
[RIKA]
When the social worker called,

00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:50.379
Satoko just said,
"Everything is fine,"

00:18:50.421 --> 00:18:53.633
and hung up
without another word.

00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:54.717
Those morons!

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:55.968
They don't think
her uncle coached her

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.470
on what to say to them?

00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:58.763
And they know this guy!

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:01.098
They came out before!

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.102
Actually, this one is
the third incident.

00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:06.646
[KEIICHI]
For him?

00:19:06.687 --> 00:19:08.147
For Satoko.

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:10.733
Third reported abuse incident.

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:14.695
I knew Mion called in to Child
Welfare Services last year.

00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:17.573
Was that the second time?

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:20.117
Things in Satoko's
family were complicated.

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:23.120
She didn't live
with her actual father.

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:24.872
Her parents were separated.

00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:26.832
They were with
her mom and stepdad.

00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:27.833
It was much better than

00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:30.002
when they were
with her aunt and uncle,

00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:33.631
But even back then, they were
far from a happy family.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:36.759
At one point,

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:39.428
she wanted her stepfather
out of the picture,

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.472
so she made a call to
Child Welfare Services

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:43.766
falsely claiming
he'd abused her.

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:45.142
[KEIICHI]
So that's it?

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.436
She made a
false report one time,

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.107
and now they're
on permanent standby?

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.735
[KEIICHI]
That's so stupid!

00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:02.868
[school bell ringing]

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:03.911
[SATOKO]
Everyone!

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:05.913
I believe it's time for lunch!

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:07.665
Mii.

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:10.918
Lunch is always better
when all five of us are here!

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.628
Exactly right!

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:13.254
Yup.

00:20:13.295 --> 00:20:15.339
And for you!

00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:16.716
I do feel a bit guilty,

00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:19.051
having to ask you to make
my lunch every day.

00:20:19.093 --> 00:20:20.386
Don't worry, it's fine!

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:22.054
I consider it
a privilege to be able

00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:25.558
to make a lovely lunch
for my dearest friend.

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:26.726
Rika.

00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:29.478
[RIKA] And now I don't have
to eat the burnt Hamburg steak.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.897
You poor, poor thing, Satoko!

00:20:31.939 --> 00:20:33.190
Ni‐pah!

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:36.068
[laughs]
Yeah, that's Rika!

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.404
So, what's in your
lunchbox today, Mion?

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:39.155
[MION]
Once again,

00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:41.991
I've gone with the leftover
party snack special.

00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:44.702
[RENA] Same here,
last night's leftovers.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.495
[RIKA] Ooh, daikon
left over from the night

00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:48.706
before is the best kind!

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:51.292
Man, this whole
spread looks amazing!

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:53.127
It would be wasted
on you, Satoko,

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:54.170
but I'll tell you
how great it was

00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:56.046
after I'm finished, sound good?

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:57.923
[SATOKO]
Excuse me?

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:02.887
I'll be sampling this
if you don't mind!

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:03.554
Dang it all!

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:06.432
[SATOKO chortles]

00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:10.853
You would have really
enjoyed this daikon, Keiichi.

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:12.438
It's exquisite!

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.273
Jeez, you brat.

00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:21.530
Hey, are you okay, Satoko?

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:24.241
Satoko, what's wrong?

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:34.335
[KEIICHI]
Whoa. Satoko, what is it?

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:37.171
[screams]

00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:38.547
Easy, Satoko!

00:21:42.343 --> 00:21:43.636
[SATOKO]
No!

00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:46.138
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.390
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

00:21:48.432 --> 00:21:52.978
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.814
I hate this. I hate this!

00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:57.107
Please make it stop!

00:21:57.149 --> 00:22:00.277
Forgive me! I can't take it!

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:03.280
[sobs]

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:06.408
I hate this!
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.995
[sobs]

00:22:10.037 --> 00:22:12.873
No!

00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:16.460
Nii‐nii! Please help me!

00:22:16.502 --> 00:22:20.923
What is this?
What's happening to her?

00:23:52.932 --> 00:23:56.352
[RIKA] Next time:
