[screams]

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.187
[KEIICHI]
Satoko, it's me. It's Keiichi!

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:21.563
Do you hear me?

00:00:21.605 --> 00:00:23.482
[SATOKO]
No!

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:27.027
[KEIICHI]
It's okay! We're friends.

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:28.654
I won't hurt you!

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.907
[SATOKO]
Help me. Someone, help!

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.158
Satoko!

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.078
[RENA] Please. Just give
her some space, Keiichi.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.454
[SATOKO sobs]
No!

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:38.664
[RENA]
Don't be scared, Satoko.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:42.459
You're safe here with us.
It's okay.

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:45.879
[SATOKO]
Nii‐nii. Help me. I need you!

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.969
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.596
We wanted to help you,
and we failed.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.849
[RENA]
Please forgive us.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.280
[gasps]

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:37.366
Kids, what happened?

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:39.993
Ms. Hojo? Are you okay?

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.250
[SATOKO chortles]
Oh, I'm fine,

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:49.544
if a bit embarrassed that
things got so out of hand!

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:55.342
My, and all over a silly dispute
with Rena about lunch. Really!

00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:56.885
[chortles]

00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:59.179
I'm sorry if
I took the joke too far!

00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:02.808
But I think it would be best
for everyone if we moved on now.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.686
We can't do that.
If we can't help...

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.149
[RIKA]
Satoko?

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.697
Yes, Rika?

00:03:19.658 --> 00:03:21.159
Will you please come back
to the shrine with me

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:24.287
and stay over tonight?

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.248
I explained this.

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.251
My uncle has moved back to town,
and I'm living with him now.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:32.295
[RIKA] I know, but that's
not what you want, is it?

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:34.798
[SATOKO]
It doesn't matter what I want.

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.432
Hey, Rika. How'd it go?

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.021
It's bullcrap!

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.857
Why has Child Welfare
Services been sitting

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.900
on their hands this whole time?

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.737
[MION] Satoko has a false
abuse report on her record.

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:59.322
They won't intervene
without hard evidence.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:01.658
So what? We wait around
for him to do something

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.326
that leaves her bloody
and bruised?

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:05.912
Stop, Keiichi!
I only meant they're‐‐

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:09.040
[SHION] What the hell
is left to talk about?

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.502
Wait, Shion? You're here?

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:15.130
[SHION] If we don't stop him,
he will kill her.

00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:17.257
Enough talking. We need to act!

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.551
[RENA] Yeah, I agree
with Shion and Keiichi.

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:23.305
It's true. Satoko needs
our help, we can't wait!

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.807
There must be something
we can do for her!

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.100
[KEIICHI]
But what would it be?

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:29.644
Will another report to
Child Welfare change anything?

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:32.022
[SHION] We don't have time
to cut through red tape!

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:35.484
Let's ambush the pig bastard
and cut his throat!

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:41.114
[RENA]
That isn't right!

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:44.242
Shion. More violence
won't fix this!

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.369
We have to find
a better way to help her!

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:48.663
So who's gonna protect her
while we're looking?

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.625
If Satoko's safe,
I don't care what I have to do!

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:54.294
What would I tell Satoshi
if something happened to her?

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:56.087
[MION]
You need to calm down, Shion.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.090
[SHION] And you, leader
of the great Sonozaki house.

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:02.677
Do something good with
that name and help her!

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.054
You can't, right?

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.806
The demon hag is
still the real leader,

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.599
and she still thinks
she's fighting the Hojos

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:09.810
in the dam war!

00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:14.272
[SHION] So stand around here
and wait for your friend to die.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.649
I'll go alone!

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.569
Satoko is not my blood,
but she is my sister!

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:21.988
I've got a pig to slaughter.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.782
See ya later.

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:25.033
[KEIICHI]
Wait.

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:27.285
What for? You won't stop me.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.413
If you murdered somebody
to save Satoko's life,

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.833
would you expect her
to be thankful for that?

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:35.252
I'll still do it even
if she hates me for it.

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:39.339
I want her to live a happy life,
even if I can't be part of it.

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.258
[KEIICHI]
That's not right.

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:44.302
You would end up regretting it
till the day you die.

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.096
You'd only realize
what you wanted out of this

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.139
when you saw that it was gone.

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.559
You don't wanna kill anyone.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.810
You wanna go back to a world

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:54.604
where all your friends
can live happily!

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:56.273
But this won't get us there.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:57.774
None of us would be
happy in a world

00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:59.317
where you're a murderer!

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.861
And Satoko would
spend her whole life

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:03.572
blaming herself for turning
her friend into a killer.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:06.408
You say you'd do it for her,
but it'd make her miserable!

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.617
If you really meant
what you said

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:09.327
about letting
her live a happy life,

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.246
you'd be making a big mistake!

00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:12.831
Have you come up
with any kind of plan

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:15.333
to keep Satoko's uncle
from killing her?

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.127
Because I have!

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:19.629
So get the hell out of my way!

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:23.592
I can't let you do this.

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:28.430
Understood. You're on <i>his</i> side.

00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:31.391
Fine, If I have to bust you open
to get to him then so be it!

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:33.852
[MION]
Shion! Put that down!

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:36.021
[KEIICHI]
Shion.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.648
You're right. I have no plan.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.275
But I'm sure that if
all of us work together,

00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:43.612
we can still figure out a
better way to protect Satoko.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:44.738
We have to!

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.239
[SHION]
Last warning.

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:48.241
Move, Keiichi, right now!

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:50.201
[KEIICHI] Believe in
your friends and in me!

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:53.038
I swear I'm gonna save
Satoko, no matter what!

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.456
Shut your mouth!

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:56.750
Your words aren't
worth a thing to me!

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:58.001
[MION]
Shion!

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:04.549
[KEIICHI]
Is that it?

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:08.428
'Cause if you wanna go,
you'll have to kill me.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.679
If you walk out this door,

00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:12.515
then you'll be walking out
of our world for good.

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.267
And Satoko will spend every day

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:16.686
believing it's
her fault you left us.

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:18.939
Her world will be hell!

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.651
Do you not understand that
I'm done talking about it?

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:25.070
I don't wanna live
in world like that.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.988
I want a world with my friends.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.948
All of you!

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:29.950
One where we can play together!

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:38.625
It would be impossible to live
in a world without of hope.

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:39.751
And we don't.

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:42.545
As long as we're all here,
there's a chance.

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:46.049
It may be hard to see it,
but hope is not gone.

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:49.636
Please. Believe in me!

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.359
Nice save. Thank you.

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:05.694
Ni‐pah!

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.821
[SHION]
So, what now?

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:09.572
It was a nice little spiel;
I'll give you that.

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:12.158
But we're no closer
to resolving things.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.410
[RIKA]
I know you, Keiichi.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.286
You'll understand this.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.288
We're in a really
tough place right now,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.165
and it's starting
to look like a dead end,

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:21.167
but I know there's
still a way out.

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:22.669
I'm sure if we
all work together,

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:24.587
we can make a miracle happen.

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:25.839
Doing that is enough.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.049
We'll win if we stick together.

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:29.009
[KEIICHI]
That's it!

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.803
We go to Child Welfare
Services in person!

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.555
[SHION]
What are you saying?

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:34.347
[KEIICHI]
We're the only ones

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.057
who know what
she's going through!

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:39.144
I think Keiichi's right.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.895
I'm not sure anybody
they've talked to yet

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:43.565
could explain her
situation like we could.

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:44.858
I get that.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:47.944
Attacking this issue
head‐on might be best.

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:50.655
Once those bureaucrats
make a decision,

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:53.283
I've heard they usually
won't give it a second look.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:55.035
You think the system
will help her?

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:58.663
[KEIICHI] Even if it won't,
we at least have to try, right?

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:02.208
[RENA]
Well, Shion?

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.711
Will you come help us
fight for our friend?

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:11.009
I'm with you. Let's get to work.

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:22.187
They don't mind making us wait.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:23.438
[OFFICIAL]
Mister Maebara?

00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:26.733
Apologies for the wait.

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:29.486
[KEIICHI] So I believe
your agency received a call

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:31.446
from our school yesterday.

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:34.449
You've been taking a
"wait and see" approach so far,

00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:36.117
but our friend
really needs help,

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.036
and it seems like you don't
have the entire picture

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:40.705
of what's going on
in her home right now.

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.999
[CWS WORKER]
All right. Specifically?

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:45.710
We realize Satoko didn't
say anything was wrong,

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:48.755
but that's only because
her uncle was threatening her.

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.715
So you're going to keep
"monitoring the situation"

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.217
until he murders her?

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.969
[CWS WORKER] Please understand,
Ms. Hojo's case is still active.

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.388
"Wait and see" is a
mischaracterization.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.350
When you say "active,"
what does that mean?

00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:02.519
I'm sorry, but whatever
it is you're doing here

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.437
hasn't helped her at all.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:07.857
One of our social workers
contacted the Hojos last night.

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:09.275
We'll continue
to check on Satoko

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:11.361
intermittently going forward,

00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:13.321
and we won't let
her parents mistreat her.

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:14.531
[SHION]
Her parents are dead!

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.199
She lives with her uncle!

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:18.827
You might wanna
try reading that file!

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:20.245
I apologize.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:21.955
That was a misstatement.

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:24.916
Regardless, we will ensure
she's being properly cared for.

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.086
Satoko's been doing just fine
without her uncle around!

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.797
Then one day he shows up
and grabs her off the street.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.091
How is that any different
from kidnapping?

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.635
Japanese Civil Code,
article 821.

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:36.678
As her legal guardian,

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:39.973
her uncle is granted the right
to determine Satoko's residence.

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:42.892
And who the hell let that
slimeball become her guardian?

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:44.269
[MION]
Shion.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.396
As soon as Satoko's
parents passed away,

00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:48.857
her aunt and uncle
were given custody of her.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.776
I'm not sure which article,
but it's the law.

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:54.237
[CWS WORKER]
Article 818, miss.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.572
Okay.

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.699
But her guardian, Teppei Hojo.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.451
He chose to leave her
alone for a whole year.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:03.037
Has that factored
into your response?

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:05.582
All details of the
case are confidential,

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.125
but we have inquired
as to the reason

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.210
behind his absence
during that time.

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:11.045
And his explanation
was good enough

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.548
that you decided to just
keep your people on standby?

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.633
[CWS WORKER] As I mentioned,
it's an active case.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.302
[KEIICHI] You got a report
about her aunt and uncle

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:19.304
abusing her last year.

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:22.348
That binder shoulda said
something about that, right?

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:26.102
We can't discuss
details of the case.

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:29.314
Rest assured, we are
considering all of the facts.

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:30.607
[SHION]
I know your game.

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:31.482
You're sitting on her case

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.527
because one time
she made a false report!

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:35.528
[CWS WORKER]
We're working to determine

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.655
what would best serve the child.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.115
[SHION]
Come on!

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:41.618
Stop giving us the
runaround and get her out!

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:45.038
If anything happens to her,
I'll make you all regret it!

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:47.040
[MION]
Stop, Shion.

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:50.084
That isn't gonna
get us anywhere.

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:52.754
One last thing,

00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:55.340
I don't know how her uncle
comes across on the phone,

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:56.633
but you can't trust him!

00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:59.719
Whatever he tells you,
don't believe it!

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:01.512
[CWS WORKER]
I understand your concerns.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:04.098
and I'll pass them
on to her case worker.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.310
We sincerely appreciate
you coming to talk to us.

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:09.103
Thank you for your help.

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:17.862
[SHION]
Well, she was useless.

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:20.907
That was a textbook
bureaucrat blowoff.

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:22.075
But she said
she'd pass our message

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:25.370
on to Satoko's
case worker, right?

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.830
That counts for
something, hopefully.

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:31.376
Is there a way to get in touch
with that person by ourselves?

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:32.543
I couldn't say,

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.587
but when you think about
the kind of work they do,

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:36.339
I'd have to guess we can't.

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:38.383
I mean, if we could track
down her social worker,

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:41.177
so could any deadbeat
parent with a bone to pick.

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:44.389
It's hard to make them
understand how much we care.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.431
Hey, Mion.

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:48.309
You've dealt with city
officials before, haven't you?

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:51.271
Wouldn't it be best for you
to deal with them instead of me?

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:52.188
[SHION]
They pay attention to her

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.316
when she's speaking as the
head of the Sonozaki family.

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:57.110
Without that name
to throw around,

00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:59.112
she's just some teenage girl.

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:08.371
[KEIICHI]
So, what do we do now?

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:10.373
[RIKA]
Keiichi?

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:15.336
[KEIICHI]
Sorry.

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:18.089
I was the one who
pushed you guys this far.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.675
But it's a dead end.

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:22.677
[RIKA]
That's not true.

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:24.053
You said to believe in you.

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:25.722
You'd save her no matter what.

00:13:25.763 --> 00:13:27.932
And so that's what I believed.

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.561
[RIKA]
I still believe it now.

00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:33.062
So if you're
telling me to believe

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:34.814
that you've totally
given up on Satoko,

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:37.233
and there's nothing
else we can do.

00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:39.485
I refuse!

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.195
No matter how bad things look,

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:44.032
I'll believe in you, Keiichi!

00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:45.575
Because you were
the one who told me

00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:48.369
you would tear fate
apart like wet paper!

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:50.621
Rika.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.749
[RIKA]
You can set it right.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.335
Please, help us.

00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:57.587
We have to save Satoko!

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:02.967
It's a good thing you're around

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:05.428
to talk some sense
into me, Rika.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.388
No way I can give up over this.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.307
There are people
who believe in me,

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:11.851
and I owe it to them
to keep fighting!

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:13.019
Keiichi.

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:14.896
[KEIICHI]
We can't let this get us down!

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:16.606
You guys weren't really
ready to throw in the towel

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:19.275
over one little setback, right?

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:21.027
[RENA]
Keiichi, we get it, but...

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:23.780
[KEIICHI]
If this was a club activity,

00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:26.449
you all would have
just lost the game!

00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:34.332
[MION chuckles]

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.542
Exactly right, Kei!

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:39.045
If the game's on, play to win!

00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:43.132
That's right. Fight on!

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:46.844
All right.

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:49.305
Now what are we
actually going to do?

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.893
[KEIICHI]
Listen up, guys!

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:57.355
We all need to talk
about Satoko Hojo, okay?

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:58.398
As you're all well aware,

00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:00.650
she wasn't able
to come to school today.

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:03.194
Her bastard uncle called
in to say she had a cold,

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:06.447
but we know it's a lie!

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.116
When has Satoko
ever gotten sick?

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:09.867
She could eat her
lunch off the ground

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:10.910
and not even blink!

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:13.329
Now a cold's had
her laid out for days?

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:16.249
Guys, are we really
gonna believe that?

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:16.833
Yeah, that's true!

00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:18.459
[KEIICHI]
We know what's going on here.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.421
Satoko's uncle is the
one keeping her home!

00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:24.465
We've taken our concerns
to Child Welfare Services,

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:26.300
and what do you
think they told us?

00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:28.928
They said they'd be checking
in from time to time,

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.888
and that they wouldn't be
able to tell us any details

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.766
about her case because
of confidentiality rules!

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:35.059
So, everyone,

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:36.185
what do you think?

00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:37.728
Is that okay with you?

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.814
It's not okay with me!

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.899
All of us here know
exactly how awful

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.776
her aunt and uncle
were treating her.

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:46.320
No one else knows
what she's been through!

00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:48.072
[KEIICHI]
Satoko's our classmate.

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:49.490
She's our friend!

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:51.117
You all grew up in
this room with her.

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:54.328
Her real family is right here
in this school building!

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.957
So are we gonna sit here now
and let our family suffer?

00:15:57.999 --> 00:15:59.459
I say we're not!

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.044
We're gonna help her. All of us!

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:04.881
Our club already got
the ball rolling for you.

00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:05.506
We've been working hard

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:08.676
on getting Satoko
out of that house!

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:10.803
Tomita, do you know
what we're gonna do?

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:12.930
Uh, no. No idea!

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:15.224
[KEIICHI] Well then,
let me lay it out for you!

00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:17.852
We're going to follow every
last rule down to the letter.

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:19.604
We're doing this by the book!

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.522
[MION]
That's right!

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:24.567
The best thing we can do for
her is approach this head‐on.

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:26.235
That's when we're
at our strongest!

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.488
[SHION] We don't need
underhanded tactics.

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:30.406
We'll crush them
in the open instead!

00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:32.033
[OKUMURA]
When you say "crush them."

00:16:32.074 --> 00:16:34.285
Is this like an actual fight?

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.704
This is definitely a real fight.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.208
But not with our fists and feet.

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:43.294
We're gonna fight them
using our power as citizens!

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:45.004
Our club already
launched the first strike

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:47.131
on Child Welfare Services.

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:49.509
They wrote down that five
of Satoko Hojo's classmates

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.511
showed up and asked
them to help her,

00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:53.012
then sent us home.

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:56.140
So we know exactly
what we have to do!

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:57.767
Five is not enough!

00:16:57.808 --> 00:16:59.018
If we're gonna save her,

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.895
we're gonna need
all of your help!

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:01.687
We're gonna show them

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:03.147
that we're the
Hinamizawa School,

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:04.857
and we mean business!

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:07.443
[KIDS cheer]

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:10.112
[CHIE]
Maebara. Are you...

00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:12.532
[RIKA]
Chie.

00:17:12.573 --> 00:17:13.658
[CHIE]
Ms. Furude!

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:16.536
What is going on in there?

00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:17.745
They're all doing
whatever they can

00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:20.289
to make sure Satoko can be safe.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.959
I lack the power
to do anything for her

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.878
without all of them by my side.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.713
But if you plan on
trying to stop them,

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:30.466
I can stand in
your way if nothing else!

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:34.136
I understand.

00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:38.182
So please, just try not
to let anybody get hurt, okay?

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:40.017
Will you promise me?

00:17:41.352 --> 00:17:43.187
Thank you so much!

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:44.313
[KEIICHI]
Okay, everyone!

00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:47.149
After school,
we all head for Okinomiya!

00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:48.818
[KIDS]
Yeah!

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:50.069
[CHIE]
Wait.

00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:53.531
[KEIICHI]
Ms. Chie.

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:55.366
Are you gonna try
to get in our way?

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:58.202
[CHIE]
No.

00:17:58.244 --> 00:18:00.580
If you would have me,
I'll join you.

00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:02.248
Is that okay?

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:05.626
[KIDS cheer]

00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:07.753
[OFFICIAL]
Oh, wow.

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:10.089
Well, what can
we do for you today?

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:11.716
We came here to help
you fully understand

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:14.510
the urgency of
Satoko Hojo's case.

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:15.303
I see.

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:17.221
And how many
people did you bring?

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.265
The whole
Hinamizawa School's here,

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:20.308
with our teacher.

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:22.560
We're 16 altogether.

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:24.228
[HARAYAMA]
Now, let's begin.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.188
I've been made aware
that you've raised concerns

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.066
that Satoko Hojo's living
situation is dangerous enough

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:32.153
to warrant intervention
by Child Welfare Services.

00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:34.322
And in response,
our office informed you

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:36.574
that her case is not
merely being monitored,

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:39.076
but rather is actively
under investigation.

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:40.328
Have you considered
that her uncle

00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:44.248
already has a prior record
of abuse from last year?

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.875
[HARAYAMA]
Pursuant to this.

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:46.834
According to our records,

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:49.128
an investigation
conducted last year turned up

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.173
no evidence of wrongdoing
by Teppei Hojo personally.

00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:53.215
What?

00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:55.468
[HARAYAMA] We did receive
corroborating reports

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:58.804
involving Satoko
and her late aunt Tamae.

00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:00.848
But we have no indication
that Teppei was involved

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.392
in those incidents,
even within those reports.

00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:05.353
Even then,
maybe her aunt's behavior

00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:07.355
was just what
people noticed more!

00:19:07.396 --> 00:19:08.606
Possibly.

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:10.441
I can leave a note here
for her case worker

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:13.486
to give extra scrutiny
to Teppei Hojo's behavior.

00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:15.404
[SHION] You might also
mention that he abandoned her

00:19:15.446 --> 00:19:17.198
for an entire year.

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:19.492
We were told that a lack
of adequate job opportunities

00:19:19.533 --> 00:19:21.452
forced Teppei Hojo
to search elsewhere

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:25.039
for income to provide
for Satoko's needs.

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:25.956
What's more,

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:29.251
we asked Satoko directly
about the alleged abuse.

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:31.295
She denied everything outright.

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:33.005
Accordingly,
Child Welfare Services

00:19:33.047 --> 00:19:35.716
has no grounds to intervene.

00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:41.681
We sincerely hope
you'll continue

00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:43.683
to support Satoko
however you can,

00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:45.601
including helping
her adjust to her new life

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:47.937
in her uncle Teppei's home.

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:51.440
[SHION]
Screw you.

00:19:51.482 --> 00:19:53.609
Have you listened to a
single damn word we said?

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:55.403
Any of it?

00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:57.196
[HARAYAMA] I understand
your frustration, and again,

00:19:57.238 --> 00:19:59.573
your testimony will
not be set aside.

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:04.537
We are actively
pursuing Satoko's case.

00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:05.830
[RIKA] Then will you
take responsibility

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:08.165
if something happens
to her in the meantime?

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:09.041
[SHION]
You will!

00:20:09.083 --> 00:20:11.335
If Teppei leaves the
tiniest scratch on her,

00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:12.670
you'll all bleed for it!

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:14.714
[CHIE]
Shion, stop.

00:20:15.506 --> 00:20:17.550
That's too far.

00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:24.974
Well, sir, can you tell us

00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:27.643
when we should
expect a final decision?

00:20:27.685 --> 00:20:28.644
As we've established,

00:20:28.686 --> 00:20:30.271
it will take some
time to thoroughly

00:20:30.312 --> 00:20:32.148
review all the
facts in this matter,

00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:33.816
but I do hope you're
all at least satisfied

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:37.403
that we are genuinely looking
out for your friend's wellbeing.

00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:41.574
[SHION] It's like the
dam war all over again, huh?

00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:43.367
[MION]
Just like it.

00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:44.577
Though when that was going on,

00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:47.913
all these kids would've
been babies, if that.

00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:51.917
Community spirit is what
let Hinamizawa survive.

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:54.044
[MION]
One enemy faces two of us.

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:57.631
We meet two of them with
four and meet four with eight.

00:20:57.673 --> 00:21:00.968
A thousand‐man army will
face the entire village.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:02.553
Who said that?

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:03.763
Well,

00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:06.265
I believe that was
our demon hag grandma.

00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:08.601
That makes sense.

00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:11.979
With big enough numbers,
you can overwhelm any enemy.

00:21:12.021 --> 00:21:14.398
[TOMITA]
Maebara!

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.317
I don't think
Child Welfare Services

00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:19.028
is gonna get Satoko
the help she needs.

00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:20.613
It really sucks, but yeah.

00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:21.989
Doesn't look like it.

00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:23.407
We live near the Hojos,

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:26.619
and we've seen just
how awful her uncle can be!

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.746
We can't give up
while she's trapped there!

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:29.872
Our friend is in trouble

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:31.624
and we have to keep
doing everything we can

00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:34.043
until we know for
sure that she's safe!

00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:35.878
[KIDS]
Yeah, that's right!

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:38.839
Good, we're all in!

00:21:38.881 --> 00:21:41.592
Everyone, let's pick
this thing back up tomorrow!

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:43.219
Twenty just won't be enough.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.262
Let's try to get 60 people here!

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:47.056
[KIDS]
Yeah!

00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:49.391
I'll ask anybody
who might come out!

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:54.605
[BOY]
Anything we can do to help!

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:04.740
[RIKA]
It's here.

00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:06.909
The power to tear fate apart.

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:08.202
This is it!

00:23:53.015 --> 00:23:55.976
[RIKA] Next time:
<i>Tataridamashi‐hen</i>, Part 4.
