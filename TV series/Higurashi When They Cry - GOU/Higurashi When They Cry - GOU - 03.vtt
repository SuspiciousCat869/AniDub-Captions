WEBVTT

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:22.100
[AUDIENCE applauds]

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.101
Now, let's go, Satoko!

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.895
[SATOKO] Why must you
insist on dragging me around

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:27.397
like I'm a little child?

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.566
[RENA]
We should go too, Keiichi.

00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:31.693
Okay, but where's
everyone going?

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:32.444
The river.

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:34.071
It's cotton‐drifting time!

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.374
Cotton?

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.919
Since it's your
first time doing it,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.047
feel free to watch me
and follow along.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.847
That's how the
basic movements go,

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:01.515
and you repeat them

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.892
while offering thanks
to Lord Oyashiro.

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:05.227
Lord Oyashiro?

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:07.688
It's the guardian
deity of Hinamizawa.

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.692
That's why it's so important
that we all pay our respects.

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:16.571
Thank you, our Lord Oyashiro.
Thank you, our Lord Oyashiro.

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:19.116
A guardian deity?

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.883
And that's the ritual!

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:39.511
I guess we should go catch up
with Mion and the others.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:40.262
Sounds good.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:41.596
I'm sure they're not far.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:42.848
I'll go find them!

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.307
Hey, wait up!

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.268
[RENA]
Don't worry, I'm fine!

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.647
Come on.

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:58.655
Huh?

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:00.282
Tomitake!

00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:05.120
Well, I wouldn't
want to interrupt.

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:22.888
[CHIE]
Pardon me, Maebara.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:23.764
Huh?

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.640
Hi, Ms. Chie. What's up?

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.350
There's someone waiting
at the front gate

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.394
who says he would
like to see you.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.396
What? Who is it?

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:33.815
Oh?

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.361
I presume I'm speaking
to Mister Keiichi Maebara?

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:39.654
Yeah, that's me.

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:41.281
And who are you, exactly?

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:43.200
[OOISHI] Gotta say,
I don't care for the heat.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.159
Huh?

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:44.910
If you don't mind,

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.369
I'd prefer to have
this conversation

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:49.122
in my air‐conditioned car.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:50.290
Hold on.

00:04:50.332 --> 00:04:51.333
Don't worry, son.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:53.543
I'm not gonna
drive off with you.

00:04:57.506 --> 00:04:59.674
[OOISHI] Let me know if
the AC is too much.

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:00.759
I tend to keep my car

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:03.094
a bit cooler than
a lot of people like.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:06.097
Sure. So what are
we talking about?

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.725
[OOISHI] I was hoping I could
ask you about somebody.

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:10.602
Namely, the man
in this photograph.

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:11.895
[KEIICHI]
Tomitake, right?

00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:13.730
[OOISHI]
Ah, so you're familiar with him.

00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:14.898
[KEIICHI]
And?

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.275
[OOISHI] Tomitake was
seen there speaking with you

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:20.987
and your classmates at the
Watanagashi Festival last night.

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:24.157
But we'll come back to that.

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:25.700
Now, what about this woman?

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.411
I saw her with him last night.

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:30.664
That was the first time
I've seen her, though.

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:32.791
And when was the
last time you saw them?

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:36.044
[KEIICHI] At the very end, when
the festival was winding down,

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:37.462
but I didn't talk to them.

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:40.173
And did anything about them
strike you as unusual,

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:41.758
or cause for concern?

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:44.094
What is this really about?

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:45.762
What's going on?

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.391
[OOISHI] I'll be happy
to answer your question

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:52.394
just as soon as you
answer one more for me.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.521
A slightly more personal one.

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:56.815
Do you believe in curses,
Mister Maebara?

00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:57.941
I don't...

00:05:57.983 --> 00:06:00.610
I'm not a little kid, so why
would I believe in curses?

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.654
[OOISHI]
I was hoping you'd say that.

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:05.574
You grew up in the city,
so you see things differently.

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.576
What's that have
to do with anything?

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:08.660
[OOISHI] You see,
out here in the boonies,

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:11.371
it's not unusual
to believe in curses.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:13.748
The curse of
Oyashiro for instance.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.208
Oyashiro?

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.586
That's how the basic movements
go, and you repeat them

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.297
while offering thanks
to Lord Oyashiro.

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:24.134
It all began four years ago.

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:27.387
A violent incident at the
Hinamizawa Dam building site.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.890
You may have seen
the story in the news.

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.934
The victim was the
construction manager on the dam.

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:35.645
He was murdered and carved up
by six of the workers.

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:37.522
[gasps]

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:39.357
From that magazine.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.359
[OOISHI] Five of the
perpetrators were caught,

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:44.070
but the apparent ringleader
was never found.

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:45.155
He's been missing ever since,

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:47.032
along with the
victim's right arm.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:47.866
And what?

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:50.493
That happened because
of Oyashiro's curse?

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:54.623
I'm still not done telling
the story, Mister Maebara.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:55.373
The next year,

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.959
one of the villagers who'd
supported the dam project died

00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:00.795
while he was on vacation
with his family.

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:04.382
He fell in a river, got swept
away by the rapids and drowned.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.384
His wife didn't
come back either.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:09.137
It's generally believed
she drowned along with him,

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:12.390
but nobody ever found
the body to prove it.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.558
The year after that,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.811
the head priest at the local
shrine passed away unexpectedly

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.521
from a sudden illness.

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:19.397
And on that same day,

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:22.859
his wife threw herself
into the bog and drowned.

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:23.860
The same day.

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:24.986
That's awful.

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:27.530
[OOISHI] The pattern
continued for a fourth year.

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.950
That's last year,
if you weren't keeping track.

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:33.161
A woman was found beaten
to death out in the woods.

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:35.080
So someone dies
every year for four years,

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:37.165
and everyone
blames it on a curse?

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.291
It could be a coincidence!

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:40.293
[OOISHI]
Mister Maebara, please.

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:41.419
Whatever it is,

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:44.381
it's definitely safe to rule
out sheer coincidence.

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:45.548
All of these incidents happened

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.635
on the day of the
Watanagashi festival.

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:53.431
Someone's dying on
the same day every year.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:56.434
The same day every year?

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:57.769
[OOISHI]
Each of the past four years,

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.438
the folks in Hinamizawa
lost one of their own

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.899
mysteriously during Watanagashi.

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:05.652
And the curse of Lord Oyashiro
is as good an explanation

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:07.862
as anyone's been
able to come up with.

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:09.864
[KEIICHI]
So, this year too?

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:12.117
[OOISHI] The man and
woman in these photos.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.953
I'm afraid they went
missing last night.

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.832
Of course, the police are
doing everything in our power

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.000
to find them,

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:22.794
but nobody's seen a trace of
either one since the festival.

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:23.878
There's a lot of
ground to cover,

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.714
and we don't know
where to start.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:28.258
But how do you know
they didn't just get a room?

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:30.010
It hasn't even been a day!

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.803
[OOISHI]
The woman's name is Takano,

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.722
and we've located her car.

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:35.265
Parked at the festival grounds,

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:37.392
exactly where she
would have left it.

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:39.561
And Tomitake's folding bike.

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:40.770
You know the one.

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:44.024
Also present and accounted for.

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.150
Given the circumstances,

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:48.486
it only makes sense for us
to treat them as disappearances.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:51.406
Like I told you, we're
digging as hard as we can.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.953
Thing is, folks in Hinamizawa
don't care to talk about

00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:59.873
bad things happening on
the night of Watanagashi.

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:02.459
[KEIICHI] So you're asking
the new guy in town?

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.626
[OOISHI] The rest of
the villagers would be

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:07.547
perfectly happy to write off
Jiro Tomitake and Miyo Takano

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:10.675
as just two more casualties
of Lord Oyashiro's curse.

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.427
That's messed up.

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:13.428
Ignoring it.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.013
You're preaching
to the choir, son.

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:18.308
It was a crime,
not a damn curse!

00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:20.310
Excuse me.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:24.939
[OOISHI] But yeah, that's
exactly why I'm asking you.

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:27.233
I need someone who
isn't scared of the curse,

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:28.902
and so do those two.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:29.736
Okay.

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:32.447
I wanna help you out,
but I'm not sure how to do it.

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:33.573
Simple enough.

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:36.534
Just go on about your life,
but keep an eye 'n ear out,

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.871
and let me know if you
hear anything about this.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.247
Here's my direct number.

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:42.749
Keep it to yourself.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.585
And I'm gonna
need you to keep quiet

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:48.129
about our conversation
today as well.

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:50.298
Not a single word to anyone.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.549
[KEIICHI]
Got it.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:52.675
To be clear,

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.636
I'm telling you not
to mention any of this

00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:57.555
to Mion Sonozaki
or your other friends.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.015
What does that mean?

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:01.559
Are you trying to say they have
something to do with all this?

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:03.186
No, not at all.

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:06.106
But, the problem is
that can't be ruled out.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:08.441
We just don't know enough.

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:10.902
And if anyone in
Hinamizawa hears we talked,

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:13.321
it'll get a lot harder
to find out more.

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:15.657
Hey, just think of it this way.

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:18.159
Your neighbors are already
scared of the curse,

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:21.121
and there's no need to give them
anything else to worry about.

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:23.540
You're really
doing them a favor.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.793
I guess that's fair.

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:27.752
So, Mister‐‐

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:31.005
Ooishi with the
Okinomiya PD, or "Kura."

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.299
Not a stickler for
titles and all that.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:36.219
[KEIICHI]
All right then, Mister Ooishi.

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:40.306
Then I suppose we'll be speaking
together soon, Mister Maebara.

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:52.735
I see it now.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:55.280
It was in the lounge;
the weapon was a rope!

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:58.491
Well done, Rena!

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:00.118
You're quite skilled,
aren't you?

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.953
So whodunnit then?

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:04.789
And the culprit was Mion, right?

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.542
[laughs]
Nope, nice try!

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:10.086
Awooo!

00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:11.004
[SATOKO]
Are you even familiar

00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:13.298
with the word
"punctuality," Keiichi?

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:15.633
I am barely keeping
my anger in check.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.051
Yeah. Sorry,

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:19.220
I got stuck in the office
longer than I thought I'd be.

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:22.223
Did you do something bad
to get called in there?

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:23.391
[giggles]

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:25.602
It's okay, I forgive you!

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.729
Honestly, the game was
so heated without you

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.648
I didn't even notice
you weren't here, Kei.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.943
Rena lost though, so today's
penalty will be on her.

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:34.903
Awooo...

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:36.279
And you, too!

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:37.071
How's that work?

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:39.949
Failing to show means you
forfeit, which means you lose!

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:41.743
You should accept your fate.

00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:42.869
Ah, dangit.

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:44.704
So what's the penalty for today?

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:47.832
Today, you're gonna be
on gofer duty, kids.

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:49.667
Grab the stuff on this list.

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.088
[RENA]
Uh... So we need tofu.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:54.881
Mirin.

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:55.423
Hey!

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.300
You're just sending us
to buy your groceries!

00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:58.801
[MION]
What's club rule number seven?

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:02.889
The loser carries out their
punishment, no matter what!

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:12.815
Dammit!

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:24.827
[yawns]

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:26.913
That's a pretty
big yawn, Keiichi!

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:30.083
I may have stayed up a
little too late watching TV.

00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:31.292
What about lunch?

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:33.962
[KEIICHI] I think I'm
gonna take a nap instead.

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:36.089
Really? I wouldn't expect
you to willingly present

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.424
such an easy target!

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.551
Don't mess with me, all right?

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.512
I'm being serious.

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:44.055
Well, fine.

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:46.849
Just suck the fun out
of the room, then.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.977
[RENA]
Huh? How long has it been?

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:51.729
Well, no one saw
them the day after,

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.774
so it had to have been
the night of Watanagashi.

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:57.318
[RENA] Would it have
taken both of them?

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.861
[MION] I can't say for sure,

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:01.990
but it seems like
the curse has struck again.

00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:04.367
You think it was Lord Oyashiro?

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:06.369
It does fit that
pattern, doesn't it?

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.204
Yeah, everything about it.

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:10.957
They might have
been demoned away.

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:21.467
[KEIICHI]
That's suspicious.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:24.554
What could it mean,
"demoned away"?

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:26.514
Mister Maebara!

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:28.182
Fancy meeting you here.

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:29.726
[KEIICHI]
Mister Ooishi?

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:30.768
Great timing.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.229
I was hoping
we could talk a bit.

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.697
Here you go, sir. Enjoy!

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:48.953
[OOISHI] So, what do
you think of this place?

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:51.122
Oh. Well, it's... Um...

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.416
Just about everyone
in town loves it here.

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:56.252
If we're being honest,
the food is nothing too special.

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:57.837
But the scenery's great.

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.297
[KEIICHI]
Hey. Mister Ooishi?

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.007
[OOISHI]
Hmm?

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:04.052
What would it mean if
somebody was "demoned away"?

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:05.219
[OOISHI]
Hmm...

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:07.221
That's another folksy
local euphemism

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:08.556
for bad things happening.

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.558
When someone disappears
without a trace,

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.144
the villagers say a
demon came for them.

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:16.272
Like a worse version of
a spirit leading them off.

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:17.648
Is that right?

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.777
[OOISHI] You know, ages ago,
back in feudal times,

00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:23.363
travelers were scared
to death of Hinamizawa.

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:24.947
They thought it was
a demon village.

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:25.990
Seriously?

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:27.492
As in, demons from Hell?

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:28.701
Not exactly.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.745
More like the flesh‐eating kind.

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:33.956
The sort of monsters you might
read about in a folktale.

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:37.460
They show up, and just start
devouring people left and right.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.588
[OOISHI] Anyway, what
leads you to ask about it?

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.924
I overheard Rena
and Mion talking.

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:44.467
They were saying it
had something to do

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:47.261
with the curse of Oyashiro.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:49.055
Remember the first incident?

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:50.640
I told you about it, right?

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:54.185
Yeah, you did, you had said one
of the killers was never found.

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:55.353
[OOISHI]
And the natural assumption is

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.105
that he's still on the run,

00:14:57.146 --> 00:14:59.941
but another theory holds that
he was taken by the demons.

00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:00.775
Huh?

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:02.485
[OOISHI] The next year's
victims are both believed

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:03.486
to have drowned,

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:06.531
but again, only the
husband's body was discovered.

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:08.157
[KEIICHI]
What about the year after that?

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:10.284
We know two people
died then, right?

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:12.203
[OOISHI] That's our best guess,
Mister Maebara,

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:13.329
but we don't know.

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:15.623
We found the wife's sandals
and a suicide note.

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:16.666
No corpse.

00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:18.292
Well, last year was
just the one woman

00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:20.586
who was killed in
the woods, wasn't it?

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:22.296
[OOISHI] And we caught
the guy who did it, too.

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:24.048
Some lowlife junky.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.385
But it so happens that junky
had a kid under his care,

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.887
and that kid disappeared
after the arrest.

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:32.390
Okay, but if you caught
the guy who murdered the woman,

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:34.851
there's no way they can claim
some curse killed her!

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:36.018
[OOISHI]
Of course not.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.854
But later, when
he died in police custody,

00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:41.649
they pinned that
on Lord Oyashiro.

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:43.776
Just like this.

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:46.112
Shiv to the throat.

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:48.948
So what you're saying is every
year fits the same pattern.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.949
One person turns up dead,

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:52.243
then someone involved
with them disappears.

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:53.870
[OOISHI]
That's about the size of it.

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:55.788
I asked Rena and Mion both,

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.207
and they never said a thing
to me about any of that.

00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:00.168
Did something bad happen?

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:02.003
Like at the building site.

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:04.380
Maybe, an accident, or‐‐

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:06.215
I don't know.

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:07.300
Rena.

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:08.009
[OOISHI]
I would assume

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.428
they just didn't wanna give
you a reason to worry,

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.555
especially if you
consider the timing.

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:14.140
Huh?

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:16.017
The curse kills
someone each year,

00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:18.519
and somebody else gets
snatched up by the demons.

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:21.147
Technically we're still
waiting right now,

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:23.483
to learn what happened to who.

00:16:23.524 --> 00:16:25.026
[gasps]

00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:31.991
[RENA] I didn't realize
your dad was an artist, Keiichi!

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:32.825
[KEIICHI]
Yep.

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:34.285
You should see our house.

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:37.497
His studio is swallowing it
all up one room at a time.

00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:39.540
Well, now I really wanna see it.

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.876
I bet I would find
something super kyute!

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:43.503
Awoo!

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:46.839
I have a question.

00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:48.758
Have you guys been lying
to me about anything

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:50.593
or keeping something
hidden from me?

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:53.304
[RENA]
Huh? We would never do that!

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:54.889
Yes, you would.

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:57.141
[RENA]
Keiichi, why would you say that?

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:58.100
It's the truth!

00:16:58.142 --> 00:16:59.310
You never said a word about‐‐

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:01.521
Okay. How 'bout you?

00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:03.022
Fair's fair, isn't it?

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:04.607
So what are you not telling me?

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:06.734
We're friends, aren't we?

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:07.944
So have you lied?

00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:09.278
Have you been lying to me

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.988
or keeping something
hidden from me?

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.989
Of course not.

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:13.533
I've always been
honest with you.

00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:14.492
That's a lie.

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:15.743
Why do you think I'm lying?

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:16.953
[RENA]
Because I saw it.

00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:18.955
You hid something
from me at the junkyard.

00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:21.374
Something you didn't
want me knowing you'd seen.

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:22.166
Hold on.

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:23.125
[RENA] And you lied
about where you were

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:24.418
during the club meeting.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.754
You didn't really go to the
teacher's office, did you?

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:27.421
How do you‐‐

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:29.757
[RENA] You were outside
in a car talking to someone.

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:31.926
An older man I didn't recognize.

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:33.844
Now, who was he, that man?

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.680
I didn't catch his name, but‐‐

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:38.558
And why would a total stranger
come to talk with you at school?

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:40.101
What, how would I know that?

00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:42.270
Well, you know what
you talked about, don't you?

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:44.188
It had nothing to do with you!

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.648
You liar!

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:51.362
I worked super hard
like they all told me to.

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.114
Some people have to put
everything they have

00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:55.575
into life to feel a
little happiness, Keiichi.

00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:57.702
Do you realize that?

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.161
And I've tried so hard.

00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:02.290
I have been trying my hardest
for so much of my life.

00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:11.465
So then, we've both got things
we won't tell each other,

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:13.718
and there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:18:15.678 --> 00:18:16.762
'Kay?

00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:19.015
Now let's go,
it's getting chilly.

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:31.152
[ICHIRO]
Keiichi!

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.364
Someone from the bookstore
is calling you.

00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:37.617
The bookstore?

00:18:37.658 --> 00:18:39.076
This is Keiichi.

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:39.702
[OOISHI]
Good evening,

00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:42.455
it's Ooishi from the
Okinomiya Police.

00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:45.750
Please accept my apologies for
bothering you at this late hour.

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:47.251
[KEIICHI]
Mister Ooishi?

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.795
[OOISHI] And I should also
apologize for the cover story.

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:50.963
When your parents picked up,

00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:53.883
I had to tell them I was
from the bookstore.

00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:56.010
Okay, wait just a minute.

00:18:56.719 --> 00:18:58.137
[OOISHI]
I wanted to give you an update.

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:01.098
I did a bit of digging after
our conversation earlier,

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.934
and I learned some things
that might be relevant.

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:05.353
Digging where?

00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:08.230
[OOISHI] Into your friend
Reina Ryugu's story.

00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:10.858
Honestly, it's not a very
exciting one all‐in‐all.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.486
If you find yourself starting
to doze off halfway,

00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:16.113
let me know and
I'll spare you the rest.

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.074
I'd like to hear it.

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:19.075
[OOISHI]
Up until last year,

00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:22.536
Miss Ryugu lived in a suburb
in Ibaraki prefecture.

00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:25.206
Yeah, she told me she'd
just moved here recently.

00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:27.291
[OOISHI]
Huh. I looked into that,

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:29.085
and something
caught my attention.

00:19:29.126 --> 00:19:32.171
It seems that shortly before
transferring here to Hinamizawa,

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:35.383
she got herself
suspended from school.

00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:37.426
From what I found, she made
her way around campus

00:19:37.468 --> 00:19:39.553
and smashed every
window in the place.

00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:40.596
[KEIICHI]
Really?

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:42.807
[OOISHI] They diagnosed
her with dysautonomia,

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:44.600
root cause not known.

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.143
Started her on nerve medication

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:48.771
and got her into
psychological counseling.

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:50.981
I was able to get hold
of the therapist's notes

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:53.442
from those counseling
sessions, and again,

00:19:53.484 --> 00:19:57.113
please feel free to stop me
if you feel yourself fading.

00:19:57.154 --> 00:20:00.074
But there was one name
that she kept bringing up.

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:01.492
[KEIICHI]
What was it?

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:04.036
[OOISHI]
The name of Lord Oyashiro.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:06.997
Thank you, our Lord Oyashiro.

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:08.833
[OOISHI]
It appears to have been ongoing.

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:11.752
She spoke of Lord Oyashiro
appearing every night.

00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:15.172
She'd wake up, and a spirit
would be standing over her,

00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:17.425
as if it was watching her sleep.

00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:18.300
But how?

00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:20.386
She just recently
moved to Hinamizawa.

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:22.012
Where would she
have heard the name?

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:24.056
[OOISHI] Oh, right, I hadn't
mentioned that I looked

00:20:24.098 --> 00:20:27.309
into her family's
residency records.

00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:28.769
And I found another wrinkle.

00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:31.272
They moved to Ibaraki
from Hinamizawa.

00:20:31.313 --> 00:20:32.106
They left the village

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:35.401
right after she finished
elementary school.

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:37.945
She's from Hinamizawa.

00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:40.156
[OOISHI] Are you still
with me, Mister Maebara?

00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:42.116
Maybe we should call it here.

00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:44.827
[ICHIRO]
Hey, Keiichi!

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:47.288
Open up, I got something for ya.

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:49.665
Excuse me, my dad
is calling for me.

00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:50.624
[OOISHI]
That's fine.

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:52.001
We're at a good stopping point.

00:20:52.042 --> 00:20:53.252
Sorry to keep you.

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:55.379
Let me know if you
hear anything else.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.050
[ICHIRO]
Come on, Keiichi, open the door!

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:03.053
Your poor ol' dad's arms
are gonna fall off!

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:07.224
[KEIICHI] You brought up
the fancy tea set?

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:09.727
You know I was
a teenager too, once.

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:12.104
What does that have
to do with anything?

00:21:12.146 --> 00:21:14.106
Quit acting like she's not here.

00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:16.108
She's not! Who's "she"?

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.277
Seriously, you can
stop acting coy.

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:21.572
Rena came to hang with you,
and she wasn't shy about it.

00:21:23.574 --> 00:21:25.075
You're telling me you saw her?

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:25.868
Yeah, of course.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:26.911
She showed up and said hi,

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:29.789
and I told her to go ahead and
meet you in your room upstairs.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.707
When did you talk to her?

00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:32.458
I don't know.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.544
A few minutes after
you got that phone call?

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:42.051
[ICHIRO]
Wha... Hey, Keiichi?

00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:48.182
Rena was here,
she came to my house.

00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:55.898
And my dad told her
where my room is.

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:07.910
[KAIICHI] She heard me
talking to Mister Ooishi.

00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:56.060
[RIKA] Next time,
<i>Onidamashi‐hen</i>, Part 4.
