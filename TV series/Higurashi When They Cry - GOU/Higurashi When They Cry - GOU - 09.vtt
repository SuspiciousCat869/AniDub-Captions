WEBVTT

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:30.072
[doorbell rings repeatedly]

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:31.949
[LANDLADY]
Hello? I know you're in there!

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.827
[knocking]

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.288
[TEPPEI]
Ugh! Go away!

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:40.958
[LANDLADY] The other
tenants have complained

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:44.795
about the smell
coming from your unit!

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:46.672
[TEPPEI]
Hey, I said piss off.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.924
What the hell
do you want me to do?

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.926
Stop making up
excuses to rag on me,

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:53.220
and mind your own
goddamn business!

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:58.100
You nosy dumb‐ass bitch!

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.533
[SATOKO]
Wow, what a feast.

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.618
That's a super fancy‐looking
spread you have

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.953
over there, Mion!

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:20.247
[RIKA] It's packed with
a ton of different goodies!

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:21.331
What a treat!

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:22.291
[MION]
I know, right?

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:23.875
The mayor and
his friends came by

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.127
for drinks and food last night.

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:27.337
So, I stole a
few of their leftovers.

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:28.338
[chuckles]

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.756
I guess that's why
your lunch seems to be

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:31.592
mostly snack‐type stuff, then.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:32.634
Go figure.

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:34.386
I should've known
you were the type of girl

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:38.307
who could whip up table scraps
into something this delicious.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:41.727
What you brought for lunch today
looks really tasty too, Rena!

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:42.686
[RENA]
Thanks.

00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:45.647
It's not as nice as Mion's,
but it's kinda cute, right?

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.649
[MION]
C'mon, you cook with love.

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:50.027
My grub doesn't measure up
to yours at all!

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:53.030
We should strive to learn from
the brilliant examples they set.

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.114
[KEIICHI]
Huh...

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.199
So, what did you guys
bring to eat?

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.075
[RIKA]
Ta‐dah!

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:57.784
[KEIICHI]
Whoa!

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.453
[SATOKO laughs]

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:02.539
We received some excellent meat
from a neighbor of ours.

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.458
[KEIICHI] I thought it'd
end up protein heavy,

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.585
but it's actually
pretty well‐balanced!

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:08.503
Someday you are going
to make your husband

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:10.339
a very happy man, Rika!

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.759
I'll maintain a tight grip on
both his heart and his stomach.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.762
[KEIICHI sighs]
Satoko, on the other hand...

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.430
What is that supposed to mean?

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.182
Maybe I'm not quite
as skilled as Rika is,

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:22.392
but I can still hold
my own in the kitchen!

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:23.727
[KEIICHI]
Ok.

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.562
Well, then, can you
tell me the difference

00:02:25.604 --> 00:02:28.190
between broccoli
and cauliflower?

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:33.153
That's easy.
Broccoli is green, obviously.

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:34.446
Wait, that's wrong.

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:37.157
The yellow one is... Um...

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.952
[KEIICHI] Go on.
What color is broccoli again?

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.665
[cries]

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:48.835
You're being such a meanie!

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.337
If you're gonna tease
her about her skills,

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.215
then you had better
be a brilliant chef, Kei.

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:56.093
Uh. Well, I know I definitely
have to be better at cooking

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:59.012
than Satoko,
even if it's just her.

00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:00.430
Excuse me?

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:01.014
Yeah?

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.641
In that case,
why don't you try showing us

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:06.061
how you throw down
at lunchtime tomorrow?

00:03:06.103 --> 00:03:07.062
No cheating.

00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:09.773
Don't even think about having
someone else cook for you!

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:12.693
[SATOKO]
Oh my!

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.903
That sounds like a
worthwhile challenge to me.

00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:16.822
Think you're up for it?

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.075
Okay then, it's official!

00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:23.662
I'm gonna bring a lunch that'll
knock your damn socks off!

00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:25.247
This is so exciting!

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.708
I can't wait to see
what you both bring!

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.460
[MOEKO]
"Dear Keiichi.

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:32.879
Your father and I had
to leave for Tokyo.

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:35.090
Something urgent
came up at work.

00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:37.050
We're gone for
the next few days.

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:40.595
So, now's your chance to learn
how to fend for yourself!"

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:46.351
[KEIICHI] Great! Of all
the times, why now?

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:49.813
Fine, here we go!
I can manage on my own!

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:53.608
Time to cook up a storm, baby!

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.576
What am I gonna do?

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:03.452
This one.

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:06.288
Any idiot can
fry things in a pan!

00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:10.292
[KEIICHI]
Next!

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:14.171
"Add a teaspoon of oil"?

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:15.881
The heck is a teaspoon?

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:18.967
There!

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:23.889
Yeah! Now that's how it's done!

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.850
[SATOKO] Have you
completely lost your mind?

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:36.902
[KEIICHI groans]
Huh?

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:39.488
Satoko? Rika?

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.573
Huh. What're you two doing here?

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:43.158
This is trespassing!

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.826
Don't accuse us of
committing a crime

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:47.788
while you're over
here playing arsonist!

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:49.456
[KEIICHI]
No way.

00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:50.999
I was about
to burn my house down?

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.001
[SATOKO] That's exactly
what would've happened!

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:54.711
[RIKA] If we weren't
passing by just now,

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:58.965
your house would be like "fwoom"
with sirens going "woo woo"!

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:01.092
This is humiliating.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.344
There, there Keiichi.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:03.637
It's okay.

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.138
[SATOKO]
I should've known.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.097
Here I was wondering

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.309
if you'd be able to back up
all that bragging.

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.311
[sighs]

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:14.689
All right. Please step
aside, Keiichi.

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:16.274
What now?

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:20.403
Just be quiet and wait on
the sofa like a good boy, okay?

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.406
[SATOKO sighs]

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:27.118
What is it about men that makes
them so careless sometimes?

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:31.164
Hey. If you have time
to sit around doing nothing,

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:33.917
then you might
as well set the table!

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:35.252
[KEIICHI]
I'm on it.

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:37.712
[RIKA]
It's almost time for us to eat.

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.549
I'm glad we're having
dinner together like this.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.259
Ni‐pah!

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.178
At least one of you
two's in a good mood.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.222
Wish the other one
wasn't so mad.

00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:49.474
[RIKA]
She's not.

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:50.809
You've got it mixed up.

00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:52.310
Satoko's not mad.

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:55.438
Actually, she's having a
lot of fun doing this for you.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.859
[SATOKO] Honestly.
Who messes up a stir‐fry?

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.986
[KEIICHI]
Fun, eh. I dunno.

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.070
[RIKA]
This is what she was like

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:04.030
back when she was
around her nii‐nii.

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:05.156
Her what?

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.199
[RIKA]
Her nii‐nii.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:07.325
It's a nickname.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:10.036
That's what Satoko calls
her big brother, Satoshi.

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.664
Huh, I didn't know she had one.

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:14.875
First time I've heard about it.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.627
Being with Satoshi
made her happy like this.

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.546
She knew she could
always depend on him

00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:22.674
when she needed it the most.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:25.010
Hold on,
what do you mean "knew"?

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.261
Is he gone?

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.849
[SATOKO]
Food's on the table!

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:31.850
Keiichi.

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:34.102
Where do you guys
keep your rice paddle?

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.023
There. Dinner is served!

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.566
Boy, am I hungry!

00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:41.693
Thanks for cooking, Satoko!

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.827
[KEIICHI]
This rice is perfectly fluffy.

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.704
The miso soup's great, too!

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.372
[laughs]

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:56.166
Someone's had a change of heart!

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:57.000
[KEIICHI]
Yep.

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:58.960
I underestimated you.

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:04.966
You win, hands down.

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:08.470
Uh, that's really nice of you.

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:11.473
But it's nothing
all that extravagant.

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:12.515
[SATOKO]
The only thing I made

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.684
from scratch were
the rice and soup.

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:17.729
All of the side dishes
came straight from the can.

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:20.315
[KEIICHI] Listen,
there's nothing wrong with that.

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:23.693
This is still an amazing meal!

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:26.237
It's not the most impressive
thing I've ever made,

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.697
but as long as you
admit that I know

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:31.409
what I'm doing in the kitchen,
I guess it'll do for tonight.

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:34.079
This is so great.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.830
It reminds me of the
times we'd eat dinner

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:39.084
with Satoshi and how
much fun we would have.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:43.421
Yeah, I know what you mean.

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:44.756
Thinking about
that makes me wonder

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:47.801
what he's doing right now.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:51.513
Uh! I should mention
that Satoshi is my nii‐nii.

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:52.514
Sorry.

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:54.724
I mean he's my big brother!

00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:57.894
One day he decided to run away
from home even though he doesn't

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:00.897
have a single clue about how
to take care of himself!

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:01.856
He left?

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:03.483
Yeah, it's been a while now.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:06.319
But I'm positive he'll
come back home eventually.

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:11.866
[SATOKO]
Hmm?

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:12.784
Keiichi?

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:14.035
I can hardly believe it,

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:16.705
but sometimes you
can be real mature.

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:20.375
No, I've always been this way,
thank you very much!

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:23.044
[KEIICHI] I bet you
miss your nii‐nii, huh?

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:25.630
Look. I didn't call
him anything like that.

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.799
He's just my
big brother, all right?

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:28.842
Except you did.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:29.718
Totally.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.594
No. That's not true.

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:35.015
I'd never call my nii‐nii
something like nii‐nii!

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:36.641
[KEIICHI]
Thanks for the chow.

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.101
[RIKA]
If it weren't for Satoko,

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:39.728
your tummy would've
kept you wide awake

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.730
going all "grumble grumble"!

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:43.690
[SATOKO]
You're lucky we stopped by.

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:44.566
Oh yeah.

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:47.235
Don't forget to brush
your teeth before you go to bed!

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.154
Thanks for the reminder.

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:51.740
Okay, enjoy the rest
of your evening!

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.661
[KEIICHI]
Hmm?

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.496
What, did you forget something?

00:08:58.538 --> 00:08:59.789
[RIKA]
Congratulations.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:01.833
You earned an A‐plus today!

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:04.127
You get a huge
round of applause!

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:04.919
Why?

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:07.380
I don't remember doing
anything worth praising.

00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:09.466
Tonight, you gave Satoko
the next best thing

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:11.509
to a homecoming
for her big brother,

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.971
and I bet that must've
made her really happy!

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:17.390
I can't fill the shoes
that Satoshi left behind,

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:19.976
but you've got a
fighting chance Keiichi.

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:23.313
[SATOKO]
Rika! Enough lollygagging.

00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:24.689
Let's go!

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:27.150
[RIKA]
All right. I'm off, then.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:29.194
[KEIICHI]
Mm. Yeah.

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:45.210
[SATOKO]
Here's a tip.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:48.963
Most stores have special sales
for a limited time.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:51.424
If you wait long
enough you can score pork

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:53.802
for your stir fry at half price!

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.220
[KEIICHI]
If we're looking to save,

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.305
why not get this
family pack instead?

00:09:57.347 --> 00:10:00.183
You're not feeding
a family, are you?

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:01.726
You gotta be kidding me.

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:04.979
Talk about a lack of
financial management skills.

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:06.147
No wonder you came crawling

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:08.358
on your hands
and knees for my help!

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.366
[KEIICHI] I sorta like
shopping for ingredients.

00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:18.535
Can't wait to get
started on dinner.

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.328
[SATOKO] It's just one
of the many wonderful steps

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.455
in the meal preparation process.

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:25.458
The best part will be sitting
down to eat the results, though!

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.751
[KEIICHI]
Yup!

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.212
Especially since you're the one

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:31.214
who's gonna be
making it, Satoko.

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:35.093
Huh. Oh. Well, obviously.

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:37.428
I'm glad you're
looking forward to it!

00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:48.565
[KEIICHI]
Looking good!

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:52.443
Now this is the type of
stir‐fry I was thinking of!

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.282
It's phenomenal!

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:01.327
Hold on.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.246
Did you remember
to wash your hands?

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:04.831
[KEIICHI]
Can't I do it once I'm done?

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:06.583
That isn't how it works!

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:09.919
You should always clean
thoroughly before dinner!

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:11.462
Fine.

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.093
Huh?

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:19.304
What?

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:21.556
[KEIICHI screams]

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:25.727
[SATOKO chortles]
Gotcha.

00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:28.646
I had a feeling
you'd fall for that one!

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:31.649
[KEIICHI]
Ugh. Why, you little...

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:34.485
Can't believe you
pulled one over on me.

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:40.700
What are you smiling for?

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:41.784
[KEIICHI]
Oh.

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:44.037
I don't have
any siblings, so, uh,

00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:47.665
to be honest, hanging out with
you like this is kind of nice.

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:50.251
Your mom and dad won't be around

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:52.420
to cook for you
anytime soon, correct?

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.422
So, if you need me to,
then I could‐‐

00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:57.884
[phone rings]

00:11:57.926 --> 00:11:58.718
[KEIICHI]
Mom.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.677
What's up?

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.429
[MOEKO] We finished
all our work here earlier

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:02.931
than we had planned.

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:06.309
So, we'll be back home with
you by tomorrow morning.

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.603
[KEIICHI]
Huh? Tomorrow?

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:10.230
Good to know.

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:17.403
Hey, I'm home.

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:18.571
[MOEKO]
Great timing.

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:20.531
Rena just called you!

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:21.741
[KEIICHI]
Hmm?

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.868
Is something up?

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.328
Do we have club today?

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.704
[RENA]
It's an emergency!

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.373
We need your help
winning a fight.

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:29.374
Please hurry!

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:30.500
[KEIICHI]
Seriously?

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:32.585
They've got Satoko
backed into a corner.

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.170
And now she's in trouble!

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:35.880
Oh no. Don't you worry.

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.465
I'll be right there!

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.937
I'm coming, Satoko!

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:59.279
Lemme at 'em, I'll beat them
all to a bloody pulp!

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.327
What the‐?

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:08.830
Over here, Keiichi.

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:10.415
It's gonna be okay, Satoko.

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.208
Someone's here to save the day!

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.043
Huh?

00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:17.547
[RENA]
Hurry up, get in there already!

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:33.146
Hey, um, Keiichi.

00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:36.983
Would you mind if I asked
you something? Can I?

00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:38.443
Can I?

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:40.320
Why did you make it sound
like there was a fight

00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:42.697
if what you meant was baseball?

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:49.704
Don't even need
to run the bases!

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:51.956
[laughs]

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:53.708
Hooray, we won!

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.628
Why did you even
bother calling me?

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:00.048
[KAMEDA]
Damn it all!

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:02.342
That's the ballgame.

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:04.385
Now, you remember
our deal, right?

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:06.679
Of course, how could I forget.

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:09.891
Like I promised, I'll throw us
a big victory barbecue tomorrow.

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:10.933
All right.

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:13.269
And you had better
buy us the fancy stuff.

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:15.730
Don't try to skimp out on us
with too many vegetables,

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:17.440
or you'll regret it!

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.193
There, there Irie.

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:20.985
It's okay.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.071
But I feel bad
for your poor wallet.

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:25.031
At least we won, huh?

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:35.625
[RENA] Aww!
This meat is out of this world!

00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:37.877
[SATOKO]
Exactly how it should be.

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:40.588
Ordinary cuts of third‐rate
beef would be a meager prize

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.216
for the absolute miracle
I pulled off yesterday!

00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:44.884
[MION]
You've got a point there.

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.804
That incredible
home run won us the game.

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:50.390
Wow, you're a
natural athlete, Satoko!

00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:51.474
Sure are.

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:52.308
And not only that,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.103
but clearly one of the
best of our generation!

00:14:55.144 --> 00:14:56.687
[laughs]

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:59.190
Cut it out,
you're going to make me blush!

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.859
[IRIE] Having fun?
Because they sure are.

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.361
[KEIICHI]
Hmm?

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:04.987
Watching that
little slugger laugh

00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:08.032
and play just lifts
your soul, doesn't it?

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:09.575
You are?

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:10.201
[IRIE]
Pardon me.

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:13.246
I'm Irie, but
everyone calls me Coach.

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:14.455
[KEIICHI]
Uh.

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:15.915
Nice to meet you.

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:18.876
It seems like you really care
about Satoko, huh, Coach?

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.462
[IRIE] Yes, that's correct.
She's the best.

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:23.256
And in the future,
when she's all grown up,

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:25.341
I'm sure she'll
be an excellent wife.

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:27.427
Wait, what?

00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:28.344
Oh my.

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:31.055
I hadn't considered
you might be a rival suitor.

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:35.059
Well, this is awkward.
[laughs]

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:38.729
[IRIE]
It's a shame, though.

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:41.524
Her brother Satoshi used
to play baseball with us too,

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.192
but he stopped showing up.

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:44.986
Ah...

00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:47.363
Sounds pretty rough.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:48.531
And now,

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:51.075
the Hinamizawa Fighters
just aren't the same.

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:54.454
It's been about a year now
since he left the village.

00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:56.956
Do you know why he left?

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:58.916
A lot of things happened.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.169
Awful things.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.421
It started right
around this time.

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:06.048
It was about three years back.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.967
Their parents were
in a terrible accident‐‐

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:09.594
the kind no one sees coming.

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:10.803
[KEIICHI]
Accident?

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:11.804
[IRIE]
Indeed.

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:12.889
While they were on vacation,

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.433
they fell from
an observation deck.

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.268
So sad.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.895
It's just her now.

00:16:18.936 --> 00:16:22.273
She lives with Miss Furude,
who also lost her parents,

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:26.360
and they support
each other as best they can.

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:27.904
With all that's happened,

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:30.907
I've given serious
thought to adopting her.

00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:32.241
[KEIICHI]
Huh?

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:34.827
[IRIE] But there're legal
matters to deal with.

00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:36.621
Issues that would
prevent me from helping

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:38.956
the poor girl find
a proper home.

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:41.125
It's an unfortunate situation.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:44.128
I suspect my silly dream
of hearing her call me papa

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.464
won't be happening anytime soon.

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:47.465
[sighs]

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:49.175
The only thing
I wish is for that smile

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:51.135
to never leave her face.

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:55.139
[KEIICHI]
Me too.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:57.642
I'm glad we can
agree on that, Maebara.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:59.810
Then indulge me for a moment.

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:03.231
Promise you'll never do
anything to make her cry.

00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:05.024
Uh.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:07.818
Yeah. You can count on me.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.071
Hypothetically speaking.

00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:12.865
If you did adopt her,
what would that be like?

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:16.369
[IRIE] Hmm... That's a
difficult question to answer.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.453
[SHION]
Let's see.

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:19.121
You'd get her
to call you "Master"

00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:21.457
and train her to be
your personal maid.

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:24.085
Hey. Where'd that
idea come from?

00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:24.710
Easy.

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:26.629
It's not like I was
the one who said that!

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:27.547
[SHION]
On top of that,

00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:31.551
you'd even have her wear
the maid uniform to go with it.

00:17:31.592 --> 00:17:34.011
Huh, the frilly ones with lace.

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:36.013
Honestly,
that would be adorable.

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:38.432
[SHION]
Hear that. You said it yourself!

00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:39.892
It's Shion!

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:42.436
Hi! Well, gotta run!

00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:45.481
[KEIICHI]
You! Hold it right there.

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:48.234
Why are you snooping around?

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:49.485
Believe it or not.

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:51.279
You're looking
at the team manager

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.406
of the Hinamizawa Fighters!

00:17:53.447 --> 00:17:54.699
I didn't know that.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.243
Wait, then why didn't
I see you at the game?

00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:59.120
That's because
I'm a ghost manager

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:01.163
who does her job
from the shadows.

00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:02.456
Tee hee!

00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:04.166
But I'm sure it would have
been an even better time

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:06.085
had you been there
on the bench with us.

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:08.671
We'd all love to see you
cheering us on at the next one!

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:10.840
Sure. I'll think about it.

00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:12.925
By the way, before I forget!

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:16.762
I heard that promise you made,
so you should count me in too!

00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:19.390
You talking about
the one I made for Satoko?

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:23.019
[SHION] Yep. After all,
I'm practically her big sister!

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.020
[KEIICHI]
Huh?

00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:26.522
[SHION]
It's me. Your nee‐nee Shion!

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:30.401
[SATOKO] Hey,
would you mind letting me go?

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:35.031
When I see moments like these,
I wish they could last forever.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:43.289
[KEIICHI]
Rika.

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:43.998
Mii?

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.750
You seen Satoko around?

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:49.003
I think she left early to go
and get groceries for dinner.

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:50.087
[KEIICHI]
Did she?

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:51.339
That's convenient.

00:18:52.673 --> 00:18:54.967
It must be nice
to ditch clean‐up duty!

00:18:55.009 --> 00:18:57.303
Satoko is really clever
and can think on her feet.

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:59.055
Unlike you, Keiichi.

00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:00.681
Ni‐pah!

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.438
[BOY E] The Watanagashi
festival's happening next week.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.648
[BOY B]
Yeah.

00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:10.858
Think Lord Oyashiro
will curse someone?

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:11.651
[gasps]

00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:14.028
He got Satoshi last time.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.405
I hope we'll be safe this year.

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:19.492
[RENA]
The rainy season was so short,

00:19:19.533 --> 00:19:21.452
it feels like
summer got here early!

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:22.495
[MION]
Good riddance.

00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:25.206
It would suck if it
rained during Watanagashi.

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:28.334
Hey. Is something the matter?

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:30.461
[KEIICHI]
Listen.

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:33.130
Can I ask you guys
about Satoko's brother?

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:37.259
[MION]
Uh. Y'mean. Like Satoshi.

00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:40.971
Uh. A year ago he...
he transferred!

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:44.934
He transferred? Or was it...

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:47.937
Did it have something to do
with Oyashiro's curse?

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.446
[MION]
Oh, that's right!

00:19:57.488 --> 00:19:59.782
I said I'd lend you
some manga, didn't I?

00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:01.742
Wanna come over?

00:20:01.784 --> 00:20:04.328
Wait, but you never mentioned‐‐

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:08.290
Oh. That's right.

00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:09.709
Yeah, I remember now.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.628
In that case,
I'm gonna head home.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.130
[MION]
See you tomorrow!

00:20:14.171 --> 00:20:16.173
[RENA]
Yup. See you later.

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:22.179
[MION] Tell me, when it
comes to Satoko's family,

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.140
how much do you know?

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:26.517
[KEIICHI] I know her mom
and dad died in an accident

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.228
and that her brother
ran away from home.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.730
[MION] I guess nobody
told you that her parents

00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:34.567
were on the other side when we
were protesting the dam project.

00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:35.776
[KEIICHI]
I thought that everyone here was

00:20:35.818 --> 00:20:38.779
supposedly against anything
like that happening.

00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:40.156
Not quite.

00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:43.117
The government couldn't start
building till we moved out.

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:45.369
They were planning to
pay bribes for us to leave,

00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:47.413
which some liked.

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:51.083
Satoko's folks led the
pro‐construction crowd.

00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:52.835
On the day of the festival,

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:55.504
her parents ended
up passing away.

00:20:55.546 --> 00:20:57.631
Which is the part
you heard about.

00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:00.760
Then, rumors spread
that they died

00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:03.888
because Lord Oyashiro
had cursed them.

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:06.807
They also said it's
why Satoshi disappeared.

00:21:08.392 --> 00:21:09.894
In any case,

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:12.772
between her trauma and those
stories about the curse,

00:21:12.813 --> 00:21:14.023
she doesn't need
to hear anything

00:21:14.064 --> 00:21:17.193
that'll remind her
about what happened.

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:20.237
It's a lot. So,
we avoid mentioning it.

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:23.073
For Satoko's sake.

00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:27.244
[MION] You understand where
we're coming from, right?

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:28.954
Uh‐huh.

00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:32.541
I'm sorry.

00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:35.711
I shoulda been a little
more tactful back there.

00:21:35.753 --> 00:21:38.631
Anyway, I'm just grateful
that Satoko gets to live

00:21:38.672 --> 00:21:41.467
a peaceful life
with Rika for now.

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:45.012
Yeah, me too. For now.

00:21:56.106 --> 00:21:57.900
What the hell
are you lookin' at?

00:21:57.942 --> 00:21:59.693
[GARDENER]
Uh. Nothing!

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:04.323
[TEPPEI]
C'mon, Satoko. Get inside.

00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:06.492
Okay. Uncle Teppei.

00:23:53.015 --> 00:23:56.769
[RIKA] Next time:
<i>Tataridamashi‐hen</i>, Part Two.
