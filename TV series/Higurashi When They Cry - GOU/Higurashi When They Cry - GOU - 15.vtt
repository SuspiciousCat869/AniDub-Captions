WEBVTT

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:12.304
[KEIICHI]
Huh?

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:14.097
That's completely ridiculous!

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.807
It makes perfect sense.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.392
You know we've all
noticed how intense

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:18.769
you can get when
you're playing games

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.437
with the club, right?

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:21.480
[SATOKO]
I agree.

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:24.024
Keiichi would be an
excellent candidate.

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:27.361
I only get so into games
because I don't wanna lose.

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:28.654
I'm not trying to
make it more exciting

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.739
for everyone else on purpose.

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:32.074
But if you're not trying to,

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.784
that just means you're so
good at making things fun

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.078
for people that you
can't help doing it!

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:39.039
Uh? Yeah, could be!

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:40.916
But I don't wanna
take credit for that.

00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.459
[chuckles]

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:44.253
[SATOKO] You think that he'd
be a good choice for it too,

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:45.462
don't you, Rika?

00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:46.797
Huh?

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:49.591
Yes, he'd be excellent!

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:52.094
Keiichi has a natural talent
for making any activity

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.888
he's a part of
more fun for everybody!

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.598
Ni‐pah!

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.600
Hold on. Think about it.

00:00:58.642 --> 00:00:59.768
We were talking about putting me

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.895
on the planning
committee for the festival.

00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:03.605
That's a totally
different thing!

00:01:03.647 --> 00:01:06.191
Don't get so hung up
on the title, okay?

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.360
Just let me tell
you about the work.

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:09.194
In short,

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.738
I want you as our host
for the festival auction!

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.906
Huh?!

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:15.367
Are you frickin' kidding me?!

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:53.090
In other words, the
festival committee will be

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:54.549
auctioning off donated prizes,

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:56.760
and you're asking me
to be the auctioneer?

00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:58.804
Yep! And if they're really
impressed with your work,

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.472
they're all gonna
pitch in and set you up

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:02.724
with free tickets to the
Angel Mort Dessert Fest

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:04.226
for the next three years.

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.604
Goodness, that sounds like
quite the extravagant reward.

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:09.940
But I'm sure Keiichi
is ready to earn it!

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:13.485
Huh. Easy enough to say someone
else can do something, huh?

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:14.444
[RENA giggles]

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:16.822
I'm sure you'll be fine!

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:22.369
[YOSHIRO]
Hmm...

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:23.912
Look, I'd love to
support you guys,

00:03:23.954 --> 00:03:26.623
but stock doesn't grow
on trees, you know?

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:29.459
With your generous donation,
my grandhag hopes we can offer

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.253
something exciting
on the auction block

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:33.338
for guests of every age!

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.800
A request from the demon queen
of the Sonozakis, huh?

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.178
[YOSHIRO]
Okay. I'll donate.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.764
Thank you so much,
Uncle Yoshiro!

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:44.808
All right, Kei,
we're good to go!

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.185
He's gonna donate
something to the auction!

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.479
Awesome job, Mion!

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:52.023
Now we gotta find something
that'll get attention,

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.901
and then the bids
will start pouring in!

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:58.113
[chortles]
Leave that to me!

00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:00.490
[chuckles] I'll watch
his face to make sure

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:02.367
we're not going overboard.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.286
[SATOKO]
Oh? Look, Rena!

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.204
Don't you think these
would be perfect?

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.957
[RENA]
Awoo! They're so kyute!

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.042
I wanna take all of 'em home!

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:15.213
Could you not? I was hoping
I could sell some. Heh‐heh.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.716
Whoa! Check it out!

00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:18.675
Mahjong.

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:21.136
Hah! I haven't
played in a while!

00:04:21.178 --> 00:04:24.264
Though I've probably forgotten
most of the rules to it by now.

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:25.849
Rena, you played?

00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:28.435
Did you guys do mahjong for
club or something like that?

00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:30.479
[SATOKO]
End of last year, if I recall.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.564
[RENA]
You were great at it, Satoko!

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:34.524
[SATOKO chortles]

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:35.901
Fish through my discard pile,

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:38.028
and you'll catch
a sound beating!

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.988
Hey, you better not
be playing mahjong

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.324
while you're on
the clock, Uncle Yoshiro.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:44.326
Never, I wouldn't dream of it.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.786
But this one customer told me

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:47.537
he could pull off
a <i>tsubame gaeshi</i>,

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.581
so I asked him to demonstrate.

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:52.209
No! A real <i>tsubame gaeshi</i>?!

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.794
Yep. The real thing.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:56.546
Okay, so what is
a <i>tsubame gaeshi</i>?

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:57.964
It's a cunning trick
where you secretly

00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:00.926
exchange your hand and
your wall in one quick move.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.803
Awoo! That sounds so cool!

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:04.596
Could you show me, Satoko?

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:06.932
I've practiced the
technique many times,

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.768
but I've made very few
successful attempts.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.561
Let me see!

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:14.648
I'll do my best, then.

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:15.649
Just don't laugh at me

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.693
if I can't manage
to make it work.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:21.863
Why would you spend that much
time practicing an illegal move?

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.240
Satoko's the type
who always likes

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:25.450
to place her
traps ahead of time.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:26.409
That way nobody knows

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:29.329
what's going on
until it's too late.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.623
[SATOKO]
Okay, here I go!

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:39.297
[SATAKO]
Now!

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:45.971
[chuckles]

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.431
[SATAKO] You can't say
I didn't warn you all.

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:50.225
[KEIICHI]
It looked pretty close, though!

00:05:50.267 --> 00:05:52.978
Actually, I think
I'll give it a shot.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.312
Me too!

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.023
Well now, what could
all this be about?

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.358
Hey, welcome.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.484
Ooishi.

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.695
Are you sure that it's
wise to be stopping in here

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.488
while you're on
the beat, Detective?

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.156
Wait. "Detective?"

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.616
[OOISHI laughs]

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:09.369
As it just so happens,
I'm not on duty today.

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.746
My old mahjong mat
started falling apart on me,

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.499
so I'm taking the
opportunity to replace it.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:17.252
You kids didn't strike me
as mahjong players.

00:06:17.294 --> 00:06:20.922
I'd figured it was too complex
for most youngsters to get into.

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:22.507
[laughs]

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:24.926
May be, but
"most youngsters" wouldn't

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:26.261
last a second in our game club.

00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:27.178
We were just getting ready

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.598
to start practicing
the <i>tsubame gaeshi</i>!

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.100
So you're back here
practicing cheating?

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:33.393
That's something else.

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:36.229
Also, incidentally, the
customer who showed it to me

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:37.689
was the old detective here.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.482
What? Seriously?

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:41.151
[OOISHI laughs]

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:43.069
I wouldn't attempt it
in a real game,

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:44.404
but it's a crowd‐pleaser.

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:46.197
Detective Ooishi, right?

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.073
Can we see?

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.742
Will you show us
how you did that?

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.411
[laughs]

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:53.997
Keep those eyes open!

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:54.831
Now.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.625
Here it comes.

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.096
[KEIICHI]
Whoa!

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:11.723
You did that like
it was nothing!

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.266
That was incredible!

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:14.851
I'm completely blown away!

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:17.145
Well, my name is
Keiichi Maebara, sir,

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:19.481
and I've gotta learn
how to do that too!

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.108
Well, if you're willing to
practice, I could teach you.

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.152
[RIKA]
Can it be?

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:27.781
Ooishi and Keiichi bonding
over a mahjong table?

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:29.658
So do I hold it like this?

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:30.951
The important thing to remember

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:34.162
is that you're not trying
to pick up the tiles.

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:35.830
‐‐[AKASAKA] There you are!
‐‐[OOISHI] Huh?

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:39.834
Seems like you had some trouble
finding the place, Akasaka!

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:45.131
Quite a bit, actually.
I got completely turned around.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.271
Akasaka. Is that you?

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:03.817
So, I guess that means
you must be little Rika.

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:05.402
[MION]
Huh? You've met?

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:06.403
[OOISHI]
News to me.

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:08.989
No idea you knew
Ms. Furude here.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.115
Who would've guessed?

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.449
It's been a good while,

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:14.119
and you've grown up so
much since I last saw you.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.370
You've grown some, too.

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:17.580
You look stronger
than you were before.

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:19.624
Why are you back in Hinamizawa?

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.293
I just came out here
with my wife on vacation.

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:25.213
So, we left our daughter
with my parents for a while.

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:27.632
[OOISHI]
Akasaka's wife is quite the gem,

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:30.260
so it's only natural that
he's very attached to her.

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:31.761
Like, five years ago,

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.180
we were in the middle of
a work trip to Okinomiya

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.433
when all of a sudden he got
so worried about his wife

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.393
that he went AWOL
halfway through the day

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:39.602
to check up on her.

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.521
That was a fun one to explain.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.690
That was the day you
told me something awful

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:46.735
was going to happen to Yukie
if I wasn't by her side,

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.862
and it spooked me so bad
I went straight back to her

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:50.196
at the hospital.

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:52.407
Then, later that same day,

00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:54.659
somebody had a bad fall
on the staircase

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.828
Yukie normally
used to get around.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.997
If I hadn't listened
to your warning,

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.040
it could have been my wife

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.709
who got hurt on
those stairs that day.

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:03.918
[SATOKO]
I can believe that.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.880
Rika's always had an odd habit
of saying prophetic things.

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:10.383
Well, people do say she's
Lord Oyashiro reborn.

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:13.136
As far as I'm concerned,
you saved her life.

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:15.805
I owe you so much.

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:17.307
I'll do whatever you need.

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:25.565
In June 1983, on the 19th,

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:29.611
or some day shortly after,
somebody is going to kill me.

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:30.695
How do you‐‐?

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.781
[RIKA]
I want to live a happy life.

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:34.574
That's all I want.

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:37.202
A full life surrounded
by the friends I love.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.913
A chance to enjoy their
company without fear.

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:43.333
If I can just have that,
it'll be enough.

00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:45.877
There must be a way.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.670
I don't wanna die.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:49.714
[AKASAKA]
It's been five years.

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:52.467
I'm stronger and I have
more experience now.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.928
This time I really can help.

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:03.019
I need to talk
to you in private.

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:09.692
Akasaka, how long do you
plan on staying here?

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:12.654
Well, we were going to be
in town through the festival.

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:13.822
[chuckles]

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:15.949
It's a pretty long vacation.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.202
The precinct was on my back
about all the unused PTO.

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:22.747
Does that mean that you're
going to be here in Hinamizawa

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:25.625
and you won't be leaving
until Watanagashi is over?

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.460
Uh, well, no,

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:29.671
I was heading to
meet up with my wife.

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:32.132
We're going to be staying
at Wakura Onsen.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:33.967
It's a trek, but not too far.

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:35.635
Akasaka?

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:38.596
[RIKA]
Do you think you could stay?

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.724
Here in the village,
until Watanagashi is over.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:42.892
I'm sorry?

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:45.520
I understand how much
I'm asking of you.

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:46.813
But I...

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:48.898
I really need your help.

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:52.902
Of course,

00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:54.529
then I'll let Yukie
know that she should

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:57.615
head to the hot springs
resort without me.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:58.700
Are you sure?

00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:00.952
Heh. If it hadn't been for you,

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.163
my wife might not be
with us anymore.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.206
If I couldn't return
that favor to you,

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:07.333
I don't think I could
ever forgive myself.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:10.628
Akasaka. Thank you so much!

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.089
Honestly, I owe you
a lot more than this,

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:15.675
and I'm sure Yukie
won't hold it against you.

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:19.095
I'm guessing she'll hold it
against me a little bit, though.

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:21.556
Well, that might be
the real danger!

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:29.898
[AKASAKA laughs]

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:32.775
I know where you are now,
you disgusting parasites!

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:37.322
[laughs]

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:38.656
I can feel you.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.575
You've been in me
the whole time!

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:42.076
Get out of my body!

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:44.829
Get out. Get out!
Get out! [screams]

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:46.497
[OOISHI]
Akasaka, can you hear me?

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.917
We're willing to hear
whatever demands you have.

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.251
Our only priority right now

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:53.504
is to ensure Rika Furude
is alive and well!

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:54.797
Please, Akasaka.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.674
Tell me what it is you want!

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:57.967
Shut the hell up!

00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:59.469
I've almost done it.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.346
I finally tracked
down their nest!

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.264
These bugs have been
burrowing into my brain,

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:05.934
but not anymore!

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:10.772
Okay. We're almost done.

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:12.440
Rika.

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:15.985
I'm doing all this for you.

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.571
[laughs]

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:21.616
See? It'll be okay now!

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:23.493
The parasites
were inside of you too,

00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:25.286
but now I got 'em all out!

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:27.914
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, Rika!

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:29.916
[laughs]

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.292
Of course not.

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:35.213
[AKASAKA]
Dammit, this itching is torture!

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:38.091
I know how to get rid
of these damn bugs!

00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:39.550
[pants]

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.844
[screams]

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.264
Itchy, itchy, itchy,
itchy, itchy!

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:45.682
How do you like this?

00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:48.685
You think you can hide from
a fire, you little fuckers?

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:53.856
[laughs]

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.859
Answer me if you recognize
my voice, Akasaka!

00:12:56.901 --> 00:13:01.030
It's your mahjong buddy Oishi,
we worked a case together!

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:02.448
Trust me, I'm on your side!

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.449
Hang in there!

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:04.993
[MION]
Why is this happening?

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:07.078
I'm going in!

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.454
[OOISHI]
Stay back, Maebara!

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.081
[KEIICHI]
Let go of me!

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.749
Rika is trapped in there!

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:13.751
I have to go and help my friend!

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:15.670
I know why you
wanna do this, son,

00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:18.172
but you need to let the
professionals handle this!

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:19.799
[SATOKO]
We're here, Rika!

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:23.636
Please shout if you're okay!
I swear we'll‐‐

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.722
Rika, no!

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.143
Oh, please.

00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:32.103
Someone call the
fire department!

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.604
Hurry!

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.983
Itchy, itchy, itchy, itchy!

00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:38.609
Damn it!

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:42.196
Just let me live long enough
to feel the little bastards die!

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:43.323
[laughs]

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:47.952
It's always a surprise how badly
those tragic dice can land.

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:49.203
Really.

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:52.123
Akasaka, of all people, right?

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:57.879
[laughs]

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.235
[YAKUZA]
Don't. Please!

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.655
It's my hand wielding the blade,

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:27.784
but it was Hinamizawa Village
that killed you.

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:32.872
[AKANE] This itching in
my neck is unbearable.

00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:34.582
[MION]
Mom.

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:36.292
Are you still alive?

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:40.213
I'm glad you spoke up
before I moved on.

00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.923
But why?

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:46.427
[AKANE] Our hateful
lineage must end here.

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:48.679
The demon blood inside us.

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:51.849
I'll spill every last,
foul drop!

00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:58.981
[AKANE]
This is intolerable.

00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:01.818
Like bugs digging into my flesh!

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:03.069
[moans]

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:05.905
I can't stop itching.

00:15:06.697 --> 00:15:08.241
And I'm sure your tainted blood

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:11.202
must be torturing you
just as much, dear.

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.956
Even worse,

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:16.749
Ssince you cut up
my shoulders so badly,

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:19.544
I can't even lift my arms
to scratch my throat.

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.671
You genuinely didn't
deserve to be born

00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:24.132
into such a cursed
family as the Furudes.

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.678
If only we all could
choose our own fates,

00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:30.012
I would never
have had to be born

00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:32.056
in this hellmouth of a village!

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:35.309
If only, but the curse of
Hinamizawa was upon us

00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:36.978
from our very first breaths,

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:39.063
and a hideous death
is our birthright.

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:43.609
[AKANE] Indeed, all the
misery and pain and itching.

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:45.778
You deserve better.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.406
I'm going to stop
the hurting now!

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:50.783
Yes, you'd be
doing me a kindness.

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:52.660
Please put an end to this.

00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:54.871
I'm ready to move on
to the next world.

00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:58.416
And once your Hinamizawa
blood is purged.

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.668
I'll join you in that world.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.044
Now go!

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:17.310
[KIMIYOSHI]
If this keeps up,

00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:19.729
the curse'll wipe out
the whole village.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.939
Someone's gotta take care of it,

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:25.318
and it looks like it's
gonna have to be me!

00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:27.153
Don't do this.

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:30.072
Please let me go.

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.118
I surely do wish I could, Rika.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.245
Trust me, if I thought
there was some better way,

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:37.872
I would never do this.

00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:42.919
Truth is, there aren't many
untainted souls around,

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.879
so at the end of the day
it's gonna have to be you

00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:46.464
that drowns in the swamp.

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:49.050
Kimiyoshi, if you
plan on killing me,

00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:51.052
then can't you just do it here?

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:52.011
Well, if I do that,

00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:54.680
Lord Oyashiro's not gonna
be happy with me at all,

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:55.932
is he now?

00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:57.808
[RIKA]
You can sacrifice me.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.185
Just hurry up and kill me

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:03.272
and do whatever you need to do
with my body after that. Please.

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:04.815
Bless your little heart.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.234
[RIKA]
Get it over with.

00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:08.528
I'm begging you.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.446
You can't offer up
a life to the gods

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:13.115
if all you bring to
the altar is a dead body.

00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:14.700
[RIKA]
Kimiyoshi!

00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:16.994
[grunts]

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:23.960
Boy, but there's some
thick‐headed folk here

00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:24.794
in the village.

00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:27.838
Why the hell won't
they understand?

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.675
It's the swamp gas that's
the real demon, I tell ya!

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:31.968
And we gotta do
somethin' about it

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:34.971
or it's gonna swallow
Hinamizawa whole!

00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:37.139
But I keep sayin' it and
they keep doin' nothing,

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:39.642
so in the end I gotta be
the one to get my hands dirty

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:42.270
and keep all those idiots alive!

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:44.689
[pants]

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.066
I know the whole story,
so please stop.

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:49.652
Those damn Sonozakis went soft.

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:51.862
Left the mess for
the Kimiyoshis to fix!

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:53.948
Who put them in charge, huh?

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.866
Buncha feckless cowards
that can't even do

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:57.743
what needs doin'
for the village!

00:17:57.785 --> 00:17:58.744
[yells]

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:02.832
[pants]

00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:05.960
Well, the blood of a Furude
woman has always been

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:08.546
just the thing when Lord
Oyashiro gets cranky,

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.798
and lucky us,
I happened to know exactly

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.592
where I could rustle one up!

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:14.468
Stop talking.

00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:17.138
Yes, yes.

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:18.347
Getting the chance to carry on

00:18:18.389 --> 00:18:20.016
your ancestors'
tradition like this,

00:18:20.057 --> 00:18:22.310
you must feel so proud.

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:24.353
[RIKA]
Please stop talking.

00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:27.857
If you ask me, we're the
only real family heads.

00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:30.109
Oryo's half senile by now.

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:32.403
and that Mion is
just about useless.

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:35.531
Everyone's forgotten what
they all owe to this village!

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:37.617
Kids these days, I swear.

00:18:37.658 --> 00:18:40.911
[RIKA] I get it, so please,
drop me overboard already

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.872
and let me carry out my role.

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:44.290
Ohh!

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:46.083
You're the only one
out of the other houses

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.710
who understands how important‐‐

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:51.088
I'd just rather drown than
choke on your rancid breath.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.633
Don't you talk back
to your elders!

00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:56.677
Hear me? You rotten little girl!

00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:26.874
[breaking glass]

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:35.466
[breaking glass]

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:37.551
[laughs]

00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:40.304
It's really getting
fun now, isn't it, Rena?

00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:42.264
Why would you do this, Keiichi?

00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:44.558
We were all just
hanging out with our friends!

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.018
[KEIICHI laughs]

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.230
And we're all having a great
time together, aren't we?

00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:51.565
But hey, it's gonna
get even better

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:55.528
once I bust that head
of yours wide open!

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:01.367
It's happening again.

00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:02.952
[laughs]

00:20:02.993 --> 00:20:06.455
Kinda like being in club,
isn't it? Hyaa!

00:20:06.497 --> 00:20:07.957
You're not wrong. But...

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:12.128
This isn't the kind of
world anyone wanted!

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.841
It's just a bad dream, Keiichi!

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:18.592
This isn't really you.

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:19.927
So please wake‐‐

00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:25.433
It's always someone different,

00:20:25.474 --> 00:20:28.477
and there's no way to
know where or when it'll be.

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:30.896
But it will happen.

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:34.692
And it's not fair.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:37.278
Why do I have to
go through this alone?

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:40.322
Watching my friends
die again and again.

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:45.077
[RIKA]
What horrible sin did I commit?

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:46.746
What was my crime?

00:20:46.787 --> 00:20:50.624
What have I done to
deserve eternity in this hell?

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:52.460
[KEIICHI]
It's just us now, Rika.

00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:55.254
Hurry up and tell me
how I get rid of them.

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:57.256
These parasites inside my body.

00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:58.716
How do I kill them all?

00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:00.926
I know you know more about them
than you're letting on,

00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:04.263
so tell me how to get rid of
these filthy maggots already!

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:09.393
[laughs]

00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:13.731
I do know what you need,
and it's right in front of you.

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:15.983
[KEIICHI] Don't make it
a game; just tell me!

00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:17.401
Right now, dammit!

00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:19.320
I can feel the things
crawling down my throat,

00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:20.780
I'm almost choking on 'em!

00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:24.116
And this itching is going
to drive me insane!

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.080
It's in here.

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:30.915
Huh?!

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:33.083
What you're looking
for is in my head.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:35.002
All you have to do
is crack open my skull

00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:37.755
and eat my brains,
and the itching will stop.

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:41.550
[laughs]

00:21:41.592 --> 00:21:43.010
I found it!

00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:46.430
I finally found the cure!

00:21:46.472 --> 00:21:49.934
[RIKA] I wish it was just a bad
dream and I could wake up.

00:21:56.607 --> 00:21:58.984
[RIKA]
I would open my eyes.

00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:00.569
See the sun shining
through the window

00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:03.989
of my dorm room at
Saint Lucia Academy.

00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:05.157
And I would get out of bed

00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:10.454
and go face a new day
where anything could happen.

00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:13.165
That's all I want.

00:22:13.207 --> 00:22:14.959
That would be enough for me.

00:23:50.054 --> 00:23:53.223
[RIKA] Next time:
<i>Nekodamashi‐hen</i>, Part Three.
