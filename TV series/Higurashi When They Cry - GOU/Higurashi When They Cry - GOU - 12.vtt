WEBVTT

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.931
[VILLAGER A] Who would
do something like this?

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:17.017
[VILLAGER B] Teppei would,
and did, from what I hear.

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:20.270
Relieved himself on
the torii gate walking out.

00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:22.689
[VILLAGER A]
The man's got no decency!

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:24.566
You know what
people've been saying.

00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:26.944
Lord Oyashiro
never stops watching.

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.529
Yeah.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.948
And he's looking
straight at the Hojos.

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.254
[TOMITAKE]
Keiichi!

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:47.339
Quite a crowd
you've gathered here.

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:49.508
[KEIICHI]
Tomitake and Takano!

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.009
Well, hi there.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.512
I admit I didn't
expect this turnout.

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.013
I'm impressed.

00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:58.016
How did you two know about this?

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:02.354
Maebara here filled us in on
the entire situation last night.

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.818
Sorry for the wait.

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:14.283
Coach, I've never been a
big fan of your sense of style.

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:16.326
but I must say,
you've really come through.

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:17.703
This kinda stuff
will help everyone

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.622
have a sense of solidarity,
like a uniform.

00:01:20.664 --> 00:01:22.791
Feels like we're in
the dam war again, huh.

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:25.544
Here, you too, Rika.

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:27.004
Thank you, miss.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:29.047
Right now,
Satoko needs our help,

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.758
and I'll do whatever
I can to get it to her.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.010
Thank you, Coach.

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:34.845
Shall we move out then?

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:37.639
What do you need today?

00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:39.141
You already know.

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.977
We came here to talk
about Satoko Hojo's case.

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:43.353
We demand action!

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:44.771
I'm very sorry to inform you

00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:47.316
that all of our meeting rooms
are booked for the day.

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:48.233
What?

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:49.776
The center director
is more than willing

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:51.278
to hear your concerns,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.488
but we don't have
enough room for you.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.741
We can only
accommodate three of you.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.409
Then make some room for us, now!

00:01:57.451 --> 00:02:00.162
We can do that.
It'll be fine.

00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:09.338
So, any good news?

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.299
It felt exactly like
a do‐over of yesterday.

00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:15.385
So they're just gonna keep
monitoring the situation?

00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:17.679
That's right.
They set a timeline.

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.640
They'll make their
decision in a month.

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:20.974
A whole month?

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:22.934
How much damage
are these pencil‐pushers

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.603
willing to let her uncle do?

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:28.190
For what it's worth, it seems
they're taking us seriously.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:31.151
[MION] We told everyone
we'd be back at it tomorrow,

00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:33.987
but I don't know
if they'll all be here.

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:36.114
This is so frustrating.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.909
If they don't come back, I will.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.869
Even if I'm by myself!

00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:42.329
I'm still in this.

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:44.790
If we're going
to hope for a miracle,

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.084
we have to make one together.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.251
Exactly.

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:51.922
Looks like we're
running out of daylight.

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:52.881
I'd say it's about time

00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:55.634
we let everybody head
home for the evening.

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:58.220
And there's a
festival planning meeting.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.055
I gotta go to that too!

00:03:00.097 --> 00:03:01.223
[KEIICHI]
You do?

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:02.349
Oh, right.

00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:04.601
I think you should come, Kei.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.235
[KEIICHI] Is it really okay
for me to be here?

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:15.278
[MION] You've got a
pretty good reputation.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.238
People have
actually been wanting

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.823
to meet you for a while.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.909
[RENA] I hope I won't be
in anybody's way, I hope.

00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.077
You won't be.

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:24.913
They'll be happy to see all
us youngsters taking part.

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:27.124
They should be, at least!

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:28.291
Hi everyone!

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.669
You've all arrived early.

00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:32.504
[VOLUNTEER A]
Hey, Mion's here!

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:34.631
And she brought some muscle!

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:35.716
[VOLUNTEER B]
Hell, I don't see 'em

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:37.467
gettin' in the way of anything!

00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:42.264
[KIMIYOSHI]
That explains it!

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:43.682
I knew some of those shoes

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:45.934
were too trendy
for these old farts.

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:47.644
What brings you kids here?

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:49.020
Mayor Kimiyoshi!

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.647
It's been too long.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.149
We were already with our friends

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.025
and thought
we should bring them.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:57.404
Lovely, that's wonderful.

00:03:57.446 --> 00:04:00.323
Hi. I'm Keiichi Maebara.

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:01.158
[KIMIYOSHI]
Yes.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.243
Thank you for joining us.

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:04.619
And you, Shion.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:06.246
You should come to the festival!

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:07.956
We would love to see you there.

00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:09.332
Gladly, sir.

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:12.294
I look forward to it,
but in the meanwhile,

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.713
we have something
to discuss, Mion.

00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:15.547
[MION]
What?

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.966
Please join me out
here for a moment.

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:22.429
Is something the matter?

00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:24.222
You're quite a pro at this.

00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:29.686
Hey, Kei.
Can I borrow you for a sec?

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:35.692
[KEIICHI]
Ms. Chie?

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.986
There's something
we needed to talk about.

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:39.112
[KEIICHI]
And it doesn't sound like

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:40.906
it's gonna be anything good.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:41.948
[CHIE]
You're all going back

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.701
to the Child Welfare office
tomorrow, aren't you?

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:45.744
[KEIICHI]
Of course.

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:48.663
All day, right?

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.374
After that, could you please
hold off on protesting

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:54.044
and give them time to decide?

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.921
This feels like a warning.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:58.215
It has something to do

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.258
with whatever
the mayor told you.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.636
Now you're passing
the message on to me.

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:03.637
Honestly.

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.347
I admire everything
you've been doing,

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:07.224
and I want you to succeed.

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:08.600
I do.

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:10.018
That's the truth.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.230
Ms. Chie's doing all she can
to help us keep Satoko safe,

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:15.315
but there's just an issue.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:16.608
I guess there
must be pressure on her

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.777
from somewhere higher up.

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.320
It's about our school.

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:23.406
For a long time it was
never officially recognized,

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:24.991
but Ms. Chie put
her career at risk

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:27.911
to come to Hinamizawa
and teach us.

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:29.913
I'd happily do it again.

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:32.624
My students are what matters.

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:36.086
But now, if we carry on,
they're all at risk,

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.004
and I can't allow that.

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:40.257
Mion is a good friend
whose leadership I trust,

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.884
and you're a teacher
I respect greatly.

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:46.721
I can't ignore a message from
the two strongest people I know.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:50.851
Something is up, and if the
pressure is getting to you guys,

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.853
it must be something big.

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:54.729
I can't guess what that's like.

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.565
[CHIE]
Maebara.

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:57.732
Please, tell me.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.526
Why won't the
older villagers let go

00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:01.194
of their feud with the Hojos?

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:03.363
The dam war has
been over for years,

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:06.157
and Satoko had nothing
to do with it anyway!

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.368
So why would they
punish her like this?

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.413
Who's doing it? Just tell me!

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:14.416
I wanna give 'em
a piece of my mind!

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:18.336
[MION] I don't think
there really is anyone.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.797
Nobody wants to see her suffer.

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.507
How do you know?

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:23.925
When the dam war was happening,

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:26.720
the Hojo family
was on the other side.

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:30.473
Or that's how everyone saw it.

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:33.727
But whatever anger we felt
died with Satoko's parents.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:36.271
They were the ones who
supported the dam, not her.

00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:38.940
[SHION] The problem is that
nobody's ever come forward

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:41.568
and said it out loud.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.071
As things are,
no one wants to be the first.

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:46.865
So the grudge lives on.

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:49.951
Nobody wants it, but everyone
thinks someone else does.

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:51.786
But that doesn't make any sense.

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:53.830
All of the kids at school
are from the village,

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.832
and we love Satoko!

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:58.668
The problem is mostly the
older people in the village,

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:59.920
but they're also the ones

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.297
who have the most
influence around here.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.007
And what's worse,
they think it's what

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:06.801
the demon hag of the
Sonozaki family wants,

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.595
but that's not true.

00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:09.888
She's like them.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.057
She's afraid to
call off the vendetta.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.058
Grandma would let it go

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.644
if she didn't think they
expected her to keep it up.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:18.021
So what do I have
to do to fix this?

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:20.023
Tell me who to
punch in the face!

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:21.524
I'm ready!

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:24.903
I just told you,
nobody wants to hurt Satoko!

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:28.114
No one in Hinamizawa has
a grudge against the Hojos!

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:31.076
No one!
They just can't say it!

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:39.042
It's a terribly sad story,
but honestly,

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:42.253
it's such a ridiculous one, too.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.464
They're all ready
to forgive Satoko,

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.049
but none of them
are ready to be the one

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:47.509
who speaks up first.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.638
Right, and that mindset
just festers in the village,

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.515
like mold in tatami.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:57.018
Once it's set in, all you can do
is rip it up and replace it.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.813
So the village elders
are afraid to get involved,

00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:00.855
'cause if they do,

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.983
they all think they
could become targets

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:06.069
for an unnamed mystery person
or group of people.

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:09.114
I'm not sure,
but this mystery person.

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:12.993
I suspect they go by
"Lord Oyashiro."

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.661
Great! You said it yourself,

00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:16.246
once the mold has set in,
we gotta rip up

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:19.624
all the flooring and put
in something new in its place!

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.376
We happen to be in luck, then,

00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:22.585
because there's a great big room

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:25.255
full of rotting
tatami right in front of us.

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:26.339
[CHIE]
Now wait a minute!

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:27.549
[MION]
Both of you!

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.675
[KEIICHI]
Yeah, sounds good!

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:31.720
I say we toss these crusty
old bastards to the curb!

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:32.595
Right!

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:35.223
They're gonna find out
that I'm stronger than I look!

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.057
[laughs]

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:39.060
Well, I'm glad we're
on the same team.

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:41.146
Now let's go!

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:43.064
Okay. I've got your back.

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:44.774
I'm ready to join too.

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:45.692
All right!

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:47.569
No stoppin' us now!

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.197
I understand your
situation, Ms. Chie.

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:55.577
But for right now,
please let us do this.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:59.080
All right, then.

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:01.708
I'm leaving things up
to all of you!

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.003
If Keiichi is on our side,
we'll be able to overcome fate.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.839
I know it's true,
deep down in my heart!

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.386
[KEIICHI]
Now, let's move out!

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.145
I have something to say.

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:23.688
[KIMIYOSHI]
We'd love to hear it, Keiichi,

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.191
but we handle
personal concerns last.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.318
I'm sorry, but I have to insist.

00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:31.112
We need to address this now.

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:33.698
This is about Satoko Hojo.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.408
She's in real danger.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.494
You're not tellin'
us anything new.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:40.538
We're all glad you got the gears
turnin' down at Child Welfare,

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.500
but now you gotta let
the system do its thing!

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:45.251
Are we causing some problem?

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:47.170
[VOLUNTEER D] Of course
it's causin' a problem!

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:48.755
Fine, then can you
explain it in a way

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:51.132
that someone my age
could understand?

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:53.384
Look, kid,
the dam war is all over

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.886
and done with, all right?

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:56.554
We've had our fill of
standing out in front

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.807
of government
buildings holding signs.

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:01.184
What does the stupid dam war
have to do with anything?

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.728
I don't care about
your good old days!

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.190
'Cause now,
I've got a war of my own!

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:09.400
Is that how you
speak to your elders?

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:12.237
The hell's wrong
with kids these days?

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:15.198
Right. Seems you're
jumping into the ring,

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.075
so let's see what you got.

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.868
Pardon me, gentlemen.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.079
Could I ask something, please?

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.455
How does the dam war being over

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:24.040
mean it's a problem
for us to continue

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:26.960
protesting at the
Child Welfare office?

00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:28.503
[VOLUNTEER F]
The thing is, our relationship

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.421
with the government
changed after that.

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:33.007
The war's over, and the
peace has been good to us.

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:34.509
We wanna keep it going.

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:35.760
[RENA]
That makes sense.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.428
I understand how
a good relationship

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.389
with the government
helps us all.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.306
[MION]
Oh yeah.

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:41.349
Why would we fight 'em

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:43.685
when we could
nestle up in their lap?

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:46.479
The village council's
gotten quite cozy with them.

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:48.106
They got the local
government to set aside

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:50.650
a generous slice of
the budget for Hinamizawa,

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:53.153
with some perks on top,
didn't you, now?

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:55.071
Shion, that's not fair.

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:57.031
Hold on. What's that mean?

00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:58.074
[RENA]
Mm‐hmm.

00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.701
Our council's been
bought and paid for,

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:01.369
and they don't
want some rowdy kids

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.996
messing up their arrangement.

00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:04.831
What the hell
do you know about it?

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:06.916
We're not here for a civics
lecture from a damn child!

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.544
Order. Settle down!

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:11.296
I see. So our village councilmen

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.298
are really just
government lapdogs?

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:15.383
[VOLUNTEER D] Young man,
you are way outta line!

00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:18.136
All you old men need
to get out of our way!

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:20.805
If you serve the village,
you owe it to us to help Satoko,

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.766
but you all abandoned her
because of her family name!

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:26.644
It's not about Satoko
or the Hojo name.

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.813
We are speaking
on behalf of the village.

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:30.356
You push these protests too far

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:32.942
and all of us
will suffer for it!

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:34.444
Look at this, Keiichi!

00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:37.071
It's so cool they framed it
and hung it on the wall!

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:39.657
"Our village attempted
to negotiate peacefully,

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.743
but the government refused
to engage with us."

00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:44.204
"Instead of respect,
they showed us indifference,

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:45.496
then violence.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.248
Rather than bring us
to the table,

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.459
they ground
us under their heels."

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.335
Is that right?

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:52.378
Doesn't that sound like
what the village council

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.255
is doing to us right now?

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:55.882
I don't know if this
is an appropriate place

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.842
for that scroll to be anymore.

00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:58.676
[chuckles]

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.303
Yup, you're not wrong.

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:01.471
Mii.

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:03.097
But Kimiyoshi wrote it himself,

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:06.809
to commemorate Hinamizawa's
victory in the dam war.

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:09.729
Since I first moved
to the village,

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.731
my friends have never
stopped telling me stories

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:14.567
about how hard you all
fought to save it back then.

00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:17.153
You survived through
the spirit of solidarity.

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:18.238
And trust me.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.240
I have nothing but
respect for the villagers

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:23.034
who helped foster that
spirit, and always will.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.495
But the Onigafuchi Defensive
Alliance are the ones

00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:27.997
I revere most!

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:30.458
They fought tooth and nail
against the government's tricks!

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.543
They're the reason we
have our spirit of unity,

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.921
and this beautiful
valley to live in!

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:38.883
I wanna be proud of the fact
that I live here in Hinamizawa!

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:41.094
Kid's got a point.

00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:42.679
Can't deny it.

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:45.223
[KEIICHI]
One enemy faces two of us.

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:46.891
We meet two of them with four.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:49.602
We meet four with eight
and eight with 16.

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:52.105
And if a thousand‐man
army comes for us,

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:55.358
everybody in the village
has to strike back as one!

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.237
When one of ours is in trouble,
we all come together and help!

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.906
That is what unifies
the Onigafuchi Guardians!

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:04.659
And Satoko Hojo is one of ours!

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:08.246
So now, in the spirit of
the old Onigafuchi Alliance.

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:11.082
We have to come
together once more!

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:20.842
Dammit, Keiichi's right.

00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:22.051
How's it our job to stand up

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:24.178
for the government's
mistakes, anyway?

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.140
It's not, but they make
our real job a lot easier.

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:30.184
Mister Mayor.

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.520
Even if we can't give 'em
our official support,

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:34.814
I don't think any of us has
the right to try and stop

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:36.649
what this young man is doing.

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:44.574
I say Maebara is exactly right.

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:45.533
[VOLUNTEER H]
Same here!

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:46.534
He's a mouthy little punk,

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.828
but he's speaking
straight from the heart.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.038
Yeah, I agree!

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.414
Keep it up, Keiichi.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.166
We won't stop ya!

00:13:53.207 --> 00:13:55.626
Right. We're all with you.

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.086
Even so.

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:59.464
Assuming the village shows up
in full force tomorrow,

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:00.673
we still have no guarantee

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:02.467
they'll be willing
to hear us out again.

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:03.426
Likely because they think

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:06.220
they have the village
council on their side.

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:08.389
That's why we need a public
statement of support

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:11.059
from the council for
Keiichi and his cause.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.643
Let's do it, Mister Mayor!

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:14.437
We know which side we're on!

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:16.606
I hear all of
you loud and clear,

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:17.982
and as a man, Keiichi,

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:20.860
I want you to know that I
respect everything you've done.

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:22.945
But my first duty
is to the village.

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:25.198
Let's be honest
about what this is.

00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:26.783
You're scared there
are people in the village

00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:28.826
who won't help
anyone named Hojo.

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:30.536
Isn't that the real problem?

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:31.454
It's true.

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:33.373
Nobody wants to
speak up for Satoko,

00:14:33.414 --> 00:14:35.458
because they think someone
else will push back!

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.921
On that subject, this
"someone else" is imaginary.

00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:41.839
No, they're real.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.633
I know them well.

00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:44.926
Then who?

00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:46.886
What is their name?

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:52.141
[RIKA]
Kimiyoshi.

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:55.770
Would you be willing to act
with that someone's permission?

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:57.647
Ya called me right out!

00:14:57.688 --> 00:14:59.190
Never woulda thought
you'd aim straight

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.858
for the throat like that, Rika.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.235
Wait, Grandma?

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:03.903
That hag?

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:05.488
Speaking for the Kimiyoshis,

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.825
our differences with the
Hojo family are all settled.

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:10.493
What say the Furudes?

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:11.577
Mii.

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:14.122
Mister Mayor, we'll handle this.

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:15.832
If you'll support us,

00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:17.417
we can talk to Mion's grandma

00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:20.837
and convince the Sonozaki family
to support us in our plan!

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:22.380
Then I'm behind you.

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:23.589
If Oryo will allow it,

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:26.134
the council can offer
its full support.

00:15:26.175 --> 00:15:28.928
As a man, you already have mine.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:29.971
[OOISHI chuckles]

00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:33.808
I gotta say, that's quite
impressive, Mister Maebara.

00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:40.231
[AKANE] The Child Welfare
folks know their jobs.

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:43.609
They don't let random members of
the public set their schedule.

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:46.612
So what issue are you expecting
the council to resolve?

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:48.197
It could take
them months to act.

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:50.658
Satoko will be in
danger every second!

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.201
We don't have time!

00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:55.663
Ain't like that brat's
gonna die between now and then.

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:59.041
You're here screamin' in my ear
over a few bumps and bruises?

00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:01.210
Well...
He might not kill her, but...

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:03.129
Then why should
I give a rat's ass?

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:04.922
You fools took your
lives in your hands,

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:08.468
makin' me spend a second
of the time I got on you.

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:11.179
There ain't a pair
of balls between ya!

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:13.764
Oryo.

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:16.434
Satoko is one of
my most precious friends.

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:18.853
I'm only asking you
to help her out.

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:21.063
I've told you
many times, Rika dear,

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:23.191
it's important
to pick your friends.

00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:24.484
And you shoulda
known better than

00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:27.153
to pal around with a Hojo.

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:29.906
Doctor Irie, any respect
I mighta had for you

00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:32.575
as a man is shot all to hell.

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:33.868
Hear us out, please.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.829
Satoko is one who bears
the Hojo family name.

00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:38.915
But she wasn't
involved in the dam war.

00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:40.625
‐‐She‐
‐‐[ORYO] Piss off!

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:42.793
Did I ask you a question?

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:46.547
'Cause I damn sure wasn't
lookin' for an answer!

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:49.634
I think you might be holding
your tongue, Keiichi.

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:52.261
If you care to add
something, please do.

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:53.513
Are you sure?

00:16:56.557 --> 00:16:58.809
My name is Keiichi Maebara.

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.937
Assume I know every
damn thing about you

00:17:00.978 --> 00:17:02.855
and get to the point.

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:05.441
[KEIICHI] It doesn't matter
what Satoko's family name is.

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:08.319
What matters is that she's
one of us and she's in trouble.

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.613
Did you not hear
a single word I said?

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:12.865
We're not ignoring
Satoko's situation,

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:15.243
we're just letting
the system do its job.

00:17:15.284 --> 00:17:16.786
Would it be right
for us to undermine

00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:20.331
the local government because
your friend is involved?

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:22.333
[KEIICHI] She's come to school
once since he came back,

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.210
and she was falling apart.

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:27.213
I'm scared to find out what
a whole month will do to her!

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:28.548
Do you not care
that a little girl

00:17:28.589 --> 00:17:31.592
from your village is going
through that kind of trauma?

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:32.468
Fine.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.470
Then what is it
you'd like us to do?

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:36.097
Anything, just hurry!

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:37.431
That's no problem.

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:39.600
We'll leave you
all to your business.

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:42.061
There's no need to
involve the Sonozaki name.

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:44.522
Your name's the only thing
that can help us now!

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.774
We won't get anywhere
with Child Welfare Services

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:50.361
unless the Hinamizawa village
council is on our side!

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:53.239
And we know they're all ready
to give us their support.

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.825
Grandma. Please let them.

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:58.744
Spineless bastards.

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:00.746
Who said it was their call?

00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:02.373
If you'll nod
your head for us once,

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:05.126
this will be the last you hear
about the issue, ma'am.

00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:09.130
Even if you can't say it out
loud, you can still nod.

00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:11.007
And what if she won't?

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:12.216
[KEIICHI]
Then I'll bash her brains out

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:13.759
all over the floor right here,

00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:16.095
and Mion will help us
when she takes over.

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:18.973
You do not know who you're
fuckin' around with, boy!

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:20.057
Kill the brat!

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:23.561
Stick a knife in him and drop
his ass down the old well!

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:26.564
Okay! If that's
how it's gonna be.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:29.900
Hope you liked dinner, you old
hag, 'cause it was your last!

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:31.819
[ORYO] You got one
more chance to piss off

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.487
without an extra hole in you.

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:35.615
You don't wanna push me,
you little punk!

00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:38.701
[KEIICHI] Satoko is my friend,
and I fight for my friends.

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:40.369
It's as simple as that!

00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:42.622
Isn't that what you would do?

00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:45.541
Gotta say, for an outsider,
you know your shit.

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:46.584
Outsider?

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:48.169
Get it right, you witch!

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.504
Hinamizawa Village is my home,

00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:51.839
and I'll always fight
for my neighbors

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:53.841
when they're in trouble!

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:55.551
[IRIE]
Please, Madame Oryo,

00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:57.511
it's true that
Maebara hasn't lived

00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:58.721
in the village very long yet.

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:00.681
But he's shown a
great deal of promise,

00:19:00.723 --> 00:19:03.017
and he'll do a
lot for our community.

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:04.769
I dunno where the
hell you been lookin',

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.145
but the only thing he's shown me

00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:08.898
is he's a rude little
son‐of‐a‐bitch.

00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:12.568
[KEIICHI] If that's the issue,
let me try a different approach.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:16.364
Satoko needs our help,
and we need the Sonozaki family!

00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:17.323
Please.

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.325
I beg of you!

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:23.287
Raise your head,
Keiichi, that's enough.

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.665
All right then,
Mother, what now?

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:27.124
Screw that crap.

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:29.627
Every damn Hojo is made
from the same mold,

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:32.004
they're all lying,
conniving bastards,

00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:34.715
and then there's this little
dirtbag who'd just met me

00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:37.134
when he threatened to
murder me in my own home!

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:38.052
Please, Grandma.

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:40.429
I always respected the way that
you fought for your friends,

00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:42.306
and that's what I'm doing now!

00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:43.557
'Cause back then.

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:44.558
I know you would have done

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.686
the same thing
for your neighbors!

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:48.521
[SHION]
Satoko is family to me.

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:49.980
I'm begging you, Grandmother.

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.441
Please help us!

00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:57.488
I bowed my head before,

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.782
and I don't plan
on doing it again.

00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:01.659
I'll ask one more time.

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:04.412
Please, help us. Help Satoko!

00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:07.707
If I nod my head to you,
what comes next?

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:09.041
The village council
will escalate

00:20:09.083 --> 00:20:11.460
our case with Child Welfare.

00:20:11.502 --> 00:20:14.296
Honestly, Satoko doesn't
deserve to go through this

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:16.716
and everyone agrees
on that, Oryo.

00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:17.758
For all of our sakes.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.262
I think it's high time we agree
to let her back in the fold.

00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:22.888
[ORYO]
The hell you say!

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.056
A Hojo's a Hojo,

00:20:24.098 --> 00:20:26.934
and we don't need any more
of 'em runnin' around here.

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:28.227
That settles it, then!

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:30.354
If you plan to be her enemy,

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:32.022
you're my enemy too!

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:34.150
Which means one of us
has to die here!

00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:35.067
[ORYO]
Augh!

00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:37.611
You're givin' me a headache,
you little bastard!

00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:39.029
You got no damn right.

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:41.282
I ain't gonna take this anymore!

00:20:41.323 --> 00:20:44.994
Please try not to burst
a blood vessel, Oryo.

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:46.328
I do apologize,

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.831
but I'll ask you to
leave it at that for tonight.

00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:49.790
Right now?

00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:51.709
But we still
don't have an answer!

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:52.877
[AKANE]
Keiichi.

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:56.797
You've pushed plenty far,
and it's time for you to stop.

00:20:56.839 --> 00:21:01.469
Come on. I think you've
done enough for now, Kei.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.428
[KEIICHI]
Dammit.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.305
We almost got to her!

00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:06.932
[RENA] You said everything
that needed to be said, Keiichi.

00:21:06.974 --> 00:21:09.560
It's up to Oryo to make
the right call now.

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:13.397
Not being able to do anything
but wait really sucks.

00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:15.816
How'd it go, Uncle Kimiyoshi?

00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:17.651
Is Grandma still mad?

00:21:19.153 --> 00:21:21.864
She gave the okay.

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:23.157
You won her over.

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:24.241
The village council will be

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:25.743
throwing their
full weight behind you,

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.703
with the demon's blessing.

00:21:27.745 --> 00:21:29.580
With that, you've just
won the official backing

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:32.124
of the Onigafuchi
Defensive Alliance.

00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:34.502
This battle should
be yours to lose now.

00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:36.253
Are you ready to follow through?

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:38.130
Yes, ma'am!

00:21:38.172 --> 00:21:40.299
You don't hesitate for a second.

00:21:40.341 --> 00:21:42.051
I like that in a man.

00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:43.552
Oh, uh.

00:21:43.594 --> 00:21:44.887
Thank you very much, ma'am!

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:46.680
No need for that, now.

00:21:46.722 --> 00:21:48.349
Our dear old demoness was afraid

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.476
that the only proper way
to resolve her grudge

00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:53.771
with the Hojos was to carry it
on with her to the grave.

00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:56.941
Deep down, I'm sure
she's feeling relieved.

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:59.527
One less loose end
to leave behind.

00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:01.904
[KEIICHI] I still owe her
my gratitude, though.

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:05.032
I must say, I find myself
quite impressed with you.

00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:07.368
It takes a man
to do what you did.

00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:10.538
My, Satoko. Nicely done.

00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:12.623
Stop it! That's not
what this is about!

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:14.750
You're saying
I've misunderstood?

00:22:14.792 --> 00:22:17.628
I'm relieved you two
still have a chance.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.380
‐‐[MION] Mom!
‐‐[SHION] Hey!

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.553
[RIKA]
Keiichi?

00:22:25.594 --> 00:22:26.512
After tonight,

00:22:26.554 --> 00:22:29.181
we should be able to
save Satoko from her fate.

00:22:29.223 --> 00:22:30.057
That's right.

00:22:30.099 --> 00:22:31.392
We're gonna help her,

00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:32.309
but I really wish you wouldn't

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:34.019
keep talking
about fate like that.

00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:35.729
I won't anymore.

00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:36.897
I understand.

00:22:36.939 --> 00:22:40.734
There's nothing to gain from
talking so much about fate.

00:22:40.776 --> 00:22:43.279
Because fate is
as flimsy as wet paper.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.239
And you're the one
who taught me that.

00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:46.782
Wait, when?

00:22:46.824 --> 00:22:48.158
That's a secret.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.869
Ni‐pah!

00:23:53.349 --> 00:23:56.560
