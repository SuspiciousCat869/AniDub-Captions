WEBVTT

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:21.605
[RENA]
Thank you, Lord Oyashiro.

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:26.652
[RENA] Guys, did any of you
notice Keiichi and Satoko

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.403
running off somewhere?

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.072
I'm pretty sure they
were still there with us

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:31.823
for most of the ceremony.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.368
We did finally reach
the end of a long battle.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.453
No doubt they're off
in some hidden spot now,

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:38.622
savoring the sweet
taste of victory.

00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:39.957
Awoo!

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:42.459
But why are those two
savoring it alone? Why?

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:43.710
[laughs]

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:45.379
They are at that age!

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.881
We're definitely gonna have
to give 'em the third degree

00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:49.925
when we catch up
with 'em tomorrow.

00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:53.262
Well, Hanyuu,

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:56.056
we had to push against
fate to rescue Satoko,

00:00:56.098 --> 00:00:58.433
but in the end,
we broke through it.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:01.979
So I know, even if
fate still wants me dead,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.772
as long as I have my friends,

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:06.358
we can break through it
one more time.

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.627
It doesn't look like Keiichi
and Satoko ever turned up, huh?

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:28.005
I'd probably better
make my way home too,

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:31.466
else Grandma's gonna force me
to talk with my relatives.

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.093
I think I'll go with you.

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:35.345
I can stay out in the
guest house for the night.

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:36.263
Huh?

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:38.140
Oh! Rika's here!

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:40.017
Something wrong, dear?

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:42.352
Have you seen Tomitake anywhere?

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:43.228
If you saw Takano,

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.397
then he may have been
somewhere close by.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.357
Yeah, I just
saw the two of them.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.234
They were out in
the parking lot.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.362
[ALL]
Huh?

00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:54.615
Ooishi's here?

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.742
[OOISHI chuckles]

00:01:56.783 --> 00:02:01.204
I finally found you.
Ms. Rika Furude!

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:04.333
[VILLAGER A]
Detective?

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:06.126
[VILLAGER B]
What the hell are you doing?

00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:10.339
[gags]
Why would you do this?

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:13.717
Rika!

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.385
[SHION]
What are you doing?

00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:18.472
Now I finally
understand everything!

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:20.140
[VILLAGER A]
Hey, whatever this is about‐‐

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:22.100
[gunshot]

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:27.564
[gunshot]

00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:32.736
[spluttering]

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.574
It's torture!

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:39.034
Damn it all.

00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:42.245
My neck itches like hell!

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.832
[RIKA]
How could it be Ooishi?

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:48.877
I finally understand the
truth behind Oyashiro's curse.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.672
Now confess and be done
with it, Rika Furude!

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.632
[RIKA]
What are you talking about?

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:55.217
[OOISHI]
All the mysterious deaths

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.594
that kept happening
during Watanagashi.

00:02:57.636 --> 00:02:59.388
It was all you!

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.515
[RIKA]
That's completely ridiculous,

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:04.726
but I think you're too
far gone to hear me now.

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:07.813
[OOISHI shrieks]
My throat is on fire!

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.982
This itching, and the curse,
and your part of it.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.652
It's all because of
this damn village!

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.494
[MION] Detective! As heir
to the Sonozaki Family,

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:26.456
I'm ready to hear you out,
so please, let her go!

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:29.751
You can't!

00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:34.089
[SHION]
Mion, grab Rika!

00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:36.216
[OOISHI]
Stay the hell outta my way!

00:03:36.258 --> 00:03:37.092
Leave her alone!

00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:38.468
‐‐Shion!
‐‐[RIKA] Make it stop.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.595
[gunshot]

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:44.766
This can't be real.

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:47.102
Please stop, I'm begging you.

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:49.771
Shion! Mion!

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:50.772
[MION]
Rena.

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:52.774
Take care of Kei for me!

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:55.026
[gunshot]

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.865
No!!

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.202
[RENA]
Rika! Please, stop!

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:06.913
[OOISHI]
Charade is over.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:09.499
You can't hide anymore,
now confess!

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:10.959
Rika Furude!

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:13.712
[RENA]
Please! Take me instead!

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:19.217
[RIKA] I really thought we
did everything right this time,

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.553
so how could it have
ended up like this?

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:24.055
[OOISHI]
What? Speak clearly.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:27.058
[RIKA] Do it.
I have nothing for you.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.018
Say it!

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.895
The secrets of
the curse die with me,

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.438
and you'll die knowing nothing.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.023
[OOISHI]
You're gonna tell me!

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:42.991
[OOISHI] Tell me! Tell me!
Tell me! Tell me!

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:52.709
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:55.629
[RENA]
Satoko! Stay away!

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:39.357
[screams]

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:42.235
It's okay. You're no longer
in any danger, Rika.

00:06:45.322 --> 00:06:47.490
[HANYUU] The pain you
feel is but a memory.

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:50.285
You need only calm down
and it will quickly subside.

00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:52.621
[RIKA gasping]

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:53.705
Ooishi.

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.957
He's the one who killed me.

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:57.334
Huh?

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:58.209
[gasps]

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:02.547
Somehow I'm able to remember
who my killer was this time!

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.090
What's happening?

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:05.592
[HANYUU]
As I told you before.

00:07:05.634 --> 00:07:09.054
I am only a remnant of Hanyuu
that lingers on in this space.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.056
I have little power
left to give.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.475
Right, and you still
have no way of escaping

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.226
from this dimension.

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:16.144
That's unfortunate,

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:17.771
because I would've really
liked to have shared

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:19.564
a drink with you right now.

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:20.732
I'd love a cream puff,

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:24.110
but I would rather not have
any of that red juice, please.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.659
Please listen to me, Rika.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.493
[RIKA]
Huh?

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:34.120
[HANYUU] At the cost of the
sliver of power I had left.

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.622
I've been able
to temporarily restore

00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:38.208
all your abilities
to their full potential.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:39.250
[RIKA]
Huh?

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.086
[HANYUU]
Whenever you begin a new cycle.

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:42.879
you shall now retain
your complete memory

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:46.174
of the cycle preceding it.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.926
In other words,
every time I die,

00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:50.428
I'll remember who my killer was.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.264
[HANYUU] Yes, and this is
what will allow you to learn,

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.058
how to live, to fight,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.937
to stand against fate
as one who lives in loops.

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:03.483
With what little is left of me,
it's as much as I can do.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:06.194
[RIKA] Was that really
what you believed I wanted?

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:09.698
Well, you must know by now,
but this Hinamizawa...

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:12.117
..is not the one
from five years ago.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.869
[RIKA]
Of course. It's different.

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:17.497
The first time,
Keiichi was paranoid.

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:19.499
He started to suspect Rena,

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:20.417
but I gave him a hint

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:23.211
that he needed to
believe in his friends.

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:29.050
And he took my advice, but even
so, that world ended in tragedy.

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:32.137
Shion went on a
rampage in the next world.

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.055
The doll that brought
that about in my Hinamizawa

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:36.808
ended up in Mion's hands.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.061
And though that act put us
on a different path than before.

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.772
It still ended in my death.

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:45.191
I lost my memory
after that loop.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:47.485
I don't know who
killed me, or how.

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:51.489
And if I had, maybe
I could have prevented it.

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.825
I'm sure you'll
figure it out in time.

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:54.909
[RIKA]
Really?

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:57.996
What could I figure out that
would have saved me from Ooishi?

00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:00.081
Will I learn to dodge bullets?

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:05.128
[RIKA] Forgive me, I know
you're not to blame for this.

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:07.589
Hanyuu?

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.383
I'm sure you'll
figure it out in time.

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.677
Yes, you already said that.

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:14.012
Huh?

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:18.141
You have many wonderful
friends on your side.

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:19.809
Keiichi and Rena are there,

00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:22.687
along with Mion,
and Shion, and Satoko,

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.314
and there are more besides.

00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:26.399
You're my friend, too, Hanyuu.

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:27.525
[giggles]

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:28.568
I need you.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.946
Having you here does more for me
than any power you can give me.

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:34.199
So you can't disappear!

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:37.702
Rika.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.537
I could see that
your soul was exhausted

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.831
after your hundred‐year journey.

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:43.583
Then you broke free,
and for five years,

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:46.127
your weary heart had
a chance to mend,

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:48.505
but that will quickly be undone.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:51.841
Those who live in loops are
not bound to a physical body.

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:54.094
Their consciousness
persists without.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:56.179
And I went through
hell because of that!

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:57.388
For a century.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.725
A hundred years in Hinamizawa,
caged like a bird!

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:04.437
Helplessly witnessing tragedy
after senseless tragedy!

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.481
It took a miracle for
Keiichi and the others

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:08.858
to keep my soul alive this long!

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.945
I lived through 1983 and
the five years after it,

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:14.030
but now I'm trapped
in this little girl's body

00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:15.698
all over again!

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.034
I finally escaped
from that village.

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:21.079
I grew up, and moved on,
and started a new life!

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.705
Then suddenly,
after all those years,

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:25.208
I was dragged
back to Hinamizawa!

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.461
Do you understand
what that means?

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:30.547
Even if this new power works.

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:33.675
Even if I can break the cycle
again, years could pass,

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:37.512
and I could still wake up
in 1983 again someday!

00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:39.973
I might never be free!

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:41.641
I'm so sorry.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.601
I need to know
you're here, or else,

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:47.313
I'll have to fight this
endless battle by myself!

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:54.571
[sobs]

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.406
[HANYUU]
Rika, this is something I hoped

00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:58.700
I would never have
cause to tell you.

00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:03.496
But for your sake, it
shall be my parting message.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:06.624
In truth, of the many
artifacts bearing my name,

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.126
there is one more holy,

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:11.254
one more powerful
than any other by far.

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:15.049
It's a sword by the
name of Onigari‐no‐ryuou.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.802
Its blade has the ability
to sever the loops.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.804
and offer an end
to those for whom death

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:22.182
is but another beginning.

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.851
It can kill
someone looping through worlds?

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:27.145
[HANYUU] You'll find the
sword hidden inside the statue

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:29.397
locked away in the
ritual tool storehouse.

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:31.024
Why would you tell
me about that?

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:34.152
Who is this looper
I'm supposed to kill?

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:38.573
[HANYUU] When I faded
into the sea of shards,

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:43.661
I didn't hope for us
to reunite like this.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.331
But you are not just
a mere fledgling anymore.

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:48.416
Huh?! No!

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:50.710
This is our last farewell, Rika.

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:53.838
From here on, your life and
your future are yours to shape,

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.381
and yours alone.

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:56.716
Don't go!

00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:58.551
Stop, Hanyuu!

00:11:58.593 --> 00:11:59.802
Wait.

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:01.346
Please!

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.100
Don't forget to enjoy
a cream puff for me

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:08.019
every now and again, okay?

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.146
I could only hold on
through those hundred years

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:11.648
because I had you!

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:12.482
Please.

00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:13.983
Don't leave me now.

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.360
I need you here!

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:17.445
You can't go!

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.325
I can't do this.

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:24.994
Please don't leave me, Hanyuu.

00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:29.624
[sobs]

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:32.377
[RIKA gasps]

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:34.003
Hanyuu!

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:37.632
[SATOKO]
Well, I see you're awake.

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:38.633
Even on a weekend,

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:42.387
it's rather slovenly
of you to sleep so late.

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:45.974
Don't worry, I've already
gotten to work on breakfast.

00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:47.684
Wait. Rika.

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:50.770
Did you wake from
a bad dream just now?

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:55.692
Yes, a terrible dream.

00:12:55.733 --> 00:13:01.072
It may have been the
worst one I've ever had.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:04.701
And what happened in it?

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:07.120
Honestly, I completely forgot.

00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:09.414
Nipaa.

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:10.665
Well, if it was that bad,

00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:14.544
maybe it's for the best
that it didn't stay with you.

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:15.503
Wash your face.

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:16.796
I need you in the kitchen.

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:36.649
[phone rings]

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:39.402
[SATAKO] Who could be
calling at this hour?

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.612
Would you mind finishing
these for me, Rika?

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:49.787
[RIKA] Why would you
tell me about that?

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:53.249
Who is this looper
I'm supposed to kill?

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:55.418
The answer to that is clear.

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:00.715
[SATOKO] We've been called
to an emergency meeting!

00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:03.259
Mion asked us to report
for a club activity!

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:04.969
We need to get ready
to meet them at school

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:07.680
an hour from now!

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.725
[RIKA] Actually, I have some
business to take care of today.

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:12.643
Sorry, but I won't be
able to make the meeting.

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:14.479
Surely you're joking right now!

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.563
The rules clearly state,

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:18.483
anyone who misses a
meeting will be punished!

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:20.401
[RIKA]
Mii.

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:23.488
[SATOKO] So how urgent is
this "business" of yours?

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:26.699
Does it really have
to be done right away?

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:29.077
I suppose it's not
all that urgent.

00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:30.495
[SATOKO] Then there's
no reason it can't wait

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:32.372
till after club, is there?

00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:33.289
You know you'd regret it

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:35.291
when punishment
time came around.

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:36.709
Yeah, you're right.

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:37.877
I'm sure I would.

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.587
Well, that settles it, then!

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:40.922
Now, shall we eat?

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:43.925
We can take off as soon
as we finish breakfast.

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:47.887
Morning, Rika!

00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:49.347
Morning. Satoko!

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.057
[MION]
Kept us waiting today.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:52.266
Sorry everybody.

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:55.019
We had a slow start
this morning.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.897
[KEIICHI]
You okay, Rika?

00:14:57.939 --> 00:14:59.273
Mii...

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.984
She's been a bit out of
sorts since she woke up.

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:03.069
Stay up too late?

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:04.570
Did you not sleep well?

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:06.531
[SATOKO]
She said she had a bad dream,

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:09.033
although she couldn't
remember what it was about.

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:11.536
Awoo! She must've
been so cute all huddled up

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:13.913
under the covers
and shaking! Can I‐‐

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:16.165
No, you can't take her home.

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.501
Was your sister
going to come too?

00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:19.544
Huh?

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:22.630
Well, honestly, I hadn't even
thought to invite Shion.

00:15:22.672 --> 00:15:25.716
But I could call her and ask her
to come out if you want!

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:27.385
No, that's okay.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.846
[KEIICHI] You really
do seem out of it today.

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:32.723
[RENA] Do you think you
might be getting sick?

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.100
No, it's not that.

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:35.852
I know! How's this?

00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:37.728
Rika should pick the game today!

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:38.563
If you're feeling down,

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:40.565
that should cheer
you up in no time!

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.150
Yeah. Great idea!

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:43.693
Yes, that's perfect!

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:45.027
What better than a rousing game

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:47.405
to lift up that
flagging spirit of yours?

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:49.073
Sounds good!

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:51.325
But whatever you pick,
I'm gonna win!

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:52.952
What'll it be?

00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:55.413
[RIKA]
I'd like to play hide and seek.

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:56.831
Hide and seek?

00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:58.374
Not what I expected.

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.251
But it's always fun, right?

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:02.712
Okay, so where will
the boundaries be?

00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:04.380
Would the school grounds work?

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:07.175
I should say we'll need
a bigger arena than that.

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:10.094
[RIKA] Any place in
Hinamizawa will be fair game.

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.971
As in the entire village?

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:13.598
That may be too big.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:15.349
[chortles]

00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:17.685
With my trapping skills
and knowledge of the terrain,

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:19.437
I certainly won't be caught.

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:23.107
Actually, in this version,
the only one hiding is me.

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:25.026
[MION]
How's that work?

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:26.152
[RIKA]
It's simple.

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:28.321
I'm going to be
somewhere in the village.

00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:30.531
Find me by sundown and you win.

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:32.575
[KEIICHI]
And what happens if we can't?

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:34.118
If you can't,

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.079
then I'll just have to make
the journey home all by myself!

00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:39.499
So we're gonna be racing
against the clock then.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.791
Sounds like fun.

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:43.336
Looking all over Hinamizawa
should be a real challenge.

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:46.672
Yeah, but we're still definitely
gonna find you, Rika!

00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:48.466
Good luck.

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:49.300
Don't give up, you guys!

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.010
So, would ten minutes
be enough time

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:52.970
for you to find a good spot?

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:54.138
[RIKA]
That'll be plenty.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.681
[MION]
Then let's do it!

00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:58.226
Hiding time starts now!

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:05.024
I really don't think
you'll be able to find me.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:07.318
[KEIICHI] Isn't it a little
early to call the game?

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.903
Well, if you can't find me

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:10.947
and you feel really
sad about it later,

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:13.449
please know it's not your fault.

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:36.305
[RENA]
That was ten minutes, right?

00:17:36.347 --> 00:17:38.683
[KEIICHI]
Yeah, let's get started!

00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:43.437
[MION]
How 'bout we all split up?

00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:45.189
Ol' Mion has got
a sneaking suspicion

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:47.108
about the school grounds.

00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:48.359
[SATOKO]
If you're covering here,

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:50.403
then I'll head
for the shrine first.

00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:52.321
[KEIICHI] I'll check along
the road to the school.

00:17:52.363 --> 00:17:54.907
[RENA] I know a perfect
hiding spot in the village.

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:57.285
I'm gonna check
if Rika knows it too!

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:59.078
[KEIICHI]
Then we'll catch up later!

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:07.795
[MION]
Oh Rika!

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:10.590
You know there's
no hiding from me!

00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:16.679
[MION]
And gotcha!

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:18.222
Oh.

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:19.515
[SATOKO]
Rika!

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:21.976
I know this is
where you're hiding,

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:25.730
so you may as well come out now!

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.816
[RENA]
Hey, Rika!

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:30.818
Are you in here?

00:18:35.698 --> 00:18:37.116
[KEIICHI]
Rika's pretty sharp,

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:39.619
and this would be
an obvious spot, huh?

00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:44.624
[KEIICHI]
We already missed sundown, too.

00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:50.713
Rika didn't skip out
on us, did she?

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:51.756
[KEIICHI]
Mm.

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:54.175
She may have gone home
when the sun set.

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:56.260
That's what
she said she would do.

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:58.846
It looks like we're just gonna
have to take the loss this time

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:00.931
and ask her where
she was hiding tomorrow.

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:03.351
Then I'll give her a
thorough interrogation.

00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:05.227
So that's it.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:10.691
[KEIICHI]
Hold on a sec.

00:19:10.733 --> 00:19:12.735
[ALL 3]
Huh?

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:16.906
Didn't it seem like Rika
was hoping that we'd find her?

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:19.909
I really don't think
you'll be able to find me.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.202
Yeah, it did!

00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:22.787
I will say she's
been acting strange

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:24.580
since she woke up this morning.

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:26.957
She just told me
she had a bad dream,

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.417
but I think it may
be something deeper

00:19:28.459 --> 00:19:30.044
that's been troubling her.

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:32.755
If that's true, then we can't
give up the search yet!

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.507
The sun may have already set,

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:37.385
but even if we can't win
the game, we'll find Rika!

00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:39.345
[ALL]
Mm.

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:40.179
[KEIICHI]
Mion!

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:41.389
Where's somewhere in the village

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.224
where nobody
would think to look?

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:45.685
[MION]
Hmm...

00:19:45.726 --> 00:19:46.811
[gasps]

00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:05.454
[door opens]

00:20:30.521 --> 00:20:32.440
[RIKA]
Where is it?

00:20:35.693 --> 00:20:37.695
It's not here.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.865
Silly Hanyuu.

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:42.950
Where did it go?

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:46.162
Where's the sword
you had promised me?

00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:48.497
That parting gift
I never asked you for.

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:51.208
You offered it to me
and now it's not here!

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:58.632
[laughs]

00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:05.681
[sobs]

00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:07.725
Huh?

00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:18.903
It looks like there's
still enough of it left

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:21.530
to fulfill its ultimate purpose.

00:21:33.334 --> 00:21:35.002
[KEIICHI]
Rika!

00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:36.128
[SATOKO]
Rika!

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.506
If you can hear us,
please come out!

00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:39.715
[RENA]
You won, Rika!

00:21:39.757 --> 00:21:41.550
Now come talk to us, okay?

00:21:41.592 --> 00:21:43.260
[MION] You may have
beaten us this time.

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:45.888
but tomorrow's
another day, got it?

00:21:49.517 --> 00:21:52.770
With this shard,
I finally have a way out.

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:55.397
Thank you, Hanyuu.

00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:56.941
Knowing I can die when I'm ready

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:59.902
makes it that much
easier to go on living.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.868
[RIKA]
Five more loops.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.121
I'll try to set this world
right for five more loops.

00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:17.837
And then, I'll surrender.

00:23:49.887 --> 00:23:53.265
[RIKA] Next time:
<i>Nekodamashi‐hen</i>. Part Two.
