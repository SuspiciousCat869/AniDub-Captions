[school bell tolls]

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:24.608
‐‐Huh?
‐‐Ahh!

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.319
Lady Rika just arrived!

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:34.368
Good tidings to you.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.579
[STUDENT C, D]
Good tidings to you!

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:42.125
Lady Rika looked directly
into my eyes and spoke to me!

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:45.629
Good tiding‐‐

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:47.172
How's your morning, Rika?

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:50.300
By the look of you, it seems
as if it's going quite well.

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:51.635
Satoko.

00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:53.303
Watch your tone, Ms. Hojo.

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:54.388
You need to show respect

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.848
when addressing someone
of Rika's stature.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.559
Please pardon me, ladies.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.768
I'm trying to
have a conversation

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.436
with my friend here.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:05.190
If it offends you,
feel free not to take part.

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:07.568
Your lack of manners
is appalling!

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:11.488
Satoko.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.447
I'm sorry.

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:15.158
We haven't had many
opportunities to talk lately,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.369
I know, but I'll try to find
some time this after‐‐

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:19.246
Hey, Rika?

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.165
Don't you think your
Little Miss High Society act

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:23.542
is getting a bit old?

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:26.295
We both know you're not the
girl you're pretending to be.

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:27.963
Honestly, is this what I get

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:30.841
for putting myself through
all those years of studying?

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:31.800
And to think.

00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:33.927
I did it to make
your dream come true!

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.971
Satoko, I...

00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:41.852
I'm not doing this here.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.937
My nose was buried in
those books for so long,

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.981
it's a miracle
I stayed sane somehow,

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:47.899
but I still forced myself
to do it for the sake

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.776
of your boarding school fantasy!

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:51.111
Satoko!

00:01:52.154 --> 00:01:54.990
Our time at the village school
is behind us now.

00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:57.117
You're a student
of St. Lucia Academy,

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.160
and if you mean to stay here,

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.621
it would behoove you
to comport yourself accordingly.

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:02.623
This is starting to sound like
the principal's boring speech

00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:04.082
at the opening assembly.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.376
[RIKA]
I'm saying this for your sake!

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:08.754
Right. Sure you are.

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:19.139
I swear, the nerve of her,
addressing Rika that way!

00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:21.767
I understand the two of you
have been friends for some time,

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:25.228
but that hardly excuses her
making a spectacle in public.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.815
I must insist that you refrain
from speaking ill of Satoko.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:29.775
But, Rika...

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:33.070
She's gotten me out of
hundreds of tough situations.

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:34.655
When things are at their worst,

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:37.991
she always sets off the perfect
trap at the perfect time.

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:39.743
When you say, "trap"...

00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:40.786
That's right.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:43.038
She's quite a genius
with traps and pranks,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.373
and in general.

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:46.958
In truth, Satoko's a more
impressive person than me

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.419
in most every way
I can think of.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.757
Adjusting to this
environment is hard for her,

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.468
and the classes are more
rigorous than our old school.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.723
Right now, she's not
showing her best side,

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.851
but please, try not
to judge her for it.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.196
[sighs]
I swear.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.782
I'm fed up with this place.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.065
I get what's
going on here, Rika.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.693
After you spent so
long in the countryside,

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.862
of course you'd be entranced
by this gaudy building

00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:41.239
and all these frivolous rituals.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.200
It'll pass soon enough.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.076
'Cause I've played
with you in club,

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.037
and you were as
passionate as any of us

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:49.790
about goofing off.

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.500
You need to be
reminded of the fun

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:54.377
you had in Hinamizawa.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.089
And then, you'll go back
to being the real Rika.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.977
Good tidings to you, Lady Rika!

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.687
Good tidings to you.

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.065
[STUDENT B]
Lady Rika. Good tidings!

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:16.983
[RIKA]
Good tidings.

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.026
Oh, Rika.

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:20.028
You've clearly started
to forget yourself,

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.365
but you're about
to get a big reminder.

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:28.620
Huh?

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:29.746
[loud crashing]

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:31.039
[screaming]

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:32.666
[chortles]

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.584
Had you forgotten
the sting of defeat?

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:35.961
How does it feel?

00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:38.588
[GIRL B]
Are you okay?

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.881
[gasps]

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:43.051
[TEACHER]
Such a childish prank.

00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:44.302
Who would dare?

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.388
Get to the infirmary
immediately.

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:50.308
The rest of you,
to class, right now!

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.021
Hold on. But I...
didn't mean to hurt anybody.

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:57.858
Huh?

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.419
[TEACHER]
It's simply disgraceful.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.672
Such a wanton act,
in these hallowed halls!

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:25.343
Do you girls have any idea
who could be responsible?

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.137
No, ma'am.

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:29.890
Very well, ladies.

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.683
Don't delay, please.

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:34.519
Head to class
once she's seen to.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.192
[GIRL C]
Ma'am!

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:42.402
[TEACHER]
Hmm?

00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:45.196
Can I help you?

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:48.116
Yes, ma'am. I think...

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:50.827
I might know
who was responsible.

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.203
[TEACHER]
Hmm?

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.085
[TEACHER]
Ms. Hojo.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.256
You need to come with me.

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.061
You'll be staying a while.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.896
It is my sincere hope
that you'll take this time

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:21.066
to reflect on the
choices you've made.

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.568
Choices? What did I do?

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.030
Enough. Another student told me
you delight in causing mischief,

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:29.616
with traps being your specialty.

00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:33.995
We know you snuck out.

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:35.288
We have the footage.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.124
You had both a motive
and an opportunity.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:41.461
Would you care to
speak in your defense?

00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:47.509
[TEACHER] Then I strongly urge
you to use this time alone

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.594
to think about what you've done.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.805
[gasps]

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:52.889
Wait!

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:54.182
[TEACHER]
The sooner you see reason,

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:56.476
the sooner you can
rejoin your classmates.

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:58.645
Hold on. You can't do that!

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.438
I'm a student, not a prisoner!

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.401
How can you just lock
me up in a cell like this?

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:06.611
It's not right.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:10.323
[SATOKO]
I shouldn't...

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:12.367
I shouldn't be here.

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.873
Why...? Why couldn't I...?

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.583
And if there's a way,

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:24.629
I really want you to be a part
of that dream too, Satoko.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.464
It looks like that
stubborn streak of yours

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:27.716
is coming out again.

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:30.051
Why couldn't I just tell her no?

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:33.054
Why did I go along with her?

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.556
Fine, then, I'm with you.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:37.017
Let's get into your
fancy‐pants school.

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.894
[sobs]

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.855
I gave up years of
my life for something

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:45.066
I never even wanted!

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:46.860
Let me take it back.

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:48.987
Please, let me start over!

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.698
I wanna make it
like it never happened!

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.826
[sobs]

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.577
So today is the day?

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:58.223
[TEACHER] As of the
beginning of your second year,

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.809
you're going to be
joining the Special Class.

00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:06.272
You'll have the opportunity
to rejoin the Regular Class

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:07.982
if your grades
improve sufficiently,

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:11.277
so it would be wise to
take your studies seriously.

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:14.155
[SATOKO] If that was a joke,
it wasn't very funny.

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:15.865
[TEACHER] I have every
confidence that this is

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:20.537
within your capability,
provided you make the effort.

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:21.788
Do you?

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.082
Then why can't you
look me in the eye.

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:57.365
[gasps]

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.828
Mion sent this?

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:11.212
[SATOKO]
Hinamizawa Village School

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:15.300
Game Club Founders' Reunion?

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:16.634
"I'm sure we've all grown used

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.887
to how people live
in the real world."

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:20.388
[MION] "But as members
of the game club,

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.223
I hope you
remember what matters.

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:24.058
Victory at any cost!"

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.436
Let us meet again in Hinamizawa.

00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:29.981
And revel once more
in the spilling of blood!

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:34.402
Okay, it's time.

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:35.904
Are you ready?

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:38.865
The war wagon is here to carry
you off to the field of battle.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:41.075
And the school
even agreed to let us go.

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:42.243
[RIKA]
Mm‐hmm.

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:43.494
Good to hear it!

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:44.913
Then let's be off, ladies!

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.831
Onward, to the slaughter!

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:50.501
[MION]
Jeez.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:51.669
You damn near
gave your Uncle Mion

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:54.255
a heart attack
growin' up that fast.

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:55.548
So hey, Rika.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.426
How tough is it dealing
with all the attention you get?

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.345
I'd say you've done
quite a bit of growing up

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:02.680
yourself since last
we saw each other.

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.266
And you get at least as
much attention from Keiichi.

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:06.851
[laughs]

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.646
That's definitely
the Rika I remember.

00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:11.397
It's good to know you haven't
changed that much

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:12.982
in all these years.

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:17.528
Mii. I may be a proper lady now,
but I'm still myself.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.488
You're in college.

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:20.198
How's that been going for you?

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.282
Aren't Keiichi and Rena both

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:23.326
going to the same
school as you now?

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:24.244
That's right.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:25.787
We're at Gogura U.

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:27.538
It was a lot of fun,
getting to introduce

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.332
my two favorite rookies
to the game club

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:31.084
for the second time.

00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:32.043
And now the three of you

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:34.629
have the entire campus
at your mercy.

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:36.339
We just need you two.

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:38.633
Meaning, you better
hurry up and graduate.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:39.759
Make it through St. Lucia,

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:43.596
and you can walk right
through the door at Gogura.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:44.722
Speaking of the others.

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:45.807
I had forgotten to ask

00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:47.558
where they're going
to be meeting us.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.018
Actually, come to think of it,

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.813
I never asked you what our
plans for the day were, either.

00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:53.564
[MION]
Wait. Wasn't it in the letter?

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:54.774
Huh?

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:58.778
It's the official Village School
game club founders' reunion.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:02.156
You know what we're doing.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:04.200
And you know where.

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:05.618
That's right!

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:11.833
Hinamizawa.

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:14.627
You don't know how much
I've missed you.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:18.589
I'm so excited to
be here again! Ni‐paa!

00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:28.558
[KEIICHI]
Hey, Satoko and Rika are here!

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.935
Awoo! It's good
to see you again!

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:32.812
I hope the ride wasn't too long.

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:34.605
It was far too long.

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:39.027
Mii. It was hard on her,
having to sit down so long.

00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:40.153
It was!

00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:42.196
You would know if you'd
ever shared a small space

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:45.450
with anyone who drools
and snores as much as you.

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:47.827
Awoo! Make her stop!

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:50.538
Rena, Satoko is
being mean to me!

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.373
Awooo!

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:54.959
I don't care how much you
snore and drool and cry!

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.879
You'll always
be the cutest, Rika!

00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:05.845
It seems Rena still
punches above her weight.

00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:07.930
But why did she hit me?

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:10.933
Now, let's do what
we came here for.

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:27.533
All right, club is
in session for today!

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:29.494
Is everybody in agreement?

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:31.412
[ALL]
Aye!

00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:32.246
We've got one day,

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:34.123
and we're gonna
use every minute of it!

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:35.666
Wouldn't have it any other way!

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.794
So, what are we doing first?

00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:39.295
Let's see.

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:44.592
There it is!

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:47.345
Heh. Now it's official.

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:48.888
We've got the whole club here.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.223
[KEIICHI]
Oh, no way!

00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:55.144
You can recognize an old friend
from behind, can't you?

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:57.313
I remember that crease!

00:14:57.355 --> 00:14:59.023
[ALL 4]
That's the six of spades!

00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:01.275
Good work!

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:04.654
Even after all this time,
none of you have lost a step.

00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:06.864
Our first game of
the day is Millionaire!

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.783
House rules are
the same as always.

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:09.784
What better way to get started

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:11.828
than by busting
out the old deck!

00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:12.662
Hang on.

00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:15.415
When you refer to "house rules,"
you mean playing dirty?

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:17.375
What was rule number two?

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:18.960
Do anything and
everything in your power

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:21.212
to claim victory! Always!

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:23.714
A dirty win is better
than a fair loss!

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:26.050
That's the only way
the five of us can play!

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.176
[gasps]

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:33.182
[chortles]

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:34.434
That's perfect!

00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:36.227
Restricting ourselves
to conventional tactics

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:37.687
wouldn't do at all!

00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:40.606
And penalties are
on the table, of course.

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:42.859
[RIKA]
How are we handling those?

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.527
[chuckles]

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:47.238
The same way we used
to do it back in the day!

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.948
We all write down
our punishments,

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.576
and whoever loses the
game picks one out of a hat.

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:53.161
[chortles]

00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:54.328
Then I'll put down
the worst thing

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.706
I can possibly think of
and go after Keiichi!

00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:59.709
Now that I know your plan,
I can turn it around on you!

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.961
I'm sure this will be
great fun to watch.

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:03.671
Ni‐paa!

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:04.964
[MION]
Let's do it!

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:06.507
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:16:09.927 --> 00:16:12.138
Good try, Rena,
but I got there first.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.683
Awoo... Looks like
I lost this time.

00:16:20.021 --> 00:16:21.731
"Pretend to be a maid"?

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:25.568
I don't even know where
to start with doing that!

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.278
Forgive me, Master!

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.697
Honestly, I'd say that
was more than adequate.

00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:33.034
[RENA]
I won't lose again!

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:35.703
Hey, looks like I'm out! Yes!

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:39.832
Sometimes your luck is too
awful to be overcome by tactics.

00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:44.003
"Talk like you're
our little sister?"

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:47.340
Please pick a better
penalty, big brother.

00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:49.175
[MION
"Put on your school swimsuit"?

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:53.137
Ugh! Dammit, I wrote
this down for Kei!

00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:57.850
Hang in there, Rika.

00:16:57.892 --> 00:17:00.269
We still gotta make
Kei lose at least once!

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:09.612
Heck yeah!

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:11.072
The wins just keep comin'!

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:13.866
Better luck next time, Rika!

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:14.909
Well then.

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:16.244
Rules are rules.

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:26.003
Mii. Mii! Mii! Mii!

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:28.381
Awoo! You're too cute!

00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:31.133
I wanna take you home with me!

00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:33.469
Mii. And meow
you're the only one left

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:34.929
who can avenge me, Rena!

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:37.056
[RENA] Awoo!
I'll give it my all!

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:38.599
Awoo! Awoo! Awoo!

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:40.977
[KEIICHI] You would even
turn Rena against me, huh?

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:45.147
Let's see how you like this!

00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:46.899
Revolution!

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.484
No!

00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:50.945
I declare a
Counter‐Revolution, Master!

00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:53.906
Can this be how it ends?

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:56.200
Mii. There goes my last card.

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:57.451
Looks like that's it.

00:17:57.493 --> 00:17:59.495
Yeah, me too. I'm all done.

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.163
Yes, that'll do it.

00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:03.874
[KEIICHI growls]
Crap!

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:07.712
Man. I was on a crazy winning
streak, right up until the end.

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:09.213
Ugh!

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.842
Not that there's any doubt,

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:14.427
but did you all write
down the same penalties

00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:16.429
you used back then?

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.930
Yeah, I guess we did.

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:19.599
I know I went with the usual.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.642
I'm so screwed, aren't I?

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.855
"Every penalty
handed out today"?

00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:27.898
You seriously expect
me to do that?

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.275
For starters, where do you
think we're gonna find

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:31.777
a school swimsuit
I can wear right now?

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:33.446
What's wrong with this one?

00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:36.157
I would be totally cool
with letting you borrow it.

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:38.993
[RIKA] And I'm sure my kitty
ears will fit you just fine.

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:40.620
Ni‐paa!

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:46.709
No fleeing the battle, Keiichi!

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:49.045
I can't let you leave,
brother dear.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:55.384
Good work, Satoko!

00:18:55.426 --> 00:18:56.927
As you should expect.

00:18:56.969 --> 00:19:00.473
Now, Keiichi, time to settle
down and be a good boy.

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:03.476
Um, I apologize for my conduct.

00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:08.439
Forgive me, Master!

00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:13.361
[MION] Man, I'll never forget
seeing you in that swimsuit.

00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:14.278
[sighs]

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.238
Happy to amuse you.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.407
Poor, poor, pitiful Keiichi!

00:19:18.449 --> 00:19:19.575
Hey, it's okay!

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:22.870
I thought you...
you looked really cute.

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:24.955
Right, and you
sound really sincere.

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:26.332
Yeah, I know.

00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:27.708
But honestly,
it was such a good idea

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.543
to get everyone together
here at the schoolhouse

00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:31.545
for a whole day of games!

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:33.798
[KEIICHI]
Mm. I'm glad I came.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.424
[MION]
Mm.

00:19:35.466 --> 00:19:38.552
Yes, I had fun.

00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:39.679
So what's next?

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.764
Do we have plans for
the evening as well, Mion?

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:43.557
Yeah, back in Okinomiya.

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:45.935
We'll be hitting up
Angel Mort for dinner.

00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:46.894
Shion'll be there.

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:47.853
[KEIICHI]
Awesome!

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:50.439
And you're obviously
gonna be buying, right, Mion?

00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:52.483
"Obviously," huh?

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:55.236
Though I guess I owe
you for the eye candy.

00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:57.446
So sure. It's on me.

00:19:57.488 --> 00:19:59.115
[RENA]
This is the best day ever!

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:00.783
[MION]
We're all good with that right?

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:02.451
Then hop in!

00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:03.911
We're leaving already?

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:06.831
Even though we
just got back here?

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:08.833
What's up, Satoko?

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:10.334
Actually, I had been hoping

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:12.795
to take a walk
around Hinamizawa.

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:15.047
Uh. Want us to come with?

00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:17.842
[chortles]
No, that's all right,

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.094
I'd prefer if it was
just the village and me.

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:21.762
Go ahead, I can
come give you a ride

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:23.639
to Angel Mort
whenever you're ready.

00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:25.349
Just give 'em a call.

00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:26.475
[SATOKO]
Thank you.

00:20:26.517 --> 00:20:29.520
Stay safe, okay?

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:31.397
I'll see you at
the restaurant, then.

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:34.316
Yes, I'll be
looking forward to it.

00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:56.714
[VILLAGER B]
Heard they're knockin' down

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:58.132
the old schoolhouse.

00:20:58.174 --> 00:20:59.550
It was a long time comin',

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:01.802
seein's how the building's
hardly been worked on

00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:05.264
since it was a
Forest Service office.

00:21:41.425 --> 00:21:44.386
[VILLAGER A] Oh my goodness,
is that little Satoko?

00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:47.181
Pardon. What happened
to this building?

00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:48.891
[VILLAGER A]
Ah, that blizzard hit last year

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:50.768
and the whole thing caved in.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.228
It was in a bad state already,

00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:54.647
what with nobody
livin' there and all.

00:22:22.633 --> 00:22:23.801
Oh yeah.

00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:27.388
[SATOKO]
I remember this place.

00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:28.556
Once, when I was little,

00:22:28.597 --> 00:22:31.016
I got up on the roof
and snuck inside.

00:22:31.058 --> 00:22:32.977
Lord Oyashiro
must have been mad.

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:37.481
It was years ago, so hopefully,
he's gotten over it now.

00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:41.277
[high‐pitched sound]

00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:42.778
[SATOKO]
What is that sound?

00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:58.460
[SATOKO]
How odd.

00:22:58.502 --> 00:23:00.045
Is it in here?

00:23:01.714 --> 00:23:02.631
[gasps]

00:23:02.673 --> 00:23:04.258
What's happening?

00:23:09.722 --> 00:23:13.976
[high‐pitched sound]

00:23:18.856 --> 00:23:20.065
[gasps]

00:23:37.207 --> 00:23:38.500
[gasps]

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.797
[???]
It has been far too long.

00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:45.925
Child of man.

00:23:50.012 --> 00:23:53.557
[RIKA] Next time:
