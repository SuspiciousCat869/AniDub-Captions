WEBVTT

00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:22.439
What strange place is this?

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:24.525
Huh?

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.984
[gasps]

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:37.538
Rika.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:38.455
Oh, Hanyuu.

00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:40.332
What's going on?

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:41.542
We are currently caught

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:45.087
within a fragment linked
to numerous worlds.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:47.381
When I came to a second ago,

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:49.174
I had expected to see your face,

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:51.343
but for a moment
I was all alone.

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:56.515
Right now, only a faint trace
of me lingers on in this space.

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:58.100
A trace is enough for me.

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.519
I'm just glad you're
here by my side.

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:01.812
[gasps]

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:03.730
So, did I die?

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:05.190
Or did someone kill me?

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:07.943
Please forgive me,
but in this insubstantial form,

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:10.654
I'm afraid I'm not able
to answer that question.

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:12.906
[RIKA] Then can you
tell me this instead?

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:16.743
What is the destination
of this particular fragment?

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.204
You'll awake in 1983.

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:20.372
The month of June.

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:21.373
[RIKA gasps]

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:23.083
Why am I going back there?

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:26.336
Were one hundred years of
suffering not enough?

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:28.672
I really am sorry.

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:33.093
[RIKA]
Fine.

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:36.138
I'm different now.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.973
I'm not a naÃ¯ve little girl.

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:40.642
I'll be able to do more this
time than toss the dice

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:43.353
again and again
and hope for the best.

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:46.607
I've grown to
understand the world.

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:48.525
The rules of Hinamizawa.

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:52.237
And I know who kills
Rika Furude, as well.

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:53.905
Rika.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.616
We've earned our future,

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:59.828
and I will not fail to win it
back for us once again.

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:54.651
[KEIICHI] Armed with
hatchets and pickaxes,

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:57.779
the assailants brutally attacked
and murdered the victim,

00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:01.742
before using an axe to
sever his head and limbs.

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:02.659
[gassp]

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:05.620
[KEIICHI screams]

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.623
[shrieks]

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:12.502
Oh! Oh gosh!

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:13.628
Did I startle you?

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.796
Were you startled?

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.298
[KEIICHI]
No. I'm fine.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.216
[RENA]
Uh. Remember yesterday?

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.676
You said it would be
easier to get him out

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.636
if you had a saw or an axe.

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.263
So I brought out
something with me

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:24.973
from my house
today that might help!

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:27.184
[KEIICHI]
Ah. Perfect. My bad.

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:30.437
I guess I overreacted
a little bit there.

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.150
[RENA]
Jeez. I'm sorry for scaring you.

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:36.109
Sorry!

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:39.571
This will definitely be a big
help, but it's getting dark.

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:41.281
Let's call it for right now.

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:42.657
Yeah.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.284
Don't worry, it'll be fine!

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:45.786
We can come back tomorrow!

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:46.870
[RENA]
Hm?

00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:48.538
You're still willing to help me?

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.664
[KEIICHI]
Of course!

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:50.665
[gasps]

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:53.335
Thank you, Keiichi!

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.045
Just you wait, Kenta‐<i>kun</i>.

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.756
I'm gonna bring
you home with me!

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.473
[yawns]

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:17.943
No joke?

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.570
This actually counts
as a phys‐ed class?

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:23.740
[MION] How else could we do P.E.
for kids in every grade at once?

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:24.658
And it works.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.493
All we really need
is a chance to get up

00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:28.912
and move around
a little during the day.

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:30.664
Sorry for making you wait!

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:31.665
Well, Mion?

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:34.167
What have you
come up with for today?

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:37.587
It's a contest that will demand
both power and endurance.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.965
In the world of sports,
there are no teams.

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.383
Only rivals!

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:42.425
[KEIICHI]
That's not true.

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.719
So, for today, we're going back

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.222
to the mother of all
outdoor free‐for‐alls.

00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:49.182
That's right, kids.

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:50.392
Let's play tag!

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:51.726
[laughs]

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.228
Most amusing!

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.771
I'm not gonna let you win!

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:56.356
I'll give it my all!

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:59.109
Are you guys really
that excited to play tag?

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.443
[MION]
Club rule number three!

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.071
Partake in every game and
enjoy it without question!

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:05.240
What? It's a club thing now?

00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:06.700
I'm all in, then!

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:07.742
Let's play tag.

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:09.202
You're goin' down!

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:10.495
Hee hee hee.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:13.206
The twist is, this is zombie
tag, so once you're it,

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:14.875
you're it for
the rest of the game!

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.794
Why'd they give it a
scary name like zombie tag?

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:18.420
Scary!

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:20.630
Well, obviously,
you should be scared

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:22.924
of having your guts ripped out!

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.926
Stop being gross, Keiichi!

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:25.969
It'll be fine.

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:29.973
I'll get to you first and savor
you slowly, Rena! Ni‐pa!

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:32.809
Rika. She won't be "fine"
if you're eating her.

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:35.145
Stay alive until
the bell and you win.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:37.147
Short straw is the first zombie!

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:38.315
[laughs]

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.650
I already have
a brilliant plan in mind.

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:44.487
Those zombies are never gonna
get their rotting hands on me!

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.457
Tough luck, kid.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:59.044
Maybe next time you oughta
plan on getting a better draw.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.297
Hey, Tomita, Okamura?

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.383
Have either one of you seen
Keiichi somewhere around here?

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.676
Uh, yeah, we did.

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:07.469
Right there.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.470
[SATOKO]
Hmm?

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.471
No fair!

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:12.766
Who ever heard of a zombie
asking humans for help?

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:15.894
So we're doing information
warfare then, huh?

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.355
Could you deliver
a message for me?

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:21.191
Tell Satoko that her parents
are waiting for her at the gate.

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:23.360
Really? Okay!

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.195
[KEIICHI] Could you also
tell Mion that the teacher

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:27.572
is waiting for her
at the front gate too?

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:30.492
Yeah, sure. I'll tell her!

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.455
[chuckles]

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:39.709
I hate to do that to you, Mion,
but it buys me a little time.

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:42.253
Have you seen Maebara?

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.338
I was looking.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.174
Someone told me his
dad's waiting out front.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.635
Hey, have you guys seen Maebara?

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.804
His mom just got
rushed to the hospital!

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:53.848
Hey, you guys, I heard the
police are after Maebara!

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.851
Class rep Mion told me to tell
him to go to the front gate

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.979
'cause his house
was about to burn down.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.564
[KEIICHI] Of course,
you're behind this, Mion!

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:04.317
[RENA]
Ah! It's you, Rika!

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.569
Are you still alive?

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.947
I've managed to
pull through so far.

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:11.366
[RENA] Satoko and Mion
were chasing after me!

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:13.702
Well, you're safe here with me!

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:14.786
[RENA sighs]

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.871
That's such a relief.

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.292
Hey, Rika?

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:23.503
Please stop that. Stop it.

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:26.172
Don't come any closer, please.

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.216
Please don't come closer.

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:29.634
It won't hurt, Rena.

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.845
You won't feel a thing.

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:33.430
What won't hurt?

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:36.558
When I'm eating you alive. Mi!

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.351
Ohh. Would you really?

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:39.978
You wouldn't, Rika!

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.312
[shrieks]

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:44.649
Please help me, Keiichi!

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.110
Taking the high ground, Kei?

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:47.819
Soon enough,

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.822
we'll finally learn what
Keiichi's innards taste like.

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:51.573
[gasps]

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.241
Oh oh!

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:54.409
Oh, Keiichi.

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:56.327
Give up and join us
among the living dead,

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.288
and your troubles
will all be over.

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:00.749
You're taking this whole
zombie thing way too far!

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:01.833
Stay away!

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:05.837
Now savor the final
moments of your life, Kei!

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:09.090
[KEIICHI]
No! Somebody, help me!

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:17.307
So Rena ended up being
the only survivor, huh?

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:20.101
[SATOKO] She wouldn't have
if you weren't so slow, Keiichi!

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:21.519
What could I do?

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:24.731
I know I can trust you
no matter what, Keiichi.

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:28.359
'Cause you would never do
anything to hurt me, would you?

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.070
You wouldn't, right?

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:31.905
Look. She had my hands tied.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.782
I am only a man.

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:36.743
Either way, now time
for Keiichi's punishment!

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:39.662
[MION]
Game over!

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:40.789
And todays winners are:

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.500
Rena Ryugu and Mion Sonozaki!

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:44.793
Uh... Hold on.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:46.586
Didn't you end up a zombie?

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.588
We call that a disguise.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.340
No fair!

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:53.426
[KEIICHI]
Stop. Please, Rika!

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.220
You can't‐‐

00:09:57.806 --> 00:10:00.225
[KEIICHI]
Mion, you friggin' lying jerk.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:01.976
Huh?

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.311
[gasps]

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:08.149
Here, use this.

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.235
[KEIICHI]
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:13.530
[RENA]
Are you free today after school?

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:14.572
To help you out?

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:15.615
Yeah, of course.

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:18.243
Awoo! You're the best ever!

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:22.747
He's really gonna be mine!
Awoo! Awoo! Awoo! Awoo!

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:27.168
[RENA]
Cutey wutey Kenta‐<i>kun</i>!

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.422
[KEIICHI] Is it really okay to
carry that thing in the open?

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:34.801
Yeah, it's totally fine! Awoo!

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:36.511
Isn't it heavy? I don't mind‐‐

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:37.554
It's fine.

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:42.058
All right.

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:44.018
[KEIICHI]
Let's get started.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.019
Today's the day!

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.271
[RENA]
Mm!

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.114
[RENA]
Hang on, Kenta‐<i>kun</i>.

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:57.699
Just hold out for a bit longer

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.951
and Keiichi will be
there to rescue you!

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:08.209
[pants]

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:10.336
Yeah. I'm all fired up!

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:12.839
The mission's over, Colonel!

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:14.507
We're bringing you home!

00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:30.940
Huh?!

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:34.068
[gasps]

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:40.450
What's the matter?

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:42.577
Oh, everything's fine.

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:11.689
[roars]

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:12.440
All right!

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.567
Rena, can you help me
pull him out of here?

00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:15.693
[RENA]
Mm!

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:19.280
[RENA, KEIICHI]
One, two, three!

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.245
Ahh! I got my very
own Kenta‐<i>kun</i>!

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:26.746
He's the kyutest ever!

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:29.666
[KEIICHI] Looking up close,
he's in pretty bad shape, huh?

00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:32.669
Be careful or
he might lose an arm.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.546
Rumor is, there's
still an arm missing.

00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:42.136
But now that he's out,
how do we get him back to your‐‐

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:54.816
[cicadas crying]

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:04.534
[cicadas crying]

00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:06.202
Hey, Rena?

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:07.120
[RENA]
Oh, wow!

00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:10.081
Sorry, I just noticed something
really cool over there.

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:10.873
[KEIICHI]
Hm?

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.542
[RENA]
We gotta move Kenta‐<i>kun</i>!

00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:14.335
[KEIICHI]
Uh. Yeah, I agree.

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:16.004
[RENA]
I'll go grab something!

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:34.731
All right, we should
probably get a move on.

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:36.441
It's starting to get dark out.

00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:38.359
Great. Let's go!

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.865
[SATOKO] So you got to
visit Rena's home, did you?

00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:45.241
[laughs]

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:46.659
So what did you think?

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:48.244
[SATOKO]
There's nothing quite like it.

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.580
But it's just a house, right?

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:51.914
[KEIICHI]
Hmmm...

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:53.207
I guess so.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:54.834
It's pretty normal,
if you don't count

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:57.837
the store mascot statues
all over the place.

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.047
And, you like cute things,

00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:01.466
so it would make sense
you'd have all that stuff.

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:05.678
But I need an explanation
for the mailbox!

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.431
I just thought it was cute
how big and red it was!

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:10.391
Awoo...

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:11.934
I'm back, everyone.

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:17.440
Hey, Rika, what'd you do to
get on the principal's bad side?

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.692
Bite your tongue.
Don't slander Rika

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:22.362
by implying she's a criminal
in training like you.

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:25.948
Oh. It's because Rika needed
to help out with Watanagashi.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.283
What's that again?

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:28.785
We've talked about it!

00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:31.954
It's a local festival that's
coming up here soon.

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:33.706
Yeah, that does ring a bell.

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:34.957
[RIKA]
The people here show gratitude

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:36.000
to their worn‐out futons

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.710
by shredding up
their cotton stuffing

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:39.629
and sending it down the river.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.713
[KEIICHI]
Hmmm...

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:42.840
Doesn't sound like
a good time to me.

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.926
Then you're in
for a big surprise!

00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:46.052
Our main event.

00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:48.262
It's the Four‐Demon
Battle Royale!

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.139
Well the name's
interesting at least.

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:51.057
Now that we have Keiichi,

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.851
we need to make it a Five‐Demon
Battle Royale, though.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.520
[laughs]

00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:57.688
This challenge will
be the perfect chance

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.066
for you to put everything
we've taught you into practice!

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:00.817
That's right!

00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:03.027
We'll be making the rounds
through the festival stalls

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:05.863
and playing club games.

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.323
Is that so?

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:09.909
Now I'm getting
kind of excited too!

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:15.039
Huh? Keiichi!

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.500
How's everything been?

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:18.835
Hello there.

00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:20.795
Oh! Heya, Tomitake.

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:22.380
Get any good shots today?

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:24.090
Sure. At least a few.

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:26.342
[chuckles]

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:27.718
You know him?

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.303
Well, we've met, sure.

00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:30.972
Yeah, he shows up
pretty regularly

00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:32.515
to take pictures of birds.

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:34.016
I'd say just about
everybody here

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:36.394
in Hinamizawa knows who he is.

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:37.228
So then.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.439
You gonna be joining us
for Watanagashi?

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.149
Oh, yeah, I thought
it would be fun

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.776
to take in the festival
before I head back to Tokyo.

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:46.154
I hope you get your
own photo exhibit soon!

00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:47.155
You're too kind.

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:49.574
But hey, maybe someday. Y'know?

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:51.742
Well, anyway,

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:54.245
I'll be seeing you
guys at the festival!

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.206
Pictures of birds, huh?

00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:59.876
Is that really the only
reason he comes out here?

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:01.169
What do you mean?

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.795
Just a hunch,

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:05.715
but I feel like there might
be a lot more going on.

00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:08.217
[MION]
Wow! Damn, this kid is sharp!

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:08.968
I knew it!

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.094
So what's the deal?

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.888
The birdwatching is a front.

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:15.349
He's in Hinamizawa looking
for a different kind of beauty.

00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:17.018
An eligible young lady.

00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:17.768
Huh?

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.103
[MION]
But he's kind of an awkward guy,

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.147
so I guess it's not
workin' out so good.

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:22.732
And, sometimes people
from the village

00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:25.151
will ask him to
take pictures for them.

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:26.569
Wait, that's it?

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.362
I feel bad. I mean,

00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:30.823
I was thinking something
way more sinister.

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:32.909
[MION]
Huh? Sinister how?

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.912
Not sure, it just feels
like he's hiding a lot.

00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:38.664
Almost like a spy or something.

00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:39.832
[laughs]

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.210
He gets all nervous
just talkin' to some kids!

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:43.794
How could he be a spy?

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.588
[laughs]

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.380
Yeah, you're right.

00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:49.800
When you put it that way,
it does seem a bit ridiculous.

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:03.523
Does Hinamizawa really
have this many people?

00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:05.650
Watanagashi is a big event.

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:08.611
And our goal is to hit up
every stall in the place.

00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:09.862
I'll give it my all!

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:13.699
Me too! Let's do it!

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:14.242
Lovely.

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:15.618
Now we're all here.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.369
Were you held up,

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.539
or does it simply amuse you to
make a young lady wait for you?

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:20.665
I would never.

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:23.584
Is this lady still here
or did she already take off?

00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:25.336
I beg your pardon!

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:26.921
[gasps]

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:28.881
Awoo!

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:31.759
Look at Rika!

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:33.803
Oh my gosh, she's so kyute.

00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:36.013
I wanna keep her! Awoo!

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:37.765
[RIKA]
A lovely evening to all of you,

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:40.101
and it's so nice to
see you here, Keiichi!

00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:40.893
Hey, Rika!

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:42.603
That look is perfect for you!

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:43.396
[RIKA]
Mii!

00:17:43.437 --> 00:17:44.981
Thank you very much!

00:17:45.022 --> 00:17:46.107
By the way,

00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:48.985
Rika has a major role
to play during the festival.

00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:50.861
So that's why she's dressed up.

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:53.573
But my part doesn't
happen until the end.

00:17:53.614 --> 00:17:56.158
We still have some time
to hang out before then.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.868
Well, we don't want
to waste any more of it

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.287
standing around here!

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:00.246
[RENA]
I agree.

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:01.747
Right. It's time!

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:04.667
Let the Watanagashi
Five‐Demon Battle Royale...

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.377
[ALL]
...begin!

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.760
[RIKA] There's no way it
could taste good like that.

00:18:21.225 --> 00:18:23.603
[RIKA] There's no way it
could taste good like that.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.316
There's no way it could
taste good like that.

00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:33.321
[shutter click]

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:34.280
Hey there, kids.

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.407
Looks like you're
having a good time.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.451
[laughs]

00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:40.995
Not that it isn't a
pleasure to see you here,

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:42.705
but I must point out
how rude it is

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:46.000
to be taking pictures of a lady
without asking her permission.

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:49.128
That's true, but he was
taking a picture of you.

00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:52.256
What's your schedule?

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:55.009
Were you gonna get a few
pictures of Rika's performance?

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:57.136
That was the plan, actually.

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:58.929
But something
came up last second.

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:01.307
[MION] Somebody's
lady friend is in town!

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:03.643
Don't get too bold,
buddy; there are kids here!

00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:04.894
[chuckles]

00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:06.228
Come on, now.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.564
But hey, next time
you're in Hinamizawa,

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:10.983
you should come out and
play a few games with the club!

00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:13.653
Yeah, I'll take you up on
that someday, I promise.

00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:15.404
Well, see ya later.

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:19.992
Wait.

00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:26.749
Did you need something, Rika?

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:33.756
Aren't you sweet? Thanks, Rika.

00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:43.391
I should also be on my way.

00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:44.725
My part is starting soon.

00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:47.687
[SATOKO] And we know you're
going to do it beautifully!

00:19:47.728 --> 00:19:50.356
Well, I suppose we should be
heading that way as well.

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:53.359
All right, let's go
watch Rika do her thing!

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:55.403
Hey, guys, where's Rena?

00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:58.030
Keiichi! Mion! Where are you?!

00:19:58.072 --> 00:19:59.365
Please help me!

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:01.575
How'd she end up over there?

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:02.284
I don't know,

00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:04.954
but it looks like you need
to go wrangle her in, buddy.

00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:07.915
I'd help except I've got
this one to deal with.

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:10.918
And how exactly do
I need to be "dealt with"?

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.589
Ow, ow, ow, stop it! My arm!

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:17.717
Uh... Wow.

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:18.843
Please, Keiichi!

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:20.469
I don't know where you‐‐

00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:22.888
Stick with me.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.725
Ah! Right. Uh...

00:20:28.102 --> 00:20:29.603
Now, let's go.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:52.168
Rena, Keiichi!
We're over here!

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:59.008
Did you two share a nice moment?

00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:00.259
Shut up.

00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:22.656
What is that thing?

00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:25.034
It's a ceremonial hoe.

00:21:58.359 --> 00:22:00.194
Sorry I kept you waiting.

00:22:16.794 --> 00:22:18.128
Hi, Jiro.

00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:56.143
[RIKA] Next time,
<i>Onidamashi‐hen</i>, Part 3.
