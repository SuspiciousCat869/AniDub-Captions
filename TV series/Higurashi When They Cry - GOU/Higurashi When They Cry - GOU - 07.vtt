WEBVTT

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:20.062
Can't see.

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:22.731
Hmm? This the light?

00:00:22.773 --> 00:00:24.274
No, wait!

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.259
[SHION]
Leave 'em off, Kei.

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:15.677
What if somebody at the festival

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.554
looks our way and
sees the lights?

00:02:17.596 --> 00:02:19.389
Oh, right. Sorry.

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:21.016
[TAKANO]
I wouldn't worry.

00:02:21.058 --> 00:02:23.226
Everyone there is watching
Rika's dance right now,

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:25.646
so I don't think
they'll notice us.

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:28.106
This is the guardian deity
of Hinamizawa.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:29.566
Lord Oyashiro.

00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:30.692
[KEIICHI]
So that's him?

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:31.902
[SHION]
But it's much more ornate

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:33.570
than the one at the shrine.

00:02:33.612 --> 00:02:35.405
[TAKANO] The tools are
about what I expected,

00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:38.283
but I never thought that there
would be so many of them!

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:39.660
[KEIICHI]
What you expected?

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:42.245
These religious relics look
more like construction tools.

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:43.622
[TAKANO chuckles]

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:46.667
You might not quite
understand, Mister Maebara.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.335
Oh. Okay?

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:50.629
Let me enlighten you.

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:54.299
Perhaps this old folk story
will clarify things a bit.

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:58.845
[TAKANO] Long, long ago,
hidden among the mountains,

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:00.639
there was a swamp so deep,

00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:02.391
the people of the
nearby village believed

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:05.268
the bottom lay in
the depths of hell itself.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.270
They called it Onigafuchi.

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:08.480
Hold on.

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:12.651
So that nearby village
was Hinamizawa, right?

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:14.903
What a smart boy you are.

00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:16.279
Onigafuchi.

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.657
"The Demon's abyss"
is a pretty ominous name.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:19.866
From what I could find,

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:23.036
they changed the village's
name during the Meiji era.

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:25.414
[TAKANO] One day, it's said,
a horde of demons rose

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:28.333
from deep in the swamp
and invaded the village.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.544
Slaughtering the
people without mercy.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:33.004
The villagers tried
in vain to escape,

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.800
but they could neither flee
nor fight, only cower and hide.

00:03:36.842 --> 00:03:38.802
At last, when
they'd all but given up.

00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:42.764
Lord Oyashiro, their guardian
god, descended unto them.

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:45.142
So that's it. Lemme guess.

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:47.144
Oyashiro swoops
down from the heavens,

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.229
slays all the demons
and saves the day?

00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:51.273
Such a boyish
way of looking at life.

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:54.276
Not every problem can be
solved by slaying things, Kei.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.278
[TAKANO] And Lord Oyashiro
is the furthest thing

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.863
from a violent deity.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.448
He's a perfect guardian.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.451
A kind and benevolent god.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.745
In fact, his loving
nature was so strong

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:07.622
that even the demons
couldn't resist its radiance.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.542
They prostrated themselves
before Lord Oyashiro,

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.544
and he rewarded them
with human forms,

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:15.464
allowing them to live
in harmony with the villagers.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:18.258
Over the course of generations,
the humans and demons

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.635
intermingled
and their blood mixed.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:23.472
So the village carried
on existing in secret,

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:24.931
and the people at
the foot of the mountain

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:27.350
worshipped the
villagers as gods.

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.436
Man, that is one weird story.

00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:30.270
[TAKANO chuckles]

00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:34.274
Oh, indeed! But that
was just the prologue.

00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:36.735
Then, things got
really interesting.

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:39.654
You see, the demons
of Onigafuchi Swamp.

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:40.489
They were man‐eaters

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.367
who had originally attacked
the village in search of food.

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.786
Even in their human bodies,

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:49.080
the blood they passed down
was still demonic.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.624
It's only natural
that the villagers

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:55.045
with demon blood also hungered
for the flesh of humans, right?

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:55.712
Soon after,

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:59.007
the people of other nearby
villages started disappearing.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:01.468
It was said they'd
been demoned away.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.803
Demoned away?

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:05.430
A convenient place
to put the blame.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.140
It was really a
series of kidnappings

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:09.184
by the people of Onigafuchi.

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:11.895
Snatching up outsiders
to be sacrificed.

00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:12.771
[KEIICHI]
How's that different

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:14.272
from what the
demons did to them?

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.316
Where was their kind,
benevolent god?

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:17.484
Heh!

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:20.737
Lord Oyashiro was perfectly
aware of this practice.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.405
The villagers
didn't simply kidnap

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.533
whomever they happened across.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:25.700
They would only take those

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:28.912
whom Lord Oyashiro had
deemed worthy sacrifices.

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:32.249
And once those unfortunate
subjects had been procured,

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.417
the villagers would set
about preparing their feast

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:35.710
for the hideous ritual

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.129
that would become known
as "Watanagashi."

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.590
Watanagashi?

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:42.717
But they named the village's
end‐of‐winter festival

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.471
"Watanagashi" after the cotton
drifting ritual, didn't they?

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.014
Think, Kei.

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:51.726
That first part,
"Wata." can mean "guts."

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.103
[gasps]

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:54.271
That's true.

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:55.647
Now that I think about it.

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.858
I've heard
fish guts called that.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.150
[gasps]

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.819
But then, that means.

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:01.862
[TAKANO]
Oh yes.

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:04.447
I can see those gears
turning, Mister Maebara.

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:05.574
Huh?

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:06.950
[TAKANO]
Watanagashi as we know it

00:06:06.992 --> 00:06:09.619
is an early summer
festival held in June,

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:12.372
where villagers drift futon
stuffing down the river,

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.040
but not back then.

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:15.458
It was a long night of terror

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.627
for the people of
these mountains.

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.963
As they wondered who
Hinamizawa's villagers

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:21.882
would take for their meal.

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:25.093
You liar!

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.178
Setting cotton pieces adrift.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.931
There has to be another
meaning, doesn't there?

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.975
[KEIICHI]
Who the hell says?

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.768
A futon's a futon!

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.272
But for argument's sake, let's
assume it serves as a symbol.

00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:38.189
If that were true,

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:41.151
what would Rika really
be doing in her dance?

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:44.154
[gasps]

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:45.697
How would I know?

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:46.531
Come on.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:49.200
I haven't seen it because
I came out here instead!

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.452
Shhh!

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:54.497
Easy, Kei. No need to get upset.

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.666
[TAKANO]
The hoe Rika uses for her dance.

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:58.460
The one with the ornate blade.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:00.128
Huh?!

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.465
I had figured all of these
were just weird farm tools.

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:06.551
You mean they're
for chopping up people?

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:09.054
[TAKANO] More precisely,
they're for butchering people.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.932
These are all utensils
built for food preparation.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.225
[laughs]

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.435
Ms. Takano.

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:17.646
This is the first
he's heard of this.

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:19.731
Please give Kei a little time.

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:20.857
[TAKANO]
Apologies.

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.233
I truly thought boys your age

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:25.445
tended to like gruesome
horror stories like this one.

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:26.988
[sighs]

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.710
Jeez, Shion, be careful!

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:42.379
[SHION]
I swear, that wasn't my fault!

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.964
I barely even touched it!

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:46.174
Settle down, now, children.

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:50.804
Uh.

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:53.223
So, is everything okay in here?

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.643
Well, it doesn't appear
to be a fresh break,

00:07:56.685 --> 00:08:00.146
so I would say you're off the
hook for that this time, Shion.

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.657
[sighs]

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.283
This should be all right.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.411
Now, Jiro,
don't tell me you came in

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.705
out of concern
and not curiosity.

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.290
[TOMITAKE laughs]
Sorry, but it's true.

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.459
Part of me was screaming,
"Don't do it!"

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.462
Anyway, everyone's making
their way to the river.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:25.922
That's bad.

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:28.550
I would like to get
some pictures of all this.

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:31.052
Would you please
wait outside for me?

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:32.804
What will you two do now?

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:35.765
Yeah, I think I've seen enough.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:39.185
[TOMITAKE]
So?

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.395
Pretty interesting, right?

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:41.354
[KEIICHI]
If I could do it over,

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.398
I would've stayed here
and kept watch with you.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.983
[TOMITAKE laughs]

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:47.861
Did Ms. Takano manage
to keep her composure in there?

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:49.404
Well, I would be surprised.

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:52.157
In her eyes, those tools
are like hidden treasure.

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:53.241
[SHION laughs]

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:56.036
Yes, her excitement
was hard to miss.

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:57.203
[TAKANO]
Thanks for waiting.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:09:00.415
My curiosity is
thoroughly satisfied.

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:03.209
And what I've seen casts all
those old stories and legends

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:04.711
in a whole new light.

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:05.670
[TOMITAKE]
Ms. Takano.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:06.171
Huh?

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.881
[TOMITAKE] You didn't
take anything, did you?

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.340
[TAKANO]
I would never!

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:12.677
Surely you don't think
I'm that much of a child.

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:16.014
That's dealt with.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:17.849
Now we should
probably start making

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.517
our way back down to the river.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.685
It would be a real waste to come

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:24.314
to the cotton drifting festival
just to miss the main event.

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:28.234
Floating guts
down the river, huh?

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.618
[TOMITAKE]
Well, damn.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:39.079
All the best shots of
the night happened down there

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.789
while we were up here.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.625
Hey, the night's
not over yet, is it?

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:46.586
You can take my picture,
down by the riverside.

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.379
Right. Okay.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.049
Hey guys, we're gonna
head down to the riverside.

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.343
Would you care to join us?

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:56.096
No, thanks.

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.348
I'm sure you two would like
some time to yourselves.

00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:00.391
Have a good evening.

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:04.646
I think we might be
the ones imposing on them.

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:06.648
Shall we go, then, Jiro?

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:08.274
[TOMITAKE]
Mm.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:10.151
Have a good night.

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:15.865
[SHION yawns]

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.327
I am exhausted.

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:21.412
Same here.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.539
[SHION]
My sister and your friends

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.249
are probably looking for you.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.667
You should go find them.

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:27.669
Yeah. I'll do that.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.504
If Mion knew we were
running around together

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:33.133
the entire night,
she'd freak out on me.

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:35.969
So let's keep all of
this between us, okay?

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.972
Man, it feels weird when
you talk about it like that.

00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:41.015
[SHION] I don't just mean
that you were with me.

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.016
Huh?

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:44.853
You and I were both
breaking the rules tonight.

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:47.772
We have to keep
quiet about all of it.

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:53.319
This is the night
of the festival.

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:56.322
Lord Oyashiro's watching.

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:57.824
After what we did,

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:00.451
the four of us should hope
he's not looking our way.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:01.870
[gasps]

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:06.207
Heh, come on.

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:07.542
It was a joke!

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:10.378
[laughs]

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.880
Yeah, you got me!

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:14.215
Just blame it on Takano
and her creepy stories.

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.009
She honestly got me freaked out.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.261
[SHION]
Well... Mion might be here soon.

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:20.054
See you around, Kei!

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:32.859
[RIKA]
Keiichi! We found you!

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.652
Oh. It's you, Rika.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.362
What's going on?

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.198
Tracked ya down at last!

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:39.574
That just leaves Satoko.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:43.369
I guess everybody got
split up tonight! Awooo...

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.121
Were you watching
my dance, Keiichi?

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:47.373
It was hard to see
the faces in the crowd.

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:49.000
Huh? Oh, yeah!

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:50.668
Watched the whole thing,

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.503
and I thought you
did a great job!

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:54.255
No mistakes at all!

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.426
Mii...

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.386
See, I told you
nobody in the crowd

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:03.473
would think you'd gotten
anything wrong, Rika!

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:05.850
[MION]
What about after that?

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:08.144
Were you able to
drift some cotton, Kei?

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:09.562
Oh, no.

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:12.232
[RENA] Wait, did you never
make it down to the river?

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:15.109
We gotta go right now,
Keiichi, it's almost over.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.653
It's almost over!

00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:18.363
Sorry, guys, my bad.

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:20.531
I've never done all this before.

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:23.618
I don't really know
the rules too well yet.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:29.040
Yeah, that's fair.
Sorry. Let's go.

00:12:41.844 --> 00:12:43.429
Kei, listen.

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:44.639
What's up?

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:47.350
[MION]
Have you seen Shion tonight?

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:48.977
Nope. Not once!

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:51.604
No, wait, I might've
seen her at some point,

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:54.524
but it was in the crowd
from pretty far away.

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:56.359
It might've been you, actually.

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:58.152
[MION]
We don't look exactly alike.

00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:00.154
We don't even wear
the same clothes.

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:03.908
[KEIICHI]
Eh. Okay, that's a fair point.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:07.912
[MION] So... you haven't seen
Takano or Tomitake either?

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:09.163
[gasps]

00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:13.334
Eh. Uh...

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:16.004
Not at all. Neither one of 'em.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.098
[car horn honks]

00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:36.441
Hey.

00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:39.694
Sorry about holding
you up like this.

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.155
What can I do
for you, Detective?

00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:43.948
No need to make that face.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.700
I just happened
to see you walking by

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:48.077
and wondered if you might
have any interesting information

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:49.996
you'd like to share with me.

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:50.872
Okay.

00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:52.999
Though first, I've gotta say,

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:55.918
it's genuinely impressive how
quickly you seem to have gotten

00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.798
in good with those Sonozaki
sisters, Mister Maebara.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.216
Thank you, I guess?

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:03.843
[OOISHI]
You hear about their dad?

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:06.512
See, the Sonozaki clan
has run things around here

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:08.348
for quite some time now.

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:10.641
Those two are the
big boss's daughters.

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:11.434
What?

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.519
[OOISHI] Sorry,
I thought you already knew.

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:14.854
Dunno if you've
seen their house,

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:18.149
but it looks like something
straight out of a Yakuza movie.

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:22.403
High fences, barbed wire,
security cameras, the works.

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:23.905
[KEIICHI]
So what.

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:26.491
Is Mion the next head
of the family or something?

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:29.410
Yeah. She's set
to take the throne.

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:31.287
She could cut someone's
throat in broad daylight

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:34.248
and nobody outside of
town would ever hear of it.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.833
She wouldn't kill anyone!

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.210
[OOISHI laughs]

00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:38.920
Just giving an example.

00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:41.089
I don't care about
her family's reputation.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.841
Mion's always had my back
since I moved out here.

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:45.343
So if that's all you've got.

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:47.136
I'm gonna go home.

00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:50.223
Mister Maebara.

00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:51.682
I'll be happy to let you go

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:53.893
if you'll answer this
one question for me.

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:54.977
What's that?

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:56.354
Any chance you
would've crossed paths

00:14:56.396 --> 00:15:00.608
with Jiro Tomitake and Miyo
Takano at some point tonight?

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:01.818
Huh?!

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:04.237
Not sure. Why do you ask?

00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:07.740
Really? Not sure if
you've seen them or not?

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:10.785
Yeah. Sorry.

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:13.121
[indistinct radio chatter]

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:16.457
[OOISHI]
Hmm... Well, that's that.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:17.583
I suppose there's no point

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:21.796
in keeping you here
any longer, is there?

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:25.550
Oh. One quick thing
before you head home:

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:28.594
I already know you saw 'em
both earlier tonight.

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:30.721
You and Shion snuck away
from the crowds

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:33.474
and had your own little
get‐together with those two.

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:34.934
By the big stone steps.

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:36.519
[gasps]

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:39.021
See you around, Mister Maebara.

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:46.028
[KEIICHI]
Why're you calling me so late?

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.905
[SHION]
I was worried whether my sister

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.991
actually bought your story.

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:52.660
She seemed to realize
pretty quick that I was lying

00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:54.912
when I told Rika
I'd been watching her dance,

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:56.789
but I think
she believed the rest.

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:59.208
[SHION laughs]
You're such a good boy.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.877
Oh, shut up, Shion.

00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:02.545
[SHION]
Also, um,

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:05.089
there was one more thing
I wanted to ask you about.

00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:07.633
What's that?

00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:11.512
[SHION] So, at the
Watanagashi festival tonight,

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:15.850
the four of us all went inside
that storehouse, didn't we?

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:18.352
Then we walked down
to the stone steps.

00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:21.689
We all parted ways at
that point, if I recall.

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:24.859
Yeah. Why're you asking?

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.277
[SHION]
After that,

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:30.448
did you see Takano
or Tomitake at all?

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.574
What happened?

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:34.285
Why does everyone
keep asking about them?

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.704
What about you, do you
know where they went?

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:39.707
[SHION]
Easy, Kei! Listen.

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:42.376
Those two have gone missing.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.004
I was worried that
the curse would strike tonight,

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:47.340
and those two
would be the victims.

00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:48.799
[KEIICHI]
What?

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:50.635
[SHION] The Sonozaki family
keeps close tabs

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:53.137
on police activity here.

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:54.722
From what we've been told,

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:57.934
they were most recently seen
in the volunteer parking lot.

00:16:57.975 --> 00:17:00.269
Apparently, they took one of
the festival's mini‐trucks

00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:01.771
and sped off.

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:04.565
Her car and his bike
are still out there.

00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:07.068
It doesn't seem like they
planned this ahead of time.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:08.694
Considering how much
of a hurry they were in

00:17:08.736 --> 00:17:10.238
to get out of the village,

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:13.032
the police are assuming
they feared for their lives.

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:15.535
[KEIICHI]
What's that supposed to mean?

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:17.912
[SHION] It means they
may have been targeted

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:20.957
by Lord Oyashiro's curse.

00:17:20.998 --> 00:17:25.127
And if that's what happened,
then you and I know why.

00:17:25.169 --> 00:17:27.129
They encroached
on sacred ground,

00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:31.008
and then they desecrated an
image of Lord Oyashiro himself.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:35.596
Wait. So then,
does that mean we're next?

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:36.389
[SHION]
Yes.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.473
[KEIICHI]
But why?

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:38.766
I mean of course it
was wrong of us

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:42.144
to trespass in the first place,
but we just looked!

00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:44.730
Plus I didn't even wanna
see that crap to begin with!

00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:46.357
That whole thing sucked!

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:49.694
I even told you going in there
seemed like a terrible idea!

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:53.447
All I wanted was to find a
spot where we could watch Rika!

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:54.574
But not you!

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:56.659
You dragged me into
that stupid storehouse

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:58.077
on the night of Watanagashi!

00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:00.538
Now you call me in the
middle of the night for what?!

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.748
To tell me that
we're both screwed?!

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.958
[SHION]
I'm sorry.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.210
I never expected it
to happen this way.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:08.212
You were the one
who made it happen!

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:09.422
So what now?!

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:11.007
Fix this!

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:13.926
You messed it up,
so you need to fix it, right?!

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:15.011
Answer me!

00:18:15.052 --> 00:18:17.847
[phone click]

00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:22.935
No way.

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:26.564
So the curse is really
gonna come after us now?

00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:37.658
Shion.

00:18:41.412 --> 00:18:44.665
[RENA]
Hey! Morning, Keiichi!

00:18:45.708 --> 00:18:47.335
Oh gosh, are you okay?

00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:49.920
You've got bags under your eyes.

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:53.341
Yeah, I'm fine,
just had a rough night.

00:18:57.762 --> 00:19:01.432
[RENA] You must've had too
much fun at the festival, huh?

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:03.768
Hey.

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:05.394
Good morning, Mion!

00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:08.856
Uh‐oh. Did you manage to get
enough sleep after the festival?

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:09.690
Did you?

00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:10.608
[MION]
Nnn...

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.818
I didn't get to bed
until around three.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.694
I'm beat.

00:19:13.736 --> 00:19:17.573
[KEIICHI] Three? Dude,
why would you stay up that late?

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:23.913
Does that mean that the mayor
still hasn't turned up yet?

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:25.456
[KEIICHI]
Hey, hold on a second.

00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:29.585
[KEIICHI]
What are you talking about?

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:31.754
[CHIE] Though
I'm sure at least some of you

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:33.923
have been told
about this already.

00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:35.675
Mayor Kimiyoshi has gone missing

00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:38.552
and hasn't been heard
from since yesterday.

00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:39.637
The demons.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:42.390
But it doesn't seem like
the curse happened this year.

00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:45.059
[CHIE] If anybody here sees
the mayor somewhere around,

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:47.395
hurry and tell an
adult right away, okay?

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:49.230
And none of you
should walk home alone!

00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:51.065
Everyone buddy up!

00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:53.943
[GIRL A]
Heads up!

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:57.196
Why was it the mayor?

00:19:57.238 --> 00:20:01.951
If the demons did it,
wouldn't they take me or Shion?

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:03.494
[RIKA]
Keiichi!

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:06.372
Is there a reason
you look so sad today?

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:07.373
Rika?

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:08.791
Please tell the truth.

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:13.295
Last night,
did you do something bad?

00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:18.718
Keiichi, do you not remember
what happened last night?

00:20:20.678 --> 00:20:24.348
Rika. You wanna
hear a kitty story?

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.643
Kitty story? Meow does it go?

00:20:27.685 --> 00:20:29.895
One time, there were
four naughty kitties

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:31.564
hanging out at a shrine.

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:33.315
They snuck into
a sacred storehouse

00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:36.736
on the night of a festival
when nobody was keeping guard.

00:20:36.777 --> 00:20:40.906
But then, they all got scared
when they saw what was inside.

00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:44.285
Then, they heard they might
be cursed just for looking.

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:47.955
Later, two of those kitties
disappeared in the night.

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:51.834
So please, Rika.
The two that're left.

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:54.253
What can they do now?

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:57.214
[RIKA laughs]

00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:59.592
Why would you bother
with that flimsy pretext

00:20:59.633 --> 00:21:02.762
when you're clearly
dying to confess?

00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:03.804
[gasps]

00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:05.222
[RIKA]
It's not an issue.

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:08.434
You have absolutely
nothing to worry about.

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:11.645
If only you'd thought
to worry a little bit sooner,

00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:13.898
maybe it wouldn't
have come to this.

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:15.608
But the curse this year.

00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:16.817
Your whole world.

00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:19.236
You've already
thrown everything away.

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:22.615
Do you understand you
could have avoided all this

00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:25.034
if you'd just stayed
and watched me dance?

00:21:25.075 --> 00:21:27.203
But instead, you snuck off
to the toolshed.

00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:29.622
Violated a sacred space.

00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:32.291
On the night of
Watanagashi, at that.

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:34.752
How could you know?

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:35.920
[RIKA]
Usually they would have

00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:38.464
already found Tomitake's
body by this point.

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:41.801
But yes, he and Takano are dead.

00:21:41.842 --> 00:21:45.346
Not Shion.
She should still be alive.

00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:48.015
Wait, what are
you even saying, Rika?

00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:48.891
[RIKA]
And right now,

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:51.769
what happens to you
is anybody's guess.

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:53.646
I hope you like surprises.

00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:56.232
[laughs]

00:21:57.858 --> 00:21:58.859
Hey, Keiichi!

00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:01.195
There's always better things
to do than sit around.

00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:02.738
Grab the ball that just hit you.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.740
You can come join our game.

00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:06.659
Time for super deadly
sludge 'n' slaughter

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.204
electric razor wire
trench warfare dodgeball!

00:22:10.246 --> 00:22:11.163
I guess.

00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:12.331
[RIKA]
Keiichi?

00:22:16.502 --> 00:22:18.212
Why don't you play with Satoko?

00:23:52.932 --> 00:23:56.143
Next time:
<i>Watadamashi‐hen</i>, Part 4.
