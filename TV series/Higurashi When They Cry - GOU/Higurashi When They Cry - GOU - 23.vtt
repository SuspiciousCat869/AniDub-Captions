00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:16.642
[MION]
Okay, guys!

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:17.684
Listen up!

00:00:17.768 --> 00:00:19.895
Looks like we've got
15 players here.

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.481
We'll split into five groups
of three by drawing numbers,

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.651
and the winner from each group
will move on to the final round.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.362
[KEIICHI]
What's up, Satoko?

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.697
You getting bored with
the tournament already?

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:31.782
Beg your pardon,

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.700
but what makes you
think I'm bored?

00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:35.410
Just seems like you've
been kinda staring off

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:37.162
into space all morning.

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:40.207
Well, we've done exactly
the same thing in club before.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.376
I suppose I was
having a bit of déjà vu.

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:44.962
[KEIICHI]
You've done this before?

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.215
It's new to me, so of course
I'm still excited about it.

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.717
Plus, even if the tournament
itself is the same,

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:52.302
the games and
players are random,

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:53.512
and if you don't know
what you're playing

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:54.596
or who you're playing it with,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.431
you still won't
know what to expect!

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:59.184
Actually, I do know all that.

00:00:59.268 --> 00:01:00.269
Each of the five of us

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:02.813
will be playing
with a different group.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.607
My group will be
playing Concentration.

00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:08.652
You, Keiichi, are going to
be playing the Game of Life.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:09.778
A prophecy?

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:11.029
That seems more
like the kind of thing

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:13.115
Rika would normally say.

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:14.616
I suppose I may have
started picking up

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.368
old habits from her.

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:18.120
Although, I like to believe

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:19.580
I could find a
more entertaining way

00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:22.374
to exploit the ability
to see the future.

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.217
Now, here I go!

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:36.847
[GAMER A]
Wrong ca‐‐

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.516
[SATOKO]
Now, here I go!

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:41.727
[SATOKO laughs]

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.187
The ace of hearts is right here.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.565
How could she have guessed that?

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:48.900
Sorry to tell you,

00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:51.528
neither one of you will be
flipping over a single card!

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.630
[chortles]

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:13.383
Good game, boys,
but victory is mine!

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.093
What are you, psychic?

00:02:15.177 --> 00:02:17.763
[SATOKO chuckles]
Not in the least!

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:20.432
I simply lured you into a trap.

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:21.975
Before the game even started.

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.936
I already knew the location
of every single card!

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.855
A flawless victory
in record time.

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:28.190
That's some nice work!

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:30.651
What else would we expect
from our rising star?

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:32.819
That was incredible, Satoko!

00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:34.321
After the tournament is over,

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:37.115
I hope I can talk you into
letting me in on your secret!

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:38.200
Really?

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.369
I thought you'd
come by it naturally!

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:42.621
[laughs]

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.139
You're quite resourceful.

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:28.268
Moreso than the
cat by a wide margin.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.395
But of course, our
ways of approaching problems

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:31.730
differ significantly.

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:34.357
My methods are
far more reliable.

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:35.567
[???]
Go on.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.652
[SATOKO] If we think
of it as a dice game,

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:40.864
Rika is the sort to rely on
her luck and personal charm

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.491
to sway the table her way.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:44.743
Whereas I prefer
to take direct action

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:47.913
and make certain that
the dice lands in my favor.

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:50.081
In this world, where
I have access to the table

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:51.958
and unlimited time to prepare.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:53.502
I can tilt the
playing field to a point

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:56.463
where Rika's luck and charm
will never come into play.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:58.465
[??? chuckles]

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.760
[SATOKO] Unrelatedly, it can
be quite difficult to converse

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:04.054
with somebody whose
name you don't know.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.138
I see no reason why

00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:06.640
you shouldn't be willing
to share yours,

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.059
given how long
we've been at this.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.604
[???]
I have none to share.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:14.105
I am without a name,

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.691
for indeed, who was
there to give me one?

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:20.695
I alighted on this fragment
only upon your touch.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.073
But now, we are both here!

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.826
And so, you may grant me
a name as you see fit.

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:26.701
What?

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:27.994
As I see fit?

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.704
That's rather bold of you.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:30.580
Well?

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:32.624
What am I to be called, then?

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:37.128
[SATOKO]
Let's see... Eh... Ooh... Uh...

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:40.257
[??? laughs]
Very good!

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.092
[SATOKO]
But I haven't said anything!

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.553
[??? chuckles]
Your heart spoke aloud,

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:46.429
and it said what
I knew it would.

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:49.766
And so, I shall
hereafter be called "Eua."

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.768
[SATOKO]
Wait. Those were just noises.

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:53.019
They weren't supposed to‐‐

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:56.773
[EUA laughs]

00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:58.441
[SATOKO]
Suit yourself.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:00.193
Moving on then, Eua.

00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:02.028
While going
through these fragments,

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:05.657
I noticed a strange phenomenon
I couldn't quite explain.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.702
Oh? I should like
to hear about that.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.495
It seems that on some occasions,

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:12.622
humans are able to
remember different lives,

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:16.334
lived by alternate versions of
themselves in other fragments.

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:18.920
How could I? How could I?

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:21.840
How could I have done
something so horrible?

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:24.509
I'm a monster!

00:06:24.593 --> 00:06:27.304
Keiichi, what could
that possibly mean?

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:28.972
I'm not sure either.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.765
Kei, I'm right here with you!

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.601
I'm alive and breathing, see?

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:37.480
You've started
remembering, right, Keiichi?

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:39.774
You remembered when you
killed Rena and Mion.

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.693
Yes! I killed them,
and it wasn't a dream!

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:43.236
I know it was real!

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.698
It was a world, not ours,
but exactly like it.

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:50.160
And somehow, suddenly,
I couldn't trust my friends.

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:52.454
And in the end, I killed you!

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:54.497
For trying to help me!

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:55.916
And I know you
were trying to help,

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:57.918
so why couldn't
I believe it then?

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.628
What's the matter with me?

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:02.881
[sobs]

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:04.966
And Keiichi wasn't
the only one affected.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.259
In fact,

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:08.178
Rena and Shion also
began feeling the effects

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.638
of some events they
had only gone through

00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:11.306
in other fragments.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.391
[EUA] Hmm.
So great is my power,

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:16.978
that the world cannot help
but be changed by its exercise.

00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:20.273
The use of this power causes
small changes in the fragments,

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:23.485
which accumulate over repeated
journeys through the loops.

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:27.447
The cat would often speak
of such changes as "miracles."

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.658
Then as I've continued to
loop through the fragments,

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:32.035
'I suppose I made it inevitable
that these strange events

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.204
would start happening
consistently.

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:37.082
[EUA] The accumulation of
memories is irreversible.

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:39.292
Once a memory is
changed by your influence,

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:42.295
that change shall not wane
through any number of loops,

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:44.339
and so, the effects
of your influence

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.633
grow stronger
with each new life.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:48.843
Which means, the ones
who are most affected

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:52.347
by the influence of a looper,
are those closest to them?

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.100
As one would expect,
for was it not the strength

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:56.351
of your ties to the cat

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:59.938
that brought us together
in this place?

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.231
And if that's the case,

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.941
one would think the
looper's direct relatives

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:04.901
might be affected as well.

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:07.946
[EUA]
Indeed, it only makes sense.

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:12.909
[SATOKO] But to me,
nothing could make less sense.

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:18.164
Yes, he's lived here
for some time,

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:19.582
but you might
have been able to guess

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.127
that he wasn't quite
the neighborly type.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.461
We'd received some complaints

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:26.673
about the smell of garbage
coming from this unit,

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:28.758
but since the heat wave
hit a few days ago,

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:31.594
I can barely walk past
without getting sick.

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:38.143

no one to find him.

[POLICEMAN B] Hurry up
and get yourself a wife, son.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.272
Live this life
alone for too long,

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.691
and your body
starts breakin' down.

In the end, no one finds you
till you stink too bad to miss.

[POLICEMAN A] I think I'm
okay for a few more years.

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:52.741
[POLICEMAN B]
Look here.

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:54.617
He was ripping up his flooring.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.286
He must have had
a seizure so painful

00:08:56.369 --> 00:09:00.373
that he started clawing
at the tatami by reflex.

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:01.708
Then we show up days later

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.419
and follow the smell
of rot to find this.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:06.254

right, Satoko?

eh, Mister Hojo?

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:34.679

worrying about you,

why we're here?

if you'd let me deal
with this guy.

Mister Hojo, when they
told me why you were in here,

I was sure someone
had been pulling my leg.

I read the witness statements,
but I couldn't believe 'em.

Then Satoko said
the exact same thing.

00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:05.918

protect your darling niece

from the violent
delinquents threatening her.

but that's bullshit.

You're right.

I know all about you.

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:21.017
There's no way a thug like you
would pick a losing fight

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.685
unless someone paid ya.

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.770
But the other option
is you suddenly started

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:27.440
caring enough about your niece
to take a beating for her.

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:29.525
I don't know
which is less likely.

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:31.694

crappy mood, all right?

Whatever the case may be,

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:40.661
you'd better show
some gratitude to Satoko

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:41.954
when you see her.

00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:46.208
If she hadn't told us
that you were protecting her,

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:48.085
let's just say this
little reunion of ours

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:50.296
wouldn't have
gone this smoothly.

In fact, you wouldn't have
been leaving for quite a while.

[SATOKO]
What on Earth made you do that?

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:22.370
It wasn't anything,
like the Uncle I know.

00:19:22.453 --> 00:19:24.955
I saw it myself,
and I can barely believe it.

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:26.749
Me neither, honestly.

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:27.958
I never played the good guy,

00:19:28.042 --> 00:19:30.336
or even really thought about it.

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:33.005
So why did you decide
to do that for me?

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:35.716
It's all these dreams
I've been havin' lately.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.260
I get to watch my life
go to shit over and over,

00:19:38.344 --> 00:19:40.971
and it's a little
different every time.

00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:45.351
Haven't taken care of my body,
and it's fallin' apart.

00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:47.395
I just realized
I can either wind up dead

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.023
in an empty apartment,
or I can make a change.

00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:54.402
So you stepped in to protect me

00:19:54.485 --> 00:19:55.986
because you can't
afford a caretaker,

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.031
and I'm the closest thing you're
likely to get, is that right?

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:01.033
Hell, in the end, I guess it is.

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:04.578
I'm afraid that's
too much to ask.

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:06.455
I already knew that.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.624
You don't do the kinda shit
I did to my family,

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.961
then ask 'em to support you
when you're gettin' old.

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:14.130
Wouldn't be right.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.512
[TEPPEI] But now I wanna
start tryin' to make up

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:24.306
for all the pain I've caused.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.892
If nothin' else, I don't
wanna be a burden on anyone

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:29.520
in the time I got left.

00:20:29.603 --> 00:20:32.898
Although... Maybe...
If somehow you decide

00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:35.526
I might deserve
another chance, y'know,

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:37.737
for whatever reason.

00:20:40.698 --> 00:20:43.743
Maybe I could
come see you sometimes.

00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:46.662
We could have dinner
together or something.

00:20:50.541 --> 00:20:54.086
[SATOKO] Sorry, that's
still too much to ask.

I'm finished dealin'

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:57.298
with all those scumbags
I used to know.

00:20:57.381 --> 00:21:00.176
I won't raise my hand against
you as long as I live,

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:02.928
and that's a promise.

00:21:03.012 --> 00:21:05.181
So please, I realize
I don't have the right

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:06.807
to ask you to forgive me,

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:09.769
but I hope we can
at least stay in touch.

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:34.835
[gasps]

00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:46.263
Sorry about that.

00:21:46.347 --> 00:21:48.766
I'm not sure what the hell
I was expecting you to do

00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:50.768
when you saw my hand
coming towards you again,

00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:52.728
after everything I did before.

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:53.854
Huh?

00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:56.732
[TEPPEI]
You take care, Satoko.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.362
[TEPPEI] Maybe we could run into
each other again sometime, huh?

00:23:49.887 --> 00:23:53.349
