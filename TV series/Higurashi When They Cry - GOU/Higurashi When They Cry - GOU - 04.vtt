[AIKO] Keiichi!
Come on, time to get up!

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:52.547
You look awful!

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.174
Are you feeling all right?

00:02:54.216 --> 00:02:56.051
I think I have a fever.

00:02:56.093 --> 00:02:57.386
Might be a cold.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.262
Uh‐oh. Is it bad?

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:00.472
Can you do school today?

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:02.557
[doorbell dings]

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.559
Well, Rena's here.

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:08.480
She probably came to get you
since you were running late.

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.857
You need to get ready quick
if you're gonna go.

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.609
[KEIICHI]
Sorry, I don't think I am.

00:03:12.651 --> 00:03:14.361
That's fine. I'll go
ahead and tell her

00:03:14.403 --> 00:03:17.239
that she should head on
to school without you then.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.368
[AIKO]
Stop by the clinic later, okay?

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.703
Yeah.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.679
Um, excuse me, sir.

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:44.015
Oh, our apologies, but the
clinic is being remodeled.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.809
Huh? Is that so?

00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:48.228
And it'll be a while before
they're open again.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.231
You'll need to find
another clinic for now.

00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:53.024
Right. Thanks.

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.788
Not sure what other
clinic that'd be.

00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:14.463
Kei's here! Nice!
Glad ya didn't die!

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:17.591
Thanks. Not sure why you
sound so surprised, though.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:18.675
Rena comes in like,

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:21.303
"Keiichi's mom told me
he'd gotten really sick!

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.722
I'm so worried! Awoo!" Right?

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:26.183
Come on, that's not what I said!

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:28.810
Plus, how could I
not be worried about you?

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:32.147
Are you feeling
any better now, Keiichi?

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:33.356
Yeah.

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:34.983
You're astoundingly feeble.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:37.402
Even you shouldn't struggle
this hard with a cold.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.070
Morons don't catch colds.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.698
I bet you've
never had one, right?

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.824
Of course I haven't!

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:44.284
I would never
catch such a thing,

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:47.120
unlike a pathetic weakling
like you, dear Keiichi.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:48.705
Whether you're sick
or just need some help,

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:50.791
I'll be right here
for both of you!

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.918
I do not need help!

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:57.172
[RENA]
Oh yeah. Hey, Keiichi!

00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:58.715
Uh, Keiichi?

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.175
Yeah, sorry.

00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:02.219
I kinda spaced out
there for a sec.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.887
Must be the fever.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:08.975
Seriously. Are you
feelin' all right, Kei?

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:11.186
[KEIICHI] I'm not a hundred
percent, but I'm okay.

00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:12.395
Don't worry, guys.

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:13.980
[MION]
If you say so.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:16.983
I think we should probably
hold off on club, though.

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:22.197
[RIKA]
Keiichi?

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:25.617
Huh? Rika?

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:29.913
So, what's up?

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:33.250
I don't think I've ever seen you
without Satoko at lunch before.

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:34.084
I really wanted to have

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.753
this conversation
with you one‐on‐one.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:37.796
[KEIICHI]
Okay.

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:39.297
I've been wondering.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.632
Are you worried about anything,

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:43.301
or has there been something
bothering you lately?

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.640
[KEIICHI] Where'd that
come from all of a sudden?

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:50.934
[RIKA]
You can tell me.

00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:51.893
You're trying to hide it,

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:55.105
but I can tell something's got
you really worried, Keiichi.

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.816
[KEIICHI]
Rika.

00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:00.193
Can we talk about that?

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.072
It's Rena.

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:07.450
Lately she's just
been acting weird.

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:10.203
Did Rena say or do
anything to scare you?

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:11.580
[KEIICHI]
It's crazy, right?

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:14.624
She's a close friend, and I care
about her a lot, but...

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:16.710
...sometimes, she...

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.379
...she looks at me
with this dead stare,

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:22.716
and her eyes are so cold and
empty, and it does scare me.

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:24.384
"You liar."

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:25.844
If that's what
you're worried about,

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:30.056
it was just one moment, and
you shouldn't get hung up on it.

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:31.516
Maybe it hit you
harder than usual

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.602
'cause you were tired
when she said it.

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:35.312
Or maybe some anxiety of yours

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:38.648
is making things seem
worse than they are.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.692
Have you guys been lying
to me about anything

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:43.737
or keeping something
hidden from me?

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:46.114
Rena and Mion have
had my back since I got here,

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.116
but I still called
them both out.

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:49.618
You should try
to keep that in mind

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.371
if you ever find yourself
feeling scared of Rena again.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.290
So make sure it's not
actually your own troubles

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:57.959
that are making you worry, okay?

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.503
My own troubles, huh?

00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:07.761
Thanks for that, Rika.

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:10.013
It's exactly what
I needed to hear.

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:11.765
I know you can do it, Keiichi!

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.808
Stay strong and
keep your chin up!

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.268
Ni‐pa!

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:22.609
[KEIICHI]
I'm home.

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:30.241
Hey, Mom?

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:36.164
[KEIICHI]
And Dad's out too, huh?

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:48.259
So did something bad happen?

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.220
Out at the building site.

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:52.889
Like, you know,
an accident, maybe?

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:55.684
Rika really had
that figured out.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.769
Rena was originally from here.

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.229
Of course she
wouldn't wanna talk about

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.731
a murder that happened
in her hometown.

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:03.316
Why would she
have brought it up?

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:07.153
But I kept pressing anyway.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.531
It's not like she had
anything to do with it.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.117
I acted like I was
owed an explanation.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.077
It makes sense
she'd be uncomfortable.

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:15.203
Of course!

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:16.538
This has to be it!

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.331
And the other night when
she showed up at the house,

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:20.458
she wasn't eavesdropping on me.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.584
She must have come to my door,

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:24.462
then heard me on
the phone with Mister Ooishi,

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.965
and left because she
didn't wanna interrupt!

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.216
I imagined her standing there

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:29.759
peeking through
a crack in the door,

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:32.345
but by then she'd
already come and gone!

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:36.933
Shit!

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:48.778
[ringing]

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.863
Hello?

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:52.365
[AIKO]
Keiichi? Hey, it's Mom.

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:53.241
[KEIICHI]
What's up?

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:54.784
[AIKO]
Are you feeling better?

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.578
Did you go to the clinic?

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:57.996
[KEIICHI]
Oh yeah, I'm fine.

00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:00.540
[AIKO] That's good!
Your father and I had

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:02.834
some work‐related stuff
come up in Tokyo.

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:04.419
Sorry for the late notice,

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.921
but we found out
pretty late ourselves.

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:07.964
When is that?

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.758
[AIKO]
Oh, we're already here.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:10.717
Huh?

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:13.344
[AIKO] We won't be coming
home till tomorrow night.

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.721
Will you be okay?

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:16.890
[KEIICHI]
Yeah, I'm guessing I'll survive.

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:19.517
[AIKO] Food's already
taken care of, if that helps.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.603
Don't worry about
making your dinner.

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:22.687
What's that mean?

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.856
[AIKO] It means you've got a
home‐cooked meal on the way.

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:25.774
She should be there soon!

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:26.733
Who is she?

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.109
[AIKO]
Who do you think, silly?

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:30.111
Rena's coming!

00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:36.868

[RENA]
Hey, Keiichi?

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:07.816
Please open the door.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.692
Hey, Rena.

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:12.821
[RENA] Your mom called to tell
me she was going out of town.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.532
She asked me if I would
come and bring you dinner.

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:17.408
Oh. That's a surprise.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.744
She hadn't mentioned it to me.

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:22.831
[RENA] I made a lot so we
would have plenty to share,

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.499
so it's heavy.

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.251
Can I come in please?

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.503
Would you please let me in?

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.881
I really appreciate
you doing that.

00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:36.010
I just don't have much of an
appetite because of the fever.

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.595
[RENA]
But it's super yummy.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.597
And it's nutritious, too.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.307
It'll help you
get over your cold.

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:45.228
I know, your food
is always good.

Please don't tease me like this.

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:51.025
Let me in, Keiichi.

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:53.570
Please let me in?

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:57.031
Yeah. Of course.

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:00.952
She's my friend.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:04.038
Why do I still feel so unsure?

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:07.876
[RENA] Why are you being
so mean to me right now?

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.878
Why?

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.213
[KEIICHI]
Remember what Rika said before.

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:13.673
This is all in my head.

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:15.800
Rena would never
do anything to hurt me.

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:18.136
She's here to take care of me.

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:19.846
I can trust her!

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:32.567
[screams]

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:42.243
[gasps]
Rena?

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:43.995
I know you can do it, Keiichi!

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:46.080
Stay strong and
keep your chin up!

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:48.082
Ni‐pa!

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:55.173
It's okay.

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:08.311
[sighs]

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:11.731
I'm so glad you
finally opened your door!

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:16.486
Feeling better?

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:20.949
Hold on.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.700
Does that mean
you are feeling better,

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:25.078
or you're hungry, or, uh...

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.126
[RENA]
Thanks for having me.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:34.003
[KEIICHI]
Sure, make yourself at home.

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:36.214
Right now,
it's just me here anyway.

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:37.757
We're all alone?

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:42.887
I'm all alone
with Keiichi! Awoo!

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.765
So was all that food supposed
to be for just you and me?

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:47.934
Cuz that's more than
two people's worth.

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:50.645
[RENA giggles] I was just
really worried about you

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.814
not having enough
to eat, Keiichi.

00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:54.274
Well, I'm glad you came.

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:56.567
If it weren't for you, I'd be
eating a cup of noodles

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.194
instead of a nice
home‐cooked meal.

00:12:58.236 --> 00:12:59.696
[RENA]
I'll go get everything ready.

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:01.531
Can I unpack it
all in the kitchen?

00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:02.991
I can help with that.

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:04.993
It's fine. I'll take care of it.

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:08.246
You go relax and watch
TV until I'm done, 'kay?

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:10.081
If you say so.

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.457
The kitchen's there.

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:13.334
Help yourself to
whatever you need.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:15.086
Great, thank you!

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:21.217
[RANGER]
Long Sword!

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:24.554
Thank you!

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:25.930
[KEIICHI] You and
my mom must be better friends

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:29.434
than I realized if she would
ask you to do all this for me.

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:32.937
[RENA] Yeah. I guess we like
to shop at the same time

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:36.024
because we always run
into each other at the store.

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:39.444
[KEIICHI]
What store?

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.237
You mean the Seven Mart?

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.447
I go by there all the time,

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:44.824
but I don't think I've
ever seen you.

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:50.163
[RENA]
I've seen you there before,

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:52.582
but I didn't say
anything to you.

00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:53.750
You bought ramen.

00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:56.085
I think it was
ginger pork flavor.

00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:04.594
Wow, really?

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:05.636
Well, if you see me there again,

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:07.847
don't be afraid
to wave to me, okay?

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:09.057
Okay, next ques‐‐

00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:09.807
Do we have any clues

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:12.643
as to who killed and
dismembered the victim?

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:14.979
Dammit!

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.440
Hey. Since you're here,

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:20.026
I just wanna tell you
I'm sorry about the other day.

00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:22.362
[RENA]
What for? Sorry for what?

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:23.404
I know I was out of line,

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:26.699
and I said some things
I shouldn't have.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.285
It was wrong of me
to keep pushing

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:32.455
when it was obvious you weren't
comfortable talking about it.

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:34.499
I totally get why
you were upset.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.626
[RENA]
I don't know what you mean.

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:38.795
Back when we were
at the trash heap.

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.963
I brought up that murder.

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:46.511
[gasps]

00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:54.977
[RENA]
I have to keep Dad safe.

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:57.522
I have to protect my family.

00:14:57.563 --> 00:15:01.901
You'll be the one to die, and
I can be the one to disappear.

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:03.361
Yeah, perfect!

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:08.449
And then Lord Oyashiro's toll
will be paid until next year.

00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:10.034
You're talking crazy.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.370
Did you say...

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:14.205
...you're gonna...

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:18.668
I'll kill you,

00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:21.838
and the demons will come
and carry me off into the dark.

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:25.425
My dad will be able to go on
living his life here in peace.

00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:27.051
Yeah, that'd be best.

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.262
Best for everyone, right?

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:35.560
Stop!

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:39.021
[RENA] Because... Lord
Oyashiro's curse has claimed me.

00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:40.982
I can't be saved.

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:44.527
For a little while,
I thought I'd been forgiven,

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:47.155
but I was already too far gone.

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:48.156
It's done.

00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:50.158
Rena, please, don't come closer!

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:54.454
My soul belongs to Lord Oyashiro
now, and there can be no escape!

00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:56.038
[screams]

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:31.908
[KEIICHI]
Rena?

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.334
[screams]

00:16:47.798 --> 00:16:52.220
[laughs maniacally]

00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:21.601
[AIKO gasps]
Keiichi!

00:18:21.642 --> 00:18:24.895
[ICHIRO] Oh, thank God.
I'll go get the doctor!

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:25.896
Is she...?

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:28.816
It's okay, so please, just rest.

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:30.484
Is Rena still alive?

00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:32.778
Sweetie, you don't need
to think about that right now.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.280
[ICHIRO]
Doc, get in here.

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.115
Keiichi just woke up!

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:51.380
Good to see you, Mister Maebara.

00:18:51.422 --> 00:18:53.549
I hate to trouble you,
but if you're feeling up to it,

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:55.593
I was hoping
we could talk a bit.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.428
Sure, that's fine.

00:18:58.429 --> 00:19:01.599
[OOISHI] I'll try to keep
this as brief as I can.

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:04.435
I would like you tell me what
happened at your house that day,

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:06.395
to the best of your
recollection.

00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:09.440
[KEIICHI] Sorry.
I honestly don't think I can.

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:13.903
Do you mean it's hazy
in your memory, or, uh...

00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:15.821
It's perfectly clear.

00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:18.324
I can't get any of it
out of my head.

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.868
I remember how hitting her felt.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.872
[KEIICHI]
That's exactly it.

00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:28.709
I remember it all,
and it makes no sense.

00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:33.172
Even though I saw it all
happen, I just don't get it.

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:35.591
I have no idea why or how.

00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:43.015
[sobs]

00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:46.060
I'll be back.
Hang in there, kid.

00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:57.822
Hey, haven't seen you in years.

00:19:57.863 --> 00:20:00.157
How long has it been, Kei?

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:02.993
Longer than two days, wasn't it?

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:05.121
Yeah, this time it was.

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:10.418
I'm sorry it took me so long
to make it out here for a visit.

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:13.087
There's been a lot going on.

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.340
Mion, I have a question,

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:18.759
and I hope you can
give me an honest answer.

00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:20.094
[MION]
Sure.

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:22.471
What ended up happening to Rena?

00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:26.142
[KEIICHI]
My parents won't tell me.

00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:30.563
I keep asking, but everybody
refuses to say anything.

00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:33.816
In the end,
they couldn't save her.

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:36.152
It's a miracle they
could save you, Kei.

00:20:36.193 --> 00:20:38.404
We're so glad.

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:43.242
'Cause it wasn't just her.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:49.874
The next day, after the incident
at your house with you and Rena.

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:53.085
They found Rika and Satoko.

00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:55.379
What do you mean?
What happened?

00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:57.381
Their house on
the shrine grounds.

00:20:57.423 --> 00:21:00.384
Someone went there
to check up on them,

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:02.428
and they were both dead.

00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:05.890
They'd been killed
with the same knife.

00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:12.104
Multiple stab wounds
to their necks.

00:21:12.146 --> 00:21:14.190
[KEIICHI]
But they were just kids.

00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:15.691
Why would anybody do that?

00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:17.026
[MION]
We're not sure.

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:20.488
Police haven't determined if it
was murder or a double suicide.

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:22.072
[KEIICHI]
Suicide?

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.824
Why would they want
to kill themselves?

00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:25.242
[MION]
Yeah, exactly.

00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:27.661
It seems more likely that it
was a robbery gone wrong

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:29.705
or something like that.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.546
[NURSE] Mister Maebara,
it's time for a check‐in.

00:21:37.588 --> 00:21:39.924
[MION] Well, I should
get out of the way.

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.467
I'll be back soon.

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:43.761
[KEIICHI]
Thank you, Mion.

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:45.095
After everything
that's happened,

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:47.223
you gotta hang in
there, all right?

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.692
[NURSE]
Mister Maebara.

00:21:58.734 --> 00:21:59.610
Before we get started,

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:02.363
I'm going to need to ask
you about your symptoms.

00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:04.198
Symptoms?

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.157
For instance,

00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:08.202
have you been dealing
with itching around your throat?

00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:18.337
[KEIICHI screams]

00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:56.560
[RIKA] Next time,
<i>Watadamashi‐hen</i>, Part 1.
