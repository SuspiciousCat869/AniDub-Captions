00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:13.013
[TAKANO]
Now, pop quiz!

00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:15.224
Which of these
vegetables is green?

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:17.518
Broccoli, or cauliflower?

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:21.438
Caul‐‐ No. Broccoli?

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.028
That's correct.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.369
[laughs]

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.256
This is the part where
you kill me, right?

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:49.758
It is.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.218
I hope you're ready.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.940
Takano.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.276
If I had realized you were
out here with Tomitake,

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:33.028
I would have left you two alone!

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.572
I'll let you two
have your privacy.

00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:38.200
Ni‐paa!

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:41.828
[gasps]

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.169
Please forgive me...
for what I'm about to say.

00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:53.131
But why?
Why would you apologize?

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.758
[TOMITAKE] Takano got
caught up in something

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.052
very big and very dangerous.

00:02:57.094 --> 00:02:59.930
[TAKANO] Thank you for
defending me, but that's wrong.

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:01.765
I wasn't caught up in anything.

00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:05.018
I knew what was at stake,
and I made my choice.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.107
[RIKA]
Whatever you did.

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:12.984
I don't understand why you
decided to tell me about it.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.861
I've been pursuing
a personal agenda

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.613
that nearly
led me to sacrifice‐‐

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:17.656
Takano.

00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:19.282
It's fine.

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.368
This is the night
of Watanagashi.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.704
And I'm ready to
be rid of this sin.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:26.248
To lay it bare
and set it adrift.

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:33.714
You see, I intended
to kill you, Rika.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:37.676
My plan demanded sacrifices
that were never mine to make.

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:42.848
Your life. Your friends.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.766
I had no right!

00:03:46.852 --> 00:03:49.521
[RIKA]
To think you're apologizing.

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:53.859
Sorry, Rika, but she and I
really need to get out of here.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.027
[RIKA] So, what do you
two plan to do next?

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.989
Getting her out of
Hinamizawa is priority one.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.033
She's a key witness, and
this is all about to blow up.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.619
I won't allow anything
to happen to her.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:06.830
This won't end
in tragedy, right?

00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:08.874
Will you make that a promise?

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:09.750
[TOMITAKE]
Mm.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.209
I promise you.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.878
Now let's go.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.379
Okay.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.259
Takano.

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:22.345
I understand what
you planned to do,

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.055
but I don't understand
why you gave up

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.099
and confessed to it all.

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:28.226
I feel like I could have
known you for a hundred years

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.978
and never seen you
totally change your mind

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.522
on something like
this all of a sudden.

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:33.482
[TAKANO]
Hmph.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:34.733
I can't say.

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:36.401
Even if I tried to explain,

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:39.905
I don't think you'd
be able to understand.

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:56.254
[BLOODHOUND A]
Rika Furude?

00:04:58.381 --> 00:04:59.633
Satoko‐‐

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:02.093
[BLOODHOUND A] Please forgive
the unexpected visit.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.930
I'm one of the
Tokyo Bloodhounds.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:07.224
Lieutenant Tomitake
sent me here.

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:10.519
For your own safety,
please remain quiet.

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.233
Mii. Is Tomitake okay?

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.108
He is.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.236
But the situation
here is unstable.

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:22.197
For the moment,
he wants you under our watch.

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:26.493
[BLOODHOUND B]
Excuse me, sir.

00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:29.079
We were hoping we could
get some bushes pruned.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.832
[OKONOGI] Well! I was
just about to open up.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:34.251
Gimme a sec, please,
if you would.

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:36.920
Come on in.

00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:38.755
Sorry about the
state of the place.

00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:39.840
It's a mess.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.883
Let's get you two some tea.

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:46.096
[OKONOGI] So you tell me you got
some bushes in need of pruning.

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:47.931
In Okinomiya, I'm guessing?

00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:48.765
That's right.

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:51.518
And we'd like to get it
done as soon as possible.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.979
[OKONOGI]
Lemme ask you this first.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.772
Where'd you two come from?

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:56.773
[gasps]

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:57.732
[OKONOGI]
See.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:01.403
It's clear enough
you boys aren't locals.

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.655
And those accents say "Tokyo."

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.417
You're under arrest.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.419
Come quietly, Okonogi.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.587
And what are the charges?

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.922
Unwarranted execution of EM 34

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:23.425
and conspiracy
to commit a mutiny.

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:26.303
Miyo Takano is my CO and
I demand to speak to her.

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:28.138
Request denied.

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:30.432
Right. That's what's going on.

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:33.143
The little bird found out
what the cuckoo was planning.

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:34.227
Or maybe she decided she wanted

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:37.480
to leave the nest on her
own terms instead of ours.

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:43.320
Orders, Captain?

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:44.988
[OKONOGI]
Stand down!

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.365
It's too late to try
and make this a fight.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:51.244
Consider the operation aborted,
and give yourselves up now.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.497
Understood.

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:57.334
Where's Doctor Irie?
Did anything happen to him?

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:58.919
[BLOODHOUND D]
I apologize, sir.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.504
The clinic will be under
renovations for a while.

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:04.049
[VILLAGER B]
Really? Well, damn.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.258
[VILLAGER A]
Nothin' for it.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.676
We'll check back soon.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:18.688
We appreciate the cooperation,
Lieutenant Colonel.

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.485
I would prefer you
not call me by my rank.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.111
I'm just a doctor here.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:25.946
Doctor.

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:28.531
We'll be transferring you into
the Investigation Team's custody

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.408
when the inspection is done.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.576
Until that time,

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:33.119
you'll be with us.

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:35.080
I understand.

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.416
[IRIE] I appreciate
you taking the effort

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:41.461
not to wake up Satoshi.

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:44.464
He's in the late stages
of Hinamizawa Syndrome.

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.049
If he knew what
was happening now,

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:48.718
the fear and paranoia
would be crippling.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.720
He'd see everyone
here as an enemy.

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:53.473
[BLOODHOUND E]
What's with the teddy bear?

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:56.434
It was supposed to be a
gift for his sister, Satoko.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.019
A present he worked hard for

00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:00.313
and never had
the chance to give her.

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:03.483
I have every intention of coming
back here to treat Satoshi.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:06.820
Until Hinamizawa Syndrome
is fully eradicated,

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:09.155
my mission here
will not be complete.

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:11.199
I'm not the one you
have to convince, Doctor,

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:14.285
that'll be the Disciplinary
Committee's call.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.996
[VOICE]
Retriever Seven to all units.

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.455
We've located a locked suitcase

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.582
that matches Major
Takano's description

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.460
of the H‐173 specimen carrier.

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.587
Repeat. The suitcase
described in Major Takano's...

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:27.132
[IRIE]
It can't be.

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:39.436
It's H‐173.

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:41.187
This is a bioweapon.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.690
A refined strain
of Hinamizawa Syndrome.

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:46.109
One that progresses
it's victims to L5.

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:47.652
Straight to the terminal stage.

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:49.320
It's a terrifying thing.

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.448
Batch 170 was
supposed be destroyed,

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:53.867
but there's no
denying it's here!

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:03.710
[TOMITAKE]
Hey there, Rika.

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:04.878
Huh?

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:11.259
[RIKA]
Tomitake, you're okay!

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:13.887
It does feel a little unusual
seeing you still around

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:16.056
after the night of Watanagashi.

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:17.432
[laughs]

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:20.852
Well, most years I do go home
right after the festival ends.

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:23.813
That's not exactly
what I was talking about,

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:25.690
though I guess it's true.

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:28.359
But anyway, where did
you two go after we spoke?

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.945
Well, after we took off
from the festival,

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:32.697
I managed to get us
out of Hinamizawa

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:34.074
and rendezvous
with the Bloodhounds

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:36.493
before the Mountain Dogs
could catch our scent.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:39.579
I figured that doggy who showed
up at my house was yours.

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:40.872
[TOMITAKE laughs]

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:42.665
You know those guys
are special ops,

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:45.293
I don't think they'd appreciate
you calling 'em "doggies."

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:48.046
[RIKA]
Is my life still in any danger?

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:50.423
I promise it's
all gonna be fine.

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:52.175
We took over
Okonogi Landscaping,

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:54.010
so the Mountain Dogs
have no more front,

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:56.554
and we control Irie's clinic.

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.890
Did anything happen to Irie?

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:01.518
[TOMITAKE] Tokyo still has
him in custody for the moment,

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:02.811
but he'll be fine.

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:04.479
According to Takano's testimony,

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:07.357
Irie himself had no knowledge
of what she was planning,

00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:09.067
and all the evidence
we've gathered so far

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:10.735
seems to confirm that.

00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:13.571
The underground
research facility

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.698
is going to be
shut down permanently,

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.700
but the clinic will
be open again soon.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.828
You mean he's going
to be coming back?

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:20.912
[TOMITAKE]
Mm‐hmm.

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.414
The people in this village
will still need a doctor.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.333
What's more,
they need to know somebody

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:28.086
is still fighting to
cure Hinamizawa Syndrome.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:35.593
And her?

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.847
I couldn't say. Although.

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:40.682
Takano prevented
a lot of innocent blood

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:44.227
from being spilled by confessing
to her part in the plot.

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.354
Plus, the brass have
a bigger issue now.

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:49.566
This has exposed factional
fault lines within Tokyo.

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:52.152
I really don't think they would
come down on her too hard.

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:53.820
And the rest of
the organization treats

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.948
the Hinamizawa Syndrome
post like unexploded ordnance.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.200
None of 'em want any part of it.

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:01.911
Then does that mean they're
just planning to let her be?

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:02.829
Uh?

00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:04.122
[laughs]

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:07.208
Well, it might mean they don't
plan to hold onto her too long.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.210
But whenever they let her out.

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:13.840
I'm gonna be right
there to pick her up.

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:21.764
Is this really
how it's going to end?

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:24.058
Will there be no tragedy?

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.143
Did I come to the world

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:27.770
where the dice
land on six every time?

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:35.820
Or perhaps,
this world has no dice.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.697
It's impossible to say.

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:50.627
[RIKA]
What can this mean?

00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:54.297
Until now, every world I've come
to was destined for tragedy.

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:55.757
So what's going on?

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.304
It's like this
world saved itself.

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:02.513
As if the outcome was determined

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:05.475
before I even had a
chance to roll the dice.

00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:12.523
Could my fortune genuinely have
turned around so completely,

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:13.816
and so suddenly?

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:20.406
Or could it be that someone
else is rolling for me,

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:23.534
and I only imagined
that I was in control at all?

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:26.246
[HANYUU] Its blade has the
ability to sever the loops,

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.164
and offer an end
to those for whom death

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:30.250
is but another beginning.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:41.386
[RIKA] I finally reached
a world free of tragedy.

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:43.972
I've rolled one
six after another.

00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:46.307
Everything has been perfect.

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:49.185
All my friends
are alive and well.

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:50.937
And I can't trust it.

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:52.939
Why am I still so afraid?

00:12:57.568 --> 00:13:00.488
[SATOKO]
Why are you up here alone?

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.449
You do know I've been looking
everywhere for you, right?

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.034
Mii!

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:07.662
It's plain to see
you're feeling troubled.

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:10.707
Could there be something I don't
know about that's bothering you?

00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:13.042
It feels like everything's
perfect now,

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:16.421
and that's honestly starting
to scare me a little bit.

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:20.133
[SATOKO] I'm sorry for the
lack of hardship in your life.

00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:24.470
For whatever it's worth,
I could hardly be more content.

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:26.639
I have the privilege of
sharing this beautiful view

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:28.057
of the village where I grew up

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:29.767
with my dearest friend
in all the world.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:33.229
I can't imagine being
happier than I am now.

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:35.815
Doesn't your
heart feel full, Rika?

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:40.445
I do have a lot to be happy for.

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:44.449
I'm glad you recognize that.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.661
And I, for one, refuse to let
unfounded fears spoil my mood.

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:51.247
Happy moments are
such valuable things.

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:52.373
Letting them pass you by

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:56.836
is like not going to the
supermarket during a sale.

00:13:56.878 --> 00:14:00.006
Maybe all this worrying
is a waste of time.

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:01.883
And maybe you don't
quite understand

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:05.011
how happiness actually works.

00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:07.513
Even the smallest moments
of pain can leave marks

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:10.433
on our hearts that will
last the rest of our lives.

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:11.476
And yet,

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:15.355
those tiny moments of
happiness roll right off of us,

00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:17.106
and when we forget about them,

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:19.359
we forget all the
ways we're blessed.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.652
Until eventually,
even being perfectly content

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:24.822
leaves us yearning
for some greater happiness.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.241
How sad it would be,
not to let yourself be happy

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:30.161
for fear that it can't last.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:32.330
Aren't you happy
right now, Rika?

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:35.291
And don't you think that
should count for something?

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:37.377
[RIKA]
Hmm...

00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:39.170
It should count for a lot.

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:40.171
You're right.

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:43.383
It's wonderful that I get
to be here with you right now,

00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:45.885
and it does make me happy.

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:47.011
But it's true.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:53.476
I can't stop myself expecting
something terrible to happen.

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.978
Then for the time being, you're
just gonna have to keep living

00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:00.274
a happy, healthy life surrounded
by your loving friends.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:04.112
Luckily, this is Hinamizawa,
and as long as we're here,

00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:07.490
we're under Lord Oyashiro's
loving protection.

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:09.242
[RIKA] Lord Oyashiro
would get so flustered

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:12.161
hearing you say that.

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:14.622
[SATOKO]
Hey.

00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:16.624
Promise me you won't leave.

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.167
Okay, Rika?

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:26.426
[MION]
Okay! Get ready, kids.

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:29.303
Every day is game day
and every game's for keeps!

00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:32.223
The club's in session,
and the penalties are insane!

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:33.683
[chuckles]

00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:36.811
Now, who's going to be
today's unfortunate victim?

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:37.687
Yeah!

00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:39.021
Let's do this!

00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:40.606
And since Watanagashi is over,

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:42.608
I get to join in
with you guys this time!

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.402
I won't lose today!

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:45.236
Me neither!

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:48.072
None of you really understand
how much I'm capable of yet,

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:50.241
so you won't see me
coming until it's too late

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:51.325
[chortles]

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:53.578
Though you never
even try to set traps,

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:55.163
your ability to
cling to your delusions

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:58.374
through all your losses
always catches me off guard!

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.084
What's that,
you snotty little brat?

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.294
[cries]

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:03.963
You guys, Keiichi's
picking on me!

00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:08.217
He made Satoko cry,

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:11.095
and it's the cutest thing
I've ever seen in my life!

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:15.892
I'm keeping her!
Awww!

00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:20.146
Aww, poor, poor,
pitiful Keiichi.

00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:21.397
I wouldn't keep coming back

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:24.066
if I didn't like
a little bit of pain.

00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:26.027
Cool.

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:27.987
None of my business
what you're into.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:30.865
If that's your thing,
who am I to judge you, right?

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:43.586
[MION]
Kei with two pair!

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:47.048
[RIKA]
Three of a kind.

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:54.222
And Rika cleans us all out,
shocking no one.

00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:55.306
[MION]
I really screwed the pooch,

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:57.725
calling you on the
fifth hand like that.

00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:01.103
Amazing, Rika, your poker face
had me totally fooled!

00:17:01.145 --> 00:17:02.813
It was really just luck.

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:05.775
Everyone but Rika lost,
so who pays the penalty?

00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:09.445
Well obviously, everybody
has to pay up except Rika.

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:10.363
You call it.

00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:11.531
What're we doing?

00:17:11.572 --> 00:17:14.158
I already know
exactly what I want.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.244
I made these notes for everyone.

00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:18.162
These are your penalties.

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:21.791
Make sure not to look at
anybody's note but yours, okay?

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:26.003
Would you do
that for me, please?

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:26.879
Sure.

00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:29.257
That'll be no problem.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.384
Right, understood.

00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:32.343
[RENA]
Mm.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:35.638
I already know something
that'll be perfect for this!

00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:39.725
Rika, what's this about?

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:43.062
I decided to make you go
to the grocery store with me.

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:44.605
Ni‐paa!

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:49.151
This doesn't feel
like much of a penalty.

00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:52.655
Wasn't that basically like any
other trip to the grocery store?

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:54.991
We don't usually
spend nearly this much!

00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:56.200
I suppose not.

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:58.911
We did buy quite a bit of food.

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:01.247
So, if this was my penalty,

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.749
then what did you write
on everybody else's notes?

00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:05.376
[RIKA]
I can't tell you yet!

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:08.170
[SATOKO]
Hmm...

00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:10.089
That's not very nice.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.597
[RIKA]
You were right, Satoko.

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:21.642
I didn't know how happy I was
until you helped me realize it.

00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:23.894
I get it now, thanks to you,

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:26.731
and I want to share my
happiness when we're together.

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:31.110
And so.

00:18:31.152 --> 00:18:33.529
I asked all our friends
to help me with that!

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:43.623
Happy birthday, Satoko!

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:44.999
Surprise!

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:47.084
Yeah, happy birthday!

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:50.046
Satoko. Happy birthday!

00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:52.381
[MION]
Mm! And many more!

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:54.884
Wow, you guys.

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:56.218
Rika really went out of her way

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.512
to pull together
a party for you!

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:00.348
Here, take a look at this.

00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:11.317
[SATOKO] I appreciate
all of your efforts.

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:13.569
I just...

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:16.322
I know your birthday can bring
back a lot of painful memories

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:19.659
that make it hard
for you to celebrate.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.577
Yeah, it does.

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:25.623
[RIKA] But hopefully, it'll be
better if we all at least try.

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:27.792
Honestly, that's the
most pompous thing

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.752
I've ever heard you say.

00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:36.008
All my friends are here
to celebrate my birthday.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.720
Did you really think you
wouldn't make me happy?

00:19:39.762 --> 00:19:42.014
Great. Now to open these!

00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:43.182
Oh, my.

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:44.892
What might you be?

00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:51.482
Uh... A vegetable encyclopedia?

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:52.400
Maybe now that you have this,

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:54.527
you'll finally be able
to recognize the difference

00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:56.570
between broccoli
and cauliflower.

00:19:56.612 --> 00:19:57.446
[SATOKO growls]

00:19:57.488 --> 00:19:59.115
Well, in spite of your smugness.

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:01.575
I actually know everything,
including that.

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:02.618
[chuckles]

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.870
You should open my gift now!

00:20:05.746 --> 00:20:08.582
I see, that's unexpected.

00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:12.962
Awooo! Kyute!

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:15.089
I wanna take both
of you home with me!

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.633
What, are you trying
to keep her present, too?

00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:20.219
So when do we get to see
what you brought her?

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:21.929
Who, me? Well I'll admit,

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:24.223
I couldn't manage to come up
with anything mind‐blowing,

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:26.434
but I hope it's something
that she'll like!

00:20:27.685 --> 00:20:29.937
Just tell me if you
want any more, okay?

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:31.105
Oh, Mion.

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:32.565
All of you, really.

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:34.108
Thank you so much.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.277
Truly, I couldn't be happier!

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:37.236
Mii.

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:38.529
Get ready, 'cause I'm gonna make

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:41.407
the greatest birthday
feast of your life!

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:43.701
And I'd like you
all to join us, too!

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:44.952
Ni‐paa!

00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:47.246
Is that what the
groceries were all about?

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:49.290
You thought of everything,
huh, Rika!

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:52.668
But before we leave, I also have
another present to give you.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:53.669
[SATOKO]
Goodness.

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:55.129
There's more?

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:59.800
It was all I could afford,
but I hope you'll like it.

00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:02.845
[SATOKO] My! I'm shaking
with anticipation!

00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:12.646
[RENA]
Satoko?

00:21:15.816 --> 00:21:18.986
How could you have known
what was in this box?

00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:24.366
[chortles]

00:21:24.408 --> 00:21:26.160
I am shocked that you
would even attempt

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:28.204
such an obvious ploy
against the undisputed

00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:30.581
trap master of our game club!

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.136
[gasps]

00:21:44.762 --> 00:21:46.055
[RIKA] It's true that
I had been planning

00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:50.768
to play a prank on you with
this gift, up until last night.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.854
Or could it be that someone
else is rolling for me,

00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:56.690
and I only imagined that
I was in control at all?

00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:58.692
I decided to trade it for
something I knew

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:01.278
would make you happy.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.490
[HANYUU] Its blade has
the ability to sever the loops.

00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:08.160
[RIKA]
I'll ask again.

00:22:08.202 --> 00:22:10.371
How could you have known that?

00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:13.791
[gasps]

00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:53.849
[RIKA] Next time:
