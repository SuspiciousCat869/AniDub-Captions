WEBVTT

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:13.472
[KEIICHI]
They shot us down?

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:14.640
[KIMIYOSHI]
Completely.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.476
That's direct from my source
in the local government.

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.019
[SHION]
How foolish.

00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:21.980
They should know better than
to pick a fight with Hinamizawa.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.650
[RIKA]
Those poor, poor bureaucrats!

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.860
[KEIICHI] This just means
we'll have to push harder!

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:29.279
No way we can back down
when we've come this far!

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:30.697
After this we're
gonna head straight

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.741
to the Child Welfare office.

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:35.202
I'll rally some members
of the village council.

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:36.370
We can take this up with Oryo

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.455
and try to figure out
our next move.

00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:40.415
That'll be an important meeting.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.668
Oryo's response
will decide our turnout.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:43.627
Yeah.

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:45.462
We'll know how seriously
she's taking this

00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:47.172
by the size of the crowd.

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:50.509
According to Mother, the hag
is preparing for an all‐out war.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:52.553
I'd count on at least 30 more.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:55.514
It'll feel better having
the adults there with us!

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:58.016
Well, Child Welfare, get ready!

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.188
[RENA]
Oh wow.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.190
Is this whole crowd
from Hinamizawa?

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:06.775
[MION]
Definitely not everyone.

00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:10.362
I recognize some of these
people from around Okinomiya!

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:11.363
[RIKA]
You were right.

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.657
It looks like
Oryo is going all in.

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:15.367
I did miss this feeling.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.786
Kind of like we're fighting
the second dam war.

00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:20.080
[IRIE]
Look at the size of this crowd!

00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:22.541
[CHIE] All of Onigafuchi
assembled here in force.

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:24.459
It's incredible what
you've accomplished!

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:25.335
I agree.

00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:27.254
This is truly impressive work.

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:29.506
So you got this many
people to come out here?

00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:32.426
Dang, Keiichi, you're some
kinda village big shot.

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:35.095
Well, it's not just me.

00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:37.014
[KIMIYOSHI]
Keiichi!

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:39.683
Quite the crowd
you gathered here, son.

00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:40.892
[KEIICHI]
Mister Mayor.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.562
How many people did the
council call in to join us?

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:45.480
[KIMIYOSHI]
Oh, we didn't get a count.

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:47.816
We all just asked everyone
we knew to show up here,

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:50.027
and this is what we got.

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:52.487
Folks! Listen up!

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:55.949
This action is on behalf of
the Hinamizawa village council.

00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:58.535
No Onigafuchi
Defensive Alliance signs!

00:01:58.577 --> 00:02:00.329
Keiichi.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.581
This is the final confrontation.

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:05.792
Sure is. It ends here.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.795
And now,
we'll strike the last blow.

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:12.466
This is an issue.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:14.509
The crowd out there is enormous.

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:15.719
What should we do?

00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:17.596
I'm going to have
to leave that to you,

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:20.223
I've got business to take
care of outside the city.

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.351
Respectfully,
it might not be wise

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:24.686
to exit the building
right now, sir.

00:02:24.728 --> 00:02:27.147
You say that like
we're under siege.

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:27.981
[HARAYAMA]
During the dam war,

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:29.524
the villagers'
demonstrations gave way

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.194
to violence on
more than one occasion.

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.528
Well, I suppose my business

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.448
isn't urgent enough
to warrant the risk.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.533
[KIMIYOSHI]
Uh, test!

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.077
Hello, we're here on behalf

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.579
of the Hinamizawa
Village Council!

00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:45.791
If they wanted to, they could
barge in any minute, sir.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.293
You cannot let them in here!

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:50.170
[KEIICHI]
There's still more.

00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:51.755
This is amazing.

00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:53.757
[KIMIYOSHI]
Okay. Let's do this.

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:56.927
[IRIE]
Is that...?

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.595
Well, Mister Maebara!

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:00.931
How are you doing this morning?

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.060
[KEIICHI]
Ooishi?

00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:06.395
What are you doing here?

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:09.773
Well, there's something we
urgently need to discuss.

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:13.318
I'd like you in the conversation
as well, Mayor Kimiyoshi.

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.450
[KEIICHI]
What are you trying to say?

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:22.077
[OOISHI]
I'll make this simple.

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.870
It's illegal to
disrupt the activities

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:28.500
of a government agency such
as Child Welfare Services.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:31.670
So the city's just gonna shut
out the voices of the people?

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:33.171
We're not disrupting anything;

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.841
we're asking them to do
their jobs and help Satoko!

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.593
[OOISHI] With an unlawful
assembly outside their door.

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:41.263
And you don't get to
decide what's disruptive.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:42.973
That falls to the
highest‐ranking official

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:44.641
working in the office.

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.685
He can ban you from
the premises if he believes

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:49.229
that's what's needed
for them to do their jobs.

00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:50.063
Maybe so,

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:52.607
but we can still take our
protest across the street!

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.651
To do that, you'll need
a street protesting permit

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:57.195
from the prefectural government.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.030
And there's no way
that's happening today,

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:01.116
so you kids will
need to pack it in.

00:04:01.158 --> 00:04:02.242
[KEIICHI]
Like hell!

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:04.369
All these people
showed up for Satoko.

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:06.496
We can't walk away now!

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:08.415
Look, Maebara,
you're drawing the wrong

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:11.668
kind of attention from
some folks around here.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.589
I warned ya, it's a real
dangerous place to make enemies.

00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:19.634
Detective, I can't stop you
or anyone else

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.928
from forming opinions about me

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.180
But if you have
any heart at all,

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:26.641
then please, look the other way
and let us help our friend!

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:27.559
[OOISHI]
Easy!

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:28.769
If those fists start swinging,

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.312
you're gonna get
tossed in a cell

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.481
on a police obstruction charge.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:33.774
‐‐[KEIICHI] Dammit!
‐‐[MION] Kei!

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.358
Don't give him what he wants!

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.985
[SHION]
Detective Ooishi.

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:39.738
That attitude of yours could
prove bad for your health.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.115
Goodness, you're scaring me!

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:45.327
It almost sounded like you were
threatening a police officer,

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.788
but I'm sure you know
better than that, don't you?

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:49.831
[chuckles]

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:51.166
[MION]
The law's on their side.

00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:52.876
There's no way around it.

00:04:52.918 --> 00:04:54.753
We either pipe down
and play along,

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:57.005
or we throw down with the cops.

00:04:57.047 --> 00:05:00.926
[OOISHI laughs]
The dam war is over, folks.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.469
Let's stop playing pretend

00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:04.971
and let the grown‐ups
do their work.

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.598
[KUMAGAI]
Ooishi!

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.184
The chief's on the radio,
and he's calling for you!

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:10.727
Ah, thanks for the heads up.

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:13.313
Seems like my boss wants
to get hold of me, everyone.

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:14.272
So...

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.442
I'd appreciate it if you could
get this crowd to disperse.

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:19.694
[KEIICHI]
That bastard!

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:20.779
Now what?

00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:22.697
Can we leave and come back?

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:23.907
Won't matter.

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:25.075
The guy who's running the center

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:27.035
doesn't feel like
dealing with us.

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:31.665
I think we pissed 'em off enough
to get shut out completely.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.834
So they're gonna
drag this thing out.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:34.709
Are we just gonna have to wait

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.420
until they've cooled off
to go after them again?

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.256
[RENA]
But we can't quit now.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.800
Satoko won't make it
if we wait that long!

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:44.302
I don't really know
how I know that,

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.720
but I'm sure of it!

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:49.224
I understand what
you're saying, but still.

00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:52.143
[RIKA]
I want you all to believe this.

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:55.689
Everyone's doing everything
they can for Satoko right now.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.357
It's true, isn't it?

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.733
What do you mean?

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:01.069
[RIKA] It's something you
said to me before, Mion.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:02.279
Huh?

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.905
It's the truth.

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:05.949
Everybody's been doing
everything in their power

00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:07.450
to help Satoko.

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:08.785
Then wait.

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:11.413
Until the wind
blows in our favor!

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.540
You know lying
to the chief like that

00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:15.584
could come back
to bite you, right?

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:16.918
You haven't made
any kind of progress

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.253
talking with their leaders.

00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:20.088
[laughs]

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.924
I don't think I said a single
thing that I would call a lie.

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:25.719
There's a real chance
this whole thing turns violent.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.221
We have every right
to disperse them by force,

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:29.639
so why wouldn't we?

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:30.515
Come on.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.475
Don't be like that, Kuma.

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:34.436
‐‐Huh?
‐‐They got all these people here

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:37.188
for the sake of one
little girl in a tough spot.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.357
It's quite the
accomplishment, isn't it?

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.859
And if the village council
showed up,

00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:44.404
that means Oryo Sonozaki
herself has their backs.

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:46.698
I can't help
but respect the kids' drive.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.991
So that's it.

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:50.327
I knew you were
going easy on 'em.

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.412
It's not like you
to talk things out.

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:53.705
You'd normally start twisting

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:56.458
that boy's arm at the
first excuse he gave you.

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:59.002
If Mister Maebara wants
to play the hero for today,

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:01.254
I suppose I don't
mind letting him.

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:04.466
Hey, care for a smoke?

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.262
[OOISHI] That boy charges
headlong through everything

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:10.305
in front of him.

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:13.725
He doesn't doubt for a
second that he's in the right.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:14.601
Say again?

00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:16.269
[OOISHI chuckles]

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.188
I think it's time
we play pretend,

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.440
and let the kid
handle the real work.

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:21.566
The kid?

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.027
Here they come.

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:26.821
[OOISHI]
Our VIPs.

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:27.906
[clears throat]

00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:29.407
Let's go, Kuma.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.994
We need to talk to
Keiichi right this instant.

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:35.622
You here, boy?

00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:37.540
[KEIICHI]
That's me, sir.

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:38.959
How can I help you?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.336
[SABURO]
Other way around, son.

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:43.672
Fact is, we came
here to help you.

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:45.423
[MION]
Uncle, is that you?

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:46.967
What are you doing here?

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:50.845
It's true,
but I can't believe it.

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.597
Gotta stand tall, Keiichi.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.392
You're our general, and
it's time to rally the troops.

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:56.434
Ready?

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.228
But the police...

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:02.190
Hey, gentlemen,
a moment, please?

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:03.650
[SABURO]
Whose pig are you?

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.443
Last I heard, you worked
for these people,

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.946
and you got no
right shuttin' 'em up!

00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:10.991
Hello there,
Assemblyman Sonozaki.

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:13.076
[KEIICHI]
Assemblyman?

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:14.452
[SABURO]
Save it!

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.371
Now gimme the name
of whatever idiot

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:18.581
is ordering you to disperse us!

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:22.502
[OOISHI laughs] That'd be the
chief of police, Assemblyman.

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:23.712
[SABURO]
Then the Okinomiya police

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.964
are gonna be hearing
from my office.

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.799
Pass that on to your boss!

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.093
Yes, I'm happy
to inform the chief,

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:34.139
but my duty is to the law,
and it's not on your side here.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:34.973
[KEN]
Detective.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.892
Ken Sonozaki, attorney.

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:39.811
Child Welfare's
claim that this protest

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:42.605
is impeding their work
goes beyond frivolous.

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:45.275
It could more appropriately
be called corrupt.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:46.234
If you need details‐‐

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:47.444
[OOISHI]
Oh, there's no need,

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.612
I'm sure it's all well
above my paygrade.

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:51.573
Please go ahead, gentlemen.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:52.991
Well, that took long enough.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.034
Man alive.

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.994
That means you're up, Maebara.

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:58.121
There's nothing else
standing in your way now.

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:00.040
Okay!

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:00.999
C'mon, guys!

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.584
[ALL 4]
Mm.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.545
If they're here, it must
mean Oryo called them in.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.130
We went to Grandma
for her blessing,

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:09.841
but I didn't think she was
gonna bring out the big guns.

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:13.136
She lent us the full power
of the Sonozaki clan.

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:15.680
Amazing.
Did the demoness grow a heart?

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:17.974
Well, it's no surprise
to me at all.

00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:19.225
I knew from the start
that your grandma

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:22.062
was gonna help us
however she could!

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:23.521
[KEIICHI]
I see.

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:26.608
I know I said all
that stuff to her before.

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.068
But right now I could kiss her

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:29.986
right on that
foul mouth of hers!

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:31.237
[RENA]
Okay, guys!

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.156
We're moving in!

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:37.410
Maebara!

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.079
We're with you!

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.831
We just know you guys
are gonna save Hojo!

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:42.791
Maebara!

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.085
We'll be out here waiting
for the good news!

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:47.462
I'm looking forward
to seeing you all win this!

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:49.964
We're rooting for you!

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.549
Hang on, Satoko.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:52.926
We're coming!

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.762
[CHIEF] Why are they
letting them in the building?

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:57.806
What the hell
happened to the cops?

00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:58.848
[HARAYAMA]
Well, sir.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.309
Assemblyman Sonozaki is here.

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:02.811
Hey, hold on.

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:05.814
The office is about
to close soon anyway.

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.941
I can ride this out in here.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:08.983
Wait, sir.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.152
Meeting with them
may be our best move.

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:12.445
[CHIEF]
I'm not doing that!

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:13.947
I refuse to allow an angry mob

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:16.616
to dictate my work
as a civil servant!

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:17.742
[phone rings]

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:20.620
Whoever it is, I'm not here!

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:22.163
[HARAYAMA]
Harayama speaking.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.332
[HARAYAMA]
What?

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.211
[HARAYAMA]
Just a moment, please.

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:31.005
It seems city hall is
on the line for you, sir.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:32.757
[CHIEF]
What? Who?

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.175
[HARAYAMA]
The mayor himself.

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:35.969
[gasps]

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.013
[MAYOR] Yes, I'm gonna ask you
to go ahead and hear them out.

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:40.974
Matters such as this
one sometimes require

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:43.685
a more individually
tailored approach, right?

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:45.270
[laughs]

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.063
Thanks for taking care of it.

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:48.314
Before I let you go,

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:50.608
I will be expecting a report
on the day's events

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.820
delivered to my office by
close of business day today.

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:55.947
Meaning six pm, yes.

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.866
Great, have a good day.

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:02.787
[ORYO] Much obliged
to you, Mister Mayor.

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:03.788
[MAYOR]
Hardly, ma'am.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.373
If the matter struck
you as urgent enough

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:06.708
to see me about it in person,

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:08.835
I would be a fool to ignore it.

00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:11.045
Don't make so
much of it, really.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:12.964
Anyone askin' a favor of anyone

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:15.425
oughta ask it
themselves, is all.

00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:16.759
Thanks for hearin' me.

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:18.094
[MAYOR]
No thanks needed, ma'am,

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:20.763
this is amends for how my
subordinates treated you.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:21.681
They answer to me,

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.725
and it took this long
to set 'em straight.

00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:26.269
Your village is raising
some impressive kids.

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:28.605
I'm truly amazed at the
amount of time and effort

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:31.065
they've been willing
to put in to help a friend.

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:33.693
[ORYO]
Boy, you ain't wrong about that!

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.403
Helps me sleep
better at night knowin'

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:38.156
there'll still be someone
fightin' for Hinamizawa

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:39.490
if I don't wake up.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.577
Do you mind not talking
casually about death, Mother?

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:43.828
[ORYO laughs]

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.414
Those kids are
the salt of the earth!

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:47.457
You better promise me

00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:50.460
that you'll always look out
for that Keiichi boy.

00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:53.171
You were so quick
to warm up to that child,

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.256
but I do hope that isn't
because you're still wishing

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:58.134
I'd given you
a grandson to spoil.

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:00.303
My sincerest apologies
for the trouble!

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:03.306
You're going to do something
to help Satoko, aren't you?

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:04.390
[CHIEF]
Right away!

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:05.266
Assistant Manager!

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:07.018
Please head straight
to the Hojo residence!

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.103
[HARAYAMA]
Wha...? You're sending me, sir?

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:11.147
But wouldn't her
case worker be better?

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:12.357
There's no time.

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:13.983
Satoko is in danger!

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:16.819
[HARAYAMA]
Understood! I'm on my way!

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:20.657
[gasps]

00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:22.909
[OOISHI chuckles]

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:24.869
A moment, Mister Maebara.

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:27.372
Are you still gonna try
and get in our way now?

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:28.623
[OOISHI]
Not at all.

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:30.416
Mister Harayama?

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:32.335
If you're headed
for the Hojo residence,

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:35.088
I would be happy
to give you a ride.

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:36.297
Are you sure?

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:37.298
[RENA]
If the police are with them,

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.300
Satoko's uncle
will have no choice

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:41.761
but to let
Child Welfare come in.

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.471
Right, but why now?

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:46.599
You were against us a little
while ago, so what changed?

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.393
[laughs]

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:49.727
The folks here at Child Welfare

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:53.064
never got a full view of how
bad things are in that house.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:56.109
This way they get to see
it up close and in person.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.611
Thanks for doing this
for us, Detective.

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:01.072
[OOISHI] This way please,
Mister Harayama.

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:03.658
[OOISHI]
Oh, right!

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.659
Since that's dealt with,

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:08.121
could the crowd
kindly disperse now?

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:10.623
Well, you folks
have a good year!

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:16.212
[KEIICHI]
It's finally over.

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:17.839
We won, didn't we?

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.173
[RIKA]
You did it, Keiichi.

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:21.384
You threw a die
with a one on every side

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:23.219
and somehow you rolled a six.

00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:24.512
A dice roll?

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:27.140
[RIKA] What you accomplished
shouldn't be possible,

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:30.601
but that didn't keep you
from pulling it off.

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:32.895
Sorry, but honestly
a lot of the stuff you say

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:35.106
goes right over my head, Rika.

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:38.568
It means,
you finally won, Keiichi.

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:43.698
[phone rings]

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:44.782
[KEIICHI]
Hello?

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:45.783
[SATOKO]
Keiichi?

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:46.659
[KEIICHI]
Are you okay?

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:47.910
Someone from
Child Welfare should have

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:49.495
come with Detective Ooishi‐‐

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:51.539
[SATOKO]
I'm fine; take a deep breath.

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:52.874
Yes, they did come by.

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:54.834
And what happened then?

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.878
[SATOKO] I always
thought that being strong

00:13:56.919 --> 00:14:00.631
meant keeping quiet and
bearing the pain by myself.

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:02.216
I thought that
was the lesson nii‐nii

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:05.470
was trying to leave me
with before he went away.

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:06.804
[KEIICHI]
Satoko.

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.932
[SATOKO] But then I saw what you
and the others had done for me,

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:12.185
and that was when
I realized something.

00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:15.396
I understand what
nii‐nii wanted from me now,

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:17.690
and I know what it is
he left for me.

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:19.442
My uncle's hands
dug into my shoulders

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:21.194
when the doorbell rang.

00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:23.905
I was just standing there,
shaking in fear.

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:26.908
I was so scared
I could barely breathe.

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.702
But I gathered all
my courage and yelled,

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:31.746
"Please help me!"

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:35.124
Then you had
a tough fight today.

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:36.834
[SATOKO chortles]

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.754
I can handle myself when
the situation calls for it!

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:41.964
You can.
I always knew that.

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:44.050
So did he go along peacefully?

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:46.469
[SATOKO] No, he flew into
a rage and tried to hurt me,

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:49.389
but Mister Ooishi
was able to restrain him,

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.557
and the police brought
him to the station.

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:54.394
You don't need to
worry about me anymore.

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:55.937
I'm sure that none
of us will be hearing

00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:58.022
from my uncle for a long while.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:14:59.315
Really?

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:01.692
I think I owe Ooishi an apology.

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:05.780
Turns out he's not
the jerk I thought he was.

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:08.116
So, that's it.

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:10.660
The fight is really over,
and we won.

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:11.911
[SATOKO]
Exactly right.

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:12.829
Which means tomorrow

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.456
we can put our full energy
into enjoying the festival.

00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:17.750
[KEIICHI laughs]
Yeah, sounds like a plan!

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.127
We fought like hell,

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:22.213
and now it's time for our club
to take the festival by storm,

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:24.298
and live happily ever after!

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.008
[SATOKO] I trust I can expect
you to accompany me

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:29.971
to Rika's ceremonial dance
tomorrow evening, correct?

00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:32.390
I so look forward to it!

00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:57.915
[doorbell rings]

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:04.672
I came here to escort you.

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:06.215
Ni‐pah!

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:09.302
[SATOKO] Please excuse
the delay, everyone!

00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:10.636
[RENA]
Satoko!

00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:11.554
Coach said you were scheduled

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:12.972
for a check‐up at the clinic,

00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:14.640
but he told me
you skipped out on it.

00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:15.892
Are you okay?

00:16:15.933 --> 00:16:18.478
Yeah, right now I'm
the best I've ever been!

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:19.479
I get it!

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.855
It's 'cause you were
too scared to spend

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:23.816
a whole night in the clinic
by yourself, isn't it?

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.818
Satoko has had a
hard time falling asleep

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.404
in a bed without me for
as long as I've known her.

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:30.865
Ohh! I need to hear details!

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:31.908
Details!

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:33.576
Hear the details, huh?

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:35.161
[SATOKO]
Hold it right there!

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:36.954
I'm not exactly sure
what you take me for,

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.539
but I don't like your tone!

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:40.708
[laughter]

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.919
[RENA] Honestly, I was
beginning to wonder

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.086
if we would ever get the chance

00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:46.464
to all laugh together
like this again.

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:49.217
So was I, but we
all pulled through.

00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:51.677
As a team.

00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:52.803
[RENA]
Mm.

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:53.763
[MION]
Now!

00:16:53.804 --> 00:16:55.223
Since Kei and Shion
are here with us,

00:16:55.264 --> 00:16:58.809
time for the Watanagashi Six
Demon Battle Royale!

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.394
You're sure you're
ready for that?

00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:02.146
You shouldn't underestimate me.

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:05.107
No idea what we're doing,
but I'm doing it!

00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:06.776
[MION]
The rules are simple.

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:09.028
Whoever has the best time
tonight is the winner!

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.112
Sound good, everyone?

00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:11.489
[RIKA]
Yeah!

00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:26.754
Hey, Satoko!

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:27.755
We were all worried.

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:28.881
You okay, kid?

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:32.051
[VILLAGER C] If you're ever in
trouble, just give us a shout!

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:34.470
[VILLAGER B]
And you too, Maebara!

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:36.222
Ya done good!

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:49.527
Huh? Satoko?

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:51.279
The dance is just starting.

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:59.203
[KEIICHI]
So why'd we come up here?

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:01.122
[SATOKO]
Rika told me everything.

00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:02.540
She told me how
hard you've been working

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:04.959
to try and help me
get away from my uncle.

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:06.669
[KEIICHI]
Well, of course I did.

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:09.964
That's what friends do, right?

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:13.134
[SATOKO] And I'm so grateful
for all you've done for me.

00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:15.177
Which is why
I feel a little guilty

00:18:15.219 --> 00:18:18.347
asking for one more thing.

00:18:18.389 --> 00:18:20.266
You can say no.

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:24.770
But could I please call
you "nii‐nii" from now on?

00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:26.689
Huh? But that's...

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:28.733
[SATOKO]
Do you not like "nii‐nii"?

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:31.527
[KEIICHI] No. I don't
mind but, I thought‐‐

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:35.114
Okay, then that
settles it! Nii‐nii!

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:37.533
[SATOKO]
My nii‐nii.

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:43.873
Yeah. I'm right here.

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:48.794
And I also have something
I'd really like to give you.

00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:51.047
It's something that was
very important to my nii‐nii

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:52.965
when he was still with me.

00:18:53.007 --> 00:18:55.217
But starting today you're
going to be my nii‐nii,

00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:57.136
and I think it's only right
that you should have it,

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:58.929
okay, Keiichi?

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:01.015
[KEIICHI]
If you really think so.

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:05.519
[SATOKO] I'd be so
embarrassed if this got out.

00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:07.396
Can we leave
before we're missed?

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:17.698
[SATOKO] Just try to
make yourself at home.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:21.243
We're family now, which means
it's your house, too, nii‐nii!

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:29.502
[SATOKO] I'll be right back,
so you can wait for me here.

00:19:29.543 --> 00:19:30.544
[KEIICHI]
Okay.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.633
[KEIICHI]
Let's see.

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:36.926
Where's the light?

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:44.517
[KEIICHI screams in agony]

00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:49.397
[gasps]

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:53.234
[TEPPEI]
You think you can fuck with me?

00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:55.861
Uncle Teppei!

00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:58.072
[TEPPEI] You think I got time
to deal with some little shit

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:01.659
screwin' around
in my life, do ya?

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:04.161
Well, I'm about done
bein' fucked with!

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:06.205
Die!

00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:08.958
[KEIICHI screams]

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.963

[SATOKO whimpers]

[knocking on door]

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:14.231
[door opens]

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.483
[KUMAGAI]
Do you remember me?

00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:16.901
We've met.

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:20.070
[KEIICHI] You were the guy
who was with Ooishi that day.

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:21.655
It's Kumagai.

00:21:21.697 --> 00:21:23.157
I'd like you to tell me
what happened

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:25.785
on the night of the
Watanagashi festival.

00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.161
Let me think.

00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:29.580
Satoko and I walked
to her house,

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:31.373
and then we went inside.

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:32.708
[grunts]

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.044
It's like my head's splitting.

00:21:35.085 --> 00:21:37.171
I'll get the doctor!

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:41.217
I'll be okay.

00:21:41.258 --> 00:21:45.012
I just can't think,
and I keep trying,

00:21:45.054 --> 00:21:47.765
but the memory
keeps slipping away.

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:50.017
Oh, I see.

00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:50.893
[KEIICHI]
Sir.

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:51.936
Where's the detective?

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:52.895
Huh?

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:56.148
I was hoping I could thank him.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.651
[KUMAGAI] Please call me
if anything comes back to you.

00:21:58.692 --> 00:21:59.693
[KEIICHI]
Huh?

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:13.624
[RENA]
Hi Keiichi.

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:15.876
Felt like coming outside?

00:22:15.918 --> 00:22:19.088
It's not fair to keep secrets
from me like this, Rena.

00:22:19.129 --> 00:22:22.424
What the hell even happened
on the night of the festival?

00:22:22.466 --> 00:22:25.636
I haven't heard from
Mion or Shion or Rika.

00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:27.847
Even Satoko hasn't come
to visit me in the hospital

00:22:27.888 --> 00:22:30.015
since it happened.

00:22:30.057 --> 00:22:32.977
It may sound strange,

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:35.521
but I'm glad you were
at Satoko's house,

00:22:35.563 --> 00:22:37.648
instead of at
the festival with us.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:38.983
What?

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:42.027
When you were gone,

00:22:42.069 --> 00:22:44.405
after the cotton drifting,

00:22:44.446 --> 00:22:46.824
Ooishi was at the shrine.

00:22:46.866 --> 00:22:49.368
And he just started
raging at the crowd,

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:52.204
and then he pulled his gun.

00:22:52.246 --> 00:22:53.956
[shudders]

00:22:53.998 --> 00:22:57.293
And Mion, and Shion,
and Rika and Satoko.

00:22:57.334 --> 00:22:59.837
The detective was
killing everyone!

00:22:59.879 --> 00:23:01.589
They're dead?

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.757
[RENA]
I don't understand any of this.

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:05.009
We'd won.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.220
It was all supposed to be okay!

00:23:08.262 --> 00:23:10.097
Why did my friends have to die?

00:23:10.139 --> 00:23:11.932
Why did I have to watch?

00:23:11.974 --> 00:23:15.769
Why? None of it makes any sense!

00:23:52.973 --> 00:23:56.393
