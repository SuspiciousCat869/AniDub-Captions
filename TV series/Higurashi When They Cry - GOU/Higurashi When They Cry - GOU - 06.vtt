WEBVTT

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:13.555
What's wrong with these freaks?

00:00:13.597 --> 00:00:16.141
[PUNK B]
Hey, quit starin'!

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.894
What the hell's goin' on?

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:19.978
[OOISHI]
Now, now, folks,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.981
I'm sure there's no need
for all the commotion.

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:29.196
Oh, Detective!
These men are extortionists.

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:31.406
Hey, get your hands off me!

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:34.743
[OOISHI] All right, boys,
we get it, settle down.

00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:37.329
Hey there, kiddo.

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.164
They didn't hurt you, did they?

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:41.166
No. I'm all right.

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:45.087
[OOISHI chuckles] Well, it
certainly could have gone worse.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:47.798
You made that call right
in the nick of time, folks.

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:48.423
Thanks.

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:51.510
Thank you for all your hard
work, Detective Ooishi.

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:54.263
As a detective, I'm sure
you've got a lot on your plate.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:55.722
Think nothing of it.

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:57.391
Your call happened
to come in just as we were

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:59.768
on our way back
to the station anyway.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.020
We barely even had
to take a detour.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.856
[MION] Glad to have
you looking after us!

00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:50.921
[KEIICHI]
That could've been bad.

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:53.006
Thanks a lot
for the assist, Shion.

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:55.092
Hey, now. It's no big deal.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.719
I'll figure out a way
to pay you back for it.

00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:00.931
Okay. I suppose next time
I'm in a tight spot,

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:02.724
you can come help me out, right?

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.185
Uh. Yeah. Definitely.

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:06.228
It's a promise.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.772
[MION laughs]
I'm holding you to it!

00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:11.441
Now I just need
to find a tight spot to be in.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.028
You're feeling better!

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.030
Now I know you're the real Kei.

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:18.782
Not some gloomy imposter!

00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:20.033
Hey, cut that out already!

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:21.243
Shouldn't you be
working right now

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:22.661
instead of
squishing my face?

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:24.121
My manager was very appreciative

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:27.207
when I told him you'd saved me
from those filthy gutter punks.

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.501
So much so that
he told me to treat you!

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:32.838
[KEIICHI] What? So you told him
the opposite of what happened.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.214
And that doesn't bother you?

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:36.633
[MION]
Not in the least.

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:39.094
After all, if I were you,

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:41.471
I'd've been scared
when everybody closed in.

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:43.974
All those people were from
Hinamizawa, weren't they?

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.225
Yes, they were.

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:47.811
A threat to one
is a threat to us all.

00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:50.856
Everyone looks out
for each other in the village.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.858
Sounds like a
close‐knit community.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.651
[MION] And that's
how it's been for decades.

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:57.237
Whenever something threatens
the future of Hinamizawa,

00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:59.865
the people of the village
come together and fight back.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:00.824
What do you mean?

00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:01.908
[MION]
For instance,

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.661
have you heard about the
Hinamizawa Dam Project?

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.414
Yeah. A little bit.
It got cancelled, right?

00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:09.124
We made that happen.

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:11.084
We pushed back and won.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.087
In order to construct the dam,

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.881
they would've had
to flood Hinamizawa

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.341
and the surrounding villages.

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.260
So we ramped up our protests,

00:04:20.302 --> 00:04:23.430
and pretty soon the riot police
started getting rough with us.

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:26.224
[KEIICHI] Wait, the police just
started attacking civilians?

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.435
[MION]
They did, with boots and batons!

00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:30.979
I took a few hits
from them myself.

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:33.607
We treated that
as a declaration of war.

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.984
We went to court seeking
an injunction,

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:39.196
and protested at the city
and prefectural assemblies.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:42.032
Anything we could do
to disrupt their plans.

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:44.159
Our public support kept growing
until they were forced

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:47.454
to put construction
on hold indefinitely.

00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:50.832
We won in the end because we
were all able to come together.

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.959
The villagers understand the
value of solidarity,

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:55.462
and that's the reason
we're still here today.

00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:57.464
That's a pretty
impressive story.

00:04:57.506 --> 00:04:58.715
Uniting behind a cause,

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.884
protecting one another
from the powers that be.

00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:03.136
It was quite a
difficult time for us all,

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:05.055
but after fighting our way
through the hardship,

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:06.932
I think we're
better off for it now.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.518
Sorry. We need you
over here Sonozaki.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.478
Can you come take the register?

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.688
Ah! Okay, coming!

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.564
I'm sorry.

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:18.109
It seems that's all
the time I can spare.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.195
[KEIICHI]
Hey, Mion!

00:05:20.237 --> 00:05:22.447
Thanks again
for everything today.

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.282
I'll make it up to you somehow.

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.202
It's nice to hear that,
and I intend to hold you to it.

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:28.787
See you later!

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:35.126
[AIKO] Keiichi! Sonozaki's
on the phone for you!

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.586
[KEIICHI]
Got it!

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:40.757
Hey. If you're calling me in for
club stuff, do it without me.

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:43.844
[SHION]
Um, pardon me. I'm not...

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:46.346
I'm sorry. I thought
it was Mion calling,

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:47.806
but this is Shion, isn't it?

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:49.099
[SHION]
Yes, it is.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.269
Um. Sorry to bother you,
but do you like desserts?

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.521
Yeah, it's the
best part of the meal!

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:55.730
That's good.

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:58.275
You see, Angel Mort is trying
out a new dessert menu,

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.235
and we're looking
for taste testers.

00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:02.529
Would you be willing
to help us out with that?

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:05.490
Uh, yeah, of course, but can I?

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:06.867
[SHION]
You certainly can!

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:08.285
We'll be waiting
for you tomorrow,

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:10.579
so please come to
the restaurant after school.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.038
Have a good night, Kei.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.373
You too. See you then.

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:14.499
[phone click]

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:15.542
[KEIICHI]
Man.

00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:18.670
Shion's really been going
out of her way for me, huh?

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:25.468
Well, hi there!

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.679
Welcome to Angel Mort, sir!

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:28.638
Heya, Shion.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.307
Let's get this thing going!

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:33.184
Uh... One thing: After my shift,

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.645
I was hoping I could
borrow you for a while.

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:38.064
Uh, sure, I don't
have anywhere to be.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:38.982
That should be fine.

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:41.192
Lovely. Just wait
for me here, please.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:42.777
Thank you!

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:46.615
[KEIICHI] Ohh!
These portions are huge!

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.533
And it's all amazing!

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.536
Ready to be swept up in
a sweet cyclone of flavor

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.496
with our Tropical
Cinnamon Love Affair?

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.916
Oh! I have never
been more ready!

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:57.584
[breaking glass]

00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:59.961
I demand you correct
this right nyaow!

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:02.505
[SHION] I'm terribly sorry for
getting it on your clothes, sir!

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.174
We'll make it up to you!

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:05.342
Is she okay?

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:07.135
It looks like she tripped.

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.846
If mew don't get this little
spill wiped up quickly,

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:12.807
it will surely become a
rather embarrassing stain!

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:13.683
Huh?!

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:16.519
Not quite. He made
her fall on purpose.

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:18.396
Wait, it's his fault?

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.065
[WAITRESS A]
There's not much we can do.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.942
We have to keep
our customers happy.

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:25.445
[CREEP B] Now wipe quickly,
milass, before it sets!

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.949
You think you're
real clever, huh?

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.618
Shut your mouth and get
your perv ass outta here!

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.079
[SHION]
Kei.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.289
I think you're confused, sir.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.959
She needs a lesson
in customer service.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:43.922
[KEIICHI] I'm gonna teach you
a lesson, you creepy bastard!

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.424
[SHION]
Kei!

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:54.891
This is... Where am I?

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:55.976
Thank goodness.

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:57.477
You finally woke up.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.312
Uh... I guess.

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:01.690
Nerdzilla knocked
me clean out, huh?

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.274
I hope you're all right.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.068
It's my fault this happened.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.278
I'm so sorry you were hurt.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.405
Don't say that.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:10.031
I wish I could've helped more.

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.492
I couldn't even win
the fight I started.

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:13.660
[SHION]
Mm‐mm.

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:17.288
You saw me in trouble and
came to help, and that's enough.

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:24.671
[SHION]
Thank you for waiting.

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.508
The sun will be
down before long.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.551
We should hurry!

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.052
[KEIICHI]
Whoa, wait!

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:33.054
[SHION]
Let me reintroduce myself.

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.723
My name is Shion Sonozaki.

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:36.391
I'm the younger twin,

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:38.935
but Mion can act rather
coarse and overbearing,

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:41.438
whereas I try to be
more mature and refined.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.231
[KEIICHI]
So she's talked about me?

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:44.899
What kind of things
has she told you?

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:46.651
[SHION]
She's talked about the club.

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:49.654
You getting one over on her,
her getting you right back.

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:52.490
It seems you've
grown quite close.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:53.575
Look at these.

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.243
They're beautiful, aren't they?

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.996
[KEIICHI]
Yeah. They really are.

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:02.959
Hey now, there's no need
to act so melodramatic!

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.252
Surely you couldn't
be so bashful

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:07.213
that you're too nervous to link
arms with a girl, could you?

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:08.715
What?! No, I'm not nervous!

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:09.966
Don't be ridiculous!

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:12.177
If you really need an arm
to hold onto that badly,

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.428
then take one.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.929
I'm fine.

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:17.474
Well, you've
certainly never failed

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:20.685
to entertain me so far, Kei.

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:23.938
Honestly, some of the
softer aspects of Mion

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.815
don't sit very well with me.

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:28.943
I'm guessing that means the two
of you don't really get along?

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.362
Oh, we get along
just fine in general.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.907
But it's these
few particular things

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:36.701
that tend to rub me
the wrong way.

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:41.289
‐‐[SHION gasps]
‐‐[KEIICHI]Huh?

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:44.209
[SHION]
Look at these!

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.752
They're so cute!

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:47.295
[KEIICHI]
This place.

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:50.757
[SHION]
Hey, Kei. If I asked you,

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:54.344
would you buy me a doll?

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:56.054
Yeah, why not?

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.555
After all, we're already here,

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:00.600
and I owe you one
for helping me.

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:06.648
You want that one?

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:08.066
You don't have to.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:11.152
Her dress is utterly adorable,
but she does cost quite a bit.

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:12.987
[KEIICHI]
I'm not worried about the price.

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.739
It's what you asked for.

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:17.826
Excuse me!

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:18.910
I was hoping I could buy

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:21.246
that doll in the window
with the pink dress.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:25.583
[MION]
Yes, sir! Let me get‐‐

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:26.584
Mion?

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.503
Wait, Kei? And that's...

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.839
What the hell
are you doing here?

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:34.384
[SHION] As I've been
telling you since we met,

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:35.969
my name is Shion.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.346
I'm Mion Sonozaki's sister.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:39.931
You've been calling me that.

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:42.600
It's strange you're acting
so surprised to hear it again.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.144
But I, uh...

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:45.603
Stop ignoring me, Shion!

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:48.398
Hurry up and tell me
why you're here already!

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:48.773
Oh, no reason!

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.525
I was simply taking
the opportunity

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:53.153
to get acquainted with
this boy Kei, and here we are.

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:53.945
Hold on.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:56.197
Mion, weren't you the one
who called me yesterday?

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:58.116
Why would I have
called you yesterday?

00:10:58.158 --> 00:10:59.576
What are you talking about?

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:01.119
You may recall I was
the one who showed up

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:03.830
at your door with
food the other night too!

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:04.539
Hey!

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:05.665
I did that one!

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:09.794
But that hardly sounds
like you, does it now, Mion?

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:11.337
Well... I...

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:14.591
Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind,
nevermind, nevermind...

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.050
[SHION]
So you see, Kei?

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.136
I really am Shion Sonozaki.

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:20.054
It's been me the whole time!

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:22.223
I hope everything
makes sense now.

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:23.516
So then, shopkeep.

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:25.852
Can we get that doll
bagged up now, please?

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:28.396
It's my first big present
from my sweetheart,

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:30.732
and I'm ready to take it home!

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:45.038
Ah! That's nice!

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:46.206
Huh?

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.919
Hey, Rika! Keep it up!

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.756
Nii! Let's both give it
our best this year, okay?

00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:57.175
It's wonderful to see Rika
becoming so confident

00:11:57.217 --> 00:12:00.303
about her role in
the festival this year.

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:05.183
Puttin' your back into it, Kei?

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.352
Yeah! Let's do our best!

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:18.780
Man, I'm tired.

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.490
[SHION]
Good job, Kei.

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:22.533
Ah, thanks, Mion.

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:23.660
Whoa, hold on!

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:27.163
It's me, I'm the
thoughtful sister, Shion.

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.206
Why you!

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:29.749
[laughs]

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:33.211
I didn't have anything to do
with you getting us mixed up.

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:36.214
No fair making a good point.

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:40.301
[MION screams]

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:41.427
Hey, Shion!

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:44.514
What are you doing following
Kei around like that again?

00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:47.058
[SHION] Showing consideration
for the people around me.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.685
Quite a concept, I know.

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:52.397
And on that note, why exactly
are you holding two barley teas?

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:56.150
Oh, well. I'm, uh... See...

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:59.153
Yeah! One barley tea's
not enough for me!

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.406
What a talented girl.

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:03.449
You drained those quite quickly!

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:04.867
You suck, Shion.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:07.370
You sucked yesterday,
and you suck even more now!

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:08.746
[laughs]

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.331
[shutter click]

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:15.086
Good evening.

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:19.424
Oh hey, old man Tomitake
and Ms. Takano showed up too!

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:20.883
[TAKANO]
Is that you, Shion?

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:23.594
What a pleasant surprise
to run into you out here!

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:26.431
Good to see you again, ma'am.

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:28.599
[TOMITAKE] And you must be
the new kid in town.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.101
Keiichi Maebara, right?

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:33.646
Uh, yeah. Sorry,
but have I met you before?

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:35.732
I'm glad you recognize my face.

00:13:35.773 --> 00:13:36.524
We haven't talked,

00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:38.901
but we've passed each
other on the road before.

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:41.279
I'm Tomitake,
a freelance photographer

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:42.822
working out of Tokyo.

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:45.158
Now, I don't suppose
you recognize me?

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:48.453
Uh, yeah, sorry. I got nothing.

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:49.746
She's Miyo Takano.

00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:52.623
She's been a nurse over
at the clinic for a while now.

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:54.917
Ask for me next time
you get a checkup.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.670
I'll make sure all my biggest
needles are ready for you.

00:13:57.712 --> 00:14:00.048
Evening, ladies and gentlemen.

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:02.633
Detective Ooishi! How are you?

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.178
Scoping things out
for security tomorrow?

00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:07.972
[OOISHI laughs]
Guess I'm not hiding it well.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:11.142
Ah, and it seems
Mister Tomitake is here.

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:12.643
It's been a while, hasn't it?

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:15.396
Well, I'm honored that you
would remember my name, sir.

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:16.856
Good to see you!

00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:20.693
Seems like you've gotten pretty
attached to Hinamizawa, huh?

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:23.905
Anyway. You folks
have a good year.

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:25.281
Oh, Detective?

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:27.992
Everyone's counting
on you and your team.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:30.703
We're all hoping we can get
through the Watanagashi Festival

00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:32.747
without incident this year.

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:34.540
[OOISHI]
Tall order, but I'll try!

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.793
[laughs]

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:40.254
The curse of
Lord Oyashiro, right?

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:41.589
[MION]
Hey, Kei.

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:42.131
[KEIICHI]
Huh?

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:43.925
I'm hungry. Let's get some food.

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:45.218
They've got plenty
of free snacks

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:46.761
over at the volunteer tent.

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:48.721
Sure. Sounds good.

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:49.931
[MION]
Let's go!

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:53.684
So who's going to die this year,
and who is going to disappear?

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:55.728
Wha...?

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.688
Wait a sec, what'd you say?

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:02.151
[cicada cries]

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:04.153
Nothing interesting.

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:05.822
Let's go, Kei.

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:09.909
You really haven't
brought it up with him yet?

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:12.245
It seems like everyone else
knows what's going on,

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:14.622
so would someone
mind filling me in?

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.919
[MION] Well, I'm heading
on to the snack tent.

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:23.297
Fair warning, if you take too
long I'm eating your share too.

00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:26.175
Uh... Got it, thanks.

00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:36.144
Now then, do you believe in the
power of curses, Mister Maebara?

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:36.894
Huh?

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:40.148
You've heard about the
Hinamizawa Dam project, right?

00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:42.066
Yeah.

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:44.318
[TOMITAKE] When the villagers
were holding their protests,

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.530
they used Oyashiro's shrine here
as their base of operations.

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:49.323
The idea was that working
under the protection

00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:50.700
of their guardian deity,

00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:52.493
they'd be blessed with victory.

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:55.204
It was only superstition,
of course.

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:57.248
That's how it started.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.083
But then something happened.

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:01.127
[KEIICHI] By something,
you mean the curse?

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:05.173
[SHION] The construction manager
for the Hinamizawa Dam project

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:07.925
was brutally murdered.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:10.761
He was attacked by
a mob armed with pickaxes.

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:13.055
They killed him and
dismembered the body

00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:15.099
and disposed of it in pieces.

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:17.226
[TOMITAKE]
One of the attackers escaped.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:19.312
He remains missing to this day,

00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:21.606
along with the
victim's right arm.

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:22.940
[TAKANO]
The following year,

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.318
a couple who had been
in favor of the dam project

00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:27.737
suffered a deadly fall
from a cliff.

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:31.199
The man's body was found,
but the wife never was.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.034
[SHION] The year after that,
the shrine priest,

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:35.203
who had been on
the side of the protesters,

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:37.455
suddenly came down
with a mysterious illness

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:38.748
and passed away.

00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:41.167
They found a suicide
note from his wife.

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:43.169
She disappeared,
as if to join him.

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:45.546
[TOMITAKE] And the next year,
which was last year,

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:47.882
the wife of the
younger brother of the man

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:50.718
who'd fallen off the cliff
was found out in the woods.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.221
Apparently beaten to death.

00:16:53.262 --> 00:16:55.348
But what's most
interesting about all this.

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:56.974
Is that each and
every one of these deaths

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:58.851
and disappearances
happened to take place

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:01.521
during the night of the
Watanagashi festival.

00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:02.605
[gasps]

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:05.566
[TAKANO] Everyone involved with
the dam project is dying off,

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:06.901
one by one.

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:09.695
And the terrified people
of Hinamizawa attribute it

00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:13.032
to the curse of Lord Oyashiro.

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:15.618
So what do you think, Keiichi?

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.620
I definitely don't
believe it was a curse

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:18.996
that did those things.

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:22.291
But I can see why people prefer
it to no explanation at all.

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:23.417
That's good.

00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:26.462
I knew I could count on you to
look at things rationally, Kei.

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:30.132
So if it's not a curse, and it's
clearly not a coincidence.

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.300
Well, then,

00:17:31.342 --> 00:17:35.096
I suppose we can only wait and
see what comes next, can't we?

00:17:35.137 --> 00:17:36.097
Huh?

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:37.431
She has her own theory.

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:39.850
Ms. Takano says
there's some person or group

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:41.185
of people behind it all.

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:42.812
Nothing else makes sense.

00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:44.188
There's no way these things
could've happened

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.607
unless somebody
orchestrated them, right?

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:48.734
[SHION] And we have proof
that Lord Oyashiro's curse

00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:51.862
has something to do with the
people of Hinamizawa themselves.

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:54.782
[KEIICHI] Wha... What
do you mean by proof?

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:58.452
Every year someone gets killed
and someone else disappears.

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:02.248
[KEIICHI] Disappears?
Like they just vanish?

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.167
Hinamizawa shows up
in legends from ancient times.

00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:06.210
They say the people
of the village

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:08.045
would offer human sacrifices

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:10.506
to quell the wrath
of Lord Oyashiro.

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:12.174
[KEIICHI]
Human sacrifices?

00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:13.301
Yes.

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:15.094
They'd roll them up
in bamboo mats

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:16.971
and toss them into the swamp,

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:20.141
then leave them to
sink slowly to their deaths.

00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:22.393
Awful, isn't it?
[laughs]

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:23.978
[KEIICHI]
What are you trying to say?

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.521
You think the people
who disappeared

00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:29.150
were offered up as human
sacrifices to Oyashiro?

00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:32.153
[SHION] Lord Oyashiro takes one
life in the name of the curse.

00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:35.114
But each year,
there also has to be a second.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:37.033
One given by the villagers.

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:39.452
[KEIICHI] But, Shion,
if that's true, then...

00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:42.204
...somebody in Hinamizawa
is behind it all!

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:53.883
[SHION] This year's Watanagashi
festival is coming up tomorrow.

00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:56.010
I certainly don't
want anyone to die,

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:59.096
or to disappear,
for that matter.

00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:03.976
[KEIICHI]
So it's tomorrow?

00:19:04.018 --> 00:19:07.229
[TAKANO] And who do you
suppose it will be, tomorrow?

00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:09.940
Who will die and
who will disappear?

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:19.283
[RENA]
Ahh!

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.035
Everything looks so nice!

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:22.453
They knew the whole
village was coming,

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:23.996
so they had to get it right!

00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:25.164
That's impressive.

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:28.125
Ah! Hey,
I found Rika and Satoko!

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:30.503
Over here!

00:19:30.544 --> 00:19:31.462
Well now!

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:33.589
My lovely friends are here!

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.299
Evening, darlings!

00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:37.426
Good evening.

00:19:37.468 --> 00:19:39.470
Awoo! Rika!

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:40.888
Can I keep you please?

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.181
Mii!

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.974
Ready for your performance?

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:48.020
I'm a little nervous,
to be honest.

00:19:48.062 --> 00:19:48.729
Don't be.

00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:50.022
You'll blow 'em away!

00:19:50.064 --> 00:19:52.775
And we're gonna be out
there cheering you on, okay?

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:54.068
So give it your all!

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.070
[ALL]
You got this!

00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:57.947
Eheh!

00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:05.746
Seems like I lost
everybody somehow.

00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:11.460
Man, I can't even see her!

00:20:11.502 --> 00:20:13.045
[SHION]
Hey, Kei!

00:20:13.087 --> 00:20:14.296
Come along, please.

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:15.840
Okay.

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.383
Wait, what's going on?

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:20.010
Why are you taking me
away from the festival?

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:23.597
[SHION] Shh! It's fine,
just stay quiet and follow me.

00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:27.226
Here we are.
Take a look out there.

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:35.860
What, is that it?

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.820
You dragged me out here
to look at a building?

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:38.738
Indeed, I did.

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:40.114
I thought you were trying
to take me someplace

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:42.616
we could actually see Rika!

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.577
You are very hung up on that.

00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:46.537
I can't think of a
nicer way to say this,

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:49.039
but your taste in women
is looking suspect.

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:51.208
Wow. I think I'll head back.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.961
[TAKANO]
Gracious, what's all this about?

00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:54.962
Keiichi!

00:20:55.004 --> 00:20:57.882
What a surprise running
into you all the way out here.

00:20:57.923 --> 00:20:59.759
In the bushes
with a girl, at that.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.302
[laughs]

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:03.846
[SHION] I had assumed that was
why you two were out here.

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:05.306
You were peeping on us?

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:06.182
Well, sorry to tell you,

00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:07.725
but you won't be
getting the kind of show

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:09.852
you were hoping for, dear.

00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:13.355
[SHION] Hmm... Then what
were you up to, exactly?

00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:15.983
Oh, y'know,
just a little break‐in.

00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:17.193
Don't tell, okay?

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:18.903
[KEIICHI]
Whaddya mean "don't tell"?

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:20.696
Were you trying
to steal something?

00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:24.992
No. We just wanna get
a quick look at what's inside.

00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:26.702
[TAKANO]
Mm‐hm...

00:21:26.744 --> 00:21:29.955
This is a forbidden storehouse
for old ritual tools.

00:21:29.997 --> 00:21:32.416
Only a few people outside
the Furude family

00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:33.876
are allowed inside.

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:35.503
If anyone else were to enter,

00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:37.963
they would be defiling
a sacred space.

00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:38.839
[KEIICHI]
Okay.

00:21:38.881 --> 00:21:41.217
So why are you guys
trying to break into it?

00:21:41.258 --> 00:21:44.178
Because I'm far too curious
to let superstition keep me

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.889
from finding out what
they've hidden in here!

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:48.849
[TOMITAKE]
It's open.

00:21:48.891 --> 00:21:51.685
[TAKANO]
Thank you! It's finally time.

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:55.064
So? You two are
accessories to the crime.

00:21:55.105 --> 00:21:57.608
No reason not to take
a look now, is there?

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.360
Wha... Hey, wait a minute.

00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:00.736
We're just standing here!

00:22:00.778 --> 00:22:02.655
That sounds interesting!

00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:04.406
Kei. Let's go.

00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:07.368
But... I thought nobody
was supposed to go in there.

00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:09.537
It's a sacred place, isn't it?

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:12.832
I don't know exactly what tools
are kept in that storehouse.

00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:16.627
But I am a Sonozaki,
so I do have some idea.

00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:19.839
And I think it's best if
you see them for yourself.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.424
You want me
to see what's inside?

00:22:22.466 --> 00:22:24.009
I dunno.

00:22:25.219 --> 00:22:26.303
[SHION] If you don't
find anything in there

00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:29.515
that interests you,
you're welcome to leave.

00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:30.808
But I think you
will find something

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.643
to hold your attention.

00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:37.022
Or does the curse frighten you?

00:22:37.064 --> 00:22:38.274
[KEIICHI]
No way.

00:22:38.315 --> 00:22:40.067
There's no such
thing as a curse.

00:22:40.109 --> 00:22:42.945
[TOMITAKE] I'm gonna
stay here and keep a lookout.

00:22:42.987 --> 00:22:45.030
You two go ahead
and take a look inside.

00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:46.198
For a young guy like yourself,

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.992
I'm guessing there'll be
a lot of interesting stuff

00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:49.702
to check out.

00:22:52.288 --> 00:22:52.955
[KEIICHI]
Fine.

00:22:52.997 --> 00:22:56.041
Just a quick peek,
but I'm going back if it's lame.

00:22:56.083 --> 00:22:57.877
[SHION]
That's all I wanted!

00:23:01.589 --> 00:23:03.215
So you've made your choice then.

00:23:03.257 --> 00:23:04.925
Let's take a look.

00:23:52.723 --> 00:23:56.185
[RIKA] Next time:
<i>Watadamashi‐hen</i>, Part 3.
