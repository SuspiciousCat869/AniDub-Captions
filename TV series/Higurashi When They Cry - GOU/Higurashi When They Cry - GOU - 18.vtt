[chuckles]

00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:23.607
I'm not sure how, but it
looks like you missed us.

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:24.566
No way.

00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:26.068
This doesn't make sense.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.655
I... I was shooting at you
from point‐blank range!

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:32.991
Let go!

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.952
‐‐[BLOODHOUND B] Stop!
‐‐[BLOODHOUND D] Quit resisting!

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:35.953
[TAKANO]
Don't you dare!

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:37.329
Don't step on that!

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:40.958
[BLOODHOUND E]
Major Takano.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.834
We're putting you under arrest.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.336
[TAKANO]
Of course.

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:47.589
You're going to have me
take the fall for everything.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:01:01.562
[sobs]

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:02.896
[BLOODHOUND D]
Get up! Enough already.

00:01:02.938 --> 00:01:04.231
Put your hands behind your back!

00:01:04.273 --> 00:01:06.066
No! Don't do this to me.

00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:07.359
Let me go!

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.027
My grandpa's scrapbook!

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.112
Give it to me!

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:11.947
Hey! Dammit, stop struggling!

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:14.074
Please. You can't!

00:01:14.116 --> 00:01:15.909
[BLOODHOUND E]
Freeze!

00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:19.913
[TOMITAKE] Stop! Lieutenant
Jiro Tomitake, with research.

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:21.832
I'll be taking custody
of this suspect.

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:24.167
[BLOODHOUND B]
But, sir, our orders from HQ

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.545
were to return the
Major to Tokyo directly.

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:27.713
And in the state she's in,

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.464
you think she would
survive the trip?

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:32.175
Her body is covered
in scratches!

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:33.552
That's a late‐stage symptom.

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:36.513
She has Hinamizawa Syndrome,
and it's killing her!

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.932
[gasps]

00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:41.268
[BLOODHOUND B] But, sir,
that shouldn't be possible.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.854
Major Takano was inoculated
with a preventative serum

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:45.731
before she took this post.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.567
And did you bother to read
that serum's documentation?

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.485
We already knew
that it's not effective

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:53.989
in 100 percent of cases!

00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:56.283
She's our only real lead on
what's happening here,

00:01:56.325 --> 00:01:58.452
but we won't get
anything useful out of her

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:00.120
if she's dead or delusional.

00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:01.413
There are unknowns.

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:03.874
We can't assume she
was acting on her own will.

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:05.375
It's possible someone
else was using

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:07.461
her weakened state
to control her.

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.588
We can't know for sure
unless we treat her.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.215
That's our duty,
and it's her right!

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.718
You're protecting me.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.679
[TOMITAKE] Transport the Major
to the Irie Clinic right away!

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.473
Tell Lieutenant Colonel Irie
that we need him

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:22.225
to prepare a treatment at once!

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.279
Jiro, please.

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:35.989
Please help me!

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:40.702
[sobs]

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:42.454
[TOMITAKE]
Sorry I'm late.

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:43.872
It's all over now.

00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:46.541
[TAKANO sobs]

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:47.459
[TOMITAKE]
I know you're not really

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:49.628
the evil person
you think you are.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.922
You can still start anew.

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:55.133
Live a new life as the
person you were before.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.594
The life that Miyoko
Tanashi deserved.

00:02:57.636 --> 00:02:58.804
The life you had lost.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.723
[TAKANO sobs]

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:02.891
I can't.

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:04.393
I have no right.

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:08.480
I can't shrug off
the weight of my sins!

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:11.525
I don't deserve
to be free of them.

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:15.987
If I try to leave them,
they'll consume me.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.825
Maybe, but I'll be there
with you. Always.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:20.992
I'll remain by your side

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.620
and help carry
the weight of those sins.

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:27.124
Is it right...
for me to keep living?

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:28.625
After all I've done,

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.794
should I be allowed
to be part of this world?

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:31.962
It's not for me to say whether

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:33.422
or not the world
will forgive you

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:34.881
for everything you've done.

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.842
But I know I can forgive you.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.176
And as long
as you're still alive.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:41.096
You can make things
right and start again.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:52.899
[HANYUU]
It's enough.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:55.777
I could never have hoped
for a greater miracle than this.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.697
But is it really worth the
suffering you've had to endure?

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.992
I can't imagine this
alone makes up for it all.

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:05.370
Uh... Hey, guys.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:06.997
Doesn't the
festival kick off soon?

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:08.832
Yeah! I'm so excited!

00:04:08.874 --> 00:04:11.918
[MION] Hmm... And Watanagashi
gives us the perfect opportunity

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.879
to get our rookie nice
and broken in!

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.047
But I don't wanna be broken in!

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.924
You have many penalties ahead.

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:19.843
Poor, poor, pitiful Hanyuu!

00:04:19.885 --> 00:04:23.764
Ohh! But this year, I can
finally do more than just watch!

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.266
You've seen the Watanagashi
festival plenty of times,

00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:29.853
but now you can join
the fun in person!

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:31.980
[SATOKO] From here on,
no matter what happens.

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:34.816
We won't ever let anything
come between us, right?

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:36.860
Yes, no matter what happens.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:31.391
[SATOKO]
Rika!

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.267
If we don't leave soon,

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:33.643
we're going to have
to run full speed

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:35.228
the whole way to school!

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.147
[RIKA]
Coming!

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:41.651
That you for waiting for me!

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.533
[SATOKO] As much as I appreciate
Mion giving us her old uniforms,

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:50.994
I still haven't quite
gotten used to them.

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:53.371
[yawns]

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.457
Come now, Rika,
not when you're out in public.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:58.335
Did you not get a proper
amount of sleep last night?

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.462
I'm honestly still pretty tired.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:03.381
[SATOKO] It seems you've had
a lot of late nights recently.

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:05.842
What exactly have
you been doing?

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:07.886
[RIKA] I'm sure you'll
laugh when I tell you,

00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:10.096
so I'm going
to save it for later.

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.349
A secret you can't
even share with me?

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.060
I promise you, I'll share it
once the time is right.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.354
Ni‐paa!

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:20.065
[CHIE]
Good morning to all of you.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.900
Class rep, if you will?

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:23.526
Everyone, stand!

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:30.617
Wow, Rena.

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:32.118
How does your cooking
keep getting better

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.620
when it was so good already?

00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:36.331
I can practically taste
those sides just by looking!

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:38.041
Do they honestly look that good?

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:38.875
Do they?

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:39.668
[KEIICHI]
Yeah!

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.212
The shrimp and fried chicken
are perfectly crispy,

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:45.465
but what's even more
impressive is the hamburg st‐‐

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:46.591
[gasps]

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.426
[chortles]

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:51.304
Surely you know better than to
let your guard down around me!

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:52.806
Satoko, you little brat!

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:55.684
Didn't anybody ever teach you
to respect your elders?

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:58.812
You have no one to blame
but yourself for this.

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:01.731
I believe I just told you
to keep your guard up.

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:03.775
Smug little...

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:06.486
Don't let her under
your skin, Keiichi Maebara.

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:08.071
There's enough
food for all of us,

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:09.489
so you'll be fine
no matter how much

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:11.491
Satoko grabs from
under your nose!

00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:14.035
Well, you have a point.

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:14.911
It's all good.

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:17.247
Not like I'm gonna
go hungry, anyway.

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:19.833
[SATOKO]
That was anticlimactic.

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:20.750
I have to say,

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:23.545
that class rep position
has taken the edge off you.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.213
It's still hard to
get used to the idea

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:27.340
that Keiichi is
our class rep now.

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:28.800
[giggles]

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:31.177
Well, it was Mion
for the longest time!

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.849
I'm having a hard time
getting used to it, too.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.560
Now that she's graduated,
we barely see her anymore.

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.395
You talk like she
moved cross‐country.

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:42.897
She's a stone's throw
away in Okinomiya.

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.775
If you miss her so badly,
you should go visit her!

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:47.527
[KEIICHI] I thought
about going to see her.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.988
But you know Mion.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.991
She immediately started a
Game Club at her new school,

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:56.745
and it seems like that's been
taking up a lot of her time.

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:01.833
And the fact that we
knew it would happen

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:04.711
doesn't make it hurt any less.

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:06.629
I think growing up in
this little village school

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:09.299
is different from
how it is for most kids.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.593
They all go to schools
that are split up by year,

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:14.304
and each year is split into
more than one class,

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:16.014
so they're more used to
not seeing all their friends

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:19.642
when the new school year starts.

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:20.769
Probably.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.896
But just because Mion
has been making new friends

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:25.774
doesn't mean she's forgotten
about us or anything, right?

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:28.151
Being a member of
our club is a trial by fire,

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:29.903
and the bonds forged
through our activities

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:32.447
are far too strong
to break as easily as that!

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:34.240
[KEIICHI]
And it's not just us.

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:36.326
This club would never have
come together without Mion,

00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:38.536
and we owe it to her to
make sure it can keep going

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:41.206
after we're gone,
the same way she did for us.

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:45.168
[RENA]
Right.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.462
[KEIICHI]
On that note,

00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:49.964
as President of
this illustrious club,

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:52.592
I call upon our daring
combatants to gather!

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:53.927
Yes, sir!

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:54.803
Uh...

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:57.263
Are you the only
ones here today?

00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:58.848
[GIRL B]
Guys?

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.850
We wanna play, too,
if that's okay.

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:03.228
Sure! We'd love to have you!

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.772
That'll help, the group
is still small though.

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:08.566
I think that's 'cause
Watanagashi is coming up.

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.026
A lot of our classmates
have to go home

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:12.278
and watch their houses so
their parents can go help out

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.405
with the festival preparations.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.448
[KEIICHI]
Oh, I gotcha.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.617
That makes sense.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:19.119
[SATOKO]
Keiichi.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.121
Would you care to explain?

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:23.581
I just figured the first game
should be simple.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.333
Even our newest
members should be able

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.627
to play a game of
concentration, right?

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:30.088
I'm not taking issue with
your choice of game here.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.091
My concern is that you
opened a fresh pack of cards!

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:34.551
Is something wrong with them?

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:36.427
[SATOKO]
No, they're completely pristine,

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:39.389
so we can't tell what they
are till we turn them over!

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.141
Come on.
There's no point in playing

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.017
unless you play
by the rules, Satoko.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:45.019
In fact, I'll make
"always play fair"

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.564
the club's new rule number two!

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:50.817
Who told you that
you could pat my head?

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:51.985
[KEIICHI]
You're not scared you can't win

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:54.737
unless you play dirty,
are you, Satoko?

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:55.864
Are you?

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.158
I'm afraid you're getting
your hopes up for nothing.

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:00.535
You'll see that my already
formidable memory

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:02.787
has only gotten
sharper with time.

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:08.376
Now where could
the other six have been?

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.003
It's not over yet, Satoko!

00:11:10.044 --> 00:11:12.755
It's one of the ones
Okamura flipped last turn!

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:14.215
[SATOKO growls]

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.509
This one. Right here!

00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:22.473
[KEIICHI]
And Tomita wins!

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:24.517
It was all just luck, honestly.

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.269
[KEIICHI]
And the loser is...

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:28.188
You couldn't even
match a single pair,

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.315
you poor, poor pitiful thing.

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:32.901
I refuse to count this
as a legitimate loss!

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:35.403
I don't know how,
but somebody cheated!

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:38.239
Anyway, why don't we
move on to the next game?

00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:40.867
[RIKA]
Sorry, everybody.

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:43.453
It was fun, but it's time
for me to go home.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.624
Right. You've gotta work on
your big dance for the festival!

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:49.125
Yes, exactly.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:52.420
Swinging that big hoe,
going "hi‐yah" really loud.

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.088
It's super hard work!

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.673
See you all later!

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:59.052
[KEIICHI] Oh, well,
you gotta do what you gotta do!

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.265
[RIKA] Just because I ditched
the meeting didn't mean

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.559
you had to leave too, Satoko.

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:08.186
[SATOKO] I'm a bit curious
as to why you would lie

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:09.979
to our classmates like that.

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:12.232
You don't really
have practice today.

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:13.399
Yeah. I know.

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.443
Well, I can certainly
understand why

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:16.903
you would want to leave early.

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:18.738
What's the fun in a
game of concentration

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.531
when you play it straight?

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:23.201
I should have guessed
that you'd see right through me.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.412
You're right, the idea of
playing an honest game

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:29.540
with my classmates just
isn't terribly appealing.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.709
I was a pure soul
like that, once,

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.295
but your guerilla tactics
hardened my heart.

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:37.215
My soul is stained
as black as yours now.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.675
Ni‐paa!

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:41.928
And it wasn't easy,
but you were worth it.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.888
[RIKA] Rena and Keiichi are
the ones all our classmates

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.724
look up to the most.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.142
They do things
differently than Mion,

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:50.144
so it's only natural that
the club is different

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:51.938
with them in charge.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.190
[SATOKO] And to their credit,
they've done a wonderful job

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:57.193
of getting more of our
classmates to take part.

00:12:57.235 --> 00:13:01.281
Which I can certainly
appreciate, but still,

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:04.951
I refuse to abide by this
"always playing fair" nonsense!

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:07.578
My talent for dirty trickery is
one of my greatest assets,

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.372
and I will not
let it wither away!

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:10.999
Then you'll need to
keep your skills sharp

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.959
by pranking Keiichi non‐stop.

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.460
Yes, that'll be perfect!

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:17.046
I'll bury him under
a hailstorm of washtubs!

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:18.131
How sad.

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:19.590
Poor, pitiful Keiichi
is going to have

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.844
a flat spot on
the top of his skull.

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:25.596
[laughter]

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:29.183
[SATOKO] Hinamizawa really
has changed over the past year.

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:31.728
It seems like we
all have, doesn't it?

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:32.812
But it's for the best

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:35.064
that everything doesn't
stay the same, right?

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:37.650
I understand it's a good thing,
but it's a little sad knowing

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:40.236
it'll never be how
it was before.

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:54.959
[IRIE]
This is troubling.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:56.169
Alarming, in fact.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.253
Huh?!

00:13:57.295 --> 00:13:58.087
What's wrong?

00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:59.422
Is it getting worse?

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:00.965
It's a step backward!

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:02.800
I knew from the outset
that a maid uniform

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:05.428
would suit you far better
than the school uniform,

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.389
both aesthetically and
functionally, and I was right.

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:12.685
If only I could have convinced
Ms. Sonozaki to see reason!

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:15.063
I'm with her
for what it's worth.

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:15.897
Irie.

00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:18.149
I believe you have the
results of Satoko's checkup

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:19.525
if you'd like to share.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:20.985
Yes, of course.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:22.945
I beg your pardon.

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:24.072
As we've established,

00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:26.407
the treatment has proven
to be highly effective.

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.700
Satoko's Hinamizawa Syndrome

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:31.245
has improved quite dramatically
in the course of the past year.

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:34.040
Well, that's because I've always
had you here to support me.

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:36.501
I can never thank you enough
for all that you've done.

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:38.878
I remember having to give
myself three injections a day,

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.171
and through your hard work,

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:42.173
that's gone all
the way down to one.

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:43.091
[IRIE]
As of this visit,

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:45.426
we're safe to cut that
number down to zero.

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:46.260
Sorry?

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:47.387
Are you saying that...?

00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:50.390
[IRIE] Your test came
back completely negative.

00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:51.349
I was skeptical,

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:53.726
so I went ahead and
ran multiple follow‐ups.

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:54.769
I would never tell you this

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:59.148
if I wasn't entirely
confident in its accuracy.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.900
But I am.

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:03.903
It appears your Hinamizawa
Syndrome is gone.

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:05.655
Wait, it's completely cured?

00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:06.864
You're saying
it's gone for good,

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.492
and it won't ever come back?

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:10.952
[IRIE] I'd still like
to run one more test

00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:12.829
out of an abundance of caution,

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.915
but that seems to be the case.

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:18.876
I've been waiting so long
to hear you say that!

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:26.092
[IRIE]
Rika?

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:26.926
Huh?

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:28.803
I've gotten Satoko's results.

00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:30.346
She's perfectly healthy.

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:31.806
But how is that possible?

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:32.765
I thought you told me

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:35.643
late‐stage Hinamizawa
Syndrome is incurable.

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:37.228
You said the symptoms
could be suppressed,

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.731
but that the patients carry
the disease with them for life.

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:41.774
Yes, I did.

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:42.900
It's hard to explain,

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.902
but it seems some
unknown factor relating

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.447
to the underlying cause
of the disease has shifted.

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:51.200
In fact, all of my Hinamizawa
Syndrome patients

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:54.537
have shown dramatic improvements
similar to Satoko's.

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:56.664
That's been the pattern
throughout the last year.

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.499
That's when it started?

00:15:58.541 --> 00:15:59.709
Do you have some
theory regarding

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.462
what might have caused this?

00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:04.797
[RIKA]
I could hardly even guess.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.340
Ni‐paa!

00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:14.765
A certain someone's faith
in humanity was restored

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:17.268
after being lost
a thousand years.

00:16:25.526 --> 00:16:27.361
[KIMIYOSHI] It's such a rare
thing these days for the heads

00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:29.780
of the three families
to meet like this.

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:32.533
Seems like we hardly
ever get the chance.

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:34.994
Everyone in the village'd
get their knickers in a twist

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.913
seein' us here like this.

00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:37.788
[chuckles]

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.332
I suppose it's for
the best that it's just

00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:42.251
the three of us here,
no prying eyes.

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:43.169
On that note,

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:45.838
what do we need
to talk about, Miss Rika?

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.548
Thank you for agreeing to meet.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.592
I was hoping to ask a favor.

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:52.303
[ORYO]
Then ask it, girl, it's late.

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:54.972
There's something I'd
like to do at the festival.

00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:01.854
[KIMIYOSHI]
Makes perfect sense to me.

00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:03.523
All right, I'm with you.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:08.236
For the sake of the village,
it needs to be done.

00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:10.446
It takes a bit of
weight off us old folks,

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:12.031
but it also stops our burdens

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.325
from weighing down
these youngsters.

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:17.954
I got no objections.

00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:20.915
Only having me and
Kimiyoshi won't be enough.

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:23.834
We need you to be
a part of this, Oryo.

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:26.170
How about it?

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:27.964
No objections here.

00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:30.258
You do as the spirit moves you.

00:18:14.802 --> 00:18:16.846
We should start making
our way to the river.

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:18.389
Yeah, let's go.

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.141
[drumbeats]

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:22.768
[MAN A]
The Mayor?

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.061
[MAN B]
Hold on a minute.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.771
Is that Oryo?

00:18:27.815 --> 00:18:30.192
Why're the heads of the
three families up on stage?

00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:31.944
‐‐[WOMAN] Weird.
‐‐[MAN C] What's going on?

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:35.031
[KIMIYOSHI] Could I have
your attention, please?

00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:37.074
We know you're ready
for the cotton drifting,

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:40.119
so we're going to try and
keep this as brief as possible.

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:41.746
I'm sure everyone
remembers the fight

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:45.458
that raged in Hinamizawa
just a few years ago.

00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:46.459
That's right.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.961
I mean the Dam War.

00:18:49.003 --> 00:18:51.839
We fought to save
the village, and we won.

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:54.508
But our community was wounded,
and even to this day,

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.802
those wounds
haven't fully healed.

00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:59.013
Sometimes the scars reopen.

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:02.183
Some of us kept taking
hits after the fight was done.

00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:05.728
Lord Oyashiro
has seen us hurting,

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.105
and he feels our pain, too.

00:19:09.523 --> 00:19:10.483
[KIMIYOSHI]
We must change,

00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:13.527
or those wounds are liable
to bleed this village dry.

00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:14.695
Us old folks can't leave

00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:17.073
the next generation
to deal with this.

00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:20.159
We spoke with Oryo about it,
and she agrees with us.

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:22.328
[murmuring]

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:23.871
Oryo approved this?

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:24.830
[KIMIYOSHI]
So!

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:26.707
On my authority
as village mayor,

00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:29.210
I officially absolve
all parties of

00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:31.629
any and all involvement
in the Dam War.

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:32.755
Huh?

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:36.592
[CROWD chattering]

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:38.678
[RIKA] I'm sure you've
all heard the stories.

00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:41.055
Tales of the wrath
of Lord Oyashiro.

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:44.684
Some say he curses those who
trespass on his territory,

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:46.560
while others claim
that he curses villagers

00:19:46.602 --> 00:19:48.229
who choose to leave home.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.815
But not one of the stories
you've heard is true.

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:54.151
Lord Oyashiro watches over
us for our own protection.

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:55.569
And now he can rest at last,

00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:57.905
knowing we're better
than we were.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.285
Lord Oyashiro chose Miss Rika

00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:06.372
to be his messenger
here in this world.

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:07.373
These are his words

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:10.918
from her mouth to
your ears, understand?

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:16.716
The curse from those
stories doesn't exist.

00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:18.968
Straight from the
Priestess's mouth.

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:21.929
Not much arguing
with that, is there?

00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:26.684
That's good.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:30.354
We fixed the village's sails
in time to catch a new wind.

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:53.502
[RIKA]
Satoko?

00:20:53.544 --> 00:20:55.546
What's this out of nowhere?

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.757
[RIKA]
I need to ask you a favor.

00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:00.885
Would you mind taking
a shopping trip with me?

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:03.220
You might as well
ask me the favor, first.

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.723
You know that shopping
with you is a privilege.

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.933
Sevens Mart per usual,
I'm assuming?

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:10.102
[RIKA]
Actually, no.

00:21:10.728 --> 00:21:14.190
This shopping trip is going
to be in Okinomiya.

00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:17.777
Is there a big sale at some
chain we don't have?

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:31.207
Huh, I can't
remember the last time

00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:34.210
we took a trip down
to the bookstore.

00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:37.338
Were you thinking of
getting us a new cookbook?

00:21:37.379 --> 00:21:38.923
[RIKA] There's something
I'm looking for.

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:40.007
[SATOKO]
Huh?

00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:49.600
[SATOKO]
Rika?

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:53.562
Why are you back here
looking at the study guides?

00:21:55.189 --> 00:21:57.274
Okay. What is this?

00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:58.692
Or do I have to guess?

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:00.027
For a long time now,

00:22:00.069 --> 00:22:00.986
there's a certain something

00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:03.489
I've secretly been
dreaming of doing.

00:22:07.785 --> 00:22:10.079
Rika. This is...

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.039
[RIKA]
Mm.

00:22:12.081 --> 00:22:13.666
And now I want us to make

00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:16.335
that dream come true
together, Satoko.

00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:53.223
[RIKA] Next time:
<i>Satokowashi‐hen</i>, Part two.
