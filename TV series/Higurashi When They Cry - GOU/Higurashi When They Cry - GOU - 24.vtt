00:00:21.772 --> 00:00:22.689
Has it given you some pause,

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:26.068
learning as you have that your
uncle could be so reformed?

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.153
It's confounding.

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.447
I couldn't have imagined
such a change.

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.825
And it could never have
happened if not for my power.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.536
Your memories grow stronger.

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:36.870
They accumulate
in the fragments,

00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:39.248
growing broader and deeper,
and with each new loop,

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.833
the world grows further
from what you once knew.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.586
That's quite inconvenient.

00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:45.963
In any case,

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:47.506
I think I'll be
able to get some use

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:49.841
out of this version of my uncle.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.343
Are you not concerned?

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:52.886
You appear unfazed.

00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:56.181
No, I don't imagine
my uncle becoming a hindrance.

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.267
The real issue.

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:05.691
That lies within the birdcage.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.985
With this woman, in particular.

00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:18.745
What's going on, Okonogi?

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.416
We've reached
the end of the line.

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.459
Tomitake made contact
with the Bloodhounds,

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:25.752
and now they're here.

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:26.962
[TAKANO]
The Bloodhounds?

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:29.339
Your Mountain Dogs
are spec ops too.

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:31.049
Why would you surrender
without a fight?

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.718
Is that a joke?

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.470
The Mountain Dogs are
counterintelligence.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:37.014
We're spy hunters,
and the Bloodhounds

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:39.349
are an elite combat unit.

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:42.102
They'd have our number if this
thing turned into a gunfight.

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:44.521
What is this?
Tomitake is in our custody,

00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:46.898
he shouldn't have been
able to reach them anyway.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.983
What happened?

00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:49.401
No, Major.

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:51.194
The Bloodhounds have
occupied the clinic,

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:54.865
and they set Tomitake
free when they arrived.

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:56.325
[TAKANO]
When the hell was that?

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.035
Why did nobody tell me?

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:00.162
Start talking, Okonogi!

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.332
Commander.
Priority communication.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.127
Phoenix One, over.

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:09.254
[SOLDIER C]
Final orders from Cuckoo.

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:12.090
Execute plan CUCKOO.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.717
Orders received.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.970
This is an order to all units.

00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:19.723
The command vehicle and
the clinic are compromised.

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:22.434
There will be no reinforcements
to our positions.

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.645
Cease all resistance
and surrender now.

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:26.229
[TAKANO]
What are you saying?

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:27.189
Hand over your weapons

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.691
and obey whatever
orders they give you.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:32.444
This battle is a loss
for the Mountain Dogs.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.780
It's not over!

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:38.033
Get me a line to Nomura
in Tokyo, right now!

00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:41.536
I know she could get us a unit
to fend off these Bloodhounds!

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.538
And subject R is still alive!

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.791
We can carry out
the final operation!

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.001
We just have to get
in touch with her!

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:49.378
We still have time.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.338
We can make this work Okonogi.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.255
I know it!

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:55.217
If we recover the command
vehicle, there's a chance!

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.635
[OKONOGI]
No, Major.

00:02:56.677 --> 00:03:00.639
Our final operation
has ended in failure.

00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:02.557
Our work here is done,

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.103
and you may not have
realized it, but yours is, too.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:08.271
What? Are you joking?

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.232
What the hell is going on?

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:11.650
[OKONOGI] You were assigned
to this post in hopes

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:15.153
that you'd make something
valuable out of that scrapbook.

00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:18.782
What are you doing?

00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:20.784
This scrapbook
contains the most‐‐

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:25.706
[OKONOGI] We know exactly
what it contains, Major.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:28.542
It isn't worth a damn thing
to anyone in its own right.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:30.210
What would you know about it?

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:31.128
Move your foot.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.421
Immediately!

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:34.214
[OKONOGI] Our clients
wanted to generate binders

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:35.882
full of impenetrable jargon,

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.968
and your scrapbook looks
enough like real science

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.555
that they can cite back to it,
and nobody will question it.

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:44.391
On the off chance anybody
bothers reading those reports.

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:47.519
Your research offers us
plausible deniability.

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:50.272
Stop talking and
move your damn foot.

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:52.357
[OKONOGI] Nobody gives a
shit about these mountain hicks

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.109
or their brain worms.

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:57.529
Hinamizawa was just a chunk
of the game board to control.

00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:59.156
Not anymore.

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:00.657
You burned everything of value,

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.577
and now this place is as
worthless as that old scrapbook.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.288
I'm telling you, the scrapbook
isn't worthless, dammit!

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.706
Every word is true!

00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:09.166
My grandfather was right,

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:12.335
and I picked up his research
from where he left off!

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:14.588
After all these years,
I understand the‐‐

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.176
[OKONOGI] Fortunately,
our clients in Tokyo were able

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:22.345
to find one final opportunity
for you to make yourself useful

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.681
before we all part ways.

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:26.141
Now.

00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:35.233
Huh?

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.568
What are you saying?

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.320
I'm asking you to
blow your brains out

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:41.907
and give us a clean
ending to this story.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.785
A good captain should always
go down with the ship.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:47.329
The person responsible
for this travesty will be dead,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.707
and the Mountain Dogs and our
clients will be off the hook.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.083
You must be crazy if you think

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.377
I'll kill myself for
the sake of your clients!

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.757
In the end, it doesn't
matter who kills you.

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:00.759
Maybe I tried to talk you
into surrendering,

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:01.927
and you refused.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.638
Maybe you decided you
could still put up a fight.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.557
Of course I'd have to
defend myself, wouldn't I?

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.185
Honestly, after all the
years we've worked together,

00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:13.563
I wanted to offer you the
dignity of ending it yourself.

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.440
No. I refuse to accept this!

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:18.109
I demand you tell me
who's responsible!

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.611
Let's just say
that if we got you

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:21.238
that line to Nomura in Tokyo,

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:24.783
the conversation wouldn't
go the way you'd like.

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:27.410
You might remember
her codename is "Cuckoo."

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:28.578
And if I recall correctly,

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.623
your codename is "Baby Bird."

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:32.833
[TAKANO]
No.

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:33.959
She couldn't.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.836
Cuckoos invade
the nests of other birds

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:37.379
when they lay their eggs,

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.464
and once the
baby cuckoo hatches,

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.424
it immediately muscles
all the other eggs

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:45.387
and hatchlings out and
takes over the nest for itself.

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:47.556
The babies on the
ground are helpless.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:48.557
There's nothing to save them

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.767
if they encounter
a wild mountain dog,

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.644
or a hunter's bloodhound.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:59.442
[OKONOGI] Nobody's ever had
your back in this, Major.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:02.571
[OKONOGI]
Here.

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:04.239
It means something to you.

00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:05.740
Hold onto it.

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.830
[OKONOGI] Try and do it
with just your left hand.

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:14.499
You'll need your
right hand to use the gun.

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:24.801
There's one in the chamber.

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:26.303
In the mouth, not the temple,

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:28.805
and remember
to point back, not up.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:32.350
[OKONOGI]
It's simple.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:35.604
Just hold it steady
and squeeze the trigger.

Been a while, hasn't it?

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.048
It's Nomura.

Ms. Nomura.

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:06.301
I'm always happy
to hear from you.

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:08.470
How can I be of assistance?

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:11.222
[NOMURA] I was hoping for
an update on your progress.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.016
The date of the final operation

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:16.061
is rapidly approaching,
after all.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:19.689
Yes, but I don't see
a reason to rush.

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:20.815
One might take that to mean

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:23.318
you have misgivings
about the plan.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.445
[TAKANO]
No, not in the least.

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:28.114
Everything has gone
according to expectations.

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:29.616
[NOMURA]
I'm glad to hear that.

00:07:29.658 --> 00:07:30.659
I wanted to remind you

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.370
that our groundwork
is fully in place.

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:35.372
You do understand
exactly what I mean

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.749
when I say that, do you not?

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:40.210
Yes. We can't turn back.

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.127
The plan is in motion,

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.630
and we won't stop
until we see it through.

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:45.090
That's incorrect.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.592
It's true that the plan
is now very much in motion

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:50.053
and turning back
is no longer an option.

00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:52.097
More importantly,
if that plan so much as hints

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.807
at veering from its course.

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:55.183
It will become necessary for us

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.602
to purge all
physical evidence of it.

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:59.521
That's what I mean.

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:01.314
This would also
involve us publicly

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:03.858
denigrating your
grandfather's research.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.361
His work would be
dismissed as pseudoscience,

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:09.739
cementing his legacy as a
charlatan and a laughingstock.

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:15.495
[GRANDFATHER] These parasites
are unique to Hinamizawa, and‐‐

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:18.665
I was promised research,
and you hand me pulp fiction?

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:20.542
Please, I have more. Sir‐‐

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:23.962
We agreed to hear you out
as a favor to Professor Koizumi,

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:24.963
and now that that's done,

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.089
I think we can safely say

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:29.426
that what you're showing us
is unmitigated nonsense.

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:31.177
[RESEARCHER A] As a student
of the natural sciences,

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:32.345
I have no interest

00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:34.806
in workshopping
your creative writing.

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:37.767
I share his disappointment,
sad to say.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.978
But there're plenty of
other ways to occupy yourself

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.688
in your twilight years.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.565
Perhaps you've
considered bonsai?

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:44.774
Just as productive.

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:45.859
And calming!

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.776
Dear, me.

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:49.904
I find our colleagues'
words a bit uncharitable.

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:52.866
I know some publishers
who might be interested in you.

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:56.453
This kind of piece does well
with less discerning audiences.

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:58.663
[laughter]

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:01.416
[RESEARCHER B] You could
get a screenplay worked up!

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:03.752
If you'd kindly take back
your work product.

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:06.713
I can't, in good conscience,
refer to it as "research,"

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:07.589
but whatever it is,

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.009
I believe I've seen
quite enough of it.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.098
[TAKANO]
No! Quit it!

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.683
Quit stepping on it!

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:19.934
Stop it. Please.

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.269
It's important.

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:23.730
Grandpa worked hard on this!

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:26.691
[cries]
Please. Don't step on it!

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.651
It means so much to him!

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:31.154
[GRANDFATHER] Do excuse
my granddaughter's behavior.

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:34.282
Thank you all
very much for your time.

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:47.962
[GRANDFATHER]
I'm sorry.

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.506
It wasn't me alone.

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:52.342
You put your heart
into this work too, Miyo,

00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:54.677
and in the end,
it all went to waste.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.306
Forgive me, please.

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.602
Grandpa.

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:03.645
[NOMURA]
Needless to say,

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:06.689
you would never allow
that to happen, would you?

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:08.900
[TAKANO]
No. Of course not.

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:11.402
[NOMURA] Good. I'm glad
to hear that all is well.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.446
[chuckles]

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:14.614
Moving on.

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:17.534
Our friend Lieutenant Tomitake's
set to arrive soon.

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:20.328
He will play a vital role
in the opening phase.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.913
Proceed as planned.

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:23.748
Those are your orders.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.750
All preparations are in place,

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.252
and next, we're to dose him

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:30.880
with H173 in the guise
of a prophylactic.

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.549
[NOMURA]
To the letter.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.968
This operation hinges
on Tomitake dying

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:37.053
under shady circumstances.

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:40.056
I expect we'll be
speaking again soon.

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:13.923
Pardon me!

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:16.926
I promise it wasn't my
intention to sneak up on you!

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:20.805
I had no intention of
being snuck up on, either.

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:22.891
Is there something
I can help you with?

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:23.850
Actually.

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:24.726
Satoko is coming in

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:26.728
for a checkup
later this afternoon.

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:29.772
I'd been planning
to get ready for that.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.691
What's this?

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:33.234
A photo album?

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:34.152
[TAKANO]
Yes.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:35.361
My grandfather's.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:36.571
Your grandfather's.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:37.780
Is that right?

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:40.992
I believe I recall you
mentioning your parents before.

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:42.827
I haven't looked at it in years.

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.454
I put it away back when he died,

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:46.539
and I've never
gotten it out since.

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.791
And then, today,
for some reason,

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:51.211
I felt compelled
to reach for it.

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:54.672
In hindsight, I might have
been acting childish, but...

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:55.590
You see,

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:58.343
I promised that until the day
I made our dream come true,

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:00.887
I'd never open this album again.

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.723
[IRIE] A dream you shared
with your grandfather, then?

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.475
[exhales]

00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:07.393
I'm not sure what came over me.

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:10.521
Somehow, I couldn't help
breaking that promise.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:13.399
I needed to see
his smile so badly.

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:18.196
You can take your time.

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:20.240
I'll take care of the prep work.

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:23.493
If anything comes up,
I'll be in the exam room.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:05.868
[SATOKO]
I know it's a weekly event.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.036
But having to get a checkup

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:09.539
on my day off
doesn't seem fair to me.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.999
[RIKA]
It's important!

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.126
Irie needs to
track your progress.

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:16.087
That way, we can make sure
the medicine is still working.

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:18.006
Considering how long
I've been taking it,

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:19.132
I should hope it is.

00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:20.008
And to this day,

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:22.552
I have no idea what they've
been injecting me with.

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:24.262
Me neither.

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:26.931
I hadn't even
thought about asking.

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:29.559
But maybe Irie would
be able to tell you!

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.185
Ni‐paa!

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.985
You're truly
the best liar I know.

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:41.821
[TAKANO]
Okay, last one.

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:43.072
Ready, Satoko?

00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:45.158
What do you see?

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:46.826
[SATOKO]
A pair of butterflies.

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:49.162
They've been separated
for far too long,

00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:52.832
and now they're terribly happy
they've finally been reunited.

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.625
My, what a lovely thought.

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.461
These results are splendid.

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:57.920
How wonderful to hear that.

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.213
I suppose we can say

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.299
that the coach's medicine
has been effective.

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.343
As effective as
we could have hoped for.

00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:06.346
Your last injection
may not be far off now.

00:14:06.387 --> 00:14:09.057
If that's true, then the last
of these insufferable checkups

00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:10.475
will be close behind.

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:12.268
[chuckles]

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.146
I understand our visits
aren't much fun for you.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:19.192
Or perhaps, your objection
is to me, personally?

00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:20.026
Oh no.

00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:22.362
My objection's purely
to the checkups.

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:25.656
Heh. Well, that's a relief.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:26.699
Anyway,

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:29.160
I've been considering
giving up my job here.

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.578
What?

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.664
[GRANDFATHER]
"For the time being.

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.666
I still have the
wherewithal to stand

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:38.086
against the progression
of this disease.

00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:40.588
Before long,
as it ravages my brain,

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.091
it will take everything
from me that I hold dear.

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:45.468
But for now, I am of sound mind,

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.388
and I still know you are
my precious granddaughter.

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:51.516
So I must gather my thoughts,
while I still have them.

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:54.060
You've grown into a brilliant,
capable young woman.

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:56.229
I can't overstate
the joy I feel for knowing

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.147
you mean to continue my work

00:14:58.189 --> 00:15:00.483
and accomplish what I could not.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:02.985
But within that joy
is a tinge of worry,

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:06.322
that in becoming so enveloped
in my life and research,

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:08.157
you may inadvertently
pass by those things

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:11.119
which might make
you truly happy.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.455
To see that would turn
my joy to unbearable sorrow.

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:16.416
I want you to do
what brings you joy,

00:15:16.457 --> 00:15:18.543
and I would sooner see
my research abandoned

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:20.378
than have you suffer for it.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.131
Yet you've been eagerly
pursuing medicine

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:24.674
in hopes of continuing it.

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:27.093
I feared that by
voicing my concerns.

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:29.262
I would be saddling you
with my doubt,

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:31.514
and for that,
you would only suffer more.

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.099
Ultimately, only fate knows

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:35.435
which burden will weigh heavier.

00:15:35.476 --> 00:15:36.394
Should you read this letter.

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:38.479
I hope you will
take it to heart.

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:41.607
My dearest wish is that
you one day find happiness.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:43.484
But in my weakness,
I must leave it to the whims

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.153
of fate to make it so.

00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:48.406
For this,
I beg your forgiveness.

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:49.824
To my beloved Miyo.

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:53.077
Your grandpa, Hifumi Takano."

00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:00.376
I can't guess at
your circumstances.

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:02.920
But do you really plan
on quitting this job?

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:05.006
I'm still just considering.

00:16:05.047 --> 00:16:07.842
I'm nowhere near a decision yet.

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.844
The thing is,
my employers' goals

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:11.596
and my own may be at odds,

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.264
and I think they've been
twisting my passion

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:15.600
for my work toward
their own ends.

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:17.935
After that, they'll dispose
of you like the trimmings

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.688
and bones after the stock
is done simmering, right?

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.232
I suspect they plan
to do just that.

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:24.317
Once the stock is made,

00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:26.444
of course you would
throw those things away.

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:29.489
Come now. Those ingredients
may still have a use.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.991
Perhaps it's simply
a matter of finding one!

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:33.534
[laughs]

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:34.911
You have a fair point there,

00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:36.287
but if you're trying
to make more stock,

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:37.580
you're not likely to get it done

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:40.249
with a used‐up
batch of ingredients.

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.168
[SATOKO]
I suppose that's true.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:45.713
The question is, what are
my options after all this?

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:46.881
Look at me.

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:48.966
I'm way out of my depth, here.

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:00.186
[MION]
Kei!

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:01.771
‐‐Get a move on already!
‐‐Yeah!

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:04.815
Hurry, or Rika's dance is gonna
start before we get there!

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.442
Yeah, I'm trying to hurry.

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:07.944
It's just,
a million people decided

00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:09.779
to show up all of a sudden!

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.531
[chortles]

00:17:11.572 --> 00:17:14.033
Your excuses are weaker
than your skills, Keiichi!

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:16.953
I can hardly imagine you
becoming president of our club!

00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:19.580
Wait. Me, becoming
president of our club?

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:21.666
Who said anything about that?

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:23.376
Anyway, if you'll pardon me.

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:29.549
[MION] Hurry up or
we're gonna ditch you, Kei!

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.593
[RENA] Awoo!
I believe in you, Keiichi!

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:33.970
What the hell, guys!

00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:36.055
You know getting mad's
not gonna help, Keiichi,

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:38.015
you just gotta get moving!

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:42.311
[yells]

00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:44.397
[pants]

00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:45.940
I made it through somehow.

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:47.191
Good job, buddy.

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:49.610
Where did Satoko run off to?

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:50.820
So she left me in the crowd,

00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:52.446
and now she's not even here?

00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:54.699
I do not understand that kid.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.118
She'll be watching it
from somewhere.

00:17:57.159 --> 00:18:00.788
Yeah! There's no way Satoko's
gonna miss Rika's dance.

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:11.507
[TAKANO]
Thanks for waiting.

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:12.717
[TOMITAKE]
Are you satisfied?

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:16.304
I am, and I think I can move
forward now with no regrets.

00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:18.806
Though you really should
have taken a peek too.

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:21.058
[TOMITAKE chuckles]
Everything in me was saying,

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.812
"Don't do it." Anyway,
I was about to head down

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:27.231
and get some pictures
of the cotton drifting.

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.983
Would you like to come with me?

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:29.984
[TAKANO]
Hey, Jiro?

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:31.193
[TOMITAKE]
Hmm?

00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:34.030
[TAKANO] There's something very
important I need to tell you.

00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:36.866
Wha...? Okay. [laughs]

00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:38.159
What is it?

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.036
[TAKANO] I seem to have
gotten myself wrapped up

00:18:40.077 --> 00:18:42.413
in a bit of a conspiracy.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.957
"The final operation."

00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:46.959
That's what they're calling it.

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:55.134
[SOLDIER D]
Retriever Leader to all units.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:57.762
Report in when target
sites are occupied.

00:18:57.803 --> 00:19:00.431
I repeat,
Retriever Leader to all units.

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:02.266
Report in when
target sites are occupied.

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:04.018
[EUA] You've created
a world where the rules,

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.770
which had given rise
to the cat's tragedy

00:19:05.853 --> 00:19:08.105
are no longer in effect.

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:10.816
[laughs]
Fascinating!

00:19:10.858 --> 00:19:12.443
In granting you
the use of my power,

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:15.529
I never expected you
to employ it so creatively.

00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:17.239
[SATOKO] This isn't
something to laugh about.

00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:18.157
[EUA]
Hmm?

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:20.117
Rika's longing to
escape made her world

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:22.953
a birdcage that
held her for a century.

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:25.790
But my longing for her
to stay opens the birdcage,

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:28.292
and she inevitably flies away.

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:30.711
Wishes don't easily come true

00:19:30.753 --> 00:19:33.005
for any of us in Hinamizawa.

00:19:33.047 --> 00:19:34.757
And as I've told you before,

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:37.385
changes such as
these are irreversible.

00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:38.719
The accumulation of memories

00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:40.680
caused the birdcage to weaken.

00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:41.764
In no world is it certain

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:44.392
to withstand the
cat's efforts to flee.

00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:46.477
[SATOKO]
It's unforgivable.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:50.356
Rika was anointed to serve as
a priestess to the god Oyashiro.

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:52.775
Abandoning the village
is a grievous sin.

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:56.612
Yes, and punishing
her is my duty.

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.531
Oh! I see.

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:00.366
Then you'll take on
the name of Oyashiro

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:03.244
and unleash your
curse upon the cat.

00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:04.203
Indeed.

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.372
I'll be the one to
ensnare Rika once again

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:08.666
in an endless cycle of tragedy.

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:12.294
Through that tragedy,
she'll come to understand.

00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:15.631
That with the sin of abandoning
Hinamizawa in her heart,

00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:19.969
she binds herself to an
eternity of misery and loss.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.595
[EUA chuckles]

00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:22.596
Then you've come to understand

00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:25.266
that Takano has given up
on her pursuit of godhood,

00:20:25.307 --> 00:20:28.686
and in response, you've
begun pursuing it for yourself!

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:31.897
May your amusements never cease.

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:34.400
Now then.

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:37.278
You, who have taken
the name, "Oyashiro."

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:40.322
By what means shall you
put your curse into effect?

00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:46.078
I've calculated it
down to the last detail.

00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:50.583
[TOMITAKE laughs]
I'd honestly planned to do that

00:20:50.624 --> 00:20:52.209
the second I walked out of here.

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:55.087
I didn't figure you'd come
this far just for an injection.

00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:57.715
The only shots you really care
about are your bird photos.

00:20:57.757 --> 00:20:59.550
[laughs]

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:00.718
Wait for me here.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.261
I need to get ready.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.803
[TAKANO]
I'm so sorry.

00:21:43.844 --> 00:21:46.430
I forgot the prophylactic
in my room.

00:21:46.472 --> 00:21:48.182
I promise I'll be quick.

00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:49.433
Sure.

00:22:24.802 --> 00:22:27.763
[EUA] Now the tragedy shall
strike only at your whim.

00:22:27.805 --> 00:22:28.889
And, it shall be you

00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:32.268
who decides through
whom your wrath manifests.

00:22:32.309 --> 00:22:33.602
Does the weight of your actions

00:22:33.644 --> 00:22:36.605
truly bear not at all
upon your conscience?

00:22:36.647 --> 00:22:37.982
[SATOKO]
They weigh nothing.

00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:39.441
Once I've brought
about the world

00:22:39.483 --> 00:22:41.735
where Rika and
I can remain together,

00:22:41.777 --> 00:22:44.405
there will be no
more tragedy to suffer.

00:22:45.823 --> 00:22:47.575
[SATOKO]
And once I reach that world,

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:50.369
my deeds in the worlds before
it ceases to mean anything.

00:22:50.411 --> 00:22:52.830
The real world is that
which satisfies me.

00:22:52.872 --> 00:22:54.999
The others are
dreams and illusions.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.251
Why would I feel any
remorse over some actions

00:22:57.293 --> 00:22:59.253
I only took in a dream?

00:23:00.546 --> 00:23:01.589
[EUA] In your journey
through the loops,

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:02.965
your disposition and talents

00:23:03.007 --> 00:23:05.301
will undoubtedly serve
you quite well.

00:23:05.342 --> 00:23:08.012
You can't still be surprised,
can you, Eua?

00:23:10.598 --> 00:23:12.016
[SATOKO]
I choose to win,

00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:14.935
and at that moment,
my victory is sealed.

00:23:14.977 --> 00:23:18.105
I'm choosing a future in
Hinamizawa with Rika at my side,

00:23:18.147 --> 00:23:20.774
and I will not
give up on that future.

00:23:20.816 --> 00:23:21.984
Indeed.

00:23:22.026 --> 00:23:25.279
I will bring it about,
with utmost certainty.

00:23:26.822 --> 00:23:29.325
We will be together
again soon, Rika.

00:23:29.366 --> 00:23:31.493
My sweet, beloved Rika!

00:23:32.453 --> 00:23:34.622
The world we want
is almost in reach.

00:23:34.663 --> 00:23:36.665
Our happiness is coming!

00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:53.474
[RIKA] Next time:
