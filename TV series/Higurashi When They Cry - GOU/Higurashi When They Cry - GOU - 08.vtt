WEBVTT

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.354
[KEIICHI]
Hmm? Ms. Chie.

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:21.438
Huh?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.941
Did anybody find the mayor?

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:25.359
[CHIE]
No.

00:00:26.652 --> 00:00:29.821
No updates since we
found out he was missing.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.241
I'm sure he's going to be fine.

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.201
Now, let's hurry back to class.

00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:37.746
Okay.

00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:40.415
[CHIE] All right everybody,
time for class!

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:45.754
That's odd. Where's Ms. Furude?

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:49.841
She would never be this tardy.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.844
Has anybody seen
her since lunch, kids?

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:55.556
[SATOKO]
Keiichi.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:58.809
I believe that you and Rika were
talking at lunch, weren't you?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.935
[KEIICHI]
Uh.

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.147
[KEIICHI]
Uh, yeah.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.900
We talked a little before
you showed up, but then,

00:01:06.942 --> 00:01:08.902
she was gone.

00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:14.449
Actually, I think I saw her
behind the school with someone.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.411
And this was somebody
other than Keiichi?

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.747
I couldn't see the guy
she was talking to.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:21.665
[KEIICHI]
Who was it?

00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:25.502
Uh! It was a man dressed
like a construction worker.

00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:27.045
[SATOKO]
That seems strange.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:29.965
Why would a construction
worker be here?

00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:31.091
This is bad.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.468
[GIRL B]
Now Rika's missing, too?

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:45.647
[SATOKO]
Rika!

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.817
Rika! Where are you?

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:52.988
Can you hear me?
Hey, come out, Ms. Furude!

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.115
Where are you?

00:01:55.157 --> 00:01:56.283
[MION]
Rika!

00:01:56.325 --> 00:01:59.953
Rika! Shout if you can hear us!

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:15.552
‐‐The heck?
‐‐[MION] Over here, Kei!

00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:16.678
What'd you find?

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.889
[MION] I think there's
something on the roof!

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:25.771
Rika?

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:31.485
She's not up here. No luck.

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:33.153
I don't see anything.

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:36.323
[MION] Sorry, my eyes
are playing tricks on me.

00:02:40.077 --> 00:02:40.869
It's weird.

00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:43.372
She was acting really
strange during lunch too.

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.666
What could've happened to her?

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:47.250
[MION]
I have to put an end to this.

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.460
[KEIICHI]
Hm?

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:51.338
What's that?

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.799
Whatever you said just now,
I missed it, Mion.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.135
[MION] I said,
I have to put an end to this.

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:02.849
Whoa, Mion.

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.351
Are you okay?

00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:05.811
You look really mad.

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.187
Rika Furude.

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:11.149
She's head of one of the
village's Three Great Families.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.151
She's carrying out the curse.

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:17.614
[MION] It's her.
She's behind all of it!

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.827
[MION]
That's right. It must be.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.746
She did it. Everything!

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:26.498
She's trying to kill people!

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.375
Covering it up
with family histories

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:30.168
and Lord Oyashiro's legend.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.712
I won't let her!

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:32.963
I can stop her.

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.631
I can put an end to this curse.

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.217
I know that girl is
trying to kill people!

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.136
I know it was her!

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:40.345
I know it!

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.389
I know it, I know it!

00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:45.016
I know it, I know it, I know it!

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.852
I know it, I know it.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.395
C‐Calm down, Mion!

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:49.730
What are you talking about?

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:50.564
[MION]
I know it!

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:52.691
I know it, I know it, I know it!

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:54.234
I know it, I know it!

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:56.820
I know it, I know,
I know, I know...

00:03:56.862 --> 00:03:57.362
Please Mion!

00:03:57.404 --> 00:04:00.157
I know it, I know it, I know it,
I know it, I know it, I know it,

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:01.616
I know it, I know it, I know it,

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:02.909
I know it, I know it,
I know it, I know it...

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:04.828
[CHIE]
Hey, you two!

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:11.209
Is there something wrong?

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:15.422
Nothing, ma'am, but Rika
doesn't seem to be here.

00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:17.340
[CHIE] We're cancelling class
for the day.

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:20.552
Let the staff worry about
finding Ms. Furude, all right?

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:22.053
You two should head home.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.889
Okay, we will.

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:34.357
[RENA]
Hmm?

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.692
What's up, Keiichi?

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:36.943
What's wrong?

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.279
It's my fault.

00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:41.031
All of it.

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:43.408
[RENA]
Why would you say that?

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.660
What makes you
think it's your fault?

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:46.995
Can you talk about it?

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:50.999
Well...

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.337
Sorry. Not right now.

00:05:03.512 --> 00:05:04.888
Dammit all.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.848
If I'd known things were
gonna get this serious,

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.016
I would never have gone into

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:11.645
that stupid storehouse
at the festival!

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:14.940
We've insulted Oyashiro.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.526
But that was all Shion's idea!

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.695
It's her fault, so why
should I be punished for it?

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:24.241
No. That's wrong.

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:26.076
We both did what we did.

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:28.620
It doesn't matter
whose fault it was now.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:46.847
[phone rings]

00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:53.812
Who is it?

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:54.896
[MION]
Hi, Kei.

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:57.315
Uh. Shion, I‐‐

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.528
Uh. No. Wait.

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:06.408
Is this Mion?

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.702
[MION] I want you
to come over here right now.

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:10.203
Uh. Over where?

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:12.497
To the Sonozaki estate?

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.999
[MION]
In front of the waterwheel.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.542
[phone clicks]

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:20.213
[KEIICHI]
What's going on?

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:23.758
I'd been thinking there
might be something

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.552
you wanted to tell me.

00:06:25.594 --> 00:06:26.261
Huh?

00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:28.471
I know you're nervous right now.

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:30.807
Trust me, I get it.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.267
Don't worry.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.146
Huh?

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:39.774
Come on. We'll talk at my place.

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.069
Okay then.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:59.794
The whole forest, or really,
the whole mountain.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.421
It's like your backyard, right?

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:04.299
[MION] Well,
it's all our family's land.

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.009
"Backyard" is a stretch.

00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:09.095
It's not like we have
gardeners taking care of it.

00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:23.109
It must be cool living in an
old‐fashioned house like this.

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.694
What, are you serious?

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:26.947
The wind blows straight
through the place.

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:27.530
Oh.

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:30.158
And it doesn't do a
damn thing against the cold.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.495
Although, getting snow off
your roof's gonna suck.

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.747
Uh. Does it snow
a lot around here?

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:36.790
[MION]
You didn't know?

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:39.084
Hinamizawa's in the
middle of snow country!

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.503
Oh... Are you serious?

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.713
Aw, crap, I hate cold weather!

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:45.423
Well, we'd best get
to work on toughening up

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.342
that city‐slicker hide
if you're gonna make it

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:50.345
through your first
Hinamizawa winter!

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:53.056
Screw that!
I'll just sit by the stove!

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:54.766
This'll be a fun winter!

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:56.226
[laughs]

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.144
You are such an ass.

00:07:58.186 --> 00:07:59.229
[MION]
Yeah, well.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.731
I'll go put on
some tea for us, okay?

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:10.699
[cicada cries]

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:19.124
You feel it, right?

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:19.874
Huh?

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:23.920
[MION] That creeping sense
there's somebody out to get you.

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:26.256
If I did, what would it mean?

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:30.510
Sorry, I promise I wasn't trying
to scare you with that question.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.057
Mion. Listen.

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:39.019
I need to apologize
to you for something.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.271
To me? For what?

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:42.355
[exhales]

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:46.192
Last night, at the shrine,
during the festival.

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:48.778
I snuck into the old storehouse.

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:52.991
I knew it was
the wrong thing to do.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:57.120
I was just too curious!

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:58.204
I'm sorry!

00:08:58.246 --> 00:08:59.622
I already knew that.

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:00.790
You and Shion broke into

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:03.501
the Furude Shrine tool
storehouse last night.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:06.963
And I knew that Tomitake and
Takano were there with you too.

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:09.883
Honestly, people
found out pretty quick.

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:11.217
And even if you're the new kid,

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:14.220
and you were tagging
along out of simple curiosity.

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.306
You should realize that
a lot of folks in the village

00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:19.225
aren't gonna be willing to let
you off the hook for this.

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:20.852
It's a serious thing.

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:25.440
I know it might be too late to
ask this, but please forgive me!

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:39.496
[MION]
Look at me.

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:43.792
I'm with you.

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.752
I wanna help you
get through all this,

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:48.421
so I need you to trust me.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:52.383
You don't realize
how badly I want to.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:53.635
I just...

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.845
After what Rika said.

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:57.931
After everything
that's happened.

00:09:57.972 --> 00:10:01.518
I feel like I never really knew
anything about any of you!

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:02.852
It's okay.

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:05.313
You already confessed
to what you did.

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:08.358
You knew it was wrong,
and you apologized.

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:11.111
I'm sure I can trust you, Kei.

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:12.278
Mion.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.238
[MION]
So now,

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:16.241
I need you to trust
me too, all right?

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.576
I'm on your side
even if no one else is!

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.036
Okay?

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:21.246
[gasps]

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:27.710
[KEIICHI]
Okay. I trust you.

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.254
Thanks, Mion.

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.717
[KEIICHI]
Please. Tell me.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:37.095
The deaths during Watanagashi.

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.930
Why do they keep happening?

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:41.057
Why did all those
people have to die?

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:43.393
Of course you would
want to know that.

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:48.356
At first, it was just a
few coincidental deaths.

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:51.192
But after that,
it became something else.

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:53.027
Some villagers started
using the curse

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.405
of Lord Oyashiro as an excuse.

00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:58.533
A way to avoid having
to call it what it is.

00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:00.118
[KEIICHI]
What do you mean?

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.244
An excuse?

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:03.830
[MION] They claim they're
doing Lord Oyashiro's will

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:07.000
by killing the village's enemies
on the night of Watanagashi.

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:08.293
[gasps]

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:09.878
No. No way.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:13.464
We're in the boonies,
not the feudal era!

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.049
[MION]
Follow me.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.896
[MION]
You saw them yourself.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:30.190
All those torture devices
in the storehouse.

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:33.610
[KEIICHI] Yeah, but hadn't they
been locked up in there forever?

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:37.113
Takano was really excited,
but it wasn't my thing.

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.076
[KEIICHI]
Damn, that reeks!

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:43.411
[MION] The tools they
keep in there were used

00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:45.580
by the people of
Onigafuchi Village

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:48.416
to enforce the strict laws
of their religion.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.379
[MION] Anybody who violated
those laws would be tortured

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:56.007
and executed to set an example.

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.258
That was the past!

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.802
We're not living in some
medieval murder village!

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:02.639
[MION] Right. In those times,
the Watanagashi ritual

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.310
was overseen by the Three
Great Families of the village.

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:10.980
But then, things in this
country started changing fast,

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:13.775
and soon the influence of the
Kimiyoshi and Furude families

00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:15.401
began to fade.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:19.197
The ritual was abandoned,
and the tools were stowed away.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.957
So my family built this place.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.291
Does that mean that...?

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:31.668
Could this be...?

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:33.211
[MION]
A secret chamber for performing

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:36.297
the original Watanagashi ritual.

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:41.719
[MION]
See for yourself.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.012
[gasps]

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:48.977
Get it?

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:53.940
We're living in the year 1983,
but some things don't change.

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:55.817
Even if we call it Hinamizawa,

00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:59.362
it's still the village where
the demons once lived.

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:00.488
There's no way.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.490
The Sonozaki family
only built this place

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:05.910
after the old Watanagashi
ritual fell out of practice,

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:10.206
and nothing in this room has
ever been used as far as I know.

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:13.126
But still,
there are rumors around town

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:16.296
that we have a place
to keep up the old ways.

00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:18.131
And they're all true.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.136
There's more here?

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:24.470
What is this?

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.187
[MION]
We're near the end.

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:34.814
My uncle's safe room.

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:37.608
It's the most secure place
on our property.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.319
And this door...

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.071
You could shoot it all day
and not leave a dent.

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:42.822
This place.

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:45.283
How deep does all this go?

00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:53.916
Somebody could
practically live down here.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.544
Which is exactly why
we keep it stocked with food.

00:13:56.586 --> 00:14:00.173
Electrical, phone,
and plumbing, obviously.

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:03.551
If they have to,
someone can survive

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:06.804
on what we've got down here
for at least a month, easy.

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.140
So I'm sure you're
gonna be fine, Kei.

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:13.978
What does that mean?

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.439
What does all this
have to do with me?

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:17.523
[MION]
Listen,

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:20.610
I want you to lie low down here.

00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:22.278
Starting right now.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.154
Hold on.

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:25.823
Slow down, Mion!

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.241
What about my parents?

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:28.785
They're gonna wonder where I'm‐‐

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.708
What're you doing? Mion!

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.668
Let me out!

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.921
[MION]
There's no other way.

00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:43.716
There are still people trying to
carry out Lord Oyashiro's curse.

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:45.802
The truth is,
the village is the soil

00:14:45.843 --> 00:14:50.348
those poison fruits
need to keep growing.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.476
But even if that's true, why
would you lock me in here?

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:54.560
[MION]
Because!

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:56.854
Until I've finished doing
what I need to do,

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.940
you'll be safe here!

00:14:58.981 --> 00:14:59.816
You can't.

00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:00.900
[MION]
It's okay.

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:02.318
I promise I'll
let you out of here

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.613
once I know nobody's trying
to hurt you anymore!

00:15:06.697 --> 00:15:08.032
[KEIICHI]
Please unlock this.

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:10.201
I swear I won't leave.

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:11.619
[MION]
I'm sorry, Kei,

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:15.081
but that cell is the only
safe place for you to be.

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:17.417
If I don't manage to win this,

00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:18.709
when they find you in there,

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:21.295
tell them I kidnapped you
and threw you in that cage,

00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:24.132
and you didn't know
anything about my plans!

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.763
Mion, will you at least tell me

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:33.349
what you're trying
to do out there?

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:37.728
In Hinamizawa,
if a member of the community

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.523
is suffering and somebody
has the means to make it better,

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:44.026
they're always expected to
offer whatever they can to help.

00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:46.404
The reason this village
has survived as long as it has

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:49.782
is that the people here
look out for each other.

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:51.367
[KEIICHI]
You mean like when those punks

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:53.411
were threatening me before.

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:55.163
Exactly. But something happened

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:59.375
that warped that spirit of
solidarity into something ugly.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:00.585
Right, the dam.

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:03.671
Soon it stopped being about
protecting our way of life.

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:07.550
There were some villagers
who were just after revenge.

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:08.968
And their hatred.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:13.431
It took Satoko's family away.

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:17.643
Our old customs. Our sense
of kindness and togetherness.

00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:20.480
They've been twisted into
vengeance and cruelty.

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:24.150
And all of us are
to blame for it.

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:27.361
But all of that happened
so long ago now!

00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:28.821
[MION]
You're exactly right.

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:31.532
We're not in the time
of men and demons.

00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:34.952
It's 1983, the modern age.

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:40.208
And I, de facto head
of the Three Families,

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:42.793
heiress to the Sonozaki name,

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:46.380
will abolish the
custom once and for all!

00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:49.050
It was our failings that created
the curse that's been taking

00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:52.428
our neighbors' lives
for five straight years.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.971
We gave birth to a monster

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:56.599
we didn't have the
strength to control.

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:58.267
It's my duty.

00:16:58.309 --> 00:16:59.435
Do you understand?

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.437
It has to be me!

00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:03.648
I still don't know what
you're planning to do out there,

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:05.066
but whatever it is.

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:06.400
I wanna help you, Mion!

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:08.277
Just tell me what I can do!

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.489
We're on the same
side here, remember?

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:14.283
Y'know, that one time.

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:17.703
At the game tournament,
when you gave me that doll.

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:24.126
You looked at me like
I was just a normal girl.

00:17:24.168 --> 00:17:27.255
I was happy.

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:29.507
I'm doing this
'cause I love you.

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.509
Understand?

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.636
I promise to protect you!

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:34.512
But you won't be safe

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:38.766
until I've put an end to
this sick ritual permanently!

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:41.394
Mion.

00:17:41.435 --> 00:17:47.525
[alarm sounds]

00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:51.904
Is there somebody here?

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:55.950
[MION] Heh!
They've sent someone after me.

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:59.245
It's possible they've caught on.

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.038
Well, that's fun.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.665
I should greet them.

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:04.917
No, wait. Please don't go.

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:06.168
[MION]
Excuse me, Kei.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.921
Looks like I have
a guest to entertain.

00:18:13.467 --> 00:18:14.343
A gun?

00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:15.219
Mion!

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:17.138
What are you
planning to do with that?

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:19.640
That isn't a real pistol, is it?

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:24.770
[MION]
I might not be back for a while.

00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:27.148
There's gonna be a lot
of work to do out there.

00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:28.190
[KEIICHI]
Please don't go!

00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:29.942
What about the cops?

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:32.361
If we're in danger,
then call them!

00:18:32.403 --> 00:18:35.406
The cops aren't gonna
have our backs on this, Kei.

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:37.658
Not here in Hinamizawa.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.244
And remember,
if something goes wrong.

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:44.373
If the person who finds
you down here isn't me,

00:18:44.415 --> 00:18:46.417
you tell them I kidnapped you.

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.878
That I threw you in that cell
and walked out the door.

00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:50.671
They should let you
off the hook then.

00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:51.464
Mion!

00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:53.883
Please, you don't have
to go out there!

00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:55.384
Come back!

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.347
You can't.

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:05.353
[yells]

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:24.038
Dammit!

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:55.111
Mion!

00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:08.207
[OOISHI]
Maebara! Can you hear me?

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:14.213
Hang on!

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:37.236
Mion.

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:39.238
[OOISHI]
Mister Maebara!

00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:43.284
I stopped by to look
for you at the hospital,

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:46.495
but they said you'd
already been discharged.

00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:49.206
Has the head wound
been healing up okay?

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:50.416
[KEIICHI]
All thanks to you.

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:52.334
You should really thank
the detective in the area

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:53.878
who happened
to hear that gunshot,

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:56.797
'cause he's the only
reason we found you.

00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:59.633
The truth is that damn near
everything went wrong that day,

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:02.845
but at least we pulled one
person outta that bunker alive!

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:04.555
[laughs]

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:05.806
Just one?

00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:06.849
Did Mion‐‐

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:08.476
[OOISHI]
Okay, stay calm, now.

00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:10.686
How am I supposed to stay calm?

00:21:10.728 --> 00:21:12.313
[OOISHI]
Mister Maebara.

00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:14.982
That underground prison
where you'd been locked up.

00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:19.278
Were you aware of the fact that
there was also a well in there?

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.446
A well?

00:21:20.488 --> 00:21:23.783
I'd never been there before,
so no, I had no idea.

00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:25.201
I hadn't seen it.

00:21:25.242 --> 00:21:28.037
[OOISHI] The police searched it
all the way to the bottom.

00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:30.289
And we found multiple bodies.

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:34.251
[OOISHI] We were
able to positively identify

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:37.922
Oryo Sonozaki,
Kiichiro Kimiyoshi,

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:40.966
and one Shion Sonozaki.

00:21:41.008 --> 00:21:42.051
Shion?

00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:42.593
But‐‐

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.011
[OOISHI] That's not to
mention the multiple sets

00:21:44.053 --> 00:21:46.096
of skeletal remains
that had been decaying

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:47.807
for ten years or more.

00:21:47.848 --> 00:21:49.600
At least three
different victims.

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:51.685
Seems that was
somewhere Hinamizawa

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:54.021
buries its dark secrets.

00:21:54.063 --> 00:21:57.066
Then after that, we found Rika.

00:21:57.107 --> 00:21:58.442
Was she okay?

00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:00.027
I'm sorry to tell you.

00:22:00.069 --> 00:22:03.906
By the time we got to her,
she was long dead already.

00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:05.115
Her body was discovered

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:08.118
floating in the septic tank
at your school.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.247
And based on her condition,
it wasn't an easy death.

00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:12.873
Then was that...

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.961
‐‐The heck?
‐‐[MION] Over here, Kei!

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:18.671
And then she...

00:22:20.548 --> 00:22:22.550
What about Mion?

00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:24.510
[OOISHI]
We found her as well.

00:22:24.552 --> 00:22:28.013
Her body turned up
alongside that of Satoko Hojo.

00:22:31.809 --> 00:22:36.355
[OOISHI] They died in a hallway
of the Sonozaki mansion.

00:22:36.397 --> 00:22:37.773
Basically,

00:22:37.815 --> 00:22:40.901
we got a whole damn
pile of bodies dropped on us.

00:22:40.943 --> 00:22:43.112
A few years' worth
of homicide cases

00:22:43.153 --> 00:22:45.739
just cropped up in
the course of a single day.

00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:49.285
Which means, sadly,
there's a good chance

00:22:49.326 --> 00:22:51.704
I'll be needing to ask
you some questions,

00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:54.623
and if I do, I sincerely
hope you can help me.

00:22:54.665 --> 00:22:56.959
In return, I promise
I'll keep you in the loop.

00:22:57.001 --> 00:22:59.920
If I find anything out,
I'll tell you.

00:22:59.962 --> 00:23:01.213
We'll talk again soon.

00:23:01.255 --> 00:23:02.882
Take care, all right?

00:23:06.552 --> 00:23:08.888
[KEIICHI] Mion told me
that her family's safe room

00:23:08.929 --> 00:23:11.390
was the most secure
place in the village,

00:23:11.432 --> 00:23:13.309
but Shion's body was there.

00:23:19.607 --> 00:23:21.692
When Rika disappeared,

00:23:21.734 --> 00:23:24.194
I went with Mion to look for her

00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:27.364
right near where
they found her body.

00:23:30.117 --> 00:23:32.369
[KEIICHI]
It doesn't seem right.

00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:36.498
It feels like Mion was
the one who killed everyone!

00:23:42.338 --> 00:23:43.589
Did Mion lure me down there

00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:47.718
and lock me in that cell to
protect me from some conspiracy?

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.637
Or was she...?

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:56.685
