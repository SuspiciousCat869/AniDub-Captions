YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

474
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,613
YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE I'M
WEAKER THAN HIM, WHICH I'M NOT.

475
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,382
YOU'RE JUST UPSET WITH RYO
BECAUSE YOU CAME IN SECOND,

476
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,384
BUT IT'S NOT HIS FAULT
YOU PLAYED BADLY.

477
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:13,952
KAZU!

478
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,522
YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT PAST THE
THIRD ROUND OF THAT TOURNAMENT.

479
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,123
YOU TALK BIG,

480
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,592
BUT YOU WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITH A DIGIMON

481
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,494
EVEN IF YOU COULD GET ONE,
WHICH YOU CAN'T!

482
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,097
OKAY. RELAX.
I DO REMEMBER YOU.

483
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,598
WELL, GEE, THANKS.

484
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,835
THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME,
OH, GREAT ONE.

485
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,503
YOU WERE GOOD.

486
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:32,805
STILL AM.

487
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,640
Kazu: AREN'T YOU
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

488
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,642
HE DID SAVE KYUBIMON TODAY,
YOU KNOW.

489
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,677
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN SERIOUS
TROUBLE WITHOUT HIM.

490
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,679
I DON'T REMEMBER ASKING
FOR HERO BOY'S HELP.

491
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,182
LISTEN, IT JUST LOOKED LIKE YOU
WERE IN TROUBLE, SO I --

492
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,817
YEAH, WELL, I WASN'T.

493
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,653
SO, I TAKE IT YOU GUYS DON'T
KNOW HOW TO GET OUT OF HERE?

494
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,655
NO. KENTA DOESN'T REALLY KNOW
MUCH OF ANYTHING.

495
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,090
HEY, CHEAP SHOT.

496
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,092
YOU NOTICE
HE DOESN'T DENY IT?

497
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,760
I CAN GET YOU HOME,

498
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,662
BUT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH
ANOTHER DIMENSION FIRST.

499
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,731
WE HAVE TO FIND OUR
OTHER FRIENDS.

500
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,232
I CAN HELP WITH THAT, TOO.

501
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,068
IT'S NICE TO MEET NEW PEOPLE,
MAKE NEW FRIENDS --

502
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,703
WELL, SOMETIMES.

503
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:05,738
HMPH.

504
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,040
WE GET TO TRAVEL WITH
THE RYO AKIYAMA.

505
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,708
ISN'T THAT AWESOME, KENTA?!

506
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:12,111
YEAH. UH, IS THAT OKAY
WITH YOU, RIKA?

507
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,680
I DON'T SEE WHY WE NEED
THIS GUY AT ALL.

508
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,616
HOW DO WE KNOW THERE'S NO DIRECT
WAY TO THE REAL WORLD?

509
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,552
I BET THERE IS, AND HE JUST
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW IT.

510
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,521
WHY WOULD I LIE ABOUT THAT?

511
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,723
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M NOT
STICKING AROUND TO FIND OUT.

512
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,091
KYUBIMON.

513
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,694
UH, WHAT DID I DO
TO GET HER SO UPSET?

514
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,229
WHO KNOWS?

515
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,798
SHE'S WEIRD -- ALWAYS CALLING US
"STUPID" AND STUFF.

516
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,233
SHE THINKS SHE'S BETTER.

517
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,268
YOU'RE ALWAYS CALLING
MSTUPID.

518
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,669
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

519
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,304
IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY?

520
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,640
IT'S TOUGH TO SAY. THERE'S A LOT
OF DANGEROUS STUFF THERE.

521
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,742
ONE MISSTEP,
AND SHE'S IN TROUBLE.

522
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,178
MAN, I THOUGHT THESE GUYS WEE
SUPPOSED TO FIND EACH OTHE,

523
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,746
NOT SPLIT UP EVEN MORE!

524
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,748
SO, SEE IF THEY GET BACK
TOGETHER

525
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,617
ON THE NEXT
"DIGIMON: DIGITAL MONSTERS"
