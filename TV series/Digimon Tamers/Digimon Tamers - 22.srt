got attack cards,

upgrade cards.

cards; we'll use them a lot.

gets as good as Rika,

all our cards.

lose most of your cards to me?

00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,210
to keep a strong
card in reserve.

Leomon will ever come back?

if he doesn't you'll find a
better digimon.

you doing here anyway?

try talking to him, guys.
