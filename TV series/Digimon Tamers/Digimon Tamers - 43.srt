00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,410
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE IT CAN'T BE DESTROYED.

315
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,580
Takato: STOP HERE.

316
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,049
SEE THAT LITTLE GUY
FLYING AROUND?

317
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,952
MAYBE IT'S THE D-REAPER
AND THE REST IS JUST ITS FIELD.

318
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,020
SO WE MAY NOT HAVE TO
FIGHT THE WHOLE THING,
