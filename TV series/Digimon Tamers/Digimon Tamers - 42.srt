AND BOTH CONTAIN
LIVING CREATURES,

317
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,462
SO PERHAPS THERE'S NO
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEM AT ALL,

318
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,364
AND NO REAL BORDER.

319
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,334
TAKATO, CAN I TAKE THIS OFF?
I'M HOT.

320
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,670
WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
GUILMON.

321
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,138
WELL, I SURE DO.

322
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:48,341
I FEEL LIKE A BIG OLD
BOILING LOBSTER UNDER HERE.

323
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,310
YOU KIND OF LOOK LIKE ONE.
HEY!

324
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,245
OH, WHAT THE HECK?
THERE'S NO ONE AROUND.

325
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,214
GO AHEAD.

326
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,851
WOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THIS PLACE IS EMPTY.

327
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,155
YEAH, ALL THE SANE PEOPLE
HAVE LEFT.

328
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,123
DO YOU THINK
WE CAN BEAT THE D-REAPER?

329
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,959
I DON'T KNOW, BUDDY,

330
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,860
BUT WE GOT TO TRY.

331
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,901
Rika: THAT'S NOT GOING
TO STOP ANYONE.

332
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,007
Guilmon: HOW ARE WE GOING
TO GET PAST THOSE GUYS?

333
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,076
Takato: I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH A PLAN.

334
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,044
OOH.
WHAT? DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA?

335
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,047
NO, I JUST LIKE IT WHEN
WE COME UP WITH PLANS. HA HA.

336
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,582
GUILMON.

337
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,217
SORRY.

338
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,353
MAYBE YOU CAN DIGIVOLVE
AND BREAK THROUGH.

339
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,088
NO, THAT'S NOT
GOING TO WORK.

340
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,589
IF WE DO THAT,

341
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,092
THEY'LL PROBABLY JUST THINK
THAT WE'RE THE ENEMY,

342
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,561
AND THEY ALREADY
DON'T TRUST DIGIMON.

343
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,563
BUT IF THERE'S
NO OTHER WAY,

344
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,732
THEN MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST GO AHEAD AND DIGIVOLVE.

345
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,899
WAIT A SEC.

346
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,035
JUST GIVE ME
SOME TIME TO THINK.

347
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,570
HMM.

348
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:51,571
MM...

349
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:52,905
IS THAT ENOUGH TIME?

350
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,140
GUILMON!

351
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,109
I'M PRETTY SURE
TAKATO'S GONE DOWN THERE,

352
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,777
AND I KNOW RIKA'S THERE.

353
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,212
AND YOU WANT
TO GO, TOO?

354
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,581
YES, BUT AFTER TALKING
TO SENSEI, I'M ALL CONFUSED.

355
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,217
I MEAN, I KNOW THAT
THE D-REAPER HAS TO BE STOPPED,

356
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,185
BUT HOW CAN I BE SURE
THAT FIGHTING IT

357
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,054
OR WHATEVER
IS THE RIGHT THING?

358
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,589
PLUS, I TOLD DAD
I WOULDN'T GO.

359
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,057
SO WHAT
ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

360
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,259
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T THINK I HAVE A CHOICE.

361
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,729
NO CHOICE? OF COURSE
YOU HAVE A CHOICE, HENRY.

362
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,364
YOU DON'T AUTOMATICALLY
HAVE TO RUSH OUT

363
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,033
AND PUT YOURSELF
INTO DANGER, YOU KNOW.

364
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,201
I MEAN, YOU COULD GET
SERIOUSLY HURT OUT THERE.

365
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,236
ALL OF YOU COULD.

366
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,203
OH, MOM.

367
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,906
THE CHOICES YOU MAKE
AFFECT OTHER PEOPLE.

368
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,574
SOMETIMES
IT AFFECTS THEM GREATLY,

369
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,276
LIKE WHEN THEY HAVE TO
SIT HOME WORRYING

370
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,212
ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE
HAPPENING TO YOU, HENRY.

371
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,147
MOM, I --

372
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,150
WHAT?

373
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,651
MOM, I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT ME,

374
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,820
BUT BELIEVE ME,
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES

375
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,156
WHO KNOW WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST
IN SHINJUKU.

376
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,826
ONLY TAKATO, RIKA, AND I HAVE
A REAL SHOT AT BEATING IT.

377
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,961
WE CAN'T JUST SIT BACK
AND IGNORE IT

378
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,430
AND HOPE THAT THIS THING
WILL GO AWAY,

379
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,465
BECAUSE
IT'S NOT GOING TO.

380
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,300
OH, HENRY.

381
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,203
I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU
WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

382
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,971
IT'S JUST AMAZING TO ME.

383
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:02,075
EVERY DAY, YOU SEEM TO GET
MORE AND MORE LIKE YOUR FATHER.

384
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,110
AND THAT'S BAD?

385
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,780
NO, IT'S GOOD. IT JUST
SOMETIMES GETS YOU INTO TROUBLE.

386
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,215
THERE WAS ONE TIME

387
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,817
WHEN YOUR FATHER
WAS JUST STARTING OUT,

388
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,252
JUST TRYING TO BUILD
A NAME FOR HIMSELF.

389
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,621
THIS POOR FRIEND OF HIS
WAS LIVING IN HONG KONG,

390
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,290
AND HIS HOUSE BURNED DOWN.

391
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,293
YOUR FATHER
DIDN'T HESITATE ONE BIT.

392
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,627
HE QUIT HIS JOB,

393
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,629
EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T KNOW
IF HE COULD GET ANOTHER ONE,

394
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,098
THEN WENT TO HELP.

395
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:28,134
SAID HE COULDN'T
CALL HIMSELF A FRIEND OTHERWISE.

396
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,137
HERE'S A COPY
OF THE LOG FILE.

397
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,438
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

398
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:36,109
WHY DID IT ATTACK HYPNOS
AND APPEAR HERE?

399
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,344
DID HYPNOS MARK A WEAK POINT
BETWEEN THE WORLDS,

400
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,046
OR DID HYPNOS
ENABLE IT TO APPEAR?

401
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,015
MAYBE THIS IS
ALL MY FAULT.

402
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,017
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

403
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,219
SO I GUESS
I CAN'T FAULT YOU

404
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,987
FOR WANTING
TO HELP YOUR FRIENDS.

405
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,155
YEAH?

406
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,690
BUT I STILL
DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

407
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,158
OH.

408
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,193
HENRY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

409
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,996
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO
GO OUT AND SAVE THE WORLD,

410
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,898
BUT WE JUST GOT YOU BACK,

411
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:02,802
AND I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN STAND
THE THOUGHT OF LOSING YOU AGAIN.

412
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,270
A BATH?
I DON'T NEED ONE.

413
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,140
PERFECT!
YOU SOUND JUST LIKE ME.

414
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,875
PSST.
HMM?

415
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,843
YOU'RE LEAVING?

416
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:14,180
HENRY, IF YOU HAVE TO GO,
THEN GO.

417
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,848
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL BE FINE.

418
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,184
I HOPE SO, HENRY.
I REALLY DO.

419
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,186
[ SOBBING ]

420
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:24,190
I LOVE YOU, MOM.
I JUST HAVE TO GO.

421
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,692
JUST REMEMBER THAT, OKAY?

422
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,330
MAKE SURE TO STAY
BEHIND THE TANK, MEN.

423
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,332
IT'LL PROTECT YOU
IF THAT THING ATTACKS.

424
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,668
SIR, BUT WHAT ABOUT US GUYS
TRAPPED INSIDE THE TANK

425
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,103
WHEN IT ATTACKS?

426
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,338
ALL RIGHT, CUT THE CHATTER.
WE'RE GETTING CLOSE.

427
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:40,840
YES, SIR,

428
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,910
BUT DO WE HAVE TO
GET THIS CLOSE?

429
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,914
JERI?

430
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,016
JERI, WHERE ARE YOU?

431
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,251
VROOM. VROOM!

432
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,388
MASAHIKO, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE JERI IS?

433
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,789
SHE WENT OUT SOMEWHERE.

434
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,258
OUT SOMEWHERE?
OUTSIDE?

435
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,359
NO, THERE.

436
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:03,062
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THE LAUNDRY ROOM?

437
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,200
WELL, IF YOU PUT IT
THAT WAY...

438
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,368
HELLO? JERI?

439
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:14,040
JERI, ARE YOU BACK THERE?

440
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,444
THIS ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE.

441
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,079
IF YOU'RE JUST HIDING,

442
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,015
I'M GOING TO BE
VERY UPSET WITH YOU.

443
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,150
JERI?

444
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,928
MEN, WE'RE ABOUT TO WALK
INTO THE BELLY OF THE BEAST,

445
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,730
BUT STAY STRONG.

446
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,766
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
YOU'LL EVER DO.

447
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,768
SIR, I'M GETTING
SOME WEIRD READINGS HERE.

448
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:46,739
THE BATTERY LEVEL'S
ALL OVER THE PLACE, AND I'M --

449
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,074
HEY! AAH!

450
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,475
MAN DOWN! MAN DOWN!

451
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,811
IT'S ATTACKING!
MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION!

452
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,746
HERE WE GO.

453
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:54,981
HERE?

454
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,483
YEAH. DON'T YOU REMEMBER?
WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.

455
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,685
IT CONNECTS TO THAT
BIG UNDERGROUND WATERWAY.

456
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:00,753
OH, YEAH.

457
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,755
BIG SCARY
UNDERGROUND WATERWAY.

458
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:06,792
WHENEVER I GO IN HERE, IT SEEMS
LIKE SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS.

459
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,928
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
NO ONE'S GUARDING IT,

460
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,763
BUT THAT
WORKS OUT GREAT FOR US.

461
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,798
THIS'LL TAKE US ALL THE WAY
TO THE CENTER OF THE PARK.

462
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,734
I JUST HOPE
THAT THE D-REAPER

463
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,503
DOESN'T HAVE A TRAP OR SOMETHING
WAITING FOR US DOWN HERE.

464
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,171
WELL, I'M NOT SCARED.

465
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,840
THEN NEITHER AM I.

466
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,408
HEY, GOGGLE-HEAD!

467
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,411
YOU WEREN'T THINKING OF GOING
WITHOUT ME, WERE YOU?

468
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:26,646
RIKA! HA HA HA.

469
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,648
NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT.

470
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,583
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING
DOWN IN THAT TUNNEL, THEN?

471
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,152
OH, WELL, SEE, GUILMON AND I
WERE GOING TO FIND A PHONE

472
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,321
TO CALL YOU AND --
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

473
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,956
YOU WERE JUST GOING
TO GO OFF TO THE D-REAPER

474
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,624
WITHOUT CALLING ME,
WEREN'T YOU?

475
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,526
GUILTY.

476
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:41,861
WELL, COME ON.

477
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,496
WHAT ABOUT ME?

478
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,797
HENRY!

479
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,831
Terriermon:
WHAT ABOUT ME?

480
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:46,832
YEAH, YOU TOO.

481
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:47,800
THAT'S BETTER.

482
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,336
WELL, HURRY UP ALREADY.

483
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,338
YEAH! HA HA HA HA.

484
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:53,973
WHAT, YOU THINK WE'D TRY
TO DO THIS BY OURSELVES?

485
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,908
Rika: WE'D NEVER DO THAT.

486
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,377
FUNNY, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE DOING.

487
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,879
WHAT? UNH-UNH.

488
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,148
Takato: UH-OH. THE JACKET
IS COMING OFF.

489
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,684
THAT'S RIGHT, BOYS.
PLAYTIME'S OVER.

490
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:05,952
HEY. YOU ALL RIGHT?

491
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:07,853
YEAH. WHAT WAS THAT?

492
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,022
SHAKE IT OFF, SON.
WE'VE GOT A JOB TO DO.

493
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,459
QUICK, MEN,

494
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,994
THIS MIGHT BE OUR CHANCE
TO SURPRISE THAT THING.

495
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,496
ALL RIGHT, STAY SHARP
AND MOVE OUT.

496
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,666
Guilmon: WELL, NOTHING BAD'S
HAPPENED SO FAR,

497
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,234
BUT IT'S STILL SCARY.

498
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,971
Renamon: WAIT TILL
WE FACE THE D-REAPER.

499
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,672
OH, WHY'D YOU HAVE TO GO
AND REMIND US OF THAT?

500
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,975
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO COME UP
WITH A PLAN TO HANDLE IT.

501
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:30,910
YOU MEAN BEATING UP ON IT
ISN'T PLAN ENOUGH?

502
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,879
IF IT FRIGHTENS A SOVEREIGN,
IT IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.

503
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,215
IT CAN'T BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.
IT'S THE SIZE OF A HOUSE!

504
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,384
I THINK RENAMON'S RIGHT,
TERRIERMON.

505
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,886
I MEAN, SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
RIGHT BEFORE, SO WHY NOT NOW?

506
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,855
WHY, THANK YOU.

507
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,857
RENAMON AND GUILMON,
SITTIN' IN A TREE.

508
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,526
AAH! [ Humming ]

509
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,862
[ Thinks ]
UM, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

510
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,864
WELL, WHAT?

511
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,066
OH, NOTHING.

512
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,635
MM-HMM.

513
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:56,969
[ Thinking ]
JUST KEEP WALKING,

514
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,237
PRETEND SHE'S NOT
STARING AT YOU,

515
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,705
AND KEEP QUIET.

516
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:00,906
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT
THAT SHIRT LOOKS GOOD.

517
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,875
[ Thinks ] OH, GREAT JOB
OF KEEPING QUIET.

518
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:06,412
[ Thinks ]
HMM, JUST KEEP WALKING.

519
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,589
EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT. RELAX.
THEY'RE JUST SITTING THERE.

520
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,392
AW, NUTS!

521
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,894
MOVE IT! MOVE IT!

522
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,863
AND GIVE ME AIR SUPPORT NOW!

523
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,398
SIR, YES, SIR!

524
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,733
Takato: THAT SURE WAS
A LONG TUNNEL.

525
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,069
Guilmon: SOME OF US ARE
STILL WORKING ON THE STAIRS.

526
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,871
[ ALL GASP ]

527
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,806
HMM?

528
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,975
HEY, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE FIREWORKS.

529
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,710
OH, NO.

530
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,311
DOES THIS MEAN
WE'RE TOO LATE?

531
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,013
Henry: I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'LL
TELL YOU WHAT IT DOES MEAN...

532
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,952
NOW WE HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE D-REAPER AND THE ARMY.

533
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,621
GREAT. TWICE AS MUCH FUN.

534
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,956
WHAT ARE THOSE BIRDS?

535
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,925
THE D-REAPER?

536
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,460
WE KNOW SO LITTLE
ABOUT IT.

537
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,430
[ Thinks ] YEAH, EXCEPT THAT
IT CAN DESTROY US ALL.

538
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,799
MAN, THE D-REAPER'S
GUNNING FOR THEM,

539
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,934
AND WHAT IF THE ARMY THINKS
THEY'RE THE BAD GUYS?

540
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,269
SEE WHAT HAPPENS

541
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,971
ON THE NEXT "DIGIMON --
DIGITAL MONSTERS."
