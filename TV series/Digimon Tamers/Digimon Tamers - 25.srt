481
00:18:20,074 --> 00:18:22,109
THAT THEY SAW
MAKURAMON BUT NOT CALUMON?

482
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,777
LISTEN UP.

483
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,980
ARE YOU LYING TO US
ABOUT SEEING THAT MONKEY?

484
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:28,449
LYING? WHAT IS LYING?

485
00:18:28,449 --> 00:18:30,150
MY TURN.

486
00:18:30,184 --> 00:18:32,820
NOW, YOU REMEMBER SEEING
MAKURAMON, RIGHT?

487
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:34,188
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.

488
00:18:34,255 --> 00:18:37,191
GOOD. OKAY, WHERE?

489
00:18:37,258 --> 00:18:39,560
[ GASPS ] [ GASPS ]
[ GASPS ] [ GASPS ]

490
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:41,996
ALL RIGHT!
WHICH WAY DID HE GO?

491
00:18:42,062 --> 00:18:44,131
THAT WAY.

492
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:48,435
HE'S OVER THERE IN THE DESERT
WHERE ALL THOSE BIG LIGHTS ARE.

493
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,919
URRRRGGGG.

494
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:07,321
I TOLD YOU I'D BE BACK.

495
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,989
AND NOW...

496
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,357
URRRGGGG!

497
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:13,928
HOW DARE YOU DEFY ME,
YOU LITTLE TWERP!

498
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:15,930
Takato: OH, MAN.
WHAT A DAY, HUH?

499
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:17,731
WE'VE BEEN DROPPED, LOST,

500
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:19,733
STARVED, ATTACKED, AND
STAMPEDED.

501
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,802
Kazu:
YEAH, IF WE WERE BACK HOME,

502
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,706
I'D BE IN SOCIAL STUDIES RIGHT
NOW, CATCHING UP ON MY SLEEP.

503
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:27,708
Rika: IT'S ONLY GOING TO
GET MORE INTENSE.

504
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:29,743
WE HAVEN'T EVEN FACED
MAKURAMON YET.

505
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:32,346
WE'LL BE READY FOR HIM, AND
WE'LL GET CALUMON BACK, TOO.

506
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,381
Henry: YEAH,
BUT AT WHAT PRICE?

507
00:19:34,415 --> 00:19:36,817
YOU SAW
WHAT HAPPENED TO MERAMON.

508
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,420
GUILMON, I WANT YOU TO BE
REALLY, REALLY CAREFUL

509
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,188
WHILE WE'RE HERE, OKAY?

510
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,823
NO FUNNY STUFF.

511
00:19:42,856 --> 00:19:44,825
YOU GOT TO PROMISE
ME SOMETHING --

512
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:46,794
THAT NOTHING BAD
WILL HAPPEN.

513
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:49,063
NOTHING BAD'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
DON'T WORRY.

514
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:50,998
BUT PROMISE ME.

515
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:52,132
I PROMISE.

516
00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:54,802
NOW, ABOUT THAT BREAD...

517
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:56,170
GUYS, LOOK OUT!

518
00:19:56,203 --> 00:19:57,304
WHAT NOW?

519
00:19:57,304 --> 00:19:58,372
BEHIND YOU!

520
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:01,809
Renamon:
IT'S A DATA STREAM.

521
00:20:01,842 --> 00:20:03,477
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

522
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,145
NOT GOOD AT ALL.

523
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:07,114
SHOULDN'T WE BE
RUNNING BY NOW?

524
00:20:07,147 --> 00:20:08,983
YEAH, LET'S GO.

525
00:20:08,983 --> 00:20:10,985
COME ON!

526
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:13,153
WHOA!  WHOA!

527
00:20:16,323 --> 00:20:18,926
Terriermon:
GET THE LEAD OUT, HENRY!

528
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:21,895
GUYS, YOU'RE RUNNING
THE WRONG WAY.

529
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,897
RENAMON, WE HAVE TO
GO AFTER THEM.

530
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:24,598
RIGHT.

531
00:20:30,004 --> 00:20:31,939
RIKA!

532
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:34,208
ARE YOU OKAY?

533
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:36,377
IF THAT THING HITS THEM, WE MAY
NEVER FIND THEM AGAIN.

534
00:20:40,014 --> 00:20:41,982
THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL.

535
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:43,884
WILL RIKA AND THE GUYS BE BLOWN

536
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,819
TO THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE DIGITAL WORLD?

537
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:48,222
FIND OUT ON THE NEXT
"DIGIMON: DIGITAL MONSTERS."
