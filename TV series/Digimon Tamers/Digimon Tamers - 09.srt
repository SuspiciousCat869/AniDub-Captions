00:19:44,824 --> 00:19:46,826
TERRIERMON, WE WANTED HIM
TO BLEND IN,

482
00:19:46,826 --> 00:19:48,328
NOT STICK OUT
LIKE A SORE THUMB.

483
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:50,797
WELL, HE'D BLEND IN FINE
IF HE WERE IN THE SKY,

484
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,665
WOULDN'T HE?

485
00:19:52,665 --> 00:19:55,034
OH, I GOT TO EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING TO YOU.

486
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:57,670
AHH. HUH?

487
00:19:57,704 --> 00:19:59,339
WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO GROWLMON, HENRY?

488
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:01,674
THOSE FLECKS OF LIGHT
MUST BE DIGITAL MATTER,

489
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:02,742
AND IT LOOKS THE RAINBOW

490
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:04,344
IS PULLING THEM
OUT OF HIM,

491
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:07,747
OR MAYBE THE SUN'S JUST
KIND OF DRYING HIM OUT.

492
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:09,816
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S WEIRD.

493
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:11,284
NOT AS WEIRD AS WHAT
I FOUND

494
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:12,719
BETWEEN GROWLMON'S TOES
WHEN WE WERE PAINTING HIM.

495
00:20:12,752 --> 00:20:13,787
TRUE.

496
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,821
WHOA!

497
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:16,890
GROWLMON!
I MEAN, GUILMON,

498
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,258
WHOEVER YOU ARE!

499
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,760
YOU'RE BACK TO BEING
GUILMON!

500
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:23,696
THINGS ARE FINALLY NORMAL AGAIN.

501
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,864
YEAH.

502
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:26,866
WELL, AS NORMAL AS THEY GET.

503
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,768
SO, WE NEED TO FIND
A RAINBOW

504
00:20:28,835 --> 00:20:31,738
EVERY TIME HE WANTS
TO CHANGE BACK TO GUILMON?

505
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:33,740
HOW COME NO ONE WANTS
TO ANSWER ME TODAY?

506
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:37,210
DOES TAKATO NEED AN INSTRUCTION
MENU FOR GUILMON, OR WHAT?

507
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:40,680
I WONDER IF THESE GUYS WILL
EVER FIGURE OUT THEIR PARTNERS.

508
00:20:40,713 --> 00:20:42,749
STAY TUNED TO "DIGIMON --
DIGITAL MONSTERS."
