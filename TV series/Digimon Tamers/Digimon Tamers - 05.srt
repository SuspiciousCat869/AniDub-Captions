486
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,015
YOU CAN BE REPLACED,
YOU KNOW.

487
00:19:57,015 --> 00:19:59,851
LOOK AT THAT!
WHOA!

488
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:01,352
IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE
A SCHOOL PROJECT OR SOMETHING?

489
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:04,022
YEAH, IT'S A HOUSING COMPLEX
FOR LOW-INCOME GOPHERS.

490
00:20:04,055 --> 00:20:06,224
I BET IT'S A PRANK
BY THE SHOT PUT TEAM.

491
00:20:06,257 --> 00:20:08,854
ALL THAT LIFTING AND THROWING
HAS JARRED THEIR BRAINS.

492
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:11,470
WHY ME?

493
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,839
IT WAS ALIEN GHOSTS.

494
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:16,040
ALIEN GHOSTS AND GNOMES
THAT TRAVEL THROUGH TIME.

495
00:20:17,073 --> 00:20:19,442
YOU KNOW, THEY PROBABLY
WOULDN'T EVEN BELIEVE US

496
00:20:19,475 --> 00:20:20,923
IF WE TOLD THEM
THE TRUTH.

497
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:23,721
I KNOW.

498
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:24,686
JEEZ, HOW MANY TIMES

499
00:20:24,686 --> 00:20:26,654
ARE THESE GUYS
GOING TO TRASH THE SCHOOL,

500
00:20:26,654 --> 00:20:28,758
AND WHAT IS THE DEAL
WITH REIKA, ANYWAY?

501
00:20:28,758 --> 00:20:30,393
BETTER KEEP WATCHING
"DIGIMON -- DIGITAL MONSTERS."
