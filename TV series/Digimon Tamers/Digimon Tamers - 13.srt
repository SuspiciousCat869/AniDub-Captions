IS TO COMPLETELY
ELIMINATE THEM

THE DIGIMON'S OWN DATA
AGAINST THEM.

329

FOR HESITATION.

'CAUSE YOU'RE --

475
00:18:07,027 --> 00:18:08,529
WHAT'S THE WORD
I'M LOOKING FOR?

476
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:09,663
OH, YEAH, PATHETIC.

477
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:12,399
IMPMON, IS THERE ANYONE
YOU DO LIKE?

478
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:14,869
NAH. YOU PRETTY MUCH
ALL MAKE ME SICK.

479
00:18:14,902 --> 00:18:16,871
WHAT A YOUNG DIGIMON
LIKE YOU NEEDS

480
00:18:16,871 --> 00:18:18,706
ISN'T FRIENDS,
BUT SOME GOOD ADVICE,

481
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,007
AND IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY,

482
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,376
'CAUSE I'M IN THE SHARING
KIND OF MOOD.

483
00:18:22,376 --> 00:18:23,677
LIFE, MY FRIEND,
IS ALL ABOUT

484
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:24,778
THE SURVIVAL
OF THE FITTEST.

485
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,680
THAT'S WHEN THE BEST
AND THE BRIGHTEST --

00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:27,982
THAT'S ME --
WIPES THE FLOOR

487
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:29,617
WITH THE MEEK
AND THE WEAK. THAT'S YOU.

488
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,118
SO IF I BLAST YOU
TO KINGDOM COME

489
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,853
AND ABSORB YOUR DATA
LIKE I'M PLANNING ON DOING,

490
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,988
DON'T TAKE IT PERSONAL.

491
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:34,955
IT'S NATURE
TAKING ITS COURSE.

492
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,690
OHH!

493

OPERATION JUGGERNAUT INITIATE.

494
00:18:39,927 --> 00:18:41,729
I'M GETTING
AN ABNORMAL READING.

495
00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:43,130
SIR, IS THIS ALL PART

496
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,900
OF THE PROJECT WE'RE TESTING --
THE JUGGERNAUT?

497
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:48,102
YES, BUT IT'S NOTHING
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT.

498
00:18:48,102 --> 00:18:49,770
WE'RE JUST GIVING IT
A TEST RUN.

499
00:18:49,803 --> 00:18:51,939
USING DATA FROM THE DIGIMON
WE'VE CAPTURED,

500
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:54,475
I'VE CONSTRUCTED A DIGIMON
COMPOSITE TO ACT AS BAIT.

501
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:56,877
INSTEAD OF US HUNTING FOR THEM,
THEY'LL COME TO US.

502
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:59,079
YOU'RE BRILLIANT, SIR.

503
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:01,815
WELL, THAT'S YOUR FIRST
ACCURATE OBSERVATION.

504
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,784
HEY, GUILMON, NOW THAT
WE'RE BACK ON TRACK,

505
00:19:03,817 --> 00:19:05,753
I HAVE ALL THESE ATTACKS
I WANT TO TRY.

506
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:07,955
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE
A TEAM NAME, TOO,

507
00:19:07,988 --> 00:19:09,857
LIKE AWESOME TWOSOME
OR DYNAMITE DUO.

508
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:10,958
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

509
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:12,426
[ RUMBLING ]

510
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:13,928
AN EARTHQUAKE?

511
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:15,796
IT'S COMING.

512
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:18,766
DINNERTIME, EVERYONE.
WHO WANTS TAKEOUT?

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,434
I DO, I DO, I DO!
[ Giggles ]

514
00:19:20,434 --> 00:19:22,436
HEY, DAD. SMELLS GREAT.
I'M STARVING.

515
00:19:22,436 --> 00:19:23,804
NOW, NO SMART COMMENTS

516
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,773
ABOUT HOW THIS STUFF'S BETTER
THAN MY COOKING.

517
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:27,775
SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT,
FRIED FROG

518
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,910
OR PICKLED PIG FEET?
MMM, MMM.

519
00:19:29,944 --> 00:19:33,714
OH, DAD, GIVE ME A BREAK.
I'M NOT EATING FRIED FROG.

520
00:19:33,747 --> 00:19:35,616
YOU NEVER KNOW.
YOU MIGHT LIKE IT.

521
00:19:35,616 --> 00:19:36,817
HEY, UH, DAD...

522
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:38,652
DON'T WORRY.
I MADE THAT UP,

523
00:19:38,652 --> 00:19:40,688
BUT DON'T TELL
YOUR SISTER, OKAY?

524
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,723
ACTUALLY, I WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT THAT DIGIMON PROJECT

525
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:44,925
YOU USED TO WORK ON.

526
00:19:44,992 --> 00:19:46,961
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT LATER,
OKAY, SON?

527
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:48,162
OH, OKAY.

528
00:19:48,162 --> 00:19:51,532
SO WHERE'S THE FROG?

529
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,033
WHAT?

530
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,436
AAH!

531
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:57,771

00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:02,009
CAN'T RESIST IT!

00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,745
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO YOU?

535
00:20:04,778 --> 00:20:06,280
OPERATION JUGGERNAUT ACTIVATED.

[ Thinking ] THOSE DIGIMON WON'T
KNOW WHAT HIT THEM.

539
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:19,793
LET'S SEE THE KIDDIES
DEAL WITH THIS.

TAKATO,
SOMETHING'S COMING --

542
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,733
A DIGIMON,
AND HE'S REALLY BIG.

543
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:27,601
OHH.

544
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:31,105
UH-OH. I HOPE TAKATO AND GUILMON
AREN'T IN OVER THEIR HEADS.

545
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:32,906
TO FIND OUT,

546
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:35,242
BETTER KEEP WATCHING
