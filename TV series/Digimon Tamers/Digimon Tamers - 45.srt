YAMAKI -- I MEAN SIR!

00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:55,219
LOOK, IT'S THE DIGIMON.

164
00:07:55,252 --> 00:07:57,354
THEY'RE FIGHTING
THE D-REAPER'S AGENTS AGAIN.

165
00:07:57,388 --> 00:07:58,522
THEY'VE COME BACK?

166
00:07:58,555 --> 00:08:00,124
THE CHILDREN --

167
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:02,826
WE CAN'T JUST LET THEM FIGHT
THAT THING ON THEIR OWN.

168
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,828
MEGA BARRAGE!

169
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:13,971
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME WAY
WE CAN HELP THEM. THINK, GUYS.

170
00:08:14,037 --> 00:08:15,973
HOW'D A BUNCH OF HACKERS

171
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:17,941
GET MIXED UP
IN SO MUCH TROUBLE

172
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:20,043
OR CAUSE SO MUCH TROUBLE
FOR OUR CHILDREN?

173
00:08:20,077 --> 00:08:22,179
I'M SORRY, ALICE.

174
00:08:22,212 --> 00:08:24,181
Yamaki: JANYU?
I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

175
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:25,382
LIKE WHAT?

176
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,851
[ GRUNTS ]

MEGA BARRAGE!

179
00:08:36,093 --> 00:08:39,029
[ Thinking ]
GOODBYE, DOBERMON.

180
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:41,198
YOU DID SOMETHING
NO ONE ELSE COULD --

181
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:43,033
YOU GAVE THEM A CHANCE.

182
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,868
Janyu: I CAN'T JUST STAY HERE!

183
00:08:44,868 --> 00:08:46,437
JANYU,
YOU CAN'T HELP THEM NOW.

184
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,205
WASN'T IT YOU
WHO ALWAYS SAID

185
00:08:48,205 --> 00:08:50,340
THAT EACH PERSON
HAS THINGS THEY MUST DO,

186
00:08:50,374 --> 00:08:52,042
THINGS ONLY THEY CAN DO?

187
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:55,245
I KNOW,
BUT THEY'RE CHILDREN.

188
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:58,449
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES CAPABLE
OF FIGHTING THE D-REAPER.

189
00:08:58,482 --> 00:09:00,184
Man: THE DIGIMON
HAVE RESUMED THEIR ATTACK,

190
00:09:00,184 --> 00:09:02,352
BUT IT IS UNCLEAR
WHO HAS THE UPPER HAND.

00:09:02,386 --> 00:09:05,522
AMETHYST WIND!

192
00:09:05,522 --> 00:09:08,058
THE DIGIMON APPEAR
TO BE DOING SOME DAMAGE,

193
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:10,194
BUT THE DANGER FOR THEM
REMAINS EXTREME.

YOU'VE ALREADY DONE
MORE THAN YOU THINK, JANYU.

YOU HELPED CREATE THE DIGIMON
THAT ARE OUT THERE FIGHTING.

198
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:28,846
WITHOUT YOUR CREATION,
THERE'D BE NO HOPE AT ALL.

199
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:31,348
AAH!

200
00:09:31,415 --> 00:09:32,749
LET'S GET HIM!

201
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:34,918
Terriermon: I'M GETTING,
I'M GETTING.

202

POWER PUMMEL!

203

WHAT YOU ALWAYS
TALKED ABOUT --

205
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:44,428
DIGIMON AND HUMANS,

206
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:46,597
BOTH OF THEM
WORKING TOGETHER IN HARMONY.

207
00:09:46,597 --> 00:09:48,599
TRUST IN THEM
TO WIN THE FIGHT.

208
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:50,267
I DO BELIEVE IN THEM,
IT'S JUST --

209
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:51,635
HE'S MY SON, YAMAKI.

210
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:53,103
I KNOW.

211
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,572
SO USE YOUR WEAPONS
AS A PROGRAMMER TO HELP HIM.

212
00:09:55,606 --> 00:09:57,107
WE NEED YOU HERE.

213
00:09:57,107 --> 00:09:59,409
WELL, THEN WHAT ARE WE
ALL DOING STANDING AROUND?

214
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:00,978
IF WE'RE GOING
TO STOP THAT THING

215
00:10:00,978 --> 00:10:03,146
OR AT LEAST GIVE THOSE KIDS
A FIGHTING CHANCE,

216
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,982
WE'D BETTER GET HACKING.

217
00:10:04,982 --> 00:10:07,151
THANKS, YAMAKI.

218
00:10:08,886 --> 00:10:10,787
Terriermon: HEY!
DID THAT ACTUALLY WORK?

219
00:10:10,821 --> 00:10:12,689
Henry: [ Sighs ]
OF COURSE NOT.

220
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:16,226
AAH!

221
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:19,263
AAH! IT'S GOT US!

222
00:10:21,598 --> 00:10:24,334
Takato: WHY DON'T THE BAD GUYS
EVER JUST STAY DOWN?

223
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:26,904
I'LL MAKE IT STAY DOWN.

224
00:10:26,937 --> 00:10:28,505
SPIRIT STRIKE!

225
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:42,219
Rika: IT SEEMS LIKE NO MATTER
HOW MANY OF THOSE THINGS

226
00:10:42,252 --> 00:10:45,355
WE TAKE DOWN,
MORE JUST TAKE THEIR PLACE.

227
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:46,857
THEN WE'LL KEEP
TAKING THEM DOWN.

228
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,226
THE BATTLE RAGES ON
WITH NO CLEAR VICTOR IN SIGHT.

229
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:51,261
HEY, DAISY,
REMEMBER THE ARK YOU PROGRAMMED

230
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:53,564
TO BRING THE CHILDREN HOME
FROM THE DIGITAL WORLD?

231
00:10:53,597 --> 00:10:55,199
MM-HMM.

232
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:56,567
DO YOU THINK
THERE'S ANY WAY

233
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,136
YOU COULD SOMEHOW REESTABLISH
A CONNECTION WITH IT?

234
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,802
I GUESS SO, BUT WHY?
IT'S POWERLESS NOW.

235
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:03,170
IT CONTACTED ME.

236
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,957
HUH?

237
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:05,525
THAT'S RIGHT.
I RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM IT

238
00:11:05,525 --> 00:11:08,161
ON MY HANDHELD
ASKING FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

239
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:10,163
THE ARK STILL HAS SOME POWER,
BUT NOT A LOT.

240
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,232
I THINK MAYBE
WE CAN STILL USE IT

241
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:13,400
AGAINST THE D-REAPER SOMEHOW.

242
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:14,835
MAYBE.

243
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:17,237
I'D LIKE THIS TO STAY BETWEEN US
UNTIL WE'RE SURE.

244
00:11:17,237 --> 00:11:20,073
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE
THE OTHERS FALSE HOPE.

245
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:22,576
OKAY. I'LL GET STARTED
ON IT RIGHT AWAY.

246
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:26,213
Man: SOME WONDER WHETHER
THESE DIGIMON ARE TRULY HELPFUL

247
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:27,914
OR WILL ULTIMATELY
TURN ON HUMANITY,

248
00:11:27,914 --> 00:11:30,250
BUT FOR NOW,
THE CITY HAS ADOPTED THE POLICY

249
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,885
"THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY
IS MY FRIEND"

250
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,821
AND IS WATCHING WARILY
TO SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT.

251
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:36,423
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

252
00:11:36,423 --> 00:11:37,824
THAT THEY DON'T KNOW
A GOOD THING WHEN THEY SEE IT.

253
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:39,726
Guardromon: KAZU,
I'M BEING ATTACKED!

254
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,295
OH! OH!

255
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:43,630
RUSTY BUCKET OF BOLTS!

256
00:11:43,664 --> 00:11:46,233
I TOLD YOU NOT TO STAND
ON MY FLOWER BED, DIDN'T I?

257
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,969
IS THIS NORMAL BEHAVIOR
FOR YOUR MOTHER?

258
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:52,172
I'M SURPRISED THAT YOU'RE
NOT ALL COVERED WITH DENTS.

259
00:11:52,205 --> 00:11:54,141
Man: WITH BOTH SIDES
TRADING VIOLENT VOLLEYS...

260
00:11:54,174 --> 00:11:57,144
EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT MEGA,
WE'VE GOT TO TRY TO HELP.

261
00:11:57,144 --> 00:11:59,479
THE BATTLE CONTINUES TO RAGE
WITH FEROCIOUS VIOLENCE,

262
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,381
SHAKING THE BUILDINGS
WITH EACH ATTACK.

263
00:12:01,415 --> 00:12:03,016
HENRY.

264
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:06,253
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

265
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:09,990
SUSIE, I CAN'T JUST SIT HERE
AND WATCH THIS ON TV ANYMORE.

266
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:12,326
WE CAN'T IGNORE
THIS BATTLE.

267
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:14,561
THOSE ARE OUR FRIENDS
AND OUR FAMILY

268
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:16,463
THAT ARE FIGHTING
OUT THERE, SUSIE.

269
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:17,964
THEY NEED HELP,

270
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:20,734
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN GIVE ME STRENGTH.

271
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:22,169
ME?

272
00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:25,305
YES. YOU'RE MY TAMER.
IT'S TIME TO ACT LIKE ONE.

273
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:27,307
OKAY.

274
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:31,478
DO I NEED A JACKET?

275
00:12:35,248 --> 00:12:37,150
NICE D-REAPER.

276
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,185
OH, NO!

277
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:40,454
HENRY!

278
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:42,489
GUILMON!
HE'LL BE ERASED!

279
00:12:44,424 --> 00:12:48,528
NOT IF I CAN HELP IT.
I JUST HOPE I'M NOT TOO LATE.

280
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:58,254
AAH!

281
00:12:58,254 --> 00:13:00,322
Guilmon: NO ONE'S
ERASING MY BUDDIES!

282
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:04,773
YOU OKAY?

283
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:07,175
Terriermon: OH, YEAH,
AND HERE'S A LITTLE GIFT

284
00:13:07,175 --> 00:13:09,678
TO SHOW THE D-REAPER
JUST HOW OKAY I AM!

285
00:13:09,711 --> 00:13:11,680
MEGA BARRAGE!

286
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:17,786
AAH!

287
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:26,895
SHIELD OF THE JUST!

288
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:29,765
AAH!

289
00:13:35,237 --> 00:13:36,772
Terriermon: WE ACTUALLY
DESTROYED THAT THING?

290
00:13:36,805 --> 00:13:38,907
THAT WAS EASIER
THAN I THOUGHT.

291
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:40,208
Henry: YEAH, RIGHT.

292
00:13:40,242 --> 00:13:41,576
Man: WITH A MIGHTY EXPLOSION,

293
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,579
IT LOOKS AS IF THE TIDE
OF THE BATTLE HAS TURNED

294
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,047
IN FAVOR OF THE DIGIMON,

295
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:47,549
BUT WE ARE STILL WAITING

296
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:48,817
FOR THE SMOKE TO CLEAR
TO BE CERTAIN.

297
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,085
THE QUESTION IS --

298
00:13:50,085 --> 00:13:52,187
CAN THESE DIGIMON
TRULY DEFEAT THIS ENTITY

299
00:13:52,187 --> 00:13:55,791
OR ARE THEY JUST SIMPLY
DELAYING THE INEVITABLE?

300
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,459
Gallantmon: SEE, D-REAPER?

301
00:13:57,492 --> 00:13:59,728
WE CAN TAKE
WHATEVER YOU THROW AT US,

302
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:02,764
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GIVE IT UP AND SURRENDER?

303
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:04,599
GALLANTMON,
WE CAN'T JUST TALK TO IT.

304
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:06,101
WE MUST DESTROY IT.

305
00:14:06,134 --> 00:14:09,571
SAKUYAMON'S RIGHT.
THE TIME FOR TALKING'S OVER.

306
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:13,074
Terriermon: THAT THING'S
STILL MOVING?

307
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:14,576
JEEZ, HOW MANY TIMES

308
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:16,912
DO WE HAVE TO DESTROY IT
BEFORE IT STAYS DESTROYED?

309
00:14:16,912 --> 00:14:20,916
KENTA, I MADE
P.B. AND J. FOR YOU.

310
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,184
KENTA?

311
00:14:24,252 --> 00:14:25,587
OH.

312
00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:28,623
KENTA?!

313
00:14:28,623 --> 00:14:30,959
Guilmon: D-REAPER,
THIS ENDS RIGHT NOW!

314
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,828
Takato: [ Thinks ] YEAH,
AND HOPEFULLY NOT FOR US.

315
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:35,630
HUH?

316
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:39,467
LET GO!

317
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:41,970
Takato: IT'S NO USE,
SAKUYAMON.

318
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:44,139
GET OUT OF HERE
