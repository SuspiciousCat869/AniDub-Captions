1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,203
TAKATO AND THE GANG
CAME FACE TO FACE

2
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:05,005
WITH THE D-REAPER SCOUTS
IN THE PARK

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,341
AND DECIDED TO RUN FOR IT.
THEY HID OUT IN THE SCHOOL,

4
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,877
AND THE NEXT MORNING WENT
TO TAKATO'S FAMILY BAKERY

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,012
TO COLLECT THEIR THOUGHTS
AND FILL THEIR STOMACHS.

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
MEANWHILE, IMPMON GOT SOME HELP
FROM SENSEI

7
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,516
AND WENT OFF TO FIND
HIS TAMERS AI AND MAKO.

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,986
IT TURNS OUT THEY REALLY
MISSED THE LITTLE GUY.

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,721
WITH THE MILITARY
BACK IN ACTION,

10
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,689
THE GANG KNEW
THEY HAD TO HELP OUT.

11
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,524
BUT THE D-REAPER
WAS TOO STRONG.

12
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,693
THEN, OUT OF NOWHERE,
BEELZEMON SHOWED UP

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,195
AND SAVED THE DAY.

14
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,530
WHO KNOWS? MAYBE THERE'S
SOME GOOD IN HIM AFTER ALL.

GOOD EVENING.
THIS IS THE NEWS AT 11:00.

39
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,067
TOPPING OUR NEWS TONIGHT,
WE HAVE A SPECIAL REPORT

40
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,302
ON THE ALARMING
AND DANGEROUS SITUATION

41
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,071
DEVELOPING IN WEST SHINJUKU.

42
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,074
A MYSTERIOUS RED SUBSTANCE
WHICH APPEARED A FEW DAYS AGO

43
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,176
IS THREATENING TO CONSUME
THE ENTIRE CITY,

44
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,011
DESPITE THE MILITARY'S
BEST EFFORTS.

45
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,780
TAKING YOU LIVE
TO THE DISASTER ZONE

46
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,650
IS OUR INTREPID REPORTER
MISS ZAKI.

47
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,185
I'M AT THE SHINJUKU
TRAIN STATION,

48
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,987
WHERE THE RED MASS
IS GROWING QUICKLY.

49
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,089
IT'S ALREADY COVERED
HALF THE TRACKS HERE,

50
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,757
AND SHOWS NO SIGNS
OF STOPPING.

51
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,892
AS YOU CAN SEE, THE ARMY
IS MAINTAINING A PRESENCE

52
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,661
IN THE AREA,
DESPITE THE FACT

53
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,262
THEY WERE UNABLE
TO CONTAIN THE MASS.

54
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:12,265
ONE THING YOU MIGHT NOT REALIZE
IS HOW HOT IT IS HERE.

55
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,801
IT SEEMS THE HEAT IS GENERATED
BY THE RED BLOB ITSELF.

56
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,069
LET ME TELL YOU, UNDER MY COAT,

57
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,638
I'M SWEATING
LIKE A PIG ON A SPIT.

58
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,674
EVERY TIME I WAKE UP
IN SCHOOL,

59
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,642
I THINK I'M IN A NIGHTMARE.

60
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,611
[ YAWNING ]

61
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,480
WHAT'S UP?

62
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,816
I COULDN'T GET ANY SLEEP
LAST NIGHT.

63
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,119
AND IT'S NOT 'CAUSE GUILMON
SNORED LIKE A DUMP TRUCK.

64
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,487
SOMETHING BUGGING YOU?

65
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,621
MMM...

66
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,655
I SAW JERI YESTERDAY.

67
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,691
WHAT? WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

68
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,560
WELL, I CALLED HER MOM
IN MATSUMOTO TO TELL HER,

69
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,063
BUT SHE SAID JERI WASN'T GONE
TILL THE EVENING.
SO?

70
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,798
SO I SAW JERI
IN THE EVENING,

71
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,867
BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE,
'CAUSE IT TAKES HOURS

72
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,568
TO GET FROM MATSUMOTO
TO HERE.

73
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:49,903
IT JUST DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

74
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,872
YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT
SEEING THINGS?

75
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,041
WHO KNOWS? MAYBE YOUR GOGGLES
WERE ON TOO TIGHT.

76
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,342
HUH?

77
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,044
THAT'S FUNNY.

78
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,212
I DON'T REMEMBER
LEAVING THE WINDOW OPEN.

79
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,785
IT WAS JERI,
OR JERI'S GHOST.

80
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:05,852
HUH?
HUH?

81
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,154
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY.

82
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,989
I MEAN, SHE COULDN'T
GET HERE THAT FAST

83
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,824
IF SHE HITCHED A RIDE
ON A JET PLANE.

84
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,993
AND THE WAY THAT SHE LOOKED --
I DON'T KNOW.

85
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,796
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
THAT GIVES ME THE WILLIES.

86
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:16,997
OH, PLEASE.

87
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,299
YOU GET THE WILLIES
WHEN YOU LOSE A SOCK.

88
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,734
I JUST HOPE JERI'S OKAY.

89
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,637
SHE'S BEEN FREAKY
EVER SINCE WE GOT HOME.

90
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,572
SHE HAS BEEN THROUGH
A LOT.

91
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,908
I KNOW,
BUT SHE'S NOT JUST UPSET.

92
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,209
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

93
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:33,380
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING'S BROKEN
DEEP INSIDE.

94
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,353
IT'S MY BELIEF

95
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,556
THE RED MASS CAME THROUGH
A NETWORK SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM

96
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,558
CALLED HYPNOS,
A GOVERNMENT OPERATION

97
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,560
THAT MONITORS
THE ON-LINE ACTIVITIES

98
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,395
OF HALF THE GLOBE.

99
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,897
BUT A SYSTEM THAT LARGE CAN ALSO
CAUSE VERY SERIOUS DAMAGE.

100
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,799
PROFESSOR HORATO,
DIDN'T HYPNOS

101
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,801
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE GIANT PIG

102
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:57,104
THAT APPEARED IN WEST SHINJUKU
A FEW MONTHS AGO?

103
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,772
I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED
A DIGIMON.

104
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:02,242
AH, YOU MEAN THAT MONSTER
THAT TORE UP HALF THE CITY.

105
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,377
WELL, OF COURSE.
THAT KING KONG-SIZED PIG

106
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,680
AND THE RED GOOP
AREN'T NATURAL OCCURRENCES.

107
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,215
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY
DATA PROGRAMS

108
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,751
THAT HAVE FOUND A WAY
TO APPEAR IN THE REAL WORLD.

109
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,053
AND THE FOLKS AT HYPNOS
ARE THE ONES RESPONSIBLE.

110
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,423
DO YOU BELIEVE THERE'S
ANY WAY OUT OF THIS CRISIS?

111
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,792
AT THIS POINT, IT WILL TAKE
A MIRACLE.

112
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,027
THANK YOU, PROFESSOR HORATO.

113
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,729
WAIT! THIS JUST IN!

114
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,066
WE'VE RECEIVED EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE
FROM INSIDE THE RED MASS,

115
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:29,836
AND -- OH, YUCK!

116
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,173
HEY, WHAT'S THIS?

117
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,579
HUH?

118
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,614
OUR PARENTS.

119
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,782
THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

120
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,785
THERE ARE NOW REPORTS
OF STRANGE BEINGS

121
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,153
IN ADDITION
TO THE RED MASS.

122
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,921
ARE THEY FLESH, FOWL,

123
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,624
OR ARE THEY MORE DESTRUCTIVE,
VICIOUS DIGIMON?

124
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,792
TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION,
WE HAVE WITH US

125
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,695
PROFESSOR ROB McCOY, A MEMBER
OF THE ORIGINAL TEAM

126
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,097
THAT CREATED THESE DIGIMON.

127
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,598
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

128
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,534
FIRST, I'D LIKE TO CLEAR
ANY MISCONCEPTIONS

129
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,801
PEOPLE HAVE OF DIGIMON.

130
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,603
THESE ARE ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMS,

131
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,438
NOT MONSTERS.

132
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,541
WELL, I MEAN, THEY ARE MONSTERS.
DIGITAL MONSTERS, TO BE EXACT.

133
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,776
THEY'RE JUST NOT ALL
DESTRUCTIVE WRECKING MACHINES

134
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,611
LIKE THE GIANT PIG.
HA HA HA HA.

135
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:12,946
THE DIGIMON'S ABILITY TO EVOLVE

136
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,248
COMES FROM THEIR RELATIONSHIP
WITH CHILDREN --

137
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:16,650
WHICH MAKES SENSE, OF COURSE,

138
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,919
BECAUSE CHILDREN'S MINDS
ARE RICH IN IMAGINATION.

139
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,921
DIGIMON FEED OFF
THIS CREATIVITY

140
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,156
TO BECOME SMARTER
AND STRONGER.

141
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,959
SO IT'S UNLIKELY DIGIMON
WOULD WANT TO HARM OUR WORLD.

142
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,861
THE RED MASS
AND BEINGS AROUND IT

143
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,363
ARE ACTUALLY PART OF
AN OLD CLEAN-UP PROGRAM

144
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:33,133
CALLED D-REAPER, WHICH SOMEHOW
ALSO MANAGED TO EVOLVE.

145
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,169
GUYS, HOLD ON A MINUTE.
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GO.

146
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,704
WHY NOT?

147
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:40,674
WHY NOT? WHAT IF IT'S
A TRAP OR SOMETHING?

148
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,843
RIKA,
MY FOLKS AREN'T LIKE THAT.

149
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,011
MAYBE THEY JUST WANT
TO TALK.

150
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,314
YOU KNOW, RIKA,
HE MAY BE RIGHT.

151
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,715
WE SHOULD TRUST THEM.

152
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,016
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

153
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,220
YOU GUYS ARE SO NAIVE!

154
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,821
HUH? UH...

155
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,723
IS THAT...

156
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,058
JERI!

157
