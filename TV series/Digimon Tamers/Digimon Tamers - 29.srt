1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:04,004
RIKA AND THE GUYS WAITED BY THE
FLAG FOR THE OTHERS TO SHOW UP,

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,706
BUT THEY ALL GOT SUCKED P
BY A DATA STREAM

3
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,708
AND LANDED IN A WORLD FULL OF
CLOCK PARTS.

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,310
MEGADRAMON APPEARED AND TRIED
TO TAKE ON KYUBIMON,

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,046
AND HE MIGHT HAVE BEATEN HER IF
CYBERDRAMON HADN'T COME ALONG.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,315
TURNS OUT HIS PARTNER
IS THE FAMOUS RYO AKIYAM.

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,284
HE AND RIKA DIDN'T HIT IT OFF
VERY WELL,

8
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:20,153
SO SHE AND KYUBIMON LEFT TE
GUYS TO GO OFF ON THEIR OW.

9
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,623
MEANWHILE, TAKATO AND THE
OTHERS FOUND THIS WEIRD CUBE.

10
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:25,025
WHEN THEY GOT INSIDE,
IT SHRANK INTO NOTHING

11
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,094
AND SENT THEM ON THIS WACKY

TO ANOTHER PART
OF THE DIGITAL WORLD.

51
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,150
NOT CHOCOLATE.

52
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,118
LET ME SEE.

00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:04,358
YOU SHOULDN'T EAT EVERYTHING YOU
SEE, ESPECIALLY AROUND HERE.

SEEM TO BE.

I COULD TRY, BUT WHEN I SEE
FOOD, MY BRAIN SHUTS OFF.

I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
I'VE FINALLY BECOME GUILMON.

MAYBE IT'S RIKA
AND THE BOYS!

I SEE THE BOYS, BUT THAT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE RIKA.

HEY, HEY, HEY!
WE HAVE RETURNED!

IT'S ABOUT TIME!

00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,215
YOU HAD US WORRIED!

65
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,150

SOME TROUBLE --

NOTHING I COULDN'T
TAKE CARE OF.

THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS THE
LEGENDARY TAMER RYO.

HE ROCKS!

IF TAMERS WERE CARS,
HE'D BE THE MONSTER TRUCK.

71
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,133
COME ON. I WISH YOU GUYS
WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

WOW! I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S REALLY YOU!

HUH?

00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,105
DON'T TELL ME THAT'S YOUR
PARTNER.

00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,241
YEAH.
THAT IS CYBERDRAMON.

76
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,375
AWESOME!

77
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,377

OH, MAN.

80
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,650
I DON'T THINK HE LIKES ME
VERY MUCH.

81
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,986
[ LAUGHS ]
DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

82
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,421
HE'S NOT THE SOCIALIZING KIND.

83
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:10,590
HE'S REALLY A PUPPY ON THE
INSIDE ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HIM.

84
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,325
PLAY NICE, BOY.

85
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,262

I'LL BELIEVE IT WHEN I SEE IT.

86
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,430
WHO'S RYO?

87
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,131
THE FAMOUS TAMER
WHO DISAPPEARED

88
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,200
AFTER WINNING A MAJOR DIGIMON
TOURNAMENT.

89
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,235
SOME THINK HE'S THE GREATEST
TAMER OF ALL TIME.

90
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,138
HE MUST BE TO KEEP
CYBER-SCARYMON UNDER CONTROL.

91
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,074
THAT DIGIMON LOOKS MEANER
THAN RIKA.

92
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,408
TRY NOT TO PROVOKE HIM.

93
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,709
WHAT? ME? NEVER.

94
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:32,045
KENTA, HOW COME RIKA'S
NOT WITH YOU GUYS?

95
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,047
SHE GOT ALL MAD
AND JUST TOOK OFF.

96
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,382
SHE WENT OFF ON HER OWN?

97
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,050
YEAH.

98
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:40,220
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT
UNLESS ONE OF YOU SAID SOMETHING

99
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,655
TO MAKE HER REALLY MAD.

100
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,690
WHATCHA LOOKING
AT ME FOR?

101
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,194
ACTUALLY, I THINK ALL OF THIS
IS MY FAULT.

102
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,063
HEY, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
IT'S HER -- RIKA. SHE'S NUTS.

103
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,032
KENTA, TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

104
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,601
KAZU KEPT SAYING RYO'S
A BETTER TAMER THAN SHE IS

105
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,703
AND THE ONLY REASON SHE'S
DIGIMON QUEEN

106
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,539
IS 'CAUSE RYO WASN'T AROUND TO
KICK HER BUTT ANYMORE.

107
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,974
WAY TO GO, KAZU.

108
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,076
SHE'S GONNA BE MAD
TILL THE NEXT MILLENNIUM.

109
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,544
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

110
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,614
IT'S DANGEROUS OUT THERE.
SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN TO HER.

111
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,550
BUT RIKA'S SO STRONG, AND SHE
HAS RENAMON WITH HER.

112
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,052
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE FINE.

113

JERI'S RIGHT...I HOPE.

114
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,763
RIKA, WE'VE BEEN WALKING
FOR HOURS.

115
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,432
HOW OBSERVANT, RENAMON.
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

116
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,501
WELL, THERE'S NO SIGN OF
AN EXIT,

117
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,770
AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE
WE'RE GOING.

118
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:34,007
NOT THAT I'M NOT HAPPY TO DRAG
MY TAIL IN THE SAND ALL DAY,

119
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,743
BUT DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD
HAVE GONE WITH RYO?

120
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,378
OH, PLEASE.

121
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,680
THAT HACK COULDN'T TAME HIS WAY
OUT OF A WET PAPER BAG.

122
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,682
JUST A SUGGESTION.

123
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,617
HEY, RYO,
HOW ABOUT SOME POINTERS

124
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,019
ON BEING A BODACIOUS TAMER?

125
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,121
WHERE'D YOU GET
YOUR RADICAL OUTFIT?

126
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,822
WHERE'D YOU GET
CYBERDRAMON?

127
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,791
YEAH!
DOES HE HAVE A TWIN BROTHER?

128
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,093
MAYBE WE SHOULD ASK RYO
ABOUT OUR MISSION.

129
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,029
FINALLY A REASONABLE
SUGGESTION.

130
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,931
THAT'S RIGHT.
I FORGOT TO ASK --

131
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,033
WHY ARE YOU GUYS
IN THE DIGITAL WORLD?

132
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,434
OH, YEAH.

133
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,503
OUR FRIEND CALUMON WAS
KIDNAPPED,

134
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,837
AND WE'RE HERE TO RESCUE HIM.

135
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,906
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM AROUND,
HAVE YOU?

136
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,008
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE?

137
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,343
MAYBE THIS WILL HELP.

138
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,845
HE'S A LITTLE GUY
WHO DOESN'T LIKE TO FIGHT.

139
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,847
A DIGIMON THAT DOESN'T LIKE
TO FIGHT?

140
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,749
THERE'S A FIRST TIME
FOR EVERYTHING.

141
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,018
HE'D RATHER EAT HIS WEIGHT
IN CREAM PUFFS,

142
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,553
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HIM

143
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,455
THAT HELPS OTHER DIGIMON
DIGIVOLVE.

144
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,791
WHO DO YOU THINK MIGHT HAVE
KIDNAPPED HIM?

145
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,359
THE DEVAS.

146
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,495
WE'VE GOT TO FIND HIM BEFORE
ANYTHING BAD HAPPENS.

147
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,763
THE DEVAS?

148
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,098
HERE'S ONE OF THEM.

149
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,901
THEY SERVE SOMEONE CALLED
THE DIGIMON SOVEREIGN.

150
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,503
THIS ONE, MAKURAMON,
WAS THE DIGINAPPER.

151
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,073
WE TRIED TO STOP HIM,
BUT THAT MONKEY WAS TOO QUICK.

152
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,709
BEFORE WE KNEW IT, HE ESCAPED TO
THE DIGITAL WORLD.

153
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,811
THOSE DEVAS ARE TOTALLY
OUT OF CONTROL!

154
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,880
YOU SHOULD SEE THE DESTRUCTION
THEY CAUSED BACK HOME.

155
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,550
I WAS MORE TERRIFIED
THAN I'VE EVER BEEN.

156
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,786
THAT PIG DEVA WAS LIKE A GIANT
BACKHOE -- WELL, WITH A SNOUT.

157
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,421
WE FINALLY STOPPED IT,

UNBELIEVABLE.

490
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,377
NO DIGIMON COULD GO THROUGH
SUCH A DRASTIC CHANGE

AND STILL FIGHT SO FLAWLESSLY.

FOR THAT PUPPY.

UM, RYO, IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH HIM?

502
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:36,741
HE WANTS TO CONTINUE
FIGHTING,

503
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:39,710
SO HE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO FIND
ANOTHER OPPONENT.

HUNGERS FOR.

HE WON'T STOP UNTIL HE'S
COMPLETELY SATISFIED,

510
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:54,892
AND I HAVE TO GO WITH HIM.

BUT I CAN'T CONTROL CYBERDRAMON
WHEN HE GETS LIKE THIS.

00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:05,336
GOOD LUCK DEFEATING THE DEVAS
AND SAVING THE WORLD.
