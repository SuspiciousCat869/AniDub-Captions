HOW DOES IT WORK?

474
00:16:39,663 --> 00:16:42,599

FORGOT ABOUT DIGIMON

475
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:43,800
WHEN THE PROJECT ENDED.

476
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:45,936
BUT I WANTED TO COMPLETE
OUR WORK,

477
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:47,537
SO I CREATED AN ALGORITHM

THAT WOULD ALLOW DIGIMON
TO EVOLVE ON THEIR OWN,

BEYOND WHAT WE HUMANS
COULD IMAGINE FOR THEM.

480
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:53,744
I ORIGINALLY WROTE
THE ALGORITHM

481
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:56,580
TO PROVE THAT DIGIMON
WERE MORE THAN JUST TOYS,

482
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:59,549
THAT THEY WERE A TRUE LIFE-FORM
THAT COULD GROW ON THEIR OWN.

483
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:02,652
BUT I GATHER THAT THE BLUE CARDS
HAVE A DIFFERENT MEANING

484
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:03,754
FOR THE TWO OF YOU.

485
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:06,323
SO, HOW DO YOU GUYS USE
THE ALGORITHM I WROTE?

486
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:08,291
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE ALGORITHM PART,

487
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:11,561
BUT WE USE THE BLUE CARDS
TO BECOME DIGIMON TAMERS.

488
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:12,629
HMM, THAT MAKES SENSE.

489
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:15,699
I'M GLADYOUTHINK SO.

490
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:17,567
THE DIGITAL WORLD IS ALL
ABOUT COMMUNICATION,

491
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:20,237
AND ALL COMMUNICATION IS ABOUT
BRINGING THINGS IN TOUCH.

492
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,607
IT SEEMS THE BLUE-CARD ALGORITHM
IS BEING USED FOR A PURPOSE

493
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:25,442
I DIDN'T QUITE INTEND --

494
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:28,578
TO BRING DIGIMON AND PEOPLE
TOGETHER AS PARTNERS.

495
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:29,579
HUH?

496
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:30,714
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

497
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,085
OH!

498
00:17:35,152 --> 00:17:37,687
HEY, THAT'S MY DRAWING
OF GUILMON!

499
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:39,956
IT SEEMS THE DIGIGNOMES USED
PACKETS OF DATA

500
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,192
TO CREATE HIM
WHEN YOU DREAMED HIM UP --

501
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:44,494
PROBABLY AN ATTEMPT
TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU.

502
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:47,798
OR MAYBE GUILMON DREAMED
HIS DATA INTO EXISTENCE,

503
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:50,200
AND YOU SIMPLY BECAME
AWARE OF HIM.

504
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:53,170
DOES THAT MEAN THAT I WAS
CREATED ESPECIALLY FOR HENRY?

505
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:54,304
PERHAPS.

506
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:56,006
YEAH, CREATED ESPECIALLY
TO ANNOY ME.

507
00:17:56,072 --> 00:17:57,107
HEY!

508
00:17:57,107 --> 00:17:58,508
WELL, AM I WRONG?

509
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:00,076
ADMIT IT, HENRY,
YOU'D BE LOST WITHOUT ME.

510
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,045
LOOKS LIKE I'M LOST
WYOU, TOO.

511
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:04,080
OR MAYBE HENRY
WAS CREATED FOR YOU.

512
00:18:04,114 --> 00:18:06,349
AND GUILMON IS DATA.

513
00:18:06,383 --> 00:18:08,919
SO, DO YOU KNOW OF A WAY
TO GET OUT OF HERE

514
00:18:08,985 --> 00:18:10,754
AND BACK
TO THE REAL WORLD?

515
00:18:10,821 --> 00:18:12,322
YES, THE HIGHEST PLANE.

516
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:14,324
SO, WE'VE GOT TO
KEEP GOING UP?

517
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:16,293
HOW MANY LEVELS ARE
THERE TO THIS PLACE?

518
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:18,795
THERE IS ONLY ONE MORE LEVEL
ABOVE THIS ONE,

519
00:18:18,829 --> 00:18:20,163
AND IT IS THE LEVEL

520
00:18:20,197 --> 00:18:22,699
WHICH THE FOUR MOST POWERFUL
AND MOST EVOLVED DIGIMON

521
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:23,667
HAVE MADE THEIR HOME.

522
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,502
OH, GREAT.

523
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:28,205
THE MOST POWERFUL DIGIMON?
YOU MEAN, THE SOVEREIGN?

524
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:30,807
WAIT A MINUTE?
THERE'S FOUR OF THEM?

525
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,609
IF THEY'RE LIKE GAZULAMON
FROM THE TV SHOW,

526
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:34,010
THEY MUST BE HUGE!

527
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:35,779
DO THEY PROTECT
THE DIGITAL WORLD?

528
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:38,315
IT IS RATHER IRONIC,
DON'T YOU THINK?

529
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:40,050
THE DIGIMON HAVE TRIED
TO EVOLVE

530
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,618
INTO LARGER AND
STRONGER FORMS

531
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:44,387
TO SET THEMSELVES APART FROM
THE HUMANS WHO CREATED THEM.

532
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:46,756
THEY'VE ENDED UP TAKING
ON THE FORMS OF ANCIENT GODS

533
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,191
OF THE HUMANS.

534
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:51,795
DIGIMON AND HUMANS WILL NEVER
BE ABLE TO SEPARATE THEMSELVES.

535
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:53,797
THEY LIVE IN THE
SAME WORLD, REALLY.

536
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:55,866
AND IT'S ONLY WHEN
THAT'S RECOGNIZED

537
00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:57,834
THAT THE NEXT EVOLUTION
WILL BEGIN.

538
00:18:57,834 --> 00:19:00,203
IF THEY PROTECT THIS PLACE,
THEN THEY'RE GOOD, RIGHT?

539
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,605
THAT'S NOT WHAT
SENSEI SAYS.

540
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:04,140
HE SAYS THAT GOOD AND EVIL
CAN SWITCH DEFINITIONS,

541
00:19:04,174 --> 00:19:06,109
DEPENDING ON
YOUR PERSPECTIVE.

542
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:08,845
LET'S JUST HOPE OUR PERSPECTIVE
IS THE RIGHT ONE.

543
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:09,913
OH.

544
00:19:14,438 --> 00:19:16,139
THE SOVEREIGN SEEM TO WANT

545
00:19:16,173 --> 00:19:18,575
TO ACCELERATE DIGIVOLUTION
TO RESIST SOMETHING.

546
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:20,344
IT SEEMS THEY'RE AFRAID
THEY WON'T SURVIVE

547
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:23,313
UNLESS THEY FIND A WAY TO DEFEAT
WHATEVER IS COMING FOR THEM.

548
00:19:23,347 --> 00:19:24,948
I WONDER WHAT
THEY'RE AFRAID OF.

549
00:19:24,982 --> 00:19:27,751
YEAH, WHAT COULD DEFEAT
THE SOVEREIGN?

550
00:19:27,784 --> 00:19:29,987
COULD IT BE SOMEONE
LIKE YAMAKI USED TO BE?

551
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:31,288
OR MAYBE IT COULD BE US!

552
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:33,256
MAYBE IT'S ME.

553
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,257
[ LAUGHS ]

554
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,393
OKAY.

555
00:19:36,393 --> 00:19:38,261
HUH?

556
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:40,230
THAT IS ALL
I CAN TELL YOU NOW.

557
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,433
THE REST, YOU MUST LEARN
ON YOUR OWN, I'M AFRAID.

558
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,601
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?

559
00:19:46,822 --> 00:19:50,098
I'M VERY TIRED.
I MUST SLEEP NOW.

560
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:54,436
AH, TO SLEEP,
PERCHANCE TO DREAM.

561
00:19:54,436 --> 00:19:56,312
MAN, THAT GUY HAD
A LOT OF INFORMATION,

562
00:19:56,312 --> 00:19:58,729
BUT I THINK I'M MORE CONFUSED
NOW THAN I WAS BEFORE.

563
00:19:58,729 --> 00:20:00,631
HMM, IS THAT POSSIBLE?

564
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:03,500
MAYBE THE DIGIGNOMES
CAN ERASE DIGIMON, TOO.

565
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,407
TAKATO, YOU SEEM QUIET
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

566
00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:13,611
SORRY, I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT GUILMON,

567
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:16,480
AND IF WHAT THAT GUY TOLD US
WAS REALLY TRUE.

568
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:20,584
THEN, IF GUILMON IS A PART OF ME
AND HE'S DATA, AM I DATA?

569
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:23,020
HMM. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH DATA?

570
00:20:23,053 --> 00:20:24,421
ALL DIGIMON
ARE LIKE THAT.

571
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:28,025
I GUESS.
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S WEIRD.

572
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:29,593
I CAN HANDLE BEING DATA,

573
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:32,263
BUT IF I LOSE GUILMON, I'LL LOSE
A PART OF MYSELF FOREVER.

574
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:34,565
I GUESS SOME ANSWERS
ARE MORE CONFUSING

575
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:36,367
THAN THE QUESTIONS.

576
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,636
SEE IF THEY'LL FIGURE IT OT
ON THE NEXT "DIGIMON" --

577
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:39,737
"DIGITAL MONSTERS."

578
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:47,311
DIGIMON, DIGIMON

579
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:51,348
DI, DI, DIGIMON, DIGIMON

580
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:53,484
DI, DI, DI

581
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:53,484
DI, DI

582
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:55,486
DI, DI
