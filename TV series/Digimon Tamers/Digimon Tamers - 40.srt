WORK OUT THE WAY WE PLAN?

319
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:29,292
YEAH, AND IT'S ALMOST TIME
FOR NIGHTFALL.

320
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:30,893
THAT'LL MAKE IT
DIFFICULT.

321
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,662
WILL MAKE WHAT DIFFICULT?

322
00:14:32,695 --> 00:14:35,247
RENAMON, WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU SEEM REALLY DISTRACTED.

323
00:14:35,247 --> 00:14:37,282
I FEEL HIS PRESENCE.

324
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,340
HE'S...ALIVE?

325
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,257
I THINK SO.

326
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:46,051
RIKA, WILL YOU GO WITH ME
TO FIND HIM?

327
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:46,901
OF COURSE.

328
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:48,136
WE'RE LEAVING.

329
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:49,938
RIKA AND I HAVE SOMETHING
WE MUST DO.

330
00:14:49,938 --> 00:14:51,406
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

331
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:52,941
NO WAY.
THAT'S CRAZY TALK.

332
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:54,275
HEY, HAVE YOU GUYS
GONE 'ROUND THE BEND?

333
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:55,944
WE'RE GOING HOME!

334
00:14:55,944 --> 00:14:58,413
I KNOW, BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT,
AND WE'LL BE BACK IN TIME.

335
00:14:58,446 --> 00:15:00,582
HOW IMPORTANT CAN IT BE?
OKAY.

336
00:15:00,582 --> 00:15:03,918
IT'S NOT OKAY, BUT I BET
YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT ANYWAY.

337
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:06,254
MM-HMM. WE'LL BE BACK
BY NIGHTFALL.

338
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:09,090
I BETTER CARRY YOU, THEN.

339
00:15:09,123 --> 00:15:12,093
I THINK I HAVE SOME IDEA
WHERE HE IS.

340
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:13,428
WE'LL NEVER
SEE THEM AGAIN.

341
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:15,096
OF COURSE WE WILL.

342
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,564
SHE JUST HAS TO
DO THINGS HER WAY.

343
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:18,558
ONCE SHE GETS AN IDEA
IN HER HEAD,

344
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:19,892
THERE'S NO STOPPING HER.

345
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:23,714
LIKE YOU, DAD.

346
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:34,858
UNACCEPTABLE.

347
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:37,360
I CANNOT BELIEVE
THIS IS THE END OF IT,

348
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,697
BUT HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY
DO THE NECESSARY CALCULATIONS

349
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:42,899
WITHOUT THE HYPNOS SYSTEM?

350
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:43,667
MOMENTIE.

351
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,668
HMM?

352
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:46,870
MOMENTIE.
I HAVE AN IDEA.

353
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,880
[ Thinking ] I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE DOING THIS.

354
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,117
YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU ACTUALLY
HEARD IMPMON CALL OUT?

355
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,386
YES. THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN
A CONNECTION BETWEEN US.

356
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,056
THEN, WHEN WE BECAME SAKUYAMON,
I FELT --

357
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:06,990
WHAT?

358
00:16:07,057 --> 00:16:10,293
I FELT A DEEP
PROTECTIVE FEELING,

359
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,895
NOT JUST FOR THOSE I LIKE,

360
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:14,865
BUT COMPASSION
FOR ALL LIVING CREATURES.

361
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:16,199
DID YOU FEEL IT, TOO, RIKA?

362
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:19,903
I DID, BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT,
IT'S A LITTLE OVERWHELMING.

363
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:23,407
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE
WHO NEED OUR HELP.

364
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,075
WE'LL START WITH IMPMON

365
00:16:25,142 --> 00:16:29,045
BECAUSE EVERY WAVE BEGINS
WITH A DROP OF WATER.

366
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:33,450
YEAH, BUT WAVES
DON'T TALK BACK.

367
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:35,886
THEY ALSO DON'T MAKE
GOOD FRIENDS.

368
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:38,955
IF HE GETS TOO MOUTHY,
I'LL GAG HIM WITH HIS BANDANA.

369
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:39,790
LET'S GO.

370
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:45,595
JUST HOLD ON, KIDS.

371
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:49,132
WE'LL FIND A WAY
TO GET TO YOU...I PROMISE.

372
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,567
I'M GETTING
SOME STRANGE READINGS.

373
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,735
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

374
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:53,570
WE'RE INTEGRATING
THE PROCESSING POWER

375
00:16:53,603 --> 00:16:55,772
OF THE COMPUTERS OF PEOPLE
ALL OVER THE WORLD --

376
00:16:55,772 --> 00:16:56,973
FRIENDS, COLLEAGUES,
TOTAL STRANGERS.

377
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:58,942
WE'RE NOT PROUD.

378
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:01,378
THOUSANDS OF SMALLER COMPUTERS
MAKE UP ONE SUPER-COMPUTER.

379
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:02,546
HAS IT BEEN DONE BEFORE?

380
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:05,081
IT HAS, BUT NOT FOR SUCH
A TIME-CRUCIAL PROBLEM.

381
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:07,184
MEDICAL RESEARCHERS
WERE THE FIRST TO TRY IT,

382
00:17:07,217 --> 00:17:08,885
BUT THEN AGAIN,

383
00:17:08,952 --> 00:17:11,288
NO ONE EXPECTS THEM
TO CURE CANCER IN 15 MINUTES.

384
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,091
HUH?

385
00:17:16,091 --> 00:17:17,825
IS THIS A JOKE?

386
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:19,995
"PLEASE HELP US SAVE
A LARGE GROUP OF CHILDREN."

387
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:21,830
SURE DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A JOKE!

388
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,934
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ON THE COMPUTER?

389
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:42,769
RIKA NEEDS US!

390
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:45,814
YES, AND WE'LL BE THERE
FOR HER.

391
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:49,118
YOU ARE ALWAYS
SO DRAMATIC, DEAR.

392
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,387
[ Thinking ] RIKA, NO!

393
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:53,822
I MAY NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN!

394
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:58,794
AH...IT'S WORKING!

395
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:06,792
IT'S AMAZING.

396
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:08,961
WE'RE GETTING POWER
FROM ALL OVER THE PLANET.

397
00:18:08,994 --> 00:18:10,629
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,
THIS IS IT.

398
00:18:10,663 --> 00:18:12,865
YOU SHOULD HAVE ALL THE JUICE
YOU NEED BY NOW.

399
00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:15,100
IT'S TIME TO FLY, MY FRIENDS.
LET'S DO IT.

400
00:18:15,134 --> 00:18:18,203
[ Thinking ] I NEVER KNEW PEOPLE
COULD WORK TOGETHER

401
00:18:18,237 --> 00:18:19,872
SO QUICKLY AND FLAWLESSLY.

402
00:18:19,905 --> 00:18:21,907
A PERFECT TEAM,
THESE MONSTER-MAKERS.

403
00:18:29,715 --> 00:18:31,684
THE TRACK
SHOULD BE HERE BY NOW.

404
00:18:31,717 --> 00:18:32,851
BUT WHERE?

405
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:33,919
THERE, TAKATO. LOOK!

406
00:18:36,522 --> 00:18:37,723
RIKA AND RENAMON,
WHERE ARE YOU?

407
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:41,860
THEY'LL BE BACK.

408
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,295
MAYBE WE CAN DELAY THE ARK
WHEN IT GETS HERE.

409
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:50,502
IMPMON?

410
00:18:50,536 --> 00:18:51,370
IMPMON!

411
00:18:51,437 --> 00:18:52,371
IMPMON!

412
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:54,940
RENAMON?

413
00:18:54,974 --> 00:18:56,275
IMPMON, CAN YOU STAND?

414
00:18:56,308 --> 00:18:58,010
HMPH!
OF COURSE I CAN!

415
00:18:58,077 --> 00:19:00,212
WE WANT YOU
TO COME HOME WITH US.

416
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:03,148
YOU OUT OF YOUR
TEENY, TINY MINDS?

417
00:19:03,182 --> 00:19:05,017
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE!

418
00:19:08,554 --> 00:19:11,523
WELL, MAYBE IF YOU ASKED ME
REAL NICE...

419
00:19:11,557 --> 00:19:13,692
YOU'RE NOT JUST
PLAYING A JOKE?

420
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:16,528
IF SO, THE JOKE'S ON US.
COME ON.

421
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:25,371
THIS IS THE POINT
OF NO RETURN.

422
00:19:29,908 --> 00:19:31,744
LOOKS THAT WAY.

423
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:36,749
THERE'S THE ARK!
IT'S ALMOST HERE!

424
00:19:44,514 --> 00:19:45,472
[ DIGIVICE BEEPS ]

425
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:47,394
HURRY AND GET ON.
YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

426
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,730
OH, MAN, YOU GUYS,
WE BETTER MOVE IT AHEAD.

427
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:59,039
I SURE HOPE RIKA AND RENAMON
DON'T MISS THE BOAT BACK HOME!

428
00:19:59,106 --> 00:20:00,507
IT'S GOING TO BE A BUMPY RIDE

429
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,243
ON THE NEXT "DIGIMON" --
DIGITAL MONSTERS.
