159
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,173
WHOA!

160
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,742
YOUR FEELINGS OF DESPAIR
ARE PROVIDING THE D-REAPER

161
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,544
ALL THE ENERGY IT NEEDS.

162
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:28,248
NO! STOP!

163
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,450
TAKATO!

164
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,019
HELP ME!

165
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,258
AAH!

166
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,594
AAH!

167
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,432
[ Thinking ] YOU KNOW,
WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE

168
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,467
I'M HURTING IT,
I'M HELPING IT.

169
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,337
WHAT IF I JUST CAUSED
THE WHOLE WORLD TO BE ERASED?

170
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,645
WHAT IS THAT?

171
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,413
I'M GETTING
MASSIVE ENERGY SPIKES!

172
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,216
ITS HEAT OUTPUT
IS UP OVER 200%!

173
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,386
AND I'M NOT READING
THE MAGNETIC PULSES ANYMORE!

174
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,254
FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING
RIGHT NOW!

175
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,467
COME ON, JERI!
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME!

176
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,303
YOU DO REMEMBER WHAT
HELPING IS, DON'T YOU?

177
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,339
THAT'S NOT IT!

178
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,674
NEITHER IS THAT!

179
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,676
THIS IS MY FAULT.

180
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,678
THE WORLD WOULD BE BETTER OFF
WITHOUT ME.

181
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,314
DON'T SAY THAT!

182
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,585
NO! NO! AAH!

183
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,656
JERI, YOU HAVE TO STOP!

184
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,725
THE D-REAPER
WILL KEEP FEEDING ON YOU

185
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,660
UNTIL YOU'RE ALL
DOUBLED UP!

186
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,630
DID I JUST HEAR JERI?

187
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:54,567
JERI! HOLD ON!

188
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:57,570
IT IS TOO LATE FOR YOUR FRIENDS
TO HELP YOU, JERI.

189
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:01,408
I NOW HAVE THE ENERGY
TO EVOLVE EVEN FURTHER!

190
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:05,612
HEH HEH HEH HEH!

191
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,981
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S IT DOING?

192
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,682
I DON'T KNOW!

193
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,952
OH, COME ON!
WHEN DO WE EVER KNOW?

194
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,487
BE READY FOR ANYTHING!

195
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,690
WE'VE GOT TO GET TO JERI
BEFORE IT'S...

196
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,626
TOO LATE. NO!

197
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,827
JERI!

198
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,662
WHAT NOW?

199
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,631
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO FEED IT

200
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,166
IF IT KEEPS CHANGING?

201
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,204
OH, MAN,
THAT THING IS HUGE!

202
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,739
THE MINUTE WE GET USED
TO ONE FORM,

203
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,208
THE D-REAPER BECOMES ANOTHER,
MORE POWERFUL THAN THE LAST.

204
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,177
ARE WE EVER GOING
TO GET A BREAK?

205
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,079
THIS JUST
CAN'T BE HAPPENING!

206
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,714
I'M AFRAID TO FIND OUT
WHAT THAT THING CAN DO!

207
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,383
I BET WE FIND OUT,

208
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,685
WHETHER YOU'RE AFRAID
OR NOT!

209
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,187
LOOK OUT!

210
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,055
[ GASPS ]

211
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,025
OH, GREAT, SOMETHING ELSE
TO FIGURE OUT.

212
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,194
WELL, NO MATTER WHAT IT IS
OR HOW DANGEROUS IT IS,

213
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,729
WE CAN'T GIVE UP ON TRYING
TO SAVE JERI.

214
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:57,897
NOW LET'S GO GET HER!

215
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,132
Guilmon: UM...

216
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,800
WHAT'S WRONG, GUILMON?

217
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,802
EVEN AT MEGA-LEVEL,
IF WE GO IN THERE,

218
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,704
WE'LL LOSE OUR POWER,
REMEMBER?

219
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,607
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE CAN DO, TAKATO.

220
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,577
I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THAT.

221
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,245
IT'S NOT WHAT ANY OF US
WANT, TAKATO,

222
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,913
BUT WE'VE GOT TO PULL BACK
AND FIGURE OUT

223
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,615
A PLAN OF ATTACK.

224
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,785
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO, YOU KNOW,
LOSE ANY MORE OF US.

225
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,622
NO-O-O!

226
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,657
Henry: BELIEVE ME, TAKATO,
I FEEL THE SAME WAY,

227
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,426
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER CHOICE!

228
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,761
THAT THING'S
JUST TOO POWERFUL.

229
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,430
IF WE GO AFTER IT
WITHOUT ANY IDEA

230
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,532
OF WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST,
WE COULD SACRIFICE

231
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,335
THE WORLD'S ONLY CHANCE
OF SURVIVAL -- US!

232
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:43,500
Takato:
I KNOW WE NEED A PLAN,

233
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:45,936
BUT IT SURE FEELS LIKE
WE'RE JUST...GIVING UP.

234
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,205
Babel: RUSHING IN RIGHT NOW
WOULD BE SUICIDE.

235
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,007
DON'T WORRY, TAKATO.

236
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,076
WE'RE WORKING ON A PLAN,
BUT WE NEED TIME

237
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:53,744
TO PUT IT
INTO ACTION.

238
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:55,579
BUT JERI
IS STILL OUT THERE!

239
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,348
I JUST KNOW SHE IS!
WE'VE GOT TO GET IN THERE

240
00:10:57,414 --> 00:11:00,384
AND SAVE HER
BEFORE IT REALLY IS TOO LATE!

241
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:04,521
WE'LL GET TO HER, TAKATO,
AS LONG AS WE STILL CAN.

242
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:07,157
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE THIS
TO US NOW.

243
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:10,060
AT THIS STAGE,
WE JUST DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

244
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,795
OH...

245
00:11:14,865 --> 00:11:17,034
Takato: [ Thinking ]
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A COWARD,

246
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:19,870
BUT I GUESS IT'S OUT
OF MY HANDS NOW.

247
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:21,338
OH...

248
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:25,075
STILL, I JUST HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO GET JERI BACK.

249
00:11:29,947 --> 00:11:31,582
YOU KNOW, GUILMON,

250
00:11:31,582 --> 00:11:33,617
EVEN SOMEPLACE
AS BEAUTIFUL AS THIS

251
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,253
ISN'T VERY RESTFUL
IF YOU'RE ANXIOUS INSIDE.

252
00:11:36,286 --> 00:11:37,554
YEAH...

253
00:11:37,588 --> 00:11:40,124
[ BOTH SIGH ]

254
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,260
Boy: TAKATO! YO, TAKATO!

255
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,832
HEY, TAKATO,
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

256
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:51,168
KAI, WHAT'S UP?
WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

257
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:52,770
JUST NOW.

258
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,072
MAN, THE OCEAN SURE IS
RIGHTEOUS HERE!

259
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:57,808
YEAH, GUILMON AND I WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT HOW...

260
00:11:57,808 --> 00:12:00,611
RIGHTEOUS IT IS.

261
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,748
RIKA, HONEY,
STOP FIDGETING.

262
00:12:04,782 --> 00:12:06,417
YOU'D THINK A FANCY PLACE
LIKE THIS

263
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,452
COULD AFFORD CUSHIONS
FOR THE STUPID SEATS.

264
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:10,888
I HEARD THAT,
YOU KNOW.

265
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:12,056
GOOD.

266
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:13,290
RIKA...
WHAT?

267
00:12:13,323 --> 00:12:14,892
I DON'T THINK I CAN JUST
SIT HERE LIKE THIS.

268
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:17,761
I KNOW, RENAMON, BUT THERE'S
NOTHING WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW.

269
00:12:17,795 --> 00:12:20,931
SO, RENAMON,
YOU'RE A GIRL, RIGHT?

270
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:23,767
ACTUALLY, DIGIMON AREN'T
DIVIDED INTO GENDERS.

271
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:26,103
BUT ONLY A WOMAN COULD WEAR FUR
THAT WELL.

272
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:28,439
EITHER WAY, YOU'RE STILL PART
OF OUR FAMILY.

273
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:30,074
RIKA.
MM-HMM.

274
00:12:30,107 --> 00:12:33,010
I KNOW THIS ISN'T THE WAY
YOU'D LIKE THINGS TO BE,

275
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,245
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
TO SPEND TIME

276
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:37,981
AS A FAMILY RIGHT NOW,
OKAY?

277
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,185
[ Thinking ] BUT I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT JERI.

278
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,821
SO, KAI, HOW COME
YOU'RE HERE, ANYWAY?

279
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:46,123
HEY, I COULDN'T JUST STAY
IN OKINAWA

280
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:48,158
WHEN MY COUSIN WAS DUKING IT
OUT WITH THAT THING.

281
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:51,161
BESIDES, HAVE YOU SEEN
THIS FANTASTIC VIEW? PRIMO.

282
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,162
MM-HMM.

283
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:54,198
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
SURE.

284
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:58,068
YOU GUYS ARE, LIKE, OUT THERE
TO SAVE THE WORLD OR SOMETHING,

285
00:12:58,102 --> 00:12:59,348
HUH?

286
00:12:59,436 --> 00:13:02,172
WELL, I GUESS SO, BUT I REALLY
JUST WANT TO STOP THE D-REAPER

287
00:13:02,206 --> 00:13:04,141
FROM HURTING MORE PEOPLE...

288
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:07,478
PEOPLE LIKE JERI.

289
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:10,147
YOU LIKE HER,
DON'T YOU?
WHAT?

290
00:13:10,147 --> 00:13:12,316
SHE'S YOUR FIRST LOVE,
DUDE.

291
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:14,184
I DON'T --
I MEAN, UH...

292
00:13:14,218 --> 00:13:16,687
GO ON, ADMIT IT!

293
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,655
YEAH, OKAY,
I GUESS I LIKE HER.

294
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:20,157
I MEAN, I DO.

295
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,192
THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE IN SO MUCH PAIN.

296
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,994
SHE'S A PART OF YOU.

297
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:25,829
DOES IT EVER GET
ANY BETTER, KAI?

298
00:13:25,863 --> 00:13:28,665
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN TAKE ALL THIS.

299
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:30,634
WHAT IF SHE REALLY IS GONE?

300
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,904
JERI, YOU'VE GOT TO AT LEAST
TRY TO FEEL BETTER.

301
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:35,906
IF YOU KEEP GETTING DOWN
ON YOURSELF,

302
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:38,575
EVERYTHING'S ONLY GOING
TO GET WORSE.

303
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,211
THIS ISN'T YOUR FAULT, YOU KNOW.
IT'S THE D-REAPER.

304
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:43,480
BUT IT PICKED ME,
DIDN'T IT?

305
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:45,716
YOUR SELF'S
JUST FEELING SORRY.

306
00:13:45,749 --> 00:13:49,186
YOU GOT TO LOOK ON THE BRIGHT
SIDE OF THINGS, JERI.

307
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:51,188
THINK ABOUT ALL THE GOOD STUFF
IN YOUR LIFE,

308
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:53,223
LIKE GREAT FRIENDS LIKE ME.

309
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:55,225
DON'T YOU WANT
TO BE HAPPY AGAIN?

310
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:57,728
DO I DESERVE TO BE,
CALUMON?

311
00:13:57,728 --> 00:14:00,998
WHAT IF ALL MY GREAT FRIENDS
GET ERASED BECAUSE OF ME?

312
00:14:00,998 --> 00:14:03,000
WHAT THEN?

313
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:05,335
AW, JERI, JUST THINK
HOW HAPPY YOU COULD BE

314
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:08,672
IF YOU DIDN'T WORK SO HARD
TO MAKE YOURSELF SO SAD.

315
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:12,309
Woman: WE GOT JOHNNY BACK
ON THE LINE.

316
00:14:12,376 --> 00:14:14,244
SO, WHAT'S THE NEWS,
JOHNNY?

317
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:17,047
IT'S NOT GOOD, DOLPHIN.
THE D-REAPER'S BEGUN EXPANDING

318
00:14:17,047 --> 00:14:18,882
IN OTHER COUNTRIES,
AS WELL.

319
00:14:18,882 --> 00:14:20,851
THE MAGNETIC DISRUPTERS
HAVE BEEN DISRUPTED THEMSELVES,

320
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:23,220
AND OUR SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS
AREN'T GOING TO LAST

321
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:25,222
MUCH LONGER
FROM THE LOOKS OF THINGS.

322
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:26,857
SO, WHAT'S THE BAD NEWS?

323
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,759
ACTUALLY, THERE ISSOME
GOOD NEWS.

324
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:30,761
A SENSOR
INSIDE THE D-REAPER'S FIELD

325
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,396
IS STILL SENDING BACK DATA.

326
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:33,897
REALLY?

327
00:14:33,897 --> 00:14:35,732
EVEN THOUGH MOST
OF THE SENSORS WERE DELETED,

328
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,734
THERE WERE STILL A FEW
THAT REMAINED HIDDEN

329
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:39,469
AMONG THE BUILDINGS.
WE WERE JUST LUCKY

330
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,738
THE D-REAPER HADN'T FOUND THEM
AND TAKEN THEM OUT.

331
00:14:41,738 --> 00:14:44,274
ANYWAY, THE DATA THEY'VE BEEN
SENDING BACK IS PRETTY STRANGE.

332
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:46,310
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
JOHNNY?

333
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,979
AT FIRST, WE THOUGHT THE SENSOR
HAD MALFUNCTIONED.

334
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:51,448
THEN WE REALIZED
THAT THE D-REAPER ZONE

335
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:54,151
IS ESSENTIALLY AN EVENLY
DISTRIBUTED REGION OF ENERGY.

336
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,420
THE WEAK AND STRONG FORCES
ARE IN COMPLETE BALANCE

337
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:59,122
WITH EACH OTHER,
AND THIS IS THE KICKER --

338
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:01,258
THE PARTICLES INSIDE
ARE TRAVELING AT A RATE --

339
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:03,360
WAIT, LET ME GUESS.

340
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:05,596
AT A RATE FASTER
THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT?

341
00:15:05,662 --> 00:15:07,231
IT'S A QUANTUM BUBBLE!

342
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:10,133
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN THE MONSTER
MAKERS WOULD FIGURE IT OUT!

343
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:11,902
WELL, AS FAST
AS THIS THING EVOLVES,

344
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:13,637
IT WAS THE ONLY NATURAL
CONCLUSION.

345
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,739
I THINK THIS MAY BE THE KEY
TO DESTROYING THAT THING.

346
00:15:15,806 --> 00:15:18,141
IF WE COULD MAKE A TINY BIG BANG
WITHIN THE D-REAPER,

347
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:20,477
THE ENSUING BLACK HOLE
WOULD SUCK THAT THING OUT

348
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,878
LIKE A VACUUM CLEANER.

349
00:15:21,945 --> 00:15:23,981
YEAH, EASIER SAID
THAN DONE, MY FRIEND.

350
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:25,949
BUT WHAT THE HECK?
I'M IN THE MOOD

351
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:27,818
FOR A LITTLE SPRING CLEANING.
HOW ABOUT YOU, CURLY?

352
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:29,987
I'M ALREADY WAY AHEAD
OF YOU.

353
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,955
MAN, YOU ARE TOO GOOD.

354
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:33,957
LET'S JUST HOPE THE D-REAPER
IS AS EASILY IMPRESSED

355
00:15:33,957 --> 00:15:35,158
AS YOU.

356
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,327
THIS VORTEX SHOULD REVERT
THE D-REAPER

357
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,162
TO ITS ORIGINAL FORM.

358
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,431
GOOD WORK. BUT WE JUST HAVE
TO BE CAREFUL

359
00:15:41,465 --> 00:15:43,133
THAT IT DOESN'T
DRAWUSIN, TOO.

360
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,868
I GUESS I'LL LEAVE YOU GUYS
TO YOUR WORK.

361
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,436
GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING.

362
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,804
THANKS, JOHNNY.

363
00:15:47,804 --> 00:15:50,307
I KNEW THIS WAS GOING
TO HAPPEN.

364
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:52,442
WATCH OUT
FOR THE MAELSTROM.

365
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:53,710
HEY, WAIT!

366
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,113
AREN'T YOU GOING TO STAY
AND HELP US?

367
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:58,215
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL HELP IN MY OWN WAY.

368
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,284
NOW, DON'T GO DISAPPEARING.
OH, WAIT, THAT'S WHAT I DO.

369
00:16:00,284 --> 00:16:02,152
HA HA HA HA!

370
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:03,487
WHOO!

371
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,488
AAH!

372
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:05,956
IT'S HER FAULT.

373
00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:08,125
EVERYTHING IS
ALL JERI'S FAULT.

374
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:11,094
IF JERI WASN'T AROUND
ANYMORE,

375
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:13,997
NO MORE BAD STUFF
WOULD HAPPEN.

376
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:16,133
NOBODY ELSE WOULD EVER
GET HURT,

377
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:17,367
ESPECIALLY NOT TAKATO.

378
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:20,203
JERI, PLEASE, YOU'VE GOT
TO SNAP OUT OF THIS.

379
00:16:20,237 --> 00:16:23,640
IF YOU DON'T FIGHT BACK,
THE D-REAPER REALLY WILL WIN.

380
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:26,343
THE D-REAPER HAS ALREADY WON,
FOOLISH DIGIMON.

381
00:16:26,343 --> 00:16:29,279
THE BEING CALLED JERI
HAS TAUGHT THE D-REAPER

382
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:32,316
EVERYTHING IT NEEDS TO KNOW
ABOUT HUMANS.

383
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:35,319
NOTHING THEY HAVE
CAN BEAT THE D-REAPER.

384
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:37,854
NOTHING.

385
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:43,894
Janyu:
DON'T WORRY, TERRIERMON,

386
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,562
THIS WILL BE OVER
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

387
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,164
MOMENTIE.

388
00:16:47,197 --> 00:16:49,866
HEY, DAD, WHY ARE YOU
SCANNING TERRIERMON?

389
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:52,102
I NEED TO GET AN IDEA
OF THE COMPOSITIONAL

390
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:54,871
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DIGIMON
AND THE D-REAPER,

391
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:57,774
SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT
HOW TO TARGET IT.

392
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,876
MY HAIR FEELS
REALLY FUNNY.

393
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,279
SORRY. I'LL REDUCE
THE SCANNER'S INTENSITY.

394
00:17:02,346 --> 00:17:03,847
HUH?

395
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,225
D-Reaper: SOON THE NETWORK
WILL BE COMPLETED,

396
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:18,061
AND THE DESTRUCTION
OF THIS WORLD

397
00:17:18,128 --> 00:17:19,996
WILL TRULY BEGIN!

398
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,032
THE D-REAPERS
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD

399
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:23,934
ARE JOINING TOGETHER
TO FORM ONE BEING!

400
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,037
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.
ITS TEMPERATURE'S INCREASING.

401
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:30,040
IT'S SO BIG. IF THAT THING
GETS ANY HOTTER,

402
00:17:30,107 --> 00:17:32,909
IT COULD CHANGE THE TEMPERATURE
OF THE ENTIRE PLANET.

403
00:17:32,943 --> 00:17:35,178
THE POLAR ICE CAPS WOULD MELT
AND FLOOD MOST OF THE EARTH

404
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:36,913
IN A MATTER OF DAYS!

405
00:17:36,913 --> 00:17:38,782
HENRY...

406
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,250
IT'S UP TO US.

407
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,285
IT'S TIME TO GO!

408
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,221
NO!

409
00:17:44,254 --> 00:17:48,125
DON'T LISTEN
TO THAT RAG!

410
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:51,228
DON'T YOU KNOW
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE?

411
00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:54,131
EVERYBODY LOVES TO SEE
YOU SMILING, JERI --

412
00:17:54,197 --> 00:17:57,100
TAKATO, GUILMON,
ESPECIALLY ME.

413
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:59,202
IT'S TRUE.

414
00:18:01,304 --> 00:18:03,907
CALUMON -- AAH!

415
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,409
OH!

416
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:07,744
NO!

417
00:18:07,778 --> 00:18:12,082
NO! CALUMON!

418
00:18:14,151 --> 00:18:17,587
TAKATO, TAKATO!
HELP ME!

419
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:19,256
HELP ME!

420
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:20,924
JERI, NO.

421
00:18:20,924 --> 00:18:22,592
WH-WHAT'S WRONG?

422
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:24,261
TAKATO, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

423
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:26,563
I HEARD JERI.

424
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:28,465
GUILMON, SHE NEEDS US NOW!

425
00:18:28,532 --> 00:18:32,102
THERE'S KAI. WHY DIDN'T YOU WAIT
AT THE TRAIN STATION?

426
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:35,906
HEY, TAKATO, ARE YOU OKAY?
WHAT'S WRONG, BUDDY?

427
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:37,474
HONEY?

428
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:39,309
Man: HENRY?

429
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:40,677
MR. MIZUNO.

430
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,846
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

431
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:46,316
I PUT AN ALGORITHM ON THIS CARD
THAT MAY GIVE YOU AND THE OTHERS

432
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:48,785
THE EDGE YOU NEED
OVER THE D-REAPER.

433
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:51,054
I JUST KNEW
YOU'D COME THROUGH.

434
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,661
HENRY'S CALLING.

435
00:18:57,694 --> 00:18:59,796
IT'S TIME FOR US
TO GO, RENAMON.

436
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:01,598
I KNOW.

437
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:05,569
I'M SORRY, GRANDMA AND MOM.

438
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,504
THAT'S HENRY.

439
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:11,475
SO YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO FIGHT, ARE YOU?

440
00:19:11,508 --> 00:19:13,243
I'M SORRY. I HAVE TO.

441
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,078
THE WHOLE WORLD
IS DEPENDING ON US.

442
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:17,414
IT'S JUST SO DANGEROUS,
SON.

443
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:20,350
Janyu: YOU'RE LEAVING,
HENRY? I...

444
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:22,319
I'M COMING BACK, DAD.

445
00:19:22,352 --> 00:19:24,821
SEE YOU LATER!

446
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:27,791
YEAH...

447
00:19:27,824 --> 00:19:29,493
BE CAREFUL.

448
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:32,195
BIOMERGE, ACTIVATE!

449
00:19:35,198 --> 00:19:38,235
RENAMON, BIOMERGE TO...

450
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:57,387
SAKUYAMON!

451
00:20:01,057 --> 00:20:03,260
AND THIS TIME
THERE'S NO STOPPING US.

452
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:06,229
THERE CAN'T BE.

453
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:14,237
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
I LOVE YOU.

454
00:20:14,304 --> 00:20:18,208
WE WISH YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO FIGHT, BUT WE UNDERSTAND,

455
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:21,144
AND WE'RE PROUD
THAT YOU'RE OUR SON.

456
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,445
DON'T WORRY.

457
00:20:22,445 --> 00:20:24,614
WE'LL BE BACK SOON,
I PROMISE.

458
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:27,117
OH, GUILMON.

459
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:32,656
YOU'RE EVERYTHING TO US,
TAKATO.

460
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,324
PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

461
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:37,294
I WILL, MOM.
I PROMISE.

462
00:20:39,162 --> 00:20:41,298
COME ON, GUILMON,
LET'S GO!

463
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:46,636
TAKATO!

464
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:49,973
YOU CAN DO IT!

465
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:52,108
HA HA HA HA!

466
00:20:52,175 --> 00:20:55,378
GEE, I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
IN MY EYE...

467
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:57,614
TO FIND OUT IF THEY CAN SAVE
JERI AND THE WORLD,

468
00:20:57,681 --> 00:21:00,951
TUNE IN TO THE NEXT
"DIGIMON -- DIGITAL MONSTERS."
