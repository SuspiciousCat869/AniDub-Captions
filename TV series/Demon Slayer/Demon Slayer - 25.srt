1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,944
Naho! Kiyo! Sumi!

2
00:00:03,426 --> 00:00:04,346
Huh?

3
00:00:05,246 --> 00:00:07,373
Would you mind helping me train later?

4
00:00:08,129 --> 00:00:11,063
While I'm sleeping, if I stop breathing right,

5
00:00:11,284 --> 00:00:13,417
can you hit me with these carpet beaters?

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,979
I'd appreciate it!

7
00:00:17,693 --> 00:00:18,579
We'll do it!

8
00:00:19,663 --> 00:00:20,687
Oh, thank you!

9
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,232
Nothing wrong here.

10
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:34,959
He's doing a great job.

11
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:36,252
He is.

12
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:18,974
I'm a fool.

13
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,912
Please let me try again!

14
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:22,072
Sure!

15
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:22,839
Thank you.

16
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:24,139
Try your best!

17
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:25,856
This is it.

18
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,237
One more! This time, for sure!

19
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:39,131
It's just you again today, huh?

20
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:42,948
I'm sorry. I did ask them to come, but...

21
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:45,025
Well, it doesn't matter to me.

22
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:48,253
I'll go talk to them about it later.

23
00:02:55,474 --> 00:02:59,475
I'm starting to get used to training
while doing total concentration breathing.

24
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,516
I still can't keep it up for the whole
day unless I really get myself pumped up.

25
00:03:06,802 --> 00:03:07,802
Even so,

26
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:11,930
the longer I continue doing it,
the greater my stamina becomes.

27
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:32,354
You can do it!

28
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,405
Look at that.

29
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,398
I'm not far behind her.

30
00:03:47,225 --> 00:03:48,682
I can do this!

31
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,021
Thank you for your training!

32
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:12,678
Hmph!

33
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:13,276
Eh?

34
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,648
Zenitsu! Inosuke!

35
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:22,545
I'm not helping you with them.

36
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:34,485
Keep at it!

37
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,272
Keep at it! Keep at it!

38
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:46,929
I did it!

39
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:52,125
Now all you have to do is break is this huge gourd!

40
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:52,550
Mm-hmm.

41
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,885
You're doing great! What a relief!

42
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:55,996
Thanks, everyone!

43
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:57,500
It's because of you all!

44
00:04:57,525 --> 00:04:58,234
Not good.

45
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:15,731
Looks like Tanjiro's already gone off to train.

46
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:17,981
And at this hour of the morning?

47
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,338
Working hard isn't my thing.

48
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:24,754
Slaving away day in and day out is exhausting.

49
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,516
Eh? Chuntaro.

50
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:32,166
Maybe I'm panicking because I was left behind,

51
00:05:32,476 --> 00:05:35,769
but I can't seem to get the
hang of anything Tanjiro shows me.

52
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:39,164
It must be because I'm a lost cause, isn't it?

53
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,927
Did you just agree with me?

54
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:44,911
How can you be so cruel?

55
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,770
Would it kill you to say something like,
"you're doing your best," even just this once?

56
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,692
"Work harder," you say?

57
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:55,040
If you say so.

58
00:06:03,768 --> 00:06:04,741
Awful.

59
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:06,523
Huh?

60
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:15,162
Let's go, Monitsu.

61
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:22,880
What Tanjiro is trying to master is a
skill called total concentration, constant.

62
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:27,079
By doing total concentration
breathing all day and all night,

63
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:29,795
your stamina level will skyrocket.

64
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,422
Shall we try our hand at it?

65
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:43,742
Impossible!

66
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:45,839
This is utterly impossible!

67
00:06:45,995 --> 00:06:50,991
I still can't do total concentration breathing
all day unless I really put my mind to it,

68
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:52,813
but I bet you two can.

69
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:54,738
Go like this,

70
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:56,792
and your lungs will expand.

71
00:06:56,954 --> 00:06:58,005
Your blood shakes,

72
00:06:58,049 --> 00:07:00,116
your sinew feels like "boom! Boom!"

73
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:01,995
And that's when you gotta stop.

74
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:07,287
It just takes lots of practice!

75
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:19,072
Come now. We're talking about a skill I'd
call very elementary, so what's the problem here?

76
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:22,496
Though I will say it does require ample effort.

77
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:31,993
Tell me, are you not able to do it?

78
00:07:33,814 --> 00:07:36,944
I was sure it'd be child's play for you, Inosuke.

79
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,526
Was I wrong about that?

80
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:40,557
I guess it was just too much!

81
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:43,282
Oh, well, then. Don't you worry.

82
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,008
You can't do it, and that's that!

83
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:49,770
'Scuse me?!

84
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:52,128
Why do you think that?! I can do it!

85
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,398
Talk to me like that again, and I'll mess you up big time!

86
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:59,561
Please give it your all, Zenitsu.

87
00:07:59,738 --> 00:08:02,155
I'm your number one supporter.

88
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:06,503
Okay!

89
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:20,090
You're in their class, so why not join them?

90
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,842
There you go!

91
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,005
Keep going! Feel your blood beating like a drum! Go!

92
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,218
Stick with it, you damn weakling!

93
00:08:43,243 --> 00:08:44,590
Go!

94
00:08:44,795 --> 00:08:46,611
You got this, Zenitsu!

95
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:23,154
I hurt.

96
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:25,735
I was hungry.

97
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:28,819
I was sad.

98
00:09:29,915 --> 00:09:31,489
I felt hopeless.

99
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,897
I was in agony.

100
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:36,166
I was lonely.

101
00:09:37,883 --> 00:09:39,467
Such was my life.

102
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,348
But then, one day...

103
00:09:44,688 --> 00:09:46,647
I heard a snapping sound...

104
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:54,654
And I never knew pain again.

105
00:10:06,113 --> 00:10:07,872
I never knew pain again.

106
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:10,869
Living in poverty,

107
00:10:11,498 --> 00:10:13,719
even having my parents sell me off,

108
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,120
it didn't make me feel sad.

109
00:10:19,972 --> 00:10:22,403
Excuse me. Do you have a minute?

110
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:23,543
Huh?

111
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:29,332
I'm curious.

112
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:31,413
Why is that child is all tied up?

113
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,865
Is she a criminal, perhaps?

114
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:35,428
Isn't it obvious?

115
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:37,421
She's dirty and flea-ridden.

116
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,165
Besides, she might try to escape.

117
00:10:42,748 --> 00:10:43,615
Hello there.

118
00:10:43,762 --> 00:10:44,567
How are you?

119
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:47,317
My name is Kanae Kocho.

120
00:10:48,193 --> 00:10:49,226
What is your name?

121
00:10:56,174 --> 00:10:58,285
She doesn't have a name, all right?

122
00:10:58,637 --> 00:10:59,739
She never got one.

123
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,780
Happy now? Now go away!

124
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,287
Please don't touch my sister.

125
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:10,573
What's the deal with you two?

126
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:13,095
If you're so interested in her, then buy her!

127
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:17,104
Very well, then. We will.

128
00:11:17,697 --> 00:11:18,791
Is this enough?

129
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,055
Hey! Get back here!

130
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:32,608
You should hurry and pick all that up!

131
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:35,003
There's a strong wind and a hungry crowd.

132
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,657
Uh, are you sure about this?

133
00:11:37,684 --> 00:11:38,133
Yes.

134
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:39,930
We must be going now!

135
00:11:40,237 --> 00:11:42,852
Hands off! This is my money!

136
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:44,813
What a commotion.

137
00:12:07,588 --> 00:12:09,588
Sister, what do we do?!

138
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:12,505
This little girl is completely helpless!

139
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:13,585
Hmm?

140
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:17,596
She can't do anything on her own.

141
00:12:17,662 --> 00:12:18,979
She has to be told.

142
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:21,709
She won't even eat unless I say to,

143
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:23,847
no matter how hungry she is!

144
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:25,870
Oh, she'll be fine.

145
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,316
What are we going to do with her?

146
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:30,827
Now, now. Don't you worry so.

147
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,950
I hate to see that smile I love disappear.

148
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,151
I'm serious! Taking a kid under our wing
who can't even think for herself is reckless!

149
00:12:40,322 --> 00:12:42,086
Well, you do have a point.

150
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:45,372
She can't make decisions, even simple ones!

151
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,003
Next time you're on your own,

152
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:50,314
flip this coin to help you make a choice.

153
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:51,594
That sound good?

154
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,632
Oh, come on!

155
00:12:54,176 --> 00:12:56,564
How can you be so cross with Kanao here?

156
00:12:57,103 --> 00:12:58,903
Look how adorable she is!

157
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,951
What kind of reason is that?

158
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,574
As long as one is given a chance,

159
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:05,685
a person's soul will open up.

160
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:09,733
When you fall in love someday, you'll change, too, Kanao.

161
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,371
You're doing great! Keep it up!

162
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:18,967
Keep going!

163
00:13:18,992 --> 00:13:20,594
Even more! That's it!

164
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:22,202
You got this, Zenitsu!

165
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:24,389
Don't give up! You're doing great!

166
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:36,916
Ah.

167
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:38,943
Inosuke! Inosuke!

168
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:42,658
Hey, they're bringing our reforged nichirin swords now!

169
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:43,678
For real?

170
00:13:43,702 --> 00:13:44,192
Yeah!

171
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:45,809
I just heard it from the crow!

172
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:48,952
That's Haganezuka's scent!

173
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:51,057
Yee-hoo!

174
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:53,043
Let's go! Let's go!

175
00:13:53,944 --> 00:13:55,252
Whoo-hoo!

176
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:56,650
Oh, he's right there!

177
00:13:57,257 --> 00:13:59,973
Hey! Haganezuka!

178
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:03,611
Over here!

179
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:05,301
Long time, no see!

180
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:09,302
How have you been since we...

181
00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:15,922
H-Haganezuka?

182
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:20,023
How dare you snap my precious sword in two?!

183
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,598
You've got a lot of nerve, boy!

184
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:23,988
I-I'm sorry!

185
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:26,968
But, you know, I-I did almost die.

186
00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:29,442
My opponent was really strong!

187
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:31,583
Excuses, excuses, excuses.

188
00:14:31,608 --> 00:14:34,293
The only person you have to blame is yourself! Got it?!

189
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:36,956
If you hadn't been so pathetically
weak, it wouldn't have broke!

190
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:39,820
There's no way it would have
just snapped like that otherwise!

191
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:40,889
But I...

192
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:42,859
I'm going to kill you!

193
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:46,204
Slice you!

194
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,219
You get back here!

195
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,749
Is this a new training regimen?

196
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:52,259
I don't think so.

197
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:56,406
What can I say?

198
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,855
Haganezuka is very passionate.

199
00:14:59,295 --> 00:15:00,224
He is.

200
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:02,933
He loves his swords more than any person.

201
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:06,385
Even among other sword makers, he is one of a kind.

202
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:08,854
I can believe it.

203
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:13,639
Oh, you may address me as Kanamori.

204
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,214
I was the one who forged Master Inosuke's swords.

205
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:20,087
I hope they will be useful in battle.

206
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:30,172
Ah, beautiful, aren't they?

207
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:35,499
The dull sheen of that indigo-gray hue
is wonderful, a fine color for a sword.

208
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:39,018
Inosuke, I'm so happy you're getting a great replacement.

209
00:15:40,195 --> 00:15:41,195
Huh?

210
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,655
How do you like the hilts on them?

211
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:48,473
This is actually the first time I've
ever forged blades for a dual-wielder.

212
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:51,328
Master Inosuke?

213
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:56,557
Hmm?

214
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:06,437
Good.

215
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:08,958
I'm gonna skin you alive!

216
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:10,976
You bastard! Are you trying to provoke me?!

217
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:13,501
I'm sorry, sir! Please forgive him!

218
00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:18,614
You dirty swine!

219
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,447
That's it! You're a dead man!

220
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:22,448
We're sorry!

221
00:16:22,473 --> 00:16:25,190
Unbelievable! Just unbelievable!

222
00:16:25,382 --> 00:16:28,752
I can't believe he smashed a stone against my babies!

223
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:29,665
We're sorry.

224
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:39,194
No problems here.

225
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:41,669
Tanjiro's doing a great job!

226
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:44,796
Let's make him more rice balls! Yeah!

227
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:56,718
My body's stronger now.

228
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:59,467
I can't wait to swing my nichirin sword...

229
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:02,624
With these hands!

230
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,984
I did it!

231
00:17:10,335 --> 00:17:11,799
Nice move there!

232
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,899
You can win!

233
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:16,000
Don't let up for a second.

234
00:17:16,073 --> 00:17:17,260
You can do this!

235
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,569
I grabbed it!

236
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:24,493
Let's go!

237
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,980
This water smells bad.

238
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:27,697
I shouldn't splash it on her.

239
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:34,628
He got the water!

240
00:17:34,652 --> 00:17:35,501
It still counts, right?

241
00:17:35,526 --> 00:17:37,724
Yeah, I think he still wins either way!

242
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:38,717
Yeah!

243
00:17:39,162 --> 00:17:41,340
I did it! I did it!

244
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:42,459
Well, then...

245
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,708
I'm not gonna lose!

246
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,866
All right, say, "ahh"!

247
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:57,493
Ahh.

248
00:17:58,688 --> 00:17:59,323
Good!

249
00:17:59,348 --> 00:18:01,323
Looks like your jaw is as good as new.

250
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:03,303
You can close your mouth now.

251
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:06,144
That ends the exam.

252
00:18:06,457 --> 00:18:08,319
Since you're in physically good health,

253
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:10,874
you're fit to carry out your missions now.

254
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,057
So I'm done training?

255
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,359
Yes. Next is in-field combat.

256
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:16,998
Great!

257
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:21,389
Oh, before I forget, there's
something I wanted to ask you.

258
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:22,827
What is it?

259
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:26,106
Have you ever heard of the Hinokami Kagura?

260
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,544
I have not.

261
00:18:27,804 --> 00:18:28,790
Huh?!

262
00:18:28,844 --> 00:18:30,439
I, uh--well, then,

263
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:32,314
what about fire breathing?

264
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:33,275
Never heard of it.

265
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:39,389
Well, these are techniques that
I learned in my family growing up.

266
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:40,362
Mm. Mm-hmm.

267
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:43,457
I see.

268
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,823
So you're saying your father
seemed to be using fire breathing.

269
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:52,292
All I can tell you is that flame breathing does exist,

270
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:54,192
but that's not fire breathing.

271
00:18:54,994 --> 00:18:57,164
Huh? They're not the same thing?

272
00:18:57,584 --> 00:18:59,901
I don't quite know the details myself.

273
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:05,560
I'm sorry. But I do know that they're
very strict about the exact phrasing.

274
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:09,565
Flame breathing must never be
referred to as "fire breathing."

275
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:13,637
The flame Hashira, Rengoku, might
know something about this technique,

276
00:19:14,037 --> 00:19:16,334
but unfortunately he's out on a mission.

277
00:19:17,174 --> 00:19:18,149
I understand.

278
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:21,184
And thank you for everything that you've taught me.

279
00:19:21,397 --> 00:19:24,155
I'll ask Mr. Rengoku when I see him again.

280
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:25,240
Good.

281
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:27,002
For now, I'll be off.

282
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:28,299
Tanjiro.

283
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:29,313
Yes?

284
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,473
You'll do great things.

285
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,333
Thanks!

286
00:19:53,064 --> 00:19:54,965
She still hasn't gotten up.

287
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:03,480
I know that they said you could sleep as
much as you wanted to recover all your strength.

288
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,108
Even so, when you don't open your eyes,

289
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:08,655
I worry a bit.

290
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,127
Guess what? In not too long, I'll be leaving this place.

291
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:22,061
My body's healed, and I'm stronger.

292
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,193
I'm still practicing the new techniques, too.

293
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:29,564
And those two should be with me as well.

294
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:32,363
Having them close gives me courage.

295
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,480
Yeah.

296
00:20:37,206 --> 00:20:38,644
I'm sure you'd agree...

297
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:41,269
They're both good people.

298
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:48,731
To turn you back into a human, I have to defeat
strong demons and then send their blood to miss Tamayo.

299
00:20:50,136 --> 00:20:51,903
Am I capable of doing that?

300
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,616
I know you can do it, big brother.

301
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:07,764
Thanks, Nezuko, for spurring me on.

302
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:10,493
I vow to stay strong.
