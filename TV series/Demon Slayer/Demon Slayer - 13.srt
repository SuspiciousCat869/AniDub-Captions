1
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:18,987
I've been able to survive this
long. I know I have what it takes!

2
00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:24,921
Whether it's today or tomorrow, I can assure you this!

3
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:30,676
Without a shadow of doubt in my mind, I will not yield!

4
00:02:11,384 --> 00:02:14,409
Tanjiro, where are you right now?

5
00:02:15,296 --> 00:02:17,911
I can still hear that creepy sound.

6
00:02:18,173 --> 00:02:19,910
I just hope he's safe.

7
00:02:20,837 --> 00:02:26,020
Um, Zenitsu, is it me, or are we
just going around and around in circles?

8
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:32,396
I knew it! I was getting the exact same feeling!
I knew I could rely on you to help me out, Shoichi!

9
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:35,980
All right. Can you check to see if this room is clear?

10
00:02:37,126 --> 00:02:42,453
Hey, what's with that look?! All right,
all right, fine! You win! I'll do it myself!

11
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:53,514
There's nobody here. Let's go this way.

12
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,962
Where are you, Tanjiro? You can come out now!

13
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:02,185
Wait. Did this room just...

14
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:04,823
Flip over?!

15
00:03:25,548 --> 00:03:30,608
I can do it. I know I can. I always finish what I start.

16
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:39,817
No matter what, even with my body in this
condition, I can pull through and keep fighting!

17
00:03:46,813 --> 00:03:50,310
show him that a few broken bones isn't gonna slow me down!

18
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,929
Damn it! I can't win like this.

19
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:07,018
I need more than just determination.

20
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:10,715
Calm down. Use your head to think things through.

21
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,182
Think, Tanjiro! Think!

22
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:24,046
That was close. I barely scraped by there.

23
00:04:24,686 --> 00:04:30,265
Curses! This is irritating. I need to
consume some Marechi before it's too late.

24
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:37,489
There's not even time to think!

25
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:42,463
Hey, you! What's your name?

26
00:04:44,537 --> 00:04:45,749
It's Kyogai.

27
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:52,961
Kyogai! Listen, I'm not giving
you that child! I won't bend to you!

28
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:54,611
It's futile!

29
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,386
Don't you see that it's futile?

30
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:07,832
I will get my hands on that boy and reclaim
my rightful place among the Twelve Kizuki!

31
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:23,161
Don't you see that it's futile?

32
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:28,280
This is so boring!

33
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:39,290
Disappointing. Your writing is absolutely insipid.

34
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:43,907
Every last word on these pages is utterly trite!

35
00:05:45,573 --> 00:05:49,027
There's no beauty, vulnerability, or impact.

36
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:56,289
Why don't you forget this fantasy of being a
writer? It would simply be a waste of ink and paper.

37
00:05:57,495 --> 00:06:05,044
It doesn't help that you never even step outside
anymore. It's no wonder you're such a dull individual.

38
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:11,436
And, if that's the case, you might as well
stick with your original hobby of playing the drum.

39
00:06:12,684 --> 00:06:17,144
Not that you're good enough to be
more than an amateur with that, either.

40
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,306
Damn insect! Get out of my sight!

41
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,020
Rapid drumming!

42
00:06:55,134 --> 00:06:57,908
Don't tell me he can strike that drum even faster!

43
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:22,052
The speed of these rotations is making me
dizzy! This is bad. What a terrifying skill.

44
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:27,632
Not only that, but now he's
using five claws instead of three!

45
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:40,845
I got it!

46
00:07:45,609 --> 00:07:48,577
Now that I've dodged his strikes
without stepping on those papers,

47
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:52,419
I can protect my wounds, because I
know how to move around and breathe.

48
00:07:54,114 --> 00:07:55,959
Take quick, shallow breaths.

49
00:07:57,865 --> 00:08:01,711
Use that breathing technique to reinforce
the muscles around your broken leg!

50
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:07,961
Also, right before the claw attack,
there's a strong scent of mold.

51
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,461
I smell it! Here it comes!

52
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:15,392
from above!

53
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:16,892
Left!

54
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:18,275
Right!

55
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:19,275
From behind!

56
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:23,141
He's evading all of my attacks.

57
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:29,738
Total concentration. Water breathing.

58
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:41,977
Ninth form, splashing water flow, turbulent!

59
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,160
Minimize the landing time and area as much as possible.

60
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:48,795
He's adapting to the changes of the room.

61
00:08:49,465 --> 00:08:52,221
Go, Tanjiro. Get within striking distance.

62
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:55,476
Closer. Don't give him any room to breathe!

63
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,476
I see the opening thread.

64
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:01,726
Kyogai!

65
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:05,062
Your blood demon art was truly incredible!

66
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:30,842
I took a deep breath by mistake.

67
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:37,265
It's okay, Tanjiro, you can bear this. It'll pass!

68
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:39,878
Boy...

69
00:09:42,177 --> 00:09:43,805
Answer me.

70
00:09:46,074 --> 00:09:51,852
Did you really think my blood demon art... was incredible?

71
00:09:54,305 --> 00:09:57,392
I truly did. However...

72
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:02,501
I can't forgive you for killing.

73
00:10:06,793 --> 00:10:08,125
I see.

74
00:10:10,997 --> 00:10:13,511
Oh, that's right. Gotta get a blood sample.

75
00:10:25,902 --> 00:10:27,261
Wow, it worked.

76
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:31,264
He said it would automatically
extract blood when applied like this,

77
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:35,186
but seeing it in action proves
how crafty Yushiro really is.

78
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:40,655
A cat?

79
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:44,793
Oh! You're the one who's going to
deliver this to miss Tamayo, right?

80
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:47,647
Here we are. Good kitty!

81
00:10:51,355 --> 00:10:52,221
You're all set!

82
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,352
All right. Take care!

83
00:11:01,382 --> 00:11:05,486
I was told that, under Yushiro's spell,
it would be invisible until it meowed,

84
00:11:05,718 --> 00:11:08,231
and then vanish again when it meowed a second time.

85
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:10,516
So it's true, then.

86
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:16,493
Those kids. I gotta find them!

87
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:25,248
My--my writing...

88
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:32,604
Disappointing. Your writing is absolutely insipid.

89
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:36,636
Every last word on these pages is utterly trite!

90
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:41,931
There's no beauty, vulnerability, or impact.

91
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:47,117
It wasn't worthless.

92
00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:52,084
At the very least, that child didn't believe so.

93
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:55,797
He respectfully avoided trampling upon my work.

94
00:11:57,562 --> 00:11:59,395
May your soul rest in peace.

95
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:13,380
Both my blood demon art and my drum playing...

96
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:18,135
Have been recognized.

97
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:35,856
Kiyoshi! Teruko! Are you here? Answer me!

98
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:39,056
Teruko! Kiyoshi!

99
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:47,612
Sorry, Tanjiro.

100
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:50,800
Why are the two of you throwing stuff at me?

101
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:55,135
We're sorry. The drum we were
using disappeared, so we panicked.

102
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:59,547
I see. Well, you're safe. I'm glad.

103
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:12,391
You did a great job hanging in there. You,
too, Kiyoshi. Come on. Let's head outside.

104
00:13:13,387 --> 00:13:14,637
Kiyoshi, hop on.

105
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:18,347
How's your leg feeling?

106
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,597
Not too bad.

107
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,707
Just hang on a little longer.

108
00:13:23,097 --> 00:13:28,102
I'm picking up Zenitsu and Shoichi's
scent. They're probably outside.

109
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,030
Seems they're both sa...

110
00:13:31,013 --> 00:13:32,109
I smell blood.

111
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,258
What's the matter?

112
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,714
Nothing. Let's hurry along.

113
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:49,518
Take this! Come on! Move it!

114
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:53,997
Now, you spineless coward! Draw your sword, and face me!

115
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:01,819
Tanjiro...

116
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,454
The box, I protected it.

117
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:13,956
You told me... This was more
important to you than your own life.

118
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,456
That's why I did it.

119
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:28,206
The fact is, I've always had really good hearing.

120
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:36,706
There have been times when I knew what
people said, even though I had been fast asleep.

121
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,976
That really creeped everyone out.

122
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:47,751
I don't hear any more demons. You
must have finished the job, Tanjiro.

123
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:55,206
I can hear you all and also
these odd-sounding, loud footsteps.

124
00:14:56,415 --> 00:15:01,456
Zenitsu! Zenitsu! Please, wake up!

125
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,115
Oh. Thank goodness! Are you all right?

126
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:14,180
When the room spun around earlier,
we ended up getting thrown outside.

127
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:16,745
We fell from the second-story window.

128
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:20,777
Did we, really?

129
00:15:20,882 --> 00:15:26,030
Yeah, you made sure that I was protected at the
time, though, so I didn't end up getting hurt at all.

130
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,829
I'm glad to hear that. So what's with all the tears, then?

131
00:15:37,757 --> 00:15:41,403
Now I understand! I fell right onto my head, didn't I?!

132
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:42,563
Yes.

133
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,219
Am I gonna... am I gonna die?!

134
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:49,469
Oh, no. The world is starting
to spin. Is this the end for me?!

135
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,474
What's going on? I don't like that sound!

136
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:57,120
Watch out, 'cause, ready or not, I'm comin' through!

137
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,798
There it is again, that terrifying boar monster!

138
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,930
Picking up a demonic presence here.

139
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:13,037
Hey, wait. I know where I've heard that
voice before. He's the fifth survivor.

140
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:19,076
During final selection, he was the first to rush
up the mountain and the first to come back down.

141
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,717
What a force of nature!

142
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:21,560
Hmm?

143
00:16:26,363 --> 00:16:28,472
I've found you, demon!

144
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:31,969
Stop it!

145
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:38,593
What the hell? Who are you? Get outta my way!

146
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:44,193
My name is Zenitsu Agatsuma! I'm
a demon slayer, the same as you!

147
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:46,804
Oh? Are you, now?

148
00:16:47,248 --> 00:16:51,399
Then, you should already know! We
gotta get rid of that thing at all costs!

149
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:53,977
Now get the hell out of my way!

150
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:56,490
I refuse! This belongs to Tanjiro...

151
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,373
Don't you argue with me!

152
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:04,922
I'll deal with him and his box if that's
the case. I won't say it again. Move!

153
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:09,623
Do you wanna die?

154
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,931
This box, I won't let you touch it!

155
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,852
I don't know what's inside, but I
know that it's precious to Tanjiro!

156
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:25,351
Are you serious? Use your damn head!
There's a demon in that box! Don't you get that?

157
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,812
Of course I do! I've known that from the very start!

158
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:33,273
I knew he was traveling with a demon,

159
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,158
because the sounds demons make
aren't anything like a human.

160
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:46,085
That said, the sounds I hear from Tanjiro
are so kind and gentle, it makes me want to cry.

161
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:50,839
I don't think I've ever heard anything like it before.

162
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:59,589
All living creatures constantly give off
vibrations. The world is full of sounds ringing out...

163
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:05,022
Breathing, heartbeats, the rhythm of blood circulating.

164
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:10,734
By listening closely, I'm able to tell what
kind of thoughts are going through someone's head.

165
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:15,613
Even so, I've been deceived by others many times.

166
00:18:16,491 --> 00:18:21,007
That's because I've always stubbornly
believed in whomever I wanted.

167
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:26,879
Tanjiro, despite being a demon
slayer, is traveling with a demon,

168
00:18:27,663 --> 00:18:31,378
but I'm sure he has a good reason for doing so.

169
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:36,378
Whatever that reason may be, I'm
sure I can put my faith behind it.

170
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:38,878
I'll do it.

171
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:49,397
I'll ask him. I'll ask Tanjiro about the demon
myself. Until that happens, just leave it alone!

172
00:18:57,882 --> 00:18:59,702
Let go of me, damn it!

173
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:02,706
You're a pest!

174
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:10,309
I won't let you touch that!

175
00:19:13,004 --> 00:19:17,187
It's important to Tanjiro. Stay away from it!

176
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,988
You're not laying a finger on it until he gets back!

177
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,461
Damn you!

178
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:28,337
Take this!

179
00:19:32,098 --> 00:19:33,133
Move it!

180
00:19:33,658 --> 00:19:35,038
No! I refuse!

181
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,551
Take this! Come on! Move it!

182
00:19:44,576 --> 00:19:49,018
Now, you spineless coward! Draw your sword, and face me!

183
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,018
Tanjiro...

184
00:19:58,673 --> 00:20:01,393
The box, I protected it.

185
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:08,788
You told me. This was more
important to you than your own life.

186
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,321
That's why I did it.

187
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:19,472
You idiot! After all that bluster,
you don't even bother to draw your sword!

188
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:23,470
If you're a fellow demon slayer, then let's see you fight!

189
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:33,353
If you're not gonna fight,
then get the hell out of my way!

190
00:20:40,056 --> 00:20:41,256
Move aside!

191
00:20:50,547 --> 00:20:55,619
Fine, then. If all you're gonna
do is keep me from doing my job,

192
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:59,972
then you leave no choice, but to
take you out along with that box!

193
00:21:05,191 --> 00:21:06,316
Stop it!

194
00:21:13,124 --> 00:21:17,949
I said stop!
