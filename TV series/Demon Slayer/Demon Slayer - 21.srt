1
00:00:09,126 --> 00:00:10,124
Gotcha!

2
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:15,411
Nice one.

3
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:44,357
Rui? Rui!

4
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:50,848
Rui! What are you doing?
You know you're not supposed to be outside!

5
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:36,049
Since the day I was born, I've always been very frail.

6
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:41,931
I couldn't run. Even just walking was a struggle for me.

7
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:49,439
That is... Until Master Muzan appeared.

8
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:58,529
You poor thing. I'll save you from this harsh life.

9
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,460
My parents weren't happy about it.

10
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:19,302
Since I'd acquired a strong body, I could never expose
myself to sunlight, and of course I had to devour humans.

11
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:29,142
What have you done? What on earth have you done, Rui?
Answer me!

12
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,109
Long ago, I heard a wonderful story.

13
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:48,168
There was once a Father who died
trying to save his drowning child.

14
00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:02,018
I was deeply moved.
Such astounding display of parental love, a true bond.

15
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:06,548
This Father who drowned
had fulfilled his role as a guardian wonderfully,

16
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:11,035
but I wasn't bestowed the same kind of devotion.

17
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:22,905
When it came to my own parents, they tried to kill me.

18
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:29,211
All my Mother did was cry,
never lifting a finger to protect me.

19
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:50,410
They must have been imposters.
Our bond wasn't the genuine one at all, I thought.

20
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,419
I'm... Sorry.

21
00:04:57,745 --> 00:05:02,172
She's saying something. I thought she was dead.

22
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:08,405
I'm sorry...
That I couldn't give you a strong, healthy body.

23
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:17,081
Those... Were the last words my Mother ever spoke to me.
She was dead.

24
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:23,592
Rui, listen. We're going to die with you!

25
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:30,760
I was so enraged he had tried to kill me,
the meaning of his words escaped me.

26
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:33,722
But I came to realize soon after

27
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:38,885
he intended to atone on my behalf
for the sin of having killed someone,

28
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,740
in the form of taking his own life.

29
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:54,207
It was a genuine bond,
and that night, I had severed it with my own two hands.

30
00:05:56,243 --> 00:06:01,207
After all that, however,
Master Muzan gave me words of encouragement.

31
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:09,547
It was all your parents's fault for refusing to
accept you for who you are. Take pride in your own power.

32
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:17,812
I had no other choice but to see it that way.
I couldn't bear the weight of what I'd done.

33
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:25,366
I knew that I only had myself to blame.

34
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:40,015
Every single day,
I missed my parents so much, I could barely stand it.

35
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:45,988
Even after crafting a family of my own,
that emptiness remained.

36
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:53,075
Because I was the strongest,
I couldn't depend on anyone to protect me, no one.

37
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:59,785
The more powerful I became, the more distant
my memories of being human became as well.

38
00:07:00,844 --> 00:07:04,489
I began losing sight
of what it was I wanted in the first place.

39
00:07:13,236 --> 00:07:17,236
I sought out a bond that I was
never able to claim for myself,

40
00:07:17,911 --> 00:07:21,666
not in my old life, nor the new one I created.

41
00:07:33,101 --> 00:07:39,564
This body is giving off a scent,
one of grief too overwhelming for him to bear.

42
00:07:56,995 --> 00:08:01,624
So warm. Hands as gentle as sunbeams.

43
00:08:05,293 --> 00:08:10,911
I remember now, clear as day. I had wanted to apologize.

44
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:17,424
I'm sorry. I was... I was to blame for everything.

45
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,032
I hope you can forgive me.

46
00:08:23,374 --> 00:08:29,028
I've killed so many people, though.
Surely I'm going to hell, aren't I?

47
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:36,083
Father, Mother,
I can't go to the same place as you, can I?

48
00:08:38,223 --> 00:08:45,394
That's not true.
We'll be together, no matter where you go.

49
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:50,545
Rui.

50
00:08:52,477 --> 00:08:56,590
Oh, Father... And Mother.

51
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,495
Darling. We'll be with you always.

52
00:09:12,238 --> 00:09:20,084
It was my fault. All of it was my
fault. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry!

53
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:23,624
I'm so sorry! Forgive me!

54
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:53,349
Don't waste your sympathy. It was a demon.
The fact it looked like a child makes no difference.

55
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:57,310
It lived for decades, terrorizing our people.

56
00:09:58,046 --> 00:10:04,446
If it's for the sake of avenging those who were killed,
to make sure there are no more victims,

57
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:09,002
I won't hesitate
to bring my blade down on any demon's neck.

58
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:14,303
But when it comes to those who felt despair and regret
from the actions they took as a demon,

59
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:16,500
I will never disrespect them!

60
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:24,597
Because at one time or another...
They were human, no different from me!

61
00:10:25,783 --> 00:10:28,189
So please don't step on his remains!

62
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:37,744
They're not hideous monsters at all.
Instead, demons are hopeless creatures, tragic creatures.

63
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,779
Isn't she...

64
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:00,919
Oh, my.

65
00:11:05,672 --> 00:11:08,232
Why would you get in my way, Tomioka?

66
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:15,075
And after you told me we could never
be friends with demons. I have to say...

67
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:20,320
This kind of thing is exactly why no one likes you.

68
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:50,106
Incredible. This antidote of Lady Kocho's
is very effective, isn't it?

69
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:59,117
Indeed, and she prepared it after a mere glance
at this situation. She's truly amazing. As is he.

70
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:02,539
That boy? How so?

71
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:07,395
He defeated that demon, which in turn,
slowed the circulation of the poison just a bit.

72
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:15,380
All right! This should do it! We're in good shape.
Looks like they'll all pull through.

73
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:21,549
That's good. I'd like to wrap things up as quickly
as possible and leave this place. Wouldn't you?

74
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:25,928
No argument here.
This mountain has a really hideous stench to it.

75
00:12:35,123 --> 00:12:38,257
Now then, Tomioka, would you please move?

76
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:44,239
I don't... I don't think I'm disliked.

77
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:53,379
Oh, dear. I do apologize.
You're only just hearing about this now, then?

78
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:56,903
I'm sorry. I didn't mean for you to find out this way.

79
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:03,524
Boy!

80
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:04,641
Yes, ma'am!

81
00:13:04,923 --> 00:13:09,781
What you're protecting there is actually a demon,
so please move away before you get hurt.

82
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:16,478
No. You're mistaken! Well, you're not
mistaken, but she's my little sister!

83
00:13:16,822 --> 00:13:18,955
She's my sister, and that's why...

84
00:13:19,338 --> 00:13:23,544
Oh, my. Is that really true? You poor thing.

85
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:30,117
In that case, so she won't suffer,
I'll use a gentle toxin in order to kill her.

86
00:13:33,274 --> 00:13:34,174
Can you move?

87
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:40,644
Even if it's difficult, you need to go.
Take your sister, and run.

88
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:42,684
Tomioka...

89
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:46,620
Thank you. I appreciate this!

90
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,875
Did you... Just break the rules of the Corps?

91
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:08,948
My whole body is aching so much, I wanna scream,
but I have to keep going and endure it!

92
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:12,554
Endure! Endure! Endure! Endure!

93
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:21,186
Does this mean
I'm gonna have to leave the Demon Slayer Corps?

94
00:14:21,505 --> 00:14:26,135
Even if she's my sister, there's no way
they'd let one of their swordsmen travel with a demon!

95
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:36,516
I see you're dead serious about this.
Who would have thought a Hashira would defend a demon?

96
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,447
Whatever your intentions are, I'm afraid I don't
feel like playing this game of stalling for time,

97
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:48,197
and so good day to you.

98
00:14:59,438 --> 00:15:01,869
Is this your attempt at catching up with me?

99
00:15:10,516 --> 00:15:16,369
I don't have any objections to you trying to stop me,
but don't forget there's someone else to watch out for.

100
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:29,619
Don't stop running! Keep on moving!
You gotta run as far away as you can!

101
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:43,440
Damn it! What just happened? I
wasn't aware of my surroundings. Nezuko!

102
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,393
A Demon Slayer?

103
00:15:52,545 --> 00:15:58,937
Get out of here, Nezuko! Run away as fast as you can!
Don't get caught, no matter what! Hurry!

104
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:12,041
Did she just shrink into a child?

105
00:16:21,586 --> 00:16:25,476
She's just running away
without even throwing out an attack. Why?

106
00:16:29,618 --> 00:16:33,219
Well, it doesn't matter. My orders are to slay this demon.

107
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:41,066
Tomioka... There's something I want to say.

108
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:44,772
Since the purpose of my attack was to slay a demon,

109
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,150
it certainly wouldn't be construed
as a violation of the Corps,

110
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:54,945
but what you're doing is clearly against the rules.
You're preventing me from slaying a demon.

111
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,166
What are your intentions here?

112
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:08,260
Don't you have anything to say for yourself? This will be
your final warning. At least give me some sort of reason.

113
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,166
As I recall, it was two years ago.

114
00:17:17,624 --> 00:17:22,609
Are you about to go into a long-winded story
from the past just to spite me?

115
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,452
It's because of what I said to you earlier. Is that it?

116
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,821
Message! Message!

117
00:17:35,217 --> 00:17:37,260
I have a message from headquarters!

118
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:42,755
Tanjiro and Nezuko are to be taken into custody
and brought back to headquarters!

119
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:51,380
Tanjiro and the demon Nezuko are to be taken
into custody and brought back to headquarters!

120
00:17:51,623 --> 00:17:56,507
Tanjiro, dressed in a checkered Haori,
with a scar on his forehead!

121
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:00,570
Nezuko, a demon girl with a bamboo muzzle!

122
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:03,258
Are you Nezuko?

123
00:18:07,526 --> 00:18:09,931
Bring them back! Bring them back!

124
00:18:11,395 --> 00:18:15,752
Tanjiro, dressed in a checkered Haori,
with a scar on his forehead!

125
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:19,282
Nezuko, a demon girl with a bamboo muzzle!

126
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,301
Bring them back! Bring them back!

127
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:27,110
He does have a scar.

128
00:18:27,246 --> 00:18:29,056
All right, let's bring him in.

129
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:33,171
Look. His jawbone seems to be broken, doesn't it?

130
00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:35,948
I feel bad about tying him up.

131
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:42,057
Wh-who the hell is this?

132
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:45,115
I don't know. A demon? No, it couldn't be.

133
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:46,774
Is it human?

134
00:18:47,736 --> 00:18:49,578
He's wearing our uniform trousers.

135
00:18:50,884 --> 00:18:53,639
Oh, wait. This is a mask. He is human!

136
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,031
All right, let's bring him in.

137
00:18:57,424 --> 00:18:59,924
Ah, this guy's been beaten up really bad.

138
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:02,970
Why's he strung up like this?

139
00:19:05,623 --> 00:19:13,532
There was nothing I could do.
On my own, I couldn't bring down even a single demon.

140
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:18,769
You know what? Maybe I'm not that strong.

141
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,694
They wrapped us all up, huh?

142
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:36,854
Who are these people?
They seem to be cleaning up this place really efficiently.

143
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:41,804
And that girl there,
isn't she the girl from final selection?

144
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:45,291
She has the same kind of hair ornament
as the lady who wrapped us up.

145
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:48,452
Should we bring them as well?

146
00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:55,296
Yes, go to the butterfly mansion. I'll be
hunting down the demons here, so you can rest easy.

147
00:19:56,133 --> 00:20:00,153
I think I've heard of these guys.
