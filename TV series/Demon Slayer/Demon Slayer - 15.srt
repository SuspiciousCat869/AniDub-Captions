1
00:00:07,813 --> 00:00:08,673
Tanjiro.

2
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:12,748
You didn't.

3
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:19,005
Did you think I joined the Demon Slayer Corps because
I thought it was gonna be all sunshine and rainbows?!

4
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:19,517
Well, I...

5
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:22,507
Guys like you should be erased
from this world immediately!

6
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:29,098
You shall face justice! Don't ever disrespect the Corps!

7
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,923
Hi, Nezuko!

8
00:02:19,978 --> 00:02:22,244
How are you today?

9
00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:32,642
Where are you going, Nezuko?

10
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:35,516
Wait for me!

11
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,096
Zenitsu, stop following her already!

12
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:44,945
Tanjiro...

13
00:02:49,163 --> 00:02:51,678
Let's be best friends, Tanjiro!

14
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,540
Zenitsu, why are you following
us around like this? Stop it!

15
00:02:55,565 --> 00:02:58,914
Oh, come on, don't be a stranger, Tanjiro!

16
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,762
You've got to cut this out right now!

17
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,916
Man, I'm hungry.

18
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:11,675
Pardon me, good sir.

19
00:03:17,787 --> 00:03:22,431
I cannot help but notice those
clothes of yours are rather soiled.

20
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:29,370
It would be my pleasure to clean them for
you, so please wear these in the meantime.

21
00:03:31,388 --> 00:03:35,441
I believe you will find them
comfortable and pleasant to the touch.

22
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:45,453
I was thinking of making some
tempura for dinner, you know,

23
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,411
something covered in batter and fried to a golden brown.

24
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:58,353
Hey, wait up, you two! Come back here,
Nezuko! Tanjiro, where are you going?

25
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:03,602
Wh-what was that for?

26
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:10,365
Hey, hey! Don't you start chasing us now, too, Inosuke!

27
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:13,635
Save me, Tanjiro!

28
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:28,106
All better.

29
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:54,399
It is north-northeast! To the north-northeast!
Your next mission is north-northeast!

30
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,696
The three of you are to go to Mount
Natagumo! Make your way there posthaste!

31
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:09,396
We're heading out.

32
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:12,446
Thank you for everything.

33
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,918
I'll bestow good luck upon you.

34
00:05:20,435 --> 00:05:21,921
We appreciate it.

35
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:30,684
What do you think you're doing?!

36
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,773
Stop that, you idiot!

37
00:05:33,097 --> 00:05:34,452
What did you say?!

38
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:39,435
It's ceremonial! We're going on a
journey, and striking sparks is for luck!

39
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:46,701
Always live your lives in a fashion where
you are able to hold your heads up high.

40
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:49,793
I wish you luck in battle.

41
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,289
"Heads up high"? "Luck in battle"? What's that mean?

42
00:06:09,686 --> 00:06:11,979
Jeez, this guy is totally clueless.

43
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:16,548
To be honest, it is a little bit difficult to explain.

44
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:18,414
"To hold your head high,"

45
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:24,681
I guess it means, whatever hand you're given in this life,
you're able to conduct yourself in a way that's honorable

46
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,168
so you're never ashamed.

47
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:31,913
And wishing us luck in battle just
means she's praying for our safety.

48
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:37,192
Well, what about the "hand you're given"? We
have two already! And why should we be ashamed?

49
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,490
Well, I guess...

50
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:41,757
What does it mean to conduct yourself honorably, anyway?

51
00:06:41,863 --> 00:06:45,120
And why is that old hag praying
for our safety in the first place?

52
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,380
She has nothing to do with us, so what's her game, huh?

53
00:06:49,593 --> 00:06:51,994
Maybe she should worry about her own hands!

54
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,131
He sped up!

55
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,735
Is this a race? I won't let you win!

56
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,775
Wait for me, you two!

57
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:16,040
Everyone! We need to pause here.

58
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,424
Zenitsu? What's wrong?

59
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:24,067
I'm nervous, okay?! Now that we're
nearing our destination, I'm getting scared!

60
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:28,805
Why the hell is he sitting like
that? It's pretty weird, if you ask me.

61
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:31,020
Who are you to talk to me about weird?

62
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,772
You can't tell me you're not getting
any spooky vibes from that mountain!

63
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:46,510
Even so, we can't exactly just wait here.

64
00:07:46,805 --> 00:07:48,938
I told you this guy's an odd duck.

65
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:54,396
I am not an odd duck! I'm completely
normal! It's you guys that are the strange ones!

66
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,649
Tanjiro? There something wrong?

67
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:07,168
What is this smell?

68
00:08:07,964 --> 00:08:13,642
Tanjiro! Hey! Wait up! Don't leave me
here by myself! Who knows what'll happen?!

69
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:29,314
Help me. Please, help me.

70
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:33,677
Look at his uniform. That boy, he's one of us!

71
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:36,150
Hey, don't leave me behind!

72
00:08:36,364 --> 00:08:38,710
Are you all right? What happened?

73
00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:48,110
They were attached to me, too!
Please don't let me die here!

74
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:06,513
I'm going in.

75
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:14,865
I'll head in first. You stay behind
me, trembling like a scared little animal.

76
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:17,368
This is making me hungry.

77
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:19,503
Inosuke.

78
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:22,610
Why is he such a showoff?

79
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:26,384
Let's go!

80
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:32,585
What is this?

81
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:42,923
A spider web?

82
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:48,908
This place is full of 'em, as
far as the eye can see! What a pain!

83
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:50,037
Yeah, you're right.

84
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:52,812
Inosuke?

85
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:54,185
What do you want?

86
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,248
I appreciate this.

87
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:56,881
What?

88
00:10:57,653 --> 00:11:01,224
When you said you'd go check
things out with me, I was relieved.

89
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:02,705
Huh?

90
00:11:03,268 --> 00:11:09,841
That ominous scent I was picking up from the mountain
scared me a bit, so having you here makes me feel better.

91
00:11:10,722 --> 00:11:11,831
So thanks.

92
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,348
I believe you will find them
comfortable and pleasant to the touch.

93
00:11:20,642 --> 00:11:25,493
Always live your lives in a fashion where
you are able to hold your heads up high.

94
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:28,034
I wish you luck in battle.

95
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:32,214
Inosuke.

96
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:38,344
Let's go.

97
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:53,749
We've come to help out. I'm Tanjiro Kamado, rank mizunoto.

98
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,989
A mizunoto? You serious?

99
00:11:58,366 --> 00:12:00,456
They should have sent us a Hashira.

100
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:04,988
No matter how many mizunoto
they send in, it won't be enough!

101
00:12:06,614 --> 00:12:07,606
Inosuke!

102
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:08,933
Ah, shut up!

103
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:14,177
The only thing I see around here that's not enough
is this sputtering pool of sweat in front of me!

104
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:18,132
Now, how 'bout you tell us just what is going on here!

105
00:12:18,246 --> 00:12:20,270
Who do you think you're talking to?

106
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:22,350
Did you forget that I have seniority?

107
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:29,238
The crow gave us orders to come to this
place, and ten of us Corps members gathered here.

108
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,889
Not long after we entered the
mountain, that's when it started.

109
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:56,263
The slayers began killing each other.

110
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:09,024
I

111
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:13,841
I was so...

112
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:22,392
You did well to return.

113
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:27,455
It would appear that... Most
of my children have been killed.

114
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:31,327
We may very well find the Twelve Kizuki there.

115
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,390
It would seem I'll have to send in some Hashira.

116
00:13:40,796 --> 00:13:41,290
Giyu...

117
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:44,790
And Shinobu.

118
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:48,295
Understood.

119
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:55,815
If only humans and demons could get along
with each other. Wouldn't you agree, Tomioka?

120
00:13:56,817 --> 00:14:00,429
That's a pipe dream, as long as demons hunt us.

121
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:13,567
I wonder if the others hate me.

122
00:14:15,023 --> 00:14:18,595
Would someone normally leave
their friend behind like this?

123
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,720
You'd talk him through it if you were close, wouldn't you?

124
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:26,886
If they both had tried to convince
me to go, I would have. I'm sure of it.

125
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:36,232
But instead, they both went on their merry way up
that scary mountain, leaving poor, little me all alone.

126
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:54,482
You don't have a care in the world, do
you? All our human problems, you have no idea.

127
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:03,458
You think you're being cute right now?! Well, you're
really not! I don't like this side of you one tiny bit!

128
00:15:03,871 --> 00:15:08,397
Why can't you take some notes from Nezuko,
huh?! She's adorable, and she's a Demon!

129
00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:13,754
I just realized he took Nezuko along with him!

130
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:19,250
Why did he have to go and take my precious
Nezuko with him like that?! Damn you, Tanjiro!

131
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:23,233
Taking a young girl like her
into danger? Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

132
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:26,738
I'll save you, Nezuko!

133
00:15:35,632 --> 00:15:38,246
That rattling sound, what is it?

134
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,490
Not again.

135
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:40,381
Huh?

136
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:46,552
I've heard this sound before. It's the sound I heard
the moment before everyone started to kill each other.

137
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,870
Where's it coming from?

138
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,566
These guys morons or somethin'?

139
00:16:34,723 --> 00:16:38,148
They don't know that it's taboo for
us Demon slayers to fight each other!

140
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:42,942
That's not it! They're acting
odd, like they're being manipulated.

141
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:44,154
Here we go.

142
00:16:45,391 --> 00:16:47,325
I'm gonna cut 'em to pieces!

143
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:51,499
You can't do that! They're
alive! At least, I believe some are.

144
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:55,681
Besides, the bodies of the ones
who aren't are still our teammates!

145
00:16:57,396 --> 00:17:01,265
Listen, you. Stop denying me at every turn!

146
00:17:16,012 --> 00:17:18,882
I caught a strange, sweet scent from his back.

147
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:29,939
It's threads! They're being
controlled by threads! Cut them off!

148
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,911
I already knew about that before you caught on.

149
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:44,427
Where's the location of the Demon controlling them?

150
00:17:47,764 --> 00:17:51,112
What's that revolting odor? Was just for a second, though.

151
00:17:55,026 --> 00:17:56,105
Spiders?

152
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:11,401
I get it! The spiders are just attaching
people to the puppet strings. That means...

153
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:25,928
Now listen closely, my precious little
dolls. Dance until your arms and legs fall off.

154
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:32,325
Cutting the threads isn't enough. The
spiders will just replace them. So we...

155
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:38,298
That horrible smell again. What
is it? It's coming from far away.

156
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:46,045
So all we gotta do is annihilate those damn insects, huh?

157
00:18:46,322 --> 00:18:50,041
No way! They're too small, and there's
gotta be at least a million of them.

158
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:52,700
We gotta find the Demon who's controlling them instead!

159
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:53,307
Gotcha!

160
00:18:57,734 --> 00:19:04,528
It's no good, Inosuke. Listen, if you have some
kind of power that can pinpoint the Demon's location,

161
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:05,973
that would really help!

162
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:10,783
This disgusting smell has been blowing
in, but I just can't tell where it's from!

163
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,587
You there, your name?!

164
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:14,931
It's Murata!

165
00:19:14,995 --> 00:19:19,955
Murata, the two of us will take
care of the people being controlled.

166
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:21,198
In the meantime...

167
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:39,575
I will not let you disturb my family's peaceful life.

168
00:19:43,018 --> 00:19:46,764
He's floating? No. He's standing on the threads.

169
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,574
His family?

170
00:19:49,277 --> 00:19:52,549
Mother will be sure to make quick work of all of you.

171
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:55,250
Who's mother?

172
00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:07,571
Damn you!

173
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:10,937
Where the hell do you think
you're going? Fight me! Fight...

174
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:12,959
You all right, Inosuke?

175
00:20:13,268 --> 00:20:15,427
Why did he even show up, anyway?

176
00:20:15,572 --> 00:20:18,798
I don't think he's the Demon who's
controlling our people with those threads.

177
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,643
We can't focus on him now.

178
00:20:20,706 --> 00:20:23,674
Okay, okay, okay! I get it, all right?

179
00:20:25,114 --> 00:20:29,447
You want me to go find the one
who is! Shut up about it already!

180
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:38,322
Beast breathing. Seventh form, spatial awareness!

181
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,166
I've found you, you Demon!

182
00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:18,175
I won't let anyone get in our way.

183
00:21:19,814 --> 00:21:28,613
The five of us are going to live in happiness as a
family. No one on this mortal plane will tear us apart.
