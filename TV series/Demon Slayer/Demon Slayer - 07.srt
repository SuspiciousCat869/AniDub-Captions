1
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:45,410
Nezuko!

2
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:49,220
No, don't chase him! Get back here!

3
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:51,688
Come to me.

4
00:02:57,669 --> 00:02:59,136
No, Nezuko!

5
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,956
This is what Urokodaki was talking about.

6
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:12,827
Nezuko's a demon now.

7
00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:15,837
She's not a weakling.

8
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,992
She doesn't need me to protect her.

9
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:19,793
She can handle herself.

10
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:23,895
So maybe she can handle this.

11
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:29,002
If she can protect these two, I can focus on my attack.

12
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:43,729
Nezuko!

13
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:52,637
Nezuko, I'm going underground!

14
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:54,926
Keep them safe for me.

15
00:03:58,877 --> 00:03:59,869
Can you do that?

16
00:04:29,955 --> 00:04:31,270
It's a swamp.

17
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:34,582
What are those?

18
00:04:41,627 --> 00:04:44,895
It's clothing and stuff that
belonged to the people who were taken.

19
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:51,390
So many innocent victims, all murdered.

20
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,511
It's unforgivable.

21
00:04:55,701 --> 00:04:57,262
Unforgivable!

22
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:03,642
Getting hard to breathe yet?

23
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:06,882
There isn't a whole lot of air down here in the swamp.

24
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:11,774
Also, the darkness closing in on
you only adds to the weight you feel.

25
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:17,627
You can't move the way you would above ground down here.

26
00:05:17,683 --> 00:05:21,217
You should've looked before you leapt, you stupid fool!

27
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:35,837
You underestimate me.

28
00:05:36,165 --> 00:05:39,304
After all, where do you think I got my training?

29
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:44,012
The air's even thinner up on
mount Sagiri than it is down here!

30
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,543
Besides...

31
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,672
Some moves only unleash their full potential underwater!

32
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,099
Guess it goes both ways.

33
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:12,745
They move even faster here!

34
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:14,852
But it doesn't matter.

35
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:17,719
All I have to do is slash when they get close enough.

36
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:22,282
I'll use the form that works
even when I don't have sure footing.

37
00:06:23,821 --> 00:06:26,478
A quick and violent twist of my entire body,

38
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:28,707
generating a powerful vortex!

39
00:06:39,745 --> 00:06:42,151
I've got the scent, the opening thread!

40
00:06:42,848 --> 00:06:44,386
Total concentration!

41
00:06:44,993 --> 00:06:46,161
Water breathing!

42
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:48,288
Sixth form!

43
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:51,553
Whirlpool!

44
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:25,275
Can't breathe.

45
00:07:25,457 --> 00:07:26,712
I gotta get out of here!

46
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:30,461
Hurry!

47
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,203
This girl's powerful!

48
00:08:04,124 --> 00:08:06,741
Seems like she hasn't picked up any skills yet,

49
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:08,676
but she's still so strong.

50
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,306
He must have given her a massive amount of blood.

51
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:23,227
She's so fast, I can't get back down to the swamp.

52
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:29,317
At least I'm starting to pick up the
pattern in all her one-note attacks.

53
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,146
It doesn't matter if she can kick my head off

54
00:08:36,573 --> 00:08:38,561
or if my organs explode.

55
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:41,789
Demons can regenerate in no time!

56
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:52,676
That's right.

57
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:56,434
Now I'm gonna drill a hole right through your face!

58
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:04,735
Hands off my sister!

59
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:21,666
H-he just took me out?

60
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:24,832
This stupid kid beat two of me already?!

61
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:33,037
You smell horrible. You give off a scent like rotten oil.

62
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,531
I know where it comes from.

63
00:09:36,354 --> 00:09:38,622
Tell me, how many people have you killed?

64
00:09:39,126 --> 00:09:40,815
Give me a break already!

65
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:45,469
If women live too long, they turn ugly,
and then they won't taste good anymore!

66
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:47,904
I killed 'em for their own good!

67
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:52,736
You know, you should be thanking u...

68
00:09:58,436 --> 00:09:59,413
Never mind.

69
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:00,546
Huh?

70
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,304
What do you know about Muzan Kibutsuji? Tell me!

71
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:28,542
Talk to me!

72
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:31,784
Come on! Talk!

73
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:34,720
I-I can't.

74
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:42,306
I-I can't tell you.

75
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,578
I can't do it.

76
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:02,159
I just can't.

77
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:06,571
You mustn't tell a soul.

78
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,102
No one can know anything about me.

79
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:12,867
Do you understand?

80
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:17,883
Don't forget. I'm always watching you,

81
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:20,911
so if you tell anyone, I will know about it.

82
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:26,765
I can't say! I can't!

83
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,887
I can't! I can't!

84
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:30,218
I can't!

85
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,917
Now the only thing I smell is fear.

86
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,266
He's terrified!

87
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,915
I can't tell you, all right?!

88
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:59,490
I failed to get any information again.

89
00:12:07,638 --> 00:12:08,479
Nezuko!

90
00:12:14,721 --> 00:12:17,957
She's asleep, and the bleeding stopped.

91
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:20,363
So that does help her recover.

92
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:28,994
I failed. I'm sorry.

93
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,684
But just hang on.

94
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:35,021
I promise you this, I will make you human again.

95
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:01,039
Mr. Kazumi...

96
00:13:01,977 --> 00:13:03,335
Are you all right?

97
00:13:06,631 --> 00:13:08,242
I lost my fiance.

98
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:11,577
How could I be all right?

99
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:18,546
Mr. Kazumi...

100
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:23,584
You have to go on, no matter what,

101
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,721
in spite of losing people...

102
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,342
Even though it's devastating.

103
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,127
How am I supposed to do that?!

104
00:13:34,193 --> 00:13:36,500
You're just a kid! What do you know?!

105
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:57,208
I'll be on my way now.

106
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:01,270
Here.

107
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:07,707
Hopefully you'll find something of miss Satoko's in there.

108
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:34,738
You've been through this yourself, haven't you?

109
00:14:39,972 --> 00:14:42,036
I-I'm sorry!

110
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:46,022
I shouldn't have said that! Please forgive me!

111
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:48,786
I'm so sorry!

112
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:56,977
His hands are heartbreaking,

113
00:14:57,404 --> 00:14:59,956
hardened and thick from training.

114
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:02,672
They're not the hands of a boy.

115
00:15:04,797 --> 00:15:06,330
I'm leaving the girl with you.

116
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,767
Get her home safe!

117
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:11,569
I'll do that!

118
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:14,547
I promise.

119
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:31,498
I'm not alone.

120
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:35,341
How many people have you killed?

121
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:37,705
Tortured? Tormented?

122
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:43,445
I'll never forgive you, Muzan Kibutsuji.

123
00:15:43,803 --> 00:15:45,419
I'll make you pay.

124
00:15:54,427 --> 00:15:57,367
Head to Asakusa, Tokyo now!

125
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,504
Rumor has it a demon's lurking around there!

126
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,059
Caw!

127
00:16:03,122 --> 00:16:04,784
I've got another mission already?

128
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:06,564
Oh, yes, you do!

129
00:16:07,352 --> 00:16:09,054
Could you at least give me a minute?

130
00:16:09,138 --> 00:16:10,988
No time. Move it!

131
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:12,576
Come on. Just give me a chance to...

132
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:14,319
Just shut up, and get a move on!

133
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:15,273
Hey, knock it off!

134
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:39,375
The big cities have come a lot further than I expected.

135
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,748
It's nighttime, but it's so bright out.

136
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:52,118
The buildings are so tall!

137
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:53,265
What's the deal?!

138
00:16:54,874 --> 00:16:57,816
Incredible and overwhelming.

139
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,888
This is making me dizzy.

140
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:14,898
Uh, let's go this way.

141
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:19,812
So sorry to bother you.

142
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:40,443
Pardon me, sir.

143
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:40,841
Huh?

144
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:44,714
Could I get a bowl of udon with grated yam?

145
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:46,717
Why, yes. Coming right up.

146
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,325
I've never been to a place like this before.

147
00:17:56,883 --> 00:17:58,619
It's way too crowded.

148
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,102
Here's your udon with yam.

149
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:09,490
Let me know how you like it.

150
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:11,644
Oh, thank you very much.

151
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:51,666
That scent! Why is it here, and why now?!

152
00:18:59,525 --> 00:19:02,096
It's the same scent I found at my house!

153
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,413
Muzan Kibutsuji.

154
00:19:11,162 --> 00:19:13,620
it must be him! He's here!

155
00:19:25,224 --> 00:19:25,839
Huh?

156
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:29,566
I found him.

157
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,227
Daddy?

158
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:38,275
Who's that?

159
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:41,739
He's...

160
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:43,726
What is this?

161
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:44,839
Is he...

162
00:19:46,232 --> 00:19:48,619
he's living here, posing as a human!

163
00:19:51,111 --> 00:19:53,224
I'm sorry. Is there something I can do for you?

164
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:55,172
Are you all right?

165
00:19:55,197 --> 00:19:56,706
You seem to be a bit flustered.

166
00:19:57,518 --> 00:19:59,291
Darling, what's the matter?

167
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,341
Don't worry, mother.

168
00:20:10,884 --> 00:20:11,821
They're human.

169
00:20:13,096 --> 00:20:14,423
The girl and the woman,

170
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:16,372
their scent is human.

171
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:19,685
But how?

172
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:22,118
Can't you tell?

173
00:20:23,631 --> 00:20:25,212
This guy is a demon.

174
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:27,847
He eats people!

175
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,106
Who is this boy?

176
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:33,172
I really don't know.

177
00:20:33,706 --> 00:20:35,803
I'm just as confused as you are.

178
00:20:37,117 --> 00:20:39,196
I've never seen him before.

179
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,477
He must have made a mistake,

180
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:46,306
thought that I was someone else.

181
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,861
Oh, you think that's it?

182
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,440
Oh?

183
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:56,724
What's going on?

184
00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:58,261
Are you all right, sweetheart?

185
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,251
You look pale.

186
00:21:11,123 --> 00:21:12,289
No! Stop!
