1
00:00:00,857 --> 00:00:04,580
Take this! Come on! Move it!

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:09,007
Now, you spineless coward! Draw your sword, and face me!

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,619
Fine, then. You leave no choice, but
to take you out along with that box!

4
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:25,821
Stop it!

5
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:31,649
I said stop!

6
00:02:08,037 --> 00:02:10,479
Get away!

7
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:25,231
I heard it! He broke his ribs!

8
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,834
Aren't you part of the demon slayer corps?!

9
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,995
You must understand why Zenitsu refuses to draw his sword,

10
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:36,136
because it's taboo for us to
fight each other without provocation!

11
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:40,654
But here you are, giving him
a completely one-sided beating.

12
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:42,102
Is that fun for you?

13
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,501
You are the lowest of the low!

14
00:02:55,517 --> 00:02:58,734
So that's how you feel? I didn't realize.

15
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:02,947
In that case, let's fight barehanded.

16
00:03:03,155 --> 00:03:05,889
No! Did you even hear a word I just said?

17
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:06,984
Listen.

18
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:11,690
We're not supposed to fight each other in any way!

19
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:16,983
Using your hands doesn't change
things! Are you listening to me?

20
00:03:28,404 --> 00:03:32,021
Man, look at this guy. How is he able to move like that?

21
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,782
And with some of his ribs broken, no less.

22
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:55,974
If we're being fair here, Tanjiro's guilty of
going against the rules as well. He broke his bones.

23
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:15,640
The attacks he's using...

24
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,839
They're unusually low.

25
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:24,839
The way we're fighting, it's almost like

26
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,399
I'm battling a fearsome, four-legged beast!

27
00:04:30,835 --> 00:04:34,938
Get down, and go for a low blow of
your own. He won't be able to dodge this!

28
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:45,223
How is he this flexible?! It doesn't even seem human!

29
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,363
What did you think of that move?

30
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:52,989
Pretty damn amazing, don't you think?

31
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:56,693
Singing his own praises like that? Give me a break.

32
00:04:57,283 --> 00:05:00,443
Let me demonstrate what else I'm capable of.

33
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:12,209
Stop it! What are you doing? Performing a stunt
like that in your condition won't be good for you!

34
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,279
So? What do I care?!

35
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:19,571
Nothing can take away from this
moment and the pleasure I feel!

36
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:22,548
But you have to think about the future as well!

37
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,355
Why should I?

38
00:05:26,796 --> 00:05:28,278
Now calm down!

39
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:32,355
Do you hear?!

40
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:37,028
That sound! Did both of your skulls get fractured?!

41
00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:54,544
Huh?! Are you kidding me! That's what you look like?!

42
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,876
What the hell are you saying?

43
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:02,259
You got a problem with my face or something?

44
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:10,534
I don't know what to make of you right now. You've got
this ripped body, but such a delicate face to go with it.

45
00:06:11,352 --> 00:06:14,483
What? Why are you obsessed with my face all of a sudden?

46
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:18,362
No! I-I'm not! It was just an observation!

47
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,334
There's nothing wrong with your face.

48
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:26,187
In fact, the girlish shape, size,
and complexion are quite attractive!

49
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:28,741
You're a dead man! You wanna go?

50
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,374
I don't! I won't fight you anymore.

51
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,555
Come on. Head-butt me!

52
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,682
No! I'm done!

53
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:36,405
I said do it!

54
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:39,322
You're too worked up. Why don't you just sit down?

55
00:06:39,558 --> 00:06:43,233
I got a better idea! How about I tell you my name?

56
00:06:43,663 --> 00:06:47,197
It's Inosuke Hashibira. Don't you forget it!

57
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:48,878
How is that spelled, exactly?

58
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:53,478
Huh? I, I don't know how to read and write, okay?

59
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:56,862
All I know is that name was written on my...

60
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,235
Huh? What's wrong?

61
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:02,485
Guess he froze.

62
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:06,485
What's the matter?

63
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:20,757
Oh, no! He collapsed!

64
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:22,881
Is he dead?

65
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:26,841
No, he's not. I think it's a concussion.

66
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:29,879
I did head-butt him really hard, though.

67
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:32,529
But are you all right, Tanjiro?

68
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:33,517
Yeah.

69
00:07:33,814 --> 00:07:36,435
Amazing! Can I touch your head?

70
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:37,438
Sure.

71
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:44,946
That's insane. There's not a single drop of blood
from Tanjiro's head. How hard could it possibly be?

72
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:48,385
I mean, look at what it did to him.

73
00:07:48,696 --> 00:07:51,261
Tanjiro, your head is so hard!

74
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:52,536
You think so?

75
00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:22,818
He's awake!

76
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:26,062
Fight me! Fight me now! Get back here, you!

77
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:29,316
I can't believe this is how
he acts right when he wakes up!

78
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,296
What are you up to? Tell me!

79
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,454
We're having a burial.

80
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:44,789
Burial?

81
00:08:45,745 --> 00:08:47,392
Yes, and you should help out, too.

82
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:50,928
The fact of the matter is lives were lost in there.

83
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:55,026
What's the point in putting things
that have died into the ground like that?

84
00:08:55,213 --> 00:09:00,532
I'm not doing that, not on your life!
Forget that crap! Let's finish our fight!

85
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,860
This guy's cold. Did he really just
ask what the point in burying people was?

86
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,545
I understand.

87
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,029
You can't do it, because you're in too much pain.

88
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:19,000
I thought it was just the boar
guy, but they're both crazy.

89
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,459
Hey, it's all right. Everyone handles
their pain threshold differently, you know.

90
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:30,768
Moving those who died outside the mansion and then
digging graves for their bodies is extremely hard work.

91
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,247
Zenitsu, these kids, and I will
do our best, so don't you worry!

92
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,142
He's so odd.

93
00:09:37,848 --> 00:09:39,420
Strange guy.

94
00:09:41,017 --> 00:09:42,980
You should get some rest, Inosuke.

95
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,784
Sorry to ask too much of you.

96
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:53,215
Don't underestimate me, damn
it! I can Bury 100, no, 200 bodies!

97
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:56,535
I'm gonna do way more work than any of you! Just watch!

98
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,898
What's that strange man doing?

99
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,558
Just look the other way.

100
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,555
Descend the mountain! Descend the mountain!

101
00:10:26,623 --> 00:10:28,581
Is that crow talking to us?

102
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,878
This is all a bit too much.

103
00:10:31,109 --> 00:10:31,779
Yeah.

104
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:36,580
All right, everyone! It's time to follow yours truly!

105
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:46,115
Hey! Where are you going?

106
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,266
We're descending the mountain.

107
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:50,798
But we're not done with our battle yet.

108
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:53,939
You're tired, aren't you? Come on. We're heading down.

109
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,127
What?! I'm not tired at all!

110
00:10:58,636 --> 00:10:59,857
Let's fight!

111
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:08,578
No, you can't! I won't allow it!

112
00:11:08,681 --> 00:11:13,713
Don't go, Shoichi! Please, you gotta
stay with us! I've seen how powerful you are!

113
00:11:13,738 --> 00:11:17,069
I need you around to protect me from danger!

114
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,197
Stop it! He's obviously not interested!

115
00:11:19,283 --> 00:11:21,630
Don't leave me behind, Shoichi! I beg you!

116
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:23,942
Stop that this instant!

117
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,845
Hold out your hands!

118
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:40,746
That will ward off demons. As the one with
Marechi, be sure to keep that on your person.

119
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:42,848
It smells like Wisteria.

120
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:44,625
What's that?

121
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:48,330
A flower demons can't stand. Make sure not to lose it.

122
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:52,006
It's a demon repellent. It will keep them at bay.

123
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:59,949
Tanjiro, thank you for everything.
We can all get home on our own now.

124
00:12:00,883 --> 00:12:02,177
Safe travels.

125
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,330
Now, everyone, follow me! Follow yours truly!

126
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:21,017
Come on, and fight me! I swear I'm gonna
find your weak point and bring you down!

127
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:24,353
I have a name, you know. It's Tanjiro Kamado!

128
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:28,858
All right, Gonpachiro Kamaboko, I'm gonna bring you down!

129
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:30,374
Who are you talking about?

130
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,288
You, of course!

131
00:12:31,313 --> 00:12:32,219
No, you're not!

132
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:34,799
'Scuse me! Could you keep it down, please?!

133
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,458
A Wisteria family crest.

134
00:12:48,813 --> 00:12:55,440
It's time to rest! It's time to rest!
You've all had a tough day! Rest up now!

135
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:58,309
Are you sure that's okay?

136
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,553
Now that you mention it, I have been
fighting with injuries this whole time.

137
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,557
Is that a laugh or...

138
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:08,294
Let's eat this thing.

139
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:09,186
What?

140
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:13,652
Yes?

141
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:16,885
Oh. Sorry to bother you this late at night.

142
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:19,377
A ghost! It's a ghost!

143
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:19,943
Quiet!

144
00:13:20,306 --> 00:13:22,075
Who the hell are you?

145
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:26,534
Should I presume that you are all demon slayers?

146
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,223
We are. What's it to you?

147
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:29,381
Inosuke!

148
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:30,703
Please come in.

149
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:39,595
That little old lady sure walks fast.

150
00:13:40,305 --> 00:13:42,222
This is where you'll be staying.

151
00:13:47,282 --> 00:13:49,723
A change of clothes to cleanse your body.

152
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,239
And a warm meal to cleanse your soul.

153
00:13:55,057 --> 00:14:00,841
She has to be a monster! Preparing all this so
quickly? There's no way she's human! She can't be!

154
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:02,478
She's a monster grandm...

155
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:10,000
Use your chopsticks.

156
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,737
If you're really that hungry, Inosuke, have this bowl too.

157
00:14:28,663 --> 00:14:29,267
Take it.

158
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,008
I refuse!

159
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,590
Is this moron for real?

160
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:38,544
He's forgotten all about the box that was
so important to him earlier. Give me a break!

161
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:45,743
Your bedding is ready, gentlemen.

162
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,018
Again! The monst...

163
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:51,567
I'm takin' this one here.

164
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:53,161
First come, first serve!

165
00:14:53,843 --> 00:14:56,463
That's fine. You can sleep wherever you want.

166
00:14:57,866 --> 00:14:59,420
Which one do you want, Zenitsu?

167
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:03,985
Why me?!

168
00:15:05,073 --> 00:15:07,245
Our doctor is ready to see you.

169
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:08,683
Greetings.

170
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:12,944
Yes, I see.

171
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:15,530
Well, it's bad.

172
00:15:20,402 --> 00:15:23,853
Who would have guessed? All three of us have broken ribs.

173
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:31,765
This bump, though, hurts a lot more.

174
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:33,184
Sorry.

175
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:37,565
'Scuse me. Where's my apology? I'm hurting, too.

176
00:15:37,884 --> 00:15:41,471
You beat the crap out of me earlier. You sorry?

177
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:42,769
Not really.

178
00:15:43,095 --> 00:15:44,287
Just apologize!

179
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:45,143
Forget it.

180
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:46,435
Hey, be nice.

181
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:50,695
Look, Inosuke, we just won't
eat with you if you act that way.

182
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,382
How's that related?

183
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,893
Because meals always taste better
when you eat together, you know?

184
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:58,299
Yeah, he's right.

185
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:00,757
Did the two of you hit your heads or something?

186
00:16:00,841 --> 00:16:02,804
Like you're one to talk about that!

187
00:16:03,101 --> 00:16:05,770
Do you need any assistance in there?

188
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:07,283
Ahh! The monster!

189
00:16:07,308 --> 00:16:08,441
Stop that!

190
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:16,946
According to what the crow told me,
this house with the Wisteria family crest

191
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:20,584
belongs to a family that was
once rescued by demon slayers.

192
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,840
That's the reason they're housing us free of charge here.

193
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:29,151
Still, I didn't think they
would show us this much kindness.

194
00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:31,904
Pays to be with the demon slayer corps, huh?

195
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:35,598
Now that I think about it, what
made you decide to join the group?

196
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:39,875
Well, you must have had some kind of reason.

197
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:44,077
A member of the demon slayer
corps barged in on me on my mountain,

198
00:16:44,243 --> 00:16:48,857
so we competed to see who was
stronger. I took his blade as a reward.

199
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:53,455
I feel sorry for that guy.

200
00:16:54,491 --> 00:17:00,938
And then I heard of this thing called "final
selection" and the fact that demons really do exist.

201
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:03,953
So that's what drew you to the demon slayer corps.

202
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:07,868
And, hey, you grew up in the mountains. Same goes for me.

203
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:13,115
Don't lump me in with you! I don't
have anyone I could call family.

204
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:19,494
Only one thing gives me comfort in this world,
and that's testing my strength against others!

205
00:17:19,994 --> 00:17:22,734
Is that so? How sad.

206
00:17:30,824 --> 00:17:34,574
Hey, Tanjiro, there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

207
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,890
You're traveling with a demon. What is that about?

208
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:52,746
Zenitsu, you knew, and you still protected the box.

209
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:55,936
You really are a good person. You know that?

210
00:17:56,598 --> 00:17:57,352
Thank you.

211
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,427
You don't have to compliment me like that.

212
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:09,037
I've got a keen sense of smell.
That's how I knew from the start.

213
00:18:09,943 --> 00:18:13,533
You're a kind person, Zenitsu, strong, too.

214
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:17,293
Hey, I'm not that strong. Give me a break.

215
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:21,344
That's why I wanted to bring Shoichi
along with us, but you ruined it.

216
00:18:21,582 --> 00:18:24,110
Uh, but I... That's... well...

217
00:18:28,096 --> 00:18:30,830
Wh-what's happening?! Is it coming after us now?

218
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:31,915
You don't have to worry.

219
00:18:32,004 --> 00:18:34,518
How can you be so sure?! How?! How?!

220
00:18:34,543 --> 00:18:37,556
Quiet down. It's the middle of the night, Zenitsu.

221
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:43,981
Why won't he take the bait? I
took his food and everything.

222
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:51,467
Come to think of it, what exactly was
it that got him so mad before? I forget.

223
00:18:55,671 --> 00:18:58,010
It's not even locked?! You're kidding me?!

224
00:18:58,035 --> 00:18:59,092
Shh!

225
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,998
P-p-protect me!

226
00:19:01,124 --> 00:19:02,721
Someone please protect me!

227
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:04,781
Even you'll do, Inosuke!

228
00:19:04,806 --> 00:19:05,911
Stay away from me!

229
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:18,014
It's escaped!

230
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:22,063
I-I gotta hide! I'm so scared!

231
00:19:27,403 --> 00:19:28,569
Hey, Nezuko.

232
00:19:49,477 --> 00:19:52,423
That's enough activity for one day.

233
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,739
I'll introduce you. Nezuko is my...

234
00:19:56,764 --> 00:19:57,595
Tanjiro.

235
00:20:01,572 --> 00:20:02,855
You didn't.

236
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,183
Hey, what's wrong?

237
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,610
Tell me you didn't.

238
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,826
Just who do you think you are?

239
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:20,044
You've been traveling with a girl... This adorable?

240
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:26,592
Hanging around with someone this cute day in and day out
and been having a great time in the process, haven't you?

241
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,417
Wait a minute. That's not...

242
00:20:29,454 --> 00:20:32,279
Well, then, why did I bear all that pain and suffering?!

243
00:20:32,454 --> 00:20:39,117
Tanjiro, you jerk! You getting to be all, "ooh," and,
"mwah," with a cutie is not what I was toiling away for!

244
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:44,208
I did not put myself in harm's way to get
pummeled and kicked around by a crazy boar guy!

245
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:47,502
Zenitsu, calm down! What has gotten into you?

246
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:52,071
Did you think I joined the demon slayer corps because
I thought it was gonna be all sunshine and rainbows?

247
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:52,568
Well, I...

248
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:56,591
Guys like you should be erased
from this world immediately!

249
00:20:56,876 --> 00:21:03,304
I will finally make you pay for thwarting my marriage,
as well as sending my savior and protector Shoichi home.

250
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:10,081
You shall face justice! Don't ever disrespect the corps!

251
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:13,345
You fiend! How could you!

252
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,088
Zenitsu, cut it out!

253
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:26,853
Mock the demon slayers corps, and you'll get
sent straight to hell! You shall feel my wrath!
