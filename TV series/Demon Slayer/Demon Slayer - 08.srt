1
00:00:05,675 --> 00:00:06,348
Oh?

2
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:07,915
What's going on?

3
00:00:07,955 --> 00:00:09,248
Are you all right, sweetheart?

4
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:12,291
You look pale.

5
00:00:16,095 --> 00:00:17,295
No! Stop!

6
00:02:01,065 --> 00:02:01,827
What is it?

7
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:02,601
What's wrong?

8
00:02:02,626 --> 00:02:03,814
Is that blood?

9
00:02:06,177 --> 00:02:07,935
Stop! No!

10
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,861
No! Sweetheart!

11
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:18,342
Listen!

12
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:20,389
You need to worry about yourself, ma'am!

13
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:23,719
Cover that wound, and apply as much pressure as you can!

14
00:02:28,052 --> 00:02:30,410
It's all right. It'll all turn out fine.

15
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,742
The woman's wound doesn't look fatal.

16
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:34,515
Press down harder!

17
00:02:34,775 --> 00:02:37,521
It needs more pressure! Tie it down with a rope!

18
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:39,294
It's gonna be okay.

19
00:02:39,484 --> 00:02:41,288
This man hasn't killed anyone yet.

20
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:47,817
A few seconds ago, this guy was minding
his own business, walking down the street!

21
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,374
Are you all right?

22
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:52,121
Don't look, okay?

23
00:02:52,908 --> 00:02:55,552
Rei, I think we should go. It's not safe.

24
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:56,751
Where is he?

25
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:10,853
Damn.

26
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:12,473
Damn it all!

27
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,725
I can't leave this man alone here.

28
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,401
Muzan Kibutsuji!

29
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:23,737
No matter where you go,

30
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,242
I promise you won't escape me!

31
00:03:26,562 --> 00:03:29,085
What's the matter with that boy, Tsukihiko?

32
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:31,213
Tsukihiko?

33
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,275
You can run as far as you want!

34
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:39,257
I'll follow you to the ends of hell,

35
00:03:39,474 --> 00:03:41,992
and my blade will be the last thing you see!

36
00:03:42,197 --> 00:03:44,449
I'll never forgive you for what you've done!

37
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:47,148
What the hell's going on over here?

38
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:48,805
Another drunk.

39
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:51,329
Step away from that man right now, kid!

40
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:52,356
I can't!

41
00:03:52,427 --> 00:03:55,052
Bring restraints to hold him down! Quickly!

42
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,570
Get away from him. Get up!

43
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,282
Please don't do that!

44
00:03:58,374 --> 00:04:00,324
I'm the only one who can hold him back!

45
00:04:00,477 --> 00:04:01,252
Get off!

46
00:04:01,277 --> 00:04:02,751
I'm begging you, no!

47
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:04,875
Get a load of this guy's face.

48
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,827
Looks like he's lost his mind!

49
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:08,527
Help me get the kid off him!

50
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,694
Let me go! I don't want to let this person kill anybody!

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,711
Just stay out of the way! Someone could get hurt!

52
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:18,454
Damn it. Listen to me!

53
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,816
If you keep resisting, I'll have to use force.

54
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:30,137
Scent of illusory blood.

55
00:04:30,316 --> 00:04:31,713
Visual dream.

56
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:34,733
That smell, what is it?

57
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,657
Huh? What's with the flowers?

58
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:43,261
The hell is this?! I can't see anything!

59
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,042
Some kind of spell?

60
00:04:46,221 --> 00:04:47,521
That could mean trouble.

61
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,050
The smell's getting stronger.

62
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:03,349
I beg your pardon, but you said, "person,"

63
00:05:04,426 --> 00:05:07,558
even though this particular person is now a demon,

64
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:10,244
and now you're trying to save him.

65
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:13,558
So, if you don't mind,

66
00:05:13,618 --> 00:05:15,338
I'd like to lend you a hand.

67
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:17,471
Why in the world would you...

68
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:20,437
your scent. I know what you are.

69
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:23,657
You do. I'm a demon.

70
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:28,568
But I am also a doctor.

71
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:30,499
I want to help,

72
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:33,884
and I want to destroy Kibutsuji as well.

73
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:40,593
You're not coming with us, daddy?

74
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:42,610
No, daddy has work to do.

75
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:44,885
I have to go to a boring old business meeting,

76
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,227
and I'm worried about what just happened.

77
00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:49,619
Oh, darling.

78
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:50,791
Not to worry.

79
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:53,309
I'm just going down to check in with the police.

80
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:55,115
Now hop in.

81
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:01,472
Promise you'll come home soon, okay, daddy?

82
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:04,197
I will. Be a good girl for mommy.

83
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:05,977
Take them back to the house.

84
00:06:06,554 --> 00:06:07,394
Quickly, please.

85
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:23,480
Come on! Let's hit one more bar!

86
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,853
Are you feeling all right there?

87
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,588
Yeah, I'm fine!

88
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:30,170
I'm not even a little bit drunk yet... huh?

89
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,278
Hey, what the hell are you doing, mister?

90
00:06:35,957 --> 00:06:37,085
Apologies.

91
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,161
Where you goin'?

92
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:46,513
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm in a bit of a hurry.

93
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,792
What the hell'd you say to me?

94
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,984
Look at you, all decked out in your fancy-pants clothes.

95
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,159
You're pissin' me off,

96
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:57,967
you and your stupid pale face.

97
00:06:58,373 --> 00:07:00,870
You look like you're about to fall over dead.

98
00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:07,622
aren't you gonna say anything, or did you just croak?

99
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,689
Hmm?

100
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,494
No!

101
00:07:14,587 --> 00:07:16,370
What'd you do to my kid brother?

102
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:18,884
No! He's dead!

103
00:07:19,497 --> 00:07:21,375
This monster killed him!

104
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:24,326
You bast...

105
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:47,400
So does my complexion look at all unhealthy to you?

106
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,000
Does my face seem unusually pale?

107
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:55,895
Do I look a bit sickly?

108
00:07:56,963 --> 00:07:59,774
Does it appear I'm not long for this world?

109
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:02,529
Do you fear for my life?

110
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,945
You couldn't possibly be more wrong.

111
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:12,930
I'm very much alive and not far from perfection.

112
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:28,905
What do you think would happen if I
gave you a constant stream of my blood?

113
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:41,240
The human body is unable to
withstand such a rapid transformation.

114
00:08:45,982 --> 00:08:48,272
And its cells are destroyed.

115
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:11,539
There's a demon slayer who wears hanafuda earrings.

116
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:13,761
I want you to bring me his head.

117
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:16,278
Got that?

118
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:17,826
Yes.

119
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:19,293
As you wish.

120
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:33,137
Hanafuda earrings.

121
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,257
As you would listen to me,

122
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,017
all right?!

123
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:51,393
It has nothing to do with money!

124
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,320
That's not the problem here!

125
00:09:53,481 --> 00:09:58,380
I just can't forgive the fact that you would
walk away from a perfectly good bowl of udon!

126
00:09:58,673 --> 00:09:59,773
I'm so sorry!

127
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,267
Can I please have another one?

128
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,466
To eat?

129
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:03,420
Yes!

130
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,896
You promise?

131
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:05,953
I promise!

132
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,088
All right.

133
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:09,790
What about you? If you're eating udon,

134
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,403
you better take off that bamboo
thingie! What the heck is it, anyway?

135
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:15,165
Now take these chopsticks, all right?!

136
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:19,012
I'd like a bowl of udon!

137
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:20,667
In fact, give me two of 'em!

138
00:10:20,796 --> 00:10:22,061
Uh, okay.

139
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:38,417
Thanks for the great meal!

140
00:10:38,913 --> 00:10:40,286
It was delicious!

141
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,245
I'm glad you liked it!

142
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,603
Come back again!

143
00:10:43,857 --> 00:10:44,929
Anytime!

144
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:48,495
I'm so sorry, Nezuko.

145
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:49,832
I left you behind.

146
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:50,874
Eh?

147
00:10:51,546 --> 00:10:53,855
What is it? What's wrong?

148
00:11:01,638 --> 00:11:03,520
Are you out here waiting for us?

149
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:05,880
I'm here on her orders.

150
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:07,910
I'm supposed to bring you back with me.

151
00:11:08,323 --> 00:11:10,371
You know, I could have just tracked your scent.

152
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:13,706
Our hiding place is protected by a concealment spell.

153
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,587
You'd never have found it.

154
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,083
Concealment?

155
00:11:18,116 --> 00:11:19,389
Before we go,

156
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:23,152
did you know that girl is a demon?

157
00:11:23,705 --> 00:11:25,272
And not much to look at.

158
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:30,416
What was that? Did he just...

159
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:32,766
doesn't that mean ugly?

160
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:34,100
But who...

161
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:39,049
Nezuko?!

162
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:41,425
You've gotta be out of your mind!

163
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,983
Who would look at Nezuko and think she's ugly?!

164
00:11:44,076 --> 00:11:47,400
She was the most beautiful girl
in our whole town! You know that?!

165
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:51,148
Let's go.

166
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:51,769
I know!

167
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:52,962
We're already coming!

168
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:54,937
But take back what you said about her!

169
00:11:55,584 --> 00:12:01,247
You just need to get a good look at her somewhere
with better lighting! Come on! Over there! Let's go!

170
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:10,022
I know what it is! It's this stupid muzzle!

171
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:12,043
That's the only explanation.

172
00:12:12,117 --> 00:12:15,954
You just need to behold Nezuko's beauty
when she's not wearing this ugly thing!

173
00:12:16,457 --> 00:12:16,920
Huh?

174
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,690
Hurry it up, while nobody's looking.

175
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:35,479
I could have sworn that street was a dead end.

176
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:36,887
Pay attention!

177
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,830
Now, make sure you don't offend the lady in any way,

178
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:43,875
because I couldn't care less what happens to you.

179
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:46,907
I only brought you here because she insisted. Got it?

180
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,380
Uh, okay, sure.

181
00:12:51,226 --> 00:12:51,954
Come in.

182
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:54,718
I've returned, my lady.

183
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,291
I'm glad you made it.

184
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:03,096
I'm sorry that I left everything for
you to take care of. So how's she doing?

185
00:13:03,536 --> 00:13:05,400
She'll make a full recovery.

186
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,603
But her husband has to be locked up.

187
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,542
He's restrained in the basement.

188
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:17,101
Isn't it difficult treating humans?

189
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:18,682
All of that blood...

190
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:22,917
Is that what you think,

191
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:25,847
she chokes back her own drool when she treats a human?

192
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:28,328
'Cause demons can't control themselves?

193
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:30,821
Sorry.

194
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:33,327
Don't do that.

195
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:35,391
Why would you resort to violence?

196
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:39,974
Did I ever introduce myself?

197
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,693
Apologies. My name is Tamayo,

198
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:44,421
and this is Yushiro.

199
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,663
I hope you two can be friends.

200
00:13:52,315 --> 00:13:53,839
That seems unlikely.

201
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:56,137
It's not all that difficult,

202
00:13:57,397 --> 00:13:58,872
at least, not for me,

203
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:00,605
but it's different for other demons.

204
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:05,369
My body's physiology has gone
through considerable changes,

205
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:08,607
and I've removed Kibutsuji's curse.

206
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,222
What curse?

207
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,735
And what kind of changes?

208
00:14:21,978 --> 00:14:22,899
Come with me.

209
00:14:27,096 --> 00:14:29,520
Hey, Nezuko, that's bad manners.

210
00:14:31,093 --> 00:14:32,353
It's quite all right.

211
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:33,886
Make yourselves at home.

212
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,090
Sorry about that.

213
00:14:36,907 --> 00:14:41,829
As I was saying, I made several adjustments
to our bodies so that we could continue to live

214
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:44,234
without harming any human beings.

215
00:14:44,732 --> 00:14:48,010
We can survive on just a small amount of human blood.

216
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,090
Wait. Blood?

217
00:14:50,004 --> 00:14:51,352
So you're saying...

218
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,164
I understand if you find it distasteful,

219
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:56,787
but I buy it from those in poverty.

220
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,482
I tell them I'll use it for transfusions.

221
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:03,506
But, of course, I never take
enough blood to impair anyone.

222
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:05,687
No wonder.

223
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:10,149
That would explain why neither one of
them has the same scent as a normal demon.

224
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:14,019
Except, they still need human blood.

225
00:15:14,772 --> 00:15:16,969
If that's the case, what about Nezuko?

226
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:20,975
And Yushiro needs even less blood than I do,

227
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:23,932
since I'm the one who turned him into a demon.

228
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:26,189
Huh? You turned him?

229
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,685
But how?

230
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:30,645
How did I do it?

231
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,561
As far as anyone knows, Kibutsuji
is the only one who can create demons,

232
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:37,996
and that's more or less accurate.

233
00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:44,672
It took me over 200 years, and, after
all that, I could only transform Yushiro.

234
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,288
Two...

235
00:15:50,004 --> 00:15:51,712
200 years?

236
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:57,237
It took you 200 years before you could
figure out how to transform just one person?!

237
00:15:57,425 --> 00:15:59,747
How old are you, miss Tamayo?!

238
00:16:00,534 --> 00:16:02,977
You should know better than to ask a lady her age!

239
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,465
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

240
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,836
Yushiro, if you hit that boy
again, I'll make you regret it.

241
00:16:09,191 --> 00:16:09,818
Yes, ma'am!

242
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,613
She's beautiful, even when she's angry.

243
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:16,397
I'm sorry.

244
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,518
I'd like to clarify that further.

245
00:16:19,398 --> 00:16:22,488
Creating more demons is not one of my goals.

246
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:25,400
And I only do so when necessary,

247
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:29,384
the terminally ill or injured,
only when they won't survive.

248
00:16:30,543 --> 00:16:37,222
And, even in those cases, I always ask in
advance if they truly prefer to live on as a demon.

249
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:45,368
Her scent is pure. No sign of deception.

250
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:47,632
I think I can trust her.

251
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:50,513
Miss Tamayo...

252
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:53,719
Once someone becomes a demon,

253
00:16:54,123 --> 00:16:56,160
is there a way to turn them back again?

254
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:12,953
Hmm?

255
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:14,861
You see anything?

256
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:19,864
Yes. I can see their footprints.

257
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:22,692
No question, this is it.

258
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,365
They make a sharp turn right over there...

259
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,817
Three of them, headed that way.

260
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,198
One's carrying some kind of oversized box.

261
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:43,214
I wonder how we should kill them.

262
00:17:45,057 --> 00:17:47,006
I can feel the power.

263
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:51,321
I can feel the blood he gave me coursing through my veins.

264
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:55,871
And of course we're going to
be ruthless when we kill them.

265
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,934
A way to make a demon turn human again?

266
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,165
There is.

267
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:04,412
Please tell me how...

268
00:18:04,437 --> 00:18:07,882
You keep your distance from lady Tamayo!

269
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:10,617
Yushiro.

270
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,545
I'm sorry.

271
00:18:12,652 --> 00:18:14,834
I only threw him. I didn't hit him.

272
00:18:15,282 --> 00:18:16,521
Neither is acceptable.

273
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:17,193
Right!

274
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:19,681
Ah, man, that really smarts.

275
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:22,183
Can you please tell me how?

276
00:18:23,332 --> 00:18:26,526
There's always some kind of medicine or aid,

277
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,441
no matter the wound or ailment.

278
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:32,417
I don't know how to turn a demon back into a human yet,

279
00:18:33,935 --> 00:18:35,355
but there must be a way.

280
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,245
And I promise we are going to find it.

281
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:44,410
We are dedicated to establishing such a treatment.

282
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:48,862
Toward that end, I'd like to
ask you to do something for me.

283
00:18:50,408 --> 00:18:55,751
In order to discover a cure, the first step is
studying the blood of several different demons,

284
00:18:56,366 --> 00:18:58,703
which means I have two favors to ask you.

285
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:03,120
First, I'd like permission to study your sister's blood.

286
00:19:03,713 --> 00:19:05,950
Second, I need more samples.

287
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:10,832
I'd like you to retrieve them from demons
as closely related to Kibutsuji as possible.

288
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:14,702
Nezuko's condition is extremely rare,

289
00:19:15,074 --> 00:19:16,645
perhaps entirely unique.

290
00:19:17,325 --> 00:19:20,243
I understand she was asleep for two straight years.

291
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,227
I believe her body changed during that time.

292
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,713
In most cases,

293
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:31,267
that long without food, neither human flesh
nor even the blood of some kind of animal,

294
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:34,189
any demon would undoubtedly grow violent.

295
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:37,128
Lady Tamayo is as beautiful as ever.

296
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,489
She'll be even more beautiful tomorrow.

297
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,398
However, against all odds,

298
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:45,881
Nezuko is showing none of those signs.

299
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,955
That miracle could be the key to finding a solution.

300
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:51,750
Nezuko.

301
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:01,652
But my second request is not a simple one.

302
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,717
When I say, "demons closely related to Kibutsuji,"

303
00:20:07,303 --> 00:20:11,497
I mean demons with powers such
like those of Kibutsuji himself.

304
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,036
Extracting blood from that kind of demon won't be easy.

305
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:17,456
What do you think?

306
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:21,185
Are these requests acceptable, if not pleasant?

307
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:30,225
If it's really the only way, then I'll do it.

308
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:35,523
Besides, if you research all that
blood and you can create this medicine,

309
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:39,039
then it won't just be Nezuko, will it?

310
00:20:40,308 --> 00:20:42,866
A whole lot of other people will be saved, too.

311
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:44,366
Ah.

312
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:47,870
Yes, they will.

313
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,744
Get down!

314
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:10,462
Did you decide how we'll kill them?

315
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,932
Ruthlessly!

316
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:13,346
Hah! Hah!
