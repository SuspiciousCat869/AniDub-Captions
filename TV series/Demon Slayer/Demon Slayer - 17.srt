1
00:00:03,663 --> 00:00:07,639
The Twelve Kizuki should possess
a high amount of Kibutsuji's blood.

2
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:09,941
If I can extract it,

3
00:00:10,057 --> 00:00:12,787
the medicine that'll help Nezuko will be finished sooner.

4
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:16,939
Inosuke's still back there.

5
00:00:21,307 --> 00:00:23,452
So did you take out that monster?

6
00:00:23,872 --> 00:00:26,116
Hey, are you okay? You're bleeding.

7
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:28,602
I asked you if you defeated that thing or not!

8
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,815
Uh, yeah, I did!

9
00:00:30,183 --> 00:00:32,116
But enough about that. Your wounds...

10
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:35,651
Don't go showering me with your
mushy sensitivity and kindness!

11
00:00:35,985 --> 00:00:37,973
I don't need it. You got that?

12
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:41,591
After all, anything you can do, I can do, too!

13
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:47,128
Before you know it, my head will be...
my head will be even harder than yours.

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,348
Not to mention that...

15
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:51,058
not to mention... not to mention...

16
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:53,233
He's not doing well.

17
00:00:53,974 --> 00:00:56,125
And I couldn't save our other friends, either.

18
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,783
That woman gave off a scent of terror and suffering...

19
00:01:03,637 --> 00:01:06,040
enough to make her yearn for death.

20
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,531
What is it about this mountain, anyway?

21
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,206
A Demon family living here...

22
00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:18,476
As well as one of the Twelve Kizuki?

23
00:01:20,806 --> 00:01:23,784
I didn't think demons gathered together like that.

24
00:01:27,347 --> 00:01:28,171
Ouch!

25
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,161
Ow!

26
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:35,969
Something just pricked me.

27
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:39,204
What the hell? I'm so frustrated.

28
00:01:39,607 --> 00:01:42,478
I can't find Tanjiro or Inosuke anywhere!

29
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:43,751
Where did they go?

30
00:01:44,558 --> 00:01:45,626
Great! Now what?

31
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,623
Something really stinks around here, too! Gross!

32
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,247
I think I'm gonna cry.

33
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:54,986
And the sound of these spiders
running around is so creepy.

34
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:59,296
I'm sure they're just doing their best
to survive, the same as me, but still!

35
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,485
Be quiet! Stop moving around!

36
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,292
what am I even looking at?!

37
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:51,967
Why did that spider have a human face on it?!

38
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:54,703
What is happening right now?! What is happening?!

39
00:03:54,838 --> 00:03:58,632
Please be a dream! Please be a dream!

40
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:01,375
If I wake up right now, I promise to work harder!

41
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:06,574
If I were to wake up in the presence of
my precious Nezuko, then I'll do anything!

42
00:04:06,683 --> 00:04:08,349
I'll do hard manual labor.

43
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:11,392
I'll even plow fields, a whole acre, no, two!

44
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,145
I promise!

45
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,315
Let me wake up from this nightmare!

46
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:33,456
The heck is that?

47
00:04:34,237 --> 00:04:37,473
Are those humans who got turned into spiders?

48
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,860
Is that house floating?

49
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:43,247
I can't quite make it out, but are those threads?

50
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:45,295
And it really stinks!

51
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,848
Talk about pungent!

52
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:49,598
Tanjiro would hate this for sure!

53
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,789
The smell is making my throat hurt!

54
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:55,512
Not just that. It's irritating my eyes, too,

55
00:05:08,512 --> 00:05:10,057
It's huge!

56
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:12,708
Look at the size of that thing!

57
00:05:13,155 --> 00:05:15,720
It's absolutely gigantic!

58
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:24,392
You better not start talking to me!

59
00:05:24,462 --> 00:05:26,240
I don't wanna hear it from you!

60
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:33,629
There's no point in running away!

61
00:05:33,804 --> 00:05:35,638
You've already lost the battle!

62
00:05:35,772 --> 00:05:37,747
I told you not to talk to me!

63
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:39,741
I don't wanna hear it, so stop talking!

64
00:05:39,743 --> 00:05:41,920
Things like you give me the creeps, all right?

65
00:05:42,517 --> 00:05:45,886
So you already know how dire the situation is for you.

66
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,393
What are you talking about?

67
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:49,188
Hah! Take a look at your hands.

68
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:50,595
My hands? Why?

69
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:54,106
What's wrong with my ha...

70
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,545
What's this?

71
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,600
You're poisoned.

72
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:02,250
A spider bit you, didn't it?

73
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:04,832
You're gonna turn into one before long.

74
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:12,727
In half an hour, you'll be my
slave, crawling all over the ground!

75
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,560
Do you understand?

76
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:19,207
Here. I'll use this watch to explain.

77
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,924
By the time this long hand goes around once,

78
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,644
you'll have become one of the spiders.

79
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:27,066
When the hand arrives here...

80
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:29,969
You'll feel tingling and pain in your limbs.

81
00:06:30,062 --> 00:06:33,104
When it's here, you'll feel dizzy and nauseous.

82
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:38,971
Here, your body will painfully
start to shrink, and you'll black out.

83
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,932
And by the time you wake up...

84
00:07:10,711 --> 00:07:11,200
Huh?

85
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:19,594
Running away...

86
00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:21,079
Is useless! I know!

87
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:24,882
But you're crazy if you think
I'm not gonna try and get away!

88
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:29,698
What do you think you're doing?

89
00:07:29,864 --> 00:07:32,148
Shut up! Shut up! Just you shut up!

90
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,508
There's no need to be afraid.

91
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,810
Once the transformation has taken effect,

92
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:38,366
you'll lose your humanity.

93
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,551
Exactly!

94
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:41,768
That's just what I've been dreading about all this!

95
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:43,861
Why can't you get that through your head, huh?!

96
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:46,702
Someone like you wouldn't have
anyone special in their lives!

97
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,270
Maybe some more poison would help

98
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:51,612
so we can speed up the process for you.

99
00:07:55,337 --> 00:07:56,599
No, not that!

100
00:07:56,624 --> 00:07:57,692
Stay away from me!

101
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:59,979
I don't want to turn into one of those things!

102
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,835
Get ahold of yourself!

103
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,962
Stop crying and running away!

104
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:08,252
Doing that isn't going to get you anywhere!

105
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,087
Come down from there!

106
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:12,142
You hear me, Zenitsu?

107
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:13,839
We're going to continue training!

108
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:17,424
If I go through another one of
your training regimens, I'm gonna die!

109
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:19,515
I'm not gonna be able to handle it!

110
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,668
You're not going to die,

111
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:22,710
not from this!

112
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:24,838
Come down from there, you fool!

113
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:26,332
Come on, gramps!

114
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,130
Address me as "master"!

115
00:08:28,362 --> 00:08:30,830
But I wanna call you gramps, 'cause I love you!

116
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:38,398
When the girl I loved made me raise
money so she could run off with another guy,

117
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:40,939
you rescued me from my mountain of debt!

118
00:08:41,382 --> 00:08:44,407
Maybe all you wanted was to be able to train a swordsman,

119
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:47,806
but I want to live up to your expectations, too!

120
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,517
I don't know that I can, though.

121
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:52,134
I feel terrible about the fact that I'm like this.

122
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,253
I really do! Just so you know,

123
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:57,795
I've been skipping out on sleep so that I can train more,

124
00:08:58,006 --> 00:09:00,673
but I have absolutely nothing to show for it!

125
00:09:00,698 --> 00:09:04,237
Why?! Seriously, is there some reason I don't know about?!

126
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:06,087
Calm yourself, Zenitsu!

127
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,978
The potential lies within you!

128
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:09,955
I've had enough of it all!

129
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:15,523
Zenitsu, are you okay?!

130
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:18,986
Getting hit by lighting...

131
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,035
How unlucky can you get?

132
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:25,275
That's when my hair color changed.

133
00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:30,836
I was thankful just to be alive, but even so...

134
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,087
I-I hate myself more than anyone else.

135
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:43,998
I always try to get my act together, but I
just end up running away or cowering in fear.

136
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:45,958
I'm pathetic.

137
00:09:47,715 --> 00:09:51,498
I want to change. I want to be a capable individual.

138
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,117
The fact is...

139
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,996
I'm doing absolutely everything that I can!

140
00:09:57,021 --> 00:10:00,417
But I still have to be turned
into some horrific spider creature?!

141
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:03,059
It can't be! Say it isn't true!

142
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,250
What's up with this guy?

143
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:07,776
He's a strange one.

144
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:13,663
Oh, crap! Don't climb up here!

145
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:16,038
Can't you leave me alone for just a little bit?!

146
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:19,415
This is all too much for me to handle right now!

147
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,882
Eh? Huh?

148
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,536
My hair's falling out already?

149
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,698
Wait. My hair.

150
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:33,450
Hey, he never mentioned that part to me!

151
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:42,627
Huh?

152
00:10:44,196 --> 00:10:46,444
I don't understand this guy at all.

153
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:49,925
Isn't he a Demon slayer who came here to kill our family?

154
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:51,879
But he fainted.

155
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:54,106
How spineless can you get?

156
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:58,692
He's gonna fall on his head and die.

157
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:00,318
What the hell?

158
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:11,170
Thunder breathing technique. First form...

159
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:17,117
Huh?

160
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:21,101
Poison sputum!

161
00:11:28,694 --> 00:11:31,122
Did he just twist his body in midair?

162
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:34,712
With such quick reflexes, I hardly recognize him.

163
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:40,217
thunder breathing. First form...

164
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:42,625
Hey, you guys, go take him down!

165
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:48,632
Thunder breathing, first form...

166
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:57,561
He's been going into that same stance over and over.

167
00:11:59,548 --> 00:12:02,415
Ah, I know why he's doing that.

168
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:06,672
He must only be capable of that one attack.

169
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:10,339
Don't worry about it, Zenitsu.

170
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:12,787
That's good enough progress.

171
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:16,717
Mastering even one is cause for celebration.

172
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,743
If you can only do one thing, hone it to perfection.

173
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:27,688
Work on refining it to its utmost potential.

174
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:32,752
But, gramps, just a little while ago,

175
00:12:32,915 --> 00:12:34,255
you were really angry,

176
00:12:34,723 --> 00:12:37,127
because thunder breathing has six forms,

177
00:12:37,351 --> 00:12:39,586
and all I can manage to do is one.

178
00:12:41,497 --> 00:12:44,225
Do you know what the process of forging a sword is?

179
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:48,160
I don't know.

180
00:12:48,263 --> 00:12:49,788
I wish he'd stop hitting me.

181
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:51,187
I'm gonna cry.

182
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,766
When making a sword, you hammer
and hammer to get rid of impurities

183
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,852
and anything else you don't need.

184
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:01,360
The greater the purity of the blade,

185
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,607
the more durable it becomes.

186
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:08,074
Is that why you keep clobbering me day in and day out?

187
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:11,870
But I'm not made of steel.

188
00:13:12,788 --> 00:13:14,317
I'm living flesh.

189
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:18,794
You're not much of a threat, are you?

190
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:21,434
And you call yourself a Demon slayer?

191
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:25,515
Any minute now, you'll be
rendered immobile by that poison.

192
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:29,186
Zenitsu, perfect it!

193
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,640
It's all right to cry or go off by yourself.

194
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,308
Just don't ever give up.

195
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,447
Believe in yourself.

196
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:41,486
You endured all that hellish training.

197
00:13:41,902 --> 00:13:44,374
You'll be rewarded for that without question.

198
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:47,339
Work to forge yourself like a tempered blade

199
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:50,358
and become the most resilient of all!

200
00:13:51,953 --> 00:13:53,987
Focus on what you do best!

201
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:02,775
Get out of here.

202
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,335
Huh?

203
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,094
You gonna make me repeat myself?

204
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,324
Leave my sight.

205
00:14:12,788 --> 00:14:13,967
You know why.

206
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,257
The way you cry like a baby all day long,

207
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,982
aren't you ashamed of yourself?

208
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:23,449
Good for nothing.

209
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:26,995
Any effort spent on you is an absolute waste of time.

210
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,685
Our teacher is an extraordinary man.

211
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,332
But gramps told me that...

212
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:34,557
Hey, you,

213
00:14:34,677 --> 00:14:37,419
don't go being all familiar and calling him "gramps"!

214
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:42,704
He's a former Hashira, someone who earned
the highest title in the Demon slayer corps!

215
00:14:44,372 --> 00:14:48,013
Hardly anyone ever gets the chance
to be trained by a former Hashira.

216
00:14:48,427 --> 00:14:51,291
The time he spends training you is all for nothing.

217
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,058
It's infuriating to see!

218
00:14:53,104 --> 00:14:55,513
I hate even looking at you, so get out!

219
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,050
Why are you even here?

220
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:00,283
Why do you insist on clinging on like a patch of mold?!

221
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:12,312
I have no parents,

222
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:14,112
no one who has hopes for me,

223
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:18,524
no one with dreams that eventually, one day,

224
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:21,392
I'll be able to accomplish something important...

225
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:26,970
Not even a thing as simple as
proving myself useful to someone,

226
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:29,898
either by protecting them or making them happy,

227
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:31,985
just once in my life.

228
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:34,930
I have no one like that.

229
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:38,898
If you mess up or cry or run away even once,

230
00:15:39,094 --> 00:15:42,767
everyone says, "oh, this guy's no good," and walk away.

231
00:15:45,048 --> 00:15:46,635
Or so I thought.

232
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:54,287
Time and time again, gramps would run me through my paces.

233
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:59,256
I tried running away on numerous occasions.

234
00:16:00,684 --> 00:16:02,619
But each time I did...

235
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:05,116
He'd drag me right back.

236
00:16:08,178 --> 00:16:11,081
He smacked me around a little too much for my liking,

237
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,428
but he never abandoned me.

238
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:19,830
Get him! Inject more poison into his veins!

239
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,099
That should do it.

240
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:39,249
Eh?

241
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:41,201
What's this?

242
00:16:41,395 --> 00:16:43,317
The air is vibrating.

243
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,648
Thunder breathing. First form,

244
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,296
thunderclap and flash!

245
00:16:53,908 --> 00:16:55,026
Sixfold!

246
00:17:01,148 --> 00:17:02,531
He vanished?

247
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:25,409
Did I get slashed? Me?

248
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:27,004
It can't be!

249
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,557
To think, by someone like him.

250
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:40,415
This is ridiculous!

251
00:17:40,455 --> 00:17:43,712
I was defeated by someone who
could hardly move their limbs!

252
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,395
I just wanna dream

253
00:17:56,562 --> 00:17:59,125
a happy, peaceful dream.

254
00:17:59,985 --> 00:18:02,795
In it, I'm more powerful than anyone.

255
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,530
I'm able to help the weak,

256
00:18:05,683 --> 00:18:08,165
anyone in trouble anytime...

257
00:18:10,613 --> 00:18:12,474
And everything that gramps taught me,

258
00:18:12,914 --> 00:18:15,365
all the time and effort he spent,

259
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:17,053
it wasn't for nothing.

260
00:18:17,953 --> 00:18:20,703
In this dream, thanks to gramps,

261
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:24,544
I became strong and was able to help a lot of people.

262
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:29,707
But the time for dreams is over now.

263
00:18:35,436 --> 00:18:37,875
Is that you, Chuntaro?

264
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:42,510
I'm so sorry.

265
00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:54,660
Don't ever give up!

266
00:19:04,892 --> 00:19:06,898
"don't ever give up."

267
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:11,333
I can use the breathing technique to slow down the poison.

268
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:13,697
Even if it's painful,

269
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,851
even if it's agonizing,

270
00:19:16,268 --> 00:19:19,008
don't try to take the easy way out,

271
00:19:19,415 --> 00:19:21,267
or gramps will let you have it.

272
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:26,137
Yeah, and Tanjiro's gonna yell at you, too.

273
00:19:29,978 --> 00:19:31,343
What was that sound?

274
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,088
Did lightning just strike?

275
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:34,548
How should I know?

276
00:19:35,402 --> 00:19:37,717
Well, I'm not smelling any thunderclouds,

277
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:41,286
but that odor got stronger and
is messing with my senses again.

278
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:42,972
Inosuke!

279
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:44,178
What?

280
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:47,735
I think I'm gonna go take that path instead.

281
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,968
Why are you telling me? Do whatever you want!

282
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:53,270
So are you headed back down?

283
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:55,946
Back down?

284
00:19:56,473 --> 00:19:57,798
Down the mountain, I mean.

285
00:19:58,035 --> 00:20:00,200
Why would I do that? Just beat it!

286
00:20:00,587 --> 00:20:02,780
What about all your wounds, though?

287
00:20:03,082 --> 00:20:04,580
What are you talking about?!

288
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,010
I'm not hurt at all!

289
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,587
What?

290
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,648
You've gotta be kidding, Inosuke.

291
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:14,592
Anyone from a mile away could see how bloodied you are.

292
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:15,353
Eh?

293
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:15,932
Huh?

294
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:20,621
A Demon!

295
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,171
The scent hanging over this mountain

296
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:25,064
blocked me from picking that up!

297
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:29,062
Listen up, you damn Demon!

298
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:31,365
I'm gonna tear you to shreds!

299
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,381
Get back here!

300
00:20:33,655 --> 00:20:34,535
Hang on!

301
00:20:36,577 --> 00:20:37,717
Now, father!

302
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:39,370
Who are you callin' "father"?

303
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:42,442
Inosuke!

304
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:57,472
Don't you come near my family!

305
00:20:57,532 --> 00:21:00,560
Stay away from them!

306
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:04,732
I'm leaving the rest to you...

307
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:05,832
Father.

308
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:12,457
Water breathing. Second form,

309
00:21:13,036 --> 00:21:14,870
water wheel!
