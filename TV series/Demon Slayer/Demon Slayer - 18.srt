1
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:12,317
Were you acquainted with any of these demon slayers?

2
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:16,942
There don't seem to be any
survivors in this area, at least.

3
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:25,040
We were informed that several of the newer mizunoto
had joined the battle to combat these demons, but...

4
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,592
They might all be dead by now, don't you think?

5
00:00:29,943 --> 00:00:30,625
Let's go.

6
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:34,810
Isn't the moon lovely?

7
00:00:37,284 --> 00:00:39,356
Since we've been given this joint mission,

8
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:41,456
let's try to get along, Tomioka.

9
00:00:42,693 --> 00:00:44,915
My only concern is slaying demons.

10
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:46,827
How coldhearted of you.

11
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:51,417
Well, how about we split up from this point?

12
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,661
I shall proceed from the west.

13
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,199
Very well.

14
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:04,609
Huh?

15
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:07,972
Don't you come near my family!

16
00:01:07,997 --> 00:01:10,834
Stay away from them!

17
00:01:13,786 --> 00:01:16,107
Water breathing. Second form,

18
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,681
water wheel!

19
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,780
It's no good.

20
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,466
It won't cut through.

21
00:03:19,852 --> 00:03:23,214
Its body is so tough!

22
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:31,480
None of my techniques worked.

23
00:03:31,956 --> 00:03:33,953
This is bad. What do I do?

24
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,875
I'll say it again so you understand.

25
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:41,325
Stay away from my family!

26
00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:48,971
Hey, you! Eyes over here!

27
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,213
All nine of 'em!

28
00:03:57,286 --> 00:03:58,775
Raah!

29
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:00,135
Damn it!

30
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,056
All that force with just a single swipe of its arm!

31
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:06,524
I can't beat him in my condition.

32
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:09,883
All this blood loss is making me dizzy.

33
00:04:13,906 --> 00:04:14,852
Damn it!

34
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:21,380
Water breathing. Second form, improved,

35
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:23,688
lateral water wheel!

36
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:45,807
What happened?

37
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:47,753
What's going on here?

38
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:49,428
Inosuke! You all right?

39
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:50,928
Huh?

40
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:54,185
Wait. He did that?

41
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:57,042
What a little showoff.

42
00:05:04,443 --> 00:05:07,603
Okay. I should be able to cut off its head now.

43
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:09,942
Water breathing,

44
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,610
the final and most powerful form!

45
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,129
He's got a different air about him now.

46
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:24,340
I can tell he's about to do
something that's totally incredible.

47
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:27,712
Now I'll finish him off!

48
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:32,177
Total concentration.

49
00:05:32,552 --> 00:05:33,591
Water breathing.

50
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:35,864
Tenth form...

51
00:05:44,035 --> 00:05:45,349
Hey, look out!

52
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,699
Kentaro!

53
00:05:50,485 --> 00:05:51,807
Inosuke!

54
00:05:52,163 --> 00:05:54,840
You have to hold on 'til I can make it back!

55
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:57,108
That's one of the Twelve Kizuki,

56
00:05:57,472 --> 00:06:00,138
so you can't die here! You hear me?!

57
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:02,505
Promise me that you won't die!

58
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:16,249
Oh, crap!

59
00:06:29,732 --> 00:06:31,315
It's starting to get...

60
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:34,312
Really hard to breathe now.

61
00:06:35,648 --> 00:06:36,914
Not only that,

62
00:06:37,226 --> 00:06:39,357
I don't have any feeling in my...

63
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:42,885
Arms and legs anymore.

64
00:06:56,882 --> 00:07:00,211
Nezuko, I'm sorry.

65
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:09,093
Don't give up.

66
00:07:10,817 --> 00:07:12,016
You hear me?

67
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:15,422
Don't give up!

68
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:20,743
Don't give up!

69
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:46,613
Who is this?

70
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:51,917
Hello there.

71
00:07:52,818 --> 00:07:54,292
Are you all right?

72
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,677
Water breathing. Second form...

73
00:08:05,122 --> 00:08:06,401
Water wheel!

74
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:15,955
Somehow, I stuck that landing.

75
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:22,040
I beg of you, please stop!

76
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:52,847
What are you looking at?

77
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:55,735
This isn't a play, you know.

78
00:08:57,685 --> 00:08:59,602
Wh-what are you doing?

79
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,093
Aren't you two fighting on the same side?

80
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:05,128
"The same side"?

81
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:09,089
Don't go phrasing it in such an infantile manner.

82
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:11,120
The two of us are family.

83
00:09:11,857 --> 00:09:14,352
We are connected by a powerful bond.

84
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:19,937
Regardless of that, this is between me and my sister.

85
00:09:20,817 --> 00:09:25,016
If you insist on interfering, I'll carve you up.

86
00:09:27,326 --> 00:09:28,421
You're wrong.

87
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,736
Family or comrade, as long as
you feel close to one another,

88
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:34,782
that's all that really matters.

89
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:38,245
Saying it's childish if you're not related by blood,

90
00:09:38,831 --> 00:09:40,104
that's not true at all!

91
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:41,832
Not only that,

92
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:44,409
but those who are strongly connected with each other

93
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:46,100
give off the scent of trust.

94
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,261
But all I'm picking up from you two

95
00:09:48,695 --> 00:09:51,309
is the scent of terror, hatred, and revulsion!

96
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:54,246
That's not something you can call a bond!

97
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,110
It's a fake, a forgery!

98
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,483
You little...

99
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:11,462
Well, would you look at that!

100
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:13,643
A demon that's a manageable size.

101
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,043
Even I can deal with a kid.

102
00:10:16,252 --> 00:10:17,653
This is my chance.

103
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,759
Hold on a second, please!

104
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:21,472
Don't move in on my prey!

105
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:24,589
This is how I'll secure my path up the ladder,

106
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:29,005
and with more status, comes more
money in my pockets from on high.

107
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:33,055
Even with most of my unit wiped out, I'll dispose of him,

108
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:38,079
and afterwards I'll descend the mountain
to claim my prize for defeating this demon.

109
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:39,709
Take this!

110
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:41,462
No, wait! Don't do it!

111
00:10:47,764 --> 00:10:49,932
Cut to pieces in an instant.

112
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:51,443
How did he do that?

113
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,573
Now, then, what did you just say?

114
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:01,787
I asked you...

115
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,214
What did you say to me?

116
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:09,818
Look how scary he got.

117
00:11:10,475 --> 00:11:13,322
It feels like the air became ten times heavier.

118
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:19,369
Inosuke, I'm sorry.

119
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,916
I'm gonna need you to hang in there a little longer.

120
00:11:23,646 --> 00:11:26,306
I'll be there as soon as I defeat this demon.

121
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:30,010
I'll come help you, no matter what!

122
00:11:31,076 --> 00:11:33,908
Answer me. What did you mean?

123
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,847
I demand to hear it from you.

124
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:41,364
Come now. Explain it to me.

125
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:44,263
Sure! I'd be happy to.

126
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:47,265
What you have isn't a real bond at all!

127
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:15,221
Not good.

128
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:34,344
Damn it. Hiding away like a woodland creature,

129
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,065
how pathetic is that?

130
00:12:36,418 --> 00:12:39,469
I've gotta find a way to turn things around.

131
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:43,104
How do you cut someone who's swordproof, anyway?

132
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:46,435
What should I do? What can I do?

133
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,924
What's the way for me to get in there and hurt it?

134
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:52,030
Think! Think! Think!

135
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,350
Think...

136
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:56,195
Whoa!

137
00:12:58,258 --> 00:13:00,600
This is bad! This is really bad!

138
00:13:01,273 --> 00:13:03,084
Until... until he gets back,

139
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:05,057
I gotta survive somehow.

140
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:10,924
Why the hell am I thinkin' things like that?!

141
00:13:12,885 --> 00:13:15,182
I don't have time for this!

142
00:13:22,038 --> 00:13:23,370
Damn you.

143
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:29,094
I must have gotten infected by tontaro's germs!

144
00:13:29,294 --> 00:13:32,957
I can't let my guard down again!

145
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:34,525
Using my head?

146
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:36,614
That kind of thing's not like me at all!

147
00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:45,420
All right. I got you.

148
00:13:47,345 --> 00:13:49,407
See? It was as simple as that.

149
00:13:49,515 --> 00:13:51,600
If you can't cut something with a sword,

150
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:54,925
all you gotta do is pound on it with another sword!

151
00:13:54,998 --> 00:13:58,873
And just my luck. I have the tools for the job!

152
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:03,670
I am untouchable!

153
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:07,462
Eh?

154
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:11,227
Are you running away on me?

155
00:14:11,252 --> 00:14:14,287
Hey, you, come back here, damn it!

156
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:28,970
Just so you know,

157
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,228
I'm not going to kill you in a single strike.

158
00:14:32,782 --> 00:14:36,111
Instead, I'll dissect you piece by piece.

159
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:44,281
However, if you take back what you said to me just now,

160
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:46,764
I'll make your death mercifully quick.

161
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:48,280
I refuse!

162
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:50,894
What I said was the unbridled truth!

163
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,562
I won't take it back, not on your life!

164
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:03,473
You're the one who's in the wrong!

165
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:24,755
Damn it. Where the hell did that abomination make off to?

166
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:30,512
It's just a scratch.

167
00:15:30,558 --> 00:15:32,202
This doesn't hurt at all,

168
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:35,783
and if it doesn't hurt, it's not a problem!

169
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:37,763
I've had enough of this.

170
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:40,153
Time to sniff him out for good.

171
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:53,591
So there you are!

172
00:15:53,957 --> 00:15:55,699
You dung-brained buffoon!

173
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,414
How high did you climb?

174
00:15:58,645 --> 00:15:59,825
Bastard.

175
00:15:59,978 --> 00:16:03,568
You're gonna try and force me to use my head again, huh?

176
00:16:03,886 --> 00:16:05,670
I don't think so.

177
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:10,620
What the...

178
00:16:11,486 --> 00:16:12,933
Oh, I get it!

179
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:16,696
He's trembling with fear and
dread at the mere sight of me, huh?

180
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:20,386
Well, it's a bit too late for that!

181
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:27,244
The hell?

182
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:28,299
Now what?

183
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,830
Did... did it just shed its skin?!

184
00:16:46,897 --> 00:16:48,245
Give me a break.

185
00:16:48,414 --> 00:16:50,764
I'm all about getting really strong,

186
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:52,269
but this is too much!

187
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,319
This is looking really bad.

188
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:58,065
I've never felt this much force from an opponent before.

189
00:16:58,391 --> 00:17:01,037
A single strike will pulverize me.

190
00:17:06,186 --> 00:17:09,151
It's hopeless. I can't win.

191
00:17:17,216 --> 00:17:18,468
I'm gonna die.

192
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,750
This is the end.

193
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:24,196
Don't die!

194
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:24,894
Huh?

195
00:17:25,465 --> 00:17:28,106
You have to hold on 'til I can make it back!

196
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:35,092
Always live your lives in a fashion where
you are able to hold your heads up high.

197
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:37,425
I wish you luck in battle.

198
00:17:40,196 --> 00:17:41,651
I won't lose.

199
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:45,012
No way am I gonna lose.

200
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:49,318
I'm Inosuke Hashibira of the demon slayer corps!

201
00:17:49,424 --> 00:17:52,065
Give me the worst you got, you dirtbag!

202
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:56,815
So fast. I can't even see it!

203
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,632
Beast breathing. Fang three,

204
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:09,472
devour!

205
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:12,275
It broke?

206
00:18:17,223 --> 00:18:22,539
Damn it. I should have focused more on
my landing than my breathing technique.

207
00:18:23,314 --> 00:18:27,675
I'll make sure you can never harm my family again!

208
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:30,925
I refuse to die here.

209
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,862
Beast breathing. Fang one.

210
00:18:35,022 --> 00:18:37,805
All right, you brute. Take this!

211
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:42,037
I dug 'em in, but...

212
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:43,923
It's like it doesn't even matter.

213
00:18:45,618 --> 00:18:47,718
This thing isn't even flinching!

214
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:09,223
Forgive me.

215
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,180
Please forgive me, Inosuke.

216
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,465
This way, at least you will have a chance.

217
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,032
Survive!

218
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:38,858
Who...

219
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,287
who are you?

220
00:19:51,838 --> 00:19:53,070
What was that?

221
00:19:55,412 --> 00:19:58,570
Did he actually cut through him?

222
00:19:59,137 --> 00:20:03,334
Who... who could have possibly done such a thing?

223
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:15,548
So quick.

224
00:20:17,327 --> 00:20:19,808
Water breathing. Fourth form...

225
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,774
Striking tide.

226
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:32,338
A-amazing.

227
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:44,803
I've... I've never seen anyone as incredible as this guy.

228
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:57,113
Good. The stench is starting to fade, so now
I'm able to detect the scent of the threads.

229
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:00,205
I can take him on now.

230
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,028
Hmph. He's smarter than I gave him credit for.

231
00:21:05,483 --> 00:21:07,810
He doesn't shrink back in fear.

232
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,031
Not that any of that will matter in the end.

233
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:21,659
Water breathing. First form...

234
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:24,740
Water surface slash!
