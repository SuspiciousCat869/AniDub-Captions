1
00:00:03,126 --> 00:00:05,295
I wonder how we should kill them.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,205
I can feel the power.

3
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:13,397
I can feel the blood he gave me coursing through my veins.

4
00:00:14,525 --> 00:00:18,042
And of course we're going to
be ruthless when we kill them.

5
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:21,317
Get down!

6
00:00:34,254 --> 00:00:36,248
Did you decide how we'll kill them?

7
00:00:36,343 --> 00:00:37,582
Ruthlessly!

8
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:38,922
Hah! Hah!

9
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:46,050
Turns out you were right, Yahaba.

10
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:49,575
This building just materialized out of nowhere.

11
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:55,738
Huh. The handiwork of someone using a
blood demon art that can hide objects.

12
00:02:57,837 --> 00:02:59,035
What is this?

13
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:01,692
We're tracking down a demon slayer.

14
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:03,719
Is he with demons?

15
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:06,997
Isn't this fun?

16
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:10,671
I have to say, Susamaru,

17
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:13,782
your way of doing things is just so immature,

18
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:16,150
utterly careless.

19
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,717
You splattered me.

20
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:20,277
My kimono is covered with dust.

21
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:22,997
Oh, stop whining.

22
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:27,307
Who cares about dust? My temari
just uncovered their hiding place.

23
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:30,592
And now the real fun begins!

24
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:37,914
Stop splattering me!

25
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,141
Stop being so uptight.

26
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:42,377
Your kimono looks just fine to me.

27
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:45,110
And look.

28
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:53,800
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

29
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,988
A temari?

30
00:03:57,332 --> 00:03:59,907
Throwing a temari caused all this damage?

31
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:05,967
That woman, did Kibutsuji send her?

32
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:10,352
Hah!

33
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,195
Lady Tamayo!

34
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:27,953
Yushiro!

35
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:31,061
Damn it!

36
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:33,911
Nezuko, the lady sleeping in the back room,

37
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,002
take her outside, and get her to safety!

38
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,099
It's too dangerous!

39
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:41,269
We have a basement! Take her there!

40
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,429
Good idea.

41
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:43,924
Nezuko.

42
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:50,133
One down. Three to go.

43
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:54,805
Her scent is different than any other demon I've ever met.

44
00:04:55,704 --> 00:04:57,977
It's stronger or thicker.

45
00:04:58,353 --> 00:05:00,535
It feels heavy inside my lungs.

46
00:05:08,885 --> 00:05:13,517
Hmm. There's a demon slayer who wears hanafuda earrings.

47
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:15,457
That would be you, right?

48
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:18,258
They're targeting me?

49
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:22,450
Miss Tamayo, I want you to go find a place to hide!

50
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:24,401
These demons are after me.

51
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:29,412
No, Tanjiro. You need to focus
on the fight. Don't worry about us.

52
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:32,370
We'll be just fine without your protection.

53
00:05:34,903 --> 00:05:36,248
We're demons, too.

54
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,054
All righty.

55
00:05:40,017 --> 00:05:41,931
It's all over for you!

56
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:48,335
It'll only swerve if I dodge it.

57
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,859
The fastest thrusting technique of all ten forms.

58
00:06:01,764 --> 00:06:03,191
Total concentration.

59
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:04,624
Water breathing!

60
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:07,697
Seventh form! Drop ripple...

61
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:09,336
Thrust-curve!

62
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,685
Oh? You think you can soften the
temari's blow by stabbing it like that?

63
00:06:18,973 --> 00:06:20,040
How cute.

64
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:27,049
How does it move around like that?

65
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:31,456
It did the same kind of weird
swerve when it hit Yushiro, too.

66
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:35,713
She doesn't seem to be putting any spin on it, though,

67
00:06:35,898 --> 00:06:36,973
so how?

68
00:06:41,832 --> 00:06:42,582
Yushiro.

69
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:44,672
Yushiro!

70
00:06:59,343 --> 00:07:00,630
Lady Tamayo!

71
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,076
I tried to tell you, didn't I?

72
00:07:03,311 --> 00:07:06,015
I said not to get involved with a demon slayer,

73
00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:07,474
and I was right!

74
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:11,278
My concealment spell is still a work in progress.

75
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:14,246
You should have known that just as well as I do.

76
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,429
I may be able to conceal
buildings and people and their scent,

77
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:21,101
but it's not like I can hide the fact that they exist!

78
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:25,593
The greater our numbers, the more traces we leave,

79
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:28,664
and the greater the odds that Kibutsuji will find us!

80
00:07:30,044 --> 00:07:32,125
Those demons got so close to us,

81
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,535
but there was no scent until they attacked.

82
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:38,058
Was that Yushiro's blood demon art?

83
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:44,888
I hate anyone who gets in the way of the
time I spend alone with you. I despise them!

84
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,993
I loathe them with passion!

85
00:07:48,723 --> 00:07:50,428
It's unforgivable!

86
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:56,044
That one's babbling now.

87
00:07:57,847 --> 00:07:59,179
Who's having fun?

88
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:01,000
I know I sure am.

89
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:05,172
You're about to be killed by one of the Twelve Kizuki.

90
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:07,167
Doesn't that make you feel special?

91
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,749
Twelve Kizuki?

92
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:12,510
They're directly under Kibutsuji.

93
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:22,683
That's a lot of arms.

94
00:08:27,282 --> 00:08:30,505
Now, then, let the games continue

95
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,105
until morning comes,

96
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:34,469
until you're all dead!

97
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,100
If I were to cast my spell right now,

98
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:49,069
it would affect Tanjiro as well,

99
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:52,917
and Yushiro needs time in order to switch to attack mode,

100
00:08:53,782 --> 00:08:55,865
but if this goes on...

101
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,166
It happened again.

102
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:02,951
They change directions, even without hitting anything.

103
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,170
If I cut them in half,

104
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:12,362
it blunts the blow, but they still hit me anyway.

105
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:19,109
two different scents of blood.

106
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:20,824
There are two demons,

107
00:09:21,037 --> 00:09:23,001
and the scent tells me where they are,

108
00:09:23,886 --> 00:09:24,850
but I can't...

109
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:32,172
Miss Tamayo! Yushiro, no!

110
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:34,427
It's no use.

111
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:36,131
I don't have time to protect them!

112
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:38,975
We'll heal ourselves soon enough!

113
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,858
Don't worry about us!

114
00:09:40,883 --> 00:09:42,940
Hey, idiot demon slayer,

115
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:45,730
the arrows will tell you which direction they're going,

116
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:48,027
so dodge the arrows!

117
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:49,273
What arrows?

118
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:51,855
Seriously?

119
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:53,776
You're telling me you can't see them?

120
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,273
I'm lending you my sense of sight!

121
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:59,721
That should at least give you
the chance to kill the temari woman!

122
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:13,697
I see them now.

123
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:16,354
She was using these arrows to control the temari.

124
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:19,516
That explains it!

125
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,425
Thanks a lot, Yushiro!

126
00:10:24,646 --> 00:10:26,774
I can see the arrows! That helps!

127
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:29,319
Then, hurry up, and get rid of her!

128
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:32,647
Nezuko, let's go outside!

129
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:34,908
Take care of the one in the tree!

130
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:45,983
I'm the one you came here for.

131
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:52,541
You are the demon slayer who
wears hanafuda earrings. I knew it.

132
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:56,922
I'm going to take off that
head of yours and bring it to him.

133
00:11:00,681 --> 00:11:02,638
This is so much fun!

134
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,569
Nezuko, hurry up.

135
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:25,525
They're gone!

136
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:29,457
Water breathing.

137
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:32,796
Hyah!

138
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:39,932
Third form! Flowing dance!

139
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:48,449
Miss Tamayo, are these two closely related to Kibutsuji?

140
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,317
Possibly.

141
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,277
That's what I thought.

142
00:11:52,414 --> 00:11:55,012
Looks like we found your first blood samples!

143
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:11,186
Which means I have two favors to ask you.

144
00:12:12,302 --> 00:12:15,730
First, I'd like permission to study your sister's blood.

145
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,250
Second, I need more samples.

146
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,165
I'd like you to retrieve them from demons
as closely related to Kibutsuji as possible.

147
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:28,646
When I say, "demons closely related to Kibutsuji,"

148
00:12:29,286 --> 00:12:33,330
I mean demons with powers such
like those of Kibutsuji himself.

149
00:12:34,265 --> 00:12:37,892
Extracting blood from that kind of demon won't be easy.

150
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:43,559
Third form! Flowing dance!

151
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:48,494
Miss Tamayo,

152
00:12:49,138 --> 00:12:51,972
are these two closely related to Kibutsuji?

153
00:12:52,702 --> 00:12:53,698
Possibly.

154
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,152
You think you'll be able to take blood from us?

155
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:11,451
I'm not really sure what kind of schemes you're up to,

156
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:16,534
but there's no way I'm going to let you do
anything that will displease him whatsoever.

157
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:22,525
If you want blood from the Twelve Kizuki,

158
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,985
then give it a shot.

159
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:25,853
Let's see if you can!

160
00:13:26,637 --> 00:13:27,722
Watch your back!

161
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:29,697
Don't let your guard down!

162
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:32,945
If they really are some of the Twelve Kizuki,

163
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:37,717
don't underestimate them. They're more
powerful than any other demon you've faced before!

164
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:40,032
Right! I understand!

165
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:41,318
Keep my guard up.

166
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:45,403
I'll watch my back, be careful, and breathe.

167
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:47,525
'Kay! Here I go!

168
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,556
Lady Tamayo...

169
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,620
Let's escape while they're all distracted.

170
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:55,558
I'm just kidding!

171
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:05,574
Stop stirring up so much dust.

172
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,450
You're filthy!

173
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:21,982
That didn't take long.

174
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:24,358
She can regenerate so fast.

175
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:28,856
The demons during final selection
were a lot slower than this.

176
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:34,514
He'll be so happy having your head as a trophy.

177
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:43,082
Nezuko!

178
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:49,122
Good! You can both die together!

179
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:56,169
You all right, Nezuko?

180
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:58,530
Hey, demon slayer!

181
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:01,745
We're gonna need you to deal with the arrow guy first!

182
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:04,313
Let the rest of us take care of the temari woman!

183
00:15:04,913 --> 00:15:05,801
Understood!

184
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:09,049
Nezuko, don't push yourself too hard.

185
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:25,298
Go get her.

186
00:15:27,022 --> 00:15:27,914
All right.

187
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:29,861
Time to get those blood samples!

188
00:15:30,143 --> 00:15:35,411
I'll fight any demon I have to if it means the
medicine'll be finished even one minute sooner,

189
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:36,966
and I'll beat them all!

190
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:43,024
Got it! The opening thread!

191
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,401
What a grimy little urchin you are.

192
00:15:47,628 --> 00:15:49,274
Don't come anywhere near me!

193
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:53,132
What the...

194
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:54,532
it snapped!

195
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,180
That hurts!

196
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:14,664
I mean, that really hurts!

197
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,085
Whaah!

198
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:26,840
I need a move.

199
00:16:28,082 --> 00:16:30,339
I've gotta do something to blunt the attack!

200
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:34,117
Eighth form! Waterfall basin!

201
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,197
Where is he?

202
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:07,312
Lady Tamayo is in pain because of you.

203
00:17:07,872 --> 00:17:09,472
I can't forgive that!

204
00:17:10,674 --> 00:17:11,554
Tamayo?

205
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:15,117
Susamaru, can you believe our luck?

206
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:17,809
We found Tamayo, the fugitive.

207
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:20,382
She'll make quite a souvenir.

208
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,269
Yes, she will.

209
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:27,766
Don't!

210
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:29,112
You can't kick them!

211
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:40,774
Honestly,

212
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:43,249
this is really too much fun.

213
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:45,599
Are we playing kickball?

214
00:17:46,738 --> 00:17:51,380
Yahaba, you think four heads
will be enough for us to take home?

215
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:54,325
Too many. We only need two,

216
00:17:54,785 --> 00:17:56,834
demon slayer and the fugitive.

217
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:59,487
We have no use for the others.

218
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,174
Oh, no.

219
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,156
The bleeding isn't stopping.

220
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,873
She recovers slowly.

221
00:18:10,396 --> 00:18:11,550
Take this medicine.

222
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:13,496
It'll help your leg heal faster.

223
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:26,163
What do I do?

224
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,827
I can't lose this fight.

225
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,985
But even if I can see the opening thread,

226
00:18:32,193 --> 00:18:33,785
hitting him won't be easy.

227
00:18:35,442 --> 00:18:38,195
Any move is pointless unless I can hit his opening.

228
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:40,483
I'm gonna need pinpoint precision!

229
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:42,878
If I'm the slightest bit off,

230
00:18:43,211 --> 00:18:45,328
the move's not going to be powerful enough.

231
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,619
But the problem is

232
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,258
his arrows can change the sword's direction.

233
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:54,334
And what's with the eyeballs on his hands?

234
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:56,214
They're really creeping me out!

235
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,377
So weird!

236
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:00,697
Hah.

237
00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:08,137
These things are so fast.

238
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,480
It doesn't look like they'll go away until they hit me,

239
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:14,700
and my sword won't do anything to them.

240
00:19:15,463 --> 00:19:18,980
As soon as the blade touches it,
the arrow carries me away again!

241
00:19:24,983 --> 00:19:26,636
What can I do?

242
00:19:35,648 --> 00:19:38,100
It's all going just how I planned!

243
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,178
I'll be taking that arm!

244
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:55,181
Clever of you to spin the same
direction as the kouketsu arrow.

245
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:56,974
Damn monkey.

246
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:00,920
I can't take a whole lot more of these attacks.

247
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:02,560
I gotta get to him!

248
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,857
Somehow I need to change the direction
of the arrows without touching them!

249
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,527
Time for you to die!

250
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,040
I'll adapt my moves.

251
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:18,692
First, the sixth form to envelop the arrow!

252
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:24,218
Then I'll use the footwork of the third form...

253
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:26,682
And close in on him!

254
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:33,974
Twist! Envelop!

255
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:39,613
Twisting whirlpool! Flowing water!

256
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:47,274
My sword is so heavy.

257
00:20:48,376 --> 00:20:50,147
But I've got this!

258
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:52,724
Second form improved!

259
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,159
Lateral water wheel!
