1
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:08,587
Incredible.

2
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:10,220
Look at 'em go.

3
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:15,514
That's it!

4
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:19,750
You really are fast, Kanao.

5
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,954
Your score is now ten wins and ten loses.

6
00:00:25,602 --> 00:00:27,055
I'm still up for more.

7
00:00:27,387 --> 00:00:28,520
Let's go for a run.

8
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:29,632
Wanna join me?

9
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:32,616
Doing total concentration, constant?

10
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:33,563
Yeah.

11
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:37,656
I gotta keep this up?

12
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,303
Do me next!

13
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:40,485
How's this?

14
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:41,791
That's nothin'!

15
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:43,982
More brawn than brain.

16
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:45,246
Let's go!

17
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,252
Where the hell is this place?

18
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,345
Is this her blood demon art?

19
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:24,926
It looks like the whole space
is distorted around that woman.

20
00:01:45,448 --> 00:01:48,727
Only the lower ranks of the
Twelve Kizuki have been summoned.

21
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:51,052
That's never happened before.

22
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:54,638
Lower five isn't here yet.

23
00:01:56,937 --> 00:01:59,445
It moved! Is this her doing?

24
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,401
what is it with this woman?

25
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,464
Who is she?

26
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:17,452
Lower your heads, and kneel down.

27
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:20,657
Prostrate yourselves.

28
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:28,143
That's Master Muzan's voice.

29
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,494
I didn't recognize him at all!

30
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,419
Even his aura is completely different.

31
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:37,125
His disguise is astounding.

32
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,825
Please forgive us, Master!

33
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,668
Since you've assumed a different form, we...

34
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:44,580
Who gave you permission to speak?

35
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,329
Don't presume your thoughts are of any worth to me.

36
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:52,064
All you are allowed to do is answer my questions.

37
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:56,054
The lower five was killed.

38
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,148
His name was Rui.

39
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:02,457
This is my single question for all of you.

40
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:07,189
Why is it you demons in the
lower ranks are so utterly weak?

41
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:11,395
You shouldn't be satisfied merely
being among the Twelve Kizuki.

42
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:13,396
That is only the start.

43
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:17,376
You must devour more humans, gain more power.

44
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,571
That is the path to becoming useful to me.

45
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,268
For over a century,

46
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:27,489
the upper members of the Twelve
Kizuki have remained unchanged,

47
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:32,243
and it has always been those members
who have disposed of the Hashira.

48
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:36,568
Meanwhile, how many times have you been replaced?

49
00:03:36,902 --> 00:03:38,803
You make it sound so easy,

50
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,040
but the fact is...

51
00:03:40,065 --> 00:03:41,931
"You make it sound so easy,

52
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:43,520
but the fact is..."

53
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:46,425
What? Say it.

54
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:48,585
He can read my mind?

55
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:50,872
This is bad.

56
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:52,529
What is bad?

57
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,832
Finish your thought.

58
00:03:57,443 --> 00:03:59,675
Forgive me, Master Kibutsuji!

59
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:03,882
Please! Please show me mercy!

60
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:07,659
I'm sorry! I'm so very, very sorry!

61
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:15,666
Why is this happening?

62
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:18,523
Am I next?

63
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,794
After all I went through to become a Twelve Kizuki,

64
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:24,072
why? Why this?

65
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:27,119
I thought I was going to do so much more!

66
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:31,056
Are you more afraid of the demon slayers than of me?

67
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:33,271
No!

68
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:37,476
I'm sure every time you run
into a Hashira-level Demon Slayer,

69
00:04:37,706 --> 00:04:39,809
your only thoughts are of escaping.

70
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:41,809
No, I'd never do that!

71
00:04:41,928 --> 00:04:45,437
I would put my own life on the
line in order to fight for you!

72
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,133
You're not contradicting what I just said, are you?

73
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:00,259
It's all hopeless.

74
00:05:01,161 --> 00:05:03,531
Whether we agree or disagree with him,

75
00:05:03,556 --> 00:05:04,815
he's going to kill us.

76
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:08,372
We can't beat him in a fight, either.

77
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:11,338
In that case...

78
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:15,113
I'll run!

79
00:05:21,244 --> 00:05:22,439
What a fool.

80
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,127
I just need to make it out of here somehow.

81
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:27,960
Now that I'm far away...

82
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:36,218
The Twelve Kizuki are better off
consisting of just the upper ranks.

83
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:38,615
I will be dismantling the others.

84
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,932
He got me?

85
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:42,929
How?

86
00:05:43,715 --> 00:05:45,993
Was it that fute player's technique?

87
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,626
No, I didn't hear it make any sounds.

88
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:53,613
I can't regenerate my body. Why?

89
00:06:09,124 --> 00:06:12,205
Do either of you have any last words to share?

90
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:15,698
I can still be of use to you!

91
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:19,781
If you could just give me a little
bit of time, I swear you won't regret it!

92
00:06:19,854 --> 00:06:22,407
Exactly how long are you asking for?

93
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:25,548
How do you intend to be useful to me,

94
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:30,009
and what precisely can you
accomplish with your meager skills?

95
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,144
Your blood!

96
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:38,316
If you could give me a portion of your blood,
I will surely rise to meet your expectations!

97
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,891
I will fight for you stronger than before!

98
00:06:41,115 --> 00:06:45,670
Do you actually believe you're in any
position to order me to give you my blood?

99
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,106
Shameless is an understatement.

100
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,148
You will remember your place.

101
00:06:51,283 --> 00:06:52,976
You misunderstand me!

102
00:06:53,156 --> 00:06:54,279
I only said...

103
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,428
Silence. I misunderstood nothing.

104
00:06:58,048 --> 00:07:00,123
I am never mistaken.

105
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:03,273
I am the one who calls the shots.

106
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,650
My word is absolute.

107
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:10,028
What I say is correct by default.

108
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:12,562
It is not for you to refute.

109
00:07:13,136 --> 00:07:15,951
And yet you try to give me instructions?

110
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:18,476
You deserve to die for that.

111
00:07:25,324 --> 00:07:27,389
Do you have any last words?

112
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:31,171
He'll be next to go.

113
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:35,930
Everything hinges on the Master's mood.

114
00:07:36,503 --> 00:07:38,986
I'll be dead soon myself.

115
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,408
Well, let me see.

116
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:46,953
This is all like a wonderful dream for me.

117
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:52,509
For me to be able to perish
by your very hand in the flesh.

118
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:56,601
And I so enjoyed hearing the other demons's dying breaths.

119
00:07:57,218 --> 00:07:59,744
How truly fortunate am I.

120
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,726
I do so love to see others in
the throes of despair and agony.

121
00:08:05,087 --> 00:08:07,584
It's like a dream come true for me.

122
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:11,523
You have my profound gratitude for saving me for the end.

123
00:08:28,815 --> 00:08:30,215
That's more like it.

124
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:33,079
I'll give you a generous amount of my blood,

125
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:37,080
although you may not be able
to handle its magnitude and die.

126
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,583
If you do manage to acclimate,

127
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,025
you are certain to become stronger.

128
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:45,940
Then you are to make yourself useful...

129
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:49,718
By killing Hashira of the demon slayers.

130
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:55,730
If you are able to kill the Demon
Slayer wearing hanafuda earrings,

131
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:57,858
I will give you even more of my blood.

132
00:09:21,273 --> 00:09:22,260
What's this?

133
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:23,741
I see something.

134
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:28,031
It's pouring into me along with Master Muzan's blood.

135
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:36,598
If I kill a Hashira and this
kid, I can get even more blood.

136
00:09:37,155 --> 00:09:38,965
It's like a dream.

137
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:44,311
It is now morning!

138
00:09:44,358 --> 00:09:45,713
Wake up, everyone!

139
00:09:45,738 --> 00:09:46,906
The hell?

140
00:09:46,973 --> 00:09:49,132
Uh, what's going on?

141
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:52,283
The casualties of the mugen train...

142
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,791
more than 40 are missing as it currently stands.

143
00:09:56,184 --> 00:09:59,198
You are to join Kyojuro Rengoku on-site.

144
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:02,433
Head west at once! Head west at once!

145
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:13,133
For the Mugen Train mission,

146
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:16,124
I've decided to send Tanjiro and the others.

147
00:10:17,308 --> 00:10:21,394
Might I ask what caused you to
recommend him in the first place, Shinobu?

148
00:10:22,382 --> 00:10:26,879
Tanjiro has a pure soul and will
work diligently toward all his goals,

149
00:10:27,285 --> 00:10:30,786
and the potential he showed exceeded my expectations.

150
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,876
And perhaps most importantly of all,

151
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:37,919
he has a clear path in mind in
regards to defeating Kibutsuji.

152
00:10:38,532 --> 00:10:41,647
I am in complete agreement with you on those counts.

153
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:44,076
On another matter,

154
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:48,548
Tanjiro told me that his father had used fire breathing.

155
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:50,055
Ah.

156
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,713
As of now, there's no denying
that he still has quite a way to go,

157
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:59,908
but I think that Rengoku, our flame
Hashira, could give him assistance.

158
00:11:00,956 --> 00:11:01,800
Fair enough.

159
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:05,925
Considering that his sister is not a danger to humans,

160
00:11:06,518 --> 00:11:09,607
as well as the fact he came face to face with Muzan,

161
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,743
these signs may very well point
towards this being Tanjiro's destiny.

162
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:18,707
All right, it's time to go!

163
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,010
Hmm? Someone's coming.

164
00:11:26,597 --> 00:11:29,065
He was really intent on bumping into me.

165
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,644
Wait. This guy...

166
00:11:32,697 --> 00:11:34,786
Was he at final selection?

167
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,219
he bulked up a lot in such a short time...

168
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:44,403
But there's something else...

169
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:45,963
His scent.

170
00:11:46,744 --> 00:11:47,959
It's been awhile!

171
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:49,481
Glad to see you're doing well!

172
00:11:54,483 --> 00:11:55,219
Oh, really?

173
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:56,994
You're heading out now?

174
00:11:57,521 --> 00:12:01,059
It was only for a short time, but
I'm glad we got to spend it together.

175
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:02,807
Good luck out there.

176
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:05,063
You take care now.

177
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,983
Thanks for everything. You looked after us,

178
00:12:07,247 --> 00:12:11,900
even though you were busy yourself,
and now we can get back into battle.

179
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:16,468
No need to thank me.

180
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:19,943
It was by chance I got through final selection,

181
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:24,507
and after that, I was too cowardly
to even step foot into battle.

182
00:12:27,377 --> 00:12:28,879
None of that matters.

183
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:32,730
Because you kindly helped me out, aoi,

184
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,324
you're a part of me now.

185
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,427
All your emotions, I'll carry them into the battlefield.

186
00:12:40,564 --> 00:12:43,434
If I get hurt, I hope you'll look after me again!

187
00:12:51,864 --> 00:12:52,902
There you are!

188
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:55,717
Hey, Kanao!

189
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:57,524
We're heading out now.

190
00:12:58,023 --> 00:12:59,290
Thanks for everything.

191
00:13:02,995 --> 00:13:04,308
Uh...

192
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:06,562
Hmm? What's that?

193
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,392
All I did was follow the teacher's orders,

194
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:22,469
and so there's no need for you to thank me.

195
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:23,675
Farewell.

196
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:26,599
She actually talked to me!

197
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:28,472
What was that you just flipped?

198
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:29,672
Bye for now.

199
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:30,678
Money?

200
00:13:30,831 --> 00:13:32,553
It says "heads" and "tails," huh?

201
00:13:32,781 --> 00:13:33,942
Why did you flip it?

202
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:34,943
Goodbye.

203
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,058
You sure made that thing spin.

204
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:40,875
I flip this to help me decide things that weren't ordered.

205
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,577
Just now, I decided whether to speak to you or not.

206
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:50,212
Don't speak was heads, and do speak
was tails, and tails is what it landed on.

207
00:13:51,436 --> 00:13:52,158
Farewell.

208
00:13:53,518 --> 00:13:55,308
Why don't you choose for yourself?

209
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:57,403
Which do you wanna do?

210
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,649
It doesn't matter.

211
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:03,288
Nothing matters to me, so I can't decide for myself.

212
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:06,758
I don't think there's anything
in this world that doesn't matter.

213
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,754
I guess...

214
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:12,267
The voice in your heart is just really tiny.

215
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:18,357
Following orders is important to an extent, but...

216
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:22,323
Hey, can I borrow that?

217
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:24,437
Uh, sure.

218
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:25,917
Thank you.

219
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:31,234
Okay, we're gonna use this to decide!

220
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:32,909
Decide?

221
00:14:33,301 --> 00:14:36,756
Whether you'll listen to your own heart

222
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:38,864
from this point on!

223
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:43,201
Whoa!

224
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:45,047
I flipped it way too high!

225
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:47,152
Heads! Let's make it heads!

226
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:50,492
If it comes up as heads, you're
going to follow your heart!

227
00:14:53,062 --> 00:14:54,237
Huh? Hey!

228
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:55,825
Where did it go?

229
00:14:58,024 --> 00:14:59,223
Oh, is that it?

230
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:03,963
You see that, Kanao? I got it!

231
00:15:08,048 --> 00:15:08,917
Are you ready?

232
00:15:11,126 --> 00:15:12,476
Which will it be?

233
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:16,081
His back was blocking it, so I
couldn't see which way it fell.

234
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:20,953
It came up as heads!

235
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:22,799
Here you go!

236
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,938
remember...

237
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,993
It's the heart that drives people,

238
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:32,854
so it can grow as strong as you need it to.

239
00:15:35,283 --> 00:15:37,142
All right. See you later!

240
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:41,637
How... how did it come up heads?!

241
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,251
I saw his hand when he flipped it.

242
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,802
I'm sure he didn't cheat, but still...

243
00:15:50,386 --> 00:15:51,819
Just by chance.

244
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:57,134
Although, if it were tails, I was gonna keep
tossing it until it finally came up as heads.

245
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:04,232
Take care of yourself!

246
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:22,129
You can do it! You can do it! You can do it!

247
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:27,317
Great job, everyone!

248
00:16:27,735 --> 00:16:28,557
Here!

249
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:29,705
Ahh.

250
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,605
Thanks, girls.

251
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,095
Don't eat it now.

252
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,883
We hope you all defeat a lot of demons.

253
00:16:35,343 --> 00:16:36,476
We'll do our best.

254
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:38,806
Hey, I told you not to eat it now!

255
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,679
Shut up!

256
00:16:39,704 --> 00:16:41,524
Someone should teach you some manners!

257
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:42,682
Tomioka!

258
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,774
Heading into battle now?

259
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:47,155
Yes, sir.

260
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,623
I hear that you've mastered

261
00:16:49,805 --> 00:16:51,659
total concentration, constant.

262
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:52,672
I have.

263
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,767
You should keep at it.

264
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:56,369
Yes, sir.

265
00:16:57,659 --> 00:16:58,458
Tomioka...

266
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:01,040
About Nezuko...

267
00:17:01,337 --> 00:17:02,654
Thank you very much.

268
00:17:03,705 --> 00:17:05,861
The fact that you put your life on the line,

269
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:07,654
I had no idea.

270
00:17:08,103 --> 00:17:10,021
I don't know how to ever repay you.

271
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:13,972
You can thank me by doing your best work.

272
00:17:14,712 --> 00:17:16,627
Our mission is to kill demons.

273
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:18,766
That is all. Got it?

274
00:17:20,368 --> 00:17:21,072
Got it!

275
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:25,493
Be safe, you guys.

276
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:29,529
Oh, no! Saying goodbye has broken your little hearts.

277
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:31,178
I can stay behind if you like.

278
00:17:31,978 --> 00:17:34,200
Zenitsu, while you're on your journey,

279
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,911
please learn to be considerate
and respectful of girls, okay?

280
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:38,751
Yes.

281
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:40,852
I'm feeling happy.

282
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:44,141
You do feel a little sad that I'm leaving, though, right?

283
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:45,354
We're not sad!

284
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:48,206
All right, everyone!

285
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:50,877
We're heading out now!

286
00:17:56,178 --> 00:17:58,745
Hey, wait a damn minute!

287
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:03,095
Wh-what the...

288
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,859
What the hell is this creature?!

289
00:18:06,276 --> 00:18:07,747
Wait. Could it be?

290
00:18:07,835 --> 00:18:09,369
I've heard of such a being,

291
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:11,414
the Master and ruler of this land!

292
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:14,691
At such an intimidating size,

293
00:18:14,738 --> 00:18:16,251
there's no mistaking it!

294
00:18:16,355 --> 00:18:19,222
It looks like it's asleep, but don't let that fool you!

295
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,873
It's a train. You've never seen one?

296
00:18:21,898 --> 00:18:23,449
Pipe down, or you'll wake it!

297
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,119
I'll lead the charge to take it down!

298
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:27,547
Inosuke, stop!

299
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:28,432
Huh?

300
00:18:28,956 --> 00:18:31,584
This might be the guardian spirit of this land,

301
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:34,044
so we shouldn't be attacking it carelessly.

302
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,659
Uh, I said it's a train.

303
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:38,775
You've never seen one, either?

304
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,115
A vehicle for transportation?

305
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:42,823
Man, you're sheltered.

306
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,610
Huh? A train?

307
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,620
That's what the crow was talking about?

308
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:47,648
Eh?

309
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:48,208
Huh?

310
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,861
What is he doing?

311
00:18:54,776 --> 00:18:57,350
Ready or not, I'm comin' through!

312
00:18:57,485 --> 00:18:59,018
Stop embarrassing us!

313
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:02,590
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

314
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:03,280
Look!

315
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:03,715
Look!

316
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,328
These three have swords!

317
00:19:05,905 --> 00:19:08,058
The police! Call the police!

318
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:10,586
Not good! Not good! Not good!

319
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:11,504
Run for it!

320
00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:16,555
We went through hell 'cause of
you, Inosuke! Say you're sorry!

321
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,979
Oh, yeah?! Explain to me why we had to
run from those guys in the first place?!

322
00:19:21,052 --> 00:19:24,614
'Cause demon slayers aren't
officially recognized by the government,

323
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,790
so we can't just have our swords out in public like that.

324
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,692
If we told them about the demons,

325
00:19:29,717 --> 00:19:32,385
it's not like they would believe us, anyway, you know?

326
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,992
But we're trying hard to help everyone.

327
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:37,427
It's the way things go.

328
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:40,044
For now, let's hide our swords away.

329
00:19:44,252 --> 00:19:46,473
We can see them. Put something on.

330
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:52,062
Oh, no! The train's leaving!

331
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:53,549
Are the police still around?

332
00:19:53,596 --> 00:19:54,849
We have to go, either way!

333
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,601
Hah hah!

334
00:19:56,735 --> 00:19:59,097
Here I come, Master of the land!

335
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,372
What are you doing?!

336
00:20:00,548 --> 00:20:01,856
We should go, too!

337
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:04,451
Hey! You three!

338
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:07,599
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

339
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:09,247
Zenitsu!

340
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,099
This thing's fast!

341
00:20:21,974 --> 00:20:23,035
Hey, Tanjiro...

342
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:23,700
Eh?

343
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:27,494
You sure about bringing Nezuko along?

344
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,023
Wouldn't the safest place for her

345
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:31,728
be back at headquarters?

346
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:36,321
This is fine.

347
00:20:37,434 --> 00:20:40,564
Wherever we go, we will always be together.

348
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,240
We're never going to be apart again.

349
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:05,614
No matter what it takes,

350
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:08,000
your big brother will save you!

351
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,090
Muzan Kibutsuji,

352
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,439
no matter where you go,

353
00:21:13,699 --> 00:21:15,987
I promise you won't escape me!

354
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:17,988
Nezuko's staying with me.

355
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:20,694
Nothing's gonna break us apart.

356
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:23,606
The bond between Nezuko and I...

357
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:26,097
Cannot be severed...

358
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:27,943
Not by anyone!

359
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:33,747
Nezuko...

360
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,574
I swear to you...
