1
00:00:10,579 --> 00:00:19,525
Wake up. I said wake up! You gotta...
Hey, can you even hear me? Come on! Get up!

2
00:00:20,668 --> 00:00:24,064
Are you gonna sleep all day? Wake the hell up, will you?!

3
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,913
I heard he was a Demon Slayer with a demon in tow,
so I was expecting someone with more flair.

4
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,597
But it's just some ordinary-looking kid? Too bad.

5
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:43,201
We must see that this boy is put on trial to be judged.
So it shall be!

6
00:00:46,182 --> 00:00:53,739
To think that he's been protecting his sister, who's now a
demon, what a brave and beautiful display of sibling love!

7
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:57,281
What... who are these people...

8
00:00:57,481 --> 00:01:03,376
Don't open your mouth until you're told! Do you know
who you're in the presence of? These are the Hashira!

9
00:01:07,393 --> 00:01:15,935
The Hashira? What is that? I have no idea.
Who are all these people?

10
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,860
Where even am I?

11
00:01:26,949 --> 00:01:35,627
This is the demon slayers's headquarters. You are
here because you, Tanjiro Kamado, are to be put on trial.

12
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:22,595
Before we begin the trial, why don't you
explain the crime you have been accused of...

13
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,185
There's no need for a trial!

14
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:35,400
Protecting a demon is a clear violation! We can
deal with this on our own! We shall execute them both!

15
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:40,859
In that case, I'll
decapitate them with style.

16
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,277
I'll show you the most dramatic spray
of blood ever! It'll be a spectacle.

17
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:56,706
No way! You'd really kill such an adorable child as him?
Such a thought fills my heart with sorrow.

18
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:04,682
Alas, to see such a pitiful creature as this.
I grieve for him.

19
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:08,182
Perhaps it would have been better if he hadn't been born.

20
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:16,335
Um, what was the shape of that cloud again?
What was it called?

21
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:21,329
Wait. Where's Nezuko?

22
00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:28,626
Hey, you. The Hashira are speaking. What are
you looking at? Your eyes should be over there.

23
00:04:29,257 --> 00:04:33,126
These are the nine highest-ranking swordsmen
in the Demon Slayer Corps.

24
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:35,516
That's the Hashira?

25
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,388
Let's end his misery.

26
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:39,138
Right!

27
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:41,138
And let's do so with flair.

28
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:43,497
Hey!

29
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:52,762
Nezuko! Where did you take her?
Nezuko! Zenitsu! Inosuke! Murata!

30
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:57,732
Never mind this boy. What will we do with Tomioka?

31
00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:07,580
Seeing him standing there
without any restraints is making me feel ill.

32
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:13,078
Based on what Kocho told us,
he's just as guilty of breaking the Corps rules.

33
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,437
How should we make him take responsibility?
What kind of lesson shall we teach him?

34
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:25,891
What do you have to say for yourself, Tomioka?

35
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,241
He's in this situation because of me.

36
00:05:34,138 --> 00:05:39,757
Iguro, you're as sharp tongued as ever, I see.
I love that side of you!

37
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:51,725
Tomioka's all by himself, all stoic-like. What a cutie!

38
00:05:54,072 --> 00:06:01,184
Oh, I think it's fine. He did come here without resisting.
Let's come up with a penalty later.

39
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,756
What I'm more interested in is hearing this boy's story.

40
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:14,722
He's been traveling with a demon alongside him,
despite being a Demon Slayer himself.

41
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:19,099
I wish to hear why
and hear it straight from the boy's mouth.

42
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,230
What he's done is unquestionably
against the Demon Slayer Corps rules.

43
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:27,135
You are aware of that, aren't you?

44
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:37,807
Tanjiro Kamado, why are you traveling
with a demon, as a fellow Demon Slayer?

45
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:41,341
Who cares why?

46
00:06:42,989 --> 00:06:45,645
You can take your time. Just answer the question.

47
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,104
She's my... She's my young...

48
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:05,073
It looks like you need some water.

49
00:07:09,726 --> 00:07:17,402
I can tell you've injured your jaw, so please drink
slowly. I added an anesthetic to the water to help.

50
00:07:25,257 --> 00:07:28,837
Your wounds are still healing,
so you shouldn't push yourself too much.

51
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,847
Are you ready to tell us your story, Tanjiro?

52
00:07:37,053 --> 00:07:44,482
That demon is my little sister! My family was attacked
by a demon while I was gone, and I lost almost everyone!

53
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:52,709
My sister was turned into a demon, but she's
never hurt anyone! She never has and never will!

54
00:07:53,316 --> 00:07:55,894
She'll never harm a human being, no matter what!

55
00:07:56,676 --> 00:08:02,740
Enough. Spare us these absurd ramblings.
If she's family, it's no wonder you're defending her.

56
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:07,703
I can't trust a single word you're spouting.
I don't believe you for a moment.

57
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:11,767
So sad. He's been possessed by a demon.

58
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:16,606
Let us end this child's life
and free him from this cursed existence!

59
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,360
Please listen to me!
I became a swordsman in hopes of finding a cure for her!

60
00:08:22,854 --> 00:08:29,022
It has been two whole years since Nezuko became a demon!
She's never devoured anyone in that time!

61
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:36,652
Your storytelling is lacking any vibrant sparks of color.
"She hasn't devoured anyone, and she's not going to."

62
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:40,188
If you're gonna plead your
case, at least spice it up a bit!

63
00:08:45,552 --> 00:08:47,375
What's that bird called again?

64
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:49,730
Was it...

65
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:51,587
Excuse me.

66
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:54,803
Something about this concerns me.

67
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,282
I find it hard to believe the Master
would have been unaware of this situation.

68
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:05,209
I don't think we should act without his permission.

69
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:13,155
Maybe it's best if we wait until he arrives.

70
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:16,991
My sister! Let my sister fight by my side!

71
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:22,882
I know she can fight as a Demon
Slayer to protect humans, so please...

72
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:27,547
Well, well, what kind of fun do we have brewing here?

73
00:09:30,085 --> 00:09:33,500
Is that the moron who brought a demon along with him?

74
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:42,040
What the hell do you think
you're trying to pull here, exactly?

75
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:47,932
Those new scars
make Shinazugawa look even more handsome!

76
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:53,240
Please, Master Shinazugawa!
I must ask you to put down that box.

77
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:02,830
Wow! Even when she's angry,
Shinobu still looks as cool as ever.

78
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:07,263
Shinazugawa, please don't act out of line.

79
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:09,991
Run that by me again, kid?

80
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,136
"She can fight as a Demon Slayer to protect
humans." Was that it? You know what we call that?

81
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:20,702
Completely impossible, you idiot!

82
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:34,221
Anyone who harms my sister answers to me!
I don't give a damn if you're one of the Hashira!

83
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:41,125
Well, how very nice for you.

84
00:10:43,313 --> 00:10:46,377
Cease this! The Master will be arriving shortly!

85
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:06,565
Pardon me.

86
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,571
Damn you.

87
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:19,203
Tomioka's outburst must have been a distraction,
but that boy still managed to get a blow in.

88
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:26,544
If you can't tell the difference between good
demons and bad ones, then you shouldn't be a Hashira!

89
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:34,191
You no-good, little I'll destroy you!

90
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:40,683
The Master of the mansion has returned.

91
00:11:53,117 --> 00:11:54,774
My beloved children,

92
00:11:58,611 --> 00:12:00,905
I thank you for coming here this day.

93
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,051
The Master of the mansion has returned.

94
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:56,607
Good morning to you all. The weather is
strikingly nice today. Perhaps with a blue sky?

95
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:04,071
Finding ourselves here at the semiannual
gathering with all the same faces, it brings me joy.

96
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:11,549
So this is the Master? He looks wounded. No, sick, maybe.

97
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:19,187
So quick! I couldn't even react! What is he?

98
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:38,817
I am pleased to see you in good health as well, Master.
I fervently pray for your continued good fortune.

99
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:42,379
I thank you, Sanemi.

100
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,282
I wanted to be the one to welcome the Master!

101
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:54,695
If I may, Master, before we start this meeting,

102
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,275
would you kindly enlighten us
about this young swordsman right here,

103
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,746
who it would appear has been accompanied by a demon?

104
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:07,982
He didn't seem to have any social graces before,
but now he's speaking so formally.

105
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:13,739
But of course. I apologize for any confusion.

106
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:18,597
Tanjiro and Nezuko have both been sanctioned.

107
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:24,078
I would appreciate it if you'd all accept this condition.

108
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:35,393
Master, even though it is something you have requested,
I cannot bring myself to do it.

109
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:42,155
I am also opposed to this!
A slayer traveling with a demon is unacceptable!

110
00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:46,824
As for myself, I shall do whatever it is you wish, Master!

111
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:52,452
I'll forget, anyway... so I'm fine either way.

112
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:05,155
I won't trust them. Absolutely not.
First of all, I loathe demons.

113
00:15:06,123 --> 00:15:12,378
Although I respect you with all my heart,
Master, I cannot abide by this! I'm fully against it!

114
00:15:13,185 --> 00:15:19,049
The Corps's mission is to annihilate demons.
I ask that you punish Kamado and Tomioka!

115
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:25,405
The letter.

116
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:27,016
Yes, sir.

117
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:39,684
A former Hashira, Mr. Urokodaki,
sent along to us this letter with a request.

118
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:43,063
I shall read to you an abridged version.

119
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:49,880
"I ask you to allow Tanjiro and
his sister to accompany each other.

120
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:56,337
Because of her resilient mental fortitude"
Nezuko has not lost her human reason.

121
00:15:57,252 --> 00:16:03,530
Even when starved, she has never devoured a human,
and that is true more than two years later.

122
00:16:03,957 --> 00:16:08,201
Although the situation sounds outlandish,
it is in fact reality.

123
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:14,527
In the event that Nezuko does assault
another human being, myself, as well as.

124
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:20,545
"Tanjiro Kamado and Giyu Tomioka,
will atone by committing seppuku."

125
00:16:37,904 --> 00:16:40,532
Who cares how they choose to end their lives?

126
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:47,770
Fire, hanging, it's all the same!
It doesn't guarantee our safety!

127
00:16:48,552 --> 00:16:55,202
Shinazugawa is right! If she kills a human, we can't
turn back the clock. That person will be lost forever!

128
00:16:57,218 --> 00:16:59,083
You do have a point.

129
00:16:59,707 --> 00:17:02,148
So, then... What do you wish, Master?

130
00:17:03,197 --> 00:17:07,856
We can't guarantee that she won't attack humans.
We can't prove it.

131
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:16,348
That said... We also cannot be
certain she will attack humans.

132
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:21,616
Here is what we do know about her for certain.

133
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:28,223
She has been abstinent for over two years, and there
are three people who would vouch for her with their lives.

134
00:17:28,724 --> 00:17:34,617
If this evidence is rejected,
one must offer in turn an even more convincing argument.

135
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:40,122
Are any of you able to do so?

136
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:47,957
Also, there is another thing
I'd like to relay to you, my children.

137
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:52,669
Tanjiro has met Kibutsuji face to face.

138
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:58,523
That's impossible!
Not even a Hashira has ever crossed paths with him!

139
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:05,094
Did you, really? What did he look like?
What are his powers? Where did you see him?

140
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:06,830
Did you fight?

141
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:12,320
What was Kibutsuji doing?!
Did you find his stronghold?! Answer me!

142
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:14,992
Shut up! I asked him first!

143
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:17,757
Come on. Tell us what powers Kibutsuji has!

144
00:18:26,949 --> 00:18:31,607
Speaking of that man,
we know he has sent pursuers after Tanjiro.

145
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,407
While his goal may simply be to silence Tanjiro,

146
00:18:36,018 --> 00:18:40,589
now that he has finally revealed himself,
I wish to seize on this opportunity.

147
00:18:41,884 --> 00:18:46,892
I also believe something is happening to Nezuko
that Kibutsuji never saw coming.

148
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:52,575
Do you agree with me now?

149
00:18:56,725 --> 00:18:58,770
I'm afraid I don't, Master.

150
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:04,419
If it were human, there would be no question
we'd spare it, but after all we've gone through,

151
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:11,075
after losing countless of our brethren,
asking us to house a demon, it's unacceptable.

152
00:19:20,112 --> 00:19:25,449
Wh-what is he doing? What is he doing?
Not all over the garden!

153
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:31,997
Hear me, Master! The depravity of a
demon, I will prove it to you, here and now!

154
00:19:33,116 --> 00:19:34,111
Sanemi.

155
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:42,534
Hey, demon, it's time for your dinner. Take a bite.

156
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:03,888
No need to hold back. Just show us your true
colors, and then I'll destroy you right here.

157
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:06,227
Get away from her!

158
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:13,316
It's the daytime. No good doing this now.
It'll only show itself in the shadows.

159
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:18,826
Master, please forgive
the discourtesy I am about to commit.

160
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:29,638
Stop it!

161
00:20:32,615 --> 00:20:37,879
Come on out, demon. It's the human blood you love so much!

162
00:20:38,364 --> 00:20:40,926
I can't breathe. I can't move.

163
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:15,796
N-Nezuko.
