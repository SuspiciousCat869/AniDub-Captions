1
00:00:03,513 --> 00:00:04,940
Beast breathing.

2
00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:08,633
Seventh form, spatial awareness.

3
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:27,142
You find them?

4
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,103
Yeah. Follow me that way!

5
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:31,494
I'm sensing a strong presence over there.

6
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,471
You are? Way to go, Inosuke!

7
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:39,363
Why, you...

8
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:42,191
We can't get anywhere with these guys around!

9
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,129
Damn it. Isn't there...

10
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,739
isn't there any way we can get out of this?

11
00:02:41,985 --> 00:02:44,826
Nez...N-N-Nezuko.

12
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,744
Nez... where are you?

13
00:02:49,124 --> 00:02:52,192
N-N-N-Nezuko!

14
00:03:00,503 --> 00:03:02,112
The hell with this crap!

15
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:03,033
That's it!

16
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:05,348
I'm just gonna demolish them all at once!

17
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:06,930
Stop it. You can't!

18
00:03:07,123 --> 00:03:08,858
There must be a way to save them.

19
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:11,835
Listen. We can't hurt these people.

20
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:18,085
M-Murata?

21
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:21,392
Leave these guys to me, and go on ahead, Tanjiro!

22
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:24,271
Big talk from the guy who pissed his pants!

23
00:03:24,296 --> 00:03:27,150
I never did anything of the sort, you stupid boar!

24
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,476
I wasn't even talking to you, so butt out!

25
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,910
I know I wasn't very brave back there,

26
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,892
but I'm still a Demon Slayer!

27
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,907
I'll find a way to hold them off.

28
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,797
I know now I just need to cut the threads

29
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,156
and that their movement patterns are very basic,

30
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,648
so I should be fine.

31
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:48,573
I'll watch out for the spiders, too.

32
00:03:49,073 --> 00:03:53,454
There have to be people who are under even
greater control that are closer to the demon.

33
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:55,009
You have to help them!

34
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:57,177
I got it! Stay strong.

35
00:03:57,844 --> 00:03:59,203
Let's go, Inosuke!

36
00:04:00,212 --> 00:04:02,013
Hey, let go of me, damn it!

37
00:04:02,038 --> 00:04:04,357
I wanna pound that guy's face in first!

38
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,495
Who's he calling "a stupid boar"?

39
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:07,535
Oh, shut up!

40
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,678
Stop messing around, and get out of here!

41
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:12,183
I'm gonna make you see stars when I get back!

42
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,886
Mark my words!

43
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:20,497
damn it! I can't wait to get back and pummel that guy.

44
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:22,276
Stop talking like that!

45
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:25,063
Didn't you hear him call me a "stupid boar," monjiro?

46
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:26,958
My name's Tanjiro!

47
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:29,750
Anyway, are we headed the right way?

48
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:32,293
My senses have never led me astray.

49
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:33,467
Although, I...

50
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,359
What are all these annoying threads?

51
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,949
It must mean we're closing in on the demon.

52
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,473
There's another group here.

53
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:49,778
Stop.

54
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:54,392
Don't come any closer.

55
00:04:55,224 --> 00:04:59,501
You have to go and bring someone here who's a higher rank!

56
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:04,217
It's the only way for certain to
stop the rest of us from being killed!

57
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:06,852
Help us.

58
00:05:08,635 --> 00:05:10,609
I beg you!

59
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:17,234
I wonder if you can defeat them.

60
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,186
The closer that someone is able to get to me,

61
00:05:21,346 --> 00:05:23,554
the stronger these threads of mine become,

62
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:25,911
as do my precious dolls.

63
00:05:27,896 --> 00:05:28,784
Mother...

64
00:05:33,429 --> 00:05:34,889
Can you really win?

65
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:38,472
Rui.

66
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:44,002
Don't you think this is taking too much time?

67
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:52,609
You'd better get to it,

68
00:05:53,142 --> 00:05:55,385
or I'm gonna have to tell father.

69
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,394
No, I can do it!

70
00:05:58,514 --> 00:06:01,519
You don't have to worry! I promise to protect you!

71
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:06,382
So, please, whatever you do,
don't tell your father, not him!

72
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:15,617
Well, then, hurry it up.

73
00:06:32,752 --> 00:06:35,867
Die, all of you! Just die already!

74
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,610
It'll be hell for me if I don't get rid of you!

75
00:06:41,856 --> 00:06:43,382
Run away!

76
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:46,575
So fast!

77
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,741
I'm being controlled, so my movements aren't...

78
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,526
My own!

79
00:06:54,406 --> 00:06:57,363
I was never anywhere near as strong as this!

80
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:12,185
The demon that's controlling her has no
concern for the strain it's putting on her body.

81
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,870
This is cruel.

82
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:23,295
Stubborn imbeciles.

83
00:07:23,628 --> 00:07:25,085
Take this!

84
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:27,040
That sound.

85
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:34,149
Please, end my life.

86
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,555
All the bones...

87
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:39,574
In my arms and legs...

88
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:43,421
They're broken, piercing my insides.

89
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,981
Every time I'm forced to move,

90
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,369
the pain is unbearable.

91
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:52,131
I can't take it anymore.

92
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,699
Either way, I'll die.

93
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:57,096
So, please...

94
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,771
Just hurry up, and finish the job.

95
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:04,885
I'll take on the job.

96
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:05,772
Wait!

97
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:08,346
Inosuke!

98
00:08:08,444 --> 00:08:10,294
We gotta find a way to save him!

99
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:12,167
Oh, shut up!

100
00:08:12,302 --> 00:08:15,293
You need to stop your bellyachin'!

101
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:16,779
Listen to me!

102
00:08:17,032 --> 00:08:20,638
He's asking us to put him out of his misery, all right?

103
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:25,830
These guys are speedy, too.

104
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,262
If we get caught nappin', we'll be done for!

105
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,202
I know that! Just give me a moment to think.

106
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,735
I don't want to attack them,

107
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,655
but cutting the strings won't have a lasting effect.

108
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:38,912
How can we stop them from moving?

109
00:08:40,544 --> 00:08:41,454
I've got it!

110
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,989
Eh? Hey!

111
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,974
Good. She's following me.

112
00:08:51,857 --> 00:08:52,954
The hell?

113
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:55,534
Why are you running around in circles like that?

114
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:57,241
Quit messin' around!

115
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:05,807
total concentration.

116
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:07,943
Huh?

117
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:10,672
So strong.

118
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:19,526
Great! Looks like it worked out!

119
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:24,026
Wha...

120
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,913
What the heck was that just now?!

121
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:29,884
I wanna do it, too!

122
00:09:29,964 --> 00:09:31,663
Come at me!

123
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:46,874
You see that?!

124
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:50,274
Whatever you can do, I can do just as well!

125
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,164
Sorry. I must have missed it.

126
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:54,117
You're kidding!

127
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:56,412
I'm a little busy at the moment!

128
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:07,122
Damn! They are all such useless puppets.

129
00:10:08,215 --> 00:10:11,198
I have no choice but to unleash that one, then.

130
00:10:23,394 --> 00:10:26,501
Nezuko!

131
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:31,798
Nezuko!

132
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,718
Where are you?!

133
00:10:36,794 --> 00:10:38,260
Nezuko,

134
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:39,632
Tanjiro,

135
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,105
Chuntaro, even the wild boar,

136
00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:45,322
where did you all go?!

137
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,532
I'm sorry for everything, okay?

138
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,413
Chuntaro?

139
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,584
You decided to come check in on me?

140
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:03,592
You're so wonderful and adorable, Chuntaro!

141
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:05,950
Not as adorable as Nezuko, but I'd say a close second!

142
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:08,111
I really appreciate this!

143
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:10,963
I'm sorry for everything!

144
00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:14,040
How about we just start fresh
and go look for Nezuko together?

145
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:20,296
Check that out!

146
00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:23,100
I've tossed up more of 'em than you have now!

147
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:24,715
That's good. Just one more.

148
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:28,555
Okay. I'm gonna do it one more time, so watch!

149
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,493
All right, fine. I'll watch.

150
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,240
Just try not to hurt him!

151
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:34,245
These puppets are weak!

152
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:35,820
I don't need them anymore!

153
00:11:36,247 --> 00:11:37,333
They're useless!

154
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,062
Damn it to hell.

155
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:52,875
That thing went and killed all of 'em!

156
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:17,105
Let's go.

157
00:12:18,382 --> 00:12:19,942
No arguments here.

158
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:25,827
it's this way!

159
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:27,724
We'll reach them before you know it.

160
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:30,461
Now that the wind's changed direction,

161
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:32,195
my sense of smell is returning.

162
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:34,529
Then I'll know exactly where it is.

163
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,525
There! I'm picking up two more scents!

164
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,437
Inosuke!

165
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:43,566
I detected that thing before you did.

166
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,961
I'm gonna hack its head right off its shoulders!

167
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:52,155
Huh?

168
00:12:55,353 --> 00:12:56,387
That thing...

169
00:12:56,668 --> 00:12:59,329
Doesn't even have a head!

170
00:13:01,517 --> 00:13:03,296
Nezuko!

171
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:05,407
Where are you?!

172
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,286
Where the heck are you, Tanjiro?

173
00:13:15,553 --> 00:13:21,044
You, too, Inosuke. Don't just leave me
here all by myself in this terrifying forest!

174
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:31,174
What was that?

175
00:13:33,132 --> 00:13:34,132
You know what?

176
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:36,855
This is starting to make me really mad.

177
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:40,574
I'm gonna find Nezuko and then
say goodbye to this creepy forest.

178
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:45,140
Nezuko!

179
00:13:57,883 --> 00:13:59,746
This thing's got no weak spots.

180
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:01,175
Where am I supposed to cut it?

181
00:14:02,763 --> 00:14:03,725
Inosuke.

182
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,825
What do we do? What do we do?!

183
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:08,404
Calm down. Listen closely, all right?

184
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:12,005
Slash from the right part of the
neck to the left part of its waist.

185
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:14,173
It'll be tough.

186
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:16,990
It's a lot of mass to cover. That said...

187
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:19,900
No, wait! Don't go alone!

188
00:14:20,164 --> 00:14:21,153
It's fast.

189
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:28,231
I can still dodge it, though!

190
00:14:29,427 --> 00:14:30,579
That's right!

191
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:31,525
Those spiders!

192
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:35,608
I can't move.

193
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:39,061
I'm a dead man!

194
00:14:52,595 --> 00:14:54,843
Inosuke, this is a tough one,

195
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:56,325
but we can do it.

196
00:14:56,705 --> 00:14:58,288
If we put our heads together,

197
00:14:58,723 --> 00:15:00,062
we'll be able to win!

198
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,062
Damn you!

199
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,831
Don't go making me feel giddier than I already do!

200
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:10,156
This thing's in my way!

201
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,048
Here! Launch yourself!

202
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,763
Now jump! Go for it!

203
00:15:34,335 --> 00:15:37,250
Total concentration. Water breathing.

204
00:15:38,162 --> 00:15:39,195
Fourth form...

205
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,489
Striking tide!

206
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:50,891
You're up, Inosuke!

207
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:53,823
It seems like he's got everything figured out.

208
00:15:54,012 --> 00:15:56,800
I gotta say that's pretty irritating.

209
00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:59,996
It's almost like he can predict the future.

210
00:16:00,996 --> 00:16:04,662
It's as natural for him as water flowing from a river.

211
00:16:04,942 --> 00:16:07,963
It's not about going first for this kid.

212
00:16:08,683 --> 00:16:10,954
It's all about the battle itself

213
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:15,319
and watching it flow like a raging current!

214
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:37,479
Great! He cut it perfectly.

215
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:40,576
All right, Inosuke! You defeated it!

216
00:16:44,762 --> 00:16:46,858
Hmm? What's wrong?

217
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:56,495
I'll prove to that idiot
anything he can do, I can do, too!

218
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:09,615
A scent?

219
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:12,385
So that's why you did that, Inosuke!

220
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:14,233
No.

221
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:18,667
That doll was my fastest and
strongest, and they still won!

222
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,139
It's Rui's fault for coming to me with his threats!

223
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,746
That's why I panicked.

224
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:26,627
It's not my fault.

225
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:32,214
From above?

226
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:36,271
Water breathing! First form...

227
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,986
He's going to cut my head off!

228
00:17:39,156 --> 00:17:41,642
Oh, what do I do? What do I do?!

229
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:46,755
a-although...

230
00:17:48,472 --> 00:17:50,978
If I die, I'll be freed.

231
00:17:56,281 --> 00:17:57,842
I'll find peace.

232
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,239
Fifth form,

233
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,302
blessed rain after the drought.

234
00:18:15,332 --> 00:18:16,557
This feeling,

235
00:18:17,992 --> 00:18:21,293
it's like I'm being showered by a gentle rain.

236
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,981
It doesn't hurt, not at all.

237
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:31,261
I just feel warm.

238
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:37,855
I never dreamed my end would be this tranquil.

239
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:44,080
And now I'll be released.

240
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,222
I'm sorry!

241
00:18:57,442 --> 00:19:00,026
I didn't mean to make you so angry!

242
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:04,956
Tell me, what was it that infuriated you?

243
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,795
It's your own fault for not realizing what made him angry.

244
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:16,781
But how could I?

245
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:22,406
Looks like mother's in trouble with father again.

246
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:33,429
No! Stop! No more!

247
00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:49,807
Those eyes.

248
00:19:52,503 --> 00:19:54,664
Such kind eyes.

249
00:19:57,111 --> 00:20:03,827
When I was human, I think there was someone
who used to look at me with those same kind eyes.

250
00:20:06,543 --> 00:20:08,644
I wonder who that was.

251
00:20:14,557 --> 00:20:16,021
I can't remember.

252
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:22,273
I just know that it was someone who always cherished me.

253
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:26,532
I wonder...

254
00:20:26,978 --> 00:20:29,442
How that person is doing now.

255
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:43,522
Someone from the Twelve Kizuki is here.

256
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:46,740
W-Wait!

257
00:20:49,186 --> 00:20:50,581
Be careful.

258
00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:00,972
A member of the Twelve Kizuki,

259
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:04,087
they're here on this mountain,

260
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:05,867
just within my grasp.
