1
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:18,214
No way. My sword!

2
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:16,422
Incredible.

3
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:18,892
He's on a whole other level.

4
00:02:19,016 --> 00:02:22,460
The force of his strike alone is in a class of its own.

5
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:26,899
He cut through that tough-as-nails
monster like it was tofu!

6
00:02:27,257 --> 00:02:31,026
Amazing. That was absolutely amazing!

7
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:33,610
Who even is this guy?

8
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:35,773
I still have goose bumps!

9
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:46,566
Hold on a second!

10
00:02:46,697 --> 00:02:49,108
Fight me, Mr. Mismatched outfit!

11
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,762
You beat that member of the Twelve Kizuki,

12
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,023
and now, right here, I'm gonna beat you!

13
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,577
If I can manage that...

14
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:01,147
That'll make me the most powerful of all!

15
00:03:01,655 --> 00:03:03,061
I have a better idea.

16
00:03:03,306 --> 00:03:04,439
Go train more.

17
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,102
What'd you say to me?!

18
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,550
That wasn't one of the Twelve Kizuki.

19
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:13,674
Could you not even tell that?

20
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,888
Of course I could tell! For your information,

21
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:19,228
it was Tanjiro who was saying it was one of 'em!

22
00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:21,858
I was just repeating what he said to me earlier.

23
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:25,781
I knew that amateur couldn't have been one of those guys!

24
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,226
What the hell?

25
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,557
When did he tie me up?

26
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:34,376
I see it's not just a sword he's quick with.

27
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,782
Hey, you, get back here!

28
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:40,108
If you are not aware of what state your body is in,

29
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,600
you shouldn't be fighting.

30
00:03:41,752 --> 00:03:43,471
Huh?! I can't hear you!

31
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:46,208
Your voice is too soft, and you're walking too fast!

32
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,009
I said hold your horses!

33
00:03:48,202 --> 00:03:50,145
Untie these ropes right now!

34
00:03:50,174 --> 00:03:55,780
Get me down!

35
00:04:12,215 --> 00:04:13,968
I said hello there!

36
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:15,759
You can hear me, can't you?

37
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:19,607
Thanks, gramps.

38
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:22,989
Are you calling me gramps?

39
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:29,670
Just now, gramps showed up
and told me not to give up ever.

40
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:32,691
Ah! Your life flashed before your eyes.

41
00:04:32,876 --> 00:04:34,810
You know, according to one theory,

42
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:40,337
the reason you see images like that just before
death is because you're searching for a way to avoid death

43
00:04:40,403 --> 00:04:43,662
by going through all your past experiences and memories.

44
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,354
Truthfully, I can't speak from
experience, as it's never happened to me.

45
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:56,195
Good. I can tell you slowed the
poison by adjusting your breathing.

46
00:04:56,655 --> 00:04:58,523
If you weren't able to do that,

47
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,702
you would have already turned into a spider.

48
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:03,237
I'll inject you with the antidote now.

49
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:08,395
Hurry! This way! Over here!

50
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:11,523
Can we get them down?

51
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,875
Be careful with them.

52
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:15,474
Good. They're all still alive!

53
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:33,848
My sword's been broken.

54
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:35,838
I can't believe it!

55
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:42,150
Are those threads he's controlling even tougher
than that demon whose body I couldn't cut through?

56
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:44,864
Urokodaki...

57
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:47,608
Haganezuka, forgive me.

58
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:51,703
Thanks to my inexperience, my sword is now shattered.

59
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:56,938
Now's not the time to feel sorry for yourself.

60
00:05:57,074 --> 00:05:58,510
Now's the time to think!

61
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,915
If I can't cut those threads,

62
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:03,752
then I'll just have to meet him head-on!

63
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:12,197
It's like those threads have a life of their own

64
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:14,350
and are refusing to let me get close.

65
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:17,408
Even though he's holding back so as not to kill me,

66
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,706
he's overpowering me all the same!

67
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:22,561
What now?

68
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:26,364
Do you still refuse to take back what you said earlier?

69
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:31,553
You refuse? Fine.

70
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:33,441
I'll put an end to you now.

71
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,212
I can't dodge this!

72
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,429
Nezuko!

73
00:06:52,694 --> 00:06:54,121
Nezuko, hang in there.

74
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:57,045
You protected me. Thank you.

75
00:06:57,893 --> 00:07:01,062
The girl emerged from that box and defended him.

76
00:07:01,397 --> 00:07:03,598
But I'm sure she's one of us.

77
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:09,626
That girl...

78
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:11,254
Is she...

79
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:13,547
Is...

80
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:16,483
is she your sibling?

81
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,459
And so what if she is?

82
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:20,705
The cut is so deep,

83
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:23,313
her left wrist is about to fall off.

84
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:27,229
Come on! Heal up already!

85
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:28,416
It has to heal!

86
00:07:30,013 --> 00:07:32,312
Siblings. Siblings.

87
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,061
His sister's been turned into a demon,

88
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:36,956
yet she stays by his side.

89
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:41,901
She risked her own life to protect him.

90
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:45,586
That is a genuine bond, and it'll be mine!

91
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:48,450
Rui! Hold on a second!

92
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:50,378
Please reconsider!

93
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:52,231
I'm your elder sister!

94
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:53,833
You can't abandon me!

95
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:54,912
Shut up!

96
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:10,519
None of you were ever able to
fulfill the roles you were assigned,

97
00:08:11,238 --> 00:08:13,423
not once in your entire life.

98
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:16,204
Wait. Brother,

99
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:19,008
wasn't I the elder sister that you wanted?

100
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:21,069
Give me another chance.

101
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:22,931
Very well, then.

102
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:26,263
Go kill the humans wandering all over this mountain.

103
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:30,806
If you do that, I'll forgive you for what just happened.

104
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:33,183
A-all right.

105
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,990
Yes, I'll do that.

106
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:42,070
Boy...

107
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:45,930
Let's talk, just the two of us.

108
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:47,164
Come on out.

109
00:08:49,256 --> 00:08:51,309
Why is he being so friendly?

110
00:08:53,138 --> 00:08:55,917
The truth is, what your sister did,

111
00:08:56,823 --> 00:08:59,474
I found it genuinely moving to behold.

112
00:09:00,364 --> 00:09:04,190
I doubt any words exist that describe exactly how I felt.

113
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,535
However, your fate now is death,

114
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:11,283
a disagreeable conclusion for you, no doubt.

115
00:09:14,918 --> 00:09:16,362
So listen close.

116
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,221
I'll impart to you how you can escape your fate.

117
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:23,131
It involves your sister.

118
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:26,312
I want you to give her to me.

119
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:30,991
If you do so, then I will spare your life.

120
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:36,229
I have no idea what you're talking about.

121
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:40,328
As of today, instead of being your little sister,

122
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:41,740
she's mine.

123
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:46,028
You don't actually think I'd ever agree to that, do you?

124
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:48,606
First off, Nezuko's not a thing!

125
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,122
She has her own will and feelings!

126
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,317
There's no way she'll ever be your sister!

127
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:56,863
It's all right.

128
00:09:57,003 --> 00:09:58,416
You don't need to worry.

129
00:09:58,903 --> 00:10:00,435
I'm stronger than you.

130
00:10:01,197 --> 00:10:05,051
I will create a bond with her, one made of terror.

131
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:08,190
She'll know what happens when I'm defied.

132
00:10:08,297 --> 00:10:10,659
I've had enough of you spouting this nonsense!

133
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:15,066
Using fear to keep someone shackled
to you isn't the bond of a family,

134
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:18,135
and until you are able to figure that out,

135
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:20,944
you'll never get what it is you desire!

136
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:23,444
So irritating.

137
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:25,772
Would you mind not shouting?

138
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:27,881
It's clear we don't agree.

139
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:35,740
I'll never hand Nezuko over to you!

140
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,231
Very well, then.

141
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:39,983
I'll just kill you.

142
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:42,836
Not if I manage to cut your head off first!

143
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:45,561
Now, that's the spirit.

144
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:48,490
I would love to see you try it.

145
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:52,147
Let's see if you can take down a being like me,

146
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,222
one of the Twelve Kizuki.

147
00:11:04,132 --> 00:11:05,258
In a family,

148
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:13,132
the father has his designated role to
fulfill, and the mother has hers in turn.

149
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:20,651
The parents protect their eldest children,
and the eldest protect the younger ones.

150
00:11:21,318 --> 00:11:23,919
This is carried out, no matter what,

151
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:26,141
even at the risk of their own lives.

152
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:29,085
The way I see it,

153
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:32,199
if you don't understand your own role in this life,

154
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:34,968
there's no reason in living it to begin with.

155
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:40,603
As for you, I'll tell you your role.

156
00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:45,039
It is to relinquish your younger
sister to me and disappear.

157
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:48,705
If you refuse, your only other path is death,

158
00:11:48,964 --> 00:11:50,725
for you cannot defeat me.

159
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:55,266
His eye says "lower five."

160
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,170
As I thought.

161
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,516
This power... he really is one of the twelve.

162
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:04,474
It won't be easy to cut those threads,

163
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:07,524
but what do I do if his neck is even tougher?

164
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:09,719
Not to mention my broken sword.

165
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,103
That steely look in your eyes,

166
00:12:13,356 --> 00:12:14,403
I don't like it.

167
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,346
What are you plotting?

168
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:17,985
Don't tell me...

169
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,242
That you think you'll be able to defeat me!

170
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,361
Nezuko!

171
00:12:27,938 --> 00:12:29,205
It's settled.

172
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,618
I'll be taking her.

173
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:33,219
You understand your role now, don't you?

174
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,070
Let her go!

175
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,688
Did I not I tell you that I'd spare
your life in return for your obedience?

176
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,858
Where'd she go?

177
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,351
Nezuko!

178
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:10,033
Quiet down.

179
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,747
This won't be enough to kill her.

180
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:14,118
She's a demon.

181
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:17,972
But it does appear I'll have to teach her a lesson.

182
00:13:18,408 --> 00:13:20,514
I'm going to let her bleed for a while.

183
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:23,531
If she won't learn to be obedient,

184
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,361
I'll just leave her like that until daybreak

185
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:28,849
and then let her burn.

186
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:30,362
I won't allow it!

187
00:13:30,757 --> 00:13:32,657
Let her go!

188
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:58,285
Now, I may be mistaken here...

189
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,213
But you think, if you get close enough
to me, you can chop my head off, don't you?

190
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:10,161
Well, then, here.

191
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:11,495
Give it a shot.

192
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:22,126
The blade, it won't go through!

193
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,623
Didn't I tell you?

194
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:29,962
You have no chance against me.

195
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,428
My body is more durable than any
of the threads I can manipulate.

196
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:44,376
If you can't even cut those threads,

197
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,731
then you'll never be able to cut my neck.

198
00:14:57,078 --> 00:14:58,727
He's incredibly strong.

199
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,919
His strength is beyond any other demon I've fought so far.

200
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,540
So this is the might of the Twelve Kizuki,

201
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,923
the power of a demon closely related to Kibutsuji.

202
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:18,390
You're noisy.

203
00:15:18,556 --> 00:15:20,198
If you don't quiet down...

204
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:24,608
No! Stop that!

205
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:27,818
As of today, I'm her elder brother,

206
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:30,385
and I command she cease that noise.

207
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,841
calm down. Don't get emotional.

208
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:38,670
If you do, you'll play right into his hands.

209
00:15:42,546 --> 00:15:44,618
Huh? What happened to her?

210
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:47,403
Did she pass out?

211
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:50,638
This demon has a unique aura.

212
00:15:51,065 --> 00:15:53,639
I haven't seen anything quite like it.

213
00:15:54,406 --> 00:15:55,594
Fascinating.

214
00:15:57,014 --> 00:15:58,200
Concentrate.

215
00:15:59,114 --> 00:16:00,575
Control your breathing.

216
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:03,616
Unleash the most precise final form!

217
00:16:04,016 --> 00:16:06,365
Total concentration!

218
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:10,754
Don't you see this is futile?

219
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:18,781
Water breathing! Tenth form...

220
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:21,686
Constant flux!

221
00:16:26,814 --> 00:16:29,142
I did it! I cut the threads!

222
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:32,283
Gathering force with each rotation.

223
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,085
This could be worrisome.

224
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,575
If I can keep closing the distance between us,

225
00:16:38,675 --> 00:16:39,915
I can defeat him!

226
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:47,957
Boy, you don't think these threads
are at maximum strength, do you?

227
00:16:48,783 --> 00:16:49,975
Blood demon art.

228
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,689
Cutting thread cage.

229
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:55,093
I have no more use for you.

230
00:16:55,457 --> 00:16:56,527
Farewell.

231
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,707
Not good.

232
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,865
I can't get enough rotations in to cut away these threads.

233
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:06,293
They're giving off a totally
different scent than the other ones.

234
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,739
This can't be how it ends, can it?

235
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,007
Am I really gonna die here?

236
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,073
Am I?

237
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,998
Father.

238
00:17:43,457 --> 00:17:44,451
Tanjiro...

239
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:46,789
Your breathing.

240
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:49,307
Master your command over it,

241
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:51,569
and then become more like Hinokami.

242
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:02,981
Look, Tanjiro.

243
00:18:03,754 --> 00:18:06,644
That is your father's kagura dance.

244
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,653
Our family works with fire,

245
00:18:10,026 --> 00:18:12,609
so to ward off injuries and disasters,

246
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:17,903
we offer this dance to Hinokami along
with our prayers at the start of each year.

247
00:18:23,643 --> 00:18:25,057
Um, mommy?

248
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:25,737
Hmm?

249
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:29,018
Father's always been pretty sick, right?

250
00:18:29,165 --> 00:18:33,144
So how can he be out in the snow
and still keep dancing and dancing?

251
00:18:34,752 --> 00:18:35,892
If that were me,

252
00:18:36,425 --> 00:18:38,473
I bet my lungs would freeze.

253
00:18:41,268 --> 00:18:43,516
There exists a breathing technique,

254
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:47,092
one that will prevent you from ever exhausting yourself.

255
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,626
Really?

256
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:50,640
Yes.

257
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:53,568
If you can master the correct way to breathe,

258
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,112
you'll be able to dance forever, too.

259
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:59,087
Even the cold won't bother you.

260
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,640
Tanjiro...

261
00:19:02,606 --> 00:19:05,603
This ceremonial dance and pair of earrings,

262
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:08,966
I wish for them to be passed down to you.

263
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:11,941
This is my gift.

264
00:19:17,826 --> 00:19:19,443
Hinokami Kagura...

265
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:23,671
Dance!

266
00:19:24,624 --> 00:19:25,499
My threads.

267
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:32,993
Don't stop. Keep running!

268
00:19:33,716 --> 00:19:37,627
If you hesitate and switch between
different breathing techniques,

269
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:39,588
there'll be repercussions!

270
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:43,465
If that happens, I'll be rendered immobile for a time!

271
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:48,001
That's why I need to keep pressing on!

272
00:19:48,741 --> 00:19:51,616
Run! You have to protect Nezuko!

273
00:20:00,595 --> 00:20:01,408
How?

274
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:14,451
I see it, the opening thread!

275
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:17,159
You have to take him down now,

276
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:21,708
even if it means getting slashed in the process!

277
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:26,468
Nezuko. Nezuko.

278
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,951
Wake up, Nezuko.

279
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,546
You need to save your brother.

280
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,247
You're capable of doing so.

281
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:38,770
I know you are.

282
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,206
Nezuko, help him.

283
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,416
Your brother will be killed if you don't!

284
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:56,730
Blood demon art.

285
00:20:58,213 --> 00:20:59,906
Exploding blood!

286
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,021
Impossible!

287
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,196
The threads were burned away?

288
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,684
The bond between Nezuko and I

289
00:21:16,348 --> 00:21:19,834
cannot be severed, not by anyone!
