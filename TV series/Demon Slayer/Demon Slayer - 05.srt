1
00:00:00,496 --> 00:00:02,806
Your mask is what gives you away.

2
00:00:03,564 --> 00:00:06,706
Except that's how I pick out who to eat.

3
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,158
Total concentration.

4
00:00:26,552 --> 00:00:27,784
Water breathing!

5
00:00:32,553 --> 00:00:33,553
First form!

6
00:00:41,636 --> 00:00:43,240
Water surface slash!

7
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:44,915
Urokodaki!

8
00:03:55,497 --> 00:03:58,715
No! No! No!

9
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:02,453
My body's falling apart and disappearing,

10
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:04,586
and I can't stop it!

11
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:15,599
Damn it. The face of this demon slayer

12
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:18,618
is the last thing I'm ever going to see.

13
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,309
I never would have thought it'd come to this.

14
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,419
I'm so scared. I'm all alone now.

15
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:40,672
Brother, where are you?

16
00:04:42,678 --> 00:04:46,781
I want you to hold my hand again like you always do.

17
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:51,269
Why? Why did I do it?

18
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,101
Why would I eat my own big brother?

19
00:04:58,294 --> 00:04:59,643
I had a brother?

20
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:01,278
I'd forgotten.

21
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,380
What a sad scent.

22
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:25,819
Please, god, help him.

23
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:34,648
The next time this man is reborn,

24
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:38,649
please don't let him turn into a demon again.

25
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:41,907
Brother!

26
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:44,659
Brother, wait up!

27
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:46,448
Can you please hold my hand?

28
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,058
You scaredy-cat.

29
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:52,248
You're hopeless. You know that?

30
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:18,519
Sabito, Makomo...

31
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:22,269
And all the others whose lives were taken by this demon...

32
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:24,779
It's over.

33
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:27,029
You can rest now.

34
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,355
Finally you're going home as promised,

35
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:44,609
back to mount Sagiri, if only as souls.

36
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:53,242
You're going back to Urokodaki.

37
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:04,033
If I had failed, that's where
my soul would have gone, too.

38
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:20,993
I've got a question!

39
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,136
Once someone's been turned into a demon,

40
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,628
how do they change back?

41
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:39,128
Someone, please,

42
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:40,568
tell me.

43
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,040
How do I turn Nezuko back?!

44
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:23,089
That's Wisteria.

45
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:27,660
I made it.

46
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,859
Only four of us?

47
00:08:46,501 --> 00:08:48,366
We started with over 20.

48
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:50,692
So he didn't make it.

49
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:53,894
He's gone,

50
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,999
and it's all because I blacked out.

51
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:58,928
I couldn't save him.

52
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:01,278
I'm gonna die.

53
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:02,642
I'm done for.

54
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:06,726
I've survived for now, but, soon enough, dead.

55
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,535
Welcome back, everyone.

56
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:17,501
And congratulations.

57
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:19,970
We're pleased to see you're safe.

58
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:24,277
So? I made it back alive. What do I do now?

59
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,384
Where's my sword?

60
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,722
Patience. We must first issue you all uniforms.

61
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,531
We'll start by taking your measurements.

62
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:37,098
Next, your rank will be engraved on the back of your hand.

63
00:09:37,848 --> 00:09:40,991
For your reference, there are ten ranks in total.

64
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:42,350
Kinoe.

65
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,398
Kinoto.

66
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,521
Hinoe.

67
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:45,434
Hinoto.

68
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,585
Tsuchinoe.

69
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:47,886
Tsuchinoto.

70
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:48,870
Kanoe.

71
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:49,902
Kanoto.

72
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:50,925
Mizunoe.

73
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:52,450
Mizunoto.

74
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:54,825
You all start at mizunoto.

75
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:57,817
This is the lowest rank in the demon slayer corps.

76
00:09:58,702 --> 00:10:00,202
And our swords?

77
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:06,157
In a moment, you will be given the chance to
select the ore that will be used to forge your swords.

78
00:10:06,715 --> 00:10:10,547
However, it will be 10 to 15 days
before the weapons are ready for you.

79
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:12,272
Really?

80
00:10:12,297 --> 00:10:13,215
But first...

81
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:24,122
Now that you're demon slayers,

82
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:27,168
you must each be assigned your own kasugai crow.

83
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:30,647
We get crows, then? What for?

84
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:35,565
The kasugai crows are primarily
used to facilitate communication.

85
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:37,839
Wait. "Crows"?

86
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,739
Isn't this a sparrow?

87
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,500
I don't need this crap!

88
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:50,006
Who the hell cares about some stupid crow?!

89
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,688
I want my sword right now.

90
00:10:57,786 --> 00:10:59,945
Give it to me before I get angry,

91
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:02,160
the color changing katana.

92
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:04,480
I want it now! Do you hear me?!

93
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:10,384
Take your hand off her,

94
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,575
or I'll break your arm. Now!

95
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:16,272
Who the hell are you?

96
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,717
Wh-what do I do?!

97
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:21,206
Give it your best shot.

98
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,311
Are you finished chatting with each other?

99
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:52,633
Now the time has come.

100
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,568
Please select an ore to use for your sword.

101
00:11:57,766 --> 00:12:02,467
The steel you will use to protect
yourself and to annihilate countless demons

102
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:04,582
will be that of your own choosing.

103
00:12:05,562 --> 00:12:08,425
I'm gonna be dead soon anyway, probably.

104
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:16,679
They want us to choose,

105
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:19,064
but how are we supposed to pick one?

106
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,842
I've never even laid eyes on ore.

107
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,842
I can't tell the difference between any of them.

108
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:30,271
I don't have a clue what to pick.

109
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:51,605
Really?

110
00:12:55,522 --> 00:12:57,308
Five of them managed to survive?

111
00:12:58,564 --> 00:12:59,887
That's excellent.

112
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,884
The number of my children continues to grow.

113
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,458
What kinds of swordsmen will they be?

114
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:33,702
I'm so naive...

115
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,087
And a fool.

116
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:38,653
I couldn't even get a demon to talk to me.

117
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,248
All any of them wanted to do was kill me.

118
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:45,678
Ah, Nezuko. I'm sorry.

119
00:13:47,885 --> 00:13:50,178
I'm no closer to finding a cure,

120
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:53,448
to making her human again.

121
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:02,140
My uniform feels heavy.

122
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,352
I wanna get home...

123
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:06,892
But every part of me hurts.

124
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:36,735
I made it.

125
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:38,855
Nezuko.

126
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,483
Urokodaki.

127
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:52,709
Nezuko!

128
00:14:53,104 --> 00:14:55,959
It's you! You're awake!

129
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:00,222
Nezuko!

130
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:14,914
Why'd you do that?

131
00:15:15,518 --> 00:15:17,834
Why'd you have to sleep for so long?

132
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,390
I thought you were never gonna wake up!

133
00:15:22,703 --> 00:15:25,315
I was afraid you were gonna die!

134
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:33,339
You're here.

135
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:35,584
You came back alive.

136
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:49,348
You did it.

137
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:51,915
You were able to kill that mutated demon.

138
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,348
Yes.

139
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:56,921
Then, it's over.

140
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:01,857
I'm truly impressed that you made it back.

141
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:02,738
Thanks.

142
00:16:05,316 --> 00:16:06,365
You should know

143
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:08,721
there are different kinds of demons.

144
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:15,022
The blood demon art is a special spell
that some use to give them abilities.

145
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:20,823
You may end up having to face some
of them in the near future as well,

146
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:23,628
and fighting against supernatural abilities

147
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,733
will be more difficult than anything you've done.

148
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:32,155
Still, Tanjiro, I have no doubt that you'll be just fine.

149
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:34,381
Right.

150
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:41,502
So it seems like Nezuko's a whole
lot different from other demons.

151
00:16:42,032 --> 00:16:45,147
Do you think that's because of
this bloody art thingie, then?

152
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:48,096
No, I think it's something else.

153
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:51,901
I wouldn't call that an example of the blood demon art.

154
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:54,901
This is only a guess,

155
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,901
but I believe Nezuko can recover her strength by sleeping,

156
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:03,135
instead of consuming human flesh as other demons do.

157
00:17:07,522 --> 00:17:10,557
Don't worry. I'll protect you, Nezuko.

158
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:40,288
Hi there.

159
00:17:40,387 --> 00:17:42,352
My name is Haganezuka.

160
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:45,788
I've forged Tanjiro Kamado's sword.

161
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:47,375
I am here to deliver it.

162
00:17:47,618 --> 00:17:48,206
Oh.

163
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:53,357
Sorry. I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

164
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,036
Come in.

165
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:57,352
This is a nichirin sword.

166
00:17:57,713 --> 00:17:59,473
I forged it myself.

167
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:00,353
Um...

168
00:18:00,918 --> 00:18:02,497
Do you wanna come in, have some...

169
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:07,775
The materials for this kind of sword only
come from the mountain closest to the sun,

170
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:13,465
made of scarlet iron sand and scarlet ore, unique.

171
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:16,450
They produce steel that can absorb sunlight.

172
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:18,200
Wow, really?

173
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:21,959
You see, mount Yoko is bathed in sunlight all day,

174
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:24,316
never a cloud in the...

175
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:28,850
The man still refuses to listen
to a word anyone else says.

176
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:31,663
A clown mask?

177
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:33,681
Hmm? Hmm?!

178
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:38,027
Hey, you're a child of brightness, aren't you?

179
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,890
Well, isn't that lucky?

180
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,650
Uh, my parents's names were Tanjuro and Kie.

181
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:47,150
That's not what I mean.

182
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:51,473
You know how your hair and
eyes have a reddish hue to them?

183
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:55,156
When a family that works with fire has a child like you,

184
00:18:55,232 --> 00:18:58,500
it's considered lucky and cause for celebration.

185
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,402
Is it, really? I had no idea.

186
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:05,238
That means there's a good chance this sword will turn red.

187
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,420
Right, Urokodaki?

188
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:08,741
Yes.

189
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,920
Come on. Draw it, already.

190
00:19:16,143 --> 00:19:20,788
Nichirin swords are also referred
to as "color changing katanas,"

191
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,271
because, depending on the bearer, they change color.

192
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:52,700
Black?!

193
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:53,802
That's interesting.

194
00:19:54,606 --> 00:19:57,478
Why? Does turning black mean something bad?

195
00:19:58,389 --> 00:19:59,738
Is it unlucky?

196
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:02,787
No, no. It's just that it's a little unusual.

197
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:05,677
You don't see it often. It's pitch-black.

198
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:11,190
But I was really hoping I'd get
to see a sword turn bright red!

199
00:20:11,413 --> 00:20:12,690
Damn it!

200
00:20:15,236 --> 00:20:17,688
Ouch! Hey, let go!

201
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:19,448
Stop! Please! Ow!

202
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:20,910
How old are you, anyway?

203
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:22,725
I'm 37!

204
00:20:31,048 --> 00:20:32,838
Tanjiro Kamado,

205
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:34,838
I bring you orders.

206
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:37,430
Huh? It can talk?

207
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:41,180
You must go to a town northwest of here,

208
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:42,930
and hurry.

209
00:20:43,229 --> 00:20:45,680
Young girls are disappearing.

210
00:21:02,364 --> 00:21:06,714
Night after night, at least one of them vanishes!

211
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:12,550
You must hunt down the demon responsible and destroy it!

212
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,272
Tanjiro Kamado, prepare yourself well!

213
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:19,160
This is your first assignment

214
00:21:19,343 --> 00:21:22,345
as a member of the demon slayer corps!

215
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:24,067
All right.

216
00:21:24,652 --> 00:21:25,552
It's time.
