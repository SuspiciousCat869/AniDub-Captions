1
00:00:03,386 --> 00:00:06,340
Time for you to die!

2
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,149
Twist! Envelop!

3
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:22,190
Twisting whirlpool! Flowing water!

4
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,330
My sword is so heavy.

5
00:00:31,102 --> 00:00:32,329
But I've got this!

6
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:34,846
Second form improved!

7
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:38,261
Lateral water wheel!

8
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:33,213
I did it.

9
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:36,016
The whirlpool isn't as strong when it's not underwater,

10
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:40,500
but I used his attack to gain
power and envelop the arrows.

11
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,708
You damn brat!

12
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:46,255
How could you do this to me?!

13
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:48,150
I just needed to bring him your head.

14
00:02:48,175 --> 00:02:50,973
That's all it would have taken
to finally win his approval!

15
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,276
I'll never forgive you. I'll make
sure you pay for what you've done to me!

16
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:59,577
My face is filthy because of you shoving it into the dirt!

17
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:02,144
I swear I'll bring you down with me!

18
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:06,597
Oh, no! He's got me!

19
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:11,751
This force is stronger than any of
the arrows he's hit me with before.

20
00:03:12,162 --> 00:03:15,976
Have to defend myself with every
move I've got, or my body'll be smashed!

21
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:18,222
Fourth form!

22
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:19,669
Striking tide!

23
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,920
My body's under so much pressure,

24
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:28,975
I can't swing my sword!

25
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:30,335
Do something.

26
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:31,641
Make a move!

27
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:35,042
Don't get beaten, not here!

28
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:38,497
Second form! Water wheel!

29
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:45,445
Waterfall basin!

30
00:03:48,757 --> 00:03:49,911
Surface slash!

31
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,115
Drop ripple thrust!

32
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:54,157
Sixth form! Whirlpool!

33
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,202
I've never used so many moves in a row before.

34
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,221
It feels like my arms are gonna get ripped off.

35
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:03,871
You haven't suffered enough.

36
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,080
I'm not done, not just yet.

37
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:08,519
Your pain will be excruciating.

38
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:17,565
How long will this go on?

39
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:19,145
When will it end?

40
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:21,597
Don't think about it!

41
00:04:21,622 --> 00:04:23,064
Just keep fighting back!

42
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:25,435
Pull out all the stops!

43
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:32,465
Still not enough.

44
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:35,520
Not yet! I still haven't...

45
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:56,105
Nezuko.

46
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:57,565
Miss Tamayo.

47
00:04:57,961 --> 00:04:59,145
Yushiro.

48
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:03,753
I cracked my rib and broke my leg.

49
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:11,214
I-It's no use.

50
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,581
I'm so exhausted, I can't even grip my sword.

51
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:16,404
I gotta go...

52
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:18,710
I gotta get over there.

53
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:21,293
There's one more demon left.

54
00:05:24,913 --> 00:05:26,665
Hang on. I'm coming.

55
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:29,137
I'll be there soon.

56
00:05:29,385 --> 00:05:30,734
Just hang on.

57
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:33,924
I'm coming. Stay safe!

58
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,807
What a fool!

59
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:52,275
Avoiding a bunch of linear attacks like these
is child's play! Finding you will be easy, too!

60
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:57,722
And finding you will be a piece of cake.

61
00:05:57,747 --> 00:06:00,310
You may be good at that concealment spell,

62
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:02,385
but I know right where you are!

63
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:12,633
Now's when the real fun starts!

64
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:14,863
Don't do that!

65
00:06:14,923 --> 00:06:17,716
You can't be reckless just because you're immortal!

66
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:23,979
Uh, what is it?

67
00:06:25,621 --> 00:06:27,849
What are you doing?! Watch out!

68
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:37,642
Amazing.

69
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,165
Lady Tamayo.

70
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:55,302
you little brat. You think you're tough,

71
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:58,832
just because you figured out
how to kick my temari back at me?

72
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:00,760
Don't be so arrogant!

73
00:07:20,443 --> 00:07:22,550
Damn you, you brat!

74
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:26,816
But how?

75
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:29,473
Lady Tamayo, what did you do to her?

76
00:07:29,545 --> 00:07:34,820
I just gave her a healing serum made
specifically for demons, but all it did was heal her.

77
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:39,854
It has no effect on her physical strength.

78
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:42,549
We're witnessing Nezuko's power.

79
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:47,321
Without even a drop of human blood, this is all her.

80
00:07:48,856 --> 00:07:51,113
She's rapidly gaining strength.

81
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:04,989
But her opponent is formidable.

82
00:08:05,473 --> 00:08:08,839
If she gave it her all, Nezuko wouldn't stand a chance.

83
00:08:09,912 --> 00:08:10,978
She needs help.

84
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,122
Let's see what I can do.

85
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:18,818
Aren't you an amusing little girl?

86
00:08:18,843 --> 00:08:22,013
Looks like I'm going to have
to give this everything I've got.

87
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:25,470
I'm curious to see how long you can hold out.

88
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,530
If you're a Twelve Kizuki, I have a question.

89
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,010
Get out of the way.

90
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:34,533
Move it, you damn fugitive.

91
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:37,337
One question, that's all I'm asking.

92
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:41,684
Do you have any idea who Kibutsuji really is?

93
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,391
Huh?

94
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,362
What the hell are you saying?!

95
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:45,861
He's a coward.

96
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:48,183
Surely you've realized that.

97
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:51,164
He's in a constant state of fear.

98
00:08:51,606 --> 00:08:52,810
How dare you?

99
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,204
Damn you! Shut up!

100
00:08:55,098 --> 00:08:58,460
Do you want to know why no demons can ever group together

101
00:08:59,728 --> 00:09:02,281
or why they cannibalize each other?

102
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,546
Because he doesn't want us to group up.

103
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:08,143
His fear is that we would attack him if we could.

104
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:12,049
He manipulates demons to make them behave,

105
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:14,144
demons like you.

106
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,281
Don't you dare.

107
00:09:16,912 --> 00:09:18,502
Don't say that! Shut up!

108
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:20,737
He has no reason to be so petty!

109
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:23,586
Of course.

110
00:09:24,036 --> 00:09:26,289
Lady Tamayo is casting a spell.

111
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,443
You can't comprehend the power he wields!

112
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:34,198
No one's stronger than him, not lord Kibutsuji!

113
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:43,273
You forgot you couldn't say his name, didn't you?

114
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,685
You just triggered the curse.

115
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:52,467
Magical aroma of daylight.

116
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:55,476
It weakens the target's brain functions,

117
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:58,984
making it impossible for them to lie or keep secrets.

118
00:10:00,276 --> 00:10:01,825
And it's so potent.

119
00:10:02,277 --> 00:10:03,404
Lady Tamayo.

120
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:10,290
I feel sorry for you. But farewell now.

121
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:16,474
Please forgive me! I'm so sorry!

122
00:10:16,678 --> 00:10:17,993
I'm begging you!

123
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:20,824
I didn't mean to! Please forgive me!

124
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:50,182
Is it all over? Is she dead?

125
00:11:51,194 --> 00:11:53,220
She will be momentarily.

126
00:11:54,658 --> 00:11:56,418
Kibutsuji's curse.

127
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,013
The cells he left in her body will destroy it.

128
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,515
She'll be ripped apart from the inside.

129
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:09,107
Generally speaking, a battle between demons is futile.

130
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:11,369
It's pointless.

131
00:12:11,922 --> 00:12:14,606
The wounds they inflict on each other can't be fatal.

132
00:12:15,732 --> 00:12:19,540
Only sunlight or the sword of
a demon slayer can kill them.

133
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:24,381
Except Kibutsuji.

134
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:27,722
He's the only one who can destroy a demon's cells.

135
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:35,798
You can't inhale lady Tamayo's spell.

136
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:37,500
The human body can't take it.

137
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:39,081
You got that?

138
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,278
Tanjiro...

139
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:43,744
The demon we fought,

140
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,997
she's not one of the Twelve Kizuki.

141
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:52,764
The Twelve Kizuki all have numbers engraved
on their eyeballs, but she doesn't have one,

142
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:58,073
which means that the other
demon most likely doesn't, either.

143
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:00,046
They were too weak.

144
00:13:00,897 --> 00:13:03,223
Hmm? Too weak? Really?!

145
00:13:04,474 --> 00:13:07,360
Don't question her. Lady Tamayo's never wrong.

146
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:11,558
Pathetic. That demon was incredibly stupid.

147
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:16,970
She thought she could get away with hurting
lady Tamayo. She deserved what happened to her.

148
00:13:21,337 --> 00:13:26,792
With any luck, this blood will still be
instrumental for us in developing a cure.

149
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,530
Now I need to take care of Nezuko.

150
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:35,949
She was already medicated, and she inhaled my spell,

151
00:13:36,555 --> 00:13:38,359
for which I'm deeply sorry.

152
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,905
All right, don't move a muscle!

153
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:43,405
You're on your own now.

154
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:45,822
I won't leave lady Tamayo's side,

155
00:13:46,162 --> 00:13:47,277
not for a second!

156
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:56,827
Mari.

157
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,093
Hmm?

158
00:13:59,648 --> 00:14:00,768
Mari.

159
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:03,032
Mari.

160
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:17,208
Here's your temari.

161
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:20,260
Play with me.

162
00:14:22,118 --> 00:14:23,747
Play with me.

163
00:14:26,188 --> 00:14:28,306
You probably murdered dozens,

164
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:32,363
but, inside, you're just a little kid.

165
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,401
You thought you were one of the Twelve Kizuki,

166
00:14:53,984 --> 00:14:56,562
deceived, forced to fight,

167
00:14:57,213 --> 00:15:01,046
and now it's Kibutsuji's curse that killed you.

168
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:04,174
No salvation.

169
00:15:06,462 --> 00:15:09,159
Once you die, not even your bones remain.

170
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:15,954
Is this the price you pay for killing people?

171
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:28,317
Kibutsuji.

172
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,596
Even the people who follow him get treated this way.

173
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:36,355
He truly is a demon.

174
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,579
Miss Tamayo!

175
00:15:54,316 --> 00:15:55,902
Hey, Yushiro?

176
00:15:56,312 --> 00:15:57,471
We're over here.

177
00:15:58,521 --> 00:15:59,066
Wha...

178
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,209
You really don't need to come down,

179
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,277
but if you want to, hurry it up.

180
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:06,788
Yushiro!

181
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:07,772
Just kidding!

182
00:16:09,144 --> 00:16:11,517
It's all right. Come on down, Tanjiro.

183
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,744
Oh, okay.

184
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:22,895
Nezuko!

185
00:16:25,238 --> 00:16:28,447
I thought it best to get her down
to the basement before daybreak.

186
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:30,311
The sunlight won't reach us here.

187
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:33,250
Nezuko?

188
00:16:38,685 --> 00:16:40,092
What are you doing?!

189
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:41,867
Step away from lady Tamayo!

190
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:43,088
That's so rude!

191
00:16:43,222 --> 00:16:44,863
Calm down, Yushiro.

192
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:46,782
I don't mind at all.

193
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:47,982
Right!

194
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,840
You're so kind, lady Tamayo,

195
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:52,875
too beautiful to believe.

196
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,169
No! Stop!

197
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:02,270
It's a bit strange. She's been
acting like this ever since she woke up.

198
00:17:02,886 --> 00:17:04,658
I wonder if she's all right.

199
00:17:04,947 --> 00:17:06,499
There's nothing to worry about.

200
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:07,666
She's just fine.

201
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:10,978
If I were to make a guess,

202
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,182
I'd say she thinks of you both as family.

203
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:15,088
Knock it off!

204
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:16,405
Us as family?

205
00:17:17,594 --> 00:17:22,866
But wait. I thought the spell Nezuko was
under only made her see humans as family,

206
00:17:23,612 --> 00:17:25,911
and Yushiro and I are demons.

207
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,316
I said stop!

208
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,314
Not to Nezuko.

209
00:17:29,535 --> 00:17:31,812
You two are as human as anyone to her.

210
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,834
She wanted to protect you.

211
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:41,294
You know, I didn't like the idea of that spell at first,

212
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,150
but she still seems to have a will of her own, so...

213
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:51,159
I'm so sorry! Nezuko, stop it! Get away from her!

214
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:52,865
You're being very rude!

215
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:55,634
Thank you.

216
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,946
Thank you so much, Nezuko.

217
00:18:11,787 --> 00:18:15,212
There is a way for me to keep you alive, if you want.

218
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:20,695
However, it will cost you your humanity.

219
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:23,992
If I don't do it,

220
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:26,622
you will indeed succumb to your illness.

221
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:30,352
But beware. If you lose your humanity,

222
00:18:30,658 --> 00:18:32,479
that will cause pain as well.

223
00:18:34,117 --> 00:18:37,420
So tell me. Do you still wish to live?

224
00:18:46,947 --> 00:18:49,585
Yushiro and I will be leaving this region.

225
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:50,346
Huh?

226
00:18:51,225 --> 00:18:53,312
We're too close to Kibutsuji now.

227
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:56,945
It's far too risky to stay
here. We need a new place to hide.

228
00:18:58,078 --> 00:19:00,881
Besides, I think I've hidden my identity,

229
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:03,458
but, after treating so many humans,

230
00:19:03,705 --> 00:19:06,115
I'm sure some of them figured out I'm a demon.

231
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,051
Children and the elderly are especially perceptive.

232
00:19:11,098 --> 00:19:12,185
So, Tanjiro...

233
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:13,085
Yes?

234
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:15,595
To protect Nezuko,

235
00:19:15,928 --> 00:19:18,511
would you like us to take her with us when we go?

236
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,295
Obviously I can't promise her safety,

237
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:28,171
but I believe she'll face less
danger than she will in battle.

238
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:33,501
She might be right.

239
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,830
With them, wherever they end up, Nezuko would be safer.

240
00:19:54,345 --> 00:19:57,226
Miss Tamayo, thank you for your concern,

241
00:19:58,455 --> 00:20:01,303
but Nezuko's staying with me.

242
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:04,032
Nothing's gonna break us apart.

243
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:08,081
No. Never again.

244
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:12,580
Yes, I understand.

245
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,527
Well, I wish you good fortune, then.

246
00:20:15,987 --> 00:20:16,743
All right.

247
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:20,380
We will be leaving as soon as we cover our tracks.

248
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:22,559
You should get moving as well.

249
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:25,447
You're right, and good luck.

250
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:27,649
Thank you for everything you've done for us.

251
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:31,095
Let's go, Nezuko.

252
00:20:32,283 --> 00:20:33,203
Hey!

253
00:20:34,053 --> 00:20:35,906
That doesn't mean you need to run!

254
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:36,893
Tanjiro!

255
00:20:40,818 --> 00:20:42,478
Your little sister...

256
00:20:42,578 --> 00:20:44,065
I guess she is a beauty.

257
00:20:51,477 --> 00:20:53,424
South-southeast!

258
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:57,034
South-southeast! South-southeast!

259
00:20:57,174 --> 00:21:00,328
The next place you need to go is south-southeast!

260
00:21:00,415 --> 00:21:01,637
I heard you!

261
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:04,583
You don't have to keep squawking it at me, okay?

262
00:21:04,678 --> 00:21:05,884
I'm begging you!

263
00:21:05,957 --> 00:21:07,990
I got the message, so be quiet!

264
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:08,957
Please!

265
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,995
Please! Please! Please!

266
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:14,848
Please marry me!

267
00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:18,030
You know I could die any day now!

268
00:21:18,156 --> 00:21:20,735
Marry me so I don't die alone!

269
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,034
Marry me! I'm begging you, please!

270
00:21:24,087 --> 00:21:26,380
Wh-what is he doing?

271
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:28,455
What on earth?
