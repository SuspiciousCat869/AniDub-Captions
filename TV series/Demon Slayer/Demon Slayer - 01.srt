1
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:26,098
How?

2
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:32,203
How in the world could something like this happen?

3
00:00:33,947 --> 00:00:35,160
Come on, Nezuko!

4
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,586
I've got you! Don't die on me!

5
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,640
No matter what it takes, I'll save you!

6
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,366
I won't let you die.

7
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:47,981
I promise I'll save you.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,333
Your big brother's got you!

9
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,096
Tanjiro.

10
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:09,641
Your face is all covered in soot.

11
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,267
Let me clean you up.

12
00:01:13,964 --> 00:01:15,976
You know, you really don't have to go.

13
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:18,054
All this snow could be dangerous.

14
00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:20,955
I want us to have a good new year's celebration

15
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,028
where everyone can eat as much as they want,

16
00:01:23,403 --> 00:01:25,603
so I'll sell all the charcoal I can.

17
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,586
How thoughtful.

18
00:01:29,746 --> 00:01:30,846
Hey, bro!

19
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,437
Are you going to town again today?

20
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,272
I'm coming with you!

21
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:38,759
No, you're not.

22
00:01:38,878 --> 00:01:42,313
You know you can't walk as fast as Tanjiro can, sweetie.

23
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,880
Aw, come on, mom!

24
00:01:44,132 --> 00:01:45,195
No way.

25
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:48,114
He's not going to be able to use the cart today,

26
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:51,231
which means he can't give you a ride when you get tired.

27
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:54,626
Tanjiro!

28
00:01:56,306 --> 00:01:58,006
I wanna come with you.

29
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:00,457
I promise I'll help out.

30
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,188
That's very generous of you, Hanako.

31
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:04,502
But no.

32
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:06,042
You're staying home today.

33
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,785
Sorry, Shigeru. You are, too.

34
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,740
But I'll bring back goodies, okay?

35
00:02:13,986 --> 00:02:14,886
Promise?

36
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:15,948
Yeah.

37
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:19,011
And, Hanako,

38
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:20,873
I'll read for you when I get home later.

39
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:21,706
'Kay!

40
00:02:22,246 --> 00:02:23,321
Good girl.

41
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,578
Thank you for doing this, Tanjiro.

42
00:02:25,665 --> 00:02:26,385
'Course.

43
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,493
Time for me to head out.

44
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:32,316
Hey, Takeo, do me a favor while I'm gone, okay?

45
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,207
Chop as much wood as you can.

46
00:02:34,482 --> 00:02:37,339
Yeah, I was already gonna do that anyway.

47
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:41,318
But I was kinda hoping we'd do
that together this time. Hmph.

48
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:43,948
There, there, now.

49
00:02:44,015 --> 00:02:45,477
Knock it off, would you?!

50
00:02:45,654 --> 00:02:47,034
You're blushing, take!

51
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:48,700
Shut up, you brat!

52
00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:49,879
There, there, now.

53
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,726
I told you to cut it out!

54
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:59,301
Come back as soon as you can, okay?

55
00:02:59,585 --> 00:03:01,552
Be safe, and see you when you get back!

56
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:08,248
Hi, Tanjiro.

57
00:03:09,026 --> 00:03:10,260
Hey, Nezuko.

58
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:13,132
I had to put Rokuta down for a nap now.

59
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,287
Otherwise, he would throw a fit.

60
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:19,022
Ever since dad passed, he's been glued to your side.

61
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:24,438
In fact, everyone seems to follow you wherever you go.

62
00:03:26,777 --> 00:03:28,511
I'll see you when you get back!

63
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:35,437
We don't exactly have an easy life, but we're happy.

64
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,154
Life can change, though,

65
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,809
as sudden as the weather.

66
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:43,323
It shifts and moves on.

67
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,536
The sun can't shine forever,

68
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,424
and the snow has to stop at some point.

69
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,927
But whatever happens, when happiness is destroyed,

70
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:58,415
it's always followed by the smell of blood.

71
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:09,661
Ah, Tanjiro!

72
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:12,637
You came down the mountain on a day like today?

73
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:16,707
Don't you ever stop working? You could catch a cold.

74
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:18,647
It's not as bad as you think.

75
00:04:18,778 --> 00:04:21,079
You need a refill on charcoal, by any chance?

76
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:23,272
Hey, Tanjiro!

77
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:23,752
Eh?

78
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:25,809
I'll take some more!

79
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:29,728
I'm good, but thanks for fixing
my sliding doors the other day.

80
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,936
I need some charcoal, too!

81
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:37,567
Tanjiro!

82
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,701
I'm so glad you're here!

83
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:43,290
I've been accused of breaking this plate!

84
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,817
Can you help me out here?

85
00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:46,043
Give it a sniff!

86
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:52,601
It smells like a cat to me.

87
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,854
You see?

88
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:55,937
So it really was a cat.

89
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,290
I tried to tell you I didn't do it!

90
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,763
Hey there, Tanjiro!

91
00:04:59,862 --> 00:05:03,283
I don't suppose you could give me
a hand with this luggage, could you?

92
00:05:07,745 --> 00:05:09,432
How'd it get so late?

93
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:12,823
Oh, well. At least I sold out.

94
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:16,123
Hang on! Tanjiro!

95
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:16,823
Eh?

96
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,051
You're not going back up the mountain now.

97
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:22,297
It's simply too dangerous.

98
00:05:22,357 --> 00:05:24,905
Oh, I'll be fine. I've got a good nose.

99
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:27,540
You can stay here for the night.

100
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,670
Come on. Get inside.

101
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:31,607
No, I'm..

102
00:05:31,712 --> 00:05:33,495
Don't argue. Just get in here...

103
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,130
Before the demons show up.

104
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:51,366
Thanks for dinner.

105
00:05:56,113 --> 00:06:00,957
Hey, uh, Mr. Saburo, what did you mean by "demons"?

106
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:05,480
There have always been man-eating
demons prowling about after dark.

107
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,353
That's why it's not safe to go outside at night.

108
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:13,675
Time for bed.

109
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:16,252
You can set off for home at first light.

110
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:21,999
These demons,

111
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:24,992
they're not able to come inside your house, are they?

112
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:28,398
Yes, they could come in.

113
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:35,511
But, then, wouldn't they just eat everyone?

114
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:42,271
The demon slayers protect us
by killing as many as they can.

115
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,188
They always have.

116
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,598
Now go to sleep.

117
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,073
It's lights out.

118
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:53,989
Old man Saburo,

119
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:56,571
he's been on his own since he lost his family.

120
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,313
He must be lonely.

121
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:01,392
I'll bring my brothers and sisters by.

122
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,201
You don't have to be scared.

123
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:06,208
There are no demons. You're safe.

124
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,679
Although, now that I think of it,

125
00:07:09,903 --> 00:07:12,141
my grandma used to say the same thing

126
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,706
before she passed away.

127
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,126
You be careful now.

128
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:22,353
Thank you!

129
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:33,659
Whenever happiness is destroyed...

130
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,802
It's always followed...

131
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:39,325
Eh?

132
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:44,190
The smell of blood.

133
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:08,623
Nezuko!

134
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:12,182
What happened?! What's going on here?!

135
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:14,284
What happened to you?!

136
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:21,026
Mom?

137
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:30,854
Mom. Hanako.

138
00:08:32,116 --> 00:08:34,431
Takeo. Shigeru.

139
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:38,468
Nezuko. Rokuta.

140
00:08:46,345 --> 00:08:48,566
Nezuko's the only one who's still warm.

141
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:52,554
If I can get her to a doctor, she might live.

142
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,840
How could something like this happen?

143
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:57,711
Maybe a bear...

144
00:08:57,851 --> 00:08:59,818
That couldn't find a place to hibernate?

145
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:07,795
I can't breathe!

146
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,801
The air is icy! My lungs hurt!

147
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:13,144
Just keep moving!

148
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,670
Move those legs of yours faster!

149
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:19,915
We've still got a long way to go to get to town. Hurry!

150
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:22,827
I won't let you die.

151
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,129
No matter what it takes,

152
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,575
your big brother will save you!

153
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,436
Oh, no!

154
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:49,829
The snow saved me...

155
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:53,726
But the snow is the only reason I fell.

156
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:56,307
Nezuko?

157
00:10:03,258 --> 00:10:05,580
Nezuko, are you okay?

158
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,157
You don't have to walk!

159
00:10:08,468 --> 00:10:10,503
Let me carry you to town, all right?

160
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:12,556
Nezuko!

161
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:23,314
Sh-she's...

162
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:25,591
A demon!

163
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:30,319
This is what old man Saburo tried to tell me about.

164
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:33,700
She's a man-eating demon?

165
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,544
Impossible! Nezuko's a human

166
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,311
since the day she was born!

167
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:42,266
Except she doesn't have Nezuko's scent anymore.

168
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,676
But she isn't the one who killed them.

169
00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:48,991
She was lying on top of Rokuta
like she was protecting him,

170
00:10:49,058 --> 00:10:51,332
and her hands and mouth weren't covered in blood,

171
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:55,458
but there was one more. There was another scent!

172
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:02,364
How are you getting bigger?!

173
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:06,706
And she's getting stronger, too!

174
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:10,521
While I was sleeping like a baby at Saburo's,

175
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,864
you were all being brutally murdered!

176
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:14,981
It must have hurt.

177
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,034
You suffered, didn't you?

178
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:20,537
I'm sorry I wasn't there to help.

179
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,329
I have to at least save Nezuko, though!

180
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:28,846
But she's too strong for me to do anything!

181
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:32,411
Nezuko! Hang on, Nezuko!

182
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:35,540
Don't give in! You gotta hang on!

183
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,845
Don't let it take control!

184
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,787
You gotta stay strong!

185
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:44,264
Just hang on! Please!

186
00:12:03,031 --> 00:12:03,691
Eh?

187
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:17,572
What the...

188
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:22,968
Who's that?

189
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:28,747
A sword?

190
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:31,496
Why are you protecting it?

191
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:32,765
She's my sister!

192
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:34,598
I was taking her to get help!

193
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,616
Nezuko!

194
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,835
You call that thing your sister?

195
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:01,730
Nezuko!

196
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:02,630
Don't move!

197
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:09,687
My job is to slay every demon I find,

198
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:12,818
which means I have to decapitate your sister here.

199
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,539
No, wait!

200
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,661
Nezuko hasn't hurt anyone!

201
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:18,904
Back at my house,

202
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:22,101
there was another scent I'd never smelled before!

203
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:26,084
That's probably the one who killed my family!

204
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,301
Nezuko didn't do it!

205
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:31,741
I don't know why she's changed into something like this,

206
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,412
but still...

207
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:35,448
It's really quite simple.

208
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:39,458
She's turned because her wounds
were exposed to demon blood.

209
00:13:40,772 --> 00:13:43,937
That's how the man-eating monsters multiply.

210
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,403
Nezuko would never eat a human!

211
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:48,616
You must be joking.

212
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:52,648
If I hadn't gotten here when I
did, she would have devoured you.

213
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,300
You're wrong! She wouldn't hurt me!

214
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,060
She knows I'm her big brother!

215
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,468
And I won't let her hurt anyone!

216
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,836
I'll turn her back into a human!

217
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:03,671
I will heal her!

218
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:05,626
She can't be healed.

219
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:09,041
Once you become a demon, no one can ever turn back.

220
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:10,582
There's a way,

221
00:14:10,765 --> 00:14:13,018
and I'll find it, no matter what it takes,

222
00:14:13,388 --> 00:14:15,124
so please let her live!

223
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,751
I'll hunt down the one who slaughtered my family!

224
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:22,037
I promise I'll make everything right! Please!

225
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,768
Just let her go!

226
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,356
Please don't do this!

227
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:29,601
Don't, don't take anyone else away from me.

228
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:32,971
I'm begging you.

229
00:14:34,302 --> 00:14:35,071
Please...

230
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,828
Don't kill my little sister.

231
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,996
Please don't do it!

232
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:42,718
I'm begging you.

233
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:55,162
Don't grovel like that and give
your enemies the chance to kill you!

234
00:14:56,617 --> 00:14:59,138
All you're doing is making yourself vulnerable!

235
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,689
If it were even a little bit effective,
your family would still be alive right now!

236
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:08,698
How can a weakling like you have any
hope of finding a way to heal his sister

237
00:15:09,103 --> 00:15:10,669
or hunt down a demon?!

238
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,977
Don't be ridiculous!

239
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:15,020
The weak have no rights.

240
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:19,971
They don't get to make choices! All they can
do is be relentlessly crushed by the strong!

241
00:15:20,593 --> 00:15:23,905
Now, maybe the demons know of a way to cure your sister.

242
00:15:24,365 --> 00:15:29,821
Maybe! But don't think for even a moment that
any one of them is going to respect your wishes,

243
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:32,221
just like I have no respect for you!

244
00:15:32,505 --> 00:15:33,780
That's reality.

245
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,166
And why the hell did you throw
yourself over her like that?

246
00:15:37,578 --> 00:15:39,644
Was that your way of protecting her?

247
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:41,764
Why didn't you swing that hatchet?

248
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,150
And why would you ever turn your back to me?

249
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:47,138
Those mistakes are what led to her capture!

250
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:50,560
I could have easily just skewered
the both of you and been done with it!

251
00:15:53,574 --> 00:15:54,701
Don't cry.

252
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:56,856
Don't succumb to sorrow.

253
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:59,335
This isn't the time to despair.

254
00:16:00,398 --> 00:16:02,805
I know you're devastated right now.

255
00:16:03,404 --> 00:16:06,872
Your family massacred. Your sister a demon.

256
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:08,412
I know it hurts.

257
00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:10,760
I know you want to scream.

258
00:16:11,427 --> 00:16:12,827
I understand.

259
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,250
If only I'd gotten here half a day sooner,

260
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:19,406
maybe then, your family would still be alive.

261
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:24,096
However, there's no way to turn back time,

262
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,331
so feel it.

263
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:29,555
Feel the pure rage of being unable to forgive.

264
00:16:30,097 --> 00:16:32,920
Let it be what gives you the strength to take action.

265
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,210
With that fragile resolve of yours,
you can't protect your sister or heal her,

266
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,547
and you'll never get revenge
for what happened to your family!

267
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,433
No!

268
00:16:44,859 --> 00:16:46,568
Don't you touch her!

269
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,869
You let your emotion drive you to charge at me.

270
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:05,402
You are a fool!

271
00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:21,437
Huh? What happened to the hatchet?

272
00:17:30,638 --> 00:17:32,852
Right before he went behind that tree...

273
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:37,135
He threw the rock, and, at the same time,

274
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:38,786
he tossed the hatchet.

275
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:42,202
He was only pretending to attack me

276
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:44,990
so I wouldn't realize he was unarmed.

277
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,618
He knew he had no way of beating me.

278
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:53,176
His whole plan was to bring me
down after I'd knocked him out.

279
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,029
This kid.

280
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:01,917
Damn it!

281
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:03,374
She'll kill him!

282
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,311
Nezuko...

283
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:14,600
Nezuko didn't do it.

284
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,598
She'd never eat a human!

285
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:23,401
Long ago,

286
00:18:23,544 --> 00:18:25,709
someone else said the same thing,

287
00:18:25,956 --> 00:18:28,049
only to end up being devoured.

288
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,997
A starving demon will eat anyone,

289
00:18:31,392 --> 00:18:34,245
its own brothers, sisters, parents.

290
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:36,701
They're rich in nutrients.

291
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,703
I've seen it more times than I can count.

292
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:43,351
This girl has been badly wounded.

293
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:46,672
She's using up a lot of energy to heal herself.

294
00:18:47,738 --> 00:18:51,532
And surely most of her strength
was drained during her transformation,

295
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:53,491
so there's no question.

296
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,444
She's starving right now.

297
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:59,283
She must have been craving a feast right from the start,

298
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:00,643
even her own brother,

299
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:03,078
but she protected him

300
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:05,244
and turned her attention to me.

301
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:09,927
I wonder if...

302
00:19:10,635 --> 00:19:11,880
Just maybe...

303
00:19:12,878 --> 00:19:14,368
These two are different.

304
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,412
We have to leave you behind, Tanjiro.

305
00:19:33,576 --> 00:19:34,771
I'm so sorry.

306
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:38,112
Take care of Nezuko.

307
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,833
You awake?

308
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:56,793
Get to mount Sagiri as soon as possible.

309
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,985
Look for an old man named Sakonji Urokodaki.

310
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:03,767
When you find him, tell him Giyu Tomioka sent you.

311
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:08,363
It's cloudy, so she seems to be all right at the moment,

312
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:11,051
but never let her be exposed to sunlight.

313
00:20:28,448 --> 00:20:29,394
Let's go.
