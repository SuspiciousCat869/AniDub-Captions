1
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:29,822
Let's go.

2
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:07,149
The demon slayer corps.

3
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:09,570
We number in the hundreds.

4
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:14,260
An organization completely unrecognized by the government.

5
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,672
Since ancient times, we have existed to hunt down demons.

6
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:27,239
However, the identity of the demon slayer
corps's leader has always remained a mystery.

7
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,295
Demons...

8
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:32,519
Their staple food, humans.

9
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:34,295
They hunt and kill them.

10
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:38,447
It is unclear when or where they first appeared.

11
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,775
Incredible physical prowess.

12
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,094
Their wounds heal almost instantly.

13
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:46,564
Flesh completely restores itself.

14
00:02:46,606 --> 00:02:49,121
Severed limbs regenerated.

15
00:02:49,693 --> 00:02:51,320
Some can shape-shift.

16
00:02:51,465 --> 00:02:53,364
Some have other powers.

17
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:56,141
They can only be killed by sunlight

18
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:59,005
or decapitation with a special sword.

19
00:03:00,686 --> 00:03:04,613
The demon slayers fight these
demons with mere mortal bodies.

20
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:08,281
As humans, wounds are slow to heal,

21
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:10,989
and their lost limbs are unable to grow back.

22
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:17,167
Nevertheless, they fight to protect and defend humanity.

23
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:32,400
I am a trainer.

24
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:36,200
My job is to teach new swordsmen.

25
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:38,950
There are many other trainers.

26
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:40,448
Each one is different.

27
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:44,049
They all educate their students using their own methods.

28
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:47,606
To complete your training and join the demon slayer corps,

29
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:52,030
you will have to survive the final
selection process on mount Fujikasane,

30
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:56,711
and I decide whether you'll
undertake that challenge or not.

31
00:03:58,684 --> 00:03:59,665
As of today,

32
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:02,474
I'm going to start keeping a journal for Nezuko.

33
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,980
I'm descending the mountain again today.

34
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,979
I'll train so that I can survive
through the final selection.

35
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,653
Day after day, I've made my way down the mountain,

36
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:19,967
and I'm starting to learn how to avoid most of the traps,

37
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:22,822
because I'm much stronger now,

38
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:27,905
and somehow I've gotten even better at
picking up subtle scents than I was before.

39
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:30,814
However...

40
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:35,501
The traps are getting more difficult.

41
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:39,891
I'm starting to think he wants me dead.

42
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:54,441
Today I carried my sword with me down the mountain,

43
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,728
but it made moving a lot harder.

44
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:02,249
The weight's throwing me off.

45
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,262
I get caught in every trap.

46
00:05:06,857 --> 00:05:08,506
991, 992...

47
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:09,998
Today I swung the sword.

48
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,480
Actually, not just today. That's been every day.

49
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,149
As soon as I'm down the mountain,

50
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:17,669
I swing it 'til I feel like my arms'll fall off.

51
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:18,927
1,000!

52
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:21,719
Now do 500 more.

53
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:39,231
Swords are fragile weapons.

54
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,910
That's how my sword training started.

55
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,704
Though strong along the blade's
edge, it's very weak on the sides.

56
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:52,344
So obviously you have to apply
the force where it's strongest.

57
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:55,558
The direction the blade is facing

58
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,212
and the direction you swing have to be exactly the same.

59
00:05:58,756 --> 00:06:00,074
Otherwise, it'll break.

60
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:05,535
Urokodaki told me, "if you ever break your
sword, I'll break every bone in your body."

61
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:09,594
He sounded just like that, too, very ominous.

62
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:15,072
Nezuko.

63
00:06:16,051 --> 00:06:17,807
I have to work hard for her.

64
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,702
Today, I fell down.

65
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:39,149
I'm training to do it as softly as possible

66
00:06:39,227 --> 00:06:41,475
so I can get up quickly from any position.

67
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:46,943
I raise my sword, charge
Mr. Urokodaki, and try to kill him.

68
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:51,384
Meanwhile, he's unarmed, barehanded...

69
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:56,759
But he's ridiculously strong.

70
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:00,904
He throws me over his shoulder
every time, and I roll to the ground.

71
00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:07,780
Nezuko, I'm home.

72
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:21,463
Today's lesson was about breathing
techniques and fighting forms.

73
00:07:22,523 --> 00:07:24,975
Total concentration breathing?

74
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:26,817
That's right.

75
00:07:27,222 --> 00:07:31,664
Also I'm going to teach you how to
use all ten water-breathing forms.

76
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:35,396
Start by taking a long, deep breath

77
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:38,728
so the oxygen flows into every cell of your body.

78
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:41,553
This will enhance your healing ability

79
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,037
and stabilize, as well as energize, your spirit.

80
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:48,571
Now relax your arms and shoulders,

81
00:07:48,762 --> 00:07:51,241
but keep your lower body braced.

82
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:53,544
Good. Now breathe!

83
00:07:58,435 --> 00:07:59,425
Wrong!

84
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:03,722
Next, the forms.

85
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:05,998
Right! How am I doing?

86
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,072
All wrong!

87
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:08,153
How 'bout now?

88
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:09,094
Still wrong!

89
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,720
Now?

90
00:08:09,796 --> 00:08:10,450
Again!

91
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:11,247
Now?

92
00:08:11,298 --> 00:08:11,872
Terrible!

93
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:14,843
I get yelled at for not bracing my stomach

94
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,928
and clobbered to a pulp.

95
00:08:18,658 --> 00:08:22,468
My next lesson, I had to become one with the water.

96
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,396
Get in already.

97
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:33,405
I'm doing this for Nezuko!

98
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,375
Nezuko!

99
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:43,842
I am water!

100
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:51,158
As of now, Nezuko's been asleep
for six months, entire time.

101
00:08:52,202 --> 00:08:56,932
Urokodaki sent for a doctor to come
look at her, but he couldn't find anything.

102
00:08:58,465 --> 00:09:01,546
So why are you still sleeping?

103
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:07,852
I'm scared.

104
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:10,342
I'm worried that,

105
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:13,502
one morning, I'm gonna wake up, and she'll be dead.

106
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:18,199
Every day, that thought haunts me.

107
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:28,907
Coming down the mountain's even tougher now.

108
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,730
I start higher, so the air's even thinner.

109
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:41,930
More than a few times, I thought I was gonna die.

110
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:01,573
That's it. I've taught you all I can.

111
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:06,736
I've been on mount Sagiri for a year, and suddenly this.

112
00:10:08,771 --> 00:10:10,516
The rest is all up to you.

113
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:14,640
You have to prove you're capable
of advancing to the next level.

114
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:20,275
Come with me.

115
00:10:38,873 --> 00:10:40,959
If you can cut this boulder in two,

116
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,069
I'll allow you to enter the final selection.

117
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:50,299
Is that really...

118
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,226
Even possible?

119
00:10:53,547 --> 00:10:55,557
Can a sword cut through that?

120
00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:57,807
I'm gonna fail.

121
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,978
My sword will break.

122
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:08,319
Urokodaki? Hang on a second!

123
00:11:08,562 --> 00:11:09,928
Urokodaki!

124
00:11:11,965 --> 00:11:14,319
After that day, that was it.

125
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:16,819
He never taught me anything again.

126
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:47,996
From then on, I spent every day
practicing what I'd learned from Urokodaki.

127
00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:58,342
All the basics like holding
my breath and staying flexible.

128
00:11:58,476 --> 00:12:00,672
It's a good thing I wrote it all down in this journal.

129
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:13,934
But still, even after six more months,

130
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,775
I can't cut through the boulder.

131
00:12:16,984 --> 00:12:18,223
It's frustrating.

132
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:21,081
Not enough! I'm not training hard enough!

133
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:24,432
I gotta do more! More!

134
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:35,680
Unless, am I no good?

135
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:38,699
Will Nezuko die just like this?

136
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:41,754
I'm about to give up!

137
00:12:41,857 --> 00:12:43,029
It's impossible!

138
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:47,319
Come on, Tanjiro! You can do this!

139
00:12:48,738 --> 00:12:49,898
Silence!

140
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:58,377
It's unseemly to whine, so knock it off.

141
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:01,475
Who's this guy? He has no scent.

142
00:13:01,675 --> 00:13:03,208
And what's with the mask?

143
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:06,805
A demon slayer bears his suffering in silence.

144
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:09,561
Isn't that what you want to be?

145
00:13:11,555 --> 00:13:13,174
Then, start acting like it.

146
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:25,831
You're slow, weak, and immature.

147
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:29,751
That's not what I'd call a demon slayer.

148
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:43,650
What do you think you're doing?!

149
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,185
Trying to figure out what you think you're doing.

150
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,019
What do you mean? I'm training.

151
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:53,519
How long do you plan to keep sitting on your butt?

152
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:55,472
Take a fighting stance.

153
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,813
Come on, then. Give me your best shot.

154
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:05,988
But your sword's made of wood. I could hurt you.

155
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:22,889
How thoughtful of you.

156
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:26,139
I greatly appreciate your concern,

157
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:30,639
but do you honestly think you'd
even be capable of giving me a scratch?

158
00:14:33,192 --> 00:14:35,272
Rest assured, there's nothing to worry about.

159
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:37,522
I'm far more powerful than you are.

160
00:14:37,637 --> 00:14:39,772
I've already cut through my boulder!

161
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:42,033
So it is possible.

162
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:02,079
You obviously haven't learned anything.

163
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:04,860
You haven't mastered any of your training!

164
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:08,309
Especially not total concentration breathing.

165
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:11,059
Didn't Urokodaki teach you?

166
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:15,842
He knows Urokodaki? Who is he?

167
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:20,559
All you've done with your
training is memorize the information.

168
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:24,237
Your body still has no clue what it needs to do.

169
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:28,491
What the hell have you been up
to for the past year and a half?

170
00:15:30,786 --> 00:15:33,680
All of it has to be hammered into your flesh!

171
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:37,751
More! More! More!

172
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,630
You have to make sure you never forget
any of the secrets Urokodaki taught you!

173
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:46,133
Pound it into the marrow of your bones!

174
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:47,554
I'm trying!

175
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,021
I'm giving it all I've got every day!

176
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,846
Except, I'm not getting anywhere!

177
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:55,144
I can't...

178
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,343
I don't think I can do it!

179
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,022
You can! Man up!

180
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:02,590
Don't you want to be a demon slayer?

181
00:16:02,817 --> 00:16:04,943
There's nowhere else to go, but forward!

182
00:16:05,274 --> 00:16:09,194
Give it your all! Show me just what you're capable of!

183
00:16:26,593 --> 00:16:28,213
I'll leave the rest to you.

184
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:42,609
Are you all right?

185
00:16:45,044 --> 00:16:46,859
Please tell me you saw that!

186
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:49,862
The way that guy hit me!

187
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,362
His swing didn't lose an ounce of power.

188
00:16:52,498 --> 00:16:54,130
It was just beautiful.

189
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:56,117
I want to be able to do that!

190
00:16:56,294 --> 00:16:58,389
What do you think? Is that possible?

191
00:17:01,405 --> 00:17:05,045
I'm positive it is, because
I'll be there to look after you.

192
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,184
She's cute.

193
00:17:12,671 --> 00:17:14,458
I'm sorry. Who are you?

194
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:18,839
The girl told me her name was Makomo.

195
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:23,289
And the name of the guy who beat me up was Sabito.

196
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:27,940
Makomo helped guide me by pointing
out everything I was doing wrong.

197
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:31,840
She corrected my unnecessary movements

198
00:17:32,006 --> 00:17:34,201
and all my bad habits,

199
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:37,204
but, when I asked her why she was helping me

200
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,125
and where she came from, she wouldn't say.

201
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,380
Sabito and I,

202
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,380
we both love Urokodaki very much.

203
00:17:46,735 --> 00:17:49,981
She said that a lot, almost like a catchphrase.

204
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:53,092
She and Sabito weren't siblings.

205
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:56,267
They were orphans, and Urokodaki raised them.

206
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,665
We're not alone, though.

207
00:17:58,748 --> 00:18:00,605
There are lots of other children, too.

208
00:18:01,192 --> 00:18:03,224
They're always watching you, Tanjiro.

209
00:18:05,008 --> 00:18:08,065
She is cute, but Makomo's a strange girl.

210
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:11,362
Her speech is so abstract and dreamy.

211
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,698
With total concentration breathing,

212
00:18:15,064 --> 00:18:16,944
your blood circulation accelerates,

213
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,516
because your heart rate is faster than normal.

214
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,009
That causes your body temperature to spike as well,

215
00:18:23,165 --> 00:18:26,378
allowing a human to fight with the strength of a demon...

216
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:30,715
So it's crucial to expand your lung capacity.

217
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,470
By introducing lots of air
into your bloodstream all at once,

218
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:41,436
your blood gets excited, so your bones and
muscles start to heat up and grow stronger.

219
00:18:42,502 --> 00:18:44,507
None of that makes sense.

220
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,421
So how do I learn that?

221
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,557
Train until it kills you,

222
00:18:52,854 --> 00:18:56,664
because really, when you get down to
it, there's nothing else you can do.

223
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:03,498
So I trained 'til my arms and legs wanted to fall off.

224
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,851
'Til my lungs and heart felt
like they were going to burst,

225
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:08,631
I swung my sword.

226
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:10,588
But still...

227
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:13,731
Sabito kept beating me.

228
00:19:16,463 --> 00:19:19,352
Six months later, that changed.

229
00:19:27,652 --> 00:19:30,237
Once again, I challenged him to a duel,

230
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:32,716
but, this time, his sword was real.

231
00:19:33,597 --> 00:19:35,492
It took you six months,

232
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,492
but you look like you finally belong.

233
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:48,656
This is the day I win!

234
00:19:56,386 --> 00:19:58,546
A head-to-head fight like this is simple.

235
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:02,513
Whoever's stronger and faster comes out on top.

236
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:17,988
It was all over in an instant.

237
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:22,285
Today, in a fraction of a second,

238
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:26,101
for the first time, my blade struck first.

239
00:20:36,675 --> 00:20:40,400
As soon as I'd won, Sabito smiled.

240
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,162
He looked happy, but also sad.

241
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:46,844
It was a smile of relief.

242
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,934
Tanjiro...

243
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:52,663
You did just great.

244
00:20:53,108 --> 00:20:54,973
Never forget about this.

245
00:20:56,949 --> 00:20:59,039
Keep winning for me, Tanjiro,

246
00:20:59,353 --> 00:21:00,783
the next one, too.

247
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,541
Next thing I knew, Sabito was gone.

248
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:17,041
I was sure what my sword cut through was his mask.

249
00:21:24,591 --> 00:21:25,557
But no.

250
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:27,488
It was the boulder.
