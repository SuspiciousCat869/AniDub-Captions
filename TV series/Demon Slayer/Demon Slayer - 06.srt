1
00:00:08,721 --> 00:00:10,138
Are you finished changing?

2
00:00:10,763 --> 00:00:11,504
Yes.

3
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:12,611
Tanjiro...

4
00:02:13,564 --> 00:02:16,943
Now that you have officially
become a demon slayer swordsman,

5
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:19,434
I would like to explain a few things.

6
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:20,809
Right.

7
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:22,449
First,

8
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:25,015
the demon slayer corps uniform you're wearing

9
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:27,698
is made with a special kind of fiber.

10
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,657
It's lightweight, water resistant, and nonflammable.

11
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:37,253
A low-level demon's fangs and talons
are incapable of penetrating that fabric.

12
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:39,795
It's that strong?

13
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:41,652
Impressive, hmm?

14
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,373
Now, as for the nichirin sword,

15
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,267
its color varies from owner to owner,

16
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:50,029
and each hue has its own unique traits.

17
00:02:50,423 --> 00:02:54,539
However, there aren't many
demon slayers with black blades,

18
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:56,827
so little is known about them.

19
00:02:57,087 --> 00:02:59,808
Some believe they're a bad omen.

20
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:03,330
What does that mean, "bad omen"? How so?

21
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:10,442
Black blades are rumored to only be wielded by a
swordsman who has little chance of going very far.

22
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:12,835
Oh, well.

23
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,940
I don't care if I'm destined for greatness,

24
00:03:16,482 --> 00:03:19,672
because, no matter what, I'll turn Nezuko back.

25
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,001
Yes, you will.

26
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,525
I have no doubt you'll make that happen.

27
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:26,811
Thank you.

28
00:03:27,913 --> 00:03:30,288
One last thing. Here.

29
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:34,367
A box to carry your sister during the day,

30
00:03:34,877 --> 00:03:38,632
built from a very light wood called kirikumo cedar.

31
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:43,342
It's been coated in rock lacquer to reinforce the exterior

32
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:45,150
and make it even more durable.

33
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:47,139
Thanks, Urokodaki.

34
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:49,309
Oh, wow!

35
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,176
You weren't kidding! It is light!

36
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,806
Nezuko, hop in for a ride.

37
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,737
Pretty please?

38
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:22,779
Nezuko, from now on, we'll always be together.

39
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,627
Okay. I'm off.

40
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:32,514
Before you go...

41
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:05,638
Nezuko, how you doing?

42
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:13,078
Nezuko?

43
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:20,347
This is only a guess, but I believe
Nezuko can recover her strength by sleeping,

44
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:24,690
instead of consuming human flesh as other demons do.

45
00:05:31,438 --> 00:05:34,822
Okay. Rest up, Nezuko.

46
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:53,833
A town to the northwest.

47
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,321
Looks like I found it.

48
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:22,710
Oh, look. There's Kazumi.

49
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:25,689
Poor thing. He doesn't look good.

50
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:29,697
Eh?

51
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:34,758
Well, he was right next to Satoko when she was taken.

52
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:44,906
It's happening every night.

53
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:45,848
It's very creepy.

54
00:06:46,225 --> 00:06:48,596
Tragic. Dreadful!

55
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:51,606
As soon as night falls, another girl will be abducted.

56
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:57,227
Mr. Kazumi!

57
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,520
I want to hear what happened last night from you.

58
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:15,612
This is where Satoko vanished,

59
00:07:16,982 --> 00:07:19,522
but I'm sure you don't believe me.

60
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:22,093
I do believe you.

61
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:23,773
I'm here to help.

62
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:27,064
Now let's see!

63
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:39,877
There's still a faint scent of the demon here...

64
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:42,734
But it's uneven.

65
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,992
Something's off.

66
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,051
Who is this kid, anyway?

67
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:02,150
How dare you?!

68
00:08:04,537 --> 00:08:05,749
You lost her?!

69
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:07,642
You bastard!

70
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:10,247
That's enough! Honey, please, stop!

71
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,240
I want you to believe me.

72
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,249
She really did just vanish.

73
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:07,828
I know.

74
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:11,672
That's why I came here, so I can stop this.

75
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:19,802
Are you really gonna keep going?

76
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:21,122
Yes.

77
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:23,557
Come on. It's getting late.

78
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:28,929
I'm flattered that you're so concerned
about this, but shouldn't you rest,

79
00:09:28,954 --> 00:09:30,762
maybe pick it up again in the morning?

80
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:35,016
They're only active at night...

81
00:09:35,995 --> 00:09:38,296
So there's no time for rest.

82
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,541
Got something.

83
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,076
There's a new scent in the area.

84
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,404
It's nearby. It won't be long now.

85
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,877
Wait a second.

86
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:50,048
Don't tell me you're a...

87
00:09:50,518 --> 00:09:52,002
are you a...

88
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:00,908
It's terrifying.

89
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:04,934
I want you to stay indoors, where you'll be safe.

90
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:06,345
I will, mother.

91
00:10:07,267 --> 00:10:09,022
Good night. I'm going to bed.

92
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:24,326
I wonder what happened to the girls who disappeared.

93
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,303
I hope they're all right.

94
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:08,705
Hey, wait! Where are you going?!

95
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,088
So fast.

96
00:12:12,142 --> 00:12:13,596
The scent got stronger!

97
00:12:14,221 --> 00:12:15,497
The demon's active!

98
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:20,979
How'd he do that?

99
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,381
He said, "demon."

100
00:12:24,271 --> 00:12:26,316
Demon? Then he's...

101
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:40,718
This is it. They're right here.

102
00:12:46,581 --> 00:12:50,258
Two scents... one demon, one human girl.

103
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:54,430
I don't see them.

104
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,973
Although...

105
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:08,348
The scent is strongest right...

106
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,248
Here!

107
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,158
The demon has powers!

108
00:13:37,704 --> 00:13:39,211
The blood demon art

109
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:43,062
is a special spell that some use to give them abilities.

110
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:47,536
You may end up having to face some
of them in the near future as well.

111
00:13:51,618 --> 00:13:53,967
What did you do with the girls you kidnapped?!

112
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,120
There are some things I wanna know!

113
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,073
Who was that?

114
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:13,687
I need your help.

115
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,378
Hold her for me, and stay close.

116
00:14:17,185 --> 00:14:19,487
As long as you do that, I can protect you!

117
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,943
The ground, the wall,

118
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:27,465
I bet it could come from just about anywhere.

119
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,089
I wouldn't be surprised if it
could appear out of thin air.

120
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,763
Doesn't matter, because, even if it's submerged,

121
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:41,436
it can't erase its scent.

122
00:14:46,212 --> 00:14:46,746
Now.

123
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,986
Water breathing! Fifth form!

124
00:14:54,368 --> 00:14:55,221
There are more!

125
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:00,606
Take it easy.

126
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:02,274
You've got this!

127
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:04,254
Eighth form!

128
00:15:06,392 --> 00:15:07,864
Waterfall basin!

129
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:24,953
Tanjiro, listen to me closely.

130
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:31,116
There's only one demon that has the kind
of blood that can turn a human, just one,

131
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,844
that's it, in the entire world.

132
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,484
Just one?

133
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:39,420
The first demon there ever was.

134
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:42,553
He's been here for more than a thousand years.

135
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:46,471
He's your target, the one who attacked your family.

136
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:49,926
More importantly, I believe he's also the one

137
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:53,508
who might know how to turn your sister back into a human.

138
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,824
That demon's name is...

139
00:16:02,849 --> 00:16:04,964
Muzan Kibutsuji.

140
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:08,108
Eighth form! Waterfall basin!

141
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:11,960
I missed.

142
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:14,643
I missed all the vulnerable spots,

143
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:17,653
because I switched forms midway through.

144
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,973
They all have the same exact scent.

145
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,733
Usually, demons don't work together.

146
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,681
Which means one demon has split into three.

147
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:40,015
I have to take them all out

148
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,742
and still protect these two.

149
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:43,480
Don't lose your nerve.

150
00:16:43,706 --> 00:16:45,297
Make him talk to you

151
00:16:45,498 --> 00:16:47,398
about Muzan Kibutsuji

152
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:51,175
and about how to turn a demon back into a human!

153
00:16:53,085 --> 00:16:54,430
Total concentration.

154
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:56,835
Water breathing!

155
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:01,054
Second form! Water wheel!

156
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:05,737
Missed again.

157
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,269
I can't chase him,

158
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:20,124
and I can't take a full swing while
I'm protecting these two, either.

159
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:22,883
Bastard!

160
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,115
She'll go stale!

161
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,752
Move out of the way, you little punk!

162
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:32,887
The girl's 16 already. She's losing flavor by the second!

163
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:36,225
If I don't eat her soon, there won't be any left at all!

164
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:43,653
Take a breath, other me.

165
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:46,403
Calm down. No big deal.

166
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,046
Nights like this happen, right?

167
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:53,276
I've already feasted on plenty
of this town's 16-year-old girls,

168
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,855
and every one of them was meaty and delicious.

169
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,083
I am satisfied with that.

170
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:01,965
Well, I'm not satisfied at all, other me!

171
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:05,312
I want to devour all of them!

172
00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:06,719
You monster!

173
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:08,518
Bring Satoko back,

174
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:10,182
the girl you took the other night!

175
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:21,590
Satoko?

176
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:24,663
Which one was that?

177
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:32,742
If her hairpin is in this collection,
then I'm afraid I've already eaten her.

178
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:34,214
Sorry.

179
00:19:18,618 --> 00:19:20,017
I missed again.

180
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:21,678
He moves so fast!

181
00:19:23,022 --> 00:19:25,775
Oh, crap! I'm too close to the wall!

182
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:44,945
Why in the world would a demon
be traveling with a mere human?

183
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:51,043
What's the meaning of this?

184
00:19:51,068 --> 00:19:52,523
Who are these two?

185
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:56,799
Why would a swordsman and demon be working together?

186
00:20:03,783 --> 00:20:05,981
It doesn't make any sense.

187
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:53,018
Nezuko.

188
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:01,383
I don't know if this will be of any comfort or not,

189
00:21:01,534 --> 00:21:03,473
but while Nezuko was asleep,

190
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,521
I used hypnotic suggestion on her.

191
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:07,954
What for?

192
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,286
I convinced her that all humans are her family.

193
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,865
I told her to protect them.

194
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,287
"The demons are your enemies."

195
00:21:23,563 --> 00:21:24,483
Nezuko!

196
00:21:24,508 --> 00:21:26,570
"If a demon harms a human,

197
00:21:26,806 --> 00:21:28,590
never forgive them!"
