1
00:00:00,937 --> 00:00:02,734
South-southeast!

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:05,886
The next place you need to go is south-southeast!

3
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:07,740
I heard you!

4
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:10,208
You don't have to keep squawking it at me, okay?

5
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:13,855
I'm begging you! I got the message, so be quiet!

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,159
Please!

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,179
Please! Please! Please!

8
00:00:19,204 --> 00:00:21,090
Please marry me!

9
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:24,325
You know I could die any day now!

10
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,904
Marry me so I don't die alone!

11
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:29,993
Marry me! I'm begging you, please!

12
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:32,265
Wh-what is he doing?

13
00:00:33,069 --> 00:00:34,104
What on earth?

14
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,708
Uh, yes?

15
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:25,259
Come on! I'm begging you!

16
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,346
There's no one else!

17
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:28,586
You're the only hope that I have left!

18
00:02:29,423 --> 00:02:30,897
So that's it, then.

19
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:32,468
Okay, I'll try to help.

20
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:39,328
Please! I'm asking you again! Marry me! I beg you!

21
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:43,412
Why are you making such a scene in the middle of the road?

22
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,453
She's clearly not interested in you!

23
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,939
Also, you're stressing your sparrow out!

24
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:49,892
Wait. That uniform.

25
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:52,488
Aren't you that guy from final selection?

26
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:55,691
Don't go pretending like we know
each other, cause we don't, 'kay?!

27
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,061
Huh?! But we have met!

28
00:02:58,162 --> 00:03:02,505
Don't you remember?! Don't get angry at me
when you're the one with the terrible memory!

29
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,804
All right. You're all set to head home again.

30
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,699
Do you need help with anything else?

31
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:17,573
No. Thank you very much.

32
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:18,920
Hang on!

33
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,579
Don't you interfere!

34
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,280
That girl is madly in love with me!

35
00:03:22,305 --> 00:03:25,081
The two of us are gonna get marrie...

36
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,524
Aah! Hey! Ouch! That hurts!

37
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:31,304
Aah! Aah! Stop! Ow! Ow!

38
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:33,302
Hey, calm down!

39
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:37,534
When did I say anything even resembling that I loved you?!

40
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:40,069
All I did was come talk to you while you were crumpled up

41
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,764
all disheveled on the side of the road!

42
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,970
Huh?! No!

43
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:47,991
So are you telling me the reason you did that
wasn't because you were falling in love with me?

44
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:52,148
Considering that I already have a fiance,
that's exactly what I've been trying to tell you!

45
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,792
Well, you seem to be perfectly fine now, so goodbye!

46
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:58,785
W-wait! Come back! Please...

47
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,338
Would you give it a rest already?

48
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:02,581
Wh-why did you have to get in my way?

49
00:04:02,713 --> 00:04:04,644
This had nothing to do with you.

50
00:04:05,331 --> 00:04:07,139
Why are you looking at me like that?

51
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:12,529
Stop it! You're staring at me like I'm
some sort of pitiful creature or something!

52
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:18,204
Now listen here, you! The reason I missed
out on getting married is all your fault!

53
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:24,352
Say something, would you?!

54
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,492
Look, during my next job, I'll likely die.

55
00:04:28,695 --> 00:04:32,452
The reason is I'm just a weakling. Do you understand?

56
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:35,726
You have to help protect me until
I manage to get married, mister.

57
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:38,503
My name's Tanjiro. And you are?

58
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:40,296
Tanjiro? That's good to know.

59
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,209
I'm Zenitsu Agatsuma.

60
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:44,551
Please, you've gotta do what you can to save me.

61
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:47,248
Aren't you being a bit dramatic?

62
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:49,524
Why did you even become a swordsman?

63
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:51,881
You're acting utterly pathetic right now.

64
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:53,385
That's a harsh way to put it!

65
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,275
I got conned by a woman and racked up a lot of debt!

66
00:04:56,322 --> 00:05:00,452
The old geezer who took it over for me
happened to be this tough-as-nails instructor!

67
00:05:00,477 --> 00:05:02,538
He made me train to the bone every day!

68
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:05,066
It was so hellish, I just wanted to die!

69
00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:07,732
I was hoping that'd happen during final selection!

70
00:05:07,852 --> 00:05:11,313
But, since I survived, this
nightmare continues to haunt me!

71
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:14,042
Agh! I'm so scared, terrified, frightened!

72
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:17,357
I just know I'm gonna get eaten by a demon soon!

73
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:20,879
My brains are gonna get sucked
through my ears while I'm still alive!

74
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,815
Yaaah!

75
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:24,640
No!

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,443
Please save me!

77
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:29,701
Hey, are you okay?

78
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:49,029
You better?

79
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:53,008
A bit, but now I'm feeling really hungry.

80
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:55,690
Don't you have any food or rations on you?

81
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:56,771
No.

82
00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:02,703
Here. Take one of these.

83
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:04,735
Really?

84
00:06:05,163 --> 00:06:06,482
Thank you so much.

85
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,970
Aren't you gonna eat anything?

86
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:16,484
Um, that was all I had.

87
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:26,693
Hey, uh, you take this half.

88
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:29,546
You sure about that? Thanks a lot.

89
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:49,525
I know what you mean when you
say that you're terrified of demons,

90
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,864
but you should try not to worry your sparrow.

91
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:52,936
Hah?

92
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:56,532
You're saying it was distressed? How could you tell?

93
00:06:56,859 --> 00:07:01,243
Let's see. He says you're always
whining about not wanting to go to work,

94
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:04,450
and you're always hitting on
girls, and you snore really loudly.

95
00:07:04,694 --> 00:07:06,319
Yup, that covers it.

96
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:09,565
Wait. He said all that?

97
00:07:09,765 --> 00:07:11,790
You can understand bird language?

98
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:12,385
Yeah.

99
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:14,979
No way! You've gotta be lying to me!

100
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:19,062
Start running! Start running!

101
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:22,050
Run, Tanjiro! Run, Zenitsu!

102
00:07:22,217 --> 00:07:25,227
Both of you must head to your next destination!

103
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:28,157
Run, Tanjiro! Run, Zenitsu!

104
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:34,888
That crow is talking to us!

105
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:48,809
Hey, Tanjiro, maybe I should just hang back for now.

106
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:52,908
Even if I tag along with you, I'm
not gonna be able to do anything.

107
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,293
The scent of demons is getting stronger.

108
00:07:56,873 --> 00:07:58,373
There's something up ahead.

109
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:02,498
A house?

110
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:15,040
I can smell blood, but it's strange.

111
00:08:15,606 --> 00:08:17,845
Wait. You can smell something here?

112
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:20,595
Yeah, but this is a whole new smell.

113
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:23,619
A smell? I can't say I'm getting that.

114
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:27,108
What about that sound? You're able to hear that, right?

115
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:28,626
Sound?

116
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:37,495
There are kids here?

117
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:38,775
They look scared.

118
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:41,237
Hey, there.

119
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:43,834
Is there a reason you're out here by yourselves?

120
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:51,406
They're definitely terrified.

121
00:08:52,592 --> 00:08:55,967
Guess what. I have got something really cool here.

122
00:08:55,992 --> 00:08:56,780
Wanna see it?

123
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,441
Ta-da!

124
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:01,095
It's a friendly sparrow.

125
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:06,222
See? Isn't he cute?

126
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:18,476
Talk to me. Did something happen?

127
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,310
Is this your house?

128
00:09:20,956 --> 00:09:22,456
No. No, it's not.

129
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:25,038
This is... this house is...

130
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:27,752
It... it belongs to a...

131
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,363
Monster.

132
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,805
Our big brother got taken away.

133
00:09:35,595 --> 00:09:39,523
We were walking down the road at night,
and this thing appeared in front of us.

134
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:43,780
It went straight for our
brother, never giving us a glance.

135
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:46,743
Did it take him into that house?

136
00:09:47,242 --> 00:09:48,947
Yeah. That's right.

137
00:09:49,725 --> 00:09:51,550
So you two followed them here?

138
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:53,876
That's real brave. Great job.

139
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:58,406
We used the traces of his blood to follow them.

140
00:09:58,596 --> 00:10:00,025
That thing really hurt him.

141
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:02,050
I see.

142
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:04,675
It'll be all right.

143
00:10:04,762 --> 00:10:06,537
We're gonna go defeat the bad guy

144
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:07,997
and save your brother.

145
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:10,846
Is that true? You'll help him?

146
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:13,648
Yes. I promise.

147
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:15,473
Hey, Tanjiro.

148
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:16,045
Huh?

149
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:18,833
Uh, what is that strange sound?

150
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:22,018
It's really unnerving and never stops.

151
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:24,667
It sounds like a drum.

152
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:26,644
A drum?

153
00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:29,041
I don't hear anything.

154
00:10:56,914 --> 00:10:58,152
Just cover your eyes!

155
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,264
Are you all right?

156
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:05,854
Can you hear me? Just hang on!

157
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:10,188
This is bad. The wound is so deep.

158
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:14,832
Even though I was able to...

159
00:11:17,473 --> 00:11:24,892
escape from that horrible place, and make it here...

160
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:29,297
was it not enough?

161
00:11:29,932 --> 00:11:32,403
Am I still gonna die?

162
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:50,355
He's gone.

163
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:53,689
I'm sorry you had to suffer like that.

164
00:11:56,446 --> 00:11:57,573
Tanjiro...

165
00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:01,238
By any chance, would that happen to be these kids'...

166
00:12:27,735 --> 00:12:29,210
We couldn't save him.

167
00:12:31,056 --> 00:12:33,401
If we'd only gotten here a little sooner,

168
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:35,348
things might have been different.

169
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:40,000
Uh, hey, is this your brother?

170
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:41,662
No.

171
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:43,663
No, that isn't him.

172
00:12:44,341 --> 00:12:47,410
He was wearing an orange-colored kimono.

173
00:12:49,063 --> 00:12:49,975
I see.

174
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:52,555
So it's captured more than one person.

175
00:12:55,096 --> 00:12:57,430
I promise to bury you once I return.

176
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,675
Until then, please forgive me.

177
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,896
All right. Zenitsu, let's go!

178
00:13:09,574 --> 00:13:11,598
Look, the only people who can help them

179
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:13,074
are you and me now.

180
00:13:19,454 --> 00:13:22,489
All right, then. Have it your way.

181
00:13:23,894 --> 00:13:27,355
Hey! Tanjiro, don't be so scary!

182
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,666
Fine! I give in! You win! I'll come along with you, okay?!

183
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:33,916
Don't let me force you.

184
00:13:34,632 --> 00:13:37,868
I said I'll go!

185
00:13:41,707 --> 00:13:44,954
In case you run into trouble, I'm leaving this box.

186
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:47,998
If you need help, it'll protect you.

187
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:50,857
Okay. We'll be back.

188
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,099
So, Tanjiro,

189
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:27,405
hey, before we continue,

190
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:29,272
whatever's in this place with us,

191
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:31,846
you'll be sure to protect me from it, won't you?

192
00:14:33,765 --> 00:14:34,860
Zenitsu,

193
00:14:34,985 --> 00:14:39,177
I hate to have to tell you this, but, in my last fight,

194
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:40,858
I broke a leg and a rib.

195
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,987
Neither of them have fully healed up as of yet, so...

196
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:48,247
Wait! What?! You have broken bones?!

197
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:50,122
What do you think you're trying to do to me?!

198
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:53,001
If you're in that condition, my fate has been sealed!

199
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:55,409
I'm gonna d-d-d-die!

200
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:58,645
This is awful! What am I gonna do? I'm finished!

201
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,270
It's all over for me! Yaah!

202
00:15:01,495 --> 00:15:03,295
I can't believe you have broken bones!

203
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,847
I'm a dead man now, completely and utterly dead!

204
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,647
I'm dead! I'm dead...

205
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:10,012
Zenitsu, you've gotta calm down. You'll be all right.

206
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:12,882
Don't feed me your empty promises!

207
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:16,508
No, it's true. You're gonna be fine, because you're...

208
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:17,724
Stay away!

209
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,800
You two shouldn't be here!

210
00:15:20,848 --> 00:15:22,381
W-we're sorry.

211
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,144
There were sounds coming from inside that box.

212
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:28,704
Still, I really wish you hadn't left it behind.

213
00:15:28,786 --> 00:15:31,521
That thing is more precious to me than my own life.

214
00:15:41,402 --> 00:15:42,584
Oops! Sorry.

215
00:15:53,975 --> 00:15:55,186
The room changed.

216
00:15:55,868 --> 00:16:00,187
Or could it be that we somehow
moved during the beat of that drum?

217
00:16:04,153 --> 00:16:06,823
Sorry you got separated from your brother,

218
00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:10,126
but I'm gonna protect you, no matter what.

219
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:14,573
And Zenitsu is going to protect your brother. Don't worry.

220
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:16,384
What's your name?

221
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:18,361
It's Teruko.

222
00:16:18,903 --> 00:16:20,391
Your name's Teruko?

223
00:16:20,642 --> 00:16:22,407
Your parents picked out a really...

224
00:16:36,452 --> 00:16:38,907
Among all the different scents in this mansion,

225
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,847
this is the strongest one.

226
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:42,844
It's eaten so many.

227
00:16:43,764 --> 00:16:46,566
This one has to be the master of this place.

228
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:49,992
I'm gonna die!

229
00:16:50,017 --> 00:16:53,002
It's over! It's over! It's
over! It's over! I just know it!

230
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:55,907
I can't believe Tanjiro and I got separated!

231
00:16:55,993 --> 00:16:57,329
Teruko, you here?

232
00:16:57,411 --> 00:16:58,188
It's Shoichi!

233
00:16:58,213 --> 00:16:59,381
Hey, hey, hey!

234
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:01,257
You can't go around yelling like that!

235
00:17:01,326 --> 00:17:03,126
If the bad guy hears you and finds us,

236
00:17:03,151 --> 00:17:06,566
it's not gonna be pretty! Let's just go wait outside!

237
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:07,155
Hah?

238
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:08,841
Why would we do that?

239
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:11,252
Are you trying to escape all by yourself?

240
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,040
All this constant whining about dying,

241
00:17:14,162 --> 00:17:15,554
aren't you a little ashamed?

242
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,757
It's pathetic that you're clinging to the
sleeve of someone who's younger than you.

243
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:23,554
Why does a coward like you have a
sword on your hip in the first place?

244
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:29,221
Those words... They cut me right to my core.

245
00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:34,333
Listen here, you! I'm not gonna be useful here, anyway...

246
00:17:34,414 --> 00:17:37,542
So I'm just gonna go find an adult who can help us, okay?

247
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:41,346
This isn't something us kids can resolve on our own.

248
00:17:47,144 --> 00:17:49,354
No way! You've gotta be kidding me!

249
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:51,179
How's this not the front door?!

250
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,950
Did I misremember? I was sure it was here!

251
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:54,981
This one?

252
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:56,419
Maybe here!

253
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:57,781
Or here!

254
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:13,977
It's a monster!

255
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:29,569
What the heck?! What's with that look?! S-Stop it!

256
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:41,847
If it hadn't been for them,

257
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:45,112
if it hadn't been for them and their meddling...

258
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:47,310
Teruko...

259
00:18:47,514 --> 00:18:49,060
You gotta try not to scream.

260
00:18:49,704 --> 00:18:53,210
The room might change again, so don't go far, all right?

261
00:18:53,624 --> 00:18:55,392
Go hide behind those shelves.

262
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,506
Curses. Curses!

263
00:19:03,704 --> 00:19:06,498
Thanks to them, he was able to get away.

264
00:19:06,674 --> 00:19:09,235
That prey was mine and mine alone.

265
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:15,591
Damn them. Why do all these unwelcome
guests keep barging into someone else's home?

266
00:19:15,975 --> 00:19:17,242
It's maddening.

267
00:19:17,665 --> 00:19:19,805
That prey belonged to me.

268
00:19:19,965 --> 00:19:23,841
I found it with my own two hands on my own property.

269
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,317
Those filthy rats.

270
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,245
I'll make them pay.

271
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:35,116
Hey, you, listen up!

272
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:39,880
I'm a demon slayer, rank mizunoto, Tanjiro Kamado!

273
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,251
It's my duty to slay you now!

274
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:46,106
A child with Marechi that I found myself!

275
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,877
Got him.

276
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,383
Teruko!

277
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,356
I thought this might happen.

278
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:07,356
The room's been flipped.

279
00:20:08,086 --> 00:20:10,353
So this is his blood demon art.

280
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:13,209
This entire mansion is his territory.

281
00:20:15,171 --> 00:20:16,106
What's this?

282
00:20:16,427 --> 00:20:19,562
There's an odd scent, but it's not a demon.

283
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:25,611
Better watch out, 'cause, ready or not,

284
00:20:25,828 --> 00:20:28,180
here I come!

285
00:20:36,364 --> 00:20:37,634
Who is this guy?

286
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:39,634
He's wearing a boar's hide.

287
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:45,884
And he's wielding nichirin swords.

288
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:51,134
All right, you monster,

289
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,237
die on the battlefield, and serve as my catalyst

290
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:58,151
so that I may become even more
powerful and soar to new heights!

291
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,552
Infuriating.

292
00:21:00,848 --> 00:21:02,435
Just infuriating!

293
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:06,263
Hope you're ready for me,

294
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,090
'cause I'm comin' through!
