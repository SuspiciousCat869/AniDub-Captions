1
00:00:05,334 --> 00:00:06,876
Come on out, demon.

2
00:00:08,035 --> 00:00:09,481
Stop it!

3
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:12,489
It's the human blood you love so much!

4
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:14,218
What's the matter? Go on. You know you want it.

5
00:02:22,277 --> 00:02:27,254
Iguro, you're being too rough. Ease up a bit, will you?

6
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:30,795
I'm only doing this because he's trying to escape.

7
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:40,304
Tanjiro, if you use any breathing techniques while
your lungs are squeezed, it'll force your veins to burst.

8
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:45,980
His veins will burst?! I like it!
Sounds dramatic! Come on! Show me!

9
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:56,995
What a poor soul. My heart goes out to
this unfortunate child. Namu amida butsu...

10
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,841
Tanjiro!

11
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:23,394
Nezuko!

12
00:03:35,864 --> 00:03:38,832
She's my sister! I was taking her to get help!

13
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:43,644
I don't know how it happened, but
Nezuko is different from the others!

14
00:04:07,618 --> 00:04:10,386
I convinced her that all humans are her family.

15
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:20,681
I told her to protect them.

16
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:32,804
Humans are to be protected and saved.

17
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:37,398
Never hurt them. I will never hurt them.

18
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:50,594
Hmph!

19
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,077
Tell me what happened.

20
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,608
The demon girl turned her head away in disgust.

21
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,942
Despite Shinazugawa stabbing her three times

22
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:16,473
and then flaunting his bloody arm in front of
her face, she restrained herself from biting him.

23
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:24,496
There it is, undeniable proof
that Nezuko won't attack humans.

24
00:05:28,714 --> 00:05:31,252
What do you think you're doing, Tomioka?

25
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:33,809
Tanjiro...

26
00:05:35,606 --> 00:05:39,992
I'm sure that, even after this, there
are some who can not accept Nezuko.

27
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:43,460
Work towards changing their minds.

28
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:50,631
Prove to them that you and Nezuko can be
helpful to our cause by fighting as demon slayers.

29
00:05:54,652 --> 00:05:59,626
What is this I'm feeling? It's like I'm floating.

30
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:05,055
His voice... Is it because of this
man's voice that my body feels light?

31
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:09,433
Go out and defeat a Twelve Kizuki.

32
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:12,399
Do that, and you will be accepted by all.

33
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,847
Your words will carry more weight as a result.

34
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:26,474
All right. My sister and I... Will defeat Kibutsuji!

35
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,068
Rest assured, we will strike him down
and stop this endless cycle of misery!

36
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,960
That is a bit ambitious for you two.

37
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:40,288
Let's start by defeating a Twelve Kizuki first.

38
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:42,616
Yes, sir.

39
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,775
You mustn't laugh, Mitsuri. Keep it together.

40
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:52,511
It goes without saying that the Hashira of
the Demon Slayer Corps have phenomenal skills.

41
00:06:53,479 --> 00:07:00,349
They have trained themselves to the brink of death and
have defeated it, as well as those of the Twelve Kizuki.

42
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:02,843
Yes! A noble pursuit!

43
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:07,365
That is why the Hashira receive
respect and favorable treatment,

44
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,660
so it would be best for you to mind
your manners when addressing them, Tanjiro.

45
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:13,938
Yes, sir.

46
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:23,197
Also, Sanemi, Obanai, don't
torment the younger ones too much.

47
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:25,387
As you wish.

48
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:30,252
As you wish.

49
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:34,355
We have concluded our business with you, Tanjiro.

50
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:35,984
You may step back.

51
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:42,960
If that's the case, master, allow
me to take Tanjiro into my abode.

52
00:07:47,772 --> 00:07:50,019
All right, then! Take them away, please!

53
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,261
Pardon me for cutting in front!

54
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,975
Now then, let us begin the Hashira meeting.

55
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,476
Hold on just a second, if you would!

56
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:16,353
Come back here!

57
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:23,010
Please, allow me to head-butt that man covered in scars!

58
00:08:23,891 --> 00:08:25,131
I need to do it!

59
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:26,660
Quiet! Keep your mouth shut!

60
00:08:26,662 --> 00:08:29,574
One head-butt for every time he stabbed Nezuko!

61
00:08:29,964 --> 00:08:33,404
Show me where it says you're not
allowed to head-butt another Demon Slayer!

62
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,580
Be silent! Settle down now!

63
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:37,182
Let go of me!

64
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:37,945
Cut it out!

65
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,427
You're not allowed to interrupt the master, all right?

66
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,484
We beg your pardon!

67
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:53,684
Yes, yes! Please forgive us! Master Tokito...

68
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:56,296
We're very sorry! Our sincerest apologies!

69
00:08:56,321 --> 00:09:00,811
Muichiro! What a fine boy! So impressive!

70
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:02,983
Just leave now.

71
00:09:03,306 --> 00:09:04,016
Yes, sir!

72
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:09,576
Tanjiro...

73
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:12,557
Give Tamayo my regards.

74
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,847
Hold on a second. Did I just hear him mention miss Tamayo?

75
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,451
Don't you say another word!

76
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:25,864
We got scolded because of you!

77
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,798
I thought I was gonna wet myself!

78
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:30,776
You don't know how terrifying the Hashira are!

79
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:32,405
Try to read the room next time!

80
00:09:32,592 --> 00:09:34,637
I will never forgive you!

81
00:09:34,735 --> 00:09:35,796
Neither will I!

82
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,576
Apologize to us!

83
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:40,100
Yeah! Apologize!

84
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:42,867
I-I'm sorry.

85
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:54,952
Hello! Anyone home?

86
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:59,271
Is there anyone here?

87
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:00,707
Is there any...

88
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:04,840
No one's coming to the door, huh?

89
00:10:06,226 --> 00:10:07,927
Let's go check out the yard.

90
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,802
Hey, walk on your own two feet.

91
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:18,468
Mm, sorry. It's just my whole body's aching up a storm.

92
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,730
And I thought the headquarters were big,
but this mansion's in a league of its own, huh?

93
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:33,891
That's right. Wasn't this place
called the butterfly mansion?

94
00:10:40,163 --> 00:10:43,522
Well, would you look at that? There is someone here.

95
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:47,496
That would be, um...

96
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:49,842
Oh, right! The Tsuguko.

97
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:52,606
I believe her name is...

98
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:53,659
A "Tsuguko"?

99
00:10:54,464 --> 00:10:56,434
Lady Kanao Tsuyuri.

100
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:05,689
It's that girl from final selection.

101
00:11:07,277 --> 00:11:11,937
From what I was told, she stomped you
real good last night. You don't remember that?

102
00:11:13,937 --> 00:11:17,073
A Tsuguko is a Swordsman trained by a Hashira.

103
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,273
Only those with impressive skill are chosen.

104
00:11:21,488 --> 00:11:23,449
Don't let her being a girl fool you.

105
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:28,336
Please forgive us, lady Tsuyuri.

106
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:31,296
We were ordered to come here by lady Kocho.

107
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,653
Permission to enter the mansion, ma'am.

108
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,151
Uh, if that's all right?

109
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:50,116
You don't mind, do you?

110
00:11:50,912 --> 00:11:52,114
Who are all of you?!

111
00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:54,743
We're here on behalf of...

112
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:55,946
Lady Kocho!

113
00:11:56,627 --> 00:11:58,367
That boy is injured, correct?

114
00:11:58,733 --> 00:11:59,761
You're the Kakushi.

115
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,007
Please come this way.

116
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:04,166
Y-yes, ma'am!

117
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,866
She's fast.

118
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:18,199
Five times?! I gotta take this five times a day?!

119
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:23,338
And I have to keep taking it for three
months?! It's such a horribly bitter taste, too!

120
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:27,159
I'm not gonna want to eat a
single thing after taking that!

121
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:32,556
You're telling me that my arms and legs will be
restored just by taking this medicine?! Really?!

122
00:12:32,588 --> 00:12:34,071
Would you please stop shouting?

123
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:38,398
Explain to me how that's gonna
work! I don't understand at all!

124
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:40,475
Still making a fuss, even now?

125
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:43,448
...Forget even just one time?! Huh?! Huh?!

126
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,331
What'll happen to my arms and legs?!

127
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:46,238
Zenitsu!

128
00:12:46,436 --> 00:12:47,227
Tell me! Tell me!

129
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:48,631
Please lower your voice!

130
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:50,105
Please! Please!

131
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:52,777
How many times have we explained it to you now?

132
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:55,607
If you don't stop this, we'll have to restrain you!

133
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,838
Oh, for goodness's sake!

134
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:02,850
Zenitsu.

135
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:06,530
What happened? Are you all right?

136
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:09,218
So you came up the mountain after all.

137
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:12,859
T-Tanjiro.

138
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,970
It was terrible, Tanjiro. Just awful!

139
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:22,430
I got bit by this icky spider, and it really hurt!

140
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:28,136
That girl's been yelling at me ever since I
arrived at this place also! I hate my life!

141
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:31,461
Hey, stop crying on me. I've got nothing to do with this.

142
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,711
Zenitsu, did you...

143
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,110
Get smaller or something?

144
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:44,344
I almost got turned into a spider, so my
arms and legs are really short right now.

145
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,844
So that's what happened.

146
00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:49,705
And the others? Where are Inosuke and Murata?

147
00:13:50,093 --> 00:13:54,810
I don't know about anyone named
Murata, but Inosuke's right over there.

148
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:56,989
Oh, you're right!

149
00:13:58,345 --> 00:14:01,384
He's been here all this time, and I didn't notice!

150
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:07,409
Inosuke! I'm glad you're safe.

151
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,120
I'm so relieved.

152
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:15,137
Sorry I couldn't rescue you.

153
00:14:17,971 --> 00:14:21,506
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

154
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:23,295
Help! I need a handkerchief or something!

155
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,581
Your voice. Is that really you?

156
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,006
Is anybody listening to me?!

157
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:31,013
I heard he mangled his throat or something.

158
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:36,440
I don't know all the details,
but I heard he got hit in the neck,

159
00:14:36,804 --> 00:14:41,846
and when he yelled at the top of his lungs
sometime after, that's what pushed him over the edge.

160
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:43,783
It really messed him up, as you can hear.

161
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:49,204
The whole thing has taken the wind out of his sails
and made him really passive. You know, it's kind of funny.

162
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:57,046
Why are you cackling all weird
like that suddenly? What's going on?

163
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,967
I'm sorry... For being so weak.

164
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,220
Eww.

165
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:12,293
Don't be sad, Inosuke. This isn't like you at all.

166
00:15:12,723 --> 00:15:15,977
Yeah, there's nothing to worry about! You did great!

167
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:18,067
I'm just so happy that you're all right!

168
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:22,306
Wait! Did I take my morning medicine?!

169
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:26,749
Did you see me take it?! Did
anybody see me take it?! Anyone?!

170
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:41,985
Zenitsu, Inosuke...

171
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:46,403
You're alive. I'm so glad.

172
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:12,932
It's all right now. They said it was
fine for you to use this room, Nezuko.

173
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:18,554
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

174
00:16:21,725 --> 00:16:24,767
That whole encounter up on the mountain was really brutal.

175
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:30,627
I gotta be honest. Everything hurts right now.

176
00:16:32,215 --> 00:16:32,891
Nezuko...

177
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:37,576
What you did, protecting me on the mountain, thank you.

178
00:16:40,075 --> 00:16:44,881
There are the others, too, Tomioka, Urokodaki.

179
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:50,005
They've all gone out and risked their lives on our behalf.

180
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:52,911
It's really something, huh?

181
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:58,660
I-I have to become stronger.

182
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,086
Take today.

183
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:08,604
If it weren't for the Hashira's
master, we may not have been spared.

184
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:15,639
That man's voice... It was mysteriously soothing.

185
00:17:17,094 --> 00:17:20,289
Just listening to him speak made my body feel light.

186
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:23,952
Who is he, exactly?

187
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:41,610
That makes sense. You've had a long day.

188
00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:48,553
Even though I'm in a lot of pain right
now, I have to keep pushing forward.

189
00:17:49,304 --> 00:17:57,119
That's because I'll be a grown man one
day, and then I'll become old and pass on.

190
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:02,823
After that, if you're still a
demon, then you'll be lonely.

191
00:18:05,363 --> 00:18:08,714
That would be far too lonely, wouldn't it?

192
00:18:11,635 --> 00:18:16,505
I promise... I will turn you back into a human.

193
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:29,056
Just as you all have reported, the carnage
of the demons has grown more than ever,

194
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:33,921
meaning the threat to human life in
turn is greater than it has ever been.

195
00:18:34,969 --> 00:18:39,494
We must bolster the ranks of the demon
slayers. What, then, are your thoughts?

196
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:47,537
The incident on mount Natagumo says it all. The
caliber of demon slayers has dropped tremendously.

197
00:18:48,205 --> 00:18:53,324
Most of them are useless. The trainers
must have gone blind or something.

198
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,514
You'd think they could at least
tell if someone's competent or not.

199
00:18:58,682 --> 00:19:01,454
Well, that kid today sure packed a lot of power.

200
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:05,801
He landed that dazzling blow on you. He's got potential.

201
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:13,629
The more the human race grows, the
harder it becomes to control and unify them,

202
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:18,590
and in this era, that seems to be even more true.

203
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:23,145
There are those who've joined us
after their loved ones were slaughtered,

204
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:27,443
and there are those of noted pedigree
who have hunted demons for generations,

205
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,648
but for everyone else, it's another matter.

206
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:35,917
Asking laymen for the same or even greater
commitment to our cause, I feel, would be much too cruel.

207
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:41,656
But consider that this boy soon after
joining encountered a Twelve Kizuki.

208
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:43,745
I think he can draw them out!

209
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:48,323
Even we rarely get the chance
to confront one! I am envious!

210
00:19:49,993 --> 00:19:51,343
A fair point.

211
00:19:51,904 --> 00:19:57,049
However, the fact that lower-five
demon made such a drastic move

212
00:19:57,534 --> 00:20:00,909
likely means Kibutsuji is far from mount Natagumo.

213
00:20:02,146 --> 00:20:06,492
Like with Asakusa, whenever he wishes to hide something,

214
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:10,627
he proceeds to create a clever
diversion to throw us off his trail.

215
00:20:11,974 --> 00:20:14,311
To be honest, it's quite frustrating.

216
00:20:16,793 --> 00:20:24,575
But as long as those demons linger as they do now,
freely devouring humans and gaining strength as a result,

217
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:29,834
there is only one thing for us to do
for the sake of those who have died.

218
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:37,744
I feel... You who are present today, the core
Hashira, are the finest unit I have assembled

219
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,591
since the first breathing swordsmen of the feudal era.

220
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:43,394
Tengen Uzui.

221
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:45,559
Kyojuro Rengoku.

222
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,021
Shinobu Kocho.

223
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,392
Mitsuri Kanroji.

224
00:20:51,055 --> 00:20:52,525
Muichiro Tokito.

225
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:55,025
Gyomei Himejima.

226
00:20:55,775 --> 00:20:57,599
Sanemi Shinazugawa.

227
00:20:58,275 --> 00:20:59,801
Iguro Obanai.

228
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,025
Giyu Tomioka.

229
00:21:03,607 --> 00:21:08,536
My beloved children... I look
forward to seeing your success.

230
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:23,554
Muzan Kibutsuji, I swear that I shall defeat you.

231
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:28,297
We will bring you down without fail.
