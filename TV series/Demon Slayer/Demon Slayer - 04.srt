1
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:37,983
There's a reason I won,

2
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:41,467
because I learned how to detect the opening thread.

3
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:46,631
As soon as I pick up the scent,

4
00:02:46,936 --> 00:02:48,674
I'm able to see the thread.

5
00:02:49,285 --> 00:02:50,301
It guides me.

6
00:02:53,703 --> 00:02:56,857
It connects my blade to any opening the enemy leaves me,

7
00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:59,278
and it tightens as soon as I see it.

8
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:09,249
It quickly draws my blade forward.

9
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,773
Then I strike.

10
00:03:32,548 --> 00:03:33,763
Urokodaki.

11
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:42,493
To be honest, I never had any intention
of sending you to the final selection.

12
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:47,650
Because I didn't want to see any more children die.

13
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:52,512
I was sure you wouldn't be able
to cut through this boulder, but...

14
00:03:58,301 --> 00:03:59,891
Well done, Tanjiro.

15
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:02,923
Truly remarkable.

16
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:05,141
I'm very proud.

17
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:16,152
Make sure you come back from final selection alive.

18
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:19,152
Your sister and I will be waiting for you.

19
00:04:32,578 --> 00:04:34,673
There's so much food. What's the deal?

20
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:38,030
You finished your training, so we're celebrating.

21
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:40,761
Time to eat. Don't be shy.

22
00:04:42,197 --> 00:04:43,552
Thank you. I'm starving.

23
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:49,796
Tanjiro

24
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:53,111
I'm afraid there's nothing more I can do for you.

25
00:04:53,883 --> 00:04:58,470
After today, you will be facing unimaginable hardships.

26
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:01,135
Your training pales in comparison.

27
00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:03,512
But, at least for tonight,

28
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:07,488
you can rest well and sleep soundly one last time.

29
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:25,994
Hey, Tanjiro.

30
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,481
Eh? Yes?

31
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:31,946
What did you think of the hot pot?

32
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:35,520
Great! I haven't feasted like that in a while.

33
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:42,281
A growing boy with an appetite like yours will
get bigger and stronger, the bigger his meals are.

34
00:05:42,977 --> 00:05:45,475
The same applies to demons.

35
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:47,988
Remember that.

36
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:52,413
The more humans a demon has
eaten, the more powerful he'll be.

37
00:05:53,138 --> 00:05:56,038
So, if they eat a lot, they'll be tough to defeat?

38
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:58,133
That's right.

39
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:01,643
They get stronger, physical traits change,

40
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:04,151
and some learn to use strange spells.

41
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:13,706
You'll be able to tell how many poor souls they've claimed

42
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:16,606
once your sense of smell is even more developed.

43
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:20,767
What's this?

44
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:24,244
It is called a warding mask.

45
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:27,044
It's been enchanted by a protection spell

46
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,885
to keep you from harm.

47
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,490
Now it makes sense.

48
00:07:01,626 --> 00:07:02,563
Nezuko.

49
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:13,037
I promise. I'm going to come back for you.

50
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:17,603
No need to worry about your sister.

51
00:07:18,026 --> 00:07:20,099
I'll take good care of her for you.

52
00:07:20,793 --> 00:07:22,900
Thanks for everything.

53
00:07:25,936 --> 00:07:28,404
Guess I'm off. See you later!

54
00:07:34,358 --> 00:07:36,492
Say hi to Sabito and Makomo!

55
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,375
Tanjiro? That's impossible.

56
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,123
How does he know the names of the dead?

57
00:07:57,054 --> 00:07:58,205
Wisteria.

58
00:07:58,529 --> 00:07:59,951
It's all over the place.

59
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:03,084
I thought it was out of season.

60
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,050
So many people.

61
00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:39,980
Good evening.

62
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:45,001
Tonight you've come to enter the
demon slayer corps's final selection.

63
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:47,066
Thank you all for being here.

64
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:49,816
Here on mount Fujikasane,

65
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:54,071
there are several demons that were
captured alive by demon slayer swordsmen.

66
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:56,511
They are kept here for this event.

67
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,261
The Wisteria blossoms prevent them from leaving.

68
00:09:00,368 --> 00:09:02,846
They bloom on this mountain year-round,

69
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:06,140
and they cover everything from
the base to halfway to the top.

70
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:09,283
But the Wisteria ends here,

71
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,814
so demons abound from this point on,

72
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,441
and they're very hungry.

73
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,780
In order to complete final selection,

74
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:21,413
you must survive for seven days
beyond the Wisteria's protection.

75
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:25,509
Now your trial begins.

76
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:41,752
Survive.

77
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:43,567
Don't think about anything else.

78
00:09:47,685 --> 00:09:49,536
I just have to make it through the night.

79
00:09:50,346 --> 00:09:53,240
Once the sun comes up, the
demons won't be able to do anything.

80
00:09:53,535 --> 00:09:55,240
That'll be my chance to rest.

81
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:57,780
Which means I need to head east,

82
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:01,249
make my way to where the sunlight will hit first.

83
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:09,422
I smell a demon close by.

84
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,437
Where is it? Where's it coming from?

85
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:22,935
I can't seem to pin it down.

86
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,024
Up there!

87
00:10:35,582 --> 00:10:36,441
Found you.

88
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:43,759
Damn you!

89
00:10:45,662 --> 00:10:48,196
Why don't you go find your own snack?

90
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:49,596
This is my turf!

91
00:10:49,695 --> 00:10:52,100
Your turf? Ah, go to hell!

92
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:53,719
Two already.

93
00:10:53,966 --> 00:10:55,067
Can I handle them?

94
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:55,600
Says who?

95
00:10:55,832 --> 00:10:57,459
I saw him first!

96
00:10:57,528 --> 00:11:00,504
Doesn't matter! I'll be the first to kill him!

97
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:10,235
You've got this. Calm down, and watch closely.

98
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:12,154
Don't forget your training.

99
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,950
Haven't tasted human flesh in forever!

100
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:16,557
Total concentration.

101
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:17,771
Water breathing!

102
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,219
I smell the thread.

103
00:11:28,248 --> 00:11:29,241
Fourth form!

104
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:31,598
Striking tide!

105
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:42,515
I did it.

106
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:46,640
I killed demons.

107
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:48,765
I'm getting stronger!

108
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:51,953
So my training wasn't for nothing.

109
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:54,190
I did master it.

110
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:05,125
Nothing's left behind when a
demon's killed with this sword,

111
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:06,940
not even the bones.

112
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,392
A demon's weakest at the neck.

113
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:17,235
However, a normal sword is useless, even upon the neck.

114
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:20,736
Okay. So how do I kill them?

115
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:25,857
With a demon slayer's katana
forged by a special type of steel.

116
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:28,792
That's the only weapon that can kill a demon.

117
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:33,626
It's called a nichirin sword.

118
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:42,311
Rest in peace.

119
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:48,026
What the...

120
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:50,058
What's that awful smell?

121
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,878
What the hell?!

122
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:54,913
I didn't sign up for this!

123
00:12:55,857 --> 00:12:56,425
What?

124
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:11,811
My god. What is that?

125
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:24,623
Hey, Sabito.

126
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:28,600
You think Tanjiro can beat him?

127
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:31,797
I don't know.

128
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:35,972
It seems nothing's ever going to be enough.

129
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,971
You saw for yourself, didn't you?

130
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:48,337
What's this mutated demon doing here?

131
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:50,066
Nobody said anything!

132
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,158
Swallowed whole!

133
00:14:22,886 --> 00:14:23,919
No!

134
00:14:35,897 --> 00:14:36,829
Stay strong!

135
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,738
Save him. Save him. Save him.

136
00:14:39,856 --> 00:14:41,922
You're not powerless anymore!

137
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:43,350
Move it!

138
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:47,068
Water breathing, second form!

139
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:48,505
Water wheel!

140
00:14:57,933 --> 00:14:59,473
Well, look at that.

141
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,457
It's another one of those sweet little foxes.

142
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:03,665
"Another"?

143
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:07,187
Say, fox cub, the year?

144
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:08,924
Are we still in Meiji?

145
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,994
It's the Taisho period!

146
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:15,019
Taisho?

147
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:21,364
Already?!

148
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:24,747
We have passed into a new period?!

149
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,119
Again!

150
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:29,869
And I'm still stuck inside this Wisteria prison!

151
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,369
Unforgivable! Unforgivable!

152
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,007
Damn you, Urokodaki!

153
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:39,454
Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!

154
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:41,128
You know Urokodaki?

155
00:15:41,498 --> 00:15:42,773
Of course I do.

156
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:46,214
Urokodaki's the one who captured me and brought me here!

157
00:15:46,582 --> 00:15:49,218
But that was 47 years ago now,

158
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:52,449
back when he was still hunting demons like me,

159
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,390
the Edo period, during the Keio era.

160
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:57,778
No way. Edo period?

161
00:15:58,074 --> 00:15:59,151
You lie!

162
00:15:59,316 --> 00:16:01,899
No demon could ever live that long in here!

163
00:16:02,123 --> 00:16:05,979
Besides, all these demons have
only eaten two or three humans!

164
00:16:06,488 --> 00:16:08,258
They die during final selection.

165
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:11,192
In fact, they even eat their own kind!

166
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:15,166
And yet I've managed to survive here all this time,

167
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,916
trapped in this flowery cage.

168
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:21,916
I've managed to devour at least 50 of you brats.

169
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:23,421
50 people?!

170
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:25,844
11

171
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:27,300
12

172
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:29,845
13.

173
00:16:30,443 --> 00:16:32,837
That means you're number 14.

174
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,695
What are you talking about?

175
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:39,488
That's how many of Urokodaki's students I've eaten.

176
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,862
I promised myself I'd kill every single one of them.

177
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,575
You know, the ones who stood
out to me the most were those two.

178
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:53,075
Ah, yes.

179
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,416
The boy's hair was an unusual shade of pink,

180
00:16:56,645 --> 00:16:58,371
a scar by his mouth.

181
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:01,025
He was the most powerful of the lot.

182
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:05,644
The other one was a girl who wore a flowery kimono,

183
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:09,841
small, not much power, but awfully agile.

184
00:17:11,551 --> 00:17:12,847
So they were dead?

185
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,597
Killed by this demon?

186
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:16,408
But I was with them.

187
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,847
Your mask, that's what gives you
away as one of Urokodaki's brats.

188
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:26,357
Easy to spot the texture of one of the masks he's carved.

189
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,837
They always match the style of the tengu mask he wears.

190
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,569
He calls them "warding masks," right?

191
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:36,750
Except that's how I pick out who to eat.

192
00:17:36,854 --> 00:17:38,732
They're all inside my belly.

193
00:17:38,828 --> 00:17:41,599
It's as if he's guided them to their deaths.

194
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:45,554
When I told the girl,

195
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:48,356
she started crying and fell into a rage.

196
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:53,967
But it wasn't long before she
lost all control of her movement.

197
00:17:54,904 --> 00:17:58,902
I ripped her limb from limb and feasted!

198
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:07,282
Calm down, Tanjiro.

199
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:09,697
Your breathing is uneven.

200
00:18:10,581 --> 00:18:13,120
Stay focused. Forget about us.

201
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:26,884
You're on your own, buddy.

202
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:28,134
I'm getting out of here.

203
00:18:39,861 --> 00:18:42,687
There goes another one of Urokodaki's brats.

204
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:49,574
I wonder, how will he feel when another
one of his children doesn't make it back home?

205
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:52,735
Oh, I wish I could see the look on his face.

206
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:56,790
I bet it's going to be priceless.

207
00:18:57,017 --> 00:18:59,163
If only I could be there.

208
00:19:03,986 --> 00:19:05,306
Tanjiro!

209
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:07,535
Tanjiro!

210
00:19:10,386 --> 00:19:12,995
What's this? He can still move.

211
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:16,392
That means I can have some fun!

212
00:19:23,571 --> 00:19:25,745
Damn! I can't just cut his arms off.

213
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,193
They regrow too fast!

214
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:31,853
That's not going to be enough
for you to beat me, little fox.

215
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:37,356
But, then again, not even that
pink-haired brat could cut off my head!

216
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:50,568
There's no way I can just let him go.

217
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:54,174
I won't let another life be sacrificed.

218
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:57,050
No more! I'll take him down!

219
00:20:01,746 --> 00:20:03,679
Wait a second. Underground!

220
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:09,944
H-he jumped!

221
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:11,687
Damn it, how did he know?

222
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:16,319
No matter. He won't be able to dodge an attack in midair!

223
00:20:18,465 --> 00:20:20,995
Do you think he's going to beat Tanjiro, too?

224
00:20:21,938 --> 00:20:24,539
His neck is thick. Can it be cut?

225
00:20:26,388 --> 00:20:28,750
I can't say whether he'll win or lose today.

226
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:33,750
However, one fact is irrefutable either way.

227
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:39,995
Tanjiro cut through this boulder,

228
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:43,691
the toughest and largest boulder of them all.

229
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:49,228
He deflected it!

230
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,887
Total concentration. Water breathing!

231
00:21:00,503 --> 00:21:02,206
I let him get too close.

232
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:07,249
Not to worry. My neck is tough. He can't cut through it.

233
00:21:07,512 --> 00:21:08,663
First form!

234
00:21:08,982 --> 00:21:13,211
As soon as he fails, I'm going
to grab his head and crush it,

235
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:15,575
just like I did to the other one!

236
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,000
Water surface slash!
