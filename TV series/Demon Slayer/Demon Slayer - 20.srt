1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,520
Blood Demon art.

2
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:04,206
Exploding blood!

3
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:14,897
The bond between Nezuko and I

4
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:19,231
cannot be severed, not by anyone!

5
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:17,214
Nezuko.

6
00:02:18,243 --> 00:02:19,816
Nezuko!

7
00:02:22,427 --> 00:02:24,834
I won. I did it!

8
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,989
My father saved me.

9
00:02:28,677 --> 00:02:30,150
Our family's Kagura,

10
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:32,858
which has been passed down for generations,

11
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:36,481
somehow manifested itself into a technique

12
00:02:36,742 --> 00:02:39,030
and helped me defeat that Demon.

13
00:02:44,502 --> 00:02:45,301
Huh?

14
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:47,549
My vision's blurry.

15
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:51,166
Is it because I took too many breaths too fast?

16
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:57,290
This ringing in my ears is agonizing.

17
00:02:57,494 --> 00:02:59,879
My whole body is throbbing with pain.

18
00:03:01,735 --> 00:03:03,842
I need to catch my second wind...

19
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:05,234
And press on.

20
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:10,440
The fight's not over, not yet.

21
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:15,658
I still need to go save Inosuke as soon as I can.

22
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,197
The scent of blood just got stronger,

23
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,593
and it didn't give off the smell of ash like usual.

24
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,045
Don't tell me.

25
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:35,692
could he have survived that?

26
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:38,967
You thought you'd defeated me?

27
00:03:39,156 --> 00:03:40,740
How sad for you.

28
00:03:41,032 --> 00:03:44,317
Did your delusion bring you a brief moment of joy?

29
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:48,307
I cut my head off myself using my own threads...

30
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:51,750
Before you were able to do the job yourself.

31
00:03:53,212 --> 00:03:54,720
Enough struggling.

32
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:57,484
I'll kill both you and your sister.

33
00:03:57,928 --> 00:04:00,927
I haven't been this incensed in a long time.

34
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:03,358
Get up!

35
00:04:03,781 --> 00:04:04,931
Get on your feet.

36
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:07,346
You need to control your breathing.

37
00:04:07,652 --> 00:04:09,367
Hurry! There's no time!

38
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,024
I wonder why you weren't burned to
cinders earlier in that explosion.

39
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:17,636
Me and my threads were the
only things that were set ablaze.

40
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,504
I don't know if it relates to your sister's power,

41
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,327
but it has enraged me all the same.

42
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:28,139
Now I'm going to carve you up without regret.

43
00:04:29,608 --> 00:04:33,817
If I use the correct breathing technique,
it doesn't matter how exhausted I am.

44
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,408
Blood Demon art.

45
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:38,043
Murderous eye basket.

46
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:43,655
Don't let your breathing be disrupted, Tanjiro.

47
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:46,523
Calm down. Just stay calm.

48
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,885
I can't raise my arm.

49
00:05:03,857 --> 00:05:05,284
somebody's here.

50
00:05:06,077 --> 00:05:07,403
Is it Zenitsu?

51
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:12,593
You did a good job holding out until I got here.

52
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,721
Leave the rest to me.

53
00:05:19,204 --> 00:05:24,643
You're like an endless torrent of insignificant
insects, constantly getting in my way.

54
00:05:24,844 --> 00:05:26,418
Blood Demon art.

55
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,911
cutting thread rotation!

56
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:37,299
Total concentration.

57
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:40,936
Water breathing. 11th form...

58
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:44,023
Dead calm.

59
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:46,838
The 11th form?

60
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:50,117
It doesn't matter what technique you use on me!

61
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:53,217
What?

62
00:05:56,204 --> 00:05:58,990
What's going on? What did he do?

63
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:03,333
The instant they touched him, the threads scattered.

64
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:06,337
Not even one of them reached him.

65
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,119
The strongest threads of all were destroyed?

66
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:12,675
That cannot be!

67
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:14,590
I'll try it again!

68
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:27,406
I messed up. I really messed up.

69
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,881
This whole time we were pretending to be a family,

70
00:06:30,906 --> 00:06:33,417
I was the only one who had a perfect track record,

71
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,743
until now!

72
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,756
We've finally cornered her.

73
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:50,344
Hey, look.

74
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:51,437
Huh?

75
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,559
A Demon?

76
00:07:00,604 --> 00:07:01,940
It's just a runt,

77
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,768
but even if it looks like a kid, it's still a threat.

78
00:07:06,322 --> 00:07:08,770
If we let it go, it'll devour humans.

79
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:10,342
You there...

80
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:14,417
Tell me, do you want me to save you?

81
00:07:14,665 --> 00:07:15,264
What?

82
00:07:16,123 --> 00:07:17,558
I will do so

83
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:19,705
if you'll do whatever I ask.

84
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,557
Yes, I accept!

85
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,296
I'll do whatever you want! Just save me!

86
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,772
So then, you'll become part of my family?

87
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:29,962
Yes! Just help me!

88
00:07:29,987 --> 00:07:31,412
What are they talking about?

89
00:07:32,443 --> 00:07:34,245
All right, it's over for you!

90
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:12,609
Welcome home.

91
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:16,721
Starting today, you will also be part of my family.

92
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:43,530
Drink this.

93
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:45,890
The strength that exists in our family

94
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,610
is all thanks to Rui.

95
00:08:48,907 --> 00:08:50,737
And since all of us were quite weak,

96
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:53,081
Rui shared his power with us.

97
00:08:54,114 --> 00:08:56,329
He is a favorite of a certain someone,

98
00:08:56,868 --> 00:09:00,027
and because of that, he has permission to do this.

99
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:12,944
Do you feel it?

100
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,901
There's no need to fear those Demon slayers any longer.

101
00:09:18,273 --> 00:09:19,147
Now, then...

102
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,997
Time for the finishing touches.

103
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,526
Good. You can look now.

104
00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:50,063
Congratulations. You're truly part of the family.

105
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:24,036
We're only playing house.

106
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:25,432
What?

107
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:27,420
There's no blood relation.

108
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,636
We're just a band of strangers.

109
00:10:30,236 --> 00:10:31,764
I'm so sorry!

110
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:33,780
I'll do better, Rui!

111
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,927
I'll work harder to keep it from happening! I promise!

112
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:39,867
I didn't mean to revert to this form.

113
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:43,417
It just happens by accident sometimes.

114
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:55,053
I don't want your excuses, mother.

115
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,890
You will play your assigned role.

116
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,507
I understand, Rui.

117
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:10,131
We were so scared of the Demon
slayers and sought companionship.

118
00:11:12,544 --> 00:11:13,680
But this charade,

119
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:17,818
I don't think that was what any of
us had in mind when we agreed to this.

120
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:19,540
But at the end of the day,

121
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:21,655
those who disappoint him are punished.

122
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:25,315
They get carved up, have their intellect taken,

123
00:11:25,762 --> 00:11:28,097
or are forced to burn in the sunlight.

124
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,914
I can't take it any longer.

125
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:34,567
I'll pretend I never heard that. Instead...

126
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:36,903
I can tell that you're not like the others.

127
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:39,932
You're much more enlightened.

128
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:43,397
Let's run away together.

129
00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:48,188
I wouldn't say this to anyone but you.

130
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:53,025
You're the one person I truly
think of as my younger sister.

131
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:04,302
Tomorrow, Rui will be summoned by that man

132
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:05,830
and descend the mountain.

133
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:08,420
That will be our chance to escape.

134
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,658
How disappointing.

135
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:13,352
They were all fools, but I'm not like them!

136
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,885
And yet, I still messed up!

137
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:21,441
Rui. Rui!

138
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:23,287
Mother's been killed

139
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:25,764
and our elder brother, too!

140
00:13:26,604 --> 00:13:30,430
What now? The Demon slayers aren't far behind us.

141
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:32,782
Rui...

142
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:37,172
Sh-shouldn't we make a run for it?

143
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:40,644
No.

144
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:45,227
I've told you before.

145
00:13:46,352 --> 00:13:50,075
I really hate it when your face changes back like that.

146
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:55,676
What are you looking at?

147
00:13:56,117 --> 00:13:58,392
This isn't a play, you know.

148
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:02,749
I only got my face slashed.

149
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:04,636
I got off easy.

150
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,645
A Demon!

151
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:11,779
What the...

152
00:14:14,174 --> 00:14:16,673
It's no use. That won't work.

153
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:21,343
My ball of yarn may feel soft,
but it's also quite durable.

154
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:27,579
First, the solvent will melt your clothes down to nothing,

155
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:30,287
and then it'll be your turn.

156
00:14:30,474 --> 00:14:34,224
After you're reduced to a pulp,
I will feed on your remains.

157
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:36,745
Wow! That's incredible!

158
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:39,760
Do you release those threads from the palms of your hands?

159
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:42,399
Good evening.

160
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,041
The moon's quite lovely tonight, isn't it?

161
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:03,844
I can see you have no intention
of being my friend, now, do you?

162
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,692
No. Wait!

163
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,900
Let me explain!

164
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,522
Someone's... someone's forcing me to do all this!

165
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:14,671
If I don't, I'll be torn to pieces.

166
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:17,635
My, is that really true?

167
00:15:17,748 --> 00:15:19,361
That does sound tragic.

168
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:21,003
I'll save you!

169
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,760
So let's be friends!

170
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:25,320
You... you're going to save me?

171
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:26,867
Of course!

172
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,321
But in order for us to be friends,

173
00:15:29,474 --> 00:15:32,036
I must ask you a few questions first.

174
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,186
Tell me, my sweet child,

175
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:38,334
how many have you been responsible for killing?

176
00:15:39,514 --> 00:15:40,689
Five humans.

177
00:15:44,662 --> 00:15:46,192
But I was ordered to.

178
00:15:46,365 --> 00:15:48,111
I didn't have a choice.

179
00:15:48,451 --> 00:15:51,158
Now, now. There's no need to lie about it.

180
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,805
I know the truth.

181
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:58,126
That spell you cast to turn one of our
men into a cocoon was most impressive.

182
00:15:58,912 --> 00:16:01,207
You've eaten at least 80 humans.

183
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,749
I don't know what you're saying.

184
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:05,804
I've only killed those five.

185
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:09,386
I happened to come to this place from the west, you know.

186
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:12,308
I saw things differently.

187
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:16,016
It was there that I witnessed hordes of cocoons...

188
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:17,911
Hanging from the trees.

189
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:23,923
The human captives inside had
been liquefied, all massacred.

190
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:28,357
In that spot alone, I counted at least 14 cocoons,

191
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:31,998
14 humans, all dead and gone.

192
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:35,069
Oh, don't mistake me for being angry.

193
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:37,114
I'm just checking if the death toll

194
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,534
is an accurate one.

195
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,595
What good does it do for you to confirm that?

196
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:46,622
So I can see you receive the proper penalty and be reborn.

197
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:47,662
Penalty?

198
00:16:48,015 --> 00:16:50,803
Yes! That way, you and I can become friends.

199
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:57,100
If you go unpunished after having taken all
those lives, your victims will never receive justice.

200
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:00,531
I could gouge out your eyeballs

201
00:17:00,678 --> 00:17:04,215
or perhaps slash your stomach and rip out your organs.

202
00:17:04,782 --> 00:17:06,656
For every life you've taken,

203
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:09,503
I'll exact the same amount of pain on you,

204
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:15,421
and after you've suffered through all of
the agony required, your sins will be forgiven.

205
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:17,968
Let's both give it our all.

206
00:17:18,962 --> 00:17:20,281
Don't worry, my dear!

207
00:17:20,334 --> 00:17:21,921
You are a Demon after all,

208
00:17:21,994 --> 00:17:25,720
so none of this will kill you
or leave any lingering effects.

209
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,994
Who do you think you're kidding?!

210
00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:30,890
Die, you damn witch!

211
00:17:37,805 --> 00:17:40,693
I can see that we'll never be friends after all.

212
00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:44,070
Aw, what a pity.

213
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:01,945
Eh?

214
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,855
Insect breathing. Butterfly dance...

215
00:18:25,827 --> 00:18:27,222
And caprice.

216
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,518
My head, it hasn't been cut off.

217
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:35,437
That's the sword she's using?

218
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:40,027
I see. She's too tiny and has no arm strength,

219
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:41,669
so she can't behead me.

220
00:18:42,002 --> 00:18:43,798
Her life is mine.

221
00:19:03,482 --> 00:19:05,724
Just because you haven't been beheaded,

222
00:19:05,863 --> 00:19:07,792
don't think that you're safe from harm.

223
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:12,002
There are those like me, who use
poison with their swordsmanship.

224
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:21,228
Demon Slayer Corps, insect Hashira, Shinobu Kocho.

225
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,469
I may be the only one among the Hashira

226
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:27,280
who is unable to decapitate demons,

227
00:19:27,426 --> 00:19:29,803
but creating a poison that's lethal to them,

228
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,231
that's quite impressive, don't you think?

229
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:34,826
Oh! Pardon me!

230
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:37,279
I guess you can't hear me if you're dead.

231
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:39,854
Silly me!

232
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:48,594
Are you all right, sir?

233
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:50,931
Just barely.

234
00:19:51,872 --> 00:19:53,606
What happened to the Demon?

235
00:19:55,434 --> 00:19:57,523
Shouldn't you finish it off or something?

236
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:01,281
I infected her with Wisteria poison.

237
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:02,932
She's already dead.

238
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:04,558
We can leave her to rot.

239
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:08,502
If you were curious, I'm an expert in pharmaceutics.

240
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:12,929
Your clothes were dissolved, but
your body is more or less unscathed!

241
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:14,453
I'm so glad!

242
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:24,455
Now, then, to find the whereabouts of the Demon
she mentioned who was forcing her to do its bidding.

243
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:28,855
Though I wonder if Tomioka has already finished the job.

244
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:32,405
Nezuko, I'm coming.

245
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:37,915
I'll kill them. I'll kill them.

246
00:20:38,381 --> 00:20:40,421
I'll kill that brother and sister,

247
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:43,304
no matter the cost!

248
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:48,407
What it that is you want, Rui?

249
00:20:49,057 --> 00:20:50,922
What do you mean by "family"?

250
00:20:52,264 --> 00:20:53,317
I'm not sure.

251
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,874
I have no memories of when I was human, you see.

252
00:20:58,775 --> 00:21:02,372
Is that why you made us pretend to be your family?

253
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,953
I thought that, if I could feel a family bond,

254
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,980
my memories would come back.

255
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:12,574
the bond of a real family.

256
00:21:19,353 --> 00:21:20,367
That's right.

257
00:21:21,035 --> 00:21:22,079
I remember.

258
00:21:25,706 --> 00:21:26,680
Nezuko.
