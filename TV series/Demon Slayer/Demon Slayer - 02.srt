1
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,365
Pardon me, sir.

2
00:00:07,604 --> 00:00:11,155
Would it be all right if I took that basket
and some straw and bamboo?

3
00:00:11,522 --> 00:00:14,141
You're more than welcome, for all the good it'll do you.

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,016
The basket's full of holes.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,437
Thank you. I'll gladly pay you for it.

6
00:00:18,748 --> 00:00:20,466
No, you don't have to do that.

7
00:00:20,569 --> 00:00:21,744
I don't need it anyway.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,641
Please, I insist.

9
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:27,555
No, it's fine. Same goes for the straw and bamboo.

10
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:29,091
Let me pay you!

11
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:32,760
I said it's fine! So just take it, you stubborn kid!

12
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:36,972
Take this small offering for your trouble, please!

13
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:38,732
And thanks a lot for your help!

14
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:45,369
Nezuko?

15
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:47,740
Hey, Nezuko?

16
00:00:48,377 --> 00:00:49,433
She's gone!

17
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,599
Hey, Nezuko...

18
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:38,822
Why'd she dig a hole?

19
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:42,318
Is my demon kid sister turning into a mole now?

20
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:48,646
And she doesn't look very happy about it, either.

21
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,587
Guess she really wants to avoid the sun.

22
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,246
Hang on just a second.

23
00:02:58,515 --> 00:03:00,343
Nezuko? Nezuko?

24
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:02,842
You think you could fit in here?

25
00:03:03,273 --> 00:03:05,637
I want to try to keep moving during the day, too,

26
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:08,203
but I can carry you, okay?

27
00:03:10,268 --> 00:03:12,304
Can you fit? In here?

28
00:03:12,696 --> 00:03:13,630
Bas-ket.

29
00:03:20,047 --> 00:03:22,215
Uh, guess not.

30
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,530
I can't believe how grown-up she is.

31
00:03:26,842 --> 00:03:29,843
Seems like yesterday she was half that size.

32
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,623
Hey, uh, Nezuko,
remember how you got really big the other day?

33
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:39,951
I've got an idea. Do you think you could get smaller?

34
00:03:40,522 --> 00:03:42,058
Come on, Nezuko.

35
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:44,161
Get smaller for me.

36
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:54,499
Nice job!

37
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:56,603
Who's a good girl?

38
00:03:56,628 --> 00:03:58,179
You are, Nezuko.

39
00:03:58,451 --> 00:03:59,494
I'm impressed.

40
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:05,150
Mount Sagiri?

41
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:09,437
If you really want to go there,
the fastest way is over that mountain.

42
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:14,353
But the sun's about to set,
and you're hauling an awful lot of luggage.

43
00:04:14,597 --> 00:04:16,107
It's dangerous.

44
00:04:16,747 --> 00:04:18,506
Please don't worry. I'll be careful.

45
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:20,661
And thank you for the directions.

46
00:04:23,726 --> 00:04:27,512
A lot of people have been going missing
on that mountain lately!

47
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,418
Don't get lost, okay?

48
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:39,770
It's a temple.

49
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,325
Looks like the light's been left on,
so somebody must be there.

50
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:45,771
Let's check it out.

51
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:51,464
That's the scent of blood.

52
00:04:52,344 --> 00:04:53,878
This path can be pretty rough.

53
00:04:53,963 --> 00:04:55,429
Somebody must be hurt!

54
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:04,436
Is everyone okay?

55
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:14,194
The hell are you doing here?

56
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,974
This is my territory.

57
00:05:17,854 --> 00:05:22,111
Anybody who sets foot on my turf is gonna have to pay.

58
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,894
It's a demon!

59
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,824
Something's not quite right about you.

60
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,342
Hang on. Are you two human?

61
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,625
A hatchet? Not bad, kid.

62
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:04,842
Just a little scratch, though.

63
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:07,208
Should heal in no time.

64
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:13,168
See that? The bleeding's already stopped.

65
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,926
He's so fast and insanely strong.

66
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:36,754
You got lucky, but it won't work again.

67
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:40,224
And now I'm gonna snap your neck!

68
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:03,862
She...

69
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:05,948
Nezuko, you killed him!

70
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:08,749
Wait a minute! But he's a demon!

71
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:10,909
N-Nezuko.

72
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:17,499
I don't believe it.

73
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:20,999
Did that body just move and without a head?

74
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:22,583
You bastards!

75
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:26,438
So the girl's a demon after all, huh?

76
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:28,990
I couldn't tell with that weird vibe you gave off.

77
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:31,989
But what are you doing teaming up with a human?!

78
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:34,098
How's he still talking?!

79
00:07:42,805 --> 00:07:43,863
Leave her alone!

80
00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:53,618
Nezuko!

81
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:02,524
No, Nezuko!

82
00:08:08,543 --> 00:08:10,262
What the hell is with this guy?

83
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:13,009
Who grows arms out of the side of their head?!

84
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:15,097
I've gotta help Nezuko!

85
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,560
Out of the way!

86
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:25,310
So hard.

87
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:27,784
This kid's head is...

88
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,306
Damn hard!

89
00:08:38,938 --> 00:08:39,761
Yes!

90
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,940
Wrapping my hair around his hatchet
wasn't a great idea. Damn.

91
00:08:48,797 --> 00:08:51,442
Nezuko! Where are you?!

92
00:09:04,058 --> 00:09:05,168
Nezuko!

93
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:06,932
Get away from her!

94
00:09:41,946 --> 00:09:45,556
I wonder, how many demons are there?

95
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,449
This isn't the scent I found at my house.

96
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:51,925
It's different, but

97
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:54,694
I still have to finish him off,

98
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,702
or he'll keep killing people.

99
00:09:57,491 --> 00:10:00,751
So that means I have to do it.

100
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:08,136
Just do it.

101
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:20,812
That knife isn't going to do the job.

102
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:24,151
What's with the mask?

103
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,399
And I couldn't hear his footsteps.

104
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,649
O-Okay.

105
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,649
How do I kill him, then?

106
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:33,899
Think for yourself.

107
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:37,079
Or aren't you capable of solving your own problems?

108
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,143
Stabbing the head won't work,

109
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:45,373
so I'll have to crush it.

110
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,705
I probably have to crush his skull completely,

111
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:58,679
which means hitting him with this rock over and over.

112
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,252
I bet he'll suffer.

113
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:05,502
Isn't there any way for me
to finish him off with one blow?

114
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,452
This kid's not going to cut it.

115
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:17,968
He's far too kind and far too indecisive.

116
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:20,779
He stands against a demon,

117
00:11:20,826 --> 00:11:23,033
yet the scent of kindness remains.

118
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:27,206
He still has empathy, even for a demon.

119
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:32,472
Giyu, this boy will never make it.

120
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:40,508
I blacked out for a second there.

121
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:43,627
Does that mean that my body's dead?

122
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:45,538
I think I'm gonna be sick.

123
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:50,448
You bastard, I'll kill you!

124
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:51,677
Get over here!

125
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:53,649
I'll devour you, damn it!

126
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:56,400
Now get over here where I can reach you, you little brat!

127
00:11:56,937 --> 00:11:57,595
Hey, aren't you...

128
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,942
I took too long.

129
00:11:59,097 --> 00:12:00,755
The sun's already coming up.

130
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:03,068
I am gonna enjoy eating you more than...

131
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:18,075
It only takes that much sunlight to melt him?

132
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:20,257
No wonder Nezuko was hiding.

133
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:23,649
Nezuko?

134
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:25,434
Nezuko!

135
00:12:40,652 --> 00:12:41,684
You're all right.

136
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,325
Hang on. Where's the old guy?

137
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,515
He's holding a burial for the people who got killed.

138
00:13:06,423 --> 00:13:07,400
Excuse me.

139
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:12,477
My name is Sakonji Urokodaki.

140
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:16,506
You're the one Giyu Tomioka sent my way, correct?

141
00:13:16,722 --> 00:13:19,742
I am! I'm Tanjiro Kamado,

142
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:22,353
and my sister's name is Nezuko.

143
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:23,739
Tanjiro...

144
00:13:24,422 --> 00:13:27,912
What do you intend to do if your sister eats a human?

145
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:40,215
You're too indecisive.

146
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:43,912
You must learn to make decisions quickly.

147
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:47,414
That's why you failed to kill that demon before daybreak.

148
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:52,903
Do you know why it took you so long
to answer my simple question?

149
00:13:53,236 --> 00:13:55,769
Because your resolve is too weak.

150
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:59,771
There are two things you must do
if your sister eats a human.

151
00:14:00,314 --> 00:14:01,771
First, you kill her.

152
00:14:02,062 --> 00:14:04,202
Then slit your own belly and die.

153
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:08,854
That's what traveling alongside a demon
like your sister means.

154
00:14:09,654 --> 00:14:12,401
But you must never allow this to happen,

155
00:14:12,513 --> 00:14:14,404
no matter the cost.

156
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:18,348
Your sister taking the life of an innocent person

157
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,154
is the one thing that can't happen, ever!

158
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:24,853
Have I made myself perfectly clear?

159
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:25,694
Yes!

160
00:14:27,018 --> 00:14:28,008
Very well.

161
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:33,442
I will test whether or not you are fit
to become a member of the demon slayer corps.

162
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:36,921
Carry your sister, and follow me!

163
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:50,114
So fast. But I thought he was an old man!

164
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:54,364
And, still, I can't hear his footsteps at all!

165
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:58,930
Nezuko, the ride may be bumpy, but just hang on.

166
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:03,351
But then, you always did know how to be patient.

167
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:06,159
Didn't you, Nezuko?

168
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:09,626
Fixing your kimono again?

169
00:15:10,498 --> 00:15:12,682
That settles it. We'll have to buy you a new one.

170
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,477
No, no, it's fine, really!

171
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,854
This kimono is my favorite.

172
00:15:18,402 --> 00:15:20,134
Besides, it's not important.

173
00:15:20,514 --> 00:15:22,737
I'd rather feed our brothers and sisters.

174
00:15:25,102 --> 00:15:28,129
I swear, I'll turn you back into a human,

175
00:15:28,313 --> 00:15:31,387
and then I'm gonna buy you a beautiful kimono!

176
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:34,893
Everything I wasn't able to do for the others,

177
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:37,251
I'll do it all for you!

178
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:47,751
Okay. Does this... Does this mean...

179
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:50,763
Please tell me this means that I passed the test.

180
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:59,524
We're just beginning the test.

181
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:01,453
We'll be climbing a mountain.

182
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,293
I promise I'll take care of your sister for you
while you're gone.

183
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,129
I do appreciate that, sir.

184
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:27,736
Oh, man.

185
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,275
I'm so exhausted, my legs are starting to buckle,

186
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:33,722
and I'm getting dizzy, too.

187
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,477
Now find your way back to my house
at the foot of the mountain.

188
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,988
This time, I won't wait until daybreak.

189
00:16:50,232 --> 00:16:51,554
That's the test?

190
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,205
I get it.

191
00:16:55,901 --> 00:16:58,576
Because of the fog, he thinks I might get lost.

192
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,560
All I have to do is get back by daybreak?

193
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:06,053
No problem, not with my sense of smell.

194
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:08,710
I've memorized Mr. Urokodaki's scent.

195
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,165
What the?!

196
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:34,687
A tiger pit?

197
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,240
Of course.

198
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:40,402
There are traps all over the mountain.

199
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,648
That's why this is a test.

200
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:45,553
Oh, no!

201
00:17:51,883 --> 00:17:53,258
Crap, crap, crap.

202
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:57,589
If I keep walking into these traps,
I'll never make it down the mountain by morning.

203
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:01,082
Not to mention, besides the traps,

204
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:02,452
the air here is...

205
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,820
The air is thin on this mountain,

206
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:08,851
a whole lot thinner than on the mountain where I grew up.

207
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,090
It's no wonder I feel so dizzy.

208
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:13,523
I can't breathe.

209
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:16,328
I hope I can make it.

210
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:18,039
I might pass out.

211
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:21,491
No, I have to make it!

212
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,037
Control your breathing.

213
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:26,370
Then sniff out all of those traps.

214
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:54,538
Yes, got it! Piece of cake!

215
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:56,917
These traps were set by a human,

216
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,288
which means their scent sticks out to me!

217
00:19:05,946 --> 00:19:07,203
But I guess...

218
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:11,141
That doesn't solve all my problems,

219
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,872
because I'm still not athletic enough
to dodge every single one of them!

220
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,615
I'll make it back, no matter what...

221
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:20,566
For Nezuko!

222
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:51,678
I made it...

223
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:54,231
Back down.

224
00:19:57,069 --> 00:20:00,224
Dear Urokodaki, sir, forgive the intrusion.

225
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,120
There's a boy headed your way in need of instruction.

226
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:06,220
He wants to be a demon slayer.

227
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:10,720
He was fearless enough to try to attack me unarmed.

228
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,475
A demon killed his family,

229
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:18,063
except for his younger sister, who's been turned,

230
00:20:19,163 --> 00:20:21,403
but I'm certain she will not attack a human.

231
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:24,663
They're different.

232
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:27,913
I can sense something about these two.

233
00:20:29,046 --> 00:20:32,728
The boy has a keen sense of smell, much like yourself.

234
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:36,973
So maybe, just maybe,

235
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,430
he'll be able to find a way to break through.

236
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,925
I'm asking for you to train this boy.

237
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:47,429
This may seem like a frivolous request, but

238
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:49,839
please, humor me.

239
00:20:51,743 --> 00:20:52,951
If I'm not mistaken,

240
00:20:53,729 --> 00:20:55,381
this will all make sense one day.

241
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:58,195
Take care of yourself.

242
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:02,125
Yours truly, Giyu Tomioka.

243
00:21:20,774 --> 00:21:25,278
You're now my new student, Tanjiro Kamado.
