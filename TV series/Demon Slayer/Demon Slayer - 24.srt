1
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:08,923
Heading into battle?

2
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:14,579
Ah, Kocho! We got new intel on a demon.

3
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:21,486
The slayer who found it was defeated. We're
losing rank and filers now. We have to act!

4
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:23,883
Could it be a Twelve Kizuki?

5
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,190
Most likely. Maybe an upper rank.

6
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:33,383
It sounds like a difficult mission, but as long
as you're going, Rengoku, we don't have to worry.

7
00:00:34,586 --> 00:00:38,204
And you? What's the plan, taking that head-butting kid in?

8
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:42,500
You had mentioned recruiting more
Tsuguko, but I doubt that's the reason.

9
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,987
You seem concerned. You don't think
I'm going to gobble him up, do you?

10
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:48,747
Of course I don't!

11
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:55,742
Do be careful.

12
00:02:33,258 --> 00:02:37,593
No! I can't possibly take any more of this!

13
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:42,347
We go through this every day. Saying
you're in bad shape is an understatement.

14
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:44,480
Take your medicine this second!

15
00:02:47,337 --> 00:02:50,461
Good grief. Tanjiro, this medicine is for you.

16
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,436
Here you go.

17
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:53,768
Thank you very much.

18
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:03,255
Hey! I saw that medicine go down much
easier! So then, it's different from mine?

19
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:05,955
Favoritism! I call favoritism here!

20
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:09,263
Zenitsu, quiet down! This is a hospital ward!

21
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:10,754
You all seem lively.

22
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:14,320
Murata!

23
00:03:15,376 --> 00:03:15,994
Hey!

24
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:20,498
How have you been doing?

25
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,502
I came this close to getting
melted down, but I survived somehow.

26
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:27,612
I hear you guys got banged up pretty good, though.

27
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:30,254
Yeah, it's gonna take time for us to bounce back.

28
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:33,140
What was it that happened to you, boar kid?

29
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:36,285
Hmm? Is he sleeping or something?

30
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:40,282
He went through a lot. You should just let him be.

31
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:43,088
But for him, of all people, to be quiet...

32
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:43,994
Tanjiro!

33
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:44,549
Eh?

34
00:03:45,038 --> 00:03:47,204
Who is this?

35
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:50,390
He fought with us on mount Natagumo. He's a friend.

36
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,642
I'm Murata. Nice to meet you.

37
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,541
What happened to your arms?

38
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:59,051
My limbs shrunk down, because I
was almost turned into a spider.

39
00:03:59,183 --> 00:04:01,583
And that's why you need to take this medicine.

40
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:06,603
Agh! But it tastes so gross! There's
only so much gross a person can take!

41
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:09,347
Don't come crying to me if
your arms don't go back to normal!

42
00:04:09,504 --> 00:04:12,014
So cruel! That's such a cruel thing to say!

43
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,682
You don't know how good you have it!

44
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:18,713
You realize, if you take this medicine and get lots
of sunlight, there'll be no lasting effects, don't you?

45
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:24,532
I can't do it! None of that changes
the fact that stuff tastes awful!

46
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:26,972
Sounds like fun. Lucky you.

47
00:04:27,282 --> 00:04:28,331
What do you mean?

48
00:04:29,058 --> 00:04:34,704
I was summoned to the Hashira meeting to give my report
on everything that related to the mount Natagumo incident.

49
00:04:35,246 --> 00:04:39,321
It felt like hell. Those
Hashira are absolutely terrifying!

50
00:04:39,517 --> 00:04:44,535
They were all really furious about how the
quality of the new demon slayers had gone downhill,

51
00:04:45,122 --> 00:04:49,730
because there were a number of us who neglected
to follow orders during what happened up there.

52
00:04:50,278 --> 00:04:53,358
They were asking me things
like, "who trained them, anyway?"

53
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:58,113
What good was it asking a no-rank
like me into a meeting like that?

54
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:02,877
The Hashira really terrify me.

55
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:04,506
Hello there.

56
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:07,836
Lady... Lady Kocho!

57
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,012
Good day to you.

58
00:05:09,193 --> 00:05:11,112
You as well! Goodbye!

59
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,061
Oh, my. Leaving so soon?

60
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,749
The two of you, how are you feeling?

61
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:20,005
I think we're a lot better now.

62
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:24,967
Well, if that's the case, let's have
you start your rehabilitation training.

63
00:05:25,852 --> 00:05:28,019
Our "rehabilitation training"?

64
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:29,183
Yes!

65
00:05:29,744 --> 00:05:31,937
Forgive me for being weak.

66
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:40,112
Tanjiro and Inosuke were taken away by Lady Kocho,
and started something called rehabilitation training.

67
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:47,157
The sound Shinobu gives off is totally
unique. I don't think I've heard anything like it.

68
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:50,658
There's something about it that's a little unnerving.

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,175
But when she was treating the people who
got turned into spiders, she seemed ethereal.

70
00:05:56,805 --> 00:05:59,297
It's no wonder everyone ran to her in tears.

71
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:04,928
Doesn't hurt she's as pretty as a picture.
I bet she could get by on her looks alone.

72
00:06:05,937 --> 00:06:13,418
So Lady Kocho took Tanjiro and Inosuke to rehabilitation
training to rebuild their strength, which means...

73
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,306
They're gonna come back looking like that.

74
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:21,702
Hey, welcome back, you two!

75
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,197
How did it go today?

76
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:29,140
What's the matter? Did something happen?

77
00:06:30,077 --> 00:06:30,957
Sorry.

78
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:33,457
Don't mind us.

79
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:40,024
Please tell me! I'm gonna be in the same boat as you
two starting tomorrow! I need to be mentally prepared!

80
00:06:40,145 --> 00:06:41,462
Please!

81
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:51,212
Scared. Scared. I'm so scared! I don't wanna go!

82
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:58,071
All right, Zenitsu, since you'll be joining us
starting today, I will explain the training regimen again.

83
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,312
You will begin there.

84
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:03,404
Those girls will get your bedridden bodies limber again.

85
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:11,074
Next, reflex training.

86
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:13,937
These cups contain medicated water.

87
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:19,589
The objective is to throw that water
onto the other person, but there's a twist.

88
00:07:20,248 --> 00:07:23,186
Your opponent is able to block
you from picking up your cup.

89
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:26,050
Go!

90
00:07:27,326 --> 00:07:27,904
Again!

91
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,347
Go!

92
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:32,113
That's enough!

93
00:07:33,024 --> 00:07:34,794
Last, full-body training.

94
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:37,854
Or put simply, a game of tag.

95
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:41,707
You will face myself, Aoi, and then Kanao.

96
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:47,109
Excuse me. May I say something?

97
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:49,935
Hmm? Is there something not clear?

98
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:51,654
No, not that.

99
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:53,841
You two, come with me.

100
00:07:54,316 --> 00:07:55,546
Don't feel like it.

101
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:59,229
I won't ask twice! Shut up, and follow me!

102
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:01,270
Now!

103
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:05,266
You're coming with me, you little
urchins! I got an earful for you!

104
00:08:05,723 --> 00:08:07,511
What the hell are you doing?

105
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:13,997
All right, you two, sit up
straight! You miserable bastards!

106
00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:15,865
What did you say to us?

107
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:19,441
Inosuke!

108
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:24,839
What are you thinking?! Apologize to Inosuke!

109
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:34,617
Huh?! Me apologize?! You're the ones acting like
you came back from hell when you were in paradise!

110
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:40,890
All you did was frolic with girls all day, so
why did you come back looking all haggard like that?

111
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,359
Apologize! Then drop dead!

112
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:44,960
How can you say such a thing?

113
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:49,243
Shut up, you goody-goody, giant
forehead! Listen to what I have to say!

114
00:08:49,901 --> 00:08:55,445
You get to have beautiful girls giving you
massages! You touch their hands during that cup game!

115
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:01,785
And when you play tag, you can touch more than that! All
girls have nice chests, great butts, and strong thighs!

116
00:09:01,913 --> 00:09:06,606
They smell so nice when they pass by, and just
getting to look at them makes my heartbeat quicken!

117
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:10,748
They're heaven, absolute, utter heaven!

118
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:13,027
Knock it off! You're not making any sense!

119
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,793
Isn't getting all shook up by something
smaller than you a real blow to your confidence?

120
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:22,331
That's right! You were raised in the mountains,
so you've never been close to a girl, have you?!

121
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,001
No wonder you're a late bloomer! I feel so sorry for you!

122
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:27,339
That's it!

123
00:09:27,605 --> 00:09:31,072
I've been close to girls, and
none of them were a match for me!

124
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:32,652
I'm not talking about fighting!

125
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:35,089
Bad, bad, bad! You'll never pick up a girl at this rate!

126
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:36,098
What do you mean?

127
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:38,177
There's no way they can be that heavy!

128
00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:43,219
I look forward to training with you!

129
00:09:51,754 --> 00:09:53,589
Keep going. This is fine.

130
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:56,788
I have underestimated him.

131
00:09:57,034 --> 00:10:01,036
I always fight back tears from
the pain, but he's laughing from joy.

132
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:04,031
I shall take you on.

133
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:05,902
And go!

134
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,059
I would never throw a drink in a girl's face.

135
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,766
Now then, we will commence the full-body training!

136
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:21,794
I win!

137
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:25,667
I may have won the battle, but I lost the war.

138
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:28,530
I wanna win, too! All right!

139
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,322
Take this!

140
00:10:30,347 --> 00:10:31,487
Let me down!

141
00:10:32,374 --> 00:10:34,774
I'm the only one on a losing streak now.

142
00:10:34,892 --> 00:10:36,329
So embarrassing.

143
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:40,964
But no matter what I do, I can't beat Kanao.

144
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:46,322
None of us can get to our cup
first or block her from using her own.

145
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,727
For the next five days, I continued to lose to her.

146
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:56,267
So did Inosuke... And Zenitsu.

147
00:10:57,595 --> 00:11:00,810
We couldn't so much as lay a
finger on a strand of her hair.

148
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:04,559
Then one day, the other two stopped coming.

149
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:07,976
Z-Zenitsu? Inosuke?

150
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:12,191
Please train me!

151
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,647
Thank you for a good workout.

152
00:11:22,407 --> 00:11:26,301
Why can't I beat her? What gives her an edge over me?

153
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:33,659
First of all, her reflexes are way faster.
I'd probably still lose at full strength.

154
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:37,694
Her scent is totally different. It's
similar to the scent of the Hashira.

155
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:38,583
Tanjiro?

156
00:11:39,385 --> 00:11:44,163
Also her eyes, her eyes are different somehow.

157
00:11:44,462 --> 00:11:48,487
'Scuse me. Tanjiro are... are you all right?

158
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,988
We've been calling to you over and over.

159
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:54,060
Oh! I'm sorry. What is it?

160
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,412
This is for you.

161
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:03,226
Thank you! This helps! You're all so kind!

162
00:12:04,855 --> 00:12:10,793
Um, I wanted to ask if you keep up the total
concentration breathing state all of the time.

163
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:18,210
Do you use the total concentration breathing
technique nonstop, morning, noon, and while you're asleep?

164
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:25,020
Uh, can't say I do. Never thought
to. Can someone pull that off?

165
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:31,222
Yes! We're told that being able to do such a thing
makes all the difference in the whole, wide world!

166
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:35,982
Even just using that technique for a
short period of time really takes a toll.

167
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:38,655
But I should do it around the clock, huh?

168
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:42,065
Some people have already been able to master it.

169
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,607
All the Hashira and Kanao, too!

170
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:46,909
We hope you can do it!

171
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,202
Is that so? Thank you! I'll give it a try.

172
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,015
I think you should come back to training, Inosuke.

173
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:11,692
Feeling sorry for yourself won't
do you any good. You, too, Zenitsu.

174
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:15,383
Well, those were good times for me.

175
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:21,635
Tell them my injury's gotten worse. Hey, there,
Kakushi lady! Would you like to have some tea with me?

176
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:36,379
Total concentration breathing... Morning, noon, and
night. I said I'd try to keep it up around the clock.

177
00:13:39,336 --> 00:13:42,215
Nope. I can't do it! Not even close!

178
00:13:43,362 --> 00:13:47,405
If I try to do it longer than usual,
it makes me feel like I'm gonna die!

179
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:53,777
It's too painful. My lungs hurt! My ears are
ringing so hard, it feels like they're gonna burst!

180
00:13:53,802 --> 00:13:54,866
Wait. Did they?

181
00:13:58,347 --> 00:14:00,815
Ugh. That was so scary!

182
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:04,623
For a second there, I thought my
heart had burst out through my ears!

183
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:07,476
I'll never be able to do it at this rate.

184
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,641
When you're in trouble, go back to the basics!

185
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:12,612
Get it together, me!

186
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:24,018
Breathing is all about the lungs. If I can't
grasp it, that means my lungs are too weak.

187
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,902
Work at it! It's the only thing I
can do! That's how it's always been!

188
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:36,473
Hard work is the sum of daily efforts. It
can be one step at a time. Just move forward!

189
00:14:36,954 --> 00:14:37,449
Move!

190
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,785
Look at him go! He's working hard, isn't he?

191
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:44,532
Yeah! Let's bring him some rice balls, okay?

192
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:47,037
Good idea! And also...

193
00:14:48,077 --> 00:14:49,942
Blow into these gourds?

194
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:57,601
Yeah, that's right! Lady Kocho trained miss Kanao, and
whenever she did, she had her blow into gourds like these.

195
00:14:57,762 --> 00:14:58,728
Really?

196
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:04,140
That's a neat training technique.
So do you make a sound or something?

197
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:08,613
Oh, no. She blew into it and
made the gourd go all ka-boom!

198
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:10,306
Wow!

199
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:12,036
Ka-boom?

200
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:14,865
Wait. This thing, explode?

201
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:18,144
Something this hard?

202
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,979
That's right! Not to mention,
this is a special kind of gourd,

203
00:15:22,306 --> 00:15:24,611
so it's even harder than normal ones.

204
00:15:24,952 --> 00:15:28,328
A girl that delicate was able
to pull off something like that?!

205
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,505
Did I mention the gourds get
bigger and bigger as you progress?

206
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:36,139
The one that lady Kanao is able to explode right now...

207
00:15:37,763 --> 00:15:39,116
Is this one right here.

208
00:15:39,224 --> 00:15:42,025
It's huge! I'll give it a shot!

209
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:45,217
They're not coming today, either?

210
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:49,817
'Fraid not. I'll bring them tomorrow. Sorry.

211
00:15:50,386 --> 00:15:53,698
It's fine. Don't concern yourself with those two anymore!

212
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:55,825
I'll do my best.

213
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:56,984
Here I go!

214
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:03,820
I've been running Urokodaki's drills while
maintaining my total concentration breathing.

215
00:16:05,807 --> 00:16:09,548
While racing around here, I imagine
I'm at the mountains back home.

216
00:16:12,423 --> 00:16:16,125
And instead of these obstacles,
they're the trees I used to avoid.

217
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:21,380
Keep at it! Keep at it! Keep at it!

218
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:27,517
I've regained most of my stamina, and
now I can run farther than I did before,

219
00:16:27,658 --> 00:16:30,942
and my lungs are getting stronger, too! This is good.

220
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:36,608
During the day, I cover a lot of
distance and put my lungs into overdrive.

221
00:16:37,393 --> 00:16:43,170
And now I'll take slow, deep breaths and imagine
sending that air all the way to my fingertips.

222
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:49,332
Meditation boosts concentration.
Urokodaki said so himself.

223
00:16:51,173 --> 00:16:52,369
Urokodaki.

224
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:57,195
I can't believe you'd go and break my sword like that!

225
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,280
I'm so sorry.

226
00:17:00,136 --> 00:17:05,314
They're reforging my sword for me
now, but I still feel terrible about it.

227
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:10,466
Now's not the time to be thinking
about that! Concentrate on your breathing!

228
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:13,430
Yoo-hoo! Hello!

229
00:17:14,477 --> 00:17:16,653
Yoo-hoo! Hello.

230
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:17,960
Yes?!

231
00:17:18,131 --> 00:17:19,946
Working hard, I see.

232
00:17:22,285 --> 00:17:25,034
Even though your friends didn't end up joining you.

233
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,773
Aren't you lonely all by yourself?

234
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:34,664
No way! Once I've mastered it,
I can teach it to them myself!

235
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:38,539
You have a beautiful soul, don't you?

236
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:47,148
So, uh, why did you decide to
bring us all here in the first place?

237
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:55,090
Nezuko's presence is no longer considered taboo,
and the three of you had been terribly injured.

238
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:03,100
Additionally, if I could, I'd like
to entrust a dream of mine to you.

239
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:04,850
A dream?

240
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,257
Yes.

241
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,946
That we can befriend the demons.
I'm sure you can accomplish that.

242
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:20,876
Are you angry?

243
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:27,626
For some reason, I always pick up a scent
of anger, even though you're always smiling.

244
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:38,047
Yes. You are correct. It may be that I'm constantly angry.

245
00:18:39,362 --> 00:18:42,456
My beloved older sister was slaughtered by a demon.

246
00:18:43,886 --> 00:18:48,152
I see the mournful tears of others who've
lost their loved ones in the same way.

247
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:57,879
I hear their loud cries of despair, and each
time I do, the anguish inside me grows larger.

248
00:18:58,982 --> 00:19:03,659
In the innermost depths of my soul,
there's a hatred that I can't fight.

249
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:07,919
I'm sure the other Hashira feel something similar.

250
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:15,107
But now, with their own eyes, they've
seen a demon who's never devoured a human.

251
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:23,433
They can't deny her existence. Due to the master's wishes,
I don't believe anyone will raise a hand to Nezuko.

252
00:19:29,072 --> 00:19:35,438
My sister was a kindhearted person
like you. She had sympathy for demons.

253
00:19:36,278 --> 00:19:39,698
Even when she was on the brink
of death, that didn't change.

254
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:43,210
I couldn't bring myself to feel that way.

255
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:49,453
To do so for something that's killed
us? I'd never heard of such nonsense.

256
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:56,043
But if that was how my sister
truly felt, then I must carry it on.

257
00:19:57,102 --> 00:20:00,205
If there is a way not to kill these pitiful demons,

258
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:06,474
I have to keep trying to find it while
keeping the smile my sister said she loved.

259
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:08,950
Sister!

260
00:20:10,387 --> 00:20:14,482
No! Stay with me!

261
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,889
I have to admit I'm rather tired.

262
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:31,207
Demons do nothing but lie. They only fight to survive,
murdering us, and do so without any shred of humanity.

263
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:41,100
Tanjiro, please do all you can.
Protect your sister until the end.

264
00:20:42,836 --> 00:20:50,737
Knowing that you're working hard to carry out what
I could not, it warms my heart. I can rest easy now.

265
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:57,610
You've stopped your total concentration breathing.

266
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:06,232
Focus.

267
00:21:07,428 --> 00:21:09,334
Total concentration breathing.

268
00:21:14,177 --> 00:21:18,860
Mother, Hanako... Takeo, Shigeru... Rokuta...

269
00:21:22,342 --> 00:21:25,119
I will turn Nezuko back into a human!
