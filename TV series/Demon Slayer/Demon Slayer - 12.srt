1
00:00:01,774 --> 00:00:06,148
Hope you're ready for me, 'cause I'm comin' through!

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,141
It's all so infuriating!

3
00:00:15,863 --> 00:00:16,783
Teruko!

4
00:00:16,936 --> 00:00:18,536
Hold on to the furniture!

5
00:00:19,996 --> 00:00:21,881
That demon has special powers!

6
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:24,220
You shouldn't be attacking so recklessly!

7
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:08,822
How maddening,

8
00:02:09,492 --> 00:02:12,665
all these cursed insects running amok in my house.

9
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,294
I can't believe the room spun around!

10
00:02:29,422 --> 00:02:32,045
Now, this is what I call a fun time!

11
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:37,896
Get your dirty feet off of her!

12
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,898
Who the hell are you, kid?

13
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:45,642
Stepping on a little kid like that!

14
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:46,844
What are you thinking?!

15
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:51,190
You got spunk. I like that.

16
00:02:51,517 --> 00:02:55,153
Having a human send me flying, that's a first for me!

17
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:58,731
Why is he coming after me?

18
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:00,380
Isn't he a demon slayer?

19
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,872
These swords do a lot of damage.

20
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:07,587
They're not the kind you
delicate little flowers would use.

21
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:12,216
The way they shred through flesh
is what I pride myself on the most.

22
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,866
This is foolish! There's a demon right there!

23
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:17,221
You think I care?! Hah!

24
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:19,420
Measly insects.

25
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,535
You're irksome. Now die!

26
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:27,647
The floor just ripped apart.

27
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,902
It happened at the speed of the beat of the drum

28
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:33,219
and in the shape of a beast's claws!

29
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,632
Rotating right.

30
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:41,916
Back left.

31
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:44,208
Insects.

32
00:03:44,894 --> 00:03:46,460
Miserable vermin!

33
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,349
I'm starting to understand.

34
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:01,563
We're in another room now?

35
00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:04,517
But that demon didn't strike his drum,

36
00:04:05,274 --> 00:04:06,575
so what does this mean?

37
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:11,198
I'm picking up the scent of multiple demons in this house.

38
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:13,848
Is there another demon with a drum, then?

39
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,074
Is that why

40
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:20,773
I can smell blood.

41
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:23,788
It's gonna be fine.

42
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:25,946
You just stay behind me.

43
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:38,152
Another human mauled and eaten.

44
00:04:40,318 --> 00:04:41,533
Is something wrong?

45
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,801
No, we're fine. There's no demons.

46
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:46,806
Come on. Let's head out.

47
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:52,132
Keep your eyes forward, all right? Don't look behind you.

48
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,785
I smell something else,

49
00:04:58,613 --> 00:05:01,697
a unique scent of blood that I've never smelled before.

50
00:05:03,075 --> 00:05:05,321
Seems like there wasn't much bleeding.

51
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:37,828
Excuse me. Can we stop, Zenitsu?

52
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:49,262
You gotta warn me first before you speak up!

53
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:52,265
You can't go surprising me like that here!

54
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,655
My heart nearly jumped out of my mouth just now!

55
00:05:57,494 --> 00:05:58,840
Sorry about that.

56
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,117
If I had a heart attack, you
would have been directly responsible!

57
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:04,535
You'd be a murderer! Do you understand?!

58
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:06,521
Well, it's just that...

59
00:06:06,982 --> 00:06:10,119
You've been sweating, gasping, and shivering really badly.

60
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:11,407
What about it?!

61
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:13,890
I'm doing the best I can here, all right?!

62
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,883
Um, forgive me for saying so,

63
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:19,582
but you're making me really nervous, too.

64
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:21,485
Oh, no! I'm sorry!

65
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,993
It's just I feel if we make too much noise here,

66
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:27,749
that demon you saw,

67
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:29,302
it might find us, right?

68
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:34,364
That's why I think it would be best to
be as quiet as possible! Don't you think?!

69
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:44,620
A couple of kids.

70
00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:46,719
I bet you'll taste delicious.

71
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:49,660
What did I tell you?!

72
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:52,526
It's just my luck we'd run into a demon!

73
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:08,378
Stay away! Stay away from us! I'm warning you!

74
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:12,782
W-we don't taste good!

75
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:15,901
I'm sure I taste awful! I'm serious!

76
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,697
This kid's all skin and bones,

77
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:20,456
so he'd be dry and taste terrible!

78
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,061
How will I know for sure until I have a lick?

79
00:07:28,138 --> 00:07:31,733
Are you kidding me?! His tongue
is like a bolt of lighting!

80
00:07:33,738 --> 00:07:35,938
This has to be a nightmare!

81
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:42,078
Zenitsu, you've gotta get up!

82
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:46,276
My knees! My fear is in my knees!

83
00:07:46,684 --> 00:07:49,219
This isn't the time to complain about that stuff!

84
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,163
Just leave me behind, okay? Make a run for it!

85
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:55,958
I can't do something like that.

86
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,249
What a sweet kid.

87
00:07:59,394 --> 00:08:02,048
As useless as I am, he's sticking by me.

88
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,147
I gotta find a solution to this.

89
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,885
If I don't protect him, I don't
wanna think of what'll happen.

90
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:11,774
Dying before he reaches adulthood would be tragic.

91
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:14,027
But I'm so horribly weak.

92
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:15,137
Get up!

93
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,464
I don't have the strength to protect him.

94
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:20,395
But, if I don't, then that would mean

95
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,646
I'm going to relish using my tongue to
scoop your brains out through your ears.

96
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:34,154
Zenitsu!

97
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,913
Are you...

98
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:42,480
He's asleep.

99
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:47,570
What's up with him?

100
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:00,981
Die!

101
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:03,514
Please wake up!

102
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:06,228
Zenitsu!

103
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:40,441
Wh-what is this sound?

104
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:44,103
This boy, he's not the same as before.

105
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:46,615
Zenitsu?

106
00:09:50,408 --> 00:09:51,610
Thunder breathing...

107
00:09:51,814 --> 00:09:52,946
First form.

108
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:54,887
Thunderclap and flash.

109
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:16,846
It's dead?!

110
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:21,971
When did that happen?! What the hell?! This is weird!

111
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,007
What is this? Yuck!

112
00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:31,312
Shoichi, did... did you just...

113
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:35,298
You saved me! Thank you so much!

114
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:37,743
I'll never forget that you did this!

115
00:10:37,922 --> 00:10:42,192
Why didn't you just tell me from
the start that you were so powerful?!

116
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,417
What are you talking about?

117
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,633
You say something?

118
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,993
Huh? No.

119
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,390
It's nothing.

120
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:57,523
We should go now.

121
00:10:57,942 --> 00:10:58,518
Yeah.

122
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:03,768
Damn it! He sent me flying again!

123
00:11:03,852 --> 00:11:06,518
These last three days, it's been the same old crap.

124
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:10,019
I don't like making my way
through a cramped building like this!

125
00:11:10,088 --> 00:11:11,662
It's just not my thing.

126
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:22,988
You dodged that.

127
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:25,671
You seem quite spry, human.

128
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:30,937
Your healthy flesh will be well worth gouging out to eat!

129
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:38,843
Self-taught style, beast breathing!

130
00:11:39,183 --> 00:11:43,373
It's gonna feel so good to rip
such a huge target to shreds!

131
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:47,922
You've got a lot of guts to charge me head-on like that!

132
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:57,688
Revel in your own death, and serve as my catalyst!

133
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,111
Fang three, devour!

134
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,130
Coming through! Coming through!

135
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:19,719
Marechi, I need it.

136
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:21,639
To devour even one,

137
00:12:22,426 --> 00:12:26,775
I would have as many as 50... Nay, 100 bodies worth.

138
00:12:27,231 --> 00:12:31,520
I must search for more humans
with Marechi and devour them.

139
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:38,501
In doing so, I will be able to
reclaim my place among the Twelve Kizuki.

140
00:12:48,623 --> 00:12:49,711
Kyogai.

141
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,365
Why have you stopped eating?

142
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:57,026
Have you reached your limit?

143
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:59,868
No, sir. I can go on!

144
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:08,311
P-Please! Give me just a little more time.

145
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:09,835
I think not.

146
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:15,820
I am stripping you of your number,
because you have nothing more to offer me.

147
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:20,660
The more humans you devour, the stronger you become.

148
00:13:21,553 --> 00:13:23,313
Once he saw my potential,

149
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:26,828
master Kibutsuji was willing to share his blood with me.

150
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:31,835
The power of that man's blood was simply astonishing.

151
00:13:32,402 --> 00:13:36,228
I was sure that I'd grow
infinitely stronger than ever before

152
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:40,409
and recognized into the ranks of the Twelve Kizuki.

153
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:44,031
I would continue to gorge myself on humans

154
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:46,910
and steadily become even more powerful!

155
00:13:48,548 --> 00:13:50,341
Or so I believed.

156
00:13:50,936 --> 00:13:53,201
Kiyoshi, we found you!

157
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,987
Brother! Brother!

158
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:00,055
Teruko!

159
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:03,810
Who is he?

160
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,410
Tanjiro Kamado,

161
00:14:07,131 --> 00:14:08,723
and I'm a demon slayer.

162
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,630
You two have hung in there really well.

163
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:14,906
Can you show me your wounds?

164
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:19,633
Why, Kiyoshi?

165
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:27,579
This ointment here is really amazing!

166
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:30,438
My master gave it to me for a time like this!

167
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:33,130
Wanna know something funny?

168
00:14:33,357 --> 00:14:35,024
He always wears a tengu mask.

169
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,063
A tengu? Really?

170
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:38,452
It's the truth.

171
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:41,112
Anyway, this ointment is fantastic.

172
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,112
You'll feel better right away.

173
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:45,941
That'll do it!

174
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:49,193
Well? You feel better?

175
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:50,624
Yes.

176
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:55,262
Tell me exactly what happened if you can.

177
00:14:59,251 --> 00:15:02,578
A monster dragged me away, and...

178
00:15:03,154 --> 00:15:04,884
It nearly ate me.

179
00:15:05,634 --> 00:15:07,384
Mm, but then...

180
00:15:07,838 --> 00:15:10,133
Another one showed up out of nowhere.

181
00:15:10,989 --> 00:15:13,644
They started fighting to the death over...

182
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:18,644
Who was gonna get to e-eat me.

183
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,394
Then...

184
00:15:22,396 --> 00:15:24,911
The demon with the drums growing out of him...

185
00:15:26,344 --> 00:15:30,406
Left one of the drums behind
after he was defeated by the others.

186
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:35,551
When I picked it up and hit it, the room changed.

187
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:37,936
That's how I held out.

188
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:44,306
A demon with drums growing from him? That guy?

189
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:49,341
He said, I think, something about "Marechi."

190
00:15:50,728 --> 00:15:52,099
Yes, that's right!

191
00:15:52,436 --> 00:15:54,971
I don't know what it means, but he called me that!

192
00:15:57,047 --> 00:16:01,450
The term "Marechi" refers to
the owner of a rare type of blood!

193
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,986
What's that look?

194
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,986
I'll teach you respect!

195
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,736
Cut it out!

196
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:13,234
When you say, "rare blood," wh-what do you mean?

197
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:17,637
The blood of all living species
can be broken into types, you see?

198
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:19,329
The more scarce the blood...

199
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:21,597
Or the more uncommon it is, I should say...

200
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,999
The more desirable it is to demons,

201
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:28,182
for, you see, in terms of nutritional value for a demon,

202
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:33,182
a human Marechi is akin to eating
as many as a hundred normal humans.

203
00:16:34,115 --> 00:16:38,853
A Marechi is like a bountiful feast
for them, a delicacy for the ages.

204
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,620
Marechi. Marechi.

205
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:55,504
I'm gonna head out there.

206
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:59,124
Keep calm. It's all right.

207
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:01,321
I'm going to take down that demon.

208
00:17:02,892 --> 00:17:04,264
Teruko, listen to me.

209
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:05,289
Huh?

210
00:17:05,828 --> 00:17:09,978
Your brother is really worn out at the
moment, so watch after him, all right?

211
00:17:11,723 --> 00:17:13,223
Soon as I leave this room,

212
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:15,468
use the drum to change areas,

213
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:17,575
just like Kiyoshi's been doing.

214
00:17:18,377 --> 00:17:21,147
If someone tries to open the door or you hear something,

215
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:24,218
strike that drum to remove yourself from danger.

216
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:26,861
I promise that I'll come for you.

217
00:17:27,732 --> 00:17:29,419
I'll follow your scent back.

218
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,614
Then I'll call your names so you know it's me.

219
00:17:35,997 --> 00:17:37,707
Just hold out a little longer.

220
00:17:38,743 --> 00:17:39,707
Can you do it?

221
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:45,207
Great! So brave!

222
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:49,313
I'm off.

223
00:17:57,908 --> 00:17:58,813
Strike it!

224
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:05,201
Damn insects. So infuriating!

225
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,487
The right drum flips the room right.

226
00:18:26,502 --> 00:18:28,658
The left one flips it left.

227
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:31,422
Right leg, forward spin!

228
00:18:31,663 --> 00:18:33,596
Left leg, backward spin!

229
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,890
The drum on his belly launches that claw attack!

230
00:18:54,172 --> 00:18:55,439
So fast.

231
00:18:55,538 --> 00:18:58,273
The speed of the rotations and attacks are brutal!

232
00:18:59,074 --> 00:19:01,167
Miss Tamayo did treat my wounds,

233
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:03,773
but these injuries aren't fully healed yet.

234
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:07,628
Can I... can I beat him?

235
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:10,166
I'm in so much pain.

236
00:19:10,428 --> 00:19:12,869
I don't know how much longer I can hold on!

237
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:17,756
This whole time, I've just been grinning and bearing it.

238
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:21,116
When I pulled Zenitsu off that girl he was chasing,

239
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:23,370
when I shouted at him out of anger,

240
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:25,855
I was enduring the most terrible pain.

241
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:28,347
I had to withstand it.

242
00:19:29,187 --> 00:19:32,222
It was my duty as the eldest son of my family.

243
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:36,362
Whenever I tense up, my broken bones ache,

244
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,705
stopping me from mustering any strength.

245
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:45,068
That demon's attack is leaving
tears that look like claw marks.

246
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,709
I'm too scared to move in closer.

247
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:53,214
If I charge forward to get within striking distance,

248
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:56,214
I'm afraid that a flash of pain will make me falter.

249
00:19:56,506 --> 00:19:57,959
If that happens

250
00:20:00,762 --> 00:20:02,209
I'll be torn to shreds.

251
00:20:04,823 --> 00:20:07,755
I can't help but imagine the most awful things.

252
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:09,614
Help me!

253
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,609
Consider the characteristics of water.

254
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:18,315
Pour it into a container, and it's square.

255
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,402
Pour it into a bottle, and it's round.

256
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:24,816
It can smash boulders or flow as far as the eye can see.

257
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,879
Of course. That's right!

258
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:31,395
I remember. There are ten water breathing forms,

259
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:34,384
so I can adapt to any opponent.

260
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:38,631
If you're wounded, then you have to
make a move that will compensate for it.

261
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:43,136
I can take on any form, and
this flow will never be stopped!

262
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:49,951
More important than my bones, my spirit was broken.

263
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:54,574
That's not gonna do anyone any good!

264
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:57,131
Would you stay out of my head, please?!

265
00:20:58,102 --> 00:20:59,492
Look straight ahead.

266
00:21:00,678 --> 00:21:01,978
Steel yourself.

267
00:21:03,557 --> 00:21:05,498
Give it everything you've got.

268
00:21:06,082 --> 00:21:07,560
You can do it!

269
00:21:11,623 --> 00:21:13,747
I've been able to survive this long.

270
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,090
I know I have what it takes!

271
00:21:16,794 --> 00:21:19,813
Whether it's today or tomorrow,

272
00:21:20,365 --> 00:21:21,857
I can assure you this!

273
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,350
Without a shadow of doubt in my mind, I will not yield!
