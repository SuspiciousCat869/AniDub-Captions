1
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,764
[ELINALISE] It reeks
of sweat and pheromones.

2
00:00:24,848 --> 00:00:26,641
How simply marvelous!

3
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:28,810
Don't you think, Talhand?

4
00:00:29,728 --> 00:00:30,854
No, but your shamelessness

5
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:33,565
is so brazen it's
almost refreshing.

6
00:00:33,648 --> 00:00:35,316
[ROXY] Elinalise,
we're not here for you

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,609
to find a man, remember?

8
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:38,903
Yeah, yeah,
Paul's family, I got it.

9
00:00:38,987 --> 00:00:40,864
But we have time
for a little fun.

10
00:00:40,947 --> 00:00:44,034
[sighs] And what, pray tell,
does she expect us to do

11
00:00:44,117 --> 00:00:47,412
if she winds up pregnant
by the time we leave town?

12
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,584
Look at that!

13
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:35,960
It seems you're
fairly popular with

14
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:38,546
the younger ones in
your own right, Roxy!

15
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,173
Not in that way.

16
00:01:40,256 --> 00:01:41,966
And even if I was,
I don't have the time

17
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,427
to waste on romance right now.

18
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:58,900
[ROXY]
Uh, hey.

19
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:05,907
[ALL laughing]

20
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,284
[ROXY]
Would you please knock it off?

21
00:02:13,498 --> 00:02:15,750
[ROXY] It just occurred to me
that I've never asked.

22
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:16,751
You were both members of

23
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:19,045
the Fangs of the
Black Wolf, right?

24
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:21,131
What were Paul and
Zenith like back then?

25
00:02:21,214 --> 00:02:22,090
Paul was scum.

26
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:23,299
Walking garbage.

27
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:24,467
[ROXY]
Really?

28
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:25,385
[ELINALISE]
If it's all the same to you,

29
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:27,554
I'd rather not discuss the man.

30
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:29,097
[ROXY]
And yet, you're both out here

31
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,099
helping me look for him.

32
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:34,602
Sounds like you care
far more than you let on.

33
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:37,439
Still. What in the world
could he have done

34
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:39,983
for a reaction like that?

35
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,822
[ROXY]
Dead End.

36
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:10,907
There's not a soul alive
on this continent

37
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,743
that doesn't know
that devil's name.

38
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:16,746
He's especially dangerous,
even for a Superd.

39
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,915
And as the name implies,
it's said that

40
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:23,420
none who cross his path have
ever lived to tell the tale.

41
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:25,672
You already lost me.
I thought that was a party name.

42
00:04:25,755 --> 00:04:27,173
Can you keep up with
the discussion for

43
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:28,967
more than 15 seconds at a time?

44
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,052
Dead End is a real person!

45
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:32,679
And it seems
a party of adventurers

46
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:35,682
has been using that name
ever since the mana disaster.

47
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:38,685
So that's who we've been
hearing about all day.

48
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:40,937
But I don't think
it's a coincidence.

49
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:43,606
Well, I know which one
I'd like to question.

50
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,235
Give me that tall, fair spearman
who wears a permanent scowl.

51
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:49,904
I could take him to bed
and get plenty out of him.

52
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:51,614
Same priorities as ever.

53
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:53,992
I at least learned
their party dynamics.

54
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:55,869
"Mad Dog Eris" is
a red-haired swordsman

55
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:58,288
with a furious blade and temper.

56
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:00,165
"Guard Dog Ruijerd"
loves children

57
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:02,625
and never turns
a blind eye to evil.

58
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:04,961
And their leader,
"Kennel Master Rudyjerd,"

59
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:09,174
is a tiny little mage who's
perpetually up to no good.

60
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:11,301
Their reputation as
a whole isn't great,

61
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:14,012
but they say
the Guard Dog's all right.

62
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:15,638
Now that's interesting.

63
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:18,767
Superd are usually
melee fighters, not mages.

64
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,896
And they don't have red hair,
much less a sense of justice.

65
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:26,441
In any case, I think
we should take care

66
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:28,485
to give them
a fairly wide berth.

67
00:05:28,568 --> 00:05:30,779
If even one of them
is the real Dead End,

68
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:33,490
getting too involved
with them would be suicide.

69
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:36,743
[TALHAND] Aye. We don't need to
draw attention from riffraff

70
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:39,496
like that when we're
tryin' to help folks.

71
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,748
[ROXY]
Speaking of which, we need to

72
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,458
touch base on the main mission.

73
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,251
Did you pick up on
any leads or rumors

74
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:48,338
about the Fittoa
displacement survivors?

75
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:49,547
[TALHAND]
Not a one.

76
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:51,383
[ELINALISE]
Total wash on anything useful.

77
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:54,135
It's been a year
since they teleported.

78
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:57,180
I wonder if we're just
too late to save them.

79
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:01,976
Although, we are talking
about the Greyrats, here,

80
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,895
so they should be okay!

81
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:05,105
Zenith, yes.

82
00:06:05,188 --> 00:06:07,315
Lilia, Aisha,
and Rudeus, though.

83
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,983
I'm not so sure.

84
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,486
Zenith can handle stuff
like this in her sleep.

85
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:15,365
She may have long since retired,
but she was an S-ranked cleric.

86
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:18,410
And Rudeus stands out,
so he should be easy to find,

87
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:20,370
provided he's alive.

88
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:25,375
So I guess we should focus
our efforts on Lilia and Aisha.

89
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,710
Sounds like a plan.

90
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:29,254
I'll set out in the morning
to search for intel.

91
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:30,922
As will I.

92
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:36,636
[ROXY] I appreciate that
very much. Thank you.

93
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:49,816
--[BOY 13B] Yeah!
--[BOY 13A] Over here!

94
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:51,735
[BOY 13A]
Come on, hurry up!

95
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:56,906
[ROXY] It's been six years
since I left Buena Village.

96
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,616
I wonder how much
Rudy has grown.

97
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,785
[clanking]

98
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:01,828
[gasps]

99
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,377
[ROXY] A red-headed swordsman
and a tall, bald spearman.

100
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:11,212
I wonder if they're
from "Dead End."

101
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:15,008
And if they are, where the
tiny Kennel Master might be.

102
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:22,140
[ROXY]
They're both so strong.

103
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:24,726
Don't tell me they
really are Superd.

104
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:40,575
[ROXY]
Th-Those eyes.

105
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,210
[ROXY]
They wouldn't attack me just for

106
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:51,878
watching them train, would they?

107
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:55,882
[ELINALISE moans] Yes! Don't
stop, you hairy stinky beasts!

108
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:57,509
Put a baby in me!

109
00:07:57,592 --> 00:08:01,638
[ELINALISE moaning]

110
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:04,933
[ELINALISE] Why, Roxy,
when did you get back?

111
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:07,519
You're welcome to
join us, if you like.

112
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:10,814
[moans]

113
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:12,649
[ELINALISE]
Who said stop, you idiot?

114
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:15,527
[ELINALISE moaning]

115
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,654
[gasps]

116
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:18,988
Hey! Wait!

117
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:22,867
[ROXY] Icicle Break!
Icicle Break! Icicle Break!

118
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:25,036
[ELINALISE]
Calm down, would you?

119
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:36,131
Those repairs were steep.

120
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:38,591
We'll have to watch
our spending for a while.

121
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:41,803
I wish we at least had
some intel to show for it.

122
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:44,222
I hope you realize
it's your fault we don't.

123
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:46,850
I was admirably
performing my duties

124
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:50,520
and simply happened to receive
an enticing invitation.

125
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:52,313
Well, you still didn't have to.

126
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:54,899
You know what I mean?
There were five of them!

127
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:57,444
You'll understand
one day, sweetheart.

128
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:58,987
It's not every day
that a strong,

129
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,406
beautiful adventurer like me
gets to melt helplessly

130
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:03,783
into the arms of
thugs like them.

131
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:05,076
Ugh, just thinking about it

132
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,203
is almost enough
to get me pregnant.

133
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:08,997
[ROXY]
I don't need to know that.

134
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,374
[ELINALISE] Oh, you'll lighten
up after you've had your first.

135
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,544
I can help you find him!
Why not join me next time--

136
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:16,129
That's never going to happen.

137
00:09:16,212 --> 00:09:17,505
[TALHAND sighs]

138
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:19,090
I know how I'll find him:

139
00:09:19,174 --> 00:09:21,593
in the dark depths of
a dangerous labyrinth.

140
00:09:21,676 --> 00:09:24,512
When all hope seems lost,
he'll come to my rescue.

141
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:27,891
A tall and slender young man
with boyish charm.

142
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:30,101
We'll combine our strength
to fight our way out,

143
00:09:30,185 --> 00:09:32,687
and that's when our love
will bud and blossom,

144
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:35,357
and then, by the time
we manage to escape...

145
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,693
[ELINALISE chuckles]
Goodness, you're such a child.

146
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:41,488
Ahem! Forget I said anything!

147
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:44,240
Let's just focus on
getting to the next town!

148
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:46,201
[ELINALISE]
Yes, ma'am.

149
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:01,299
[RUDEUS]
Gallus' terms were as follows:

150
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,677
He would smuggle
Ruijerd to Zant Port

151
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,804
if we agreed to liberate
some "stolen goods"

152
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:07,639
for him upon arrival.

153
00:10:07,722 --> 00:10:11,935
He's kind of a sketchy guy,
but I didn't have many options.

154
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:20,318
[RUDEUS] If I know dating sims,
and I think I do,

155
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:23,738
a sea voyage is the perfect
place for a major event!

156
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:26,408
An octopus, squid,
sea serpent, pirates?

157
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,535
Maybe a ghost ship?

158
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:32,205
Something like that will
sink us and set us adrift.

159
00:10:32,288 --> 00:10:33,957
Then the love interest
and I wash up

160
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,127
on a desert island and
start a new life together.

161
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,962
At first, she won't
be able to stand me,

162
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:41,548
but as the days draw on,
her heart will soften,

163
00:10:41,631 --> 00:10:43,883
and soon she'll fall for me.

164
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:48,388
And once that happens, well,
you know what happens next.

165
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,642
[RUDEUS]
Our eyes meet.

166
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:55,979
[RUDEUS]
Our passion kindles.

167
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:58,732
Our hearts pound!
Our sweat flies!

168
00:10:58,815 --> 00:11:00,275
The surf roars!

169
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:01,735
I make a cup of coffee.

170
00:11:01,818 --> 00:11:03,862
And we live happily ever after.

171
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:08,992
[BOTH laughing]

172
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:12,203
[RUDEUS]
Unfortunately, reality is cruel.

173
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:14,039
[ERIS retches]

174
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:28,845
Rudeus. Am I gonna die?
You can be honest.

175
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:30,180
[RUDEUS]
If you die of seasickness,

176
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:32,057
I will make fun of you.

177
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:44,861
Sorry, I'll be back in a sec.
I gotta go hit the head.

178
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:48,406
[ERIS]
'Kay, good luck.

179
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,418
[RUDEUS sighs]

180
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:04,589
You smell funny now.

181
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:26,695
[ERIS]
I'm so glad we made it.

182
00:12:26,778 --> 00:12:29,656
I'm never gonna
get on a boat again.

183
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:31,658
You say that,
but we'll have to take one

184
00:12:31,741 --> 00:12:33,660
from here to the Central
Continent eventually,

185
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:35,495
so get ready.

186
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:39,874
[ERIS] No. Will you cast Healing
on me the whole way again?

187
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,459
[RUDEUS]
If you want, but I might hafta

188
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:43,795
do somethin' naughty to you.

189
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:47,173
[ERIS groans]
Please don't tease me like that.

190
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,927
[RUDEUS] I am not teasing!
I'm controlling myself!

191
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:53,430
[RUDEUS] Hey, it's all I can do
to keep myself in check.

192
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:55,598
[ERIS]
Well, that's fine, I guess.

193
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:57,684
You can touch me
a little bit next time

194
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,185
if you really want to.

195
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:02,063
[RUDEUS] Yeah, no, sorry,
"a little" isn't gonna cut it.

196
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:05,316
Let's just wait until you're
ready to get real messed up.

197
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:08,445
Anyway.

198
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:10,905
It's about time
to go pick up Ruijerd.

199
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,366
Are you good to
hold down the fort?

200
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,994
[ERIS]
Yup. You got it.

201
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:19,289
[RUDEUS] Don't give me
a chance to cave, Eris.

202
00:13:19,372 --> 00:13:21,541
Let me keep my promise!

203
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:26,588
[RUDEUS yells]

204
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:59,120
[SMUGGLER 13A]
He wouldn't quit wailin', so I

205
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:01,414
wound up having to
off the bastard.

206
00:14:01,498 --> 00:14:03,291
[SMUGGLER 13B laughs]
Pay up, chump!

207
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,877
[SMUGGLER 13C]
Go easy on me next time, man.

208
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,463
[RUDEUS]
What an elaborate hideout.

209
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:11,007
I guess that's career
criminals for you.

210
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:21,351
[RUDEUS]
That dog is huge.

211
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:22,727
[SMUGGLER 13D]
What're you starin' at?

212
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:24,729
Sorry, forgot my manners.

213
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:27,232
[PRISONER 13A cries]

214
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:29,776
[SMUGGLER 13E] Enough already,
you annoying little shit.

215

[PRISONER 13A crying]

217
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:39,160
[SMUGGLER 13E]
Ugh, dammit.

218
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:42,539
[thudding]

219
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:52,632
[SMUGGLER 13F]
Here you go.

220
00:14:56,636 --> 00:15:01,766
[RUDEUS] You did great, Ruijerd.
Thanks for being so patient.

221
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,019
[RUIJERD]
Rudeus, listen close.

222
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:07,564
[RUIJERD]
There are captive children here.

223
00:15:07,647 --> 00:15:09,149
Five of them.

224
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:13,695
There were six, but they killed
one for crying too loudly.

225
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:17,240
Are they the "goods"
we're liberating?

226
00:15:17,323 --> 00:15:19,117
Who else do they
have chained up?

227
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,660
[RUIJERD]
It's just them.

228
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:22,996
I haven't sensed
any other prisoners.

229
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:25,498
I assume we'll
save them immediately?

230
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,126
Of course.

231
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:30,628
But all these guards
are gonna pose a problem.

232
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:32,672
What do we do?

233
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:34,090
[RUIJERD]
We kill them.

234
00:15:34,174 --> 00:15:35,675
[RUDEUS]
All of them?

235
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,386
[RUIJERD]
They beat and murder children.

236
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:42,849
[SMUGGLER 13F]
What're you two yappin' about?

237
00:15:42,932 --> 00:15:45,518
Take yer freak
and roll out already.

238
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:47,395
[RUDEUS]
Come on, think.

239
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,314
I'd prefer to
settle this peacefully.

240
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:51,066
But with security like this,

241
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:53,777
there's no way
we'll avoid a fight.

242
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,154
Problem is,
he can't kill anyone,

243
00:15:56,237 --> 00:15:58,448
he has the Superd's
reputation to rebuild.

244
00:15:58,531 --> 00:15:59,991
So I have to do it.

245
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:01,826
And really, what's stopping me?

246
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,703
They killed someone first!

247
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:06,581
Yeah, an eye for an eye.

248
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:07,457

[RUIJERD] Relax. You don't
have to get your hands dirty.

251
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:15,590
[gasps] No, we're
in this together.

252
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,426
[RUIJERD] Those hands
are for protecting Eris.

253
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,304
Let me handle this. Okay?

Ha! Look at that.

257
00:16:47,747 --> 00:16:51,626
Don't know why, but I didn't
expect you to be a real Superd.

It's okay, I'm here to help.

don't get upset,

you out of here--

See, I'm not gonna hurt you.

264

It's just me.
Don't worry. It's over.

Nice timing, I just finished
healing their injuries.

270

help the one who died.

beast people, right?

00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:44,197
[RUIJERD] Yes. Those fiends
must have kidnapped them

275
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,199
from the surrounding tribes.

276
00:18:46,282 --> 00:18:47,909

"Meow"? She meowed!

00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:24,571
Not like Eris's
fake-ass imitation,

280
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:26,156
a real, genuine "meow"!

281
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:45,592
[RUDEUS]
Will you get them back to town

282
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:47,218
while I look for the dog?

283

Naturally. Tread carefully,
and we'll see you there.
