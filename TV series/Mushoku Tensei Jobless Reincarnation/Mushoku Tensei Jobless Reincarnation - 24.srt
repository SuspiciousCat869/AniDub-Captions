I want that goblin-slaying

16
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,766
Yes! Exterminating goblins pays

00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,310
one Millis bronze
piece per head.

18
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,478

the left ear of each
goblin as proof,

I said a good reason.

would form a party with me!

Not a chance.

at least allow me

to support you from the rear.

70
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,121
I'm quite often described as
a budding sage, you know.

I promise I'll be helpful!

72
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,501
You being a better mage
than Ruedeus is unlikely.

You may be well-traveled,

but I highly doubt you've ever
seen a mage of my caliber.

I may not look it,

very much about magic, then.

Let me assist.

98
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:28,193
Magic is divided into ranks from
Elementary to Emperor.

99
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,653
With reasonable diligence,
any decent mage

100
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,531
can master Intermediate-level
spells. However!

101
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,868
The spell I just cast
is an Advanced-level.

102
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,788
And most adults can't even
handle an Exodus Flame.

103

That's right!

104

Only a fraction of
all mages have ever

105

mastered Advanced spellcasting!

106
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,710
So I ask again.

107
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,171
Now do you realize
how amazing I a--

Okay, I've seen enough.

You're not gonna be much help,
so you can leave now.

110
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,099
You should really reconsider.

kill a handful of goblins!

out here alone!

Hey, what was that for?

114
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,573
Whatever, forget it,
let this divine power

be rich and nourishing,

You're obviously very strong.

[CLIFF] Hm. How about we head
into the forest for a while?

I can't demonstrate my true
worth fighting mere goblins.

not scared. Are you?

into the air for a second

and see which way the city is.

Don't be ridiculous.
I can't do something like that.

Let's try to find them. Eris?

149

fighting over here.

I can sense their presence.

from your teacher?

[ERIS]
I did!

a truly incredible person.

[gasps] Eris, that's the armor
of the Temple Knights!

162
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,101
[THERESE]
You fools!

163
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,520
Surely you know who
this young lady is!

164
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,564
[ASSASSIN 24A]
Of course.

165
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,649
[THERESE]
Then why seek to harm her?

166
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,611
[ASSASSIN 24A]
Is it not obvious?

167
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,614
[THERESE]
I see. You serve the pope!

168
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,913
[gasps] Hey, please don't
do anything crazy.

169
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,957
We can't get mixed up in this!

170
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,960
That's the Blessed Child being
used to challenge the papacy.

171
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,379
Which means those men
in black attacking her

172
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,299
are the current pope's
personal assassins!

173
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,633
They're ruthless.

174
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,011
Not even I would stand
a chance against them!

175
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,721
I just hope they don't see us.

176
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,805
So stay quiet.

177
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,766
[ERIS]
Too late. They already have.

178
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,017
[CLIFF]
Huh?

179
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,644
[inhales, exhales]

180
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,942
[ERIS] I want you to
stay here and stay hidden.

181
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,444
Eris!

182
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,114
Too slow!

183
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,380
[ASSASSIN 24C groans]

184
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,591
[ASSASSIN 24D grunts]

185
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,676
[THERESE]
Watch yourself!

186
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,970
Their daggers are
dipped in poison!

187
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,395
[ASSASSIN 24D groans]

188
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,153
[ASSASSIN 24E]
You go on ahead.

189
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,117
[gasps]

190
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,328
[ASSASSIN 24E yells]

191
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,844
[ASSASSIN 24E groans]

192
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,949
One got away.
Sorry I couldn't get 'im.

193
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,827
[THERESE] My sincerest thanks
for your assistance.

194
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,455
[ERIS]
I'm just glad the child is safe.

195
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,333
My name is Therese Latria.

196
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,878
I'm a member of
the Temple Knights.

197
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,004
May I ask your name?

198
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,298
Are you an adventurer
from the local guild?

199
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,049
Yeah, I'm Eri--

200
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,430
I'm Ruijerd of
the party Dead End!

201
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,892
Believe it or not,
I'm actually a Superd!

202
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,477
A Superd?

203
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,731
[ERIS]
Hm?

204
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,358
[gasps] Are you really?

205
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,110
Very well, I understand.

206
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,363
Oh. And come to think of it,
I'm also pretty lost.

207
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,573
As thanks for saving you,

208
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,992
can you show me
the way back to town?

209
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,161
Of course! What manner
of knight would I be

210
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:38,289
if I declined to escort
our brave rescuer?

211
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,124
[THERESE whistles]

212
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,673
All right. Shall we be off?

213
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,058
[CLIFF]
Wait for me! I'm here, too!

214
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,186
[ERIS]
What are you wearing that for?

215
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,521
[CLIFF]
This old thing?

216
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,106
Uh. Please pay it no mind.

217
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,817
If you say so. Come on.

218
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,152
[CLIFF]
Right!

219
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,784
[ASSASSIN 24E]
Master Cliff...

220
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,996
What are you doing
with a Temple Knight?

221
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,122
[RUIJERD]
Tell me something.

222
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,375
Why did you target a child?

223
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,293
Who's asking?

224
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,840
Ruijerd of the party Dead End.

225
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,592
I've heard of you.

226
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,470
What would possess you
to side with their faction?

227
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,723
They want to drive
all demons out of Millis.

228
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,725
I'm not with them.

229
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,520
I see. You should join us.

230
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:48,317
The reigning pope wishes for us
all to coexist with demonkind.

231
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,549
[BLESSED CHILD 24A]
Thank you, Miss! Goodbye!

232
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,176
Be careful on
your way home, okay?

233
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,974
Welp. That was fun,

234
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,310
but I guess this is
where we part ways.

235
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,271
[CLIFF]
Miss Eris.

236
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,858
[CLIFF]
Will you marry me?

237
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,487
Absolutely not!

238
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,780
Huh?

239
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,577
You've gotta be kidding me!

240
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,538
How can you refuse someone
so profoundly talented?

241
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,958
Don't tell me that you and--
and that teacher of yours are...

242
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,504
What sort of person is
this man Rudeus, anyway?

243
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,548
Rudeus is amazing!

244
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,259
He can cast spells
without saying anything!

245
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,969
Silent casting?

246
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,930
Hmph. That's impossible,
no one can do that.

247
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,015
And even if he could,

248
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,809
it would surely stunt
his mastery of the craft!

249
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,562
[ERIS] He knows more
spells than you do!

250
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,398
[ERIS]
Rudeus became a Saint-class

251
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,733
water mage when he was five,

252
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,401
and he did it all
with wordless magic!

253
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,403
He's smaller than me,
but he beat a North Saint

254
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,613
on his own the other day!

255
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,239
Well, I only heard
about that later.

256
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,491
I didn't actually see him do it.

257
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,743
But I'm sure he took him
out in no time flat!

258
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,329
I mean, he is Rudeus after all.

259
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:27,166
[CLIFF] Whatever. I could
prob'ly do that, too.

260
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,128
[CLIFF gasps]

261
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,300
[inaudible]

262
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,661
[CLIFF]
I should head home.

263
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,790
[ERIS]
Okay. Bye.

264
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,093
[gasps] Hey, Ruijerd!

265
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,970
What have you been
doin' all day?

266
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,346
I had an errand to run.

267
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,556
That's cool!

268
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,015
You wanna know what I did?

269
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,684
I went out to slay
some goblins, right,

270
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,227
and I met this lady
in the forest

271
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,770
trying to protect a little girl!

272
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,439
A bunch of weirdos
had them hemmed in,

273
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,608
but I swooped in to help
and totally saved the day!

274
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,686
[MAID 24A]
Master Cliff!

275
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,272
I'm terribly sorry to be
the bearer of bad news, sir,

276
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,524
but I've just received word.

277
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,694
Four of your esteemed tutors
have fallen in battle.

278
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:22,364
Rumor has it that they fell prey
to a band of wandering demons.

279
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,784
I'm afraid this
will make conflict

280
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,661
with the archbishop's
supporters inevitable.

281
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,217
I'm back, Rudeus!

282
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,301
Get a load of this!

283
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:46,013
After I was done
slaying goblins, I got...

284
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:50,893
[ERIS gasps] Who was it?
Who did this to you?

285
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:51,977
[RUDEUS]
I'm fine.

286
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,438
You're obviously not!

287
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,243
Rudeus, huh.

288
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,619
'Kay.
