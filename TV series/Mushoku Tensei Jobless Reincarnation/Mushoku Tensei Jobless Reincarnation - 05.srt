00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:16,475
[RUDEUS sighs]

2
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,102
Uh, Miss Ghislaine?
Did my father tell y‐‐

3
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,022
Just Ghislaine is fine.
You can drop the "Miss."

4
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,023
[RUDEUS]
Oh.

5
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:26,818
[GHISLAINE] Read this.
I can't, so do it out loud.

6
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,535
[RUDEUS]
"To my dear son Rudeus.

7
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:38,038
I'm sure you have no idea
what's going on.

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,042
I'd tell you to ask
that musclebound she‐beast,

9
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:45,087
but her brain mutated into an
extra bicep a long time ago,

10
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,672
so you won't get
a decent answer."

11
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,382
[GHISLAINE]
What was that?

12
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,925
Whoa! Please
sit down, Ghislaine,

13
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,843
that was a stupid
little joke, you know!

14
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,804
[GHISLAINE]
Oh, I see.

15
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,807
"I'll cut to the chase
and at least let you know

16
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,226
where I'm sending you.
You're going to tutor

17
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:01,645
a nine‐year‐old
noblewoman in Roa!"

18
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,732
[RUDEUS] A job! All right,
the old man came through!

19
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,777
But was it necessary
to knock me out first?

20
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,529
"The woman with you
works as her family's

21
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,948
bodyguard and
swordsmanship instructor.

22
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,033
So, in exchange for
continuing your training,

23
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,911
she has requested that
you tutor her as well.

24
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,788
Even though she's
got a bicep‐brain,

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,708
try not to laugh,
I think she's serious."

26
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,668
[GHISLAINE]
That son of a...

27
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,045
[RUDEUS]
"But she is a Sword King!

28
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,005
When it comes to the blade,

29
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,257
I can promise you won't find
a better teacher anywhere.

30
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,094
I've never once managed to
beat her. Except in bed."

31
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,220
[RUDEUS]
Would it have killed you to

32
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,681
leave that part out, Paul?

33
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,727
[RUDEUS] Is there anyone
he hasn't slept with?

34
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,854
[RUDEUS] "For the next five
years, until you turn 12,

35
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,189
you'll live in Roa
teaching reading, writing,

36
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,734
arithmetic, and basic magic.

37
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,111
During that time,
I forbid you to return,

38
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,447
and no writing letters, either."

39
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,490
Wait, what?

40
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,534
[PAUL] I sensed that you
and Sylphiette were becoming

41
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,119
too reliant on each other.

42
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,163
So I made the call
to separate you.

43
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,664
Trust me on this.

44
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,083
[RUDEUS] Damn it, Paul,
you'll pay for this.

45
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,753
[PAUL] You'll work and live
independently from now on.

46
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,631
Don't forget, this is how
you'll earn your tuition.

47
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,758
I can't wait to see
the man you become.

48
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,511
Your wise, awe‐inspiring
father, Paul.

49
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,765
[RUDEUS] You beat me into
submission. How is that "wise"?

50
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,768
It sounds like Paul loves you
in his own special way.

51
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,356
"P.S. Feel free to make
a move on the young lady

52
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,190
when you get there,

53
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,443
but keep your hands off
the strongwoman. She's mine."

54
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,279
Do me a favor and send that
letter to Zenith, will you?

55
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,781
Can do.

56
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,618
[RUDEUS] I definitely
have my reservations.

57
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,495
But this is fine, right?

58
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,538
Yeah. It'll be great.

59
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,957
I'm worried about
Sylphie being alone,

60
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,125
but it's true that
she should learn

61
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,086
to solve problems on her own.

62
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,421
She won't grow otherwise.

63
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,591
And Paul's right, I can't
depend on her, either.

64
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,635
So this is for the best.

65
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:01,848
[RUDEUS] Still. I'd like to
see her at least once a year.

66
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,115
[RUDEUS]
So many beast people.

67
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,533
Ghislaine's the first I've seen,

68
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,160
but maybe they're not
that rare in this world.

69
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,041
Thank you.

70
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,341
[door opens]

71
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,677
Hi.

72
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,889
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Rudeus Greyrat.

73
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,224
In a proper noble greeting,

74
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,101
you should draw back
your left foot,

75
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,646
make a circle with your right
hand, and bow just slightly.

76
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,608
Kinda like that?

77
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,402
[PHILIP]
Yes, that's not bad.

78
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,404
Please, sit.

79
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,866
To business, then, my name
is Philip Boreas Greyrat.

80
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,743
The mayor of Roa.

81
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,287
And I'm also your
father's cousin.

82
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,330
[RUDEUS]
Huh? You gotta be kidding me.

83
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,958
So does that mean that
you and I are related?

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,460
[PHILIP]
Indeed, yes.

85
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,546
[RUDEUS]
Ooh. Paul, you scoundrel.

86
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,965
Pulling strings with
estranged family, huh?

87
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,592
This is impressive.

88
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,178
I never knew the Greyrats
were so high‐status.

89
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,139
[PHILIP]
So? How much did he tell you?

90
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,183
[RUDEUS] He said that if
I educate a young lady here

91
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,852
for five years, you'll help
pay for my enrollment

92
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,146
in the University of Magic.

93
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,230
Is that all?

94
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,024
‐‐[RUDEUS] Yes.
‐‐Good grief.

95
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,110
Okay, then. I see
he hasn't changed.

96
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,614
No matter. Come, I'll introduce
you to my daughter.

97
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,199
Then we'll talk.

98
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,617
'Kay.

99
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,415
[PHILIP] I hear you're
quite a skilled mage already.

100
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,375
My master deserves
all the credit.

101
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,836
You also have
your father's charm.

102
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,631
I hope you don't use that
to seduce my little girl.

103
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,925
You know I'm only seven, right?

104
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,052
[PHILIP]
In case Paul failed to mention,

105
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,513
my daughter is
a little "willful."

106
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,349
She only takes to
a select few people.

107
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,893
So I don't expect much from you.

108
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,270
But I'll try you out because
your father asked me.

109
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,689
Well that was
awfully frank of you.

110
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,107
[PHILIP]
Think you can handle this?

111
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,693
[RUDEUS] I won't know
until I meet her, but...

112
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,363
[knocking]

113
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:25,242
Eris. I'd like to introduce you
to your new tutor.

114
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,164
[RUDEUS]
"Intense."

115
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,375
That's my first impression.

116
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,545
My instincts are telling me
to get out, fast.

117
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,929
I'm Rudeus Greyrat.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

118
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,933
What is a little kid
supposed to teach me?

119
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,561
I don't believe that
my age is relevant here.

120
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,855
You don't get to
disagree with me!

121
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,981
What I mean to say, Miss,

122
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,941
is there are some things
I can do that you can't‐‐

123
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,776
[slap]

124
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,821
You're cheeky!
Do you even know who I am?

125
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,823
[RUDEUS] My second
impression is "violent."

126
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,449
Why did you hit me like that?

127
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,286
[ERIS] You're talking back,
even though I'm older!

128
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,046
Now do you understand what it
feels like to be hit for n‐‐

129
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,764
[coughs]

130
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,266
[RUDEUS]
Oh, come on.

131
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,728
I'll teach you to never
raise your hand to me again!

132
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,231
[RUDEUS]
W‐Wait! Please!

133
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,445
[ERIS gasps]

134
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,489
[RUDEUS] Damn it, Paul.
Are you trying to get me killed?

135
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,284
Get back here, scum,
I'm going to pulverize you!

136
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,746
[RUDEUS] "A little willful"?
Don't be ridiculous.

137
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,540
She's no flowery
little noble girl.

138
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,501
She's the protagonist
of a delinquent manga!

139
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,214
[sighs]

140
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,592
[PHILIP laughs]
Well, how did it go?

141
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,595
I've never seen such a vicious
creature in all my life‐‐

142
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:09,512
[PHILIP]
Hm?

143
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,431
Rather, I've never had
the honor of meeting

144
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,267
such a fiery and
passionate young lady.

145
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:20,106
I imagine you'll now
give up and go home?

146
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,735
[RUDEUS] I refuse. To slink back
now would be humiliating.

147
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,279
I won't let my father
look down on me for this.

148
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,823
Oh, how admirable of you.

149
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,116
All of our previous tutors

150
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,369
had admitted defeat
around this point.

151
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,996
So. What's your plan?

152
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,665
I'm not sure yet.

153
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,668
[RUDEUS]
Should I beat her up with magic?

154
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,461
No, that's no good.

155
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,798
Beating her in a fight
won't make her listen.

156
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,635
She's already proven she
would pay me back ten‐fold!

157
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,304
She'd destroy me,
and I can't use healing magic

158
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,390
without incantations yet.

159
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,600
I think I might have an idea.

160
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,227
We could put on a little
show to trick her

161
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,229
into studying of
her own free will.

162
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,942
Oho. That's fascinating.
I'll be happy to help.

163
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,610
[RUDEUS]
All right.

164
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,363
In that case,
here's what I need you to do.

165
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,991
Goodnight, sir.

166
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,707
[RUDEUS sighs]

167
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,587
[RUDEUS] The plan is set.
We'll see what happens.

168
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,966
[RUDEUS]
I thought after I died

169
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,301
I would be done with
beatings like that.

170
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,429
I have to succeed.

171
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,350
[RUDEUS] Ah. I left
the holy relic back home.

172
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,315
Dear Lord. Please.

173
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,776
I really need this to work.

174
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,836
[RUDEUS]
They didn't have to be so rough.

175
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,173
[RUDEUS] I kinda figured
we would wind up

176
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,468
somewhere cleaner, but oh well.

177
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,721
A little atmosphere
never hurt anybody.

178
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,182
Now we'll use my power,
wisdom, and courage

179
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,808
to make a daring escape.

180
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,685
I'll win her respect
and try forcing her

181
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,604
to see the importance
of education.

182
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,107
[RUDEUS laughing]

183
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,777
I see you're finally
awake, My Lady.

184
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,363
What the hell is this?

185
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,782
It appears we've been kidnapped

186
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,867
and are now being
held captive somewhere.

187
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,285
It's a shame you
can't use magic,

188
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,329
otherwise you'd be able to
burn through those ropes

189
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,455
and we could escape.

190
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,415
[ERIS]
Don't talk nonsense!

191
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,834
Ghislaine! Ghislaine,
where are you?

192
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,337
[RUDEUS]
Perfect reaction. Now...

193
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,755
[KIDNAPPER 05A]
Shut up!

194
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,092
[RUDEUS]
Ooh! Nice choice!

195
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,552
Now she'll never guess
this was staged!

196
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,180
I don't know who you think
you are, but you're dead!

197
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,515
[KIDNAPPER 05A]
What'd you say?

198
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,225
[RUDEUS]
This guy's a natural.

199
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,852
[gasps] You stink,
stay away from me!

200
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,230
Any minute now, Ghislaine will‐‐

201
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,321
Looks like you don't
know your place!

202
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,576
Mouthy brats like you
don't get to hit back.

203
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,163
[RUDEUS] Whoa, might wanna
reign that in a little.

204
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,719
[KIDNAPPER 05A]
Creepy little shit.

205
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,599
[sighs]

206
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:47,313
[ERIS whimpering]

207
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,941
You won't get away with this.

208
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,485
I'll tell Grandfather.

209
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,451
Shh.

210
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,372
[RUDEUS] Let this divine power
be rich and nourishing,

211
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,207
offering those whose
strength has been lost

212
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,084
the strength to rise again.

213
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,460
Healing.

214
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,924
What are you doing?

215
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,593
Just heal me all the way.

216
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,887
[RUDEUS] Not if you're gonna
start yelling again.

217
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,763
Use your own magic.

218
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,683
I can't cast anything.
I don't know how.

219
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,935
I bet you could do it
if you'd studied.

220
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,480
[KIDNAPPER 05B]
Did they shut up yet?

221
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,356
[KIDNAPPER 05A]
Yeah.

222
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,108
Well you didn't
kill 'em, did you?

223
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,235
We gotta keep 'em in one piece.

224
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,653
They're still breathing for now,

225
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,489
but we can make do with
the boy by himself, can't we?

226
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,784
[RUDEUS] Uh, no? I hope
they're just good actors,

227
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,996
'cause they're making
me really nervous.

228
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,916
I could go ahead and
blast them with magic.

229
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,292
But that's risky
when I don't know

230
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,628
how strong they are. Besides.

231
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,254
I don't want to
show the young lady here

232
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,506
that violence is the answer.

233
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,219
Reinforcing that idea is
the worst play I can make.

234
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,264
But either way, escaping was
always part of the plan.

235
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:09,270
Sorry, but I don't want to
die here, so I'm leaving. Bye.

236
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,356
Hang on! What about me?

237
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:16,861
[KIDNAPPER 05A] I told you to
shut up! Hey, it won't open!

238
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,029
See ya.

239
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,000
[gasps] Hey, don't leave yet.

240
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,418
You could always
try to beat them up

241
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,671
like you did with me yesterday.

242
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,843
You can come.

243
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,554
If you promise not to
yell or hit me.

244
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,809
Whatever, just get
me out of here.

245
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,602
[RUDEUS]
Do you promise?

246
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,945
‐‐Damn it!
‐‐I got this.

247
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,492
[KIDNAPPERS gasp]

248
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,876
To the body: X‐Healing.

249
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,970
Okay! We're safe now,
so take me home!

250
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,889
You just said you wouldn't
do that anymore, remember?

251
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,766
I shouldn't have to
keep a stupid promise

252
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,393
to someone like you!

253
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,562
[RUDEUS]
Argh, she's a nightmare.

254
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,565
If that's how you feel about it,
then this is where we part.

255
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,066
Good luck.

256
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,693
[ERIS]
Hmph.

257
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,904
[KIDNAPPER 05A] Where'd you go?
Get out here, you little shits!

258
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,825
[ERIS]
I‐I was only kidding around.

259
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,493
I won't shout anymore.

260
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,953
You already lied to me once,

261
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,747
so how am I
supposed to trust you?

262
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,957
Uh, because I mean it this time.

263
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,293
As long as you're willing
to do exactly what I say,

264
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,711
you can come.

265
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,717
[RUDEUS] Looks like we're
still pretty close to Roa.

266
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,093
[ERIS]
I can't read that.

267
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,305
[RUDEUS] Reading comes in handy.
This has the coach fares, too.

268
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,473
So if you knew math,

269
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,558
you could prob'ly
get back on your own.

270
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,186
Why should I have to
when you can do it for me?

271
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,105
With all due respect, I'm not
your servant or anything.

272
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,107
I thought you were my new tutor.

273
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,150
I'm actually not.

274
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,068
[ERIS gasps]

275
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,611
[RUDEUS] You said you
didn't like me, My Lady,

276
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,613
so they didn't hire me.

277
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,809
[BOTH gasp]

278
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,025
[BOTH sigh]

279
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,583
[RUDEUS] We've made it
back to Roa, My Lady.

280
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,419
We should be safe now.

281
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,379
Yes. I guess so.

282
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,048
[RUDEUS] All that adrenaline's
petered out, huh?

283
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,883
That plan went
off the rails a little,

284
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,052
but we're both still here.

285
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,763
If nothing else, at least
she respects me more.

286
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,306
Or she should.

287
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,353
Hey, you work at the manor!

288
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,030
Hold it!

289
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,588
[KIDNAPPER 05A]
What do you want, turd?

290
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,798
Keep your nose out of this
and you can go home.

291
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,009
Let go of me at once‐‐

292
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,223
I would ask that you please
return the girl to me.

293
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,184
[THOMAS]
No can do.

294
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,978
I'm afraid we have to
send Lady Eris away,

295
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,689
but it will make us
all very rich.

296
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,691
[ERIS gasps]

297
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,652
[KIDNAPPER 05B] But hey, we
could use that magic of yours.

298
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,697
If you wanna help us out,
we'll give you a cut.

299
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,242
And exactly how much
would that be?

300
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,162
How does a hundred gold
coins sound to ya?

301
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,041
I dunno. Would that
pay for two enrollments

302
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,376
at the University of Magic?

303
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,505
[laughs] No question.

304
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,841
It could pay for ten with
plenty of gold left over.

305
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,968
Well, in that case.

306
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,262
It is a tempting offer.

307
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,557
[THOMAS] That little girl
has gone out of her way

308
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,893
to make my life a living hell.

309
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,897
If you become her tutor,
she'll do the same to you.

310
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:03,981
Even at your age,

311
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,692
you gotta know this is
one hell of a deal.

312
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,904
If you do, raise that
hand nice and slow.

313
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,448
I do. But I also understand

314
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,076
that some things are
far more valuable than money.

315
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,911
[KIDNAPPER 05B]
Cut the shit, kid!

316
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,622
These aren't just pretty words.

317
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,582
[RUDEUS]
It's weird, but true.

318
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:25,002
This is the first time I've ever
had to worry about money at all.

319
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,296
I spent half my
old life engrossed in

320
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,633
erotic visual novels and MMOs.

321
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,010
And experiencing
those stories taught me

322
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,013
what betraying this
young lady would mean,

323
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,267
and what saving her now
could lead to. Because...

324
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,185
[RUDEUS]
Money can't buy waifus!

325
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,186
Huh?

326
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,273
[RUDEUS] Did not mean
to say that out loud.

327
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,487
[THOMAS]
What the hell?

328
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,822
[KIDNAPPER 05A]
Shit!

329
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,749
[RUDEUS grunts]

330
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,586
[KIDNAPPER 05B]
Damn it!

331
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,254
That does it!

332
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,757
[KIDNAPPER 05A screams]

333
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,801
[RUDEUS]
Sorry, Lady!

334
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,514
Oh, come on.

335
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,520
Tricky little‐‐

336
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,982
[RUDEUS]
Yes! I win.

337
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,319
You're not getting away!

338
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,531
[RUDEUS]
This isn't desperation.

339
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,158
Paul taught me.

340
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,578
The North God Style has
sword‐throwing techniques!

341
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,489
It's Ghislaine! You found me!

342
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,621
[GHISLAINE]
Hey, Rudeus.

343
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,498
Rudeus.

344
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,041
Rudeus!

345
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,960
Were there only two of them?

346
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,463
There were three.

347
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,632
Thank you for coming for us.

348
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,259
[GHISLAINE] I wanted to see
what that explosion was.

349
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,595
Glad I did.

350
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,847
What in the hell
happened to you?

351
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,934
I heard you two went out, but...

352
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,269
No. Not Ghislaine.

353
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,959
[ERIS sighs]

354
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,420
Eris, dear!

355
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:16,215
You've come back
awfully late. [gasps]

356
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,717
What happened?

357
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,598
Lord Philip, this is
a misunderstanding!

358
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,184
It's not what it looks like!

359
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,439
I very much doubt.
Take him away.

360
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,691
Lord Philip, please forgive me!

361
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,861
You can't do this!
Lord Philip, please!

362
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,196
Are you hurt? Come on, let's‐‐

363
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,331
I only promised to wait
until we made it back home.

364
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,500
So I can talk now, right?

365
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:55,045
Of course. Yes,
it's fine now, My Lady.

366
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,718
[RUDEUS]
I guess I failed.

367
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,428
Well, that's what I get.

368
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,848
I was in over my head
and needed rescuing myself.

369
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,309
I wouldn't respect me, either.

370
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,394
I almost died.

371
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,689
Without Ghislaine,
I'd be gone for sure.

372
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:16,233
And I haven't even considered

373
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:20,362
what's going to happen
to me if I die again...

374
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,123
[ERIS]
Hold it!

375
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,668
I've decided I'll give you
special permission

376
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,670
to call me "Eris"!

377
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,506
So you should feel
quite honored!

378
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:44,428
Huh? You're saying it's
okay for me to stay here?

379
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,931
Are you gonna let me
be your tutor?

380
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:52,353
[gasps] I really do
appreciate that, Lady Eris.

381
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,689
It's just "Eris"!
Drop the "Lady"!

382
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,238
[RUDEUS] I wonder if I
earned some affection points

383
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,281
with her after all.

384
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,118
Or if she plans to exact her
revenge when I least expect it.

385
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,871
[RUDEUS]
Eh, time will tell.

386
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,332
But for now, it might be
nice to celebrate

387
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,918
landing my first ever job.
