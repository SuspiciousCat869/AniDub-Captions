1
00:00:24,514 --> 00:00:27,684
[RUDEUS] Bad things
always happen suddenly.

2
00:00:27,726 --> 00:00:29,644
You suddenly lose your parents.

3
00:00:29,686 --> 00:00:33,314
Your siblings suddenly beat
the living crap out of you.

4
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,402
[RUDEUS]
A truck suddenly runs you over.

5
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:41,197
[RUDEUS] You're suddenly
reborn in another world.

6
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:42,741
Your father suddenly
attacks you and

7
00:00:42,782 --> 00:00:45,535
ships you off to tutor
a young noblewoman.

8
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:48,496
You're suddenly teleported
to another continent.

9
00:00:48,538 --> 00:00:50,790
Or maybe that's just me.

10
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,669
[RUDEUS] But one thing is true
no matter who you are:

11
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:58,214
sometimes, people suddenly die.

12
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:14,606
[ERIS]
Hey! Rudeus!

13
00:01:14,647 --> 00:01:16,483
Hurry up!

14
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:19,361
Yeah, yeah.

15
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:34,668
[RUDEUS pants]

16
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:04,656
[ERIS coughing]

17
00:02:04,698 --> 00:02:06,574
You gotta tell me
what happened next!

18
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:09,285
[roaring]

19
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:15,291
Oh, Look! It's a bunch
of red dragons!

20
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,460
I wanna hunt
one of those someday!

21
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:20,296
[RUDEUS chuckles]

22
00:03:04,341 --> 00:03:05,925
[RUDEUS giggles]

23
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:09,679
[panting]

24
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:11,514
[RUDEUS]
Heads up!

25
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:13,308
Thanks a bunch.

26
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,310
And here's one for you!

27
00:03:15,352 --> 00:03:16,478
[RUIJERD]
Thank you.

28
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:18,605
Listen up.

29
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:20,231
I'm listening.

30
00:03:20,273 --> 00:03:24,652
From this day forward,
you may call yourself a warrior.

31
00:03:24,694 --> 00:03:26,696
Are you saying I...?

32
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:29,741
You're an adult now, Eris.

33
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:32,577
[ERIS gasps]
But! No.

34
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:35,497
I've still never defeated
you in a fair fight!

35
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:36,831
That doesn't matter.

36
00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:38,625
You already possess
strength on par with

37
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:41,002
some of the greatest
warriors of our age.

38
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:43,838
He's right. Congratulations!

39
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,010
Wait. Hey, Rudeus?
This isn't a dream, is it?

40
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:50,637
Ooh! You should pinch me.

41
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:52,514
You're not gonna
punch me, are you?

42
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:54,724
No, dummy, just do it!

43
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:00,689
[ERIS] I didn't say
you could pinch me there!

44
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,608
[RUDEUS] Sorry. But at least
we know you're not dreaming,

45
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,319
'cause I wouldn't be in
this much pain if you were!

46
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:11,991
[gasps] I'm a warrior.

47
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:13,785
But don't let it
go to your head.

48
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:15,161
That also means
I won't treat you

49
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:19,124
as a child any longer.
Understand?

50
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:20,333
[ERIS]
Yes!

51
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:42,897
[ERIS]
Rudeus! Look!

52
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:45,984
[ERIS] We don't need to
take this stupid detour,

53
00:04:46,026 --> 00:04:47,360
we have Ruijerd with us!

54
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:48,695
So, let's cut straight
through the mountains

55
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:50,321
and go fight some dragons!

56
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:52,240
Be reasonable, Eris.

57
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:54,617
Come on, you could
take one, couldn't you?

58
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,870
Are you kidding? There's no way!

59
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:59,456
Red dragons are supposed to
be incredibly strong

60
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:01,750
and they live in flocks!
They swarm!

61
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,960
We can't just waltz
through their territory!

62
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:05,879
Back me up, here, Ruijerd.

63
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,838
[RUIJERD]
He's right.

64
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,423
[ERIS]
Aw, really?

65
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:11,301
[RUIJERD] Yes. Even among
the Seven Great Powers,

66
00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:13,845
there are those who would
likely turn back halfway.

67
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:16,681
[RUDEUS] Wait, are you talking
about the Gods we saw

68
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:20,018
listed on that stela along
Holy Sword Highway?

69
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,603
I would have thought
people as strong as them

70
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:25,065
could easily dispatch
a dragon. Wow.

71
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:26,691
[RUIJERD]
They could slay one.

72
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:28,610
But only the mightiest
champions could ever

73
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:31,738
hope to stand against
an entire flock of them.

74
00:05:33,073 --> 00:05:34,949
That's incredible.

75
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:37,410
So that would be
the Technique God,

76
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:41,581
who's at number one, and the
Dragon God at number two. Right?

77
00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:44,459
I wonder what that kind of
power even looks like.

78
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:53,218
Hey, what's gotten into you two?

79
00:05:56,846 --> 00:05:57,889
[gasps]

80
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:47,313
[NANAHOSHI gasps]

81
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,779
Stay right where you are.

82
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:58,158
Don't move a muscle.
Either of you.

83
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:01,578
[roars]

84
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:02,912
[gasps]

85
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,921
[ORSTED] Is that Ruijerd
Superdia I hear?

86
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:22,515
[ORSTED] And you must be
Eris Boreas Greyrat.

87
00:07:22,557 --> 00:07:26,061
But you, I don't recognize.

88
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:29,439
Who the hell are you two?
And how do you know who I am?

89
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,941
Yeah, explain yourself
this instant!

90
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:36,821
This is a curious place to meet
you, but it's not important.

91
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:37,781
[NANAHOSHI]
It's not?

92
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:42,327
There's nothing I can
do about it now. Excuse us.

93
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:44,454
[RUDEUS]
Please, wait!

94
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:45,997
[BOTH gasp]

95
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,750
[ORSTED]
Who are you?

96
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:52,712
Oh, beg your pardon.
My name is Rudeus Greyrat.

97
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:55,548
[ORSTED]
A Greyrat, you said?

98
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,427
[RUDEUS]
Uh, yes. Um.

99
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:02,514
Would you mind
telling us who you are?

100
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:04,516
My name is Orsted.

101
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:07,268
Nice to meet you, Orsted.

102
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,189
So, uh, how did you come to be
acquainted with my friends?

103
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:13,817
[ORSTED]
I'm not. Not yet.

104
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:16,486
[RUDEUS]
"Yet"? What does that mean?

105
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:18,822
[ORSTED]
You don't need to know that.

106
00:08:18,863 --> 00:08:20,115
Tell me this.

107
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:22,617
Which branch of the Greyrats
are you from?

108
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:24,285
Who are your parents?

109
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:26,871
Zenith and Paul Notos Greyrat.

110
00:08:26,913 --> 00:08:32,711
[ORSTED] Hm. Paul shouldn't have
a son, only two daughters.

111
00:08:32,752 --> 00:08:34,462
[RUDEUS]
Well, that was rude.

112
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:38,717
Paul does indeed have a son,
and he takes after his father.

113
00:08:38,758 --> 00:08:43,138
But, uh, how does this guy
know about my sisters?

114
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:49,769
[RUIJERD]
Stop! Don't come any closer!

115
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,649
[ORSTED]
Boy. I notice you match my gaze.

116
00:08:54,691 --> 00:08:56,985
I'd love to stop
as soon as possible,

117
00:08:57,027 --> 00:08:59,529
that look in your eyes
is terrifying.

118
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,532
Interesting.

119
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:04,492
Now, what exactly did you want?

120
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:07,370
Oh, I just... For some reason,

121
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:08,830
it seemed like you
might know something

122
00:09:08,872 --> 00:09:10,957
about the mana disaster.

123
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,585
I don't.

124
00:09:13,626 --> 00:09:17,630
[RUDEUS] All right, then.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

125
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:18,840
[ORSTED]
I wonder.

126
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:21,676
Are you perhaps familiar
with the name "Man-God"?

127
00:09:21,718 --> 00:09:24,637
[RUDEUS] Oh, I am!
He's appeared in my dreams and--

128
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:35,273
So that's it.

129
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:36,524
[RUIJERD]
Rudeus!

130
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:39,486
[ORSTED] I should have known you
were an apostle of the Man-God.

131
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:41,488
Take Eris and run!

132
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:56,294
[yells]

133
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:18,942
[RUDEUS gasps]

134
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:29,411
[gasps]

135
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:34,040
[ERIS yells]

136
00:10:34,082 --> 00:10:35,417
[gasps]

137
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:44,759
You have great potential,
Eris Boreas Greyrat.

138
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:48,388
You've improved considerably,
but you lack polish.

139
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:06,406
[RUDEUS coughing]

140
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:09,617
[ORSTED] When you die,
give the Man-God a message.

141
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:12,537
Tell them Dragon God Orsted
is about to end this

142
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,456
once and for all.

143
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,134
Let the great protection of fire
converge where thouseekest.

144
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:29,721
I call the bold heat
of a torch, here.

145
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:31,765
And now: Fireball!

146
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:53,495
Cast without incantation?

147
00:11:53,536 --> 00:11:56,790
So, did the Man-God
give you that power?

148
00:11:56,831 --> 00:12:00,585
[RUDEUS coughing]

149
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:04,589
That's quite enough of that.

150
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:06,549
Disturb Magic.

151
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:15,725
Heh. Well aren't you
a crafty one?

152
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:21,481
[coughs]

153
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:49,718
Open Front Wyrmgate.

154
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:03,148
What an incredible
quantity of mana.

155
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:05,525
He may rival Laplace.

156
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,824
[coughs]

157
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:20,623
[ORSTED] Why don't you use
silent magic to heal your lungs?

158
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:29,758
[ORSTED]
No matter. Die.

159
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:45,565
[gasps] H-Hey, Rudeus? Rudeus!

160
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:48,026
[RUDEUS]
This doesn't look good.

161
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:50,070
I don't want to die.

162
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:53,198
I haven't gotten to make good
on my promise with Eris yet.

163
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:54,074
I'm coming, okay?

164
00:13:54,115 --> 00:13:56,201
[RUDEUS]
It's just two years.

165
00:13:56,242 --> 00:13:58,703
I can hold on for
two more years.

166
00:13:58,745 --> 00:14:02,290
Then, I'll be able to
die without regrets.

167
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:03,249
[ERIS]
Rudeus!

168
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:06,002
[RUDEUS]
Yeah. It's one wound.

169
00:14:06,044 --> 00:14:10,215
I can do this.
Let me just gather my mana.

170
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:12,759
I can't die yet...

171
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:18,139
Focus and I'll be fine...

172
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:21,393
[screams]

173
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:23,103
We're leaving, Nanahoshi.

174
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:24,646
[NANAHOSHI]
Ah. Sure.

175
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:29,693
[ERIS] Ruijerd!
Ghislaine! Grandfather!

176
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:31,194
Father! Mother!

177
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:32,904
Anyone!

178
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:36,700
Someone, help! I don't care who!

179
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:40,495
[RUDEUS]
Eris, I'm sorry...

180
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:42,539
[ERIS]
Someone save him!

181
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,167
[NANAHOSHI] Orsted.
I just thought of something.

182
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:47,585
What if he...?

183
00:14:58,722 --> 00:14:59,931
Hey!

184
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:07,063
[MAN-GOD] Welp, that, uh...
That was a shame.

185
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:13,111
"A shame"? I suppose that's
one way to put it.

186
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:16,031
[MAN-GOD chuckles]
You know, you're acting

187
00:15:16,072 --> 00:15:18,616
kinda different today.
Are you okay?

188
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:20,827
Are you not feeling well?

189
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:25,081
Well, I do have this wide,
gaping hole in my chest.

190
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:28,877
Hey, can I ask you
something, God-y?

191
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:30,253
[MAN-GOD]
Shoot.

192
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:31,880
[RUDEUS]
That Orsted guy attacked me

193
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:34,215
the second he found out
I knew you.

194
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:36,718
So, uh... Why is that?

195
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,636
[MAN-GOD]
He's the wicked Dragon God!

196
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:40,138
Despite how good
and virtuous I am,

197
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,098
he holds great
enmity towards me.

198
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,683
"Virtuous," huh?

199
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:47,354
Well, I bet you still find
plenty of ways to make enemies.

200
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:49,105
But wait. If that's the case,

201
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:51,816
why not let me know that I was
about to run into him?

202
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:54,027
A heads up
would've been helpful.

203
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:55,487
Yeah, sorry.

204
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:57,906
Sadly, I can't see
anything to do with him.

205
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:00,241
Not his present, or his future.

206
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:03,620
So, I honestly had no idea
you'd run into him, either!

207
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:06,748
That's kinda weird.
Do you know why?

208
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,876
[MAN-GOD] He's got a curse that
makes me unable to see him.

209
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:13,129
[RUDEUS] Really?
So, curses are real, too?

210
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:14,631
[MAN-GOD]
Yup. There are these weirdos

211
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,007
called "Cursed Children."

212
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:19,219
Like Blessed Children,
but, uh, more unfortunate.

213
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,804
Orsted is one of them.

214
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:23,890
He's got about
four curses total.

215
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:25,350
[RUDEUS]
Hmm.

216
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:27,435
[MAN-GOD] Ooh! You saw
how scared Ruijerd

217
00:16:27,477 --> 00:16:29,437
and Eris were of him, right?

218
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,855
That's the really big one.

219
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:32,440
Every living creature
in this world

220
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:34,693
either hates him or fears him.

221
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:39,239
Well, that sounds
pretty damn unpleasant.

222
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,575
I've been hated,
but on that scale?

223
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:45,537
[RUDEUS]
That's gotta suck.

224
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:52,419
[RUDEUS] Except. I didn't hate
or fear him, so what gives?

225
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,753
[MAN-GOD] I would assume
that's because you

226
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:55,922
came from a whole
different world.

227
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:58,758
[RUDEUS] How would being from
another world make me immune?

228
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,928
I don't know, but it was the
same with Ruijerd, wasn't it?

229
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,640
Yeah. Hang on.
What does that mean?

230
00:17:05,682 --> 00:17:08,476
Are you saying Ruijerd
is a Cursed Child, too?

231
00:17:08,518 --> 00:17:10,854
[MAN-GOD] No, no, that's
the curse of the spears.

232
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:12,605
During the war,
Laplace transferred his

233
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:14,399
curse of fear to his
own fancy weapons,

234
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:16,484
and passed those on
to the Superd tribe.

235
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:18,778
That's right. Well,
that's convenient for him.

236
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,321
So Ruijerd is--

237
00:17:20,363 --> 00:17:22,615
Wait, have you known this
from the beginning?

238
00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:24,325
Did you tell me to help him
already knowing

239
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,453
it wasn't going to do any good?

240
00:17:26,494 --> 00:17:28,997
Oh, no, don't get
the wrong idea!

241
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,459
The curse on the Superd will
gradually fade away with time.

242
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,462
Now, a bit of it does still
remain with Ruijerd himself,

243
00:17:35,503 --> 00:17:37,255
but since he started
shaving his head,

244
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:39,257
the effects have
been greatly reduced.

245
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,342
Why is that?

246
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:43,553
Because Laplace
also had green hair!

247
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,806
Ha... You say that like it's
supposed to make sense.

248
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:49,476
Is that really how
curses work here?

249
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:52,729
[MAN-GOD] Yep! Anyway,
the curse on him is fading

250
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,689
because of his
involvement with you!

251
00:17:54,731 --> 00:17:56,608
The deep-rooted prejudice
against him isn't,

252
00:17:56,649 --> 00:18:00,820
but with enough hard work
he can overcome that, too!

253
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:03,698
So, it wasn't a total
waste after all.

254
00:18:07,744 --> 00:18:10,080
That's good to hear, at least.

255
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:14,376
[RUDEUS] I'm still shocked that
he was taken out so easily.

256
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:16,044
Never thought I'd see the day.

257
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:18,797
[MAN-GOD] Oh yeah,
Ruijerd's no match for Orsted.

258
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:21,132
[RUDEUS] Well, he is one of
the Seven Great Powers.

259
00:18:21,174 --> 00:18:22,926
How could we have beaten him?

260
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:27,305
You couldn't.
The Dragon God is unmatched,

261
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:30,517
even after you factor in all
those curses holding him back.

262
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:32,727
Really? I thought
I remembered that

263
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:35,355
the Dragon God was
only ranked number two.

264
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:36,648
Is he not?

265
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,234
[MAN-GOD] The Technique God
is ranked number one,

266
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:41,945
but Orsted would destroy him
if they went toe to toe.

267
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:43,196
Actually, at his full power,

268
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:45,365
he could probably destroy
this whole world.

269
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:49,536
But, too bad, so sad.
His curses won't let him!

270
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:53,206
Weird, though.

271
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:54,457
You sure know a lot about a guy

272
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:56,543
you "can't see any
past or future for."

273
00:18:56,584 --> 00:19:00,213
[chuckles] Well, you know.

274
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:01,673
Hey, it's whatever.

275
00:19:01,715 --> 00:19:03,216
At this point,
I couldn't care less

276
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:05,218
what you're hiding from me.

277
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,804
I appreciate how much
you care about Ruijerd.

278
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,305
Not to mention, I never would've

279
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:11,975
rescued Lilia and
Aisha without you.

280
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,561
So compared to all that,
what are a few little godly

281
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:16,771
white lies sprinkled
in for flavor?

282
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:19,065
It's not like I'll ever
see you again, anyway.

283
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:20,483
You won't?

284
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:23,611
[RUDEUS]
Nah, or I mean, I assume not.

285
00:19:23,653 --> 00:19:25,447
I'm dead as hell, right?

286
00:19:25,488 --> 00:19:26,573
[MAN-GOD]
I get it!

287
00:19:26,614 --> 00:19:28,950
So that's why you've
given up on everything.

288
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:31,369
Aw, just the opposite
of our first meeting.

289
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:33,455
Yeah, 'cause, that time,
I only thought I was dead

290
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:36,499
and I didn't have any idea
what the heck was going on.

291
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,212
[RUDEUS] This time, well,
that's life, huh?

292
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:42,756
I just got unlucky.

293
00:19:42,797 --> 00:19:45,425
Although, I guess
I shouldn't say that.

294
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,260
Unfinished business aside,

295
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:50,347
how many people get
a second shot at life at all?

296
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,935
[RUDEUS]
Yeah. I am lucky.

297
00:19:57,645 --> 00:20:00,982
Welp, I guess this is
where we say goodbye.

298
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:06,446
You got any idea how I'm
supposed to pass on from here?

299
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,658
[MAN-GOD chuckles]
No, sorry.

300
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,494
But I do have some
good news for you!

301
00:20:12,535 --> 00:20:13,578
[RUDEUS]
Huh?

302
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:17,082
Kid. You're not dead yet.

303
00:20:17,123 --> 00:20:18,041
[RUDEUS]
Wha--?

304
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:26,633
Rudeus! You're awake now?

305
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,347
[RUDEUS retching]

306
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:33,932
[ERIS]
Rudeus!

307
00:20:33,973 --> 00:20:36,559
[RUDEUS coughing]

308
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:40,563
[panting]

309
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,694
Are you okay?

310
00:20:46,653 --> 00:20:49,989
[RUDEUS]
Why am I alive?

311
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:52,075
[ERIS]
Uh, just a minute ago,

312
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:54,577
that girl said something
I couldn't hear

313
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:58,248
and the Orsted guy came back
and cast a healing spell.

314
00:20:58,289 --> 00:20:59,541
What girl?

315
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:02,627
I think he called her Nanahoshi?

316
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:07,298
[RUDEUS] Nanahoshi?
The masked one, right.

317
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,677
Why would he want to heal
somebody he just killed?

318
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,557
[ERIS] He'll be fine.
They said he's just knocked out.

319
00:21:15,598 --> 00:21:17,225
That's good to hear.

320
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:30,155
Why are you so
enthusiastic right now?

321
00:21:31,197 --> 00:21:32,532
[RUDEUS]
I dunno.

322
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:35,785
I just feel like everything
in me is overflowing.

323
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,540
So, you won't mind if
I punch you, then?

324
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,959
[RUDEUS]
Not a bit.

325
00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:01,686
I'm sorry I
made you worry, Eris.

326
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,522
You better be, you dummy.

327
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:10,653
[ERIS]
I'm so glad.

328
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:17,243
You're alive. I'm so glad.
