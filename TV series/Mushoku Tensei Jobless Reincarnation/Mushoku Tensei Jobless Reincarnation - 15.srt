00:00:18,049 --> 00:00:24,597
[ERIS, MINITONA,
TERSENA laughing]

2
00:00:27,308 --> 00:00:30,854
Meow! Oh, you done
it meow, Eris!

3
00:00:32,522 --> 00:00:33,773
[ERIS gasps]

4
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:35,984
[MINITONA]
Wow, Eris have so much muscle!

5
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:40,989
[ERIS laughing]
Hey, watch it! That tickles!

6
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:44,826
[ERIS]
Cut it out!

7
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:49,622
[RUDEUS chuckling]

8
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:54,169
[gasps] Hey, don't interrupt,
this is finally getting good.

9
00:00:54,252 --> 00:00:58,006
[gasps] Leave me alone!
You can watch next time, okay?

10
00:00:58,089 --> 00:00:59,090
[barks]

11
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:06,639
Young Master Rudeus.

12
00:01:06,723 --> 00:01:09,517
Why, may I ask,
are you hiding here?

13
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:12,729
[RUDEUS] Uh, people-watching
is a hobby of mine...?

14
00:01:12,812 --> 00:01:14,773
[GYES]
You smell of sexual arousal.

15
00:01:14,856 --> 00:01:16,900
[RUDEUS]
What? No, that's absurd!

16
00:01:16,983 --> 00:01:18,568
Are you sure that's not
coming from a certain

17
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:21,780
beastfolk-loving redhead
in obvious ecstasy?

18
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:23,448
Yes, I'm positive.

19
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:26,493
I'm grateful for all
you've done to help us,

20
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:28,203
and I obviously
regret locking you

21
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:30,789
in a cell over
a misunderstanding.

22
00:01:30,872 --> 00:01:34,959
However, if you dare lay
a finger on my daughter.

23
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:37,879
[RUDEUS]
Say no more, sir!

24
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,198
How's that?

25
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:36,521
[GEESE]
I thought we were cool.

26
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:56,624
Hey, hold still.

27
00:03:10,513 --> 00:03:11,639
[barks]

28
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:12,891
Two!

29
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:14,267
[LEO barks]

30
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,145
[RUDEUS]
Three, two--

31
00:03:17,228 --> 00:03:18,855
Now listen carefully!

32
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:23,818
My name is Eris Greyrat.
How do you do? Got it?

33
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:29,324
I try now! My name
is Minitona! Hello!

34
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:33,078
Uh, my name is Tersena.

35
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:34,496
Nice to meet you!

36
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:37,248
Nicely done, both of you!

37
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:40,752
[RUDEUS] Eris, teaching someone
a foreign language?

38
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:42,879
She does her teacher proud.

39
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:52,097
Lady Eris, thank you for being
a friend to my daughter.

40
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,140
Has she caused you any trouble?

41
00:03:54,224 --> 00:03:56,726
Not at all!
She's a total sweetheart!

42
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,522
Eris squeeze less!
That hurts, meow!

43
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:03,233
[GYES] That ring bears
the mark of our people.

44
00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:05,610
How did it come to be
in your possession?

45
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:07,779
Oh, this? Ghislaine
gave it to me

46
00:04:07,862 --> 00:04:10,615
as a present on
my tenth birthday!

47
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,242
Ghislaine did?

48
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:14,661
That's right!

49
00:04:14,744 --> 00:04:17,330
She's part of this
tribe, too, isn't she?

50
00:04:17,414 --> 00:04:20,208
Oh! Yeah, that completely
slipped my mind.

51
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,711
Do you happen to know her,
by any chance?

52
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:26,965
She's about this tall and,
honestly, looks just like you.

53
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:39,602
[GYES]
So then she's still alive.

54
00:04:39,686 --> 00:04:41,438
Huh?

55
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:45,066
I assumed she rotted away
in a ditch somewhere long ago.

56
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,068
Wait. What is that
supposed to mean?

57
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:49,362
Did something happen
between you two?

58
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:53,116
[GYES] She fled the village
to become an "adventurer,"

59
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,118
abandoning her
sworn duty to guard

60
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:57,912
the forest and the Sacred Beast.

61
00:04:57,996 --> 00:05:01,291
She's a disgrace
to the Doldia tribe.

62
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:02,917
No, she...

63
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:21,811
[RUDEUS]
Wait!

64
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,148
[ERIS]
Who do you think you are?

65
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:33,615
Ghislaine is
my master, you jerk!

66
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:37,619
So don't you dare
talk about her like that!

67
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:39,579
She's incredible!

68
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:41,247
Who are you to say she's not?

69
00:05:41,331 --> 00:05:42,582
She's taught me a lot,

70
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:44,918
and she's always been there
when I needed help!

71
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:49,506
She can run really fast,
and she's really strong!

72
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:53,802
So you shouldn't--[cries]

73
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:57,013
Ghislaine is my favorite
person in the world.

74
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:05,855
[GYES] Ghislaine is admired?
No, that's simply not possible.

75
00:06:06,773 --> 00:06:08,733
No, she is.

76
00:06:10,193 --> 00:06:14,030
Eris. I think we
oughtta let this one go.

77
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:17,701
Why? I don't want to!

78
00:06:17,784 --> 00:06:20,745
Do you suddenly
hate her or something?

79
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:24,332
Of course not, you know I
like her just as much as you do.

80
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,627
Only, it sounds like
the Ghislaine we know

81
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:30,338
isn't the same one
who left their village.

82
00:06:32,215 --> 00:06:34,968
Has Ghislaine truly become
someone respectable

83
00:06:35,051 --> 00:06:36,845
over all these years?

84
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:40,306
I respect her.
For whatever that's worth.

85
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:05,707
I hope you're okay.

86
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,042
[MINITONA]
Eris.

87
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:13,214
Is okay me want to ask you
about Auntie Ghislaine?

88
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:15,717
[ERIS]
Did you say "Auntie"?

89
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,928
Auntie Ghislaine is
little sister of Dad.

90
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:20,305
[gasps]

91
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:23,808
I see.

92
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:28,688
[ERIS] She was my sword
instructor for a long time.

93
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:31,232
She's tough, and super nice.

94
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:34,110
She always saves me
when I get into trouble.

95
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:38,823
[MINITONA]
Okay. But. Dad always say.

96
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:42,077
"No grow up and be
like Auntie Ghislaine."

97
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:47,165
"Train hard,
with sword, with mind,

98
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:49,709
with heart, and get strong."

99
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:51,836
But me hate sword practice.

100
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,215
Don't like follow rules.
Me like play.

101
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:03,098
If you don't like it,
you shouldn't have to do it.

102
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:06,851
But then Dad get big angry.

103
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:11,564
You and I are
a lot alike, Tona.

104
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:14,526
Tona is alike Eris?

105
00:08:23,952 --> 00:08:25,912
And you know,
there are different ways

106
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:28,206
for you to be strong.

107
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:31,918
But I'll always be grateful
that Ghislaine taught me hers.

108
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,883
Hey, Eris!

109
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,469
Please teach me sword
like Auntie Ghislaine does!

110
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:42,804
Want to learn!

111
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:43,930
Huh?

112
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:55,567
Eris! Say okay!

113
00:09:01,906 --> 00:09:03,908
If you insist!

114
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:05,785
We'll start right now
if you want!

115
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:07,245
I'm gonna drill you
until you see

116
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:09,664
how great Ghislaine really is!

117
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,461
[ERIS] Let me warn you.
I'm a strict teacher!

118
00:09:24,137 --> 00:09:27,849
[ERIS] I told you!
Don't just swing wildly!

119
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,149
[ERIS] See? You're predictable!
Be more careful!

120
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:41,112
[GYES] My daughter has never
been keen to learn the sword.

121
00:09:41,196 --> 00:09:44,115
Yet that young lady
convinced her in no time.

122
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:52,207
[GYES] Tell me. Is it true that
Ghislaine is Lady Eris's master?

123
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:57,170
Yep. She looks up to Sword King
Ghislaine more than anyone.

124
00:09:57,253 --> 00:09:59,047
My sister is a Sword King?

125
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,423
Believe it or not.

126
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:03,385
And I tutored her in
basic magic for a few years.

127
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:06,388
[laughs] Ghislaine
training as a mage?

128
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:09,349
What an amusing joke,
Master Rudeus.

129
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:12,769
You are joking?

130
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:14,688
Nope, that's the truth!

131
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:17,732
And she's learned reading,
writing, and arithmetic as well.

132
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:22,153
[GYES gasps]
I never would have guessed.

133
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:25,031
Goes to show, people can change.

134
00:10:56,104 --> 00:10:58,481
[ERIS] Well done. I'm really
proud of all the progress

135
00:10:58,565 --> 00:11:00,692
you've made over these
last three months!

136
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:02,110
I am, too, meow!

137
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:04,821
And I'll be better than you
in no time, me--

138
00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:07,699
[laughs] Nah, you're still soft.

139
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:10,452
That was mean!
Give it back, meow!

140
00:11:10,535 --> 00:11:13,163
[ERIS] You want it,
you gotta take it from me!

141
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:17,167
[TERSENA] The rainy season
is gonna end soon.

142
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,503
Really? Then we can finally
move on to the next town!

143
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:23,506
I'm so ready to fight
some new monsters!

144
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:28,928
[MINITONA]
Eris, stay here forever meow.

145
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:32,891
Huh?

146
00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:34,392
Wish I could.

147
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:37,604
But my whole family is waiting
for me to come back home.

148
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:51,910
[LEO barks]

149
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:53,578
I don't have a lot
going on right now,

150
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:55,914
so I figured I'd get creative.

151
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:57,040
[LEO barks]

152
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,628
Ugh, you're so cute!
Yes, you are!

153
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:21,731
[RUDEUS] I hear ya, but I'm
pretty sure I'm not aroused.

154
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:22,816
[barks]

155
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:37,122
[RUDEUS]
Eris!

156
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:38,289
What?

157
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:52,595
What's that look?

158
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,098
[RUDEUS] Nothing, I'm just
glad you held back.

159
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:56,975
Duh, of course I did.

160
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,310
Hey, Eris?

161
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:07,313
Don't forget we're gonna hit the
road first thing in the morning.

162
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:12,027
We're making a beeline
from here to Millishion.

163
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:16,865
So once we leave, we won't
be back anytime soon.

164
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:17,824
[thud]

165
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:21,786
[ERIS]
I know. What's your point?

166
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,800
Why don't you and I
go for a walk, O Sacred Beast?

167
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:37,719
Come on! Let's go outside.

168
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:55,278
[ERIS]
What are you doing here?

169
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:05,705
I'm sorry I was selfish!
Forgive me, meow!

170
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:23,098
[ERIS]
I guess I can do that.

171
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:41,157
[ALL laugh]

172
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:04,723
The Doldia tribe owes you
a great debt, Master Ruijerd.

173
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:08,101
With your help, we suffered not
a single casualty this season.

174
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:09,728
You have our thanks.

175
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,271
I hope you'll return.

176
00:17:11,354 --> 00:17:14,858
I shall never tire of hearing
your stories of bygone days.

177
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:16,484
I will.

178
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:20,363
[RUDEUS] Huh? When did
those two get so buddy-buddy?

179
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:21,906
And you, Master Rudeus.

180
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,452
Saving our children took
immeasurable courage and skill.

181
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:27,871
I regret that I can't do more
to show my gratitude,

182
00:17:27,954 --> 00:17:31,166
but rest assured that you are
always welcome in our village.

183
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:32,625
Thank you.

184
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,212
I don't want you to go, Eris!

185
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:38,715
We're gonna miss you.
You'll come back, right?

186
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:43,595
Yeah! I promise I will!
Be strong and don't cry, okay?

187
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,431
Lady Eris.

188
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:49,184
Yeah, what?

189
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:53,021
Indulge me. I would like
to spar before you go.

190
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:54,439
[ERIS]
Huh?

191
00:17:54,522 --> 00:17:55,774
[gasps]

192
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:58,151
[GYES] Please. Show me
what Ghislaine taught you.

193
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:00,945
What a Sword King's
pupil can do.

194
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:04,741
I'd love to!

195
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:28,973
[barks]

196
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:51,579
Aww, really?

197
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:52,956
Huh?

198
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,793
Thank you for your time.
A splendid demonstration.

199
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:59,170
[ERIS] Thanks,
you're not so bad yourself!

200
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:02,090
[RUDEUS]
Wait. It's over already?

201
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:05,677
I hope you return.
You'll always be welcome.

202
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,680
And please,
tell my sister the same.

203
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:14,602
Lookin' forward to
our rematch already.

204
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:21,609
[RUDEUS] Am I the only one who
doesn't get what just happened?

205
00:19:23,987 --> 00:19:26,948
See you later!

206
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,367
[GYES]
Farewell! Safe travels!

207
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:32,454
You have a place here!
Never forget!

208
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:34,664
Thank you for everything!

209
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,311
After we get home,
we have to come right back!

210
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:57,187
Yeah.

211
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,689
[GEESE]
Boss! Wait for me!

212
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,194
Hey, new guy.

213
00:20:04,277 --> 00:20:05,320
Surprised to see you here,

214
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:07,197
I thought they still
had you locked up.

215
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,449
[GEESE] Oh, they did.
I made a break for it.

216
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:11,409
You don't mind if I
hitch a ride, do ya?

217
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:13,745
"The more the merrier,"
and all that.

218
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:15,872
We're going to Millis,
if that's okay.

219
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:17,374
[GEESE]
It's perfect!

220
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:20,669
So. I promise you guys won't
even notice I'm here, boss!

221
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,879
Whaddya say? Sound good?

222
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:38,645
This is such a bizarre road.

223
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:40,063
It's the Holy Sword Highway!

224
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:41,523
Legend has it that Saint Millis,

225
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:43,733
founder of the Holy Country
of Millis, hence the name,

226
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:46,486
split the forest and mountains
with one stroke of his sword,

227
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:48,863
and the resulting blast
not only created this road,

228
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,908
but cut a demon king on the next
continent over right in half.

229
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:53,743
That's the coolest thing
I've ever heard,

230
00:20:53,827 --> 00:20:55,912
I wanna learn how to do
something like that!

231
00:20:55,995 --> 00:20:59,165
[RUDEUS]
He said legend, Eris, not fact.

232
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:02,877
[RUDEUS]
What is that shrine for?

233
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:06,006
Oh, now that would be a monument
to the Seven Great Powers.

234
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:07,799
Think you could
elaborate a little?

235
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:09,259
Well, they're supposed
to be the seven

236
00:21:09,342 --> 00:21:12,095
most powerful warriors
in the entire world.

237
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:15,598
I believe the current order is
the Technique God at number one,

238
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:17,934
then Dragon God,
Battle God, Demon God,

239
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:20,478
the Death God, Sword God,
and the North God.

240
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:22,022
But don't quote me on that.

241
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:23,565
That really takes me back.

242
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:25,066
When I was a much younger man,

243
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,694
I trained specifically to
challenge the Seven Great Powers

244
00:21:27,777 --> 00:21:29,654
in hopes I may be
listed among them.

245
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:33,408
Wow! So even you don't stand
a chance against those guys?

246
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:35,243
[RUIJERD]
I can't say for sure,

247
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:37,537
but as my name isn't
on that monument,

248
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,080
I would assume not.

249
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,373
If they're that tough,

250
00:21:40,457 --> 00:21:42,292
then I gotta track 'em down
and meet 'em all!

251
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,252
[GEESE chuckles]
Good luck with that.

252
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,670
Hate to break it to ya,

253
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:47,964
but no one even knows
if the top four are still alive.

254
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:49,924
I've been adventuring
since before you were born,

255
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,676
and I ain't heard
so much as a whisper

256
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,303
of a Great Power's whereabouts.

257
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:56,306
Which prob'ly means the whole
thing is an old wives' tale.

258
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:59,768
[ERIS] That's not fair!
They should show themselves!

259
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:05,440
[RUDEUS] Nah, I can see
the benefits of laying low.

260
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:08,360
Dangerous folks won't
bother you that way.

261
00:22:08,443 --> 00:22:12,364
And boy, if we ever took on
someone Ruijerd couldn't beat?

262
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:15,116
There's no way
we'd make it out alive.
