1
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,930
Crazy. It's come in already?

2
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,974
Guess I'm growing up
faster than I thought.

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,851
Works for me.

4
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:21,146
[RUDEUS] I didn't like studying
other languages in my old life,

5
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,482
but these are surprisingly fun.

6
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,075
Whoa.

7
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,869
[RUDEUS] Eris has gone from
Intermediate to Advanced

8
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:39,081
in the Sword God style
in two short years.

9
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,542
I'm no match for her anymore.

10
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:49,633
[RUDEUS] That thing get bigger?
Seriously, what is that?

11
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,718
It's weirding me out.

12
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:30,108
[ERIS] Move it! Rudeus will
see us if we don't hurry!

13
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,902
Huh?

14
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,029
[ERIS]
I can't wait to see his face!

15
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,238
I bet he's gonna cry!

16
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,948
I don't know,
Master Rudeus isn't

17
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,575
one to wear his
heart on his sleeve.

18
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,577
But you do think
he'll like it, right?

19
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,496
Yes, of course he will.

20
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,747
He's suffered
so much nuisance...

21
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:44,998
[RUDEUS]
"Suffered"?

22
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,709
I've been pretty confident
about my work here.

23
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,045
But if people are talking
about me behind my back,

24
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,298
I'm more confident that I'll cry
myself to sleep every night.

25
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,841
Then we have to
give him the best

26
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,593
tenth birthday party we can!

27
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,762
[gasps]

28
00:02:58,804 --> 00:02:59,846
[ERIS]
But I still wish he'd been

29
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,182
born into a different family.

30
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,687
[RUDEUS] I recently learned
why the Boreas family

31
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,314
can't be too public about me.

32
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,608
Hello, Master Rudeus,
how are you?

33
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,652
How do you do?

34
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,571
[RUDEUS] I thought it was
due to Paul's reputation,

35
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:20,075
but it's his name:
Paul Notos Greyrat.

36
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,370
Notos is one of the
four main Greyrat houses.

37
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,288
When Paul left,
his brother became

38
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,374
the head of that branch instead.

39
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,084
He's kind of a scumbag himself,

40
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,962
so there's a covert
movement to replace him.

41
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,089
Even if I'm not
the one to do that,

42
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,883
a member of the Notos bloodline
under the Boreas roof

43
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,053
could invite some unfortunate
misunderstandings.

44
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:43,473
So, I can't have a massive
shindig like Eris.

45
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,100
Still, they're going
out of their way

46
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,978
to throw me a small,
private party.

47
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,731
I don't care if
I have one at all,

48
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,901
but Eris would be disappointed
if I'm indifferent about it.

49
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,904
I should practice crying on cue.

50
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,074
[RUDEUS]
That aside.

51
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:05,537
I can't believe I've been
in this world ten years.

52
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,880
Everyone seems anxious today.

53
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,923
I can't say I've noticed.

54
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,258
Hey, tell me how a kid your age

55
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,844
learns three languages
in two years.

56
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,888
I've never seen
anything like that.

57
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,181
Well, I never would
have figured out

58
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,475
Beast‐God if not for you.

59
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,186
Studying is surprisingly
hungry work, huh?

60
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,896
What do you say we
go grab a snack?

61
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,189
[gasps]

62
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,776
We shouldn't do that
right before dinner.

63
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,321
Wh‐Why don't we just
relax in here instead?

64
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:43,742
[RUDEUS] Ah‐ha. Today's
the day, isn't it?

65
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,745
Yeah, we can do that.

66
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,622
In fact, this is
the perfect opportunity

67
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,999
to show you something
I've been working on.

68
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,797
You made a statue of me?

69
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,590
You've gotten
really good at these.

70
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,176
Oh. It's missing
my tail, though.

71
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,720
I don't quite understand
how they work.

72
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,848
[RUDEUS chuckles]
This'll be fun.

73
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,684
Let's see how far
she'll go to keep me here.

74
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,646
But I'd love to learn!
Can I see the base of your tail?

75
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,148
[RUDEUS] How will you get
out of this one, Ghislaine?

76
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,527
Oh, well if that's all you need.
No problem at all.

77
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:22,531
[RUDEUS] Just like that?
Wow. Zero hesitation.

78
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,907
You win this round, lady.

79
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,034
Is it okay if I touch it?

80
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,994
Of course, go right ahead.

81
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:35,335
[RUDEUS] Whoa. Talk about toned.
How is this a real butt?

82
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,338
Oh my God! I want
muscle like this!

83
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,756
[knocking]

84
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,842
Excuse me,
Young Master Rudeus.

85
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,718
Your dinner is served.

86
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:53,854
[ALL] Rudeus! From the Boreas
House, happy tenth birthday!

87
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,899
[laughs]

88
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,611
I... What is this?

89
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:05,615
Here, Rudeus. Happy birthday.

90
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:09,703
Wow. Thank you. I had
forgotten what day it was.

91
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,625
[RUDEUS]
I... I'm sorry.

92
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:20,255
I‐It's just that
I didn't expect...

93
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,090
Ever since I got here,

94
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,843
I've been so worried
I wasn't welcome.

95
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,847
I‐I never thought you would
celebrate me like this.

96
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,515
To arms at once!

97
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,684
I declare war on
the Notos House!

98
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,187
I'll murder Pilemon myself
and put Rudeus in charge!

99
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,858
[PHILIP]
Father! Restrain yourself!

100
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,738
Gather the troops, you fools!
Release me! Release me!

101
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,741
[RUDEUS] I didn't think I was
that good of an actor.

102
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,619
Um. Ignoring all of
that for a moment.

103
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,745
You better get excited,

104
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,747
because I've got
a surprise for you today!

105
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,832
Really? What kind of surprise?

106
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,083
[ERIS]
Take a guess!

107
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,296
[RUDEUS] Hmm. Wait.
Don't tell me my family's here?

108
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:05,800
[gasps] Oh, well, um.
We wrote to invite them,

109
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,677
but I'm afraid the
monsters have been

110
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,972
acting up lately,
so they couldn't make it.

111
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,725
I see. That's a shame.

112
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:19,648
Hey. Listen. I'm sorry,
Rudeus. Are you okay?

113
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,816
[RUDEUS]
Huh? Oh, no.

114
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,027
This isn't the mood
I wanted. Whoa!

115
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,364
[HILDA] It's all right, Rudeus!
We're your family now!

116
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,531
[RUDEUS]
Hold up.

117
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,034
Didn't this woman
hate me two seconds ago?

118
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,328
We'll adopt‐‐ No!

119
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,038
Why don't you
marry Eris instead?

120
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,539
[gasps] Mother, no!

121
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,834
Oh, I'm sorry, is Rudeus not
good enough for you, darling?

122
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,419
Rudeus is only ten!

123
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,171
His age is irrelevant!

124
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,507
And it's time you learned
to be a proper lady!

125
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,384
[HILDA gasps]
What are you doing?

126
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,388
Unhand me this instant,
I must save that poor child!

127
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,682
So, what is it?

128
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,059
The surprise you
were talking about.

129
00:07:56,101 --> 00:08:03,108
R‐Right. Ahem. Now, Alphonse!
Bring it forward!

130
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,901
[ALPHONSE]
For you, sir.

131
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:07,946
A staff?

132
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,282
I do hope you find it
to your liking, Master Rudeus.

133
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,076
We gathered only
the finest materials

134
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,620
from around the world so that
Asura Kingdom's foremost

135
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,457
craftsman could build a staff
befitting a Water Saint.

136
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,003
I present Aqua Heartia.

137
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,508
[RUDEUS] It's not hard to see
that this thing cost a fortune.

138
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,512
It's gorgeous. Even if
its name is kinda lame.

139
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,347
You're a great mage,
so it's weird that

140
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,225
you don't have a staff of
your own already! Take it!

141
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,687
Thank you very much.
This is such an expensive gift.

142
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,772
You don't need to worry
about the price!

143
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,483
Now, let the party begin!

144
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:12,260
Rudeus. Happy birthday.

145
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,893
Eris actually has two brothers,
one older and one younger.

146
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,813
But when they were born,

147
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,149
my brother in the capital
took them both.

148
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,650
He took them?

149
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,945
Boreas men are raised
by the family head.

150
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:35,492
I lost the succession dispute,
so my sons were "adopted."

151
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,204
That's our branch's tradition.

152
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,415
Hilda still refuses to
accept that, of course.

153
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,666
Why would she?

154
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,795
Her children were taken
from her against her will.

155
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,630
That's why she hated you.

156
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,173
Her sons aren't
allowed in her home,

157
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,843
but this outsider can parade
around like he owns the place.

158
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:54,969
You see?

159
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,185
[gasps]

160
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,898
[PHILIP] I hope you don't
hold that against her.

161
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,818
No, that's perfectly
understandable.

162
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,989
That said. If you're
willing to lend a hand,

163
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,742
we could seize control
of the household.

164
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,828
[RUDEUS laughs]
What kind of political sway

165
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,329
does a ten‐year‐old have?

166
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,832
Marry Eris and lay low for now.

167
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,500
I'll handle the coup.

168
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,169
If it helps seal the deal,
I'll throw her in your bed

169
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,421
with her hands tied tonight.

170
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,136
[RUDEUS] Hang on,
does he want to put me

171
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,888
in charge of the family?
That's insane.

172
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,558
I want no part of
this power struggle.

173
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,645
I'll pretend you only said all
that because you're drunk.

174
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,398
Is that so? If you insist.

175
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,817
[RUDEUS]
Well. I should turn in.

176
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,569
[PHILIP]
Yes. Goodnight.

177
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,820
[RUDEUS]
Goodnight, sir.

178
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,498
[BEAST MAID 08B] Goodnight,
Master Rudeus. Sleep well.

179
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,418
Thanks, goodnight. [gasps]

180
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,753
[RUDEUS]
If I had taken Philip's deal,

181
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,549
I could have created my own
personal beast maid harem!

182
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,760
No! What a wasted opportunity!

183
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,556
[ERIS]
W‐Welcome back.

184
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,099
Good evening.

185
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,482
What are you doing here?
Are you okay?

186
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,943
I... I was afraid
you'd get lonely,

187
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,820
so I decided to
sleep here for tonight.

188
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,573
[RUDEUS]
Philip put her up to this.

189
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:42,410
But, it is nice to
see her this way.

190
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:57,175
[gasps] Rudeus?

191
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,428
[RUDEUS] How can I resist
the opportunity to share

192
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,765
my first time with
a stuck‐up, spoiled tsundere?

193
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,434
S‐Stop.

194
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,268
[gasps]

195
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,436
[RUDEUS]
No, I can't touch her,

196
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,521
that's exactly
what Philip wants!

197
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,398
Maybe I can scare her off?

198
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,276
Now that you mention it,
I am kinda lonely.

199
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:18,279
But I might try something
dirty if you stay here.

200
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:22,200
Fine, then. You can do that.
Just a little, though.

201
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,702
[RUDEUS gasps]

202
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,584
[RUDEUS] Well, how can I
refuse that offer?

203
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,796
Even if I am playing into
Philip's hands, this is my life.

204
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,590
And what's life
without a little risk?

205
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,009
[RUDEUS]
You're trembling.

206
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,387
[ERIS]
That's just your imagination!

207
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,889
[RUDEUS]
Her hair is so smooth.

208
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,934
With as much as she trains,
it's normally messier.

209
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,144
She cleaned it up for me.

210
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,147
You're really cute, Eris.

211
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,608
Huh? Where did that come from?

212
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,822
[RUDEUS]
I'm gonna touch you now.

213
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,295
[RUDEUS] Does that mean she's
giving me the green light?

214
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,462
She is, right?

215
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,463
That was a yes?

216
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,506
I'm good to go?

217
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,843
Well, okay! Let's do this!

218
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,475
[gasps] No!

219
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,481
I said "just a little"!

220
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,858
[RUDEUS]
Careful‐‐!

221
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,652
Rudeus! You idiot!

222
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,247
What the hell is wrong with me?

223
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,958
[RUDEUS]
I completely forgot myself.

224
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,668
What was I thinking?

225
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,254
"I know what girls want.
I've played dating sims."

226
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,757
This is why you died a virgin.

227
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:07,055
[RUDEUS] Everything Eris
did today was for me.

228
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,808
She worked so hard because
she cares about my feelings.

229
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,186
And I just ignored hers.

230
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:17,148
[sighs] I'm the worst.

231
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,319
[gasps] I'm so sorry!

232
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,987
Look. Today's a special day,

233
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,531
so I'll make an exception
and forgive you this time!

234
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,492
[RUDEUS]
No. Is she for real?

235
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,828
But, uh. It's still
too soon for that, so...

236
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,330
Five years! In five years,

237
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,791
we'll both be proper
grown‐ups, and then...

238
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,418
Maybe we can.

239
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,754
So, until then,
control yourself!

240
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,048
[RUDEUS gasps]
Yes, ma'am.

241
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,051
Good. Well, then I'm
gonna go back to bed now.

242
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:48,346
Goodnight. Sweet dreams
and whatever.

243
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,640
And I'll see you
tomorrow for practice!

244
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,189
[RUDEUS sighs]
Thank God.

245
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,692
[RUDEUS]
Thank God it's my birthday.

246
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,070
Thank God today was special.

247
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,240
Thank God I didn't
do anything worse. And...

248
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,908
[RUDEUS]
Aw, yeah!

249
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,245
[RUDEUS] It's settled!
She promised! To me!

250
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,956
Okay. No more
indulgences till then.

251
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,333
Five years. I'll be 15.

252
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,002
It feels like forever,
but... I can wait!

253
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:24,757
After all, a charged attack is
stronger the longer it's held.

254
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,217
Wait, five years?

255
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:31,848
[gasps] Wait! Sylphie!

256
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:41,190
[PAUL] Damn, I thought for sure
we'd found the last of them.

257
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,109
Where are they coming from?

258
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,236
Apparently the increase
in monster activity

259
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,405
isn't unique to our village.

260
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,031
I've heard reports of
the same coming in

261
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,117
from across the entire region.

262
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:55,455
These bastards are keeping me
from my son's tenth birthday.

263
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,875
Sorry, Rudeus.
Hope you can forgive me.

264
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,586
Hi, Zenith!

265
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:06,632
Well, good afternoon, Sylphie!
Come on, love, don't be shy!

266
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,051
Hey there, Norn. How are ya?

267
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,388
[SYLPHIE, ZENITH giggle]

268
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,099
[LILIA] Aisha. Make sure
you wipe the corners, too.

269
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,143
Okay!

270
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,394
Hi, Miss Lilia.

271
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,729
Sylphie, dear! Hello!

272
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,064
[SYLPHIE]
Will you send this off for me?

273
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,900
[LILIA]
What a cute pendant.

274
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,194
[SYLPHIE giggles]
I made it myself

275
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,362
based on one my dad's treasures.

276
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:32,366
You did a lovely job.
I'll make sure this reaches him.

277
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,951
It stinks that
we can't go visit,

278
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,245
but at least we can
still give him gifts.

279
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:40,791
Yes. I'm going to send him this.

280
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,918
What's in it?

281
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,464
Something Master Rudeus used to
keep by his side at all times.

282
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,381
[AISHA]
Big sis!

283
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,091
Aisha!

284
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,426
[AISHA, SYLPHIE]
Yay!

285
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:54,305
Look at you,
you're growing up so fast!

286
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,974
I'm so glad that Sylphie's
finally cheered up.

287
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,809
I couldn't believe
the way she acted out

288
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,020
after Master Rudeus
left for Roa.

289
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,147
I know! I'll need to
have a talk with Rudy

290
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,650
about some of the
things he taught her.

291
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,068
[LILIA] But her parents
said that she stopped

292
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,530
getting bullied shortly
thereafter. So I'm glad.

293
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,991
[ZENITH] Me, too. Even without
a gem in her forehead.

294
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,702
It's easy to mistake
her for a Superd.

295
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,829
What is a Superd, Mama?

296
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,748
You're brave for even asking!

297
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,292
They're the scariest demons
in the entire world.

298
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:28,464
And if you're not good,
they'll eat you for dinner!

299
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,259
[cries]

300
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,595
[ZENITH gasps] Oh, I'm sorry,
sweet girl! Don't cry!

301
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:35,763
Hey, I'm back.

302
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,473
You were gone a long time.

303
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,766
Good to see you home.

304
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,103
Hey, what's the matter?
Aww, c'mere, you.

305
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,604
Monsters again?

306
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,607
Uh‐huh. I don't know
what's gotten into 'em.

307
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,775
They're everywhere now.

308
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,319
[rumbling]

309
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,157
Storm clouds? Or what?

310
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,456
[PAX] Roxy, I don't care
about studying,

311
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,293
just take your clothes off!
Come on. For me?

312
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,586
[ROXY sighs]

313
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,636
[ROXY]
What is that?

314
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:19,432
It's directly above
Asura Kingdom.

315
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:23,227
No way. Rudeus?

316
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,676
[roars]

317
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:28,793
Mana pooling in the west?
What caused this madness?

318
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,841
No matter. I'll see for
myself soon enough.

319
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,472
[KISHIRIKA] Ooh, would you
look at all that juice?

320
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,684
Whose spell is that, We wonder?

321
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,686
Hey, We can't see them!

322
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:50,439
They must be shy.
What a nuisance.

323
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:55,319
[KISHIRIKA] Oh well! Guess we'll
meet them face to face!

324
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,280
Behold the Great Emperor
of the Demon World,

325
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,158
Kishirika Kishirisu!

326
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,204
[KISHIRIKA]
Now, soldiers! Sally forth!

327
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:11,001
[KISHIRIKA cackling]

328
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,092
[PERUGIUS] That light.
It resembles a summoning.

329
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,095
I wonder. Is someone
trying to break the seal

330
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:24,014
on the Demon God Laplace?

331
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,976
Hmph. Almanfi!

332
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,186
[ALMANFI]
Yes, sir.

333
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,064
[PERUGIUS] Investigate the
source of that mana cloud.

334
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,609
If you find the one
responsible. Kill them.

335
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,153
[ALMANFI]
As you wish.

336
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,824
[GHISLAINE] You've brought
us quite a long way.

337
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,033
[ERIS]
Did we come far enough for you

338
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,911
to show us your strongest spell?

339
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,621
Ta‐dah!

340
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,422
[RUDEUS]
Whoa. And I barely used any MP.

341
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:57,757
So. How is it?

342
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,677
It'll take some getting used to,
but it feels incredible.

343
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:05,055
[ERIS gasps]
Really? That's great!

344
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,767
[RUDEUS] Now. The moment
you've all been waiting for.

345
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,478
Water Saint Rudeus Greyrat's
mightiest attack!

346
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,481
Behold, mortals! Cumulonimbus!

347
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,107
[ERIS giggles]

348
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,067
[RUDEUS]
Gather, mana!

349
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,403
O, spirits of the
magnificent waters

350
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,614
and imperial prince
of lightning who‐‐

351
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,865
What the?

352
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,625
[ERIS] That was fast.
Is that the whole spell?

353
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,044
No, I'd barely gotten started.

354
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,798
That's concentrated mana.

355
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,049
How can you tell?

356
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,176
Should we head back to Roa?

357
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:45,721
Yes. The farther away,
the be‐‐ Get down!

358
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,974
What was that?

359
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,165
‐‐Who's he?
‐‐Start talking, now!

360
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,501
[ALMANFI]
I am Almanfi the Radiant.

361
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,711
By order of Lord Perugius,

362
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,214
I have come to put a stop
to this phenomenon.

363
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,507
[RUDEUS]
Perugius?

364
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,093
Rudeus, take Lady Eris
and fall back!

365
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,845
[ALMANFI]
Step aside, woman.

366
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,556
If I slay that mage,
the disturbance may cease.

367
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,392
I am the Sword King
Ghislaine Dedoldia.

368
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,270
He's under my protection,
so withdraw!

369
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,231
[ALMANFI]
You're a Sword King?

370
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,316
I swear on the
name of my master,

371
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:43,070
Sword God Gal Farion,
and the honor of Doldia.

372
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:48,534
[ALMANFI]
Hmph. If what you say is false,

373
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,537
Lord Perugius will
decide your fate.

374
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,039
No remorse for
ambushing children?

375
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,501
[ALMANFI] It's your own fault
for arousing suspicion here.

376
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,128
[RUDEUS]
Okay, calm down.

377
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,172
I can figure this out.
From the top.

378
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,008
First, the sky changed.

379
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,218
Then a weirdo in
a mask showed up.

380
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,930
Saying he was sent by a
centuries‐old legendary hero.

381
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,766
He attacked me because he thinks
the sky thing is my fault.

382
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,102
It's not, but it
sounds like he knows

383
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:19,648
more about it than we do.
Right? In which case...

384
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,151
[ALMANFI gasps]

385
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,238
Wait a second, at least
tell us what's going on‐‐

386
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,872
[gasps]

387
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,001
Lady Eris! Rudeus!

388
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,085
[RUDEUS]
Come on!

389
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,088
Eris!
