[RUDEUS]
Hello there.

2
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:24,264
I'm Rudeus,
a former jobless bum.

3
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:26,516
Today, we're looking
at a hot new apartment

4
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:30,103
that can be yours for
the low, low price of free!

5
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:32,814
No deposit, no fees, no rent!

6
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:34,941
It's a homey,
shabby-chic number

7
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:37,694
made from hardy,
locally sourced wood.

8
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:39,195
For your convenience,
it comes furnished

9
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:43,616
with a rustic straw bed.
Mind the bugs, heh!

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,536
There's an en suite
bathroom as well,

11
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:48,997
you just do your
business in this hole!

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,084
As a modern boy, I'm a little
iffy on how hygienic that is.

13
00:00:53,168 --> 00:00:55,670
But you just can't
beat this price!

14
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:59,174
Nothing's cheaper than free!

15
00:00:59,257 --> 00:01:03,011
And lest I forget, breakfast
and dinner are included!

16
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:05,430
The food here is
nothing to sneeze at.

17
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:07,474
I don't know what kind
of meat this is,

18
00:01:07,557 --> 00:01:10,018
but for anyone who's used to
life on the Demon Continent,

19
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:13,563
its tenderness and flavor
are like no other.

20
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:17,734
[RUDEUS] Now for this
apartment's greatest feature:

21
00:01:17,817 --> 00:01:20,153
its reassuring security.

22
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:22,072
Check out these sturdy beams!

23
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:24,074
I couldn't budge them
if I wanted!

24
00:01:24,157 --> 00:01:25,700
Believe you me,
one look at these

25
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:28,787
would make any
burglar think twice.

26
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,997
And yet, criminals
still manage to

27
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:33,667
find their way
inside constantly.

28
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,922
'Cause after all,
this is a prison.

29
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:18,355
[RUDEUS]
So. Now what am I gonna do?

30
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:23,151
[RUDEUS] It'd be easy enough
to open the lock with magic,

31
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:25,737
but I'm in the middle
of a forest.

32
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,241
Getting lost in a place like
this would not end well.

33
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:31,409
[gasps]

34
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:53,223
[RUDEUS] Guess stripping me
naked wasn't enough.

35
00:03:53,306 --> 00:03:54,724
They have to douse me
in cold water

36
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:57,060
and insult me on top of it!

37
00:03:57,143 --> 00:04:00,188
What'll I do if this
gives me a new fetish?

38
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:03,733
O Goddess,
grant me your protection!

39
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:05,193
[RUDEUS sneezes]

40
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:32,137
[birds squawking]

41
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:10,884
[RUDEUS]
I shouldn't do anything rash.

42
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:13,803
I'll wait for Ruijerd and
Eris to save the day.

43
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:19,809
[RUDEUS]
Although, I wouldn't have to

44
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:22,729
if these people would
just listen to me.

45
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:27,275
[RUDEUS] Put those big ears
to use, why don't ya?

46
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:44,417
[RUDEUS]
Ruijerd's taking his sweet time.

47
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:46,252
What's the deal?

48
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:48,380
I wonder if he got into
it with that older warrior

49
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:51,216
who ran off after him
and the kids.

50
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:54,302
Or if maybe something
happened to Eris?

51
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:56,179
No, they can handle themselves.

52
00:05:56,262 --> 00:05:58,223
No point in catastrophizing.

53
00:05:58,306 --> 00:06:00,600
Besides, it's only day three.

54
00:06:00,684 --> 00:06:03,353
"Good things come
to those who wait."

55
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:20,704
This sucks.

56
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:30,422
[GEESE gasps]
Hey, that hurt!

57
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:31,548
Don't ignore me!

58
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:34,092
Would it kill ya
to be a little gentler?

59
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:35,343
[groans]

60
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:38,346
[GEESE gasps]

61
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,223
Welcome, traveler.

62
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:42,892
I'm afraid you've reached
the end of the line.

63
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:50,483
What's wrong? Flustered?

64
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:54,237
[GEESE] No, you just
struck me as, um, cocky.

65
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,280
Watch it, new guy,

66
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:56,364
I've been in here
longer than you,

67
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:57,699
which means I'm
the master of this cell!

68
00:06:57,782 --> 00:06:59,576
Show some respect!

69
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:01,703
[GEESE]
Uh, 'kay.

70
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:04,205
Good, now please,
make yourself comfortable.

71
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:05,790
Let's chat:
what's a guy like you

72
00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:07,083
doing in a place like this?

73
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,794
Oh. Their guards
caught me cheating, is all.

74
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:11,671
[RUDEUS]
Ooh, a gambling man!

75
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:14,299
Was it rock-paper-scissors?
Crossing steel beams?

76
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:16,301
No, what the hell are those?

77
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:18,470
It was dice.
What about you, boss?

78
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:20,930
I hugged a silver dog
and the next thing I knew,

79
00:07:21,014 --> 00:07:22,265
I was rotting in prison.

80
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:23,850
[GEESE]
Oh, that was you?

81
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:26,436
Everyone's been talking about
how the Doldias' Sacred Beast

82
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,938
got attacked by
a "beast" in heat.

83
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:31,441
[RUDEUS]
These folks got jokes, huh?

84
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:33,193
So what's your name, new guy?

85
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:34,319
It's Geese.

86
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:36,696
[RUDEUS]
Cool. I'm Rudeus.

87
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,369
Huh? Rudeus. I swear I've
heard that name before.

88
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:44,621
I'm sure a lot of people
have this name.

89
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:46,373
[GEESE]
Yeah, you're prob'ly right.

90
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:49,709
Oh. Sorry to change
the subject, but I gotta ask.

91
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:50,835
Before you were arrested,

92
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:52,629
did you happen to see
a redheaded girl

93
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:55,298
or a tall bald guy
out there looking for me?

94
00:07:55,382 --> 00:07:56,925
Nope, Not that I recall.

95
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:58,218
Why, do you owe 'em
money or something--?

96
00:07:58,301 --> 00:08:00,804
No! I was imprisoned here
on false charges!

97
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:03,723
But neither of my companions
have shown up to rescue me!

98
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:08,978
Ah! Yeah, that's gotta suck.
I-I'm sorry to hear that.

99
00:08:09,062 --> 00:08:10,855
[RUDEUS]
Hey, don't give me that tone!

100
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:13,358
It's not like they up and
ditched me or anything!

101
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:15,443
They're probably just
taking extra care

102
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:20,031
to find the kids' parents.
Yeah. That's gotta be it.

103
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:26,329
[RUDEUS]
Ahh, right there.

104
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:29,207
You're pretty good
at this, new guy.

105
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,460
[GEESE chuckles]
I can do just about anything.

106
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:33,586
[RUDEUS]
Oh yeah?

107
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,338
Can you take down
a full-grown dragon

108
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:36,423
with your bare hands?

109
00:08:36,506 --> 00:08:39,217
[GEESE] Well no,
nothing quite like that.

110
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,469
I'm not much of a fighter.

111
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:42,929
A pacifist?

112
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:45,724
Then, can you satisfy
a hundred women at once?

113
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:49,728
[GEESE] Ha, one is enough
for me. Two, tops.

114
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:54,941
[RUDEUS] Hmm. Well, can you
tell me how to get back

115
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:56,568
to Zant Port from here?

116
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:57,819
[GEESE gasps]

117
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:02,907
How come? Gonna make
a break for it?

118
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:05,452
[RUDEUS] I'm getting worried
about my friends.

119
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:09,622
[GEESE] Look. If you wanna run,
you're on your own!

120
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:12,834
Really? You could at least
guide me part of the way!

121
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:15,211
Hey, all I want is to
serve my time, man!

122
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:18,006
If you really are innocent,
why don't you just tell them?

123
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:20,091
Do you honestly think
I haven't tried that already?

124
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:22,427
No one will listen
to a word I say!

125
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,845
Fine! I'll take
the guard hostage

126
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:25,513
and make her
lead me back to town!

127
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:27,932
Wait! Calm down!

128
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:31,019
Get your hands off me, newbie,
I've had it with this place!

129
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:33,730
I'll burn this forest to
the ground if I have to!

130
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:38,526
Huh? Uh, not seeing the guard.

131
00:09:39,736 --> 00:09:42,280
Is it just me,
or is it hot in here?

132
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:43,656
Yeah, now that you mention it,

133
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,325
I guess it is
getting a little warm.

134
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:47,786
And kinda-sorta smoky?

135
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:04,594
That, uh, wasn't you, right?

136
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:08,640
[GEESE]
Then that means...

137
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:10,767
[BOTH]
Wildfire!

138
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,977
We'll get roasted
alive if we don't

139
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:14,604
think fast, boss! What do we do?

140
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:16,356
Duh! We bust outta here, genius!

141
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:18,983
How do we do that with no key?

142
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:20,777
Like this, of course!

143
00:10:23,196 --> 00:10:24,572
I got it, let's roll.

144
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:27,033
Didn't even break a sweat!
That's why you're the boss!

145
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:04,738
[GEESE]
This is horrible.

146
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:06,239
I heard someone
had been kidnapping

147
00:11:06,322 --> 00:11:08,283
and selling beast kids lately.

148
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:11,286
I wonder if these
are the same guys.

149
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:15,874
[RUDEUS] Whatever they want,
they're going way too far.

150
00:11:15,957 --> 00:11:17,584
After almost a week
of languishing

151
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,252
in a cell on trumped-up charges,

152
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:20,628
I've been feeling
a little vindictive

153
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:23,340
towards these villagers.

154
00:11:23,423 --> 00:11:27,052
So I wouldn't mind seeing them
get their just desserts.

155
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,973
[RUDEUS]
But this? This is too much.

156
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:34,517

00:13:58,203 --> 00:14:01,373
But I'm surprised you've
turned coat, Kennel Master.

188
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:03,458
Especially considering
your companions

190
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:08,046
keeping the Doldia warriors
occupied for us.

191
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:11,049
I wondered what was
taking them so long.

192

Hang on, you know this guy?

Yeah. Sorta.

Lest we all forget where
your loyalties oughtta lie.

Without me,
you'd still be stranded

on that hellscape
Demon Continent.

198
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:26,064
[RUDEUS] So this was your
plan from the beginning.

199
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:27,565
[GALLUS]
Now you're gettin' it!

200
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,484
We took the kids
in the first place,

201
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:30,902
we only wanted
you to set them free

202
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:33,113
to draw the warriors'
attention away from here

203
00:14:33,196 --> 00:14:34,572
and out to the docks.

204
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,616
Then your Superd buddy
could kill 'em

205
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,161
and we could charge the village
and take the rest of the kids.

206
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:44,624
How elaborate. Rude, though.

Sounds like a pretty bad week.

315
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:06,089
Eris actually chose to
stay out of the whole thing.

316
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:08,341
She took it upon herself
to guard the kids,

317
00:21:08,425 --> 00:21:11,261
grinning from ear to ear
the whole time.

318
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:14,097
Maybe that's her
Greyrat blood at work.

319
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,017
[chuckles] I guess
it is cool that we're

320
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,144
in a village of
nothing but beastfolk!

321
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,312
This'll make a great story
for the Boreas family

322
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:22,647
when we get back!

323
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:25,650
Won't it? My grandfather
is gonna be super jealous.

324
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:27,986
Oh, I can't wait to see him!

325
00:21:32,115 --> 00:21:36,828
[GRABEL] Sauros Boreas Greyrat,
overlord of Fittoa.

326
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:38,663
The negligence and
gross incompetence

327
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:41,416
you have exhibited in
response to this mana disaster

328
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:44,919
have thrown our people
into nigh irreparable chaos.

329
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,088
You are hereby
relieved of your duty

330
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,883
and sentenced to
death by beheading.

331
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:52,761
[DARIUS] Rest easy knowing
your dear Fittoa will be safe

332
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:56,139
in the hands of your
humble servant Darius.

333
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:02,520
[SAUROS]
Lowlife scum.

334
00:22:04,314 --> 00:22:08,693
[SAUROS]
Eris. My dearest granddaughter.

335
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:11,321
If you still draw breath...

336
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:15,492
[SAUROS] ...I wish you
a lifetime of happiness.
