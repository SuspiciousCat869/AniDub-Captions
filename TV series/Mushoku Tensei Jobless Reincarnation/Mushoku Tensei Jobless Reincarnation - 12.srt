1
00:00:21,886 --> 00:00:25,557
Wow! Look, Rudeus!
It's the ocean!

2
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:29,644
[ERIS giggles]

3
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:43,616
It's salty!

4
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,243
Yeah, now that I think about it.

5
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:47,454
You've never seen
the ocean before, have you?

6
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:48,955
Let's jump in!

7
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,332
But we don't have bathing suits.
I bet we could find some--

8
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,668
[ERIS] I don't know
what that is. Hold this!

9
00:00:55,712 --> 00:00:56,796
[RUDEUS]
Hold up.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,091
Does that mean
she's going to swim naked?

11
00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:02,886
Well. Eris is 13 now.

12
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,971
And it's been a while
since I snuck a peek.

13
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:08,099
[RUDEUS chuckles]

14
00:01:08,183 --> 00:01:10,435
[RUIJERD]
I would advise against it.

15
00:01:10,518 --> 00:01:13,188
This sea is teeming
with monsters.

16
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,443
[RUDEUS, ERIS]
Come on!

17
00:02:45,947 --> 00:02:51,953
[TALHAND] Oh! We made it!
Solid ground at last!

18
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:55,749
Ugh, don't be such a baby.

19
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:57,250
You see what I
have to deal with?

20
00:02:57,334 --> 00:03:00,003
[TALHAND]
Hey! Who you callin' a baby?

21
00:03:00,086 --> 00:03:02,005
Huh? Get back here!

22
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:05,425
[ROXY sighs]
You two can fight later.

23
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:07,260
Please don't forget
why we're here!

24
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:09,512
And don't wander too far off!

25
00:03:09,596 --> 00:03:10,722
[CAPTAIN 12A]
Wait a sec.

26
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:12,682
You guys're
"Dead End," aren'tcha?

27
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:14,184
Huh?

28
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:16,936
Word about you three has been
makin' the rounds lately.

29
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,522
"Mad Dog" Eris, right?

30
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:21,983
And "Guard Dog" Ruijerd.

31
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:24,235
[RUDEUS]
Whoa! We've got nicknames?

32
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,945
And you're...

33
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:29,157
Gimme a sec. It's, uh...

34
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,784
[RUDEUS]
The suspense is killing me!

35
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:32,744
I just hope it's not
"horndog" or something.

36
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:35,163
Oh, yeah! Rudjerd!

37
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:37,457
"Kennel Master" Rudjerd!

38
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,502
Huh?

39
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:41,795
[CAPTAIN 12A]
All righty...

40
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:43,254
[RUDEUS]
Really?

41
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:45,757
Sure, I borrow his name
sometimes to help boost his rep,

42
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,176
but can I be my own dude
for five seconds?

43
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:50,011
I've busted my buns
for a year now!

44
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:52,639
Gimme a little recognition!

45
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:54,808
"Kennel Master" isn't
a bad nickname, though.

46
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:57,519
I'd love to muzzle
Eris sometimes.

47
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,899
[gasps] Two hundred
green ore coins?!

48
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:17,914
Let's call this
meeting to order.

49
00:04:17,997 --> 00:04:20,125
We need to discuss our funds.

50
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:24,087
Ruijerd's passage by ship
will cost 200 green ore coins.

51
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,381
That's more than
we've made in a year.

52
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:28,758
Even if we prioritize
S-ranked jobs,

53
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:31,594
we may never raise enough.

54
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:33,722
Yeah, that's no good.

55
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:36,975
We're not gonna--?

56
00:04:37,058 --> 00:04:38,309
We can't leave him here!

57
00:04:38,393 --> 00:04:40,645
Of course not.
That's out of the question.

58
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:43,106
Okay, then what are we gonna do?

59
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:45,608
I'm not sure yet.

60
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:47,986
I need a little
more time to think.

61
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:49,195
I have an idea.

62
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,072
What if you run
across the ocean?

63
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:53,408
[RUIJERD]
That is not a skill I possess.

64
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:56,244
[ERIS]
Aww. That woulda been cool.

65
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:05,879
[RUIJERD]
Rudeus. Please forgive me.

66
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:08,048
This is all my fault.

67
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:13,511
I'll keep trying to think
of something else, too!

68
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:16,097
It'll all work out.

69
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:19,309
Let's take a couple of days
to scout our options!

70
00:05:19,392 --> 00:05:20,935
Thank you both.

71
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:37,619
[RUDEUS] How am I going to
get us out of this one?

72
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,044
Hey there! It's been a while.

73
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,758
[RUDEUS groans] Here I thought
I'd seen the last of

74
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:53,885
Mr. stupid no-face.

75
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:58,598
Oh! Well, my advice landed you
in real hot water

76
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:00,100
the last time around.

77
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:02,686
So I wanted to
give you some space.

78
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:04,521
I was embarrassed.

79
00:06:04,604 --> 00:06:08,108
How 'bout that, even gods
have a sense of shame.

80
00:06:09,609 --> 00:06:13,071
I meant for you to turn those
pet thieves into the guards.

81
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:16,449
You could've bonded
with Ruijerd over it all.

82
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:19,202
But no, you decided
to recruit them!

83
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:21,204
I never saw that coming!

84
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:22,622
Though, I gotta admit,

85
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:25,667
I had a blast
watching it play out.

86
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,461
[RUDEUS]
Yeah, well, it sucked for me.

87
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:32,132
Hey. If you hadn't've
gone through all that,

88
00:06:32,215 --> 00:06:34,634
you may not've made it this far!

89
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,554
[RUDEUS]
So the ends justify the means?

90
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:41,099
Naturally,
results are everything!

91
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:43,309
You're a real jag.

92
00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:48,398
It's not an apology,
but I've got more advice.

93
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:50,650
Buy some food
from a street vendor

94
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:52,485
and take a stroll through
the back alleyways.

95
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:55,321
Show me on the doll
where I asked.

96
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:59,993
Though might as well ask why.

97
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:03,496
[chuckles]

98
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,457
I can't tell you
everything, friend!

99
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,001
Wouldn't wanna
spoil the surprise.

100
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:10,795
So, then. I'll be on my way.

101
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:11,755
Hey!

102
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:13,089
[MAN-GOD]
Mmbye!

103
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:15,675
[RUDEUS] You can't just
come and go as you please!

104
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:23,892
[RUDEUS sighs]

105
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:39,532
So, uh. Rudeus said
we should split up today.

106
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:41,785
What do you think he's up to?

107
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:44,079
Your focus should stay
on your opponent!

108
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:52,462
[gasps]

109
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:54,381
You're wide open!

110
00:07:58,635 --> 00:08:00,261
I did it.

111
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:06,434
I did it! I landed a hit!

112
00:08:08,853 --> 00:08:12,649
[ERIS]
Yes! I did it! I won!

113
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:16,194
I'm getting stronger!
I'm amazing!

114
00:08:20,073 --> 00:08:21,991
[RUDEUS]
This seems pointless.

115
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:23,993
I'm not sure what that
self-proclaimed "god"

116
00:08:24,077 --> 00:08:25,578
wants from me.

117
00:08:25,662 --> 00:08:29,791
Other than the joy of watching
me overcomplicate everything.

118
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:31,459
So this time,

119
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:34,212
I'm gonna follow their
instructions to the letter.

120
00:08:34,295 --> 00:08:37,132
I won't think about it
too hard or stray off course.

121
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:42,095
That'll keep 'em from
having any fun! [chuckles]

122
00:08:43,096 --> 00:08:46,641
[RUDEUS] Wait. Doesn't that
just make me a puppet?

123
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:48,268
[RUDEUS gasps]

124
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:54,649
[RUDEUS] I wonder what
Roxy's doing right now.

125
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,572
[ELINALISE]
Ahh! Yes! Get me, beast man!

126
00:09:00,655 --> 00:09:03,116
I'll grab you by
the elf ears, yes!

127
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:04,701
I'm almost--!

128
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:07,871
[RUDEUS] Ohh... Oop, nope I'll
take care of you later, lil guy.

129
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,367
[RUDEUS]
Really? Her?

130
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:56,169
[KISHIRIKA]
Delicious! Yes! Amazing!

131
00:09:58,213 --> 00:10:01,132
[KISHIRIKA]
That's scrumptious!

132
00:10:10,517 --> 00:10:12,602
[KISHIRIKA]
You have my deepest thanks.

133
00:10:12,686 --> 00:10:15,021
This will sustain me for
another year, at least.

134
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:17,941
[RUDEUS] I doubt it.
What are you, an isopod?

135
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:21,069
[KISHIRIKA]
Now! Your name, peasant!

136
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:23,947
Hello, my name is
Rudeus Greyrat.

137
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,199
[KISHIRIKA]
I see!

138
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:31,204
And I am Kishirika Kishirisu!

139
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:34,416
Also known as...

140
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:39,379
...the Great Emperor
of the Demon World!

141
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:41,089
Yeah!

142
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:43,383
[KISHIRIKA]
Yeah!

143
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:46,386
[RUDEUS]
This poor kid.

144
00:10:46,469 --> 00:10:49,389
Playing "Demon Emperor"
out here alone.

145
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:51,975
All right. I'll play along.

146
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:58,148
[RUDEUS] Of course!
I beg your pardon, my liege!

147
00:10:58,231 --> 00:11:04,070
[gasps] Aw, yeah!
Now that's what's up!

148
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:07,073
That's the kind of reaction
I've been waiting for!

149
00:11:07,157 --> 00:11:10,201
Most of the youth these days
don't know their manners, so!

150
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:13,288
I was simply ignorant of
Your Majesty's resurrection!

151
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:15,915
I do hope you can forgive
my impertinence.

152
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:18,793
Yes, very well, but only once!

153
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:20,128
Hm?

154
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:29,637
Oh. Uck. That's nasty!

155
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,932
What's your deal?
You're so freaky-lookin'!

156
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:36,353
What are you?
What aren't you?

157
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:37,979
Did you eat your twin
in the womb or something?

158
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:39,647
[RUDEUS] A toddler
dressed like a succubus

159
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:42,859
thinks I'm the freak? Sure.

160
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:47,781
Now, it's clear that your
generosity saved my life.

161
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:52,327
So! I shall grant you one wish!

162
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:56,915
Okay. I'd like fabulous wealth?

163
00:11:56,998 --> 00:11:58,667
Out of the question!

164
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,503
Isn't it obvious
that I'm flat broke?

165
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:04,047
Right. Well then how
about half the world?

166
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,884
You wanna rule
half of the whole world?

167
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,679
That's a big wish!

168
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:13,181
Unfortunately, I never
conquered the world,

169
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:15,308
so I don't have half to give.

170
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:17,394
Ah, that's too bad.

171
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:19,813
Guess you'll just have to
pay me with your body.

172
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:22,190
Oh, hey! That I can do!

173
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:24,401
You're quite young
to be so lecherous!

174
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:25,735
Kinda makes me worry
about your future...

175
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:27,821
I'm obviously kid--

176
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:30,573
[KISHIRIKA]
Please be gentle with me.

177
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:34,202
[RUDEUS gasping]

178
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:35,453
[KISHIRIKA]
Wait, I forgot!

179
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:38,832
I'm already engaged
in this incarnation!

180
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:42,043
[RUDEUS sighs]
Great, so money, the world,

181
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:44,629
and your body are all out.

182
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:46,047
What can you give me?

183
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:48,133
Foolish mortal!

184
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:51,386
When the Great Emperor
Kishirika offers you a gift,

185
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:53,054
you choose a demon eye!

186
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:55,140
Sounds great.
How much are they worth?

187
00:12:55,223 --> 00:12:56,808
They're not worth any money!

188
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:58,643
So don't even think
about selling it!

189
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:00,770
[RUDEUS]
Hmm, I see.

190
00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:03,481
All right, what kind
do you wanna give me?

191
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:06,401
I think I know just the thing.

192
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:07,610
'Kay.

193
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:12,157
[RUDEUS screams]

194
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,286
Pipe down, you big weenie,
boys aren't supposed to cry.

195
00:13:17,787 --> 00:13:19,372
[RUDEUS]
Damn you!

196
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:26,171
My eye! My eye!

197
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:28,256
See, you're fine.

198
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,966
Pretty cool, amiright?

199
00:13:33,428 --> 00:13:36,139
Thanks once again
for all the food!

200
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:39,601
If you're ever in a bind,
don't hesitate to call on me!

201
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:41,686
Fare thee well!

202
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,272
Away!

203
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,775
[gasps]

204
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:50,987
[cackles]

205
00:13:52,113 --> 00:13:55,825
[RUDEUS] And that's how I
gained the Eye of Foresight.

206
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,630
I don't understand
how I'm supposed to

207
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:11,508
adjust to this stupid thing.

208
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:14,302
Ah? You wanna learn
to watch where

209
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,845
you're walkin', there, asshole?

210
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:19,516
[RUDEUS] I'm so sorry.
My eyes aren't very good.

211
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:22,352
Heh. Yeah, well,
be more careful.

212
00:14:22,435 --> 00:14:24,771
Not everyone's
as friendly as me.

213
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:26,690
Hey! You hear me?

214
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:29,401
I'm talkin' to you!

215
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:30,610
[gasps]

216
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:39,202
You little--

217
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:40,620
[gasps]

218
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:44,332
Huh?

219
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:51,923
[RUIJERD]
You met the Great Emperor?

220
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:54,968
I had no idea
that she'd returned.

221
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:56,803
[RUDEUS]
Do you know her?

222
00:14:56,886 --> 00:15:00,140
[RUIJERD] I've never met her,
no, but I've heard plenty.

223
00:15:00,223 --> 00:15:02,809
Her name is Kishirika Kishirisu.

224
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:06,312
As you now know, she can bestow
demon eyes on her followers.

225
00:15:06,396 --> 00:15:09,274
She herself possesses
12 of varying effects.

226
00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:11,317
[RUDEUS]
So what is she doing here?

227
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:12,902
[RUIJERD]
Who can say?

228
00:15:12,986 --> 00:15:15,613
I don't know what runs through
the minds of emperors and kings.

229
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,657
Kneel before me maggots!

230
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:19,826
I guess none of us do.

231
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:26,249
[RUDEUS] I'm sorry,
but I think I should stay

232
00:15:26,332 --> 00:15:27,751
in the room until
I get used to this eye.

233
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:29,044
That's fine with me!

234
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:33,006
Thank you for
understanding. Uh...

235
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:37,177
Eris. There's no guarantee
Kishirika is still in town.

236
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,762
Yeah, I know that!

237
00:15:38,845 --> 00:15:40,430
But I'm gonna go
look for her anyway!

238
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:41,681
[RUIJERD]
Good luck.

239
00:15:41,765 --> 00:15:43,725
[ERIS]
All right, Ruijerd, let's go!

240
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:45,393
Come on, hurry up!

241
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:48,605
[RUDEUS] It took me
about a week to really

242
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:51,566
get the hang of this
foresight business.

243
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,278
[RUDEUS] It was surprisingly
easy once I got a feel for it.

244
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:58,406
A lot like silent
spellcasting, actually.

245
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,159
I control my mana
to adjust my vision.

246
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:02,285
The more mana I channel,

247
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:04,371
the further into
the future I can see.

248
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:06,206
Like a temporal telescope.

249
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:08,166
I hope you're ready
for a beatdown!

250
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:09,793
That eye's not gonna save you!

251
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:12,045
[RUDEUS] If I really focus,
I can see about

252
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:15,298
two seconds ahead,
sometimes more.

253
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:16,591
Here we go!

254
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,468
But. She's blurry!

255
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:20,929
And I can see three of her?

256
00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:22,555
They're different possibilities!

257
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,350
If I want to see clearly,
I can't look that far.

258
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:27,852
Now she'll slash from the right!

259
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:29,187
Yes!

260
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:35,026
[RUDEUS]
Here it comes!

261
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:39,155
She'll act like I beat her,
and then throw sand in my eyes!

262
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:42,701
Then a headbutt! Leapfrog!

263
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:46,121
[RUDEUS] And before she
tries to counterattack,

264
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:48,665
I'll pin her down for the win!

265
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,626
That's enough.

266
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:57,298
[gasps] Yes!

267
00:16:57,382 --> 00:17:01,469
[ERIS]
Rudeus. You did really good.

268
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,972
Thank you.

269
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:06,558
Ha!

270
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:14,482
[ERIS]
I'm leaving!

271
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,734
Eris--

272
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:22,323
You fought
incredibly well, Rudeus.

273
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:25,035
I once knew a Superd
warrior with a demon eye,

274
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:27,787
but he died before
he was able to master it.

275
00:17:27,871 --> 00:17:30,749
Learning to control one
in a week is exceptional.

276
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:32,042
[RUDEUS]
You mean that?

277
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,086
Do you think I could
even win against you now?

278
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,629
You can try it.

279
00:17:36,713 --> 00:17:37,839
'Kay!

280
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:45,764
I shoulda known I didn't stand
a chance against Ruijerd.

281
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:48,600
I heard you got a pretty good
hit in on him, though!

282
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:49,976
You've gotten really strong!

283
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,396
[ERIS] Stop. You don't
have to comfort me.

284
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,108
[ERIS]
It's not fair.

285
00:17:57,192 --> 00:18:00,528
You're good at everything and
I'm stuck trying to catch up.

286
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:05,825
[RUDEUS]
I'm sorry.

287
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:12,374
[ERIS]
I don't need you to apologize.

288
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:21,049
[RUDEUS]
She's absolutely right.

289
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:24,719
It's not like I worked hard
for this eye or anything.

290
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,930
Why'd I get so excited
about beating Eris

291
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:30,225
with a power I
stumbled on by accident?

292
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:32,143
It's basically cheating.

293
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:34,979
[RUDEUS] Not to mention
I've wasted a whole week

294
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:36,564
leveling up when
I'm supposed to be

295
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,401
focused on finding ways
to get us home.

296
00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:51,413
Where do you think
you're going at this hour?

297
00:18:51,496 --> 00:18:57,210
[RUDEUS gasps] Just thought
I'd check out the brothel.

298
00:18:57,293 --> 00:19:00,130
And I take it you require
your staff to bed a woman?

299
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:03,008
[RUDEUS] Uh, yeah,
I thought I'd try some,

300
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:04,050
you know. Mage kink.

301
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:06,094
You're selling it, aren't you?

302
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:07,721
[RUDEUS]
N-No.

303
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,182
Yes.

304
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,770
I can't allow that.

305
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,564
I know how important
that staff is to you

306
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:20,567
as a mage and a man.

307
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,736
Just like this is.

308
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:26,406
[RUDEUS]
Yeah. Eris had it specially made

309
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:28,658
for my birthday last year.

310
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:30,118
This staff and that necklace

311
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:32,620
are the most
important things I own.

312
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:38,460
So in a similar situation,
would you sell off this pendant?

313
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:41,296
If I had to, yes.

314
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:42,922
Are you serious?

315
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,552
Have I still not earned your
trust after all this time?

316
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:49,888
What? I trust you!

317
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:51,306
[RUIJERD]
Then talk to me.

318
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:53,850
I'm perfectly capable
of rational discussion.

319
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:55,352
I'd like to think I've
learned some things

320
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:57,312
about the world since I met you.

321
00:19:57,395 --> 00:19:59,564
I've learned how feared
and deeply despised

322
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:01,608
my people are to this day.

323
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:03,151
And now, we're faced with

324
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:06,654
an impossible sum
as a direct result.

325
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,406
And in spite of all that,

326
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,784
you still want to
cross the ocean with me.

327
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:12,035
Do you understand?

328
00:20:12,118 --> 00:20:13,453
I caused this problem,

329
00:20:13,536 --> 00:20:16,039
and I would like to be
part of the solution.

330
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,249
So just tell me.

331
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,711
Why do you insist on shouldering
this burden all alone?

332
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:26,049
We've gone a week
without any leads,

333
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:28,385
and we can't stay here forever.

334
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:31,888
So the way I see it,
we only have two options:

335
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:34,808
I can sell my staff
or we can look for

336
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:37,602
a ship to stow away on.

337
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:39,562
But the problem there is...

338
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:41,022
Working with a smuggler,
a criminal,

339
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,149
would compromise your values.

340
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:44,442
Even if it works,

341
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:46,903
I'm not willing to
fracture our party over it.

342
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:50,490
[RUDEUS]
So let's just play by the rules.

343
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:52,242
I'll sell my staff
for the money we need

344
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:55,161
to pay our fare legitimately.

345
00:20:55,245 --> 00:20:57,664
It's the smartest way
to go about this.

346
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:03,545
Listen, Rudeus.
I appreciate your consideration.

347
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:06,506
But know this: I would never
surrender my weapon,

348
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:07,966
and you shouldn't, either.

349
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:10,385
My pride won't allow it.

350
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:12,679
[RUIJERD]
Besides.

351
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:14,806
[gasps]

352
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:16,725
[RUIJERD]
What would Eris think?

353
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:17,851
Giving up your staff would

354
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:20,937
"fracture our party"
just as badly.

355
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:30,447
For you, I'll turn
a blind eye to all evil

356
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,449
until we've made it
across the ocean.

357
00:21:32,532 --> 00:21:35,076
[gasps]

358
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,786
I've made my choice.

359
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,914
Go look for your
smugglers, Rudeus.

360
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,250
And we'll get through
this together.

361
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:45,795
That's the end
of the discussion.

362
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,258
Speaking to each other
from the heart is hard work.

363
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,594
But it's always worth it, yes?

364
00:21:56,431 --> 00:21:57,891
[RUIJERD]
Who's there?

365
00:21:59,642 --> 00:22:02,604
Ooh, couple of tough guys!

366
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:05,523
Relax. I'm not here to
pick a fight or nothin'.

367
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:08,109
Just wanted to say thanks
for saving my noggin

368
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,778
from gettin' busted open.

369
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,238
Oh, you're the guy
from the other day.

370
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:15,241
Yep. It's a pleasure to
meet you all proper-like.
