All right, but you don't
need to be concerned.

It's nice.

to live in the boonies.

No electricity or gas?
What year is it?

but your mommy used
to be an adventurer!

00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,253
Besides, if he really...

[RUDEUS]
This isn't Europe, is it?

00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,465
But what if next time
he gets so badly hurt

129
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,842
that I can't heal him?

130
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:24,676
You worry too much.

131
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,470
[RUDEUS] Well, this can
only mean one thing.

132
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:31,224
This isn't Earth,
it's another world entirely.

133
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,897
[RUDEUS]
A world of swords and sorcery.

134

[RUDEUS] Now that I'm
two and I can walk,

135
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,122
I wonder if Mom
will teach me magic.

136
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,249
[RUDEUS chuckles]
Magic.

137
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,878
Now there's a word that
would even excite a normie.

138
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,380
I want to try it out
as soon as possible.

139
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,174
Though, there probably
aren't many spells

140
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,468
a toddler can pull off.

141
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,954
[RUDEUS]
Books?

142
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,831
[RUDEUS] There are only
five books in the house.

143
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,708
So either they're
expensive in this world,

144
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,795
or Paul and Zenith
aren't big readers.

145
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,963
Hard to wrap my brain around,

146
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,840
since I used to have
almost a thousand. Heh.

147
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,343
They were all
light novels, but still.

148
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,095
[RUDEUS]
Hmm. That's no good.

149
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,973
I guess I'll have to learn
to read all over again.

150
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,851
[RUDEUS]
A little over a year has passed.

151
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,937
We only have two storybooks,

152
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,314
but Paul's been reading
them aloud to me.

153
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,275
Now I can more or less
read on my own.

154
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,611
They've seen me looking
over our reference books,

155
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,991
but I don't think anyone thinks
I can understand them at my age.

156
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,411
Unsurprisingly, <i>The Magic</i>
<i>Manual</i> is my favorite.

157
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,204
Some of the concepts
are similar to stories

158
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,914
I remember from my old life.

159
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,500
For instance, there are
two ways to perform magic:

160
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,128
incantations and magic circles.

161
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,379
It sounds like incantations are

162
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,923
the more common
method these days.

163
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,591
There's a lot of
interesting background,

164
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,593
but there's one thing
that worries me.

165
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,554
Apparently, the amount
of mana someone has

166
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,556
is basically fixed at birth.

167
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,099
And though power
can be inherited,

168
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:39,060
I don't trust my genes
to do much heavy lifting.

169
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:42,272
Well, I won't know what I
can do until I give it a shot.

170
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:50,196
Uh. Okay, "Let the vast and
blessed protection of water

171
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,198
converge where thou seekest."

172
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,908
"I call forth a refreshing,

173
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,370
burbling stream thereof
here and now: Water Ball."

174
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,958
[gasps]

175
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,213
[gasps]

176
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,060
Shouldn't it go
flying or something?

177
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,314
[RUDEUS]
One more try.

178
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,528
[RUDEUS] This is like practicing
combos in a fighting game.

179
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,782
Concentrate, picture it
over and over again,

180
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,826
really feel it, then unleash it.

181
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,756
Ha!

182
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,716
Huh?

183
00:09:56,137 --> 00:10:00,892
[RUDEUS] But I didn't even
do the incantation. What gives?

184
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,940
Seriously?
I'm out of MP already?

185
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,319
[ZENITH]
Oh, you poor thing.

186
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,154
When you get tired,
you need to go to the toilet

187
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,323
before you fall asleep.

188
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,616
[RUDEUS]
This sucks.

189
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,953
I'm too old to look
like I wet myself!

190
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,622
Damn it. Stop crying!

191
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,502
That was good.

192
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,262
[RUDEUS] Through my experiments
I made a few discoveries.

193
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,098
That stupid textbook doesn't
know what it's talking about.

194
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,809
[RUDEUS] Magic power grows
the more you use it,

195
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,395
and spells work even without
reciting incantations.

196
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,397
Most importantly,
I guess I shouldn't believe

197
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,274
everything I read.

198
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,775
[RUDEUS]
But if it's this easy,

199
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,112
what's the point of
incantations in the first place?

200
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,868
[RUDEUS] Maybe they trigger
magical effects automatically?

201
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,619
I haven't tried
other spells yet,

202
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,496
but I wonder if you can
just say the words,

203
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:07,000
and not focus so strongly
on how a spell feels.

204
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,295
If that's the case,
I see why they're so common.

205
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,297
First of all,
they're easy to teach.

206
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,049
If any schmuck can do magic
with the right phrase,

207
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,510
you don't have to waste time
with convoluted explanations

208
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:21,264
of energy coursing through
your veins and what nots.

209
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,433
The second advantage
is convenience.

210
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,477
Attack magic, obvi,
is used in combat.

211
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,230
It's easier rattling off
a chant than closing your eyes

212
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,567
and concentrating on a spell
in the heat of the moment.

213
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,695
All right. It's way past
your bedtime, kid.

214
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,948
[ZENITH gasps]
Oh! Paul! You're a beast!

215
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,617
[PAUL grunts]
A beast for your love! Me lady!

216
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,994
[ZENITH moans]
Take me to the tower!

217
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,163
[RUDEUS] My growing mana
is another mystery.

218
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,666
Maybe I misinterpreted what
the book was really saying.

219
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,668
Is there an eventual
cap on your mana

220
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,879
that no training can increase?

221
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,506
Or, your max grows
as you get older?

222
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,926
Yeah, in that case,
starting out so young

223
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,970
probably increases
my maximum power.

224
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,890
But it's still too soon
to draw conclusions.

225
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,017
[gasps]

226
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,061
[RUDEUS] And I shouldn't
discount the possibility

227
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,562
that I'm just a badass.

228
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,357
[laughs] This is so easy now!

229
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,109
[RUDEUS]
Whoa, lightheaded. Cool it.

230
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,236
Whatever the case may be,

231
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,696
all signs point
down the same path:

232
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,242
gotta start grinding my skills
while I'm still young.

233
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,493
[RUDEUS]
Okay!

234
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,496
[RUDEUS]
I guess I should figure out

235
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,623
how to make these things fly.

236
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,089
[PAUL grunting]

237
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,843
[VILLAGERS giggling]

238
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,306
Huh?

239
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,516
What the?

240
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:52,313
[RUDEUS panting]

241
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,486
[gasps]

242
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,154
Yes! Finally!

243
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,949
[RUDEUS] Turns out, spells
have an order of operations.

244
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,743
First, you call forth
the element, set the size,

245
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:10,123
then set the speed, and when
you release it, off it goes.

246
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,958
I guess this is
where incantations

247
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,501
might come in handy.

248
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:17,880
I'd been trying to set a firing
speed before finalizing size.

249
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,469
Now that I've built up my power,

250
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,347
let's see what I can do
with Intermediate magic.

251
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:33,771
Okay. "Supple spirit of water
and princess of the streams

252
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,566
that flow through the earth."

253
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:40,820
"Sweep away all that is before
me with your hidden inner might.

254
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,989
Splash Flow."

255
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,867
[gasps]

256
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,079
[gasps]

257
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,345
[VILLAGER 1A]

00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,971

Wh‐What happened in here?

[ZENITH]
Rudy? Rudy!

00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,105
Are you hurt?

262
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,231
[RUDEUS]
N‐No.

263
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,108
Monster attack, maybe?

264
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,652
No way. Not in broad daylight.

265
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,113
What's this?

266
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,494
Now, sweetheart.

267
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,372
You didn't happen to read some
of this out loud, did you?

268
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,374
[RUDEUS] Whoa, lady,
you're freaking me out!

269
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,376
Please don't look
at me like that.

270
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,460
Did I screw up?

271
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,045
Does this world have
witch trials for kids

272
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,296
who use magic or something?

273
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,840
I don't want to get
burned at the stake!

274
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,844
I'm real sorry.

275
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,430
[squeals] Darling,
did you hear that?

276
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,766
I always knew our
little boy was a genius!

277
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,976
Hang on a minute, this is
an Intermediate spell‐‐

278
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,062
That does it, let's look for
a magic tutor right away!

279
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,188
Are you sure that was him?

280
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,272
We haven't even
taught him to read‐‐

281
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,859
With talent like that, he'll
grow up to be an amazing mage!

282
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,069
[ZENITH laughing]

283
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,696
[PAUL] Slow down, Zenith,
we decided that if we had a boy,

284
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,781
he would be a swordsman.

285
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,742
But we didn't know he'd be doing
Intermediate magic by now!

286
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,202
Sorry, a promise is a promise!

287
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,372
Don't talk to me about promises,
you break yours all the time!

288
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,166
Don't throw that in my face,
we're not talking about me!

289
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,001
[LILIA] Why not teach him
magic in the morning

290
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,421
and swordsmanship
in the afternoon?

291
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,925
Either way, we shouldn't fight
like that in front of the baby.

292
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,094
Yes, you're right.

293
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,137
[RUDEUS]
That settled it.

294
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,180
They're getting me a tutor.

295
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,100
Paul doesn't have what
you'd call a "normal" job,

296
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,935
but as the knight who
watches over our village,

297
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,187
he's technically
a low‐ranking noble.

298
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,689
There's no other way
we could afford

299
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,191
a live‐in maid and a tutor.

300
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,486
Still, we live in the
sticks of the outer border.

301
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,530
I didn't think anyone
would apply for a gig

302
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,198
all the way out here.

303
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,784
But they found
someone in no time.

304
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,661
In a sleepy little
town like this,

305
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:57,373
my parents were expecting
a retired adventurer.

306
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,458
You know the type.

307
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,251
A middle‐aged man, or older.

308
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,587
Billowing cloak.
Long, bushy beard.

A veteran spellcaster who
really screams "wizend mage."

00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:13,973
[RUDEUS]
What the hell?

314
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:17,268
Forget a beard, she doesn't look
like she can grow hair anywhere.

315
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,812
My great teacher is
a socially‐awkward loli

316
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,689
with resting bitch face?

317
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,025
She's perfect.
I'd totally marry her.

318
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,195
Oh. I take it that you
must be the home tutor.

319
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,030
But, aren't you awfully...?

320
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,573
She's so little!

321
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,117
Well, you're one
to talk, aren't you?

322
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,119
[RUDEUS] Guess she's
touchy about it, huh?

323
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,330
I wasn't even talking
about her chest.

324
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,458
[ROXY] So, where is this
brilliant student of mine?

325
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,668
Oh! He's right here!

326
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:47,089
Ah. Yeah, you hate to see it.

327
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,300
Some kid shows signs of
being an early bloomer

328
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,761
and their idiot parents think
that means they're special.

329
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,472
[RUDEUS]
Uh? We're standing right here!

330
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,057
What was that?

331
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,308
Nothing!

332
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,644
Only that I'm not sure
that a boy your son's age

333
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,230
will be able to
comprehend magic theory.

334
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,314
[ZENITH]
Don't you worry!

335
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,317
Our little Rudy here
is a genius, you'll see!

336
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,070
[sighs] I understand.

337
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,656
In that case,
I'll do what I can.

338
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,533
Wait. Are we doing it outside?

339
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,076
[ROXY]
Naturally, where else?

340
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,410
Huh?

341
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,961
[ROXY] Generally speaking,
there are only

342
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,088
three different types of magic.

343
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,924
Those are attack, healing,
and summoning magic.

344
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,509
Spells and the
mages who cast them

345
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,511
are divided into seven ranks.

346
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,680
Elementary,
Intermediate, Advanced,

347
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,099
Saint, King, Emperor, and God.

348
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,433
To use any kind of spell,

349
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,561
you need to tap
into magical power.

350
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,437
This can either be
your own innate power,

351
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,107
or a dedicated magic circle
for whatever spell you're‐‐

352
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,359
Uh‐‐ Hey. What's the matter?

353
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,194
[RUDEUS]
Uh, nothing.

354
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,907
Anyway. I'll start by
showing you an incantation.

355
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,617
Repeat after me.

356
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,870
Do you have to say
the incantation?

357
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,872
Yeah, how else
are you gonna cast?

358
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,834
[RUDEUS]
Confirmed: I'm a badass.

359
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,170
[sighs] Let the vast and
blessed protection of water

360
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,714
converge where thou seekest.

361
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,092
I call forth a refreshing,
burbling stream thereof here.

362
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,719
Water Ball!

363
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,684
What do you think?

364
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,061
[RUDEUS] Uh, miss?
My mom loves that tree

365
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,105
and spends lots of
time caring for it,

366
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,274
she's gonna be angry
that you broke it.

367
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:32,236
[gasps] Uh. Don't move,
I'll be right back.

368
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,281
Let this divine power
be rich and nourishing.

369
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,783
Offering those whose
strength has been lost,

370
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,744
the strength to rise again.

371
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,203
Healing!

372
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,665
[RUDEUS]
Whoa, not bad!

373
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,084
You can use healing
magic just like my mom!

374
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,753
[ROXY]
Yes, up to Intermediate level.

375
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,838
Awesome! You're really talented!

376
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,007
Not really. I mean,
anyone can do that

377
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,926
with the proper training,
but that's kind of you to say.

378
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,679
[RUDEUS] Flattery will
get you everywhere.

379
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,348
[ROXY]
All right, now you try it.

380
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,474
[RUDEUS]
'Kay!

381
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,936
[RUDEUS] So, Roxy and
<i>The Magic Manual</i> both think

382
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,522
you have to use
incantations to cast.

383
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,399
I've been ignoring
them from day one,

384
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,942
but maybe that's taboo.

385
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:12,985
I'll say them for now,

386
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,696
in case they turn out
to be important later.

387
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,448
How does this one go again?

388
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,158
She just said it.

389
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,827
Let the vast and blessed
protection of water

390
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,663
converge where thou seekest‐‐

391
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,830
[RUDEUS gasps]

392
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,667
[gasps]

393
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,251
[ROXY]
Care to explain yourself?

394
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:33,798
Uh, it's nothing! How did I do?

395
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,717
You cut the incantation in half.

396
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:37,635
Yeah.

397
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,137
[ROXY] Do you always
abridge it like that?

398
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,307
Well, I normally... skip it.

399
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,267
You what?!

400
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:51,357
[ROXY groans] Okay. Wordless
spellcasting. I see.

401
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,944
It looks like this kid will be
worth training after all.

402
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,364
[ZENITH screams]

403
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,700
[BOTH]
Uh‐‐

404
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:09,709
[ZENITH] Roxy! Please don't use
my trees as practice dummies!

405
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,336
Oh, honestly.

406
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:16,424
Figures that I'd screw it
all up on day one. [chuckles]

407
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,426
I suppose I'll be
fired tomorrow.

408
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,678
I'm sorry you got
yelled at, miss.

409
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,555
That was all my fault.

410
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,433
[RUDEUS] Damn it. I haven't
had a real conversation

411
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,976
in almost 20 years.

412
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:30,396
I have no idea what
I'm supposed to do now.

413
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,524
No, wait. I've done this
a thousand times!

414
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,568
Now what would a
dating sim protagonist

415
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,194
do in this situation?

416
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,196
Uh‐‐

417
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,324
And I don't think you screwed
anything up today, miss.

418
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,910
You only gained experience.

419
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,833
Well, when you
put it that way...

420
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,543
Thank you very much.

421
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,093
Ow!

422
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,764
[ZENITH]
If you don't mind, Roxy.

423
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,848
Uh, yes?

424
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,683
Let's head inside.

425
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,978
We'll do proper introductions
over dinner, 'kay?

426
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:17,276
[PAUL]
Hey! Get the lead out!

427
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:23,532
I'm grateful, but I can't
repay your hospitality.

428
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:27,203
You don't have to, silly.
Now, come on in.

429
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,998
[ZENITH]
You too, Rudy.

430
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,291
Okay!

431
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,258
[PAUL]
Now that we're all here,

432
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,886
let Roxy's welcome party begin!

433
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:44,887
[ZENITH, PAUL laughing]

434
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,764
[RUDEUS]
This feels like a dream.

435
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:50,059
Or some kind of fantasy
while I die in the street.

436
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,187
And even if it is, I don't care.

437
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:57,274
In this world, I really
think I can make it.

438
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,778
My last life ended full of
regret and painful memories.

439
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,614
But if I can get up when I fall,
and keep moving forward,

440
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,450
I know I'll be okay.

441
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,868
And maybe,

442
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,413
I'll prove that even a jobless,
reclusive bum like me

443
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,791
won't waste a second chance...

444
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,963
[RUDEUS]
...to get serious about living.
