[gasps]

00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:21,715
Are you all right?

4
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:24,050
[RUDEUS]
Yeah.

5
00:02:31,307 --> 00:02:33,560
[RUIJERD]
Who is the "Man-God"?

6
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:48,241
[RUIJERD] The Man-God
and the Dragon God.

7
00:02:48,324 --> 00:02:50,702
Two of the Seven Gods of old.

8
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:53,788
Hard to believe they're
still fighting in this age.

9
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:59,836
You should also know,
the Superd's poor reputation

10
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,505
is actually due to a curse.

11
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:04,007
[gasps]

12
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,176
[RUDEUS] Laplace transferred
his own curse to his spears,

13
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:08,219
and when he gifted
those to the Superd...

14
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:09,596
[gasps]

15
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:15,101
[sighs] Then I suppose
everything we've done

16
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:16,936
has been for naught.

17
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,857
But the Man-God did say,

18
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,401
unlike most curses,
this one is fading.

19
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:24,944
[RUIJERD]
What?

20
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:27,572
You still carry a bit of it,
but cutting your hair helped.

21
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:28,990
Is that true?

22
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:29,824
[ERIS groans]

[RUDEUS gasps]

24
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:34,245
[RUDEUS] Mm-hm.
What remains now is mostly

25
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:35,705
just deep-seated prejudice,

26
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:38,541
but with hard work,
that'll fade, too.

27
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,711
All right.

28
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:47,801
That's quite a relief.

29
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:57,477
Well. I should prob'ly
get back to sleep.

30

Of course.

00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,456
What are you working on?

32
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,833
I was hoping I could figure out

33
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,335
one of the spells that
Orsted used against me.

34
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:24,421
Why, what did he do with it?

35
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:26,798
[RUDEUS]
He nullified all of my spells.

36
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:29,092
[ERIS]
Oh, so, why are you...?

37
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:30,760
[RUDEUS]
Research, mostly.

38
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:32,345
If we ever run into
Orsted again,

39
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:35,306
I want to know I can
at least get away from him.

40
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:33,698
[PAUL] Aw, you done?
That can't be all you got!

[LILIA] Master Rudeus, would you
hang that one up, please?

00:05:37,118 --> 00:05:38,411
[RUDEUS]
Okay!

43
00:05:40,914 --> 00:05:43,375
That's much better!
Keep up the good work!

[RUIJERD]
So, this is your homeland.

53
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:40,807
It is, but you'll have to
take my word for it

54
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,560
that it used to be
much more beautiful.

Understood.
I wish I'd seen it then.

[RUIJERD] Well, this is
where I take my leave.

[gasps]

59
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,219
I am in your debt.

60
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:22,140
For what? I didn't do anything.

61
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:25,352
Not on the Demon
Continent or Millis.

62
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:27,312
[RUIJERD]
That's not true.

63
00:07:27,395 --> 00:07:29,397
You taught me that I have
so many more options

64
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:32,734
than I had ever considered
or even realized.

65
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,535
And I'll never forget
a second of it.

66
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:45,288
The adventurers at
the Guild in Rikarisu

67
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:48,708
smiling at the name "Dead End"
without even a hint of fear.

68
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:51,044
The closeness I felt
with the Doldia,

69
00:07:51,127 --> 00:07:53,672
who accepted me
regardless of my tribe.

70
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:56,549
The Shirone soldiers
who tearfully thanked me

71
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:59,052
for helping to
rescue their families.

72
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:04,265
That had nothing to do with me.
You did all that yourself.

73
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:05,433
No, sir.

74
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:08,186
I couldn't achieve
anything on my own.

75
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:10,313
Four hundred years since the war

76
00:08:10,397 --> 00:08:12,774
and I didn't advance
a single step.

77
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:15,777
Until I met you, Rudeus.

78
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,738
Maybe, but that's still only
because of the Man-God's adv--

79
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:22,075
I care nothing for the words
of a god I've never seen.

80
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:26,037
The one who actually helped me
along was you and you alone.

81
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:27,372
You hear me?

Yeah, what?

00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:40,510
You have incredible talent.

85
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:42,429
Enough to become
far, far stronger

86
00:08:42,512 --> 00:08:44,514
than I could ever hope to be.

87
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:47,642
Whatever. You're lying.

88
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:50,353
You rushed in headfirst
against a powerful god

89
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:52,105
and you're still standing.

90
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:54,524
You must realize
what that means.

91
00:09:01,906 --> 00:09:03,825
Of course I do!

00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:07,412
Good. Good girl.

93
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:18,631
[RUIJERD] Would it be all right
if I treated you two

94
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:21,301
as children for
this one last moment?

I suppose it's time
I returned this to you.

You know. Actually, I'd prefer
that you hung on to it.

Are you sure?

99
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:09,349
I thought this was
a prized possession.

100
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:11,810
Yeah, that's why
I want you to have it.

All right, then. Rudeus. Eris.

102
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:32,664
We will meet again.

[RUDEUS]
There's so much I want to say.

104
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,213
And there's so much more

105
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:44,300
that I couldn't possibly
put into words.

106
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:49,264
I just... don't want to
say goodbye. Not yet.

With great sadness,

I must say we've
lost Lord Philip,

[ALPHONSE]
Lord Philip and Lady Hilda

this herself.

And my grandfather?

[ALPHONSE] I understand
how you feel, Master Rudeus,

00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:07,128
Scum or not, he is a lord.

Are you thinking about
Eris' feelings at all?

00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:13,551
I am thinking about
the Boreas family legacy

and the continued
prosperity of the people

[GHISLAINE] And you intend to
sacrifice her for that?

Yes, if necessary.

156
00:14:21,935 --> 00:14:23,728
Eris, you don't have
to do a thing he says,

157
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:24,729
do you understand?

158
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:26,439
You can run away and be happy!

159
00:14:26,523 --> 00:14:28,274
And what will become

160
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:29,901
You do something for them!

161
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:31,611
Shut up!

162
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:41,663
Go away. I want to think.

163
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,843
Eris. Listen.

164
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:59,305
Did you not hear me?
I want to be alone.

165
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,352
I'll go then.

166
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:22,287
[ERIS crying]

167
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,504
[RUDEUS]
What's that?

168
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:33,423
[GHISLAINE]
The list of the missing.

169
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:41,806
So, uh, my mother still
hasn't been found yet?

170
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,974
[GHISLAINE]
No.

171
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:49,898
[RUDEUS gasps]
Sylphie? It can't be!

172
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:51,066
[GHISLAINE]
Someone you know?

173
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:52,400
It is.

174
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,194
[GHISLAINE] Did you check
the list of the dead?

175
00:15:54,277 --> 00:15:55,570
[gasps]

176
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:03,578
She's not there.

177
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:06,247
Then she's probably still alive,

178
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:08,333
although I couldn't
tell you where.

179
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:12,170
Oh, thank god.

180
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,310
[ERIS]
Are you awake?

181
00:16:30,271 --> 00:16:32,065
[RUDEUS]
Yeah, come in.

182
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:38,613
Hi, Rudeus. Good evening.

183
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:42,367
Hey, Eris. Are you
feeling better?

184
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,910
Yeah, I'm fine.

185
00:16:43,993 --> 00:16:47,163
I mean, I kind of figured this
is how things would end up.

186
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,335
So what do you think
you're gonna do?

187
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:53,753
What do you mean?

188
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:59,092
Well, I mean, about what
Alphonse was suggesting earlier.

189
00:16:59,175 --> 00:17:00,719
Who cares about all that?

190
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:02,345
I kinda figured you might.

191
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:06,474
Rudeus. I'm left
all by myself now.

192
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:10,061
And, you know.

193
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:12,480
I turned 15
not too long ago.

194
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,150
[RUDEUS gasps] I'm so sorry,
it completely slipped my mind!

195
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:18,153
I, um... I could still
get a present for you,

196
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:19,446
if it's not too late.

197
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:21,614
Is there anything
that you might want?

198
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:23,074
A family.

199
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:29,873
Rudeus, I... I want
you to be my family.

200
00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:32,834
Do you mean we'd be
like brother and sister?

201
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,669
[ERIS]
No, I don't.

202
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,756
Whatever you wanna call it,
what I'm trying to say is,

203
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,841
I want to sleep together.

204
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:47,640
[RUDEUS]
Isn't that a little sudden?

205
00:17:47,724 --> 00:17:49,893
[ERIS]
We promised, remember?

206
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:54,022
[RUDEUS] Yeah, but I thought we
promised for when I turned 15.

207
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:56,358
I don't really care either way.

208
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:58,818
[RUDEUS] I do!
What the hell is going on?

209
00:17:58,902 --> 00:18:00,070
Okay, think.

210
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:02,697
Eris is feeling hopeless.
She wants comfort.

211
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:07,035
And I mean, yeah,
I wanna do it, but now?

212
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:09,371
Wouldn't I be taking
advantage of her?

213
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:18,338
[ERIS]
Well?

214
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:25,637
[RUDEUS]
Uh-- Hey! Eris, wait!

215
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:41,861
Well, well. What's this?

216
00:18:41,945 --> 00:18:43,947
[RUDEUS]
It's 'cause you're cute.

217
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:47,992
[ERIS] That means you're
turned on right now?

218
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,371
[RUDEUS]
Yes.

219
00:18:51,454 --> 00:18:54,749
[ERIS]
So you do like me, then?

220
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,167
[RUDEUS]
Yes.

221
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:58,211
[ERIS]
And you want this, too?

222
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,506
[RUDEUS]
Yes.

223
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:04,384
[ERIS]
But you're still saying no?

224
00:19:11,307 --> 00:19:13,059
I'm sorry,
a promise is a promise.

225
00:19:13,143 --> 00:19:16,062
We said we'd wait 'til I'm 15.

226
00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:17,772
How 'bout this, then.

227
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,233
I'm gonna say something
my mother taught me.

228
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:23,862
But it's embarrassing,
so I'm only gonna say it once.

229
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,452
Rudeus, listen close.

230
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:33,621
I want to be your
little kitty, meow.

231
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:21,479
[RUDEUS]
Good morning, everyone!

232
00:21:21,563 --> 00:21:23,023
Or, rather, great morning!

233
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:24,357
Wonderful morning!

234
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:25,859
Ah, don't look so glum!

235
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:28,111
You look like a man who needs
to get some "experience"!

236
00:21:28,194 --> 00:21:30,613
It'll put a smile on your face,
I guarantee it!

237
00:21:30,697 --> 00:21:32,782
And to all you
non-virgins out there:

238
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:35,118
as of today, I'm one of you!

239
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:38,121
I'm a normie now! I've made it!

240
00:21:38,204 --> 00:21:40,457
Oh, my! Would you
look at the time?

241
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,541
If you'll excuse me.

242
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:44,252
I've got plans
with my girlfriend!

243
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,546
Wakey wakey, Eris! It's morning!

244
00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:49,215
Time to have some fun!

245
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:51,301
Eh-- She's not here.

246
00:21:51,384 --> 00:21:54,262
Ah, she must be
embarrassed! Silly girl.

247
00:21:55,555 --> 00:21:57,098
[RUDEUS]
Huh?

248
00:21:57,182 --> 00:22:00,268
Is this her hair...?

249
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:11,363
[ERIS] Rudeus. You and I aren't
well-matched right now.

250
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:13,281
I'm going away.

251
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:26,961
Alphonse, where is Eris?

252
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:30,006
Ahh, she's set out on
a journey with Ghislaine.

253
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,050
Wh-Where to?

254
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:34,427
[ALPHONSE] My apologies,
but she specifically

255
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:36,930
instructed me not to inform you.

256
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:42,811
Oh. I...

257
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,354
Is that so?

258
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,154
[RUDEUS]
But... Why?

259
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,532
I don't get it.

260
00:22:55,615 --> 00:22:59,160
So. Did she dump me?

261
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,538
Abandon me?

262
00:23:01,621 --> 00:23:06,918
And what about "family"?

263
00:23:43,496 --> 00:23:50,503
[RUDEUS sobbing]
