1
00:01:06,222 --> 00:01:08,308
Hey! Feast your eyes!

2
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:10,518
That's the capital of
the Holy Country of Millis.

3
00:01:10,602 --> 00:01:12,354
Welcome to Millishion!

4
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,190
[GEESE]
And with that,

5
00:01:15,273 --> 00:01:17,275
I'm afraid this is
where I leave you.

6
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,152
[RUDEUS]
Huh? All the way out here?

7
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:20,278
At least stay until
we get inside--

8
00:01:20,362 --> 00:01:22,280
We'll see each
other again, boss!

9
00:01:22,364 --> 00:01:23,782
You don't have to miss me.

10
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:25,325
Then go.

11
00:01:25,408 --> 00:01:27,160
But you better teach me how
to cook next time, you got it?

12
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:28,828
Gods, you're persistent.

13
00:01:28,912 --> 00:01:31,623
Why do you want to learn
so badly, anyway?

14
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:34,292
'Cause, you know.

15
00:01:34,376 --> 00:01:35,960
[RUDEUS]
No, Eris, I don't.

16
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:38,880
Why don't you
spell it out for me?

17
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:40,382
Come on, say it!

18
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:43,718
[GEESE]
Anyway, stay safe, big guy!

19
00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:46,930
You as well. Don't get into
too much trouble.

20
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:49,140
[GEESE]
No promises!

21
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:55,397
Oh! Almost forgot!

22
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,024
Make sure you swing by
the Adventurers' Guild, okay?

23
00:01:58,108 --> 00:02:01,319
Uh, yeah, can do.

24
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:03,613
[GEESE]
See ya!

25
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:38,583
[RUDEUS]
Listen up!

26
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:41,252
I hereby call this Dead End
team meeting to order.

27
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:43,296
Clap, everybody.

28
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,048
[ERIS giggles]

29
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:51,012
[RUDEUS] Well, gang, it's been
a year and a half since

30
00:03:51,096 --> 00:03:53,932
Eris and I were teleported
to the Demon Continent.

31
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:58,478
And we've finally, finally made
it back to human territory!

32
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:01,481
Won't be long before we're home!

33
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:03,441
But if it's all right
with you two,

34
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:05,318
I think we should stay put
for a month or so

35
00:04:05,402 --> 00:04:07,237
and pick up a few
jobs in the area.

36
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,613
Seriously?

37
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:10,115
[RUDEUS] I've heard
Guild jobs around here

38
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:11,783
are supposed to pay really well.

39
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:14,994
Saving up could solve some
problems before they arise.

40
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:16,830
Especially considering
we don't know yet

41
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:18,873
what the next boat
is gonna cost us.

42
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:22,127
Aww! But I don't wanna
take another stupid boat.

43
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,754
Since "Dead End" isn't
a well-known name here.

44
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:26,089
I've got a new gimmick for

45
00:04:26,172 --> 00:04:29,426
"Operation Help Improve
the Superd's Reputation."

46
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:35,515
[RUDEUS] After we help someone,
we'll reveal Ruijerd's identity,

47
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:39,352
and give them one of
these figurines as a gift!

48
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:40,729
We can play it off like,

49
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:44,107
"These charms will calm
even the most savage Superd!

50
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,442
In a few short minutes,
they'll be like

51
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:47,902
a long lost brother
from another mother."

52
00:04:47,986 --> 00:04:49,320
You know, somethin' like that.

53
00:04:49,404 --> 00:04:52,198
I didn't realize you'd
made so many of these.

54
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:54,826
[RUDEUS] That said, I'd like
to take tomorrow off!

55
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,286
Why, are you sick?

56
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:57,495
[RUDEUS]
Oh, no.

57
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:59,205
I want to make a few
more of these figures,

58
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,875
and I wanna write a letter
before we get caught up in work.

59
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,293
A letter?

60
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:06,755
Yeah. I wanna write home
to let everyone know we're safe.

61
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:11,009
[RUDEUS] I should have written
a long time ago, honestly.

62
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:12,218
I just keep forgetting,

63
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:14,804
and it's not like I've
had a ton of free time.

64
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:18,391
My family must be worried sick.
I hope they're not mad.

65
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:20,685
Anything you wanna do?

66
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:23,355
As long as we have time,
then I wanna go goblin slaying!

67
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:25,523
I hear they show up
on the outskirts of town.

68
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:27,275
That sounds a little...

69
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:30,278
[ERIS screams]

70
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,033
[RUIJERD] She'll be fine.
Just let her give it a try.

71
00:05:35,116 --> 00:05:37,118
Uh... You sure, though?

72
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:42,415
Well, okay, then.
Maybe you should go with her.

73
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:45,877
[ERIS] I think I can handle
a few stupid goblins!

74
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,797
[RUDEUS]
Talk about famous last words.

75
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,674
That settles that, I guess.

76
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:52,133
Go have fun tomorrow and I'll

77
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:53,760
see you both back here
in the evening.

78
00:05:53,843 --> 00:05:56,054
Works for me!

79
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:59,683
[RUDEUS]
Follow her and keep her safe!

80
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:17,325
[RUDEUS]
Come to think of it.

81
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:20,120
This is the first time
I've ever written to Paul.

82
00:06:20,203 --> 00:06:22,414
I wonder what he'll
find harder to believe.

83
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:24,958
That I made friends
with a Superd?

84
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,334
Or that I got a magic eye from

85
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:28,253
the Great Emperor
of the Demon World?

86
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:29,504
[SMUGGLER 16A]
Move it!

87
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:36,803
That's not good.
Another kidnapping?

88
00:06:36,886 --> 00:06:38,888
[RUDEUS] Must be
a pretty lucrative industry

89
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:41,891
in this world. I would
love to stay out of this

90
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:45,228
and not risk another
exciting stint in prison.

91
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:47,605
But I don't think
I have a choice.

92
00:06:49,357 --> 00:06:50,859
I'm going.

93
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:53,737
[RUDEUS]
Rule one of Team Dead End.

94
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,406
Never abandon a child.

95
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:57,615
Rule two.

96
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:00,368
Never, ever abandon a child.

97
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,704
We can't, we're the good guys!

98
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:06,166
That's how we'll clear the
Superd name little by little.

99
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,254
[SMUGGLER 16A] You're sure
no one followed you?

100
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:12,547
[SMUGGLER 16B]
Yeah.

101
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:25,018
[SMUGGLER 16A]
Are you okay?

102
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:26,394
[SOMAL]
Uh-huh.

103
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:28,646
[SMUGGLER 16C] Hey, let the
boss know we got him.

104
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,773
[SMUGGLER 16D]
On it.

105
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:36,988
[RUDEUS]
How many of them are there?

106
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:39,949
And how do I get that
kid away from them?

107
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:42,702
I can't tell how strong
these guys are by looking,

108
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:44,079
so jumping out
and starting a fight

109
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:46,581
probably isn't
the smartest option.

110
00:07:46,664 --> 00:07:48,833
I guess I'll play
the waiting game.

111
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:51,628
As long as they hold off
on the violence, anyway.

112
00:07:53,088 --> 00:07:57,050
[RUDEUS] I wonder what this
hideout used to be. A church?

113
00:07:57,133 --> 00:08:00,261
Looks like it's been abandoned
for a good long while.

114
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:02,931
Hmm, cloth.

115
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:05,308
It's a bit too small
to be clothing.

116
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:08,687
But something about it
is oddly soothing.

117
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,400
I recognize this texture.
This shape.

118
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:17,195
There should be...
Yep, three holes.

119
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:18,697
[RUDEUS]
Wait, these are panties!

120
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,739
Who goes there?

121
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:20,949
[RUDEUS]
Gah, not good.

122
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:22,033
[SMUGGLER 16B]
He's in the crate!

123
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:23,493
[SMUGGLER 16C]
Show yourself!

124
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:25,954
[RUDEUS] Damn these cowards
and their dastardly traps!

125
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:28,039
[SMUGGLER 16A] We've got an
intruder! Call for backup!

126
00:08:28,123 --> 00:08:30,667
[RUDEUS sighs]
Here goes nothing.

127
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:37,007
[RUDEUS]
Hear me, you foul miscreants!

128
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,967
How dare you snatch
innocent children

129
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,427
from their families
and make them

130
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,346
prey to your twisted lust!

131
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,181
That's called kidnapping!

132
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:47,517
You should be ashamed!

133
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:50,395
What the hell do you
have on your face?

134
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:51,604
And who are you?

135
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:52,647
[RUDEUS]
Who am I?

136
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:55,567
I am the great
"Dead End" Ruijerd!

137
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:58,820
What was that?
Did you say Dead End?

138
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:01,698
[RUDEUS] Sorry, Ruijerd,
I just realized how this looks.

139
00:09:01,781 --> 00:09:03,241
I will save the kid, though!

140
00:09:03,324 --> 00:09:04,868
[SMUGGLER 16B] Go play hero
somewhere else, ya little punk,

141
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:06,036
we're in the middle of
something important.

142
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:07,537
[RUDEUS]
Sunrise Attack!

143
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,955
[SMUGGLERS scream]

144
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:12,167
[RUDEUS]
Are you hurt? Hey!

145
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,463
[RUDEUS]
Weird. This kid seems familiar.

146
00:09:16,546 --> 00:09:17,881
[VIERRA gasps]

147
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:20,467
Whoa! What happened?

148
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,304
You better watch yourselves.
He's young, but he's good.

149
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:27,223
That freak was in my laundry?

150
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:31,978
[RUDEUS] I am so sorry,
Ruijerd. I owe you one.

151
00:09:32,062 --> 00:09:33,480
[RUDEUS chuckles]

152
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:38,276
You disgusting perv!

153
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,028
[SMUGGLER 16D]
That does it!

154
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:42,572
[yells]

155
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:50,080
[RUDEUS] C'mon, lady?
I can't look away!

156
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:53,625
Right. Left. Look at 'em go!

157
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:54,834
[SHIERRA]
Water Ball!

158
00:09:55,835 --> 00:09:56,836
[gasps]

159
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,839
[VIERRA yells]

160
00:09:59,923 --> 00:10:02,300
[RUDEUS]
Oop, so close!

161
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:07,013
[RUDEUS]
Whew. That was a close one.

162
00:10:07,097 --> 00:10:10,517
Stop scuttling around like
a cockroach! You deviant!

163
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,977
Just hold out and
wait for the captain.

164
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:16,106
[MAN]
Relax. I'm right here.

165
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,359
[RUDEUS]
Huh?

166
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:22,696
What? He's just some drunk.

167
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:26,783
[MAN] No reason to gang up on
some snot-nosed little brat.

168
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:30,620
[MAN]
I'll take him down personally.

169
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:34,874
[RUDEUS] Huh. He seems
really familiar to me, too.

170
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,627
But I can't place him
to save my life.

171
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,339
[RUDEUS gasps]

172
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,516
[MAN] This jackass
fights like he does.

173
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:55,437
[MAN yells]

174
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,188
[RUDEUS]
What is he, a dog?

175
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,907
[RUDEUS gasps]

176
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:09,451
[RUDEUS]
This guy.

177
00:11:10,994 --> 00:11:13,788
[RUDEUS] He's way more
intense than his lackeys!

178
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,918
[gasps] No!

179
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:25,800
[MAN]
Rudy?

180
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:27,135
[gasps]

181
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,014
[RUDEUS]
That's why he's familiar.

182
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:33,016
In this entire world,

183
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:36,603
there's only one man
who calls me by that name.

184
00:11:36,686 --> 00:11:38,897
He's my one and only...

185
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,275
[RUDEUS]
Father?

186
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:13,431
So. Rudy.

187
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:17,852
Uh-- Long time, eh?
It's good to see you.

188
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:20,188
Yeah. I guess.

189
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:24,984
I... I'm just amazed
that you're still alive.

190
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:28,154
Oh. Thanks.

191
00:12:28,238 --> 00:12:30,740
But uh, what are you doing
all the way out here?

192
00:12:30,824 --> 00:12:33,326
Huh? "What am I doing here?"

193
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,744
You saw my message, right?

194
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:37,414
No. I... I guess not.

195
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:40,417
[RUDEUS] Yeah. What the heck
is he talking about?

196
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,752
I don't remember
getting any message.

197
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:46,631
Then, Rudy, what have you
been doing all this time?

198
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:50,010
It's kind of a long story,
but just surviving, mostly.

199
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:52,137
[RUDEUS]
If I have to break this down,

200
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,890
I might as well start with
the mana disaster in Roa.

201
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:57,350
So, part one.

202
00:12:57,434 --> 00:12:59,978
I'll tell him how I met
my kindred spirit Ruijerd

203
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:03,398
and of the mayhem we made
in the city of Rikarisu.

204
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:04,441
Part two.

205
00:13:04,524 --> 00:13:05,525
The great mage Rudeus

206
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:07,360
crosses the vast
Demon Continent,

207
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:08,903
righting various
wrongs with the help

208
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:12,657
of loyal sidekicks
Eris and Ruijerd.

209
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:13,867
Part three!

210
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,660
Our hero falls victim
to a devilish trap,

211
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:17,328
and finds himself
a helpless captive

212
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:19,372
in the Doldia village!

213
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:21,499
I can throw in a little
exaggeration for flavor,

214
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,418
but Paul doesn't
have to know that!

215
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:25,879
I think I'll leave out
the Man-God, though.

216
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:28,340
He is a pretty shady character.

217
00:13:28,423 --> 00:13:32,218
Heh! In retrospect, the whole
trip was actually kinda fun.

218
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,430
[RUDEUS] And then when we
arrived in Wind Port,

219
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:36,681
the first thing
that met our eyes--

220
00:13:36,765 --> 00:13:38,058
[PAUL]
All right.

221
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,895
[PAUL] I get the
picture already, kid.

222
00:13:41,978 --> 00:13:44,647
You've spent the last year
and change playing around.

223
00:13:44,731 --> 00:13:49,569
[gasps] No, we actually had
a lot of trouble out there.

224
00:13:49,652 --> 00:13:51,780
[PAUL]
Oh, yeah? When?

225
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:53,990
You made it sound like
one big walk in the park.

226
00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:57,827
Obviously. I told the story
that way on purpose.

227
00:13:57,911 --> 00:14:01,998
And I realize I may have gotten
a little carried away, but...

228
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:05,752
So. Tell me, why didn't
you bother trying

229
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:08,171
to find out if anyone else
had been teleported

230
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:10,590
to the Demon Continent, hmm?

231
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:12,967
[RUDEUS]
Why didn't I?

232
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:15,553
There's really no good answer.

233
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:18,765
The only explanation
I can give is...

234
00:14:18,848 --> 00:14:22,769
[RUDEUS]
I... didn't think about it.

235
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:25,897
I sorta had my hands full.

236
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,109
So you had plenty of time to
help some demon you'd never met,

237
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:30,694
but you couldn't bother
to spare a thought

238
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:33,530
for fellow victims
of a magical disaster?

239
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:36,282
[RUDEUS] Maybe I got
my priorities wrong. Fine.

240
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:38,993
No point in raking me over
the coals about it now.

241
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:40,745
The thought genuinely
never occurred to me!

242
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:42,622
What else do you want me to say?

243
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:43,873
You didn't look for anyone,

244
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:45,875
you didn't write,
but what did you do?

245
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,128
You went adventuring
with a cute little rich girl

246
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:50,005
like you were on
some kinda vacation.

247
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:54,134
You two even had an invincible
bodyguard with ya! Ha!

248
00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:57,429
And then, the first thing you
decide to do in Millishion

249
00:14:57,512 --> 00:15:00,974
is put some panties on your head
and pretend you're a hero?

250
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:04,144
Look, I didn't know where I was
or what I was doing.

251
00:15:04,227 --> 00:15:07,272
But I knew I had to focus on
keeping Eris safe.

252
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:08,356
Can you really blame me

253
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,151
if I missed a few things
along the way?

254
00:15:11,234 --> 00:15:13,111
[PAUL]
I'm not "blaming" you, kid.

255
00:15:13,194 --> 00:15:15,030
Then why do you keep
taking jabs at me like this?

256
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:18,616
Remind me, that Eris girl
is Philip's daughter, right?

257
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,785
Yeah, of course.

258
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:24,080
I've never laid eyes on her,
but I bet she's a cutie.

259
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:26,082
Is that why you
never wrote to us?

260
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,460
Worried that all the extra
bodyguards you'd picked up

261
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:31,546
might get in the way of
your little love affair?

262
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:32,756
[RUDEUS]
I told you already!

263
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,966
I didn't write because
I just forgot!

264
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,927
Hey, Captain? Why don't
you just leave it at that?

265
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:39,596
He is still a child.

266
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,806
This is between me
and my son, thank you.

267
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,475
Please, sir.

268
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:44,934
You're the last person
who should be

269
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:47,604
lecturing me about
women, Father.

270
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:48,897
[PAUL]
Huh?

271
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,358
I didn't go blind over
the last year and a half.

272
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:54,152
And you two seem awfully close.

273
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:57,113
Do Mother and Lilia
know about her, or?

274
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:00,950
No, they do not.
How could they?

275
00:16:01,034 --> 00:16:03,995
[RUDEUS] Oh, then you can be
as unfaithful as you like!

276
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,623
That's quite an outfit you've
got her wearing, by the way.

277
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:08,416
I guess I can expect
a new little brother

278
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,251
or sister any day no--

279
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:13,797
Enough with the bullshit, Rudy!

280
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,798
Look at me.

281
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:16,466
If you made it here,

282
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:18,968
that means you had to have
crossed through Zant Port?

283
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:20,595
So? What does that matter?

284
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,430
Don't play dumb with me!

285
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:25,350
[RUDEUS]
I'm not! I really don't know!

286
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,435
[PAUL]
Huh?

287
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:34,526
--Oh, yikes.
--Was that magic?

288
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:37,237
You little--

289
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,741
No! What do you want from me?
I did my best! Okay?

290
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:45,036
I was stranded in
a totally unfamiliar place!

291
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,038
I didn't have anyone to turn to!

292
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:51,793
And somehow I managed
to make it here alive!

293
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:54,713
Why isn't that good
enough for you?!

294
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,633
[PAUL] You could have
done better and you know it!

295
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,343
That's not true!

296
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:03,096
[RUDEUS]
What is wrong with you?

297
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:05,765
You never used to
look at me like that.

298
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,600
It's not fair, damn it!

299
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:09,185
[NORN]
Stop it!

300
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,481
[NORN]
Leave him alone!

301
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:22,615
Hey, Norn. Do you
remember me? I'm your--

302
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:25,577
Stop bullying my daddy, now!

303
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,745
Huh?

304
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:29,539
[RUDEUS]
I'm bullying him?

305
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:32,000
But... I...

306
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:42,385
Seriously? That's great.

307
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:48,850
[RUDEUS]
Forget it. I'm out.

308
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:50,477
There's obviously
nothing worthwhile

309
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,605
to see or do
in this stupid city.

310
00:17:53,688 --> 00:17:56,858
I'll go back to the inn
and wait for Eris and Ruijerd.

311
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:58,693
Then we can get out of here.

312
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:02,030
Maybe tomorrow or the day after.

313
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:04,741
[PAUL] You're not the only one
who got teleported.

314
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:07,869
Everyone in Buena Village
was caught in the Calamity.

315
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,165
What did you say?

316
00:18:12,248 --> 00:18:14,376
[PAUL] I left messages for you
at the Adventurer's Guild

317
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:16,544
in Zant and West Port.

318
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:19,214
You are an adventurer
now, aren't you?

319
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:21,299
Why didn't you read them?

320
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:25,720
While you were off enjoying
your vacation, people died!

321
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:31,059
[RUDEUS] Right. That mana
explosion was huge.

322
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:33,186
Why hadn't I thought of that?

323
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:35,438
Why did I think
Buena Village was fine?

324
00:18:35,522 --> 00:18:38,817
So, if everyone is missing.

325
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,903
Does that mean Sylphie, too?

326
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:45,115
[PAUL] Figures. You're more
worried about your girlfriend

327
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:46,616
than your own mother, huh?

328
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,162
[gasps] Y-You mean you haven't
found Mother, either?

329
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:54,416
[PAUL]
No. There's no trace of her!

330
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:56,876
Or Lilia, or Aisha!

331
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,628
We've been looking, though.

332
00:18:58,712 --> 00:19:00,839
For everyone who vanished.

333
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:04,050
That's the whole point of
the Search and Rescue Squad.

334
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:08,263
Why would a search and
rescue squad kidnap people?

335
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:10,473
[PAUL] Some of them
had been sold into slavery.

336
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:13,059
[gasps] Th-They what?

337
00:19:13,143 --> 00:19:14,728
[PAUL] People were
teleported without warning

338
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:15,937
to all corners of the world,

339
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,273
and a lot of them were
taken advantage of.

340
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:20,066
Deceived and enslaved.

341
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,694
So we resorted to
forced liberation.

342
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:24,154
[RUDEUS]
Of course!

343
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:27,282
That was one of the kids
who used to bully Sylphie!

344
00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:33,371
I was so sure
you had pieced it together

345
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:36,541
and started doing something
to help a long time ago.

346
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:39,711
But not you.
You were out sightseeing!

347
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:41,171
[RUDEUS gasps]

348
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:17,499
Okay. We can figure this out.

349
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,585
We both got a little
emotional today,

350
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:22,712
but it's not our first fight.

351
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:23,922
Once I get him to calm down,

352
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:25,423
we can plan our
next moves together

353
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:27,550
and it'll be like
nothing ever happened.

354
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:30,387
So first thing tomorrow
I'll go back to that bar,

355
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,889
and see if he...

356
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:40,605
[RUDEUS retching]

357
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:45,735
I'm back, Rudeus!
Get a load of this!

358
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:49,406
After I was done
slaying goblins, I got...

359
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:54,244
[ERIS gasps] Who was it?
Who did this to you?

360
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:55,286
[RUDEUS]
I'm fine.

361
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,288
You're obviously not!

362
00:20:57,372 --> 00:20:58,915
So what happened?

363
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:02,419
I ran into my father
this afternoon.

364
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:03,962
[ERIS gasps]

365
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:06,631
Did he say something
to upset you?

366
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,010
Why would he?

367
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:12,762
You haven't seen
each other in so long!

368
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:14,097
[RUDEUS]
Well...

369
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,892
I'll murder him! Let go of me!

370
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,936
Don't interfere with
family squabbles.

371
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,563
He doesn't deserve
to be so miserable

372
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:23,314
after working so hard for us!

373
00:21:23,398 --> 00:21:25,025
His father should be ashamed!

374
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:28,278
If he's miserable, perhaps
you ought to comfort him.

375
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:29,738
[gasps]

376
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:59,267
Everything's fine. Okay?

377
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,394
I'm here for you.

378
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:04,272
I'm sorry, Rudeus.

379
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,984
I'm... not very good
at this sort of thing.

380
00:22:09,486 --> 00:22:10,862
It's okay.

381
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,243
You're doing great. Thank you.
