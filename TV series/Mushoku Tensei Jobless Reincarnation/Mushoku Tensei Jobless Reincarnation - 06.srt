1
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,846
[PHILIP] You did yourself
proud yesterday, Rudeus.

2
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:16,391
That's very kind.
But what happened was my fault.

3
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,519
I am a little confused, though.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,145
I can see why they
abducted Eris,

5
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,439
but why would they
want me as well?

6
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,149
[PHILIP] You'll learn
there are many uses for

7
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,902
a member of the
Greyrat bloodline.

8
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:31,031
Both politically and
physically, I'm afraid. See?

9
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,994
So your involvement's
off the record. You understand?

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,704
Yes. I understand.

11
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,748
It was all Ghislaine
and I was never there.

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,959
[PHILIP chuckles]
Yes, indeed.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,835
[RUDEUS] The official story
is that Ghislaine

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,714
dealt with the kidnapping
singlehandedly. I get it.

15
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,716
Having a Sword King
on staff is a great way

16
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,302
to show off the strength
and wealth of the house.

17
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,929
And, apparently,
it would be bad if

18
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,390
the "other" Greyrats
knew about me.

19
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,475
Now that I don't get,
but if it's political,

20
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,852
like Philip said,
I'm happy to stay out of it.

21
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,688
[door opens]

22
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,522
[PHILIP]
Hilda!

23
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,357
Good morning, darling.

24
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,650
[PHILIP]
This is Paul's son.

25
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,444
I've just hired him
as Eris's new tutor.

26
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,406
[RUDEUS]
It's a pleasure to meet you.

27
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,658
My name is Rudeus Greyrat.

28
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,995
[RUDEUS]
She must be Philip's wife.

29
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,582
[RUDEUS chuckling]

30
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,709
[HILDA sighs]

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,379
[RUDEUS] I take it she
doesn't like me. What'd I do?

32
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,757
[SAUROS] They told me
Paul's son was in here!

33
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,760
That would be me, sir!
It's a pleasure to meet you.

34
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:34,970
[SAUROS]
Huh?

35
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,516
You're far too polite to be
related to that scoundrel!

36
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,269
Very well, then,
I permit you to stay!

37
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,063
[ALPHONSE] Young Master Rudeus,
it is my great honor

38
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,441
to introduce you to
the liege lord of Fittoa,

39
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,651
Lord Sauros Boreas Greyrat.

40
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,570
My father, and Paul's uncle.

41
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,239
I hear you saved my Eris,
is that correct?

42
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,992
[RUDEUS] Oh, no, sir.
It wasn't me, it was Ghislaine.

43
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,869
Don't you dare lie
through your teeth to me

44
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,412
in my own manor, boy!

45
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,330
[RUDEUS]
Wait, what?

46
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,124
Lord Philip said not to
take credit! I thought...

47
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,460
[SAUROS]
Hm? Philip!

48
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,295
[PHILIP]
Yes, Father.

49
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,133
Huh?

50
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,385
[SAUROS]
You ingrate! You would dare

51
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,679
muzzle your daughter's savior?

52
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:21,433
No, sir. Since Rudeus is
undeniably a Greyrat,

53
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,561
I wish to avoid mere posturing,
and instead show thanks

54
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:27,230
by welcoming him into
our branch of the family.

55
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,734
Ha. If that's your plan,
then go about your business.

56
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,402
[PHILIP]
Thank you very much, Father.

57
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:36,907
[RUDEUS] Really? So, no apology
for clocking his son?

58
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,367
Though, come to think of it,

59
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:42,871
Eris has never apologized
to me, either. Oh well.

60
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,749
Rudeus, I have a request!

61
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,417
Anything, sir!

62
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,838
I want you to teach my
granddaughter how to use magic!

63
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,383
She said she can't get those
spells you cast out of her head,

64
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,343
so let's strike
while the iron's hot!

65
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,595
I would be happy to.

66
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:01,765
[RUDEUS]
Wow. That's a familiar look.

67
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:05,477
I guess Eris got all her, uh,
charm by imitating this guy.

68
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,897
Though I would much prefer it if
Lady Eris asked me that herself.

69
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,440
What'd you say?

70
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,150
[RUDEUS] Well, if she always
forces other people

71
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,735
to speak for her
while she's growing up,

72
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,405
she'll never learn to be a
polite and humble adult! Right?

73
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:21,159
I see. That's a fair point.
I'll discuss it with her.

74
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,831
Eris!

75
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,543
[ERIS]
Coming!

76
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:36,258
Did you talk to him,
Grandfather, is he gonna do it?

77
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,593
[SAUROS] Now listen to me, Eris,
it's high time you learned

78
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,263
how to bow you head and
ask for things yourself!

79
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,766
Really? But you already said
you would ask him for me.

80
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,602
Eris!

81
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,652
Teach me! I wanna learn‐‐

82
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,405
Is that any way to
make a polite request?

83
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,365
[RUDEUS]
You're one to talk.

84
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:08,248
[ERIS] Won't you please teach
Eris how to do magic, meow?

85
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,508
That was wonderful, my dear,
look how adorable you are!

86
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,303
And of course he'll teach you.
Won't you, Rudeus?

87
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,264
Remember to stick your hips out
to look more appealing.

88
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,850
The masters are quite fond
of beast people, you see,

89
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,894
so this pose is meant
to emulate drooping ears

90
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,604
to convey humility.

91
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,690
I don't need reading,
writing, or math, meow!

92
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,485
Only magic, please meow!

93
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:40,447
Adding a meow doesn't
make it polite!

94
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:01,927
Go ahead.

95
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,428
All right!

96
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,025
Don't just swing your arms!
Remember your footwork!

97
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,863
[ERIS]
Let the great protection of fire

98
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,657
converge where thou seekest.

99
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,660
I call forth the bold heat
of a torch here and now!

100
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,328
Fireball!

101
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,416
[gasps] I did it!

102
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,792
[RUDEUS]
Now move this one here.

103
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,795
And 8 plus 5 is 13.
Simple, right?

104
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:22,591
Yes, that makes sense.
I'm finally starting to get it.

105
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,260
[ERIS]
Rudeus, look what I did!

106
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,596
Someday I'll be able to
make huge fireworks

107
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,514
in the sky just like you!

108
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,766
Hey! Are you insane?

109
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,771
Ugh, I wish you were
half this enthusiastic

110
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,316
about any of your other lessons.

111
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:44,988
[RUDEUS]
Huh?

112
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,575
[RUDEUS sighs]
Not again.

113
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,369
Eris? Where'd you go?

114
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,164
[RUDEUS] I've been her tutor
for about a month now.

115
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,541
She still won't listen
to anything I say.

116
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,543
If I reprimand her, she'll run.

117
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,630
If I try to stop her,
she'll punch me and then run.

118
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,965
If I chase her, she'll turn
around, punch me again,

119
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,967
and then hide somewhere.

120
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,928
She can keep it together
for magic class,

121
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,096
but the other subjects...

122
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,899
[RUDEUS] But she looks like
an angel when she's asleep.

123
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,902
Eris. You'll catch a cold.

124
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,614
If you don't wake up,
I'll attack you.

125
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:37,457
[RUDEUS chuckles]
Still a double‐A, I see.

126
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,292
But I sense the
potential for growth!

127
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:43,171
You may yet become
an E or bigger! [laughs]

128
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,423
[ERIS grunts]

129
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,759
Please rejoin us
in class, My Lady.

130
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:51,054
I have so many exciting
lessons planned for you.

131
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,107
[RUDEUS]
Sound asleep, huh? Oh well.

132
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,819
Time to add to my
collection of holy relics.

133
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,753
[RUDEUS]
Here it comes!

134
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,182
[RUDEUS] Looks like she
completely outplayed me.

135
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,184
Flawless victory.

136
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,563
[ERIS]
Hmph!

137
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,192
[RUDEUS] It's hopeless.
Time to consult with Ghislaine.

138
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,071
Surely she knows some way
to get Eris under control.

139
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,415
This sucks! I'm bored now!

140
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,717
Long ago, I thought
a sword was all I needed.

141
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,135
[ERIS]
Hm?

142
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:16,681
In the Fangs of the Black Wolf
party, we had six members.

143
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,517
Two swordsmen,
a fighter, and a thief,

144
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,688
plus one mage and one cleric
to cover our bases.

145
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,857
Business was never
my strong suit,

146
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,692
so the others handled supplies.

147
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,027
So what happened next?

148
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,112
[RUDEUS]
She's hooked!

149
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,531
[RUDEUS] Were my mother
and father in that party?

150
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,826
They were. This would have
been seven years ago now.

151
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,661
[RUDEUS]
I thought that would be it.

152
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,413
You mentioned business.

153
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,998
Have you ever found
yourself in trouble

154
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,084
because you didn't know
how to do math?

155
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,669
Yeah. More than just once.

156
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,047
The worst was after
your parents married.

157
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,758
I traveled alone,
but couldn't calculate money.

158
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,011
So I wound up stranded
with no rations.

159
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,764
I went ten days
without food or drink.

160
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,557
I thought I was gonna die.

161
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,310
I finally gave in
and ate monster shit,

162
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,646
but it gave me the runs.

163
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,523
I was sick for days.

164
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,651
Have you ever fought off
monsters while you had diarrhea?

165
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:14,322
[RUDEUS] She's going all in
with this monster "stuff."

166
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,533
And that's why I
want to learn math.

167
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,284
I'm counting on you.

168
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,793
Rudeus, hurry up and
get on with the lesson!

169
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,093
It would be great if
you could get this fired up

170
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,845
for any of our
classroom lessons.

171
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,638
[GHISLAINE] Watch your opponent
closely and remember

172
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,265
how to shift your stance!

173
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,016
If you can move faster,
create an opening

174
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,601
by putting them
on the defensive!

175
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,854
Then aim for their weak point!

176
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,609
Keep your eyes open!

177
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,361
If you can't charge fast enough,

178
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,864
ready yourself for
a counterattack!

179
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,659
[GHISLAINE] Watch your
opponent's feet and eyes

180
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,161
to predict their next move!

181
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,580
Rudeus! Quit trying
to strategize!

182
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,416
Just think about how
to step in and swing!

183
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,043
[RUDEUS] "Don't strategize,
just strategize," very helpful.

184
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,962
[GHISLAINE]
Eris! Don't let up!

185
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,714
Your opponent hasn't
surrendered yet!

186
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,215
Right!

187
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,675
[RUDEUS]
Oh boy.

188
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,683
[panting]

189
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,144
You've got a long way
to go, Rudeus!

190
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,021
[GHISLAINE]
Don't get conceited, Eris.

191
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,815
You've been holding a sword
for far longer than he has.

192
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:31,983
And you're older.

193
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,234
Yeah, I know!

194
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,029
And he spent a whole bunch of
time learning magic and stuff.

195
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,158
[GHISLAINE] Right. That said.
You're normally very quick,

196
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,827
but your movements are sluggish
when you're on the defensive.

197
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,621
Yeah, I get scared.

198
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,124
When someone's attacking for
real, I overthink it and freeze.

199
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,251
Oh, please! That's pathetic!

200
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,086
People are gonna
look down on you for that!

201
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,046
[GHISLAINE]
No, they won't.

202
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,089
Mages don't train
in close combat.

203
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,800
Really? Guess he can't help it!

204
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,802
[RUDEUS]
What did she hit me for?

205
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,137
You are making progress,

206
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,514
but I'm afraid I can't
fix your flinching.

207
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,849
Fix that yourself.

208
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:05,683
[RUDEUS]
Yes, ma'am.

209
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,560
Okay, Rudeus. Get up already

210
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,771
so we can go another round
before it gets late!

211
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:13,441
Would you mind going a little
easier on me this time?

212
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,902
I'm not holding back
just because you're weak!

213
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,946
[RUDEUS]
Yeah, I figured.

214
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,365
[GHISLAINE]
Okay. Begin!

215
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,879
[RUDEUS]
I'm exhausted.

216
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,049
And I still have to do
tomorrow's lesson plan.

217
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,890
[RUDEUS groans]
This is such a pain!

218
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,853
[RUDEUS] Who knew work
would be so much work?

219
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,442
[RUDEUS]
But I won't give up.

220
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:00,029
I've got University with
Sylphie to look forward to.

221
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:07,036
[RUDEUS] Okay! Eris actually
pays attention in class now.

222
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,248
So I just gotta keep this up
for another five years!

223
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,971
[RUDEUS] And right when
I let down my guard,

224
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,348
Eris started acting up again.

225
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,152
[RUDEUS screams]

226
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,322
[RUDEUS] You know what?
We could all use a break.

227
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,950
[yawns]

228
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,828
[ERIS]
Hurry up! Come on, let's go!

229
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,080
[RUDEUS] Eris, I know
I'm repeating myself,

230
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,916
but while we're in town,
please don't wander off alone.

231
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,794
It would be awful if
you got abducted again.

232
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,629
Mentally speaking.

233
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,802
[ERIS]
I know, I'm not stupid!

234
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,056
And by the way, that outfit.

235
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,265
[ERIS]
Hm?

236
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:14,395
[RUDEUS] They do say "fine
feathers make a fine bird."

237
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,150
It's lovely, My Lady.
You look good!

238
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,777
[ERIS]
I'm going!

239
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,237
[RUDEUS]
What's her problem?

240
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,627
[RUDEUS] As I understand it,
Roa is the largest city

241
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,422
in the Fittoa Region
of the Asura Kingdom.

242
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:45,301
Everything is gorgeous.
Even the outer walls.

243
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,763
Whenever I remember I'm in a
fantasy land, I get all tingly.

244
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,431
Who wouldn't?

245
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,353
[gasps]

246
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,439
[MEN laughing]

247
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,441
[WOMAN 06A]
Just one this time, please!

248
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,317
[GIRL 06A]
What's that?

249
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,652
[MERCHANT 06B]
Wanna try some?

250
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:06,948
So, an apple costs
one Asuran copper.

251
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,659
[MERCHANT 06A]
You there! Young sir!

252
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,827
You mean me?

253
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:15,081
That's an awfully fancy getup.
You come from the lord's manor?

254
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:15,915
[RUDEUS]
Yes, why?

255
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,500
I have something
here that's perfect

256
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:22,296
for a man of your station.
Wanna take a look? Huh? Huh?

257
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,926
[RUDEUS]
What is it?

258
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,470
A highly prized medicine
from Asura Palace

259
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,347
that just came in this morning.

260
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,142
Believe it or not, one sip
will let you go for hours,

261
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,227
and if you give a sip
to your ladylove instead,

262
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,481
she'll be putty in your hands,
if you get my meaning.

263
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:44,026
[RUDEUS] An aphrodisiac!
Ten gold pieces?

264
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,571
Better write that down.

265
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,324
I can't read any of that!
What are those weird letters?

266
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,077
They're my notes, it only
matters that I can read them.

267
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,288
I demand you tell me
what you're writing!

268
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,956
[RUDEUS]
What a little tyrant.

269
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,916
The names, locations,
and prices of goods.

270
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,918
What do you want to know
all of that stuff for?

271
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,921
Comparing market prices
is a basic MMO strat.

272
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,424
"M‐M"? I don't know
what that means!

273
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,217
Okay, here's an example.

274
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,343
[ERIS]
Hm?

275
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,304
[RUDEUS] Something that
costs five large coppers

276
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:15,057
across the street is
being sold here for four.

277
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,310
But here's a question for you.

278
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,271
If you managed to haggle the
price here down to three copper

279
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,315
and sold it across
the street for four,

280
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,983
how much money would you make?

281
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:29,238
Huh? Okay. Five minus three
plus four. Six copper!

282
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,240
[RUDEUS]
What kind of math is that?

283
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,909
[RUDEUS]
Ehh. Wrong answer.

284
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,868
Huh?

285
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,454
Four minus three
equals one large copper.

286
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,789
Ghislaine's our winner!

287
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,167
Well. I was about to
say that next!

288
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,293
[RUDEUS]
Were you though?

289
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,046
And, if I started out
with ten large coppers,

290
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,215
then I would end up
with 11, wouldn't I?

291
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,509
[RUDEUS]
I mean, yeah, but...

292
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,011
Eh, whatever,
I'll compliment her anyway.

293
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,055
Effusive praise
seems to motivate her.

294
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:59,018
Oh, wow, you got that one right!
You're so clever, Lady Eris!

295
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,853
Naturally!

296
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,104
[RUDEUS]
So you see?

297
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,690
Young sir? Do you want it, or?

298
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,858
[RUDEUS]
And with some basic arithmetic,

299
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,195
you can help save money
or even make a little extra!

300
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,030
[ERIS]
Yeah. I guess that makes sense!

301
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,323
[GHISLAINE]
Yeah.

302
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:19,330
[RUDEUS] Hey, I have that book.
Seven gold pieces.

303
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,041
[RUDEUS] From what
I've been able to figure,

304
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,086
that's in the neighborhood of
seven hundred thousand yen.

305
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,254
Woof.

306
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,214
What did Mom have
to do to afford that?

307
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,757
Hey, what are you looking for?

308
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,217
[RUDEUS]
Nothing in particular.

309
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,386
I thought I might find
an interesting book.

310
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,347
[ERIS] If there's something
you want, I can buy it for you!

311
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,934
That's kind of you to offer, but
do you actually have any money?

312
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,103
I'll get Grandfather
to pay for it!

313
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,690
[RUDEUS] I figured.
I shouldn't endorse that.

314
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:50,069
But I do want a book.
I really want a book!

315
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,320
Thanks, but no.

316
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,613
Well why not?

317
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,199
It's not your money to spend,
you didn't earn it.

318
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,701
What's that supposed to mean?

319
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,120
Eris, do you have any idea
how much I get paid

320
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,372
every month to be your tutor?

321
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,750
About five gold pieces?

322
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,168
[RUDEUS]
Two silver pieces.

323
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,672
That's way too little!
What do you get?

324
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,465
I get paid two gold pieces.

325
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,383
[ERIS]
See?

326
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,510
[RUDEUS]
"See" what?

327
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,680
Ghislaine is your instructor
and your family's bodyguard.

328
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,473
And she's one of the
highest‐ranked swordsmen

329
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,393
in the world, so of course
she gets paid more than me.

330
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,437
Then what would I
get paid for teaching?

331
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,230
At your current skill levels?

332
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:30,151
Maybe one silver,
but that's on the high end.

333
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,777
I appreciate the sentiment,

334
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,362
but you should wait
to buy people gifts

335
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,866
until you can save up
your own money, okay?

336
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,784
Fine, be that way.

337
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,245
[RUDEUS]
She's so quiet.

338
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,873
This attitude might be
worth encouraging.

339
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,416
I don't want to
completely shoot down

340
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,918
such a valiant
attempt at gratitude.

341
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,463
Well, hey, how about,
when we get back home,

342
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,049
we can ask Lord Philip
to give you an allowance.

343
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,800
Do you mean it?

344
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,027
[gasps]

345
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,913
[GHISLAINE]
Never seen it before?

346
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,916
[RUDEUS] You're telling me
that's normal? What is it?

347
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,417
[GHISLAINE]
You're kidding me.

348
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:32,171
That is the fortress of
Perugius, the Dragon King.

349
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,881
Perugius?

350
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,049
[ERIS]
Yeah, you know!

351
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,842
He's one of the three
legendary heroes

352
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,303
who defeated and banished
the Demon God Laplace!

353
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,680
Banished who now?

354
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,057
[GHISLAINE] What, you don't
know about him, either?

355
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,476
[ERIS] Ooh! Laplace
was a super evil guy

356
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,020
who tried to wipe out
the entire human race!

357
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:52,733
[RUDEUS] Huh? I feel like I've
heard this story before.

358
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:53,567
But where?

359
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,153
That whole war was like
a thousand years ago.

360
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,865
A lot of the other heroes died,
but Perugius and his 12 servants

361
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,201
went to Laplace's stronghold
and beat him up!

362
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:06,914
[RUDEUS] Oh, I remember!
We had a book about this!

363
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,874
I always thought
it was a fairy tale.

364
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,086
You sure know a lot
about history, My Lady.

365
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,464
So you know, our modern society
was born of that battle.

366
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,467
We're in year 414 of the
Armored Dragon Calendar,

367
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,636
which was named
in honor of Perugius.

368
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:21,637
Whoa.

369
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,889
You have a lot to learn, Rudy!

370
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,559
[RUDEUS] So that whole‐ass
flying castle has been up there

371
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,396
since the war with Laplace
ended 400 years ago?

372
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:34,483
Is this Perugius guy
even still alive up there?

373
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,820
Either way, I'd like
to go there someday.

374
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,286
‐‐Hey, I did it!
‐‐Let's have a look.

375
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,621
[RUDEUS] Eris's mood
has improved drastically

376
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,374
since we started
giving her some time off.

377
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,960
A little R&R goes a long way.

378
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,295
[ERIS]
By the way, I got you something!

379
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,504
Huh?

380
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,801
[gasps] My Lady?
Why do you have this?

381
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,053
You looked like you
really wanted it the other day!

382
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,598
Thanks to you, Lady Eris
now gets an allowance

383
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,099
to do with as she pleases.

384
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:10,519
I even calculated
the change correctly!

385
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,938
Okay! Well, thank you very much!

386
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,566
I'm so glad to hear
your studies are paying off.

387
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,110
But we should get back
to the lesson at hand!

388
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:21,739
Why are you being weird?
What's that medicine for?

389
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:22,656
Don't worry about it,

390
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,992
let's move onto an
extra tough problem.

391
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,911
You may have to work
together to solve it!

392
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,456
Hey, don't change the subject,
tell me what it is!

393
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,874
[RUDEUS]
Uh... gotta go!

394
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,335
[ERIS] Ghislaine!
Capture Rudeus at once!

395
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,169
[GHISLAINE]
On it.

396
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,879
[RUDEUS]
Put me down, I know my rights!

397
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:40,216
Don't treat me like a criminal,
I didn't do anything!

398
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:47,598
[RUDEUS gasps] No, not my
million‐yen aphrodisiac!

399
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,225
I'm sorry, your what?

400
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,143
What's an "aphrodisiac"?

401
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:56,565
Uh... You know.
It's a... [chuckles]

402
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,444
Get back here!

403
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,322
[RUDEUS] I had one hell of a
time talking my way out of that.

404
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:07,076
[RUDEUS laughing] The violent
child and the meathead, here,

405
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,828
are relentless.

406
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:12,456
But their studies are
definitely paying off.

407
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,876
So I think I'll
celebrate that for now.
