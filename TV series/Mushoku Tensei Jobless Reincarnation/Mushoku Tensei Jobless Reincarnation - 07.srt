[yells]

4
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,409
I'm surprised you could
react to that feint.

5
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,745
Keep it up and you'll reach
Advanced rank soon.

6
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:41,124
You mean it?
All right! [giggles]

7
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,544
Ha?

8
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,075
That wasn't so hard!

9
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,247
I'm sorry, but all of
these are incorrect.

10
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,582
[ERIS]
What?

11
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,006
[sighs]

12
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,465
[GHISLAINE] Let the
great protection of fire

13
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,426
converge where thou seekest.

14
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:37,472
I call forth the bold heat of
a torch here and now. Fireball.

15
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,649
Mother! Come look!

16
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,610
Did you see me
do that fire spell?

17
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,446
It's my favorite!
I'm super good at it now!

18
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:57,951
Yes, it looked quite scary.
Don't do anything too dangerous.

19
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,077
[RUDEUS gasps]

20
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,163
[HILDA]
Hmph.

21
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,585
Any clue why she would
be upset with me?

22
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:27,606
[RUDEUS] Finished! Well made,
if I do say so myself.

23
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,569
[RUDEUS]
O Goddess.

24
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,529
[knocking]

25
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,864
One sec!

26
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,617
Yes?

27
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,245
Master Rudeus.
My name is Edna Rayrune.

28
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,998
It's a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

29
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,627
I'm here to consult
with you about Lady Eris.

30
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,838
[RUDEUS]
She needs extra class time?

31
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,049
Indeed. In just
six short months,

32
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,134
the young mistress
will turn ten.

33
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,427
And as I'm sure you know,

34
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,055
Lord Sauros is hosting
an elaborate party.

35
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,225
Nobles from all across
Roa will be attending.

36
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,976
Which brings us to the problem.

37
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,355
The main event will be a dance
performed by Lady Eris.

38
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:11,400
[RUDEUS]
What? Now that I'd love to see.

39
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,069
Good luck. [laughs]

40
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,405
Oh, excuse me.

41
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,990
A noblewoman must have
grace and poise.

42
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,077
And I can't deny that the
young miss is doing her best.

43
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,788
But at this rate,
she won't master courtesy,

44
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,581
much less memorize a dance.

45
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,709
[RUDEUS laughs]
Yeah, I bet!

46
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,793
Pardon, you what?

47
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,546
Oh, nothing. Please continue.

48
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,340
Young Master. If you would
be willing to forfeit

49
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,592
a few of your lessons
every week so that I may

50
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,095
increase my own,
I would be much obliged.

51
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,013
That's perfectly reasonable.

52
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,725
If that's all you need,
then please go ahead!

53
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,351
Are you sure you don't mind?

54
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,812
If it means her special day
goes off without a hitch,

55
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,856
then I'm happy to do it.

56
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,449
[RUDEUS]
And now I've got some time off!

57
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,286
[RUDEUS]
Whoa.

58
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,288
[PHILIP] In this section,
you'll find literature

59
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,248
from other continents.

60
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,211
Uh, what language is that?

61
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,922
[PHILIP] That's in Beast‐God.
Does it interest you?

62
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,924
As long as I have
a bit of free time,

63
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,218
it might be fun to
learn a new language.

64
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,555
[PHILIP chuckles] Well,
Beast‐God is a wonderful tongue.

65
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,099
And learning would allow
you to hire beast people

66
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,059
to work for you someday!

67
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,479
That is an
attractive proposition.

68
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,732
[PHILIP] Ahh, do you appreciate
their charms as well?

69
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,402
Yes. I had never met one
before Ghislaine came for me.

70
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,987
But now I can't get enough.

71
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,697
Their ears are so cute!

72
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,366
Yes, sir! I know
exactly what you mean!

73
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,911
I'm especially fond of
those fluffy tails.

74
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,454
When they begin to
twitch with emotion,

75
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,081
it just makes me wanna...

76
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,626
You really do have Greyrat
blood, don't you, Rudeus?

77
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,630
Lord Philip. I've decided to
study the Beast‐God language!

78
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,798
Very well, then.

79
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,509
Feel free to check out any
other books on the subject.

80
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,968
[RUDEUS]
May I come back and borrow books

81
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,678
in other languages, too?

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,513
[PHILIP]
You may.

83
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,348
[RUDEUS]
I appreciate it!

84
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,018
[RUDEUS] I hope this
finds you well, Master Roxy.

85
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,646
Let me report. I've begun
studying the languages

86
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,148
of other continents
in my free time.

87
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,318
Battle‐God, Beast‐God,
Demon‐God.

88
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,028
Surely there are
even more out there

89
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,530
that I don't know about yet.

90
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,950
This kid brain learns faster
than I ever used to,

91
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,910
so I'd better
branch out my skill tree

92
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,037
while I have the chance.

93
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,129
[RUDEUS] Come on!
This doesn't make any sense!

94
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,006
[RUDEUS] Battle‐God is
close enough to Human,

95
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,300
so I can more or less
figure it out on my own.

96
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,553
And I can ask Ghislaine
about Beast‐God.

97
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,931
But Demon‐God is
impossible. I'm stumped.

98
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,183
[ERIS]
Just forget it!

99
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,227
Wait!

100
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,603
Eris?

101
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,149
I'm terribly sorry you
had to witness that fuss.

102
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,901
What happened in there?

103
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:04,197
Lady Eris. She runs off every
time I try and correct her.

104
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,533
[RUDEUS]
Ah, you have my sympathy.

105
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:07,701
Thank you.

106
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,245
But if this keeps up,
she'll embarrass herself.

107
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,122
That's less than ideal.

108
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,625
Yes. Imagine becoming the
laughingstock of your family,

109
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,420
and on your own
birthday, no less.

110
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:22,132
It would be quite the tragedy
for her, wouldn't you agree?

111
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,593
So, uh, is there something
I can do for you?

112
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,679
Would you be so kind as to
speak to her on my behalf?

113
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,891
Please convince her to
return to her lessons!

114
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,060
[sighs]

115
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,695
[RUDEUS]
I thought I'd find you here.

116
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,948
I heard you're having trouble
with dance lessons‐‐

117
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,909
[RUDEUS gasps]

118
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,085
[RUDEUS] Will you please
go back to practice?

119
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,339
[ERIS]
I don't need to learn to dance.

120
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,173
[RUDEUS]
But...

121
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,050
[ERIS]
I'll just skip the party.

122
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,345
[RUDEUS] It's a party
for you, you can't skip it.

123
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,180
[ERIS] I'm sick of
people forcing me to do

124
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,390
things I'm no good at.

125
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,895
[RUDEUS]
I know how she feels.

126
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,482
That's part of why I went
through my old life on auto.

127
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,444
But if she keeps this up, she'll
have all the same regrets.

128
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,529
"If only I'd tried harder."

129
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,616
[ERIS]
But you can do everything,

130
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,160
so you wouldn't get that.

131
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,914
[RUDEUS] No, there are plenty
of things that I can't do.

132
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,248
[ERIS]
Really?

133
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,250
Yeah, of course there are.

134
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,086
For example,
I started trying to learn

135
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,880
a couple of foreign
languages recently,

136
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,967
and I still can't make
heads or tails of them.

137
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,719
But I'll keep studying anyway.

138
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:50,971
[ERIS]
Why?

139
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,432
[RUDEUS] That's a hard
question to answer.

140
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,646
[RUDEUS] Maybe it's because
the worse I am at something,

141
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,816
the better it feels when
I finally figure it out.

142
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,484
Does that make sense?

143
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,949
[RUDEUS] So will you give
dance practice another try?

144
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,034
I'll help, if you like.

145
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,883
[sighs]

146
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:35,557
[ERIS] Well, come on, then!
I'm not gonna dance alone!

147
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,855
Yes, of course.
I'm right behind you, My Lady.

148
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,654
Take a deep breath
and relax a little!

149
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,197
I'm totally relaxed!

150
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,700
[RUDEUS] You're going too fast!
Stick to the rhythm!

151
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,201
[ERIS]
Maybe you're just too slow!

152
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,664
[gasping]

153
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,714
[RUDEUS]
What a nightmare.

154
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,508
This is so much worse
than I thought.

155
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,523
Ugh, I don't get it!

156
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,066
[knocking]

157
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,901
[MAID 07A]
Excuse me, Master Rudeus.

158
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,778
I have a package for you.

159
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,784
What is this? It's heavy.

160
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,914
[RUDEUS gasps]
It's from Roxy! She wrote back!

161
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,294
It even still smells like her.

162
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,677
[ROXY] Dear Rudeus.
I received your letter.

163
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,637
How are you eight already?

164
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,182
I'm sure you've grown so much
since I last heard from you.

165
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,351
My jaw dropped when I
read that you became

166
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,604
the home tutor for the lord
of Fittoa's granddaughter.

167
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,314
Well done.

168
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,359
And you're even training
under the Sword King Ghislaine!

169
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,071
[ROXY sighs] It seems like
only yesterday you were

170
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,199
that five‐year‐old boy
spying on me in the bath.

171
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,326
[ROXY sighs]

172
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,328
[ROXY]
You seem so distant now.

173
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,790
I still have my hands
full with this "prince."

174
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,793
[ROXY]
Now, let's get down to business.

175
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,671
You want to learn the
Demon‐God language, yes?

176
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,090
There are very few books
written in Demon‐God,

177
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,759
and its grammar is
unique and challenging.

178
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,095
But if anyone can
learn it, you can.

179
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,556
So, I've created
this textbook for you.

180
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,016
I wrote it by hand.

181
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,728
It took me a long time, so I
hope you take good care of it.

182
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,982
[ROXY] If I ever see it in
a bookshop, I might cry.

183
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,444
[ROXY] By the way.
His Highness recently bought

184
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,614
a statuette that looks
just like me.

185
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,365
Its robe is removable,

186
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,368
and it even has moles
in the right places.

187
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,495
It's pretty creepy.

188
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,123
Maybe this means
I'm going to be cursed.

189
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,875
I'm uneasy.

190
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:53,504
But as long as it seems safe,
I'll write again soon. Roxy.

191
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,174
[RUDEUS]
I didn't think my figurine

192
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,509
would make its way
to the subject.

193
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,137
The prince of Shirone
has good taste.

194
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,140
[RUDEUS]
Handwritten, huh?

195
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,312
[RUDEUS]
Wow.

196
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,315
She did all this for me?

197
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,067
I can't thank her enough.

198
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,443
If I ever get to see her again,

199
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,279
I'll have to kiss
her feet or something.

200
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,406
Guess it's time to get to work.

201
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,296
[EDNA] At this rate,
I think you'll manage to

202
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,215
scrape by tomorrow
without incident.

203
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,424
[ERIS]
Seriously?

204
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,885
Yes. If you perform
as you have in practice

205
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,763
with Master Rudeus,
you'll be just fine.

206
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,015
[RUDEUS] But I won't be
her partner tomorrow.

207
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,142
Do you think that'll
be a problem?

208
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,561
Well. In any case,

209
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,648
remember what we worked on
today and do your best.

210
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,109
I got this!

211
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,819
[RUDEUS]
I doubt it.

212
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,506
Pardon me, do you have
any rice by chance?

213
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,425
No, of course you don't,
disregard that.

214
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,594
[SAUROS] Welcome, ladies
and gentlemen, welcome!

215
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,890
Thank you for joining
us in celebration

216
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,809
of Eris's tenth birthday!

217
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,228
For the occasion,
I've prepared delicacies from

218
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,439
every corner of
the Asura Kingdom!

219
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,942
Please enjoy
yourselves thoroughly!

220
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,360
Wow.

221
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,910
Happy birthday, My Lady.
It's an honor to be here.

222
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,912
Thank you very much.

223
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,874
[RUDEUS]
Can she handle this?

224
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,626
She won't try to punch
any of them, will she?

225
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,295
[EDNA]
Master Rudeus.

226
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,048
Good day to you, Miss Edna.
It's nice to see you.

227
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,426
Do you suppose Lady Eris
can muddle through without us?

228
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:07,180
We did everything we could,
so we'll have to wait and see.

229
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,265
[SAUROS]
Now. Your attention, please,

230
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,434
it's time for the main event!

231
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,770
If you wish for the favor
of the Boreas House,

232
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,564
then take my
granddaughter's hand!

233
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:29,702
May I have this
dance, Lady Eris?

234
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,120
Okay.

235
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,389
[YOUNG NOBLEMAN 07A]
My Lady, slow down a bit.

236
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,265
You're getting ahead of me.

237
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,272
What's wrong, Eris?
On your feet!

238
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,025
Don't tell me you can't dance!

239
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,152
That hurt!

240
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,199
[NOBLE 07A] I see the girl's
as oafish as ever.

241
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,202
[NOBLEWOMAN 07A] I had heard
she was making progress, but...

242
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,955
[NOBLE 07C] She can't even
perform a simple dance?

243
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,706
Pathetic.

244
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,961
Oh, Lady Eris.

245
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,672
[NOBLE 07A]
The Boreas family is doomed.

246
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,557
[RUDEUS]
May I have this dance, My Lady?

247
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,891
[ERIS gasps]

248
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,020
[inhales, exhales]

249
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,985
Whose boy is that?

250
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,194
[NOBLE 07C]
Where's he from?

251
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,239
What could you
possibly be thinking?

252
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,077
You ready?
Pretend it's practice.

253
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,620
Yeah, I can do that.

254
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,373
Deep breath, now. [inhales]

255
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,916
[inhales]

256
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,676
[BOTH gasp]

257
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,178
[gasps]

258
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:14,474
Hey, are you okay?
Why are you so nervous?

259
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:18,060
[ERIS] Grandfather and
my parents are watching me.

260
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,687
Eris.

261
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,487
[RUDEUS]
She's memorized the steps,

262
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,114
but she's getting ahead
of me without realizing it.

263
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,741
In which case...

264
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,951
Eris, close your eyes.

265
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,745
Huh?

266
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,956
I have a trick that'll
make you a better dancer.

267
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,500
[ERIS]
There's a spell for that?

268
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,794
Oh, it's not a spell,
just a trick.

269
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,421
Treat it like swordplay.

270
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,340
When I give you a signal,
perform the next step

271
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,716
like you're dodging an attack.

272
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,801
‐‐W‐Wait, are you sure?
‐‐[RUDEUS] Okay. On your mark.

273
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,762
Get set. Here we go!

274
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,555
Now!

275
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,765
Now!

276
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,144
[RUDEUS]
Now! Now!

277
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,312
And now!

278
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,855
How did he?

279
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,450
[RUDEUS]
See that? You're doing great.

280
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,331
Now let's do it one
more time just like that.

281
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,830
Yes! That's Greyrat
blood for you!

282
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:05,793
Well done, both of you! [laughs]

283
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,133
[EDNA] Master Rudeus, how in
the world did you do that?

284
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,884
I got her to think of it
like feint training,

285
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,012
and she picked up
on it immediately.

286
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,471
What do you mean?

287
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,391
The problem wasn't that
Eris couldn't sense the rhythm.

288
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,602
She instinctively outpaced it.

289
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,730
So, when she delayed her timing
to avoid falling for a feint,

290
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,773
her steps lined up perfectly.

291
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,109
My! Who would have
thought that swordplay

292
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,236
and dance could be
so intertwined?

293
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:36,365
Rudeus did!
He's totally amazing!

294
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,700
Give yourself more credit,

295
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:41,203
you got it because
you work hard in practice.

296
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,122
[YOUNG LADIES]
Lord Rudeus!

297
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,248
Will you dance with me?

298
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,458
How old are you?

299
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,959
Uh...

300
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,294
[PHILIP]
Rudeus.

301
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:51,297
I would prefer that you
not stand out too much.

302
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,759
But it's a special day,
so I suppose I'll allow it.

303
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,470
Just don't get anyone
pregnant, understand?

304
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,679
[RUDEUS]
Huh?

305
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,896
[RUDEUS gasping]

306
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,608
[RUDEUS]
I have something for you.

307
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,859
What are those for?

308
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,153
According to my master,
teachers should make wands

309
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,197
for students who master
Elementary magic,

310
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,948
but it took me
a while to figure out,

311
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,617
so I hope you'll forgive
that they're late.

312
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:23,788
Really? I'd rather have
one of those things!

313
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,958
Thank you, Master Rudeus.
I humbly accept this gift.

314
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,127
[RUDEUS]
It's an honor to teach you.

315
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,342
So, uh. Are you sure
you'd rather have a figurine?

316
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,930
[ERIS]
I decided I want a wand, too!

317
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,769
Uh. I humbly accept.

318
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,772
Good. I know you'll use it well.

319
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,025
[GHISLAINE]
What?

320
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:56,529
I think she expects
a present from you, too.

321
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,780
Oh.

322
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,620
This ring is a talisman
passed down by my people.

323
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,539
The story goes,
as long as you wear it,

324
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,999
wolves won't
attack you at night.

325
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,501
Wow. Are you sure?

326
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,504
Yeah. It was just
a superstition.

327
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:18,926
[gasps] I'll treasure it always!

328
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,847
[RUDEUS] Hey. How does a ring
beat a literal magic wand?

329
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,474
Ah, well. Girls and
their jewelry.

330
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,853
So, the wolf thing.
How do you know it's a myth?

331
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,690
[GHISLAINE] Ah. I had trouble
sleeping one night.

332
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,400
Paul invited me to
go for a swim, and‐‐

333
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,277
[RUDEUS]
You know what, never mind.

334
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,486
[GHISLAINE]
Okay.

335
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:56,589
[RUDEUS] Wow. Well, nothing
ventured, nothing gained.

336
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,966
Let's play a little trick.

337
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,349
[RUDEUS] I guess that ring
works after all, hm?

338
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,564
[yawns]

339
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,115
[BEAST MAID 07A moaning]

340
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:26,368
[RUDEUS] Kinda early to
shaboink in public, innit?

341
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,996
[SAUROS sighs]

342
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,707
[RUDEUS gasps]

343
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,417
[SAUROS]
Rudeus.

344
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,468
[RUDEUS]
My apologies, Lord Sauros.

345
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,845
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

346
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,724
[SAUROS] No matter.
Look out there, Rudeus.

347
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,353
[RUDEUS] He seems different.
Did sex mellow him out?

348
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,980
[RUDEUS]
What is that?

349
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,524
[SAUROS]
I don't know.

350
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,360
But I don't think
it's a bad thing.

351
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,904
What makes you so sure, My Lord?

352
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,865
[SAUROS]
It's less worrisome that way.

353
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,534
I suppose.

354
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,623
[RUDEUS]
Then I'll say a prayer, too.

355
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,960
May women rain down
from the sky.
