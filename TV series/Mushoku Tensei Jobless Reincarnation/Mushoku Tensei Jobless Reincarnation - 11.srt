Dear Rudeus.

14
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,413
Zenith, Lilia, and Aisha
are all missing.

15
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,665
Norn is safe with me.

16
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,459
I don't know where you are,
or who you're with,

17
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,753
but I know you can
find your way home,

18
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,089
even if you're traveling alone.

19
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:33,051
So I'm going to look
for you last, my son.

20
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,887
I'm headed to the
Millis Continent.

21
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,015
It's where your mother
was born and raised,

22
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,975
and her family is still there.

23
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:43,353
I've sent a message
to Lilia's family as well.

24
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,855
I want you to search
the northern part

of the Central Continent.

find any of them.

please do the same.

28
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,907

who knows my family,

29

and to former members of
The Fangs of the Black Wolf:

00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,372
I need your help.

I'm sure some of you
don't think too highly of me.

I won't beg for
your forgiveness.

You can insult me all you want.

If you ask me to lick
your boots, I'll do it.

My fortune's gone,

so I can't offer
a reward, but please.

Our job is to investigate

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,043
a mysterious monster
in the Petrified Forest.

46
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,671
We get five scrap‐iron
pieces for finding it,

47
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,923
and two iron pieces
if we slay it.

What kind of monster is it?

50

but that's all we know.

Yeah, if I had to guess.

Awesome, I can't
wait to meet it!

[RUDEUS] Whatever it is,
I'm sure we can take it.

00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,899
And then we can kiss
our financial woes

It looks like we're all here

Wait. I'm worried
about those children.

We should follow them.

I dunno, if we stick
too close to them,

they might figure out
you really are a Superd.

You realize it'll be a
disaster if word gets out?

Would you rather I stand back
and watch them die?

That's not what I'm saying.

00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,324
We can tail them,
but we shouldn't jump in

Please don't kill him!

163
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,875
[RUDEUS gasps]
Where are you going?!

164
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,465
[RUDEUS]
Ruijerd!

165
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,634
[ERIS]
Ruijerd!

166
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,303
‐‐Where are you?
‐‐Come on, where'd you go?

167
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,826
[RUDEUS] Will you please
say something?

168
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,245
[RUIJERD]
Sorry.

169
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:03,666
[RUDEUS] For what? I should
be apologizing to you.

170
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:08,087
I was too focused on
finding the easy way out.

171
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:11,882
I just wanted to make money
and make us look good.

172
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:16,220
I'm sorry. I've been acting
like a selfish idiot.

173
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,346
No you haven't.

174
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:21,183
Even the best‐laid battle plans
can go awry sometimes.

175
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,477
It's not your fault.

176
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,479
I didn't always
understand your motives

177
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,357
or abide by your decisions.

178
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:32,153
But now, I see that
I misjudged you.

179
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,990
In town, you were prepared
to kill to survive.

180
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,117
I could sense your resolve.

181
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,460
There's no shame
in being desperate

182
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,712
to try to protect something.

183
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,800
[ERIS]
Hm?

184
00:18:56,761 --> 00:19:00,723
You've proven yourself
to be a fine warrior, Rudeus.

185
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,309
But I've treated you
like a child.

186
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,230
What does that word
even mean to you, Ruijerd?

187
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,815
"Warrior."

188
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:15,112
Being a warrior is
a matter of pride.

189
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:19,659
We fight to defend the weak
as well as our comrades.

190
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,577
That's in my blood.

191
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,579
I will stay at your side.

192
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:26,415
And you owe me nothing
in return for that.

193
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,336
So, don't worry about
the Superd's reputation.

194
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:33,881
Protect what you must,
no matter the cost.

195
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,424
No matter...

196
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,763
I will. Thank you
for everything.

197
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,683
[RUDEUS]
But I will restore your name

198
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,143
if it's the last thing I do.

199
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,854
Did you listen to
anything I said?

200
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,399
Am I that untrustworthy to you?

201
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,778
Of course not, I want to
repay you because I trust you.

202
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,030
You're certainly
a stubborn one.

203
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,700
Yeah, I think I
picked that up from you.

204
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:04,328
[BOTH chuckling]

205
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:09,458
[BOTH laughing]

206
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,212
Well?

207
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,299
Yeah.

208
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:27,226
[RUDEUS] I'm no warrior.
Never have been.

209
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,687
And to be honest,
I'm not sure I'll ever have

210
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,815
the sense of pride
Ruijerd does, either.

211
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,900
But in that moment,

212
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:39,613
his approval of me
made me feel... happy.

213
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,698
Like an equal.

214
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,949
[ERIS]
I'll take care of both of you!

215
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:48,873
[ALL laughing]

216
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,761
Wh‐What did you do to your head?

217
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,345
I shaved it.

218
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,847
What happened yesterday
made it clear that

219
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,808
my hair frightens people
above all else.

220
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,604
‐‐I see.
‐‐That's a great look for you!

221
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,855
[RUDEUS]
Really?

222
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,482
Oh! Hang on a sec!

223
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,691
Uh‐‐

224
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,778
[RUDEUS]
Coulda sworn it was... Got it!

225
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,154
[BOTH]
Hm?

226
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,868
[RUDEUS] Might as well hide your
third eye while we're at it.

227
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,956
[ERIS]
Hey, look! Now we match!

228
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,210
Yes.

229
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,796
[RUDEUS]
Up to this point,

230
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,007
I've been desperate to figure
out everything on my own.

231
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:44,887
I was too controlling, and that
contributed to my failures.

232
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,431
We'll run into all sorts
of problems down the road.

233
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,725
So I'd like for us to
talk them out together

234
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,936
and find solutions as a group.

235
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,689
Fewer surprises that way,
and hopefully, fewer fights.

236
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,358
Sound good?

237
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,734
Aye.

238
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,236
Works for me!

239
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,737
All right, then, team.

240
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,364
I hereby call the first‐ever

241
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,242
Dead End strategy
meeting to order.

242
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:09,328
Destination, the Asura Kingdom!
