Huh? You okay, Momma?

[LILIA gasping]

[gasps] Aisha, love,
are you awake? Aisha!

[coughs]

9
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:38,046
That's strange, those are front
gates of the Shirone capitol.

10
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:40,131
How did we get here?

00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:49,808
[NOBLEWOMAN 20A screams]

12
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:51,142
[SOLDIER 19A]
State your business.

13
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:53,061
I beg your pardon,
but I believe a woman

14
00:01:53,144 --> 00:01:55,814
named Roxy Migurdia
lives in this castle.

15
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:58,274
May I request an
audience with her?

16
00:01:58,358 --> 00:02:00,026
What a suspicious request.
Who are you?

17
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:05,156
Hold it! First, tell me
how you know my Roxy.

18
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:37,355
[RUDEUS] Hi. I'm Rudeus,
a former jobless bum.

19
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,734
Today we're checking out
a free apartment in Shirone.

20
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:44,279
That's right: no deposit,
no fees, no rent.

21
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:45,989
You may not think it
looks like much,

22
00:02:46,072 --> 00:02:47,615
and you'd be right!

23
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,409
There's no bed,
and the lack of toilet

24
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:51,494
means whatever material
your pants are made of,

25
00:02:51,578 --> 00:02:53,079
they're gonna be
getting a workout,

26
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:56,332
but you just can't
beat this price.

27
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,169
And get a load of
this reassuring security!

28
00:02:59,252 --> 00:03:01,671
Once you're inside,
all magic is nullified,

29
00:03:01,755 --> 00:03:04,549
and it's impossible to leave!

30
00:03:04,632 --> 00:03:07,886
[sighs] Ya know, I think
once was prob'ly enough

31
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:09,846
for that particular bit.

32
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:12,474
[RUDEUS]
Ruijerd! Eris!

33
00:03:12,557 --> 00:03:15,810
Hurry up and rescue me already!
I'm begging you!

34
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:37,791
I am Zanoba, third prince
of Shirone Kingdom.

35
00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:40,627
Please state your name
for me, young traveler.

36
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:43,880
My name is Rudeus Greyrat.

37
00:03:43,963 --> 00:03:45,965
It's a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

38
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:47,384
Indeed.

39
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:50,220
May I ask what brings you
here today, Your Highness?

40
00:03:51,429 --> 00:03:54,307
[ZANOBA] Where did you
get this demon figure?

41
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:56,226
Well? Ginger tells me it was in

42
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:58,770
the pack she
confiscated from you.

43
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:01,272
[RUDEUS] How am I
supposed to answer this?

44
00:04:01,356 --> 00:04:04,317
What if it's considered
a false idol in this kingdom?

45
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:07,696
I just stumbled on it
while I was traveling.

46
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:09,364
I picked it up on
the Demon Continent.

47
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:12,659
Aha! I knew this had to have
been crafted by a demon!

48
00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:14,202
Now, where exactly
did you acquire it

49
00:04:14,285 --> 00:04:15,662
and who sold it to you?

50
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:17,414
Do you know who the artist is?

51
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:18,873
I do not.

52
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:20,834
I just saw it and I liked it,
so I bought it,

53
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:24,295
but I didn't ask for any
specific details or anything.

54
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:28,466
Oh, well. If that's the case.

55
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:42,480
[ZANOBA] Do you, perchance,
recognize this figurine?

56
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:43,773
[gasps]

57
00:04:43,857 --> 00:04:46,484
[RUDEUS] That's the Roxy figure
I made ages ago.

58
00:04:46,568 --> 00:04:48,862
This one was discovered
at a traveling merchant's stall

59
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:51,114
in the marketplace
several years ago.

60
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:53,825
My brother noticed it bore a
striking resemblance to Roxy,

61
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:55,910
our then court mage,
and bought it at once,

62
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:59,372
but he's far too unrefined
to appreciate its true value.

63
00:04:59,456 --> 00:05:01,249
Hold on. Did you say Roxy was

64
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:03,877
your then court mage,
like, not now?

65
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,545
[ZANOBA]
Hm? That's correct.

66
00:05:05,628 --> 00:05:07,339
My brother's constant
sexual harassment

67
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:09,466
finally exceeded
her tolerance, so she left.

68
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:10,884
--Huh?
--But enough about her,

69
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:14,763
focus on this figurine
a moment! Focus.

70
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:16,765
At first glance, it appears
to simply depict

71
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:19,142
a magician
brandishing her staff.

72
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:21,353
But the sense of
movement is incredible.

73
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:23,980
The folds of the fabric,
her billowing robe.

74
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:25,857
The way she steps out
with one leg,

75
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,776
staff thrust out
in fierce defiance!

76
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:30,403
An incredibly vivid moment.

77
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:32,322
And while most of her
body remains covered,

78
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:34,240
the ever-so-slight
exposure of her skin

79
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:36,409
exudes a faint eroticism.

80
00:05:36,493 --> 00:05:38,745
She's clearly quite lithe,
dare I say scrawny,

81
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:40,872
but enticing nonetheless.

82
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:43,291
Now, observe it from the rear!

83
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,669
A robe like this would normally
obscure anyone's figure,

84
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:47,337
but her outstretched
leg pulls the fabric

85
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,421
just tight enough to reveal

86
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:50,799
the faintest outline
of her buttocks!

87
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:53,259
This expert presentation
makes one long to see more.

88
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:54,594
And as if in answer.

89
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:57,555
Behold! Her robe is detachable.

90
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,890
I was shocked to discover that

91
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:00,850
it comes away in
two pieces to reveal

92
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:04,020
her innocent frame in
naught but her skivvies!

93
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:06,356
But that's not all:
you'll notice her left hand

94
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:09,025
is now covering her chest!

95
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:10,527
"How odd," you may think.

96
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,488
"Wasn't she grasping her
staff mere moments ago?"

97
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:15,782
But if you examine the pieces
of her robe you've pulled away,

98
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:18,993
you'll see that arm
detached with it!

99
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:23,081
Yes! Yes! This figurine
has three arms!

100
00:06:23,164 --> 00:06:25,375
With this little gimmick,
two separate figurines,

101
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,253
one robed, one in her underwear,
are rolled into one!

102
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:30,755
Genius! Truly magnificent!

103
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,133
This is an object of most
exquisite quality and nuance,

104
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:34,634
reaching heights
far beyond what crude

105
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:37,512
dwarven carvings could
ever hope to achieve!

106
00:06:37,595 --> 00:06:41,808
[RUDEUS chuckles] Wow.
He spotted every minute detail!

107
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:43,435
You, sir,
have singlehandedly made

108
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:45,937
all that hard work worthwhile.

109
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:50,150
Wait a sec. The mole
under her armpit is missing.

110
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:54,279
Huh? Ah, yes, there used to be
a dark spot near her hand.

111
00:06:54,362 --> 00:06:56,364
But I felt it detracted
from the figurine's beauty,

112
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:57,782
so I shaved it down.

113
00:06:57,866 --> 00:07:02,078
[gasps] You. You did what?

114
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:06,374
[RUDEUS] I want you to
take another look at her.

115
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,709
Huh?

116
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:13,631
[RUDEUS] Do you see that
her hand doesn't quite reach?

117
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:17,969
[gasps]

118
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:20,388
[RUDEUS] Do you see now
why she's posed to

119
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:23,808
hide her chest but not her mole?

120
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:28,229
It can't be. It's impossible.

121
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:29,314
[RUDEUS]
That mole was supposed to be

122
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:31,775
the sexiest aspect
of the design.

123
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:33,777
When her nipples are hidden,
it stands out,

124
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,322
and her embarrassment stems from
not being able to hide both.

125
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:39,324
I... I'm ashamed to admit

126
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:41,284
I've been blind
for this entire time.

127
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:42,369
And in my ignorance,

128
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:45,246
I have defiled
a flawless work of art.

129
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,878
If it's really gonna
bother you that much,

130
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:53,088
I could always just put it back.

131
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:55,548
[ZANOBA gasps]
Then you are the artist

132
00:07:55,632 --> 00:07:57,050
who created this figurine!

133
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,260
Of course it was a student
of the Water King!

134
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:01,179
I study your creation every day!

135
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:03,515
With each viewing, my respect
for you only grows stronger!

136
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,267
Please allow me to pay my
respects to your godlike hands!

137
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:08,019
No, allow me to call you Master!

138
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:10,522
I'll do anything
you ask! In fact!

139
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:11,606
As I grovel at your feet,

140
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,234
I shall seal my loyalty
with a kiss--

141
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:17,862
[ZANOBA gasps]
Why is this barrier here?

142
00:08:17,946 --> 00:08:19,948
Who dares keep me from you?

143
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:24,285
What is the meaning
of this? [screams]

144
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:25,954
[RUDEUS] He's starting
to remind me of those

145
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:27,414
mouth-breathing fanatics who

146
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:30,667
swarm conventions
for new releases.

147
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,629
Master!

148
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:41,386
[knocking]

149
00:08:42,846 --> 00:08:44,681
[SOLDIER 19B]
Dark clouds hang low.

150
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:47,267
[SOLDIER 19A]
Indeed, the storm is near.

151
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:54,399
[SOLDIER 19B]
We can't thank you enough for

152
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:56,526
assisting us on
such short notice.

153
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:57,944
[ERIS]
All that stuff can wait!

154
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:02,741
I wanna know where Ru--
where the Kennel Master is now!

155
00:09:02,824 --> 00:09:06,077
Y-Yes, of course,
the "Kennel Master."

156
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:08,705
He's currently imprisoned
in the palace dungeons.

157
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:11,124
[ERIS] Huh? Screw this,
I'm going to rescue him!

158
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:12,208
[SOLDIER 19B]
Please wait!

159
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:14,753
We need to make
a request of you first!

160
00:09:14,836 --> 00:09:16,254
[ERIS]
You're kidding, right?

161
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:19,007
He'll be fine down
there on his own, okay?

162
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,717
Ha.

163
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,636
Now then, what is it
that you want from us?

164
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,017
[gasps] If you will, we need
your help rescuing our families.

165
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:33,271
I thought we'd be
assaulting a castle.

166
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,231
Explain yourselves.

167
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:38,360
In a vie for more power,

168
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:41,154
Prince Pax has taken
our families hostage.

169
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:43,198
Huh? Why would he do that?

170
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:46,201
Oh! 'Cause he wants a bigger
imperial guard, right?

171
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:48,370
So he's controlling soldiers
in the palace garrison

172
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:49,996
by hurting their families.

173
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,957
He's not exactly quiet about it.

174
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,417
We still haven't
given up hope of

175
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:56,961
setting things right
and restoring order,

176
00:09:57,045 --> 00:09:59,798
but you see why
we can't act openly.

177
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:01,758
Our hands have been tied.

178
00:10:04,219 --> 00:10:08,056
[SOLDIER 19B] So. Please!
Lend us your aid!

179
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:11,893
[ERIS]
Well, all right!

180
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:14,437
If that's how it is,
just leave it to us!

181
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:20,402
Or to me. You should
stay here, Eris.

182
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:21,820
Why should I?

183
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:24,989
It's far too dangerous
to take Aisha with us.

184
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:28,827
It sounds scary.

185
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,080
[RUIJERD] Staying behind to
guard her is a vital duty.

186
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:38,837
I hear ya. We'll be right
here until you get back.

187
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:45,510
[SOLDIER 19B]
I'll guide you!

188
00:10:45,593 --> 00:10:48,930
No need for that.
I've already found them.

189
00:10:53,476 --> 00:10:57,272
[ZANOBA] Where is it, where is
it, where is it, where is it?

190
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:59,482
I simply can't find
the mechanism anywhere!

191
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:00,942
[RUDEUS]
Are any of you subordinates

192
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:03,194
barrier experts, by chance?

193
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:05,196
I don't have any subordinates.

194
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,406
Ginger was my last guard,

195
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:08,908
but I traded her to Pax
for the Roxy figure.

196
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:11,286
What a fantastic
bargain that was!

197
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:14,205
[RUDEUS]
Ah. So he's a moron, too.

198
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:17,000
Well, I guess I'm gonna
stay trapped in here forever.

199
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,335
Now I'll never
teach you what I know.

200
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:22,714
You what? No!

201
00:11:22,797 --> 00:11:26,343
[ZANOBA cries]
What a calamity!

202
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:28,511
Hey, as long as
you can find someone

203
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:29,679
who can get me out of here,

204
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:31,348
I'll gladly take you on
as my apprentice.

205
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:36,102
Really? You mean I don't
have to do it myself? Very well!

206
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:42,859
[ZANOBA]
In other words, Master.

207
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:45,278
I merely have to do
something about Pax?

208
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:48,156
[RUDEUS]
Huh? Uh, yeah, I guess so.

209
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,616
Understood, sir.

210
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:51,534
I promise I won't
keep you waiting long.

211
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:53,536
[gasps] Well, don't leave yet!

212
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,205
I really think we oughtta
talk about this first!

213
00:11:55,288 --> 00:11:56,873
What's your plan--?

214
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:00,460
Or just walk off,
that's fine, too.

215
00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:07,676
What's all that about?

216
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,846
[SOLDIER 19B] Dammit! Why now?
Get up here! It's an emergency!

217
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,014
[ERIS]
Huh?

218
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:14,724
There's a madman in the castle.

219
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:15,975
That spikey equipment is used to

220
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:18,978
restrain him when
he loses control.

221
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:21,106
He's what's known
as a "Blessed Child."

222
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:24,275
Blessed Children are born with
some kind of unique ability,

223
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:26,611
like teleportation
or fire-breathing.

224
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:29,239
This one possesses
incredible physical strength,

225
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:32,617
so he's considered a highly
useful military power.

226
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:35,036
So, the kingdom handles
him with great care

227
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,664
and values him highly
no matter what he does.

228
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:41,209
When he was three, he tore his
own baby brother's head off.

229
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:45,005
Now, he decapitates
anyone who displeases him.

230
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:48,341
[ERIS] Wow. I didn't know
anyone was that strong!

231
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:51,136
I wanna fight a guy
like that someday.

232
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:54,806
[PAX screams]

233
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:00,478
[SOLDIER 20A]
Prince Zanoba!

234
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:02,272
Prince Zanoba,
stand down at once!

235
00:13:02,355 --> 00:13:03,648
Please, sir!

236
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:08,403
[PAX]
Stop! Stop it! Zanoba!

237
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:09,779
Who is that guy?

238
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:12,699
[AISHA gasps] That's the man
I was telling you about.

239
00:13:12,782 --> 00:13:15,869
Zanoba Shirone,
the Decapitator Prince!

240
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:19,080
[AISHA]
Miss?

241
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:21,374
Zanoba, stop!
Put me down at once, you fool!

242
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,501
Well, Master? What do you think?

243
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:26,004
Will you officially make me
your apprentice now?

244
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:28,465
Prince Zanoba, unhand your
brother this instant!

245
00:13:28,548 --> 00:13:32,761
[PAX] Zanoba! Let go!
You'll split my skull!

246
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:34,346
[ZANOBA]
Hush, Pax.

247
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:36,389
[PAX screams]

248
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:37,682
[ZANOBA]
If you wish to save yourself,

249
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:39,642
you can release Master Rudeus.

250
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:41,102
[PAX]
No! Never!

251
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:43,980
I need him as bait to lure
Roxy back h-- [screams]

252
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:45,440
That hurts!

253
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:47,192
Please, Prince!

254
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:49,069
[PAX]
Oh! Ginger! Save me!

255
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:51,780
Think about your family!
I'll git 'em! I swear!

256
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:53,156
[PAX screams]

257
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:54,449
Oh, don't listen to that crap,

258
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:56,242
your families are
gonna be just fine.

259
00:13:56,326 --> 00:13:58,286
Ruijerd's out
rescuing them right now.

260
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,914
And Ruijerd is who?

261
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:02,332
[ERIS]
He's a good friend of ours!

262
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:04,918
He's really nice and
super strong. He's a Superd!

263
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:06,419
[SOLDIERS gasp]

264
00:14:06,503 --> 00:14:07,962
You can't be serious!

265
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:10,965
We've enlisted the help
of a Superd warrior?

266
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:22,936
[PAX]
Ginger! What are you doing?

267
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,229
Take that back out!

268
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:26,189
Forgive me,
but I originally swore

269
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:28,608
my loyalty to Prince Zanoba,

270
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:31,152
therefore I cannot
defy His Highness's will.

271
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:32,696
Wait, that's not
how that works, is it?

272
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:36,282
[ZANOBA] Pax, do you
intend to keep me waiting?

273
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:37,534
Don't forget I could
rip your head

274
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:40,870
from your shoulders
at any moment.

275
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:51,923
[ZANOBA chuckling]

276
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:55,885
[PAX groaning]

277
00:15:05,812 --> 00:15:07,981
[PAX shrieks] Fine, you win,
I'll do whatever you want,

278
00:15:08,064 --> 00:15:11,443
just let go of me, brother,
I'm begging you, please!

279
00:15:11,526 --> 00:15:13,486
[ZANOBA]
Ah! Splendid.

280
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,490
But let's make absolutely sure
you've learned your lesson, hm?

281
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:23,705
[screams] My arm! My arm!

282
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,792
Goodness me.

283
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:31,129
Regular humans are such
fragile creatures, aren't they?

284
00:15:31,212 --> 00:15:34,174
[PAX] It's not
supposed to bend that way!

285
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:37,093
[RUDEUS]
Wait. So we're square now?

286
00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:39,471
Was Ginger on my side
the whole time?

287
00:15:39,554 --> 00:15:41,556
I'm totally lost.

288
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:55,779
[RUDEUS]
This incident kicked off when

289
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:58,865
I rescued Aisha the other day.

290
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:01,117
My silent spellcasting
clued the soldiers in

291
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:03,536
to the fact that I was
Roxy's student.

292
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,663
Originally, they intended
to explain things to me

293
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:08,166
and ask for my help
with their families.

294
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:09,709
But that plan hit a snag when I

295
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:12,212
wrote to the castle too soon
and got locked up.

296
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:15,215
They were my
"acquaintances," not Roxy.

297
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:18,385
I guess Ginger was working
behind the scenes, too.

298
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:20,011
She must have given
Zanoba that figure

299
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:22,681
because she knew
he'd come ask about it.

300
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:24,432
But if that's the case,
I wonder why she didn't

301
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,935
warn me about any
of this when we met.

302
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:30,230
I could've handled everything
way better if she had.

303
00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:32,524
Now I kinda feel left out.

304
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:35,568
[RUDEUS]
Although.

305
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:39,030
Guess you can't be too careful
when your family's in danger.

306
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,583
Master! You're free!

307
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:54,129
[RUDEUS screams]

308
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:57,382
[ZANOBA gasps] Ginger!
Cast a healing spell at once!

309
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:58,800
[GINGER]
Sir!

310
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:00,343
[RUDEUS]
I'm starting to second-guess

311
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:02,262
that apprenticeship.

312
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:10,562
[ERIS]
Oh, yeah! Rude--

313
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:12,772
I mean, the Kennel
Master's amazing!

314
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:14,733
Tell me about
your other adventures!

315
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:17,277
[ERIS giggles]
You got it!

316
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:23,366
And that's it.

317
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:26,578
[LILIA]
Master Rudeus.

318
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:31,207
[LILIA]
This is for you.

319
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,626
Is this what I think it is?

320
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:39,466
Thank you very much, Lilia.

321
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:41,384
I know those meant
a great deal to you,

322
00:17:41,468 --> 00:17:43,386
so I've kept them safe
all these years.

323
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,806
And I'm pleased to finally have
the occasion to return them.

324
00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:51,394
[RUDEUS]
What is this?

325
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:54,564
[LILIA] It was intended as
a gift for your tenth birthday.

326
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:55,940
Young Miss
Sylphiette hand-carved

327
00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:57,567
that pendant just for you.

328
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:01,029
[RUDEUS gasps]
Sylphie.

329
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,876
Happy birthday. From all of us.

330
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:17,379
I'm sorry we missed it.

331
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:20,215
U-Uh-- Hey, um, Lilia.

332
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,175
You're touching me.

333
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:24,594
How crass.

334
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:25,804
It's good to see that

335
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:28,348
you haven't changed
a bit, Master Rudeus.

336
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,726
[LILIA]
I'm so glad that you're safe.

337
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,566
I'm glad that you and
Aisha are safe, too.

338
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,151
Aisha hasn't said anything rude

339
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:42,862
or disrespectful to you
at all, has she?

340
00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:44,531
[RUDEUS]
Of course not.

341
00:18:44,614 --> 00:18:46,700
She's a brilliant girl.

342
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:48,702
You're raising her well.

343
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:50,203
On the contrary.

344
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:53,206
She hasn't yet lived up to
your more incredible qualities.

345
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:55,834
She comparatively dull.

346
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:58,420
That's a little harsh,
don't you think?

347
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:00,380
[LILIA gasps]

348
00:19:00,463 --> 00:19:03,425
[AISHA]
Mister Kennel Master!

349
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:06,261
Kennel Master! I have
a favor I wanna ask you!

350
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:07,470
But only in private!

351
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:09,264
Sure thing, what do you need?

352
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:10,390
I'll help however I can.

353
00:19:10,473 --> 00:19:13,018
[gasps] Then, please!

354
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:15,895
Allow me to accompany you
on your journey!

355
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:18,982
Excuse me?

356
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:20,525
[AISHA] My mother talks
all the time about

357
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:22,193
how I'm supposed to
serve my half-brother

358
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:25,030
someday in the future. Only I...

359
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:25,947
Only you?

360
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,115
I don't wanna!

361
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:28,658
Save me from his
perverted clutches,

362
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:31,077
as bravely as you did
the other day!

363
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:35,206
Oh, please say yes!

364
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,042
My mother says I'm gonna
do a lot of growing,

365
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,335
and one day I'll have a body

366
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:41,004
that'll make boys
wanna make babies!

367
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:45,216
[RUDEUS] Lilia, what the hell
have you been teaching her?

368
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,634
[AISHA gasps]

369
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,429
Children shouldn't talk
about making babies.

370
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:03,985
[gasps]

371
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,155
I want you to have this, okay?

372
00:20:08,114 --> 00:20:09,407
Like, to keep?

373
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:11,910
I can't take you
with me, but this way,

374
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:14,120
I can leave part of
myself with you.

375
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:15,413
Having a memento from someone

376
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:17,832
important to you
can be reassuring.

377
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,878
And maybe your brother felt the
same way about his "memento."

378
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:27,425
[RUDEUS]
What do you think?

379
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:45,944
I get it! That makes
more sense now!

380
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:47,904
[RUDEUS giggles]

381
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,012
Bye, everyone!

382
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:15,432
We'll meet again someday!
That's a promise!

383
00:21:18,768 --> 00:21:20,603
And I'm sorry I
called you a pervert!

384
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:22,272
Hope you're not mad!

385
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:24,232
No, I'm not mad.

386
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:25,608
Huh?

387
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:42,250
Smart kid.

388
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,503
She saw right through you
from the start.

389
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:48,006
Yeah. How did she...?

390
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:06,941
[RUDEUS]
Addendum.

391
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,402
Pax and Zanoba were exiled
after that whole ordeal,

392
00:22:09,486 --> 00:22:11,321
but in the interest of
maintaining appearances,

393
00:22:11,404 --> 00:22:14,324
the kingdom claimed they were
simply "studying abroad."

394
00:22:14,407 --> 00:22:19,662
Master!
