1
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:28,643
[RUDEUS]
Ah, shit.

2
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:30,228
[MAN-GOD]
Language!

3
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:32,313
Good to see you
haven't changed a bit.

4
00:00:32,397 --> 00:00:34,524
[RUDEUS] I was this close
to forgetting about you.

5
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:37,444
[MAN-GOD] It's been a whole year
since our last chat.

6
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:39,487
But why the cold shoulder?

7
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:42,657
It's all thanks to me you got
that demon eye, you know!

8
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:43,908
[RUDEUS]
Yeah, sure.

9
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:45,869
But if you'd been
a little more specific.

10
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:47,495
I wouldn't have
wound up in prison,

11
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,707
missed Paul's message, or had
that stupid fight with him.

12
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,378
[laughs] Your adventures
never cease to entertain.

13
00:00:55,462 --> 00:00:56,963
But lemme ask you this.

14
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:59,924
You sure you wanna
blame me for everything?

15
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,428
[RUDEUS]
Dammit.

16
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:06,723
Every time you bring me here,
I go back to my old self.

17
00:01:06,806 --> 00:01:09,142
I swear I've
turned over a new leaf.

18
00:01:09,225 --> 00:01:11,561
I take responsibility now!

19
00:01:14,356 --> 00:01:15,899
All right, fine,
I'm ready to listen

20
00:01:15,982 --> 00:01:17,484
and I'm grateful
for your guidance!

21
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:20,153
I wouldn't be alive without you,
is that what you wanted to hear?

22
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:22,697
Now hurry up and spit out
your next piece of advice!

23
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:26,701
My goodness, you never just
come out and beg me for it!

24
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:28,995
[RUDEUS]
Nope. But this time.

25
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,540
I have a specific request:
Help me find my family.

26
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:34,000
Whatever do you mean?

27
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:36,378
I thought your family was
in a whole other world!

28
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:37,921
You know exactly what I mean.

29
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:41,383
Zenith, Lilia, and Aisha, okay?

30
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:42,759
And, if possible,
I want to know about

31
00:01:42,842 --> 00:01:45,804
Sylphie, Ghislaine,
Philip, and Sauros as well.

32
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:49,307
I dunno. Lemme think about it.

33
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:55,730
Aw, I'm only joking!
Tough crowd today.

34
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:59,150
But, before I tell you,
promise me one thing.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,444
We'll see.

36
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:03,321
If the next advice
I give you helps you

37
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:05,782
reunite with your
long-lost family,

38
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:08,118
I would like for you to
trust me from now on!

39
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:09,160
Whaddya say?

40
00:02:09,244 --> 00:02:10,412
What, and obey your
every command

41
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:12,455
like a little
yes-man marionette?

42
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:15,583
Oh, no. I won't ask
you to go that far.

43
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:17,043
I just mean it's gonna
get exhausting

44
00:02:17,127 --> 00:02:19,421
if you're this hostile every
time we talk, you know?

45
00:02:19,504 --> 00:02:20,839
For you, maybe,
but it's gonna be

46
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:22,632
exhausting for me either way.

47
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:25,719
Do you know how depressing
it is to be back in this body?

48
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:26,970
Every time you drag me here,

49
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:29,848
I feel like my
growth's been erased.

50
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:32,225
But I guess if you can
help me out this time,

51
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:34,894
I'll stop being so rude.

52
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,938
And you'll trust me, right?

53
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:41,609
That'll depend on
what happens next.

54
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:45,530
Okay! Guess that'll have to do.

55
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:50,994
[clears throat] Now, let's put
that demon eye to use.

56
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,415
[MAN-GOD] In a few weeks time,
you'll enter Shirone Kingdom.

57
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:58,001
Where you will stumble
upon this scene.

58
00:02:58,084 --> 00:02:59,336
The young lady being detained is

59
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:02,130
none other than your
sister, Aisha Greyrat.

60
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:04,049
Hang on. What'd you just say?

61
00:03:04,132 --> 00:03:06,468
[MAN-GOD] Rescue her,
but under no circumstances

62
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:08,178
should you tell her
your real name.

63
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:09,262
Use an alias.

64
00:03:09,346 --> 00:03:11,181
Ask about details
of her situation.

65
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:13,808
And then send a letter
to your acquaintance

66
00:03:13,892 --> 00:03:16,561
at the royal palace of Shirone.

67
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:18,646
Wait. Who do I know at--?

68
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,024
If you can do that,
then you shall succeed in

69
00:03:21,107 --> 00:03:23,234
rescuing both Aisha
and Lilia from

70
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:25,820
the tyrant at the
palace of Shirone!

71
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:28,531
Lilia, too, huh? But why?

72
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:31,368
If they're in Shirone, they
should have been found by now--

73
00:03:34,788 --> 00:03:38,833
[RUDEUS retching]

74
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:43,588
[RUIJERD]
What's wrong? Are you okay?

75
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:45,674
[RUDEUS]
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

76
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:49,302
Just some lingering
seasickness from earlier.

77
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,559
[RUDEUS] Did that freak lead me
to this eye just to show me

78
00:03:56,643 --> 00:03:59,104
the future whenever
the mood strikes?

79
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:04,359
[RUDEUS] I don't get it.
I feel like I'm being used.

80
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,802
I'm not getting on another boat
for the rest of my life.

81
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:03,626
[ERIS]
I didn't know what to expect,

82
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,087
but this "rice" stuff is
actually pretty tasty!

83
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:09,174
Give it a try, Rudeus,
what are you waiting for?

84
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:12,135
Well. Thank you for this meal.

85
00:05:57,764 --> 00:06:00,975
[ERIS]
Shirone's capital is so amazing!

86
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:05,814
[RUDEUS]
The Man-God told me to

87
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:09,275
write to "an acquaintance"
at the castle.

88
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:11,528
Meaning Roxy, I guess?

89
00:06:11,611 --> 00:06:15,323
Supposedly I can "save"
Lilia and Aisha that way,

90
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:16,616
but if they're here in the city,

91
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,620
Roxy should have
found them ages ago. Right?

92
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:23,707
Ooh, this is where your
master lives now, isn't it?

93
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,128
Hey. So what's with
the gloomy expression?

94
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:30,672
[RUDEUS]
Well. I heard from a source

95
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:32,132
that some members of my family

96
00:06:32,215 --> 00:06:35,093
may have been taken captive
somewhere in this kingdom.

97
00:06:35,176 --> 00:06:36,344
[ERIS]
Really?

98
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:38,346
[RUIJERD]
Oh. Your mother?

99
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,849
[RUDEUS]
No, Lilia and Aisha.

100
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,976
Our former maid
and my little sister.

101
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:44,561
[ERIS]
Your sister?

102
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:46,938
How'd she get carted all the way
here from Millishion so fast?

103
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:49,441
That was Norn, my other sister.

104
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:52,402
Uh-huh.

105
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:54,654
Anyway, if you're up for it,

106
00:06:54,738 --> 00:06:56,781
I'd really appreciate
any help you can give me

107
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:58,742
with gathering more
information about them.

108
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:00,201
Well, yeah.

109
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:02,579
If it's about your family,
then we don't have a choice.

110
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:06,541
[RUDEUS]
Thank you.

111
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:12,380
[RUDEUS] Thank god they didn't
ask who my source was.

112
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:14,215
Let's hope it stays that way.

113
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:16,926
I don't like keeping secrets.

114
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,139
But until I figure out what that
skinny, pale twerp is thinking,

115
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:24,351
I should be careful
who I tell about them.

116
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:28,021
[RUDEUS] I'd like to send this
to the royal palace, please.

117
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:32,067
[RUDEUS] There's one job down.
Roxy's gonna be so surprised!

118
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,319
Hope she gets back to me soon.

119
00:07:39,032 --> 00:07:40,742
What now?

120
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:42,786
[RUDEUS] If I trust
the Man-God's advice

121
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:46,039
in its entirety, all I need
to do to find Aisha is

122
00:07:46,122 --> 00:07:49,042
find the alleyway
from that vision, right?

123
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,878
But this city's so big.

124
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:56,049
And come to think of it, why was
she being detained outside?

125
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:57,759
The Man-God made it
sound like she was

126
00:07:57,842 --> 00:08:00,762
being held captive
in the palace itself.

127
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:25,954
[RUDEUS]
Who is that? Ruijerd?

128
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:30,291
No. He's great at tailing
people. I'd never notice him.

129
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,419
And it's definitely not Eris.

130
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:33,712
If she wanted to come,

131
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:35,839
she wouldn't bother
sneaking around about it.

132
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:37,632
So what the heck?

133
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:40,385
Does someone in Shirone
have a grudge against me?

134
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:43,513
How could they?
I literally just got here!

135
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:58,445
[RUDEUS]
Wait. This alley is...

136
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:00,947
[gasps]

137
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:03,283
[AISHA]
Huh? How'd he do that?

138
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:06,161
Hey! Stop it!
No, give that back!

139
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:08,747
[SOLDIER 19A] You need to
keep it down. I'm begging you.

140
00:09:09,873 --> 00:09:10,915
[SOLDIER 19A]
Please?

141
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:13,209
[AISHA]
Give me back my letter!

142
00:09:14,294 --> 00:09:15,545
[SOLDIER 19B]
Come on.

143
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:18,340
[SOLDIER 19A] Apologies.
We're only doing our jobs.

144
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,637
Uh. Sorry! This isn't
what it looks like!

145
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:30,435
Okay. But you do realize
that's kinda hard to believe.

146
00:09:30,518 --> 00:09:31,895
[SOLDIER 19A]
I hear ya, but listen, son.

147
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:34,647
He and I are soldiers from
the Shirone palace garrison.

148
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:36,441
This little girl got lost
wandering around,

149
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:38,234
and all we want to do
is escort her home.

150
00:09:38,318 --> 00:09:42,155
But you guys stole my letter!
It's mine and I want it back!

151
00:09:42,238 --> 00:09:43,698
Yeah, why would you
need to do that

152
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:46,868
if you're just trying to
get her home safely?

153
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:49,704
It's complicated, but adults
have their reasons.

154
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:50,914
[SOLDIERS gasp]

155
00:09:52,874 --> 00:09:55,710
Please! You'll help
me out, won't you?

156
00:09:59,673 --> 00:10:00,882
[SOLDIERS gasp]

157
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:04,177
Incantation-less magic! Is he?

158
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,682
[whistle blows]

159
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:20,235
Hand over the girl
and don't do anything stupid.

160
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:21,986
We don't want
anyone to get hurt.

161
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,073
Hold on tight, okay?
I'm getting us out of here.

162
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:28,660
[SOLDIERS gasp]

163
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:33,206
[AISHA screams]

164
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,383
[AISHA] Oh, by the way,
my name is Aisha Greyrat!

165
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:45,343
Thanks so much for
saving me back there!

166
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:47,804
You have my sincerest gratitude!

167
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:51,141
[RUDEUS]
Wow. She's so well-mannered.

168
00:10:51,224 --> 00:10:53,184
How old is she now? Six?

169
00:10:53,268 --> 00:10:56,938
So, um. Would you mind telling
me what your name is, mister?

170
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:59,149
[RUDEUS]
Oh! Uh.

171
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:04,612
There are some who know me
as the Moonlight Knight!

172
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:07,657
Oh, wow! That's such
an incredible name!

173
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,910
[AISHA] My apologies
if this sounds ungrateful

174
00:11:10,994 --> 00:11:12,662
after such a daring rescue,

175
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:14,831
but may I make
a selfish request?

176
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:16,082
Go ahead.

177
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,751
My mother has been
imprisoned in the castle,

178
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,461
so would you please
help me send this letter

179
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:21,338
to my father to inform him?

180
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:25,133
[RUDEUS] I see.
That's what that letter was.

181
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:28,136
Between that, her manners,
and her vocabulary,

182
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:29,512
she's one clever girl.

183
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:31,723
[RUDEUS] I'm happy to help,
but surely your mother

184
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:34,309
taught you that you need
money to send off a letter.

185
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:36,978
Oh, no, she taught me that
if a cute little girl like me

186
00:11:37,062 --> 00:11:38,146
looks up with pleading eyes and

187
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:40,065
begs sweetly to send
her father a letter,

188
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:42,442
then other people will happily
take care of the rest!

189
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:44,861
[RUDEUS]
Lilia, you scoundrel.

190
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:46,946
I've already tried to
make contact with him

191
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,867
many times before but the people
in the castle won't let me.

192
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,786
I'm really sorry to hear that.

193
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:56,373
But, uh, do you have anybody
else you could count on to help?

194
00:11:56,456 --> 00:11:57,665
Nobody.

195
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:00,752
What about, uh, a nice
young lady with blue hair

196
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:02,295
who your mother might know?

197
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:05,298
Or maybe a cool older
brother somewhere?

198
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:08,301
I do have a brother,
but I can't count on him.

199
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:09,761
[RUDEUS]
Excuse me?

200
00:12:09,844 --> 00:12:12,472
Did I not just rescue you
in the coolest way possible?

201
00:12:12,555 --> 00:12:14,599
[RUDEUS]
M-May I ask why not?

202
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:16,226
Yes, of course you may!

203
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:18,311
It all started out
with a box in our home

204
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:20,105
that my mother treasured.

205
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:22,524
She said never touch or open it,

206
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:24,984
but when I asked why,
she'd just say it was important

207
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:28,071
to my big brother
and it had to stay safe.

208
00:12:28,154 --> 00:12:30,490
But one day, when my mother
was out of the house,

209
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:31,616
I snuck a peek.

210
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,077
And guess what I found in there?

211
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,413
Something totally appropriate?

212
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:37,664
It was panties!

213
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:39,124
My brother was
completely devoted to

214
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:40,333
a pair of women's underwear

215
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:42,252
before he was even
five years old!

216
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:43,837
And a small pair, too!

217
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,505
By my calculations,
they must have

218
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:48,008
belonged to a girl of about 14.

219
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:51,511
[RUDEUS] "Calculations"?
You're supposed to be six!

220
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:53,888
This kid's gonna be way
too smart for her own good.

221
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:55,473
I dunno, it sounds
like that could be

222
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:57,017
one big misunderstanding.

223
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,603
It's not, I was able to gather
more information to verify.

224
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:03,523
My brother used to spy on
that nice lady in the bathtub,

225
00:13:03,606 --> 00:13:06,693
and on my father and his wife
when they were in bed!

226
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:08,653
He was shameless.

227
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:10,697
Mother wants to cover
it up to protect him,

228
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,032
but I am positive.

229
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:16,369
My older brother's
definitely a pervert!

230
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:23,084
Okey-dokey, then, sounds like
you got it all figured out.

231
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:25,170
That's really unfortunate.

232
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:29,090
[RUDEUS] Welp,
didn't see that one coming.

233
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:32,469
But I guess that's why the
Man-God told me to use an alias.

234
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:36,264
It's all coming
together now. Dammit.

235
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,849
If it's okay,

236
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:40,810
I would love to know what your
actual name is, Mister Knight!

237
00:13:42,437 --> 00:13:44,981
That's a secret!
But most people will know me as

238
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:47,150
the "Kennel Master"
of the party Dead End.

239
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:48,693
Oh, wow.

240
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:51,363
A name like that has to have
an incredible story behind it.

241
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:53,323
I would love to hear it!

242
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:03,458
Another time!

243
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,670
For now, how's about I go
and rescue your mother, huh?

244
00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:08,004
How are you gonna do that?

245
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:09,130
Don't you worry.

246
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:11,299
I got a couple tricks
up my sleeve!

247
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,717
So leave everything to me.

248
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:15,470
I'll show you what this
Kennel Master's made of!

249
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:23,728
[RUDEUS]
Okay, so, whenever she's around,

250
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:25,980
please only refer to me
as the "Kennel Master."

251
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:28,108
That's dumb,
why would we do that?

252
00:14:28,191 --> 00:14:29,567
Because she's kinda developed

253
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:31,986
a misguided impression
about her big brother.

254
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,279
So if we're spending
time together,

255
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:35,740
I wanna fix that by
showing her my good side.

256
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:38,201
[sighs] I think
every side of you

257
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:40,286
is your good side, but whatever.

258
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,539
Aw, Eris.

259
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,126
Ugh. What's with that
creepy grin on your face

260
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,211
whenever I compliment you?

261
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:52,882
Welp, if we're gonna
be heroes, let's go!

262
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:54,801
I haven't stormed
a castle in ages.

263
00:14:54,884 --> 00:14:56,011
[RUDEUS]
Whoa! Hang on!

264
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:57,137
Why should we?

265
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,763
I'd just feel more
secure if we waited

266
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:01,224
to hear from
my master first. 'Kay?

267
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:03,560
[whines]

268
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:08,523
[RUDEUS]
Gah, what a bunch of hotheads.

269
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,748
[GINGER]
Pardon me!

270
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:31,671
[RUDEUS]
Comin'!

271
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:37,761
[GINGER]
Would you be Lord Rudeus?

272
00:15:37,844 --> 00:15:39,095
[RUDEUS]
I would.

273
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:40,722
I am a member of
the seventh prince

274
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:42,932
of Shirone Kingdom's
imperial guard.

275
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:45,352
My name is Ginger York.

276
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:47,729
Hey, it's a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

277
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:49,647
Now, Lord Rudeus,
would you be kind enough

278
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:52,484
to accompany me
to the royal palace?

279
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:54,235
Maybe? On what business?

280
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:57,364
Pardon me. Lady Roxy
has summoned you.

281
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:02,827
Yes, absolutely,
I'll be out in a second!

282
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:05,205
[RUDEUS]
Glad that wasn't about Aisha.

283
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:06,664
What's goin' on?

284
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:08,458
[RUDEUS]
I'm going out for a bit.

285
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:11,127
[ERIS]
Sure are makin' a lotta effort.

286
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:12,837
I haven't seen
my master in a while,

287
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:14,381
so I'm kinda nervous.

288
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:17,801
[gasps] You're gonna formally
introduce me to her, right?

289
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:19,302
Yeah, of course I am!

290
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:21,805
I'll make it happen once
everything else is settled.

291
00:16:21,888 --> 00:16:23,473
[RUIJERD] Are you sure
you're fine by yourself?

292
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:25,308
Oh please, you know me.

293
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:27,894
First sign of trouble,
I'll fly right back to you two.

294
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:29,688
Will you look after Aisha?

295
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:30,897
Yeah, you got it!

296
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,358
Good luck and be safe
out there, Rudeus!

297
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:41,991
Or don't?

298
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,917
[gasps]

299
00:16:52,752 --> 00:16:55,630
[RUDEUS] So this is
where she's been living.

300
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,341
[GINGER]
Lady Roxy has told us all about

301
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:00,677
your knack for
silent spellcasting.

302
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,596
I'm honored to finally
meet her genius student.

303
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,765
[RUDEUS]
She called me a genius?

304
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:08,768
She boasts about you quite
often, as a matter of fact.

305
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:10,478
She said she felt
she wasn't qualified

306
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,772
to teach someone
of your caliber.

307
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:16,568
Uh, well, that's definitely
an exaggeration.

308
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,821
[GINGER]
This way, please.

309
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:21,031
Huh?

310
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:25,410
Okay.

311
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:40,050
[SOLDIERS] Thank you for
your dedicated service.

312
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:41,843
[RUDEUS]
Wait a sec.

313
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:44,054
You're the two guys
from yesterday, right?

314
00:17:44,137 --> 00:17:46,723
[GINGER] Excuse me.
May I take your staff and bags?

315
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:49,017
Oh, yeah, thanks.

316
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:55,398
[RUDEUS] Eh, whatever.
I should focus on Roxy for now.

317
00:17:55,482 --> 00:17:58,151
I mean, I haven't
seen her in seven years!

318
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:00,195
I have so much to tell her!

319
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:02,947
[GINGER]
Lord Rudeus. Um.

320
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:04,240
[RUDEUS]
Yes?

321
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:08,036
[GINGER]
Never mind. It's nothing.

322
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:12,248
[GINGER]
This is Ginger!

323
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:14,918
I have brought the young
Lord Rudeus with me!

324
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:16,795
[PAX]
Enter!

325
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:20,590
[RUDEUS]
A man's voice? Don't tell me.

326
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:36,731
Well, now. So, this is "Rudeus."

327
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,942
[RUDEUS]
You're kiddin' me.

328
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:41,736
Is this portly
little pipsqueak her...?

329
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:50,120
[RUDEUS]
L-Lilia? What is this?

330
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:51,955
Where's Roxy?

331
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:53,873
[PAX]
Drop him, boys!

332
00:19:05,885 --> 00:19:08,054
Ah, jeez. What the hell?

333
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:10,390
Not exactly a warm welcome.

334
00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:35,874
[PAX laughs]
It's futile!

335
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:38,084
That magic circle is
a King-class barrier

336
00:19:38,168 --> 00:19:40,879
I had created
specifically to trap Roxy!

337
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:43,965
A child like you has
no hope of breaking free!

338
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,592
And you would be?

339
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:47,385
I thought you'd never ask.

340
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:49,179
I'm Pax, seventh
prince of Shirone,

341
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:51,431
and your worst nightmare!

342
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:55,185
Is this how the throne
deals with minor offenses?

343
00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:56,978
To each their own.

344
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,606
I'll formally apologize
for yesterday, but first,

345
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:01,941
I would ask that you
please call Roxy here.

346
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:03,151
I'm her former student
and she can confirm--

347
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:05,111
[PAX]
Roxy isn't here.

348
00:20:05,195 --> 00:20:06,363
Huh?

349
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:08,198
[PAX]
Roxy isn't here!

350
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:11,993
I'm going to use you as bait
to lure her back home!

351
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,536
Your letter surprised me.

352
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,829
I never thought Roxy's lover

353
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,873
would dare show his face
in my domain!

354
00:20:16,956 --> 00:20:20,168
W-Wait, you think I'm her lover?

355
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:21,461
Aren't you?

356
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:22,962
[RUDEUS]
Oh, thank god.

357
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:24,005
Sounds like I haven't been

358
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,257
cucked by this
little creep after all.

359
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:27,550
That's something, at least.

360
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:30,470
Perish the thought, sir,
that's incomprehensible!

361
00:20:30,553 --> 00:20:34,516
I am but her humble and
utterly unworthy apprentice!

362
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:37,060
Well, good enough!

363
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:39,396
Roxy never did shut up
about her precious student,

364
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:41,731
so she'll definitely
come running back.

365
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:44,359
And when she does, that'll be
the end of her as a woman!

366
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:47,028
She'll live as my sex slave
to the end of her days!

367
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,363
She will birth my heirs!

368
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:50,615
Sorry to interrupt,
but I do have one question.

369
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:53,410
About what? Oh, yes, of course!

370
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:55,203
I'll be sure to rape her
the very first time

371
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:56,538
right before your eyes!

372
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:58,081
Then I'll pull out,
lop off your head,

373
00:20:58,164 --> 00:20:59,666
and go back for round two.

374
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:02,585
I can't wait to see you both
weeping in despair!

375
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:04,295
That's great,
but I didn't hear anything

376
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:07,632
about Lilia being held captive
until after I got here.

377
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,300
So then, with all due respect,

378
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:12,804
how is Roxy supposed to find out
that you've captured me as well?

379
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,683
Idiot! Roxy is
incredibly capable,

380
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:18,852
I'm sure she'll catch
wind of it somehow!

381
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:20,729
[RUDEUS] Unless you
put the word out yourself

382
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,564
or let us call for help,

383
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:24,441
I don't think anybody's coming.

384
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:26,276
Shut up! Don't act so smug!

385
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,111
After all, you turned up,
didn't you?

386
00:21:28,194 --> 00:21:30,030
I-- Well, that's because...

387
00:21:30,113 --> 00:21:32,490
Meh, meh, meh, meh. I bet you
think you're pretty tough

388
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:33,992
with your wordless magic,

389
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:36,494
but you don't stand a chance
against my royal authority!

390
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:39,164
Ooh, I can't wait to
see my Roxy again!

391
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:40,665
I hope she gets here soon!

392
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:42,792
This is gonna be so much fun!

393
00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:45,253
[RUDEUS]
What a moron.

394
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,673
[PAX] Gah. You incompetent boobs
still haven't found Aisha yet?

395
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:50,050
[GINGER] The guards
reported they destroyed

396
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:52,927
the letter she wrote.
Need we pursue her further?

397
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:56,639
[PAX] Of course, you idiot!
I want her back!

398
00:21:56,723 --> 00:21:59,100
Don't you care what
happens to your family?

399
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,935
[GINGER] I'll dispatch
a search party at once.

400
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,606
[PAX]
Good! Go! Dammit!

401
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:06,232
[RUDEUS]
All right, think.

402
00:22:06,316 --> 00:22:08,860
I did exactly what
the Man-God said, right?

403
00:22:08,943 --> 00:22:11,488
I met Aisha just like
I did in the vision.

404
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:14,699
I used a fake name.
I wrote to Roxy.

405
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:17,077
Was this all supposed to happen?

406
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,537
Or did I screw up somehow?
