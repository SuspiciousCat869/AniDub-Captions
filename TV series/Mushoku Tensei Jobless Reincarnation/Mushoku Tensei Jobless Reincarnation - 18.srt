00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:22,846
[PAUL]
I'm so sorry. Rudy!

2
00:00:27,726 --> 00:00:29,436
Oh, Father.

3
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:34,357
[RUDEUS] I'm sorry, too.
For everything.

4
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:05,472
I think I know what
we're having for dinner!

5
00:01:07,223 --> 00:01:08,975
Hail and well met,
fair travelers,

6
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:12,729
I am Rodriguez, third student of
Auber the Peacock Blade!

7
00:01:12,812 --> 00:01:16,191
He, in turn, pupil to the
famous North God Kalman!

8
00:01:16,274 --> 00:01:17,525
I can see from your bearing

9
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:19,527
that you are a man
of great renown!

10
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:22,030
I wish to request a bout!

11
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,162
I haven't sparred
like this in some time.

12
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,791
You have bested me!

13
00:01:32,874 --> 00:01:34,876
I marvel at your
strength, good sir!

14
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,296
In all my travels,
never have I met your match!

15
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:43,802
Fare thee well,
great warrior of the Superd!

16
00:01:43,885 --> 00:01:46,888
I hope for yet another bout
when next we meet!

17
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:52,185
Hail and well met!

18
00:01:52,268 --> 00:01:54,187
Hail and well met, sir!

19
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:15,375
[ERIS retches]

20
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,257
Rudeus, stop standing around
and heal me already.

21
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:28,138
[RUDEUS retching]

22
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:35,395
Let this divine power
be rich and nourishing--

23
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:41,818
How're you holding up, Ruijerd?
Are you okay?

24
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:43,945
I'm perfectly well,
and have no idea

25
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:45,780
why you two have fallen ill.

26
00:02:45,864 --> 00:02:48,742
Oh cool, rub it in. But hey--

27
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:52,912
[RUDEUS] I'm glad you get
to be up here with us,

28
00:02:52,996 --> 00:02:55,582
instead of having
to stow away again.

29
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:56,750
It turns out, my father is

30
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,544
good for something
after all, huh?

31
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:02,088
[RUIJERD] Try not to speak
too poorly of the man.

32
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:04,758
[chuckles] I promise you
he doesn't care.

33
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,385
Our relationship is
built on jabs like that.

34
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:09,220
I'll take your word.

35
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:13,433
[RUDEUS] Gotta say,
it's a relief to make it back

36
00:03:13,516 --> 00:03:16,895
to the Central Continent.
It's taken forever.

37
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:20,023
Though I guess this is
only another turning point.

38
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:24,235
Yes, we've still got
a long road ahead of us.

39
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,403
[RUDEUS]
Good news, though.

40
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:26,571
The captain told me
that the kingdom

41
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:28,114
we're set to travel through

42
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:31,826
is the biggest rice producer
in all the human territories.

43
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,329
[RUIJERD]
Oh? Are you fond of rice?

44
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:36,331
More than I can possibly say.

45
00:03:36,414 --> 00:03:38,083
Not to brag or anything,
but I've been known

46
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,418
to put away bowl after bowl
and still have room

47
00:03:40,502 --> 00:03:42,754
to kill a few rice balls
when I'm done.

48
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:44,673
How can you possibly
think about food

49
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:46,925
at a time like this, you weirdo?

50
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:48,551
If you feel good enough
to chitchat,

51
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:51,262
you feel good enough
to cast Healing--

52
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:53,598
[ERIS retching]

53
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:55,225
And the roads on
the Central Continent

54
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:57,310
should be pretty
well-maintained,

55
00:03:57,394 --> 00:03:58,978
so I'd like to make
a point to enjoy

56
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:00,480
our journey moving forward.

57
00:04:00,563 --> 00:04:02,524
Oh! But our families
and building up

58
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:05,568
the Superd's reputation will
still take priority, of course.

59
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:06,820
Sound good?

60
00:04:07,821 --> 00:04:10,990
Yes, sounds good. No objections.

61
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:14,661
[RUDEUS] So, Zenith, Lilia,
little Aisha, and Sylphie

62
00:04:14,744 --> 00:04:16,788
are all still
out there somewhere.

63
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:18,915
No news about any of 'em.

64
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:22,085
Heck, we don't even know
if Ghislaine's alive.

65
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:24,421
Maybe by the time
we get back to Fittoa,

66
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:27,716
everyone will there be waiting
for us, safe and sound.

67
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,968
And maybe that's too optimistic,

68
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:31,428
but tearing my
hair out with worry

69
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:33,555
won't do us any good, either.

70
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:36,725
[RUDEUS]
So why not think happy thoughts?

71
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:39,519
For better or worse, the Millis
Continent is behind us.

72
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:41,771
We'll cross the
King Dragon Realm next,

73
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,898
and after that, Shirone.

74
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:47,527
[RUDEUS] I'll finally
get to see Roxy again.

75
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,574
[RUDEUS retches]

76
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:05,211
[ROXY]
Wow. How did Blaze die?

77
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:08,882
Eaten. By Red-Hood Cobra,
if the story is true.

78
00:05:09,883 --> 00:05:12,177
[ROXY]
He was never exactly nice to me.

79
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,054
That foul mouth used to
curse up a storm

80
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:16,056
any time I stepped out of line.

81
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,599
And I remember
the constant fighting

82
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:19,768
drove Hawkendale insane.

83
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:24,522
And yet, we made a great party.

84
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:26,733
[NOKOPARA] Well, cheers to
being a support class.

85
00:05:26,816 --> 00:05:30,278
Might not have made it to
middle age, otherwise, eh?

86
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:32,906
You've really changed
over the years, Roxy.

87
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:36,409
Do you think I have?
It's kinda hard for me to tell.

88
00:05:36,493 --> 00:05:39,162
Oh, yeah! For starters, you've
gotten a lot more mature.

89
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:40,622
What's that supposed to mean?

90
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:42,248
Are you making fun
of me or something?

91
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:47,504
I'm not making fun of you!
I just mean your aura's changed.

92
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:50,048
You used to come off as
more of a kid, you know?

93
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:52,300
I've put a lot of years
behind me since then,

94
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:53,927
even if it doesn't
look that way.

95
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,346
[NOKOPARA] See, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

96
00:05:56,429 --> 00:05:57,639
'Cause back in the day?

97
00:05:57,722 --> 00:06:00,058
You were constantly
trying to act grown up

98
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:01,976
and you woulda been
ecstatic if I ever said

99
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,103
you were "mature."

100
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:05,021
Was I really?

101
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:14,656
I guess you're right.
I was like that for a long time.

102
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:16,324
I wanted to prove
I wasn't a child,

103
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,493
and that I should
be taken seriously.

104
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:20,495
Never mind that I didn't
have any real grasp

105
00:06:20,578 --> 00:06:23,540
on my own skills
or limitations yet.

106
00:06:23,623 --> 00:06:25,667
But these days,
I feel like my reputation

107
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,669
has gotten out of hand.

108
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:29,462
I know I'm a King-class
water mage,

109
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:32,465
but people constantly
expect me to do things I can't.

110
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:34,843
Like silent spellcasting.

111
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:38,972
You, on the other hand,
haven't changed a bit, though.

112
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:40,390
Apart from your face.

113
00:06:40,473 --> 00:06:41,808
[NOKOPARA]
Ooh, what're you trying to say?

114
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:43,643
I'm all old and wrinkly now?

115
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:45,562
Sure, you could put it that way.

116
00:06:45,645 --> 00:06:48,857
You got a mouth on you now,
don't ya, kiddo?

117
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,359
[ROXY] Well, prove me wrong!
What else changed?

118
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:53,319
Do you still pick on
new parties for a living?

119
00:06:53,403 --> 00:06:55,405
Hey now, don't make it
sound like extortion,

120
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:56,656
I'm just teaching them how harsh

121
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,159
the adventuring life
can be for 'em!

122
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:06,458
That being said,
I've made sure I'm

123
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:10,003
on my best behavior since I
got burned back in Rikarisu.

124
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:12,756
You got burned?
How'd you let that happen?

125
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,051
Ah. Party of three
really solid adventurers

126
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:18,345
calling themselves "Dead End."

127
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:23,641
[NOKOPARA] But that ain't
a story worth sharin'.

128
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:24,976
You tell me, though,

129
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,604
as long as you traveled
all the way back out here.

130
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:30,482
Have you visited
your parents yet?

131
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:31,816
[gasps]

132
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,943
[NOKOPARA]
Hm?

133
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:38,281
Oh, uh. I don't think that's...

134
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:46,456
No, no, no,
you gotta be kidding me.

135
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:47,624
Don't tell me you haven't been

136
00:07:47,707 --> 00:07:49,918
back to see them
once in all this time?

137
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:52,462
It's not like they'd be
happy to see me.

138
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:54,422
So why put myself through that?

139
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:57,175
Ugh. You're unbelievable.

140
00:07:57,258 --> 00:07:58,843
Okay, I take it all back.

141
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:00,512
Turns out you haven't
changed one bit

142
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:01,971
since the last time I saw you.

143
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:04,182
You're still running away
like a scared little kid.

144
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:05,600
And why do you think
you should get to

145
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:07,519
lecture me about any of this?

146
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:09,729
[NOKOPARA] Well,
I'll have you know that after

147
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:11,690
you left and
the party dissolved,

148
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:14,818
I found myself a wife
and we started a family.

149
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:16,486
I got three little ones now!

150
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:18,988
And they're so cute,
you wouldn't believe it!

151
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:21,741
Great. And that matters why?

152
00:08:23,743 --> 00:08:25,620
It matters because
sometimes we fight

153
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:27,288
like you and your
parents may have,

154
00:08:27,372 --> 00:08:28,415
but at the end of the day,

155
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:31,126
I would do or be anything
for my family.

156
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:34,129
And I can guarantee your
folks feel the same way.

157
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:37,799
[NOKOPARA] Who cares if you
can't use telepathy

158
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:39,718
like the rest of them, huh?

159
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:43,430
Some things are more important
than what you can or can't do.

160
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,517
I appreciate the effort,
but I don't think

161
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,352
I need a pep talk
from an obnoxious,

162
00:08:49,436 --> 00:08:51,062
greedy boor like you.

163
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:53,023
Then this is the last
I'll say about it,

164
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:55,525
especially 'cuz I know
you won't listen anyway:

165
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:57,819
but you really should go try
to make up with them

166
00:08:57,902 --> 00:08:59,446
before it's too late.

167
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:02,157
You've only got
one family, you know?

168
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,893
[ROXY]
I guess it's changed a little.

169
00:09:29,976 --> 00:09:34,814
Bigger. More people.
Maybe a little more greenery.

170
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:40,528
[ROXY]
But it's still eerily quiet.

171
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:49,037
[ROXY]
Please stop. I can't understand

172
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,997
what you're saying to me.

173
00:09:57,837 --> 00:10:00,632
[ROXY] That's the look
they give outsiders.

174
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:11,101
[ROXY] I've been a stranger
to my own people

175
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:12,894
from the day I was born.

176
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:15,438
Constantly alienated, excluded.

177
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:17,440
Can't say I missed that.

178
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:21,736
[ROXY]
I hate this stupid village.

179
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:26,658
[ROXY] Never thought I'd come
back here of my own free will.

180
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:32,997
[KIDS giggling]

181
00:11:15,498 --> 00:11:16,624
[thud]

182
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:29,929
May this divine power offer

183
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:33,183
the strength to
rise again. Healing.

184
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:29,823
[pants]

185
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,381
You're not busy, are you?

186
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:50,969
[ROWIN gasps]
Roxy!

187
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:57,475
It's been such a long time.

188
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:00,729
Welcome home, my darling girl!
Have you been all right?

189
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:03,940
And what have you been doing?
Are you traveling alone?

190
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:06,109
[ROXY]
I... Um...

191
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:08,778
We've actually heard a few
stories about you from visitors,

192
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:11,656
but why don't you
fill us in on the rest?

193
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:15,994
[ROXY]
It's kind of a lot.

194
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:23,335
Well, either way,
it's such a relief

195
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:24,669
to know that you're safe.

196
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:27,005
Will you stay a while
before you have to leave?

197
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:29,674
Please, we'd be more
than happy to have you.

198
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:49,235
Uh, about that.

199
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:50,445
[gasps]

200
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:52,655
[ROXY]
I should probably go now.

201
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:57,869
[ROWIN]
You're leaving so soon?

202
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:00,747
Yeah.

203
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,499
Roxy, at least stay the night!

204
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:04,793
[ROXY]
I can't. I have urgent business.

205
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:07,212
I just wanted to stop by.

206
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:10,048
Then, when can we expect
to see you again?

207
00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:15,720
[ROXY] I don't know. Honestly.
I might not come back at all.

208
00:14:16,596 --> 00:14:17,972
[ROKARI gasps]

209
00:14:24,771 --> 00:14:25,939
[gasps]

210
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:30,568
Roxy, dear.

211
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:34,239
Surely you can visit
every 20 years or so at least.

212
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:37,242
I'll see what I can do.

213
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:40,787
Maybe I'll get to stop by
sometime in the next 50 years.

214
00:14:41,788 --> 00:14:44,916
Do you promise?
We'll be waiting!

215
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:48,878
Okay.

216
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:00,890
Look at me.

217
00:15:00,974 --> 00:15:05,562
I promised myself I wouldn't cry
if I ever got to see you again.

218
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:10,066
[ROKARI]
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:13,820
Hey, it's okay.

220
00:15:24,372 --> 00:15:26,249
[gasps]

221
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:34,090
[ROXY laughing]

222
00:15:34,174 --> 00:15:38,845
[ROKARI]
Now, let's see. Ah, here we go.

223
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:41,014
Looks like this one
is called a "horse."

224
00:15:41,097 --> 00:15:43,183
That's a horse!

225
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:46,644
[ROKARI]
And this right here is a "pelt."

226
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:48,104
[ROXY]
Pelt!

227
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:50,899
That was perfect, Roxy,
you're doing so well!

228
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:53,026
That's my brilliant girl!

229
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:02,369
[ROXY]
Can I play with you?

230
00:16:05,622 --> 00:16:06,790
[gasps]

231
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:16,257
[ROKARI]
Roxy!

232
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:26,184
[ROXY cries]
Am I a bad girl?

233
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:30,355
Is that why no one ever
wants to talk to me?

234
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:34,818
[ROKARI]
No, honey. It's my fault.

235
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:38,863
I'm so sorry, Roxy.
You're not a bad girl.

236
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:41,449
[ROXY]
My people don't say anything

237
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,411
truly important
with their mouths.

238
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:47,080
But I could tell my parents
were heartbroken,

239
00:16:47,163 --> 00:16:49,666
and I knew it was because of me.

240
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:53,753
Without telepathy,
I would always be an outcast.

241
00:16:55,755 --> 00:16:58,883
[ROXY] That's why I eventually
ran away from home.

242
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:02,595
I honestly thought they would
all be happier without me.

243
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,889
But maybe...

244
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:09,728
[crying]

245
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,709
Roxy, what's the matter?

246
00:17:35,712 --> 00:17:37,172
[ROXY]
I'm so sorry!

247
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:40,842
I'm so sorry I left
without saying anything!

248
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:56,191
[ROXY]
I'm sorry, Dad.

249
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:04,699
[ROXY] Just maybe.
Words and language have never

250
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:08,370
been what mattered most.
To any of us.

251
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:40,485
Oh, look who finally
decided to join us!

252
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:41,361
Sleep well?

253
00:18:41,444 --> 00:18:42,862
[ROKARI giggles]

254
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:46,116
Yeah, I guess.

255
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:48,868
Thanks for asking. Good morning.

256
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,469
[ROWIN] Are you planning
to leave today?

257
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:10,640
Yeah. I would stay,
but I came out here

258
00:19:10,724 --> 00:19:14,102
to look for some friends
who are missing.

259
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:16,771
My apprentice is one of them.

260
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,440
I understand.

261
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:22,485
Wait, now that you mention it,

262
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:24,237
a boy who said he was
a student of yours

263
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,156
visited about two years ago.

264
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:27,282
Huh?

265
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:29,993
Yes, uh. What did he
say his name was?

266
00:19:30,076 --> 00:19:31,369
Rudeus, wasn't it?

267
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:33,413
That sounds right,
Rudeus Greyrat!

268
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:35,373
What?

269
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:36,916
I wonder if those
sweet children have

270
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,877
made it all the way
back home by now.

271
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,295
Hang on, did you say "children"?

272
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:42,255
You mean he had
somebody else here with him?

273
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:43,548
Yes, that's right.

274
00:19:43,631 --> 00:19:45,550
He was traveling
with a girl called Eris,

275
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:48,386
and Mister Ruijerd decided he
would help escort them home.

276
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,889
Oh, Ruijerd is a member
of the Superd tribe.

277
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:53,433
H-H-H-He-He's a what now?

278
00:19:53,516 --> 00:19:54,809
Yes, we started dealing with him

279
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,479
not too long after you
left the village, actually.

280
00:19:57,562 --> 00:19:59,397
We'd always been
afraid of the Superd,

281
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:01,316
but he turned out to be quite--

282
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:03,526
Uh... Roxy?

283
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:05,862
[ROKARI]
Oh dear!

284
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:14,496
[ROXY] I'll be sure
to visit again soon.

285
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:15,705
[ROWIN]
Good.

286
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:17,624
And feel free to bring
cute little Rudeus

287
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:19,292
with you next time!

288
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:23,213
Huh?

289
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:28,843
Uh-- Absolutely not!
You'll do no such thing!

290
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,566
[ROXY] I just can't wrap
my head around the fact

291
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,695
that Rudeus is traveling
with a Superd.

292
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,863
But if there's
a girl with them, too.

293
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,573
That must mean the infamous trio

294
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:53,785
calling themselves
"Dead End" is them.

295
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:56,079
That's the only
viable conclusion.

296
00:20:56,162 --> 00:20:57,747
[sighs]

297
00:20:57,831 --> 00:21:00,625
[ROXY] Everything is finally
starting to make sense.

298
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:02,919
I thought surely no one
would be foolhardy enough

299
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:05,213
to impersonate Dead End,

300
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:07,215
but I wouldn't
put it past Rudeus.

301
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:09,300
He's fearless.

302
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:12,554
And if all of that is sanctioned
by the real Dead End?

303
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:16,057
How amazing will
that boy turn out to be?

304
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,600
Hey. I'm back.

305
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:20,562
[ELINALISE] I'm sorry, love,
I thought you'd be gone longer!

306
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:26,484
[ELINALISE moaning]

307
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,821
[ELINALISE]
Uh! Please don't!

308
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:31,823
[ROXY]
Icicle Break!

309
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:37,620
[sighs]

310
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:39,080
[ELINALISE]
That's going to keep happening,

311
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,457
you should get used to it.

312
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,625
[ROXY] Or you could stop
doing it where anyone

313
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:44,461
could walk in on you
without warning.

314
00:21:44,544 --> 00:21:46,671
Oh, I could, but where's
the fun in that?

315
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:48,465
I like when people get to watch.

316
00:21:48,548 --> 00:21:50,216
[ROXY sighs]

317
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,427
Hey, where are we off to next?

318
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,888
[ROXY] I think we should
head for the northern shore.

319
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:56,931
For the time being,
I'd like to focus our efforts

320
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,684
on finding Zenith,
Lilia, and Aisha.

321
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:02,771
[TALHAND] You don't want to
look for your student?

322
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,189
[ROXY]
Not right now.

323
00:22:04,272 --> 00:22:06,858
I have it on good authority
that he's in safe hands.

324
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:10,653
I know we'll get to see
each other again eventually.

325
00:22:10,737 --> 00:22:13,948
And there are plenty of other
cities we haven't checked yet.

326
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:17,243
So let's keep moving,
just like we have been.
