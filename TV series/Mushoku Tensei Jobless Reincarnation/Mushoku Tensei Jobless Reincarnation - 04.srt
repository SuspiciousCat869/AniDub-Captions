1
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,261
That's great!
Congratulations, Mother!

2
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:12,763
You're such a sweetheart.

3
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,057
And I just know you're going to
be an excellent big brother

4
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,017
when this little one
comes along.

5
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,143
We did it, Zenith!

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,896
I'm so glad.

7
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:24,483
[PAUL] I can't believe our
little family's finally growing!

8
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,068
[RUDEUS] Zenith has been
worried that she couldn't

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,611
have a second child.

10
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:31,073
So, naturally, she and Paul
were overjoyed at the news.

11
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,450
[ALL laugh]

12
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,539
My humble apologies.
I'm afraid I'm pregnant.

13
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,586
[RUDEUS]
Time froze.

14
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:47,464
No one bothered to ask
who the father was.

15
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:50,342
Nor did anyone have to.

16
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,385
Forgive me, Zenith.

17
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,680
That child's, uh,
it's probably mine.

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,265
[RUDEUS]
Pathetic.

19
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,810
But, good on him for
coming clean so fast.

20
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,603
I suppose if he's
always going to lecture me

21
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:05,315
about "being a real man,"
that's the least he can do.

22
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:09,069
So, you know, that's gotta
count for something.

23
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,113
[slap]

24
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,408
[RUDEUS] But this is
a nightmare scenario.

25
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,753
[ZENITH]
So. What will you do?

26
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,214
After I've assisted you
with childbirth, My Lady,

27
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,508
I plan to take my leave of you.

28
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,968
[ZENITH]
And your child?

29
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,805
I hope to raise it
back in my hometown.

30
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,308
[ZENITH] That's a month's
ride south, isn't it?

31
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,185
Yes.

32
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,438
[ZENITH] You'll have to have
your baby here first.

33
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,982
You'll be in no
condition to travel.

34
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,365
Well, be that as it may.
I have nowhere else I can turn.

35
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,117
Zenith, s‐surely she can
just stay with u‐‐

36
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,160
[ZENITH]
You stay out of this!

37
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,455
[RUDEUS] A month of
unaccompanied travel

38
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,709
is a tall order for
a woman with a newborn.

39
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,293
This is supposed to be
a safe country,

40
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,505
but I still doubt they
would make it in one piece.

41
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,341
[RUDEUS]
And Zenith is right.

42
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,845
Even if Lilia has the stamina
to make it all the way there,

43
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,640
the odds of an infant surviving
the trip are pretty slim.

44
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:48,228
And if Lilia collapses,
they're both dead for sure.

45
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,858
It's not hard to imagine:
Lilia lying in the snow.

46
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,235
Baby cradled in her arms.

47
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,324
[RUDEUS]
Of course Zenith is conflicted.

48
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,493
Lilia has been faithful
to this house for years,

49
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:07,414
and‐‐this drama aside‐‐
they're friends.

50
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,166
I don't want to
lose her, either.

51
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,793
She brings me towels
when I train outside,

52
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,713
and draws baths when
I get caught in the rain.

53
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,174
She lays out blankets
when it's cold

54
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,676
and tidies up if
I leave books out.

55
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,763
[RUDEUS]
And most importantly.

56
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:27,350
She knows about the holy relic
and has kept it secret.

57
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,275
[RUDEUS]
It's time I return the favor.

58
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,988
Mother, I thought it
would be a good thing

59
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,699
that I'm gonna get two new
siblings instead of just one,

60
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,785
so why is everyone so upset?

61
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,286
[ZENITH]
It means your father and Lilia

62
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,746
did something very bad.

63
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,581
I guess I get it.

64
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,291
But to me it didn't
sound like Lilia

65
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,294
was allowed to say no to him.

66
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:55,796
What do you mean?

67
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,715
It kinda sounded like Father
was threatening her before.

68
00:04:58,757 --> 00:04:59,591
[gasps]

69
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,509
Huh?

70
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,636
[RUDEUS] A while ago, I got up
in the middle of the night

71
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,929
to use the bathroom.

72
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,347
And when I passed Lilia's room,

73
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,432
I thought I heard Father
say something like,

74
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,185
"Spread your legs if you don't
want people to find out."

75
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,603
[PAUL]
Rudy! What the hell are you‐‐

76
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,313
I said keep your mouth shut!

77
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,856
[PAUL]
B‐But, hang on.

78
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,484
Lilia, dear. Tell me,
is that true?

79
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,737
The Young Master
must be mistaken.

80
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,405
No, forgive me.

81
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,990
I see you're trying
to protect yourself.

82
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,992
Now, hold on just a second.

83
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,244
I‐I never said that.

84
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,579
[RUDEUS] I appreciate
your help with Sylphie,

85
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,290
but I'll have to pay you back
for that some other time.

86
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,084
You kinda dug your
own grave on this one.

87
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,669
Sorry, Paul.

88
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,254
I really don't
believe that Lilia

89
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,632
did anything wrong, Mother.
It's all Father's fault.

90
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,260
I suppose.

91
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,887
So, it wouldn't be fair for her
to get in so much trouble

92
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,640
for something she
didn't do, right?

93
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,684
Well. No.

94
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,479
And you know I have a lot of fun
playing with Sylphie every day!

95
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,064
So don't you think
it would be nice

96
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,692
for the new baby
to have a friend, too?

97
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,029
Perhaps, yes.

98
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,366
And no matter what,

99
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,411
I'm gonna be a big brother
to both of them.

100
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,960
So please, Mother.
Don't make her leave.

101
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,462
I don't wanna say
goodbye to Lilia!

102
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,553
All right, Rudy.

103
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,889
I get it. You win.

104
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,433
[RUDEUS]
You didn't make it easy, Madame.

105
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,060
Lilia. Please stay.

106
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,021
You're part of the family now.

107
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,981
It would be foolish
to ask you to leave.

108
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,066
[gasps]

109
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,027
[RUDEUS]
Great. Glad that's settled.

110
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,280
Any further damage control
is up to you, Paul.

111
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,740
Sure hope you can handle it.

112
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,118
This is your last chance, SeÃ±or.

113
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,828
As for you.

114
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,413
I hope you're prepared
to have a nice,

115
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,290
long talk about all this later.

[RUDEUS grunting]

118
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,559
That's way too hard!

119
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,020
Please stop taking
this out on me!

120
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,816
[LILIA]
I shouldn't have been spared.

121
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,070
This pregnancy is my fault.

122
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,113
I was the one who seduced Paul.

[PAUL, ZENITH moaning]

124

[LILIA] After years of
hearing them carry on

125
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,080
like that night after night,

126
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,791
I finally reached
a breaking point.

127
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,629
[LILIA] I'm honestly amazed
I held out this long.

[PAUL gasps]

131
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,951
[LILIA]
I deserved to be punished.

132
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,577
For giving in.

133
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,038
For betraying Zenith.

134
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,249
But I was forgiven.

135
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,626
Rudeus made that happen.

136
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,796
He even guided us to
an elegant compromise.

137
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,340
He understood the
situation I was in

138
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,885
and was willing to
lie to protect me.

139
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,638
I've always been
frightened of that child.

140
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,975
So I've made a point of avoiding
him as much as possible.

141
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,894
[LILIA] As a baby,
he used to stare at my chest

142
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,063
with that repulsive grin.

143
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,606
It was unnerving.

144
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,526
I thought he might be possessed.

145
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,487
But it's time I let go
of that nonsense.

146
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:55,410
He saved my life, and for that,
he deserves my respect.

147
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,288
If this child grows up
healthy and strong,

148
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,956
I will see to it that
they make their way

149
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,333
into Lord Rudeus's service.

150
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,335
It's the least I can do.

childrearing should feel like.

160
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,328
Things with Young Master
Rudeus were much too easy!

161
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,913
You're all right.

162
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:43,333
Darling? Would you
go draw some water?

163
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,960
[LILIA] Oh! And would you mind
picking up some more candles,

164
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,045
as long as you're out?

165
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,172
[PAUL]
Uh. Sure.

166
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,093
Sylphie. I think I
have to be the cool

167
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,678
male role model for those girls.

168
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,642
[RUDEUS]
Ever since the "incident,"

169
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,144
Lilia's actually
been talking to me.

170
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,939
Mostly old stories about Paul.

171
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,565
Turns out, they studied
swordsmanship

172
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,400
at the same training hall.

173
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,152
She told me he was
very talented,

174
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,821
but preferred to goof off.

175
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,073
Also, true to form,
how he'd snuck in her room

176
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,243
to assault and deflower
her as she slept.

177
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,286
And then he just bailed.

178
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,955
Like a dirtbag.

179
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,875
[PAUL] Rudy! It's time for
practice, let's get to work!

180
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,131
[PAUL]
Do you want to loosen up

181
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,716
or do you want to stay
Elementary rank forever?

182
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:37,595
[RUDEUS] Paul may be childish,
irresponsible trash,

183
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,848
but I don't think he's
rotten to the core.

184
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,976
And despite all his faults,
I respect his strength.

185
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,435
[gasps]

186
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,563
[RUDEUS]
There are three sword styles:

187
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,732
Sword God, Water God,
and North God.

188
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,527
Paul is Advanced in all three.

189
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,864
[RUDEUS gasps]

190
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,492
Hey, watch it, boy,
that's cheating!

191
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,411
[gasps]

192
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,830
Heh. You might have
a little talent for magic,

193
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,874
but your swordplay
has already stagnated.

194
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,333
What a shame.

195
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,920
Wipe that look off
your face and stand up.

196
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,130
Don't you want to grow up to be

197
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,257
a cool guy like your
old man, here?

198
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,675
[RUDEUS] I didn't think
it was very "cool"

199
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:19,804
to cheat on your wife and
almost rip your family apart.

200
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,181
If it bothers you to hear that,

201
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,642
would you please keep your hands
off anyone who isn't Mother?

202
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,562
Uh, other than Lilia, right?

203
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,105
I dunno, if it happens again,

204
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,691
Mother might move
back in with her family.

205
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,444
Come on, you're
a guy, you get it.

206
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,613
What exactly do you think
a seven‐year‐old boy

207
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,697
is supposed to "get"?

208
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,699
Well, I know you're
into little Sylphie,

209
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,618
and you gotta admit
that girl is gonna be

210
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,953
a total knockout
when she grows up.

211
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,246
Yeah, of course she is,

212
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,208
but I happen to think that
she's super beautiful already.

213
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,709
So you do understand.

214
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,336
Uh. Yeah, yeah.

215
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,254
[RUDEUS]
Paul's a scumbag all right,

216
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,381
but we speak the same language.

217
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,258
What am I now, forty‐something?

218
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,845
I was hot garbage in
my day, too. I can't judge.

219
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,222
By the way, Rudy.

220
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,182
I want to talk you about‐‐

221
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,185
You know what, never mind.

222
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,854
We should probably
get back to training.

223
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:10,772
What is it?

224
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,816
[PAUL] Hm? Nothing.
Just that you're at an age

225
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,903
where kids normally
start attending school.

226
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,363
[RUDEUS]
Yeah, I know.

227
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,781
You don't need it, though.

228
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,408
You can already read,
write, and do math.

229
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,662
[RUDEUS]
Well, yeah.

230
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,456
Still. I might wanna.

231
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,291
Are you being serious right now?

232
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,752
Ha. Well, don't think
too hard about it.

233
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,421
Joints like that are all
full of bratty nobles.

234
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,215
A nerdy little kid
from the sticks

235
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,217
would get bullied for sure.

236
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,471
And I'll tell ya something else,
the girls in those places

237
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,099
never exercised a single
day in their lives.

238
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,101
Sure, they look good
on the surface.

239
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,103
Then you get 'em into bed
with their corsets off

240
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,312
and they're a total mess.

241
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,649
Honestly I've been tricked more
times than I care to admit.

242
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,067
That's unfortunate.

243
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,027
I was kinda looking forward
to building a harem

244
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,529
like my dear old dad.

245
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,865
Hey! Would ya look at that,
you're my son after all!

246
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:07,161
But, uh, you're better off
chasing just one lady at a time.

247
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,248
[RUDEUS]
Yeah.

248
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,301
[RUDEUS]
Smart and talented.

249
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,053
She's going to surpass me
before too long.

250
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,931
School, huh?

251
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,559
Rudy! What do you
wanna do today?

252
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,185
[RUDEUS sighs]

253
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,020
Uh?

254
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,688
Oh, sorry, say what?

255
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,190
You've been acting
weird again lately.

256
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,819
According to my parents, I've
been weird since I was born.

257
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:43,197
That's not what I mean.
You look sad about something.

258
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,575
I've been kinda stuck lately.

259
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,453
I haven't made any progress
with swords or magic.

260
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,580
But you're already
amazing, Rudy.

261
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:54,083
For my age, but I still
have a long way to go.

262
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,378
[SYLPHIE]
Are you gonna leave?

263
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,504
[RUDEUS]
I might.

264
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,758
I don't think this village has
much to offer me anymore.

265
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,135
[RUDEUS gasps]

266
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,058
Hey, you okay, Sylphie?

267
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:14,270
[SYLPHIE]
No. No. Please don't leave me.

268
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,273
I don't want you to go anywhere.

269
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,403
Whoa, hey. It's okay.

270
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,531
I understand. I'll stay
right here with you.

271
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,450
[RUDEUS] Yeah, why would I
ever want to leave a girl

272
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:32,038
like her behind? Just to
improve my magic? [chuckles]

273
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,956
What would be
so great about that?

274
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,042
I'd much rather live
out my days peacefully,

275
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,586
right here, beside her.

276
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,838
So, that's exactly what I'll do.

277
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,799
And as we grow up together,

278
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,928
I'll have plenty of time to make
her my ideal woman. [chuckles]

279
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,805
[RUDEUS]
Sylphie!

280
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,681
‐‐Hey. Rudy!
‐‐[RUDEUS gasps]

281
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,891
[chuckles]

282
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,560
[RUDEUS] Didn't anyone ever tell
you it's polite to knock first?

283
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,021
Whoa, calm down,
you've got a letter.

284
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,315
A letter?

285
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,819
[ROXY] Dear Rudeus, I hope you
and your family are well.

286
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,153
I can't believe
it's already been

287
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,572
two whole years since we parted.

288
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,700
[ROXY] I'm currently working
in the royal capital

289
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,160
of the Shirone Kingdom.

290
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,205
I've been hired as tutor
to the seventh prince.

291
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,583
[ROXY] His Highness
reminds me a bit of you.

292
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,294
He's not quite as talented,
but he's clever.

293
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,713
A budding magician
in his own right.

294
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,716
[ROXY] And, also like you,
he's prone to

295
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,011
stealing my underwear and
spying on me while I change.

296
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,348
They do say great men
have great lusts.

297
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,686
I gotcha! Oh, that's the stuff.

298
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,147
[PAX screams]

299
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,607
[ROXY] Oh! And I'm
pleased to say I finally

300
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,068
mastered King‐Class water magic.

301
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,361
I thought I'd reached my limit,

302
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:49,031
but good old‐fashioned
effort goes a long way.

303
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,783
I wouldn't be surprised
if you're already

304
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,952
casting Emperor‐Class magic.

305
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,829
I'm excited,
and a little nervous,

306
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,747
to see what you can do someday.

307
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,209
And I promise to work hard
to keep up with you.

308
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,711
I doubt I need to worry,

309
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,963
but if you do hit
a dead end in your studies,

310
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,923
I would urge you again
to seek admission

311
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,302
to the Ranoa
University of Magic.

312
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,805
Good luck! I'll write
again soon. Roxy.

313
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,807
Master Roxy.

314
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,934
So that sweet little
girl has ranked

315
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,686
all the way up to a Water King.

316
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,979
Good for her.

317
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,355
Is that hard to do?

318
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,191
Indescribably hard.

319
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,109
As a matter of fact,
I'd be willing to bet that

320
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,320
you could count all the
active King‐Class mages

321
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,030
in the world on one hand.

322
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,239
Oh, wow.

323
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,200
But, uh. Kiddo?

324
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,327
Did you really
steal her panties?

325
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,953
[RUDEUS]
Busted.

326
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,749
[RUDEUS]
Talk about a wake‐up call.

327
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,335
Now what? Damn it.

328
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,921
I don't want to
disappoint my master.

329
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,467
Ranoa University of Magic. Huh.

330
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,975
Listen, Father?

331
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,353
May I make kind of an
unreasonable request?

332
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,230
You may not.

333
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,106
You can ask us
for anything, dear.

334
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,108
I'm sure your father
will manage somehow.

335
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,361
What a golden
opportunity to actually

336
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,112
demonstrate some
paternal dignity.

337
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,782
He wants something so crazy
that he asked permission

338
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,326
just to bring it up,
so I'm sure it's impossi‐‐

339
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,245
I'm starting to worry
that I won't improve

340
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,621
much more on my own.

341
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,456
So, I decided that
I would like to attend

342
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,708
the Ranoa University of Magic.

343
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,793
Oh yeah?

344
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,545
But when I brought
that up to Sylphie,

345
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,297
she started to cry and
begged me not to leave her.

346
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,299
Attaboy, I wonder
where you learned

347
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,676
to be such a lady‐killer.

348
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,177
The ideal solution would be for

349
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,971
the two of us
to enroll together,

350
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,140
but her family isn't
as well‐off as we are.

351
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,811
I was hoping you could
pay tuition for both of us.

352
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,854
So, please think about it?

353
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:49,360
Ohh. All the way to
Ranoa? Not a chance.

354
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,157
[PAUL] But to make sure
you understand why:

355
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,451
First, you're still
learning the sword.

356
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,580
As your teacher, I refuse
to let you quit now.

357
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,374
Second, you're smart,
but you're young.

358
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,711
It would be irresponsible of us
to send you away at your age.

359
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,629
Then, there's the money.

360
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:12,592
Paying for you is fine, but we
can't pay for Sylphie, too.

361
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:16,095
Got it? We're comfortable,
but we aren't nobles.

362
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,432
Of course not. In that case,

363
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,642
may I ask for
something else instead?

364
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:22,768
[PAUL]
Shoot.

365
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,645
[RUDEUS]
I would like to find a job.

366
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,772
As well‐paid as possible.

367
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,233
A job? What for?

368
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,153
By the time you decide that
I'm ready to leave home,

369
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,031
I hope to earn Sylphie's
tuition all by myself.

370
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,825
[PAUL] That might not be in
Sylphie's best interests.

371
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,078
[RUDEUS] Maybe not,
but I think it will be in mine.

372
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,713
Very well, then.
If your mind's made up,

373
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,590
I'll see what I can do for you.

374
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,718
[gasps] Thank you so much!

375
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,541
Good to see you, Ghislaine,
feels like it's been forever.

376
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,007
Idiot.

377
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,261
[RUDEUS]
Madam Titty Kitty!

378
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,848
Ghislaine, hi! I've missed you!

379
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,141
Have you been well?

380
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,019
Yeah. That your kid?

381
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,689
[ZENITH]
Yes! This is Norn.

382
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,858
[GHISLAINE] Let's hope she
doesn't take after Paul.

383
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,151
That's enough chit‐chat,

384
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,071
I assume if you're here that
means everything is ready to go.

385
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:57,947
Yeah.

386
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,449
Please take care of
our little Rudeus.

387
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,909
Can do.

388
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,872
[LILIA] Young Master Rudeus.
We'll miss you very much.

389
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,207
[RUDEUS]
Huh?

390
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,959
[ZENITH]
Take care, sweetheart.

391
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,087
We'll see you when
you get back, okay?

392
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,922
"Get back" from what,
I'm not going anywh‐‐

393
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,674
[PAUL]
Listen, Rudy.

394
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,592
[RUDEUS]
Yeah? What's wrong?

395
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,303
Tell me something.
What if I said you had to

396
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,597
stay away from Sylphie
for a little while?

397
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,976
Huh? Well, obviously
I wouldn't want to.

398
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,352
I figured.

399
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,938
Why, what's going on?

400
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,107
Nope. Don't even ask.

401
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,567
I know if I try to explain,

402
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,485
you'll just talk
your way out of it.

403
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:37,737
[RUDEUS]
Huh?

404
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,160
[grunts]

405
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,856
[gasps]

406
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,112
[RUDEUS]
That's Water God Style.

407
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:23,240
[RUDEUS sighs]
At least it's a wooden sword.

408
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,283
[PAUL grunts]

409
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,417
[gasps]

410
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,344
That hurt, Paul. What the hell?

411
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,184
[RUDEUS]
What happened?

412
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,811
I'm Rudeus Greyrat.

413
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,605
And I hope you'll
forgive my confusion.

414
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,692
You sure you're Paul's kid?
You seem way too polite.

415
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,029
My names Ghislaine.

416
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,990
Starting tomorrow we will
be working together.

417
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,326
It'll be my pleasure.

418
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,912
It's very nice to meet you.
