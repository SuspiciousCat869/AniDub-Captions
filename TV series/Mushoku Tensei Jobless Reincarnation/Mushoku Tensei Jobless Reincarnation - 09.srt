1
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,388
Huh?

2
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:23,398
[RUDEUS]
Well. Guess it's over.

3
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,111
[sighs]

4
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:32,032
Hey, nice to meet you!
Rudeus, right?

5
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,538
Excuse me, but who
or what are you?

6
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,665
You mean you can't tell?

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,504
[RUDEUS]
You're just kinda blurry.

8
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,508
I'm a god!
The Man‐God, specifically.

9
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,177
"Man‐God." If you say so.

10
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,305
[MAN‐GOD] And you're leading
quite an interesting life.

11
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,766
I've been watching you
for some time.

12
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,061
So you're a voyeur.

13
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:04,523
Yes, you could say that,
and I've enjoyed the show.

14
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,984
But I decided it was
time to intervene.

15
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,361
Don't worry, I'm on your side.

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,990
Ha! "My side"? Now that's rich!

17
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,783
Why would you even
get my hopes up?

18
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,286
I thought I was reborn, but no.

19
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,454
So I hope you enjoyed
yourself, sadist.

20
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,832
I have no reason
to trust you now!

21
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,959
Somebody's touchy.

22
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,128
Well. I have a little
friendly advice.

23
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,714
Yeah, you and every
other jerk I've ever known.

24
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,924
Take your self‐help
crap and shove it.

25
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,050
That's not what I‐‐

26
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,927
You can't possibly
think an attitude change

27
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,554
is gonna make a difference.

28
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,222
Being optimistic
only sets you up

29
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,641
for way more pain down the line.

30
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,560
Like right now!

31
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,273
[MAN‐GOD]
You've misunderstood me.

32
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:50,611
I want to help you,
not the past you.

33
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,279
Then why do I look like this?

34
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,031
[MAN‐GOD]
It's your astral form.

35
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,949
Your body's the same.

36
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,410
So you mean...
This is the dream,

37
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,996
and I'm not actually
stuck back in this shitty body?

38
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,205
Yes!

39
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,709
When you wake up, you'll be
exactly as you left yourself.

40
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:10,172
Okay then. That's a relief.

41
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,467
I imagine! I was surprised!

42
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,260
Your mental image
of yourself is,

43
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,596
let's say "different,"
sugar bear.

44
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,223
So? What do you want with me?

45
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,725
You gonna send me
back to my world

46
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,560
'cause I don't belong here, or?

47
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:24,645
[MAN‐GOD]
Oh, of course not.

48
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,146
I couldn't send you
anywhere outside

49
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,358
the Six‐Sided World
even if I wanted to.

50
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,818
[sighs] If you can't
send me back,

51
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,905
then you must not be the one
who reincarnated me here.

52
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,240
No, sir. Reincarnation would be

53
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,743
the wicked
Dragon‐God's department.

54
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,745
[RUDEUS]
Great, evil dragon.

55
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,330
So, advice, how 'bout it?

56
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,164
[RUDEUS]
Nope.

57
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,375
Uh‐‐ And why not?

58
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,668
You're shady.

59
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,086
[MAN‐GOD]
Aw, come on!

60
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,755
Don't be stubborn,
just give me a chance!

61
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,340
No thanks, I'm not
gonna fall for

62
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,175
the "just the tip" approach.

63
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,135
You kinda suck as a conman.

64
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,888
[MAN‐GOD]
Ugh, you wound me.

65
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,682
But ignore me if you want.

66
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,392
It's your funeral.

67
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,312
My what? What do you mean?

68
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,982
Well, the Demon Continent
is a harsh land.

69
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,903
There's barely any food,
and it's crawling with monsters.

70
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,613
Think you can handle it?

71
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,157
[RUDEUS] Wha? Why would
I be way out there?

72
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,159
You, my friend,
were caught up in

73
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,037
a huge mana disaster
and got teleported.

74
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,374
[RUDEUS] I guess now I know what
that explosion of light was.

75
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,712
So what do you think, boo boo?

76
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,797
Are you confident
you can survive,

77
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:37,217
stranded in a dangerous land?

78
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,430
[RUDEUS]
Fine! I get your point.

79
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,224
Go ahead, give me
whatever advice you want.

80
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:49,396
[MAN‐GOD]
Good, good. Now. Rudeus.

81
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,314
Listen closely.

82
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:56,236
When you wake up,
there will be a man nearby.

83
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:59,281
Rely on that man, okay?

84
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:04,870
And. Help him.
Whatever it takes.

85
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,216
[RUDEUS gasps]

86
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,984
[RUDEUS pants]

87
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,203
That's a relief.

88
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,836
Where's Ghislaine?

89
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,093
Is that you?

90
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,102
[gasps] A Superd!

91
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,911
Huh?

92
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,667
[RUDEUS]
Um, hello.

93
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,931
I don't understand
your question.

94
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,268
I watched you two
fall from the sky.

95
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:55,897
I know human children are frail,
so I made a fire to warm you.

96
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,401
[RUDEUS]
Uh. You saved us, then.

97
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,861
Thank you for that.

98
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:06,533
[RUDEUS] There wasn't, um,
anyone else nearby, was there?

99
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,118
A beast‐woman?

100
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,998
[RUIJERD] I only found
the two of you. My apologies.

101
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,791
No, that's all right.

102
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,629
Does the sight of me
not frighten you, boy?

103
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:23,425
It would be rude to be afraid
of you after you rescued us.

104
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:29,514
Interesting. You are
a very strange child.

105
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,392
[ERIS grunts]

106
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,899
[RUDEUS]
I'm Rudeus Greyrat, by the way.

107
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,777
Ruijerd Superdia.

108
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,075
[RUDEUS]
Pardon. May I sit?

109
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,956
[RUDEUS]
So. Where are we?

110
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,042
The Northeast Demon Continent.

111
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,960
The Biegoya region.

112
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,464
[RUDEUS]
Hard to believe.

113
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,633
We're a long way from home.

114
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,844
[RUDEUS] Getting back
to the Central Continent

115
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,847
won't exactly be
a walk in the park.

116
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,600
[RUIJERD] How did you
come to be here, child?

117
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,726
Not sure.

118
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:19,272
I think we got caught up in some
kind of giant mana disaster.

119
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,982
[RUIJERD]
Fear not.

120
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,069
It will be my pleasure
to protect you from harm.

121
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,117
[RUDEUS]
Huh?

122
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,290
I swear on the honor
of the Superd.

123
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,876
You will see
your homeland again.

124
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,544
For whatever that's worth,

125
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,172
I'm sure you know
our reputation.

126
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,468
[ERIS gasps, screams]

127
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,262
Eris! Good,
you're awake. This is...

128
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,722
No. You're...

129
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,349
You're a... Superd!

130
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,810
Somebody help me! No!

131
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,979
I don't want to die!

132
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,147
Where's Ghislaine?
I want Ghislaine!

133
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,358
Please come back,
I don't wanna die!

134
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,819
I'm sorry, Rudeus, I'm so sorry!

135
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,487
I'm sorry I pushed you away!

136
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,866
Now I'll never get to keep
my promise to you! And I...

137
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:16,246
[cries]

138
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,415
[RUIJERD]
That's a normal reaction.

139
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,542
[RUDEUS]
So I'm the weird one?

140
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,712
[RUIJERD]
You are. But...

141
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,340
In a good way.

142
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,971
[ERIS]
It's n‐nice...

143
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,765
Nice to make your acquaintance.

144
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,686
I'm Eris Bo‐Bo‐Boreas Greyrat.

145
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,354
How do you do, sir?

146
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,441
Your name's Eris
Boboboreas Greyrat?

147
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,777
[ERIS]
No! It's "Boreas"!

148
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,988
I just stuttered a little!

149
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,161
[RUIJERD grunts]
Forgive me.

150
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,581
I'm Ruijerd, uh, Superdia.

151
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,709
[RUDEUS]
See? He's not so bad!

152
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,085
You just gotta communicate.

153
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,253
Huh?

154
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,590
Honestly, my mother
is such a liar!

155
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,760
She said a Superd would eat me
if I stayed up too late!

156
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,345
[RUDEUS] Oh, is that why
you hid under a blanket?

157
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,472
Don't make fun of me!

158
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,806
Ruijerd's kind of a loner,

159
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,726
so I bet he'd be
your friend if you asked.

160
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,022
I dunno.

161
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,566
[RUDEUS] Isn't that right?
What do you say?

162
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,902
Uh. Of course.

163
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,696
If you like. I'd appreciate it.

164
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,617
Well. Yes! If you insist!

165
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,495
I suppose I can be your friend!

166
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,038
[RUDEUS] That was all
it took to break through

167
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,332
the last of her defenses.

168
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,876
She's back to the Eris
we know and love,

169
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,004
but even when she's rude,
he just brushes it off.

170
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,881
Whoever said the Superd
have short tempers

171
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,634
was clearly full of it.

172
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,345
We'll get our
bearings tomorrow.

173
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,139
But I know we have
a tough road ahead of us.

174
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,772
[RUDEUS] I have to get her home
if it's the last thing I do.

175
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,711
Look at all that!
Let's get to adventuring!

176
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,351
[RUIJERD] I thought I
told you to stay put.

177
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,771
How come you always know exactly
where the monsters will be?

178
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,524
[RUIJERD] I can see them
with the eye in my forehead.

179
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,942
That's handy!

180
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,154
[RUIJERD] I've wished many times
that I didn't have it at all.

181
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,281
[ERIS] Well, I'll take it
if you don't want it!

182
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,365
Lemme yank it out!

183
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,284
[RUIJERD]
I can't do that.

184
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,328
[RUDEUS]
I hope she's joking.

185
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,872
If I had a sword, I could
totally help you fight!

186
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:49,250
And I'm sure the magic
I know could be pretty useful.

187
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,920
[RUIJERD] Don't concern
yourselves with combat.

188
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,923
I want you and your big brother
to stay out of harm's way.

189
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,633
[ERIS]
Excuse me?

190
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,344
I'm way older than
he is, you got that?

191
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,137
[RUIJERD]
Oh, uh. Apologies.

192
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,431
[RUDEUS]
Oof. Poor Ruijerd.

193
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,432
[gasps]

194
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,268
[RUIJERD]
There it is.

195
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,728
[ERIS]
A village!

196
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,912
Rudeus! What's going
on over there?

197
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,163
He doesn't want to let us in

198
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,916
because you and I
are too suspicious.

199
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,634
He'll fetch an authority.

200
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,302
The chief is sure to let you in.

201
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,512
[RUDEUS sighs]

202
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,023
Telepathy.

203
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:57,193
The Migurd tribe can speak
with each other at a distance.

204
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,028
Did you say Migurd?

205
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,625
[RUDEUS] Hell yeah,
Demon‐God paying off!

206
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,919
My name is Rokkus,
I'm the elder.

207
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,130
But wait. However
did you come by

208
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,424
that pendant you're
wearing, young man?

209
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,801
[RUDEUS]
And of course he speaks Human.

210
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,511
My master gave this to me.

211
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,222
Really? And who was that?

212
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,099
Oh, her name is Roxy!

213
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:41,988
Eh?

214
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,451
[RUDEUS]
Is this her freakin' hometown?

215
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:58,796
[gasps] Rudeus! Come look at the
weird thing guarding the fields!

216
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,173
That's so cool!

217
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,051
Their houses are
giant tortoise shells!

218
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,554
[RUDEUS]
One Roxy.

219
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,681
Two Roxys.

220
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,725
Three Roxys.

221
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,021
My goddess. This is heaven.

222
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,071
[RUDEUS gasps]
Twenty years?

223
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,174
[RUDEUS]
M‐‐Mm‐hmm.

224
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,525
That's a good dad.

225
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,446
[RUDEUS] I kinda wonder
if Paul and the others

226
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,740
are that worried about us.

227
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,997
[ROKKUS]
A mana disaster.

228
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,166
I suppose that accounts
for the shooting stars

229
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,335
flying every which
way last night.

230
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,504
I wondered what had gone awry.

231
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,465
[RUDEUS]
Thank you for sheltering us.

232
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:28,636
[ROKKUS] Hmm. What could
have triggered that?

233
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,907
[ROKKUS]
My, aren't you two close?

234
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,492
Yeah, we are.

235
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,743
So, tell me.

236
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,496
How do you intend to
make your way back home?

237
00:15:55,538 --> 00:16:00,209
I'm going to escort them.
I refuse to leave them alone.

238
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:03,588
Have you thought that through?
You're only so useful.

239
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,883
What do you mean by that?
I can navigate and fight.

240
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,926
I'm more than capable
of protecting them.

241
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,721
In the wild.
But you can't enter cities.

242
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,640
Huh? Wait a sec, is that true?

243
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,352
If they needed help,
I'd force my way in.

244
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,483
Even if I had to kill
everyone inside to find them.

245
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,069
As expected.

246
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,948
There's simply no reasoning with
you when children are involved.

247
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,950
What has it been, ten years now?

248
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,453
Since you saved one
of our little ones?

249
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,417
I know your goal
is important to you,

250
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,793
but surely you
won't accomplish it

251
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,962
through such violent means.

252
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,215
[RUDEUS]
Umm.

253
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,926
If you don't mind,
what goal is that?

254
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,221
To restore his tribe's honor.

255
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,598
He wants to convince everyone
that the Superd aren't

256
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,100
the iniquitous monsters
they're made out to be.

257
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,560
[gasps]

258
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,356
[RUDEUS]
Well. Good luck.

259
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,983
If Roxy and Eris
are any indication,

260
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,902
fear of the Superd
is deeply ingrained

261
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,779
in this world's culture.

262
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,865
How can one guy expect
to change that on his own?

263
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,243
[RUDEUS] I see how rumors
can get out of hand,

264
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,994
but it's true that
the Superd turned on

265
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,788
their allies
during the war, right?

266
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,708
[RUIJERD]
We did not! That's a lie.

267
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,338
We were victims
of the devil Laplace.

268
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,593
So. What happened?

269
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,513
He repaid our loyalty
with betrayal.

270
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,142
Do you mind telling me more?

271
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,315
[RUDEUS] So he did.
And the story he told

272
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:49,902
revealed a hidden, tragic side
of this world's history.

273
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,530
[RUDEUS]
A new weapon?

274
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,449
[RUIJERD] Yes. Before invading
the Central Continent,

275
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,619
he presented us with new spears.

276
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,455
Many of my warriors
objected at first.

277
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,666
We had our own,
and a Superd's spear

278
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,460
is their very soul,
so why abandon it?

279
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,716
[RUDEUS] Four hundred years ago,
the hero Laplace fought

280
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,135
to unify demonkind
and win rights

281
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,429
the humans had long denied them.

282
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,265
The Superd were some of
his earliest supporters.

283
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,351
So eventually, Ruijerd
and his men accepted

284
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,936
the spears they were awarded.

285
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,105
[RUIJERD]
They were incredibly powerful.

286
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:29,692
We were nearly
invincible in battle.

287
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,945
But they were corrupting us.

288
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,742
[RUIJERD] Before we knew it,
we lost the ability

289
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,244
to distinguish friend from foe.

290
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,288
And we showed no mercy.

291
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,791
Somehow, we couldn't recognize
the change in each other.

292
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,086
The mere thought of
bloodshed brought us joy.

293
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,047
Soon enough...

294
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:55,885
If anyone crossed our path,
they were cut down.

295
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,721
And then we were lured home.

296
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,723
There were no survivors.

297
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:05,311
Parents, spouses,
siblings, children.

298
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,606
In our madness,
we slaughtered our own families.

299
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,654
So here we are.

300
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,448
This spear is all
that's left of my son.

301
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,826
He sacrificed himself
to save me from that curse.

302
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:26,666
Our infamy is our punishment
for foolishly trusting a devil.

303
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,377
It's not my fault,
but all the same,

304
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,796
I brought shame to my tribe.

305
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,297
I will not rest.

306
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,383
As the leader of our warriors,

307
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,761
I want to tell our story
and clear our names.

308
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,603
[RUDEUS]
Four hundred years.

309
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,314
Has he been alone ever since?

310
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,484
Driven by bitterness and misery.

311
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,653
Fighting with his own regret.

312
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,827
[RUDEUS]
I know how that goes.

313
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,290
[RUDEUS]
I understand.

314
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,209
And maybe having
a human child on your side

315
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,837
could open up some
new possibilities.

316
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:19,301
[RUDEUS]
So if you'll let me. I promise.

317
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,179
I'll do whatever
it takes to help you.

318
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,514
[gasps]

319
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,143
Thank you.

320
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,242
You're Master's mother?

321
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,049
[ROKARI gasps]

322
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,183
[RUDEUS]
Okay.

323
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,812
[gasps]

324
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,655
Goodbye. And thank you
for your kindness!

325
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,047
[RUDEUS]
Here we go. Just us and Ruijerd.

326
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,300
[RUDEUS] The old me probably
would have laughed off

327
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,761
his sob story and
been done with it.

328
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,891
[RUDEUS] But he really struck
a chord with me last night.

329
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:53,020
And it feels safe
to trust him. So I will.

330
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,232
[RUDEUS]
He'll protect us on the road.

331
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,777
We'll protect him in the cities.
We'll rely on each other.

332
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:07,576
[RUDEUS] Ruijerd? I'm really
glad to have you with us.

333
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:08,744
[RUIJERD]
Thanks.
