Huh?

00:00:55,013 --> 00:01:00,102
[gasps] Get out, you degenerate!

00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:21,206
[MAN] Shit. The hell
did I do to deserve this?

00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,583
[NANAHOSHI]
Would you give it a rest?

00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,002
Don't be such a child!
You're wrong. So‐‐

[RUDEUS gasps]

13
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,191
[RUDEUS] I'd been making figures
to practice earth magic.

14
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,652
Guess I ran out of MP
and passed out.

15
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,112
My mana has grown a lot,

16
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:55,741
but I should learn to be
more aware of my limits.

17
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,492
That's enough.

18
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,994
And speaking of "enough."

19
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,996
[RUDEUS]
They're really going at it.

20
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:05,292
Let's hope for a little sister.
Little brothers are the worst.

21
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:08,253
It might be fun to head down
the hall to mess with them.

22
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:12,716
"Mommy? Daddy? What are
you doin' naked?" [chuckles]

23
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,177
I'd love to hear their excuses.

[PAUL, ZENITH moaning]

25
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,274
[RUDEUS] Roxy's in the
throes of adolescence.

26
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,776
As long as she didn't see me,

27
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,362
I'm classy enough to
pretend I didn't see her.

28
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,156
But I did enjoy that.

29
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,370
[RUDEUS] It's been six months
since Roxy got here.

30
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,954
She's a good teacher.

31
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,499
Her lessons are always
fun and engaging.

32
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,875
At this point,
I can use magic

33
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:50,087
at the Intermediate level
without breaking a sweat.

34
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,130
So, we've started doing
classroom‐style lessons

35
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,799
in the evenings as well.

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,134
But don't worry,
there's no sexy time involved.

37
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,261
I've been a perfect gentleman.

38
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,847
[ROXY] Magic manifested
thousands of years ago.

39
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,599
To defend themselves
from threats,

40
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:05,060
the tribes to the north
entreated the forest spirits

41
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,646
to grant them control
over wind and earth.

42
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,649
Modern magic began when
humans mimicked and reworked

43
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,152
the spells they saw in battle
during the war with demonkind.

44
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,613
[RUDEUS] So there's a whole
history to this and everything?

45
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,198
Of course.

46
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,784
[RUDEUS]
Honestly, I'd prefer sexy time.

47
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,953
History was never my thing.

48
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,121
That's really exciting, though,

49
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,706
I had no idea this
world had things like

50
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,125
spirits and demons and stuff!

51
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,334
Course it does.

52
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,670
And I'm a demon
myself, actually.

53
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,922
Whoa! That's awesome,
are you really?

54
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:34,965
Yes indeed.

55
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,092
Surely you remember how
surprised your parents were

56
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,677
to see me when we first met.

57
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,679
Yeah, that was because
you're so tiny, right?

58
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,681
I am not tiny!

59
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,852
But no, they were taken aback
by the color of my hair.

60
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,728
[RUDEUS]
How come?

61
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,396
You didn't know about demons,

62
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,524
so I take it you've never heard
of a race called the Superd?

63
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,736
I haven't. Are they
scary or something?

64
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,196
[ROXY] Yes. They're
a green‐haired race

65
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,115
from the Babynos Region.

66
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,616
Four hundred years ago,

67
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,036
they led a killing spree
during the Lahplace War.

68
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,205
After destroying their
enemies in battle,

69
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,291
they'd immediately
turn on their allies,

70
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,959
then slaughter the
women and children

71
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,420
left defenseless back at camp.

72
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,423
They became as despised
as they were violent.

73
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,508
After the war ended,
they were driven from

74
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,635
the Demon Continent entirely.

75
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,722
Considered too dangerous
to coexist with.

76
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,349
Growing up, I heard
about them all the time.

77
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,351
Mostly things like,
"Don't stay up too late,

78
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,438
or the Superd will
find you and gobble you up."

79
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,567
[RUDEUS] I guess every world
needs a good boogeyman.

80
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,652
[ROXY]
Anyway, pay attention:

81
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,362
They're fairly
easy to recognize,

82
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,407
they all have emerald green hair
and red gems in their foreheads.

83
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,534
So don't you dare go
anywhere near them.

84
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,037
If I do get too close,
will they kill me?

85
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,999
[ROXY] They might follow you
home and kill your whole family.

86
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,084
I'll be careful, then.

87
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,922
All that to say, my hair can
look green in the wrong light,

88
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,299
and people tend to
think the worst.

89
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,802
Well I think your hair
is real pretty, miss.

90
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,971
[gasps] That's sweet of you.

91
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,015
Someday you'll grow up
and find a girl you like,

92
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,392
so you should save
lines like that for her.

93
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,020
Maybe, but I like you
right now, miss!

94
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,983
[ROXY] I see. Well,
if you still feel that way

95
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,529
ten years from now,
feel free to say that again.

96
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,072
[RUDEUS]
Look at that.

97
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,366
I knew all those hours
I sunk into dating sims

98
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,659
wouldn't go to waste.

99
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,037
Better dust off those crappy
pickup lines from my old life.

100
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,622
They could be the
keys to the kingdom

101
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,583
in unlocking some
passionate "relations."

102
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,503
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

103
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,592
[ROXY]
The Superd will gobble you up.

104
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,011
[RUDEUS]
'Kay.

105
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,102
[RUDEUS] Roxy's been with us
for about a year, now.

106
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,362
[RUDEUS]
My steady practice has paid off.

107
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,531
Now, I never run out of mana.

108
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:09,286
I can use Advanced magic, and my
lessons are as smooth as butter.

109
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,370
On the other hand...

110
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,956
[PAUL]
It's a woosh and a slash!

111
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,501
That's basically it.
Give it a shot!

112
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,547
[RUDEUS] So step in
with a woosh and then...

113
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,840
Did I do it right?

114
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,217
[PAUL] No! That's stepping in
with a hop and wham,

115
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,802
stay light on your feet!

116
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,470
Remember it's woosh and slash!

117
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,347
[RUDEUS]
I'm still only four.

118
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,516
My body's not conditioned yet.

119
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,477
I have a long way to go,
but I got this.

120

[BOYS giggling]

121

[BOY 2B]
Hey, give it here!

00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,335

123
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:09,596
[STUDENTS laughing]

124
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,895
[ROXY] What are you doing
over there? You feeling okay?

125
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,272
[RUDEUS]
Yeah, everything's fine.

126
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,399
[BOYS laughing]

127
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,360
[BOY 2A]
Come on! Try to keep up!

128
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,654
[BOY 2B]
Whatever, I'm faster than you!

129
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,740
So, back in my village,
the climate was so harsh

130
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,992
that not even grass would grow.

131
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:34,204
It's hard to describe how
this scenery makes me feel.

132
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,505
You know, I hope you
get to stay with us forever.

133
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,716
I'm really lucky to have
a teacher as cool as you.

134
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,346
Look over there.

135
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,390
You see that mountain
range in the distance?

136
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,475
[RUDEUS] Are those
the Red Dragon Mountains?

137
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,228
[ROXY] That's right.
You've been studying hard.

138
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,898
[ROXY]
This is the Fittoa Region.

139
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,193
But beyond the mountains to the
north is a country called Ranoa.

140
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,570
[RUDEUS]
Huh. What's it like up there?

141
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,155
[ROXY]
It's always beautiful,

142
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,241
and it gets very cold
in the winter.

143
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,785
The snow can pile up
even taller than me.

144
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,078
[RUDEUS]
That sounds amazing.

145
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,372
I'd love to see it sometime.

146
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,749
It's also home to the
University of Magic,

147
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,335
the most prestigious
magic school there is.

148
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,880
They offer more advanced, modern
courses than anywhere else.

149
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,175
[RUDEUS]
School. Not my favorite word.

150
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,177
[ROXY] Not to mention they
happily accept students

151
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,096
from all different backgrounds.

152
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,973
There's no misplaced
sense of pride,

153
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,934
no discrimination
based on race or status.

154
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,022
Look. If you're interested in

155
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,149
furthering your
magical education,

156
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,276
I think you should go to Ranoa.

157
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,155
I would have to leave the house
before I could do that.

158
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,781
[ROXY]
Hm?

159
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:52,699
Nothing.

160
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,617
But... who cares about school?

161
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,662
You're the only master
I'll ever need, Miss Roxy.

162
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,208
You really shouldn't
call me that anymore.

163
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,336
At this rate, your skill
will easily surpass mine.

164
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,465
It's weird to call someone
inferior to you your "master."

165
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,468
I don't think it's
that weird at all.

166
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,345
Trust me, you'll understand
sooner or later.

167
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,290
[RUDEUS] Roxy's been living
with us for a year and a half.

168
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,125
And it turns out
birthdays aren't

169
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,836
an annual celebration
in this world.

170
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,380
Rather, we celebrate
larger milestones,

171
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,967
with one big party
every fifth birthday.

172
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,095
So you have food and
gifts to look forward to

173
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:59,849
at five, ten, and fifteen, when
you're considered an adult.

174
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,562
[ALL]
Well, Rudy. From us to you,

175
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,106
happy fifth birthday!

176
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,233
[gasps] Thank you all so much!

177
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,818
[PAUL laughs]

178
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,361
[RUDEUS] How long has
it been since anyone

179
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,321
cared about my birthday?

180
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,531
Since I became a recluse,

181
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,992
it's been less special than
a fry in your onion rings.

182
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,119
[ZENITH laughing]

183
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,622
[RUDEUS] I'd forgotten this
feeling. I kind of missed it.

184
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,623
[PAUL laughs]

185
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,709
[ALL laugh]

186
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,089
Happy birthday, little man.
This is for you.

187
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,638
This is great, Father,
thanks a lot.

188
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,974
Ahem. Now, then.

189
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:44,144
It's a little much for you right
now but let it be a symbol.

190
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:48,148
For a man must carry a sword in
his heart as well as on his hip.

191
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,399
It takes more than brute force

192
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,193
to defend the people
who are dearest to you.

193
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,404
You'll have a wife and kids
of your own someday,

194
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,406
and you'll need the
courage to protect them.

195
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,534
Think about that as you
grow into this weapon.

196
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,578
And don't think you can
always rely on magic

197
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,787
to get the job done!

198
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,914
It's flashy, but terrible
in close combat,

199
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,792
and you'll never keep up
in fast‐paced battles.

200
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,254
However, learn the Sword
God Style, and you‐‐

201
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,882
‐‐Enough!
‐‐[ROXY chuckles]

202
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,176
I've been excited
about this one.

203
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,721
Look! I know how much
you like books.

204
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,100
This is perfect,
Mother, thank you!

205
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,060
It's exactly what I wanted!

206
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,606
[ZENITH squeals]
You're such a good boy!

207
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,524
[ZENITH giggles]

208
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,695
[ROXY]
And from me.

209
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,619
[ROXY]
Your very own wand.

210
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,037
I crafted it yesterday.

211
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,706
That Magic Stone
will amplify your mana.

212
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,000
It's so beautiful.

213
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,753
It's a typical gift for
mastering Elementary magic,

214
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,047
so I should have given
you this a lot sooner,

215
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,550
but you could already use it, so
it completely slipped my mind.

216
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,260
My apologies.

217
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,930
That's all right,
thank you very much.

218
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,351
I'll take good care
of it, Master.

219
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,650
You learned four types of
Advanced attack magic

220
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,318
before you turned five.

221
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,779
You've earned the right to be
a little arrogant, you know.

222
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,615
[RUDEUS]
Mm‐mm. No way.

223
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,451
I only got here 'cause
you taught me so well.

224
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,039
Be that as it may, I'm afraid
there's almost nothing left

225
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,708
I can offer that will
be of any use to you.

226
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,751
Huh?

227
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:38,633
And so, tomorrow is
your graduation exam.

228
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,512
[RUDEUS]
Graduation?

229
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,183
[RUDEUS] Every time I think
about leaving the house,

230
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:50,228
it comes flooding back.

231
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,896
[STUDENTS laughing]

232
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,274
[RUDEUS]
Regret. Despair.

233
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,651
I remember it
like it was yesterday.

234
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:00,321
When I was depressed or angry,
I had a few go‐to fantasies.

235
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,657
I thought if suddenly
I gained amazing powers,

236
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,410
or some hot girl showed up
in need of help,

237
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,869
surely I would
rise to the occasion.

238
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,789
[STUDENTS]
Limp dick!

239
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:13,918
[RUDEUS] And one of those
dreams actually came true.

240
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,629
But what if it ends
when I step outside?

241
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,425
[FATHER]
Keep your chin up! Be brave!

242
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,847
[RUDEUS]
I know this is all real now,

243
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,017
and I promised myself
I'd get serious,

244
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,602
but my body won't cooperate.

245
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,229
I want to cry.

246
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,981
Who's a good horse?

247
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,482
[RUDEUS]
How far are we going?

248
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,484
[ROXY]
The other side of the village.

249
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,154
[RUDEUS] We can't just
do it in here the garden?

250
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,196
We cannot.

251
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,615
[RUDEUS]
Are you sure?

252
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,285
Rudy's never been too
keen on venturing out.

253
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,995
Maybe he's scared of monsters.

254
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,040
As long as we stay away from
the forest, we'll be fine.

255
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,834
It's unusual to run into
monsters around these parts.

256
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,586
And even if you do,
they're all pretty weak.

257
00:13:56,627 --> 00:14:00,006
Come here, kiddo.
I promise Caravaggio's gentle.

258
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,174
Huh?

259
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:07,263
[chuckles] It's the horse
you're afraid of, isn't it?

260
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,099
I'm really not
that scared of horses.

261
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:15,646
[chuckles] Wow. You always act
your age when I least expect it.

262
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,024
Upsy‐daisy.

263
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,611
There. Once we get moving,

264
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,072
you'll see there's
nothing to worry about.

265
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,538
Master, no, I can't!

266
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,374
Time to be brave, Rudy.

267
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,043
Everything's gonna be fine.
I'm right here.

268
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:43,383
[ZENITH]
Good luck, Rudy! We love you!

269
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:47,136

271
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,979
You see now? We're both okay.

00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,148
[VILLAGER 2A]
Huh?

273
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,359
[RUDEUS]
Don't look at me like that.

274
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,908
[RUDEUS]
Why are you staring? Cut it out.

275
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,910
[VILLAGER 2B]
Thanks again for the other day.

276
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,286
Sure thing!

277
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,166
[RUDEUS]
They're not staring at me.

278
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,793
Mornin', Roxy, how are ya?

279
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,420
[ROXY]
Good morning.

280
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,172
[RUDEUS]
They're all looking at Roxy.

281
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,258
[ROXY]
Caravaggio is in a good mood.

282
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,927
I think he's happy that
you're riding him, Rudy.

283
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,929
You really think so?

284
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,143
How do you feel now?
Are you still nervous?

285
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,270
No, I actually feel pretty good.

286
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,648
[RUDEUS] And just like that,
I had nothing to fear.

287
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,608
Why did I think anyone
would mock me

288
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,777
in a peaceful village like this?

289
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:45,903
[VILLAGER 2H]
How do you do?

290
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,655
[BOTH]
How do you do, ma'am!

291
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,615
[RUDEUS]
Roxy's amazing.

292
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,243
I'm sure she faced
prejudice at first.

293
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,163
But now she's a beloved
member of our community.

294
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,290
[RUDEUS] It's a nice
village, huh, Master?

295
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,042
[ROXY] Yes. I've become
quite fond of it.

296
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,509
This looks like a good spot.

297
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,475
[RUDEUS]
It feels great out here!

298
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:19,228
I'm going to use the Saint‐Class
Water spell Cumulonimbus.

299
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,773
I can only cast it once.

300
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,777
So watch closely,
then attempt it on your own.

301
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,362
That is your final exam.

302
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:32,074
Are we doing this away from town
because it's a secret spell?

303
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,243
[ROXY]
No. We're here to make sure

304
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,913
we don't hurt anyone
or damage crops.

who rules the heavens.

and bless me with thy savagery!

Reveal thy might to this
insignificant servant.

Strike awe with a blow of
thy divine hammer on the anvil,

311
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,903
and cover the land in water!

312
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,571
Now come, O rain!

313
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,450
Sweep all else away in
thy flood of destruction!

314
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,620
Cumulonimbus!

315

317
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:34,262
[ROXY]
No! What should I do now?

318
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,347
[RUDEUS] Cast a healing
spell, Master! Hurry!

319
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,808
[ROXY]
Y‐Yes! Yes, of course!

320
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,479
[ROXY]
That was a close one.

321
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,482
May I ask that you keep this
a secret from your parents?

322
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,569
You don't need to worry,
I promise I won't say a thing.

323
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,029
[sighs] I appreciate that.

324
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,076
Now! Your turn, Rudy!

325
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,704
I'll be sure to keep
Caravaggio safe!

326

[ROXY]
Earth Fortress.

327
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,593
[RUDEUS]
My final exam.

328
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,846
Which I suppose marks
the end of my home tutoring.

329
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,807
O, spirits of the
magnificent waters

330
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,768
and imperial prince of lightning
who rules the heavens.

331
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,437
I beseech thee to
grant my wish...

332
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,023
[RUDEUS] If I know Roxy,
she'll say something like,

333
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,860
"I can't impose on you when I
have nothing left to teach."

334
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,779
She may insist on
leaving tomorrow.

335
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,532
Making this our
last day together.

336
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,285
Look at that.

337
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,329
Now come, O rain.

338
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,747
Wash everything away...

339
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,291
[RUDEUS] I wish I had
gotten to know her better.

340
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,377
Cumulonimbus!

341
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,735
[ROXY] I don't remember
telling you to make it

342
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,029
bigger than my
own demonstration.

343
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,198
Sorry if I overdid it.

344
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,866
It's kind of bittersweet.

345
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:19,992
[RUDEUS gasps]

346
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:23,162
In two years, you learned what
took me a lifetime to perfect,

347
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,498
so I have nothing left to teach.

348
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,633
I'm proud of you, Rudy.

349
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:39,428
Congratulations. You're a
Saint‐Class Water mage.

350
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,029
Roxy. You're more than
welcome to stay here!

351
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,115
I still have plenty of
recipes to teach you!

352
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,116
Yeah, don't go!

353
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,201
The villagers would love
to have you around.

354
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,286
It's very kind of you to offer.

355
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,747
But I'd like to travel
the world for a little while

356
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,583
and continue to hone
my magical abilities.

357
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,961
I see. Well, in that case.

358
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,463
My apologies. I hate that
our son made you

359
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,465
lose confidence in yourself.

360
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,260
[RUDEUS] That's a real garbage
way of putting that, Paul.

361
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,805
Rudy. I hope you know I
did the very best I could.

362
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,891
But I lack the ability to
guide someone of your caliber.

363
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,518
That's not true at all.

364
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,813
You gave me more than I ever
could have asked for, Master.

365
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:34,692
[gasps]

366
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,319
[gasps]

367
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,863
[ROXY]
Hang on.

368
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,952
What is this?

369
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,037
[ROXY]
It's an amulet from my village.

370
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,291
I wanted to give you something
to commemorate your graduation.

371
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,042
I hope this is enough.

372
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,088
I'll treasure it forever!

373
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,758
I was hoping you'd say
something like that.

374
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,471
I'd better get going.

375
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,143
'Til next time.

376
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,622
Master!

377
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,044
Thank you for everything!

378
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,799
[RUDEUS] I'm grateful.
She really did give me so much.

379
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,259
Knowledge, experience,
technique.

380
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:46,096
But most importantly,
she brought me outside.

381
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,307
Such a simple thing.

382
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,059
But powerful.

383
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,102
She did something
no one had been able to do

384
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,396
in over 20 years.

385
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,940
She helped heal me.

386
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,151
I know she'll never understand
what that means to me.

387
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,823
[RUDEUS]
Still. As long as I live,

388
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,200
I'm gonna respect that girl.

389
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,580
[RUDEUS]
Oh, wait.

390
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:12,998
I still have
a pair of her panties

391
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,042
I stole a few months ago.

392
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,086
My bad, Roxy.
