1
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,388
[ERIS]
This sword is amazing!

2
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,683
[RUDEUS gasps]
Eris, you know you can leave

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,228
some of them for me
to handle, right?

4
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,273
Sorry, what'd you say?

5
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,617
This is a dream come true!

6
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,621
I love living like this!

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,383
[RUDEUS]
Guh. I miss beef.

8
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,636
What's a guy gotta do
for a burger around here?

9
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,396
Look there.

10
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,690
[ERIS, RUDEUS gasp]

11
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:18,453
[RUIJERD] Beyond those cliffs
is the city of Rikarisu.

12
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,426
[RUDEUS]
Lizard guy? Koala guy? Whoa.

13
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,612
Rudeus, are you seeing this?
They're all so crazy‐lookin'!

14
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,114
I expected most demons
to look like humans,

15
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:57,075
like the Migurd and Superd,
but I guess that's not the case.

16
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,162
Yes, there are many different
tribes across the continent.

17
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,371
What's "Dead End"?

18
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,206
They all seem
pretty scared of it.

19
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,625
[RUIJERD]
That would be me.

20
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,584
Huh?

21
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,627
Say wha?

22
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,630
[RUIJERD] That's how some
refer to me these days.

23
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,256
[RUDEUS gasps]

24
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,342
[RUDEUS]
That's a little much, isn't it?

25
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,261
But I guess they do think
he's a mass murderer.

26
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,472
So what do we do now?

27
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,183
Go without me.

28
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,726
I'll leap over the cliffs
and meet you inside.

29
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,686
Hang on!

30
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,563
You can't just drop down
on their heads like that,

31
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:27,981
the whole city is gonna freak!

32
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,691
You got a better idea?

33
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,526
[RUDEUS groans]

34
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,374
[RUDEUS]
Yes, I do! Come here a sec.

35
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,146
[ERIS gasps]

36
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,443
Ta‐da!

37
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,902
It's cute on you.

38
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,030
[ERIS] Thanks, Rudeus!
I'll take good care of it!

39
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,215
Okay, we all need to
keep our eyes peeled

40
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,425
for the Adventurers' Guild.

41
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,510
Are we gonna join?
I really wanna!

42
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,762
Yeah, that's part of the plan,

43
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,097
we gotta make money
somehow, don't we?

44
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,476
So let's go! Today we
become adventurers!

45
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,352
[ERIS]
All right!

46
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,146
Don't fall behind, Ruijerd!

47
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,316
This is where it gets serious.

48
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,109
Yes, right.

49
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:46,161
[DEMONS chattering]

50
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,372
[DEMON GOAT 10A laughs]

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,376
[ALL]
Huh?

52
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,184
Uh...

53
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,728
[RUDEUS chuckles]

54
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,303
[DEMON DOGS laugh]

55
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,890
[DEMONS laugh]

56
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,934
[PERTOKO laughs]

57
00:05:56,398 --> 00:06:03,113
[ALL laughing]

58
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,205
Now, for your party name.

59
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,374
Are you sure you want
to go with "Dead End"?

60
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,710
I've never been more
sure about anything.

61
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,837
[PERTOKO laughs]

62
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,925
All newly‐formed parties
start at F rank.

63
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,969
Remember, you can
only accept jobs

64
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:29,264
within one rank of
your own. Understand?

65
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,640
Yes.

66
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:36,354
[ERIS] Now I'm an adventurer
for real! Let's go, Rudeus!

67
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,863
I can't read this!

68
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,074
[RUDEUS] What's the
highest‐paying gig we can get?

69
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,953
The monster‐hunting jobs
start at Rank C.

70
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,665
We'd have to get promoted
twice first. That's a shame.

71
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,027
[laughs]

72
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,739
Why did we even register if you
weren't gonna take any jobs?

73
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,492
I thought we would be out there
slaying dragons already!

74
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,828
We'll work our way
up to dragons.

75
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,205
Today was successful
enough on its own.

76
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,374
How do you figure?
Please explain.

77
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,210
We introduced you as Dead End,
and everybody there laughed

78
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,337
instead of screaming
or running away.

79
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,631
That's progress.

80
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,466
And now the fun begins.

81
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,802
I know we're pretending
you're Migurdian for now,

82
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,680
but if "Dead End" the party
starts doing good deeds,

83
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:37,642
that ought to help "Dead End"
the Superd regain his honor.

84
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,978
But don't lose that, all right?

85
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,022
It was a gift from my master.

86
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,606
I expect it back.

87
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,941
Right.

88
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,068
[ERIS gasps]

89
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,620
[ERIS]
It's so pretty!

90
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,999
I've never seen anything
like it! [laughs]

91
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,418
I vote we find a place to sleep.

92
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,670
We're gonna be really busy soon.

93
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,131
Indeed. Let's go.

94
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,734
[gasps] Don't touch me!

95
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,115
[ERIS]
You. You'll pay for that!

96
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,333
This is the first
piece of clothing

97
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,919
that Rudeus ever
bought for me, you jerk!

98
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,297
Eris, that's enough!
Down girl! Heel!

99
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:58,908
[RUDEUS] Eh... Something about
this makes me feel itchy.

100
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,707
[RUDEUS sighs] Hey. I'll mend
that for you tomorrow.

101
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,250
You mean it?

102
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,424
[RUDEUS]
All right, next steps.

103
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:18,094
First and foremost,
we need money.

104
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,722
The inn is 15 stone
pieces a night,

105
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,266
which the low‐rank jobs
will barely cover.

106
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:27,437
With food and supplies,
we'll be broke in two weeks.

107
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,648
Heh. Look at me,
fretting over the family budget.

108
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,026
Never thought I'd see the day.

109
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,700
[chuckles]

110
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,747
[RUDEUS]
Again? What do you want now?

111
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,373
[MAN‐GOD]
I'm so proud!

112
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,002
You took my advice and Ruijerd
got you to the nearest city!

113
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,172
Ha. He would have
protected us anyway.

114
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,300
Even if we'd run.
That's just the kinda guy he is.

115
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,386
My goodness, it certainly
sounds like you trust him.

116
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,932
So, why are you still
so suspicious of me?

117
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,935
[RUDEUS] Really?
I thought that was obvious.

118
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,480
[MAN‐GOD chuckles]
Oh well.

119
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,232
I have some more
advice for you anyway.

120
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,651
[RUDEUS]
Yeah, whatever. Make it quick.

121
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,570
[MAN‐GOD]
Come on, lighten up a little!

122
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,281
[RUDEUS] I hate this place
and I hate this body.

123
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,493
And I hate your stupid voice,
so let's get this over with.

124
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,703
Ugh, well, you're no fun.

125
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,456
[RUDEUS] I'm already
in the palm of your hand.

126
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,209
Don't be silly.
You can ignore me!

127
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,878
What you do next
is all up to you!

128
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,713
[RUDEUS]
Enough, spit it out.

129
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,465
I hear you.

130
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,635
[clears throat] Rudeus.

131
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,930
Accept the E‐rank job
to find a lost kitten.

132
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,807
Soon enough,
you'll find yourself

133
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,977
with much less to worry about.

134
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,614
[RUDEUS] Finding lost kittens
can't pay that much.

135
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,366
What are they thinking?

136
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,207
[RUDEUS]
Can't sleep?

137
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,458
Yeah.

138
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,298
[ERIS]
Hey. Rudeus?

139
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,757
[RUDEUS]
Hm?

140
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,760
[ERIS] Do you think we'll
actually make it home?

141
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,435
We'll make it.

142
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,855
[ERIS] And Ghislaine and
Grandfather will be okay, right?

143
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,274
[RUDEUS]
Yeah. Absolutely.

144
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:51,414
[RUDEUS] Here, kitty!
Where are ya? Kitty!

145
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,838
Are you sure we're headed
in the right direction?

146
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,923
Positive. Just stay behind me.

147
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,801
Are you using your third eye?

148
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,512
[RUIJERD]
Yes. Look.

149
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,765
There are signs
of a struggle here.

150
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,021
I can't tell what
you're looking at.

151
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,482
[RUIJERD]
This way.

152
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,321
In there.

153
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,035
[ERIS] This whole place
stinks like a farm!

154
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,620
[RUDEUS]
Anybody home?

155
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,290
[RUIJERD] No people. But many
other living creatures.

156
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,834
[RUDEUS] Sounds like we'd
better be careful, then.

157
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,135
What is this creepy place?

158
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,017
Found it.

159
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,315
[RUDEUS]
Huh? That's no kitten.

160
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,360
I guess everything's bigger
on the Demon Continent.

161
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,822
[RUDEUS] Do you think
all of them are pets?

162
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,699
Someone's coming.

163
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,826
Huh?

164
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,022
[ALL gasp]

165
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,908
[RUDEUS sighs] A sneak attack
always does the trick.

166
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,995
But we totally just fought
like a real team, didn't we?

167
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,746
Yeah, we did.

168
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,007
[RUDEUS]
Okay, uh...

169
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,854
[RUDEUS]
Damn. Someone teach this idiot

170
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,856
not to assault his captors.

171
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,525
He doesn't want
to make us angry.

172
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:41,751
[BOTH screaming]

173
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,594
Ruijerd. Why did you...?

174
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:55,139
[RUIJERD] Hm? Because he
injured a child, of course.

175
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,727
You. You shouldn't kill.

176
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,605
Why not? He hurt you.

177
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,858
That's no excuse.
How can you just‐‐?

178
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,075
[RUDEUS] Listen. You can't
do that anymore, okay?

179
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,201
[RUIJERD]
Why?

180
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:18,371
I... If you walk around
executing people,

181
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,790
it'll make the Superd's
reputation worse!

182
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,959
Even if they're evil?

183
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,211
[RUDEUS] People won't care
who you killed!

184
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,129
Just that you killed them!

185
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,756
That sounds foolish.

186
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,424
[gasps]

187
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,847
What's with you?

188
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,599
Stop arguing with
our party leader!

189
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,226
[RUIJERD] He's still
too young to understand

190
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,435
that I did the right thing.

191
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:45,314
That kind of attitude is
why people don't like you!

192
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:49,151
[RUDEUS] Please. Don't kill
anyone from here on out.

193
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,445
Prove that the Superd
aren't monsters.

194
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:57,118
Okay? Eris and I don't want
to be afraid of you, either.

195
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,273
I get it now.

196
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,774
[RUIJERD]
I told you. Villains.

197
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,652
[RUDEUS]
Wha‐‐ Hey, cool your jets!

198
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:38,409
[RUDEUS]
Now what? Think. Think.

199
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,475
I thought so.

200
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,865
You want to join forces?
You can't be serious.

201
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,950
I know what I'm doing.

202
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,786
Would you please
be quiet for a moment?

203
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,745
[RUIJERD]
What?

204
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:26,165
Working together, we can
earn more money, faster.

205
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,459
And they can help us
improve your reputation.

206
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,628
Don't be absurd!

207
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,881
I refuse to depend on
lowlifes such as these!

208
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,593
[ERIS]
Let go of him!

209
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,471
[ERIS]
What's your problem?

210
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,889
[RUIJERD]
I don't like villains.

211
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,141
[ERIS] Oh, boo‐hoo,
quit complaining!

212
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,309
Who cares if you don't like it,

213
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,395
he's doing all of
this for our sake!

214
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,396
[RUIJURD]
Huh?

215
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,649
What's so "villainous" about
kidnapping a few stupid animals?

216
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,776
They also kicked a child.

217
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,863
So what? I kick people
all the time!

218
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,532
Evildoers can't be trusted.

219
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,658
Yeah, well you've done some

220
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,451
pretty evil stuff,
too, haven't you?

221
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,577
[RUIJERD gasps]

222
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,288
[ERIS]
Rudeus is really smart, okay?

223
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,916
He's going to make sure
everything works out fine!

224
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,210
So just shut up
and do what he says!

225
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,461
If you don't like it,
then leave,

226
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,797
we can make it home without you!

227
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:21,429
[RUDEUS]
Eris. That's enough, please.

228
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,141
[RUIJERD]
I'm a Superd warrior.

229
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,227
I have never once
gone back on my word.

230
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,480
I will see you home
safely no matter what.

231
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:34,900
[RUDEUS]
I know.

232
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,831
Ooh, how much is it?

233
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:15,376
[NOKOPARA laughs]
