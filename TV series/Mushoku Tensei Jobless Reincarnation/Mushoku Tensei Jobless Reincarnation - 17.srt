1
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:23,596
[NORN]
Daddy. Daddy?

2
00:00:31,688 --> 00:00:34,983
I don't know where Mommy,
Aisha, and the house are.

3
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:54,836
Where the hell are we?

4
00:00:57,255 --> 00:01:01,676
[PAUL]
Zenith? Lilia? Aisha?

5
00:01:03,928 --> 00:01:07,474
All right, think.
What could've caused this?

6
00:01:08,683 --> 00:01:11,144
Was it that storm?

7
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:12,771
[NORN]
What's wrong?

8
00:01:16,274 --> 00:01:21,279
Nothing, sweetheart.
Come on. Let's hurry home.

9
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:45,715
[GEESE humming]

10
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:55,975
[GEESE]
Hey! There you are!

11
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:58,186
[gasps] Geese, you bastard!

12
00:03:58,269 --> 00:03:59,437
Where the hell have you been?

13
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:03,692
Ooh, hostile! You're as
pissy as ever, I see.

14
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:05,276
Heh.

15
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,528
[GEESE]
'Scuse me!

16
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:08,988
I'll take one of
whatever he's got.

17
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:10,532
[WAITRESS 17A]
You got it.

18
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:11,741
[GEESE]
Paul.

19
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:14,661
You might wanna swing by
the Guild tomorrow.

20
00:04:14,744 --> 00:04:16,037
And why would I?

21
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:19,040
You might bump into
a familiar face!

22
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:23,920
Hm? Seriously, though,
what the hell

23
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:26,131
happened to you
while I was gone?

24
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:28,258
[PAUL]
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

25
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:29,759
Get real, man.

26
00:04:29,843 --> 00:04:32,679
The guy I know would never
get this cranky over "nothing."

27
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:39,477
Come on, pouty pants, what's up?
You can tell me.

28
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:44,274
So that's it, is it?

29
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:47,485
I know it ain't my place,

30
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,571
but aren't you expecting
too much from the boy?

31
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:52,532
Huh? Really? From him?

32
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:56,494
Oh, please. Yes!
Think about it for a sec.

33
00:04:57,537 --> 00:05:00,623
[GEESE] Look, I'll grant you
that Rudeus is impressive.

34
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:03,543
I mean, I've never seen anyone
cast spells without speaking.

35
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:04,878
That's what I've been saying.

36
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:07,255
He's unbelievable.
He was only five when--

37
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:08,673
I'm not done!

38
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:11,760
At the end of the day,
he's still an 11-year-old kid.

39
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:15,263
Now remind me again what is it
you were doing at that age?

40
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:16,639
Why do you care?

41
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:19,642
If I told you to survive
the Demon Continent at 11,

42
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:21,269
think you could do it?

43
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:25,190
[PAUL] Ha. Sure. Long as
I had the same handicaps.

44
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:29,235
Don't forget, he found himself
a Superd warrior bodyguard.

45
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,530
Anyone could have made it back
with a chaperone like that.

46
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:34,449
[GEESE]
Nope. Not a chance.

47
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:36,451
Hell, you couldn't do that now.

48
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:39,412
Ha. Doesn't that
just prove my point?

49
00:05:39,496 --> 00:05:41,873
He did something
I could never do!

50
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:44,542
And that means
my boy's a genius.

51
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:46,336
So excuse me for
expecting him to

52
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:48,672
put those talents to use
from time to time.

53
00:05:48,755 --> 00:05:51,174
You get that?
I'm not in the wrong here!

54
00:05:51,257 --> 00:05:53,218
[GEESE sighs]
Shut up, of course you are.

55
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:55,470
But hey, what else is new, huh?

56
00:05:56,805 --> 00:05:58,306
[PAUL]
What?

57
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,018
Tell me. You've never been to
the Demon Continent, have you?

58
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:03,687
[PAUL]
What's your point?

59
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:09,275
My point is, I grew up
in that wasteland.

60
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,443
[PAUL]
Huh?

61
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:12,946
And in my extremely
considered opinion,

62
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:15,657
you're taking the whole
place way too lightly.

63
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:19,119
You want to explain
what you mean by that?

64
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:20,370
I kinda have to.

65
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:21,788
You Central Continent softies

66
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:23,248
think you can
deal with anything,

67
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:25,291
but guess what, friend?

68
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,044
Outside of the towns,
that place is barren.

69
00:06:28,128 --> 00:06:31,506
Boiling during the day.
Freezing at night.

70
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:33,842
There's no water.
There's no rain.

71
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:35,635
And you have to
hunt and kill monsters

72
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:37,303
to use them for firewood.

73
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:39,055
Monsters which, I might add,

74
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:42,267
are way stronger than
anything you ever see here.

75
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,520
Please, now it just sounds like
you're making stuff up.

76
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:47,355
[GEESE] He's on
his very first adventure.

77
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,274
He's in an unfamiliar land.

78
00:06:49,357 --> 00:06:51,526
And his party includes
a Superd warrior,

79
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:54,487
for who all he knows,
could betray him at any moment.

80
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:55,864
There this teenage girl,

81
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:58,700
a hothead he's sworn
to have to protect.

82
00:06:58,783 --> 00:07:00,493
And you're being
judgy that he didn't

83
00:07:00,577 --> 00:07:02,746
comb the place for
survivors on top of that?

84
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:05,290
People have limits.
Especially children.

85
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:07,167
You get me?

86
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,585
Then riddle me this.

87
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:11,046
If it was as much of
a struggle as you say,

88
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:12,672
why would he try to
act like the whole trip

89
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:15,008
was some big, fun adventure?

90
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:18,303
Because he didn't wanna
worry dear ol' dad, obviously.

91
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:20,263
[PAUL]
Huh?

92
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:22,140
[GEESE sighs]

93
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:24,976
[PAUL] Why would he waste time
trying to protect me?

94
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,103
Am I that hopeless as a father?

95
00:07:27,187 --> 00:07:28,438
Pretty much.

96
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:31,024
Haven't seen any evidence
to the contrary.

97
00:07:31,107 --> 00:07:33,318
Ha. I guess you're right.

98
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:34,986
I mean, look at me!

99
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,821
Weak-willed and
drowning in booze

100
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:38,323
to ignore my own failures.

101
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:42,786
That must look real pathetic
to my little "prodigy," huh?

102
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:44,496
I don't think it takes
a prodigy to see

103
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:47,916
how pathetic you are
right now, Paul. Sorry.

104
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:57,175
[GEESE]
I pity the kid, though. I do!

105
00:07:57,258 --> 00:07:58,593
After a grueling journey,

106
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:01,012
he finally reunites
with his daddy,

107
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:02,889
only to find out
the guy's turned into

108
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:04,766
a total drunken loser!

109
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:06,434
Can you imagine?

110
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:07,602
I were him?

111
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:10,063
I'd have cut ties
with you on the spot.

112
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:15,485
[GEESE] Why can't you just be
happy to see him again?

113
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:18,571
Who cares what kind
of trip he's had?

114
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:21,741
Doesn't really matter
in the grand scheme of things.

115
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:25,078
He's here now, and he's safe.

116
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:27,872
That's worth
celebrating, isn't it?

117
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:31,334
[GEESE] Unless, of course,
you would've preferred for him

118
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:34,045
to come back dead-eyed
and missing a limb or two.

119
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:35,338
[PAUL gasps]

120
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:39,300
I'm just sayin',
revisit this sober.

121
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:02,741
[VIERRA]
Captain.

122
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:16,755
Daddy...

123
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:23,678
[RUDEUS]
Whoa! She's so cute!

124
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:27,307
I can't believe
how soft her cheeks are!

125
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,558
Father.

126
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:29,851
[gasps]

127
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:33,938
[RUDEUS]
You took too long to find me.

128
00:09:34,022 --> 00:09:35,815
Where were you?

129
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:38,193
I waited for so long.

130
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:41,029
Why would you
let this happen to me?

131
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:03,176
How 'bout that.
Maybe Geese was right.

132
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:27,784
[door opens]

133
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:30,912
[INNKEEPER 17A]
Hm? Come in.

134
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:33,665
[PAUL]
Uh. I-I'm...

135
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:38,503
[sighs]

136
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:42,257
What are you doing here?

137
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,344
I just came to talk to Rudy.
I'm his father, Paul.

138
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,096
[ERIS]
I know who you are!

139
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:51,307
Well how about that,

140
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:53,601
you got yourself
one devoted little lady friend!

141
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:56,646
[PAUL chuckles]
Knew I raised a playboy.

142
00:10:58,231 --> 00:11:00,692
You've got some nerve
showing your face here!

143
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:03,570
Do you have any idea
what you did to hi--?

144
00:11:03,653 --> 00:11:05,405
Hey, Ruijerd!
Let go of me at once!

145
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:07,365
I say we leave these two alone.

146
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:08,950
[ERIS]
You saw Rudeus last night!

147
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:11,619
That monster has
no right to speak to him!

148
00:11:11,703 --> 00:11:13,038
[RUIJERD]
Don't be so harsh.

149
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:16,124
Most fathers are
far from perfect.

150
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:18,752
You're welcome to air
all your grievances.

151
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:20,545
But the only reason you can

152
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:23,006
is that your son is
still alive to hear them.

153
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:25,133
Uh. Right.

154
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,656
[PAUL]
Was that your new demon friend?

155
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,036
Yes, sir. That's Ruijerd
of the Superd tribe.

156
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:57,040
Well, he certainly seems like
a nice enough guy to me.

157
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:58,917
He doesn't terrify you?

158
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,337
Don't be silly. He saved my son.

159
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:09,552
[RUDEUS]
So. Can I ask why you're here?

160
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:14,307
Well, uh, you know.
I wanted to apologize.

161
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:15,642
[RUDEUS]
For what?

162
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:17,227
[PAUL]
Yesterday.

163
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:22,357
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

164
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,650
You were right.

165
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:26,820
I've been treating this
whole thing like a game.

166
00:12:26,903 --> 00:12:29,447
It's only natural
that you'd be upset.

167
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,743
[RUDEUS] If anything, I should
apologize for messing around.

168
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:36,162
[PAUL]
No, no, don't say that.

169
00:12:36,246 --> 00:12:39,165
I know you three probably
had it rough out there.

170
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:42,669
[RUDEUS]
Not really. I had it easy.

171
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,634
That so? Well, then...

172
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:00,311
[RUDEUS]
Just so we're clear,

173
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:03,940
I do feel terrible that
I never saw your message.

174
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:05,483
What did it say?

175
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:09,279
[PAUL]
It said "Forget about me.

176
00:13:09,362 --> 00:13:12,073
Go search the northern
Central Continent."

177
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,200
[RUDEUS]
Ah.

178
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:27,339
[PAUL] Anyway, um.
What do you plan to do next?

179
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:32,010
[RUDEUS] What else?
I'm escorting Eris back home.

180
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:35,013
[PAUL]
There's nothing there anymore.

181
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,516
[PAUL]
No people, no towns.

182
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,102
It's all grassland now.

183
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:42,312
And I hate to say it,

184
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:45,106
but there's a chance
the Boreas family is...

185
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,817
We'll go anyway.

186
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:49,694
[PAUL gasps]
Are you--

187
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:57,035
[RUDEUS] After that, I'll look
for Mother, Lilia, and Aisha.

188
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:00,997
[PAUL]
I see.

189
00:14:14,177 --> 00:14:16,179
[INNKEEPER 17A]
This ones on me.

190
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:19,557
[RUDEUS]
Thank you very much.

191
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:21,184
Listen up, my boy.

192
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:23,728
I won't pretend
I know what's goin' on.

193
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:28,441
But you should at least
look him in the eye.

194
00:14:35,323 --> 00:14:37,701
[RUDEUS] What are you
making that face for?

195
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,207
Heh, what face?
This is how I look.

196
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:49,421
[RUDEUS] No. I've seen that
expression somewhere before.

197
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:51,548
But when?

198
00:14:51,631 --> 00:14:54,884
Oh, the mirror.

199
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:57,137
Right after I stopped going out.

200
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,391
[GAME CHARACTERS grunting]

201
00:15:01,474 --> 00:15:05,854
[FRIEND 17A] Aw man!
You're as amazing as ever!

202
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:07,689
I guess I shouldn't
be surprised.

203
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:12,318
You basically get to spend
all day practicing. [sighs]

204
00:15:12,402 --> 00:15:16,197
Must be nice, though!
Wish I could skip school.

205
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:20,243
But my dad's such a hard-ass,
he'd never let me do it.

206
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:23,288
At least not without
an excuse like yours.

207
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:24,581
Y'know?

208
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,043
[RUDEUS]
Cut the crap!

209
00:15:28,126 --> 00:15:29,377
[FRIEND 17A]
What'd I say?

210
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,546
Do you think it's fun
for me to live like this?

211
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:35,842
[FRIEND 17A] Whoa, chill out!
I was just joking around, man.

212
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:37,010
Yeah, right.

213
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:41,056
Do you have any idea
what they did to me?

214
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:44,768
[RUDEUS] At the time,
I thought, "How dare you?

215
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:48,855
Look how depressed I am!
Can't you see I'm in pain?

216
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:52,275
How can you be so upbeat?
So insensitive?"

217
00:15:54,277 --> 00:15:57,697
[RUDEUS] Except,
once I finally calmed down,

218
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:00,325
I realized I'd overreacted.

219
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:04,120
He'd been trying to
cheer me up, in his own way.

220
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:08,541
I decided to apologize
the next time he dropped by.

221
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,961
Only, he never came over again.

222
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:16,257
[RUDEUS] And I didn't
reach out to him, either.

223
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:18,927
I let my pride hold me back.

224
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:23,515
[RUDEUS]
But. Paul came back.

225
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:26,559
He went out of his way
to see me again.

226
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:31,940
Hey, Father? I have an idea.

227
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:33,108
[PAUL]
What?

228
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:34,734
It may be a challenge.

229
00:16:34,818 --> 00:16:37,320
But I think we should
try to act like grown-ups.

230
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:39,447
I don't see what
you're getting at.

231
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,617
[RUDEUS] I'm pretty sure
he's 30 this year.

232
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,453
Still younger than
I was when I died.

233
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,790
And yet, I never took
this kind of initiative.

234
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:50,875
I just focused
on blaming others.

235
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,671
Compared to me,
Paul's doing great.

236
00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:57,298
[RUDEUS] Let's pretend
yesterday never happened.

237
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:59,592
We didn't meet,
we didn't have a fight.

238
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:01,052
Instead, we're seeing
each other again

239
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:04,139
for the first time,
right now, in this moment.

240
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:06,266
We can start completely over.

241
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,184
I... What are you talking about?

242
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:11,021
[RUDEUS] But I refuse to
make the same mistakes again.

243
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:14,107
Don't overthink it!
Just come over here!

244
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,151
[PAUL]
Uh, 'kay.

245
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:18,695
[RUDEUS] Now, spread
your arms out. Go on!

246
00:17:18,778 --> 00:17:20,488
Sure. Like this?

247
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,449
[RUDEUS]
Mmm. Actually, would you mind

248
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:24,117
kneeling down for me, please?

249
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,619
Uh, 'kay, uh, how's that?

250
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,048
[RUDEUS]
Father! I missed you so much!

251
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,385
Ru... Rudy.

252
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:44,596
[RUDEUS]
Come on.

253
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:47,307
You've been reunited
with your long-lost son.

254
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,100
Anything you wanna say?

255
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:57,233
[PAUL]
I missed you, too.

256
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:04,115
[PAUL]
I missed you. I missed you.

257
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,410
Rudy!

258
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:14,042
[PAUL] I looked.
I couldn't find anyone.

259
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:18,254
And I... I thought
you might be dead.

260
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:24,177
I... I started picturing you,
and when I saw you...

261
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:31,101
[PAUL]
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Rudy!

262
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:36,022
[PAUL cries]

263
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:38,024
Oh, Father.

264
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,696
[RUDEUS] I'm sorry, too.
For everything.

265
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,369
[RUDEUS] And so, for the
first time in five years,

266
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:51,788
I was reunited with my father.

267
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,339
[RUDEUS] So, did you guys
ever have another?

268
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:04,009
[PAUL]
Nah, but not for lack of trying.

269
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:06,386
Dunno why,
we got you in one shot.

270
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:09,055
Well, I guess if you got a kid
this perfect every time,

271
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:10,640
the novelty might
eventually wear off.

272
00:19:10,724 --> 00:19:12,851
[PAUL]
Ohh, you're shameless.

273
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:18,023
[BOTH laugh]

274
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:22,444
Oh hey, I'm glad you
guys are back-- Eris!

275
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:24,612
Where did that giant
bruise come from?

276
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,532
[RUIJERD]
I had some trouble stopping her.

277
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,658
[RUDEUS]
Oh.

278
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:30,785
What are you doing with him?

279
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,495
[PAUL]
Uh...

280
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:34,164
Well, we kinda made up.

281
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:36,374
[ERIS gasps]
How dare you?

282
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,792
He doesn't deserve
your forgiveness

283
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,711
after how he treated you!

284
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:41,921
Eris, I understand
where you're coming from,

285
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:43,965
but it's just...

286
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,091
Just what?

287
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:48,178
Look, everybody makes
mistakes, okay?

288
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:51,014
It's a part of
being human, you know?

289
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:53,433
[PAUL] I am deeply
sorry for the trouble

290
00:19:53,516 --> 00:19:55,226
I caused the three of you.

291
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,603
It's fine.

292
00:19:56,686 --> 00:19:59,147
If you were able to make up,
that's all that matters.

293
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,482
Whatever!

294
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,362
[RUDEUS]
Healing.

295
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:11,368
[RUDEUS] Now. I know it's
sudden, but let's go ahead

296
00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:14,579
and call our second Millishion
strategy meeting to order.

297
00:20:14,662 --> 00:20:16,915
Didn't we have one
like two days ago?

298
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:18,708
[RUDEUS]
Well, our situation changed.

299
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:19,668
[ERIS]
Hm?

300
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:20,794
Thanks to my father,

301
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:22,837
we don't need to
stay here any longer.

302
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,631
He's given us plenty
of traveling money

303
00:20:24,714 --> 00:20:26,549
and a nice letter
of introduction.

304
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:29,928
Now getting to the Central
Continent will be a cinch.

305
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:31,596
H-However...

306
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:37,519
Eris. I hate to say it,

307
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:42,691
but it sounds like our homeland
doesn't really exist anymore.

308
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,112
[ERIS]
Oh.

309
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:50,323
And even worse,
among the missing

310
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:52,534
are Lords Phillip and Sauros.

311
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:55,495
[ERIS]
Okay.

312
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:58,998
And no one has seen or
heard from Ghislaine, either.

313
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:00,333
It's possible--

314
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:02,627
[ERIS]
Listen, Rudeus.

315
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:03,837
[gasps]

316
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:08,717
I was already prepared
for that much!

317
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:11,761
Were you really?

318
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,225
[RUDEUS] In that case,
I'd like to leave tomorrow.

319
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:19,394
Would that be okay with you two?

320
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:21,646
[ERIS]
Yep, no objections outta me.

321
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,064
[RUIJERD]
Are you sure?

322
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:26,901
Once we leave, you may never
see your father again.

323
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,945
True, but if we stay,

324
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:31,406
I may never see the rest of
our family again, either.

325
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:35,035
So I'd like to
make them my priority.

326
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:38,204
[RUIJERD]
I see. Makes sense.

327
00:21:47,547 --> 00:21:49,674
[RUDEUS]
All right! That's everything.

328
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:52,344
You three be careful
out there, okay?

329
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:56,556
Oh, Norn. Will you come out and
say goodbye to your big brother?

330
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:57,974
Don't wanna.

331
00:21:58,058 --> 00:21:59,225
[RUDEUS]
Norn.

332
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:01,394
I do look forward to
seeing you again!

333
00:22:01,478 --> 00:22:03,313
We can do that, right?

334
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:05,857
[NORN]
No!

335
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:17,660
You should always
cherish your siblings.

336
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,626
[RUDEUS]
Well. Guess we're off.

337
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:25,543
Take care, Father.

338
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:28,296
Yeah. You, too, kid.

339
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,230
[GEESE] Done sayin'
yer goodbyes to the boy?

340
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:49,067
Geese! I guess I
owe you one, don't I?

341
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,027
Yeh, but who's keeping score?

342
00:22:51,111 --> 00:22:54,656
Uh-- What's that?
Are you leaving, too?

343
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:56,366
[GEESE]
Yep. Sure am.

344
00:22:56,449 --> 00:22:59,285
I combed the Great Forest,
so Begaritt is up next.

345
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:01,287
No one's looked
there yet, right?

346
00:23:02,497 --> 00:23:04,874
Are you still? For me--?

347
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,836
[GEESE]
See ya!

348
00:23:16,302 --> 00:23:17,804
Right!

349
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:19,180
Listen up, ladies.

350
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,558
We have an immediate
change of plans.

351
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,686
Round everyone up for a meeting.

352
00:23:26,312 --> 00:23:28,273
[VIERRA, SHIERRA]
Yes, sir!
