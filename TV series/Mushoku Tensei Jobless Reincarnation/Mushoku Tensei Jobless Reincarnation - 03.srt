1
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:13,096
[RUDEUS] That little girl gave
me something truly priceless.

2
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,391
I can go out.
I'm done being a shut‐in.

3
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,770
[RUDEUS]
I won't let that go to waste.

4
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,526
[RUDEUS] This is the first day
of the rest of my life.

5
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,162
[RUDEUS]
Okay!

6
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,750
[PAUL]
Ohh...

7
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,961
Hey! Not while‐‐

8
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,588
[RUDEUS]
Mother! Father!

9
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,673
[PAUL clears throat]

10
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,841
May I go and play
outside for a while?

11
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,761
[PAUL] Outside? Well, sure.
Of course you can.

12
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,430
Oh, darling! Rudy is
going out on his own!

13
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,724
And I used to
worry he was sickly.

14
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,060
But time really does fly, huh?

15
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,436
Indeed.

16
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,231
Did you think something
was wrong with me?

17
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:05,899
You never cried about anything.

18
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,234
[RUDEUS]
That bothered you?

19
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:10,195
But I've grown up to be
so strong and charming!

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,323
Yeah, and it's
always been the ways

21
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,617
you don't act like a kid
that worry me the most.

22
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:16,827
[RUDEUS]
Am I not turning out to be

23
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,912
the firstborn son you wanted?

24
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,456
I mean, I'm not complaining.

25
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,416
[RUDEUS]
Then what?

26
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,334
I'm only trying to become
a more worthy heir

27
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,795
to the Greyrat legacy.

28
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,172
Ha! Well, if that's what
you want, then get out there

29
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,258
and bring home
a girlfriend or two.

30
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,218
I understand. I won't rest

31
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,554
until I find a woman who's
a match for dear Mother.

32
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,430
Aww!

33
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:41,435
Ha! Oh, and don't forget
to be kind, son.

34
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,020
A man should never
use his strength

35
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,396
to push people around.

36
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,315
Yeah, I know
that much, at least!

37
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,566
And if you've
taught me anything,

38
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,277
a man should use his strength
to show off to girls.

39
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,280
Right. Uh! No, that's not right.

40
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,198
[laughs] I'm just kidding.

41
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,410
We should use it to protect
the weak, shouldn't we?

42
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,330
Well. Yeah. You got
it that time.

43
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,916
Okay then, I'm off!

44
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,085
Be careful, sweetie!

45
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,881
He's such a wonderful boy.

46
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,800
I only hope I'm a good
enough father to him.

47
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,945
Good morning!

48
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,823
Hey, how's it going?

49
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,644
[RUDEUS] Look at this.
I'm out on my own!

50
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,479
I may not get to thank Roxy,

51
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,315
but I'll always
treasure her holy relic.

52
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,574
[SOMAL]
We don't want your kind here!

53
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,908
[CHILD 03A]
Go back to the Demon Continent!

54
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,869
[CHILD 03B]
And stay there!

55
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,455
[SOMAL]
Yeah! Get lost, demon!

56
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,498
[CHILD 03B]
Take this!

57
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,042
[RUDEUS]
Well, this feels familiar.

58
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,805
Knock it off!

59
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,599
[KIDS gasp]

60
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,433
What was that?

61
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,185
Ganging up to bully
a helpless kid?

62
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,936
Guys like you are the worst!

63
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,271
[CHILD 03B]
We're over here, idiot!

64
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,482
[CHILD 03A] You're the
knight's kid. Butt out!

65
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:37,611
[RUDEUS chuckles] Give it
your best shot, I'm not scared!

66
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,489
Where'd he get that water from?

67
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,115
[RUDEUS chuckles]

68
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,871
This is lame. Let's go.

69
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,377
Are you okay?

70
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:57,798
Wow.

71
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,051
[RUDEUS]
Holy crap. This kid's a looker.

72
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,763
He's gonna be a total chick
magnet here in a few years.

73
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,016
[SYLPH]
Uh. Yeah. I'm all right.

74
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,060
Hey, lean forward
for just a second.

75
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,937
Uh. 'Kay.

76
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,065
[RUDEUS] He's pretty cooperative
when he's not being screamed at.

77
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,276
Calling it now, he's gonna
be a dude magnet, too.

78
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,194
[gasps]

79
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,696
[RUDEUS]
Hey! Close your eyes.

80
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,659
You'll have to wash
your clothes at home.

81
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,786
There. All done.

82
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,788
[SYLPH]
Th‐Thank you.

83
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,541
[ROXY] They're fairly
easy to recognize:

84
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,418
they all have emerald green hair
and red gems in their foreheads.

85
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,879
So don't you dare go
anywhere near them.

86
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,469
[RUDEUS] His forehead
is smooth and white.

87
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:49,015
Okay, safe. He's not one of
those dangerous Superds.

88
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,309
But, those ears.

89
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,563
[RUDEUS] You know,
kids like that won't stop

90
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,648
unless you learn to fight back.

91
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,316
Are... Are you sure
the way I look

92
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,068
doesn't scare you or anything?

93
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,195
No way, my master was Migurdian.

94
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,656
Are you a demon, too?

95
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,743
I'm not sure.
My dad says that I'm not.

96
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,956
[RUDEUS] He doesn't know?
At his age? That's odd.

97
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:16,042
Mom's human. My dad's half elf.

98
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,796
[RUDEUS] Nice, I knew it!
Of course this world has elves!

99
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:24,676
But my hair color isn't the same
as either of my parents.

100
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,304
[cries]

101
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,807
Huh? Wait, please
don't cry! There, there.

102
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,603
[RUDEUS] Sounds like his home
life is a little complicated.

103
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,605
But no one should
get pelted with mud

104
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,607
just for their hair color.

105
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,569
[RUDEUS] Just thinking
about it pisses me off.

106
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,616
[SYLPH]
Um. Why did you help me?

107
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,992
[RUDEUS]
My father always told me that

108
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,161
I should be an ally to the weak.

109
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,039
[SYLPH] But the other kids
might not like you now.

110
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,583
I'd rather play with you
than a bunch of bullies.

111
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,417
Huh?

112
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,920
We are friends now, aren't we?

113
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,004
[gasps]

114
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,632
[RUDEUS] Unless you're too busy
with chores or something?

115
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,841
[SYLPH]
Mm‐mm!

116
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,259
[RUDEUS chuckles]

117
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,761
[RUDEUS]
This guy.

118
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:11,264
A little more confidence and
the girls will be all over him.

119
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,559
A few might even come
my way if we stick together.

120
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,979
You know, I never
introduced myself!

121
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,649
My name is Rudeus. And you?

122
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,027
It's Sylph.

123
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,032
[RUDEUS]
Sylph? That's a cool name!

124
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,242
You're like a wind spirit!

125
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,079
Yeah.

126
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,961
[RUDEUS giggles]

127
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,924
[RUDEUS] Woohoo!
What do you want to play?

128
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,217
I don't know.

129
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,178
I've never played
with a friend before.

130
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,056
[RUDEUS] Yeah, I guess he's
never really had one, huh?

131
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,016
I feel bad for him.

132
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,394
Though, I don't really
have friends, either.

133
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,188
That trick you
did before. Do it again.

134
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,022
Trick?

135
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,567
Like when you made warm water
go all sploosh from your hands,

136
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,903
and then you made
that woosh of hot air.

137
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,947
Oh. Magic.

138
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,032
[SYLPH]
Can I do it, too?

139
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,703
[RUDEUS] Sure, if you learn
the right incantations. I think.

140
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,830
"Incantations"?

141
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,793
Do you want to?

142
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,169
Uh‐‐

143
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,969
Okay! Then we'll start
your training right away.

144
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,731
[RUDEUS]
I'm home, Father!

145
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,192
[RUDEUS]
Father?

146
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,737
[PAUL] Do you know why
I'm upset with you?

147
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:53,825
[RUDEUS] Nope. Is this about
Roxy's panti‐‐ holy relic?

148
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,243
Uh, no sir, I don't.

149
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,911
Interesting.

150
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,748
I hear you punched
Ms. Eto's boy Somal today.

151
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:04,210
[RUDEUS sighs]
My stash is safe. Wait, what?

152
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,628
Did you say today?

153
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,130
[PAUL]
I did.

154
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,424
[RUDEUS]
Aha. I gotcha.

155
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,468
Must be the brat
who was bullying Sylph.

156
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,053
I'm not sure what
you heard, Father,

157
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:13,928
but I promise you‐‐

158
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,722
Enough! When you do
something wrong,

159
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,557
you apologize first!

160
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,392
I was playing by myself
and I heard voices‐‐

161
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,728
[PAUL]
No excuses!

162
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,896
[RUDEUS]
His mind's made up,

163
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,315
and he has no intention
of hearing me out.

164
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,524
[PAUL]
What's that look for?

165
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,235
[RUDEUS] I could apologize
and get it over with,

166
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,988
but I don't think that
would be best for Paul.

167
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,616
Well then? Why won't
you say anything?

168
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,660
[RUDEUS] Because you'll just
yell at me to not make excuses.

169
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,661
What?

170
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,538
You want to shout
and make me apologize

171
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,332
before I can explain?

172
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,918
Must be nice to lord that
kind of power over a kid.

173
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,419
Rudy!

174
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,462
[slap]

175
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,220
[RUDEUS] Father. I have always
put in the utmost effort

176
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,014
to be a good son
to you and Mother.

177
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,141
Well, that's beside the point.

178
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,684
No, it isn't.

179
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,228
I've worked hard
to earn your trust,

180
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,313
and you took
someone else's word.

181
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,149
You yelled at me,
you raised your hand to me,

182
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,276
and still you refuse to listen.

183
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,570
And? You injured little Somal!

184
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,198
I won't apologize
even if that is my fault.

185
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,076
I'm proud of what I did today.

186
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,578
Wait, hang on.
Tell me what happened.

187
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,123
I thought you
told me "no excuses."

188
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,669
But please don't worry
about it, Father.

189
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,004
The next time I see three
kids ganging up on someone

190
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,590
who won't fight back,
I'll simply ignore it.

191
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,342
In fact, I'll even
jump in myself

192
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,052
and make it four against one.

193
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,554
I'll be sure to
let everyone know

194
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,848
that that's the
Greyrat family way.

195
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,266
But once I grow up
and leave home,

196
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,351
I'll never use
the Greyrat name again.

197
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,145
I'll be too ashamed
to belong to a family

198
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,523
that ignores violence
and accepts verbal abuse.

199
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,735
[RUDEUS]
You'd better take the L, Paul.

200
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,488
I know you can't tell,
but I spent two decades

201
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,950
weaseling my way out of
unwinnable arguments.

202
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,786
And this time,
I'm completely in the right.

203
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,955
You haven't got a chance.

204
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,791
[PAUL]
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

205
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,543
Tell me what happened.

206
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,337
[RUDEUS]
Hi, Mother!

207
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,257
[ZENITH] Welcome back, Rudy.
Did you have fun today?

208
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,176
[RUDEUS]
Yeah, I made a new friend.

209
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,344
[ZENITH]
You did? How wonderful!

210
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,680
[PAUL]
That could have gone better.

211
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:21,764
I expect you to
give that son...

212
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,475
[PAUL] Somal did have
one heck of a black eye.

213
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,727
Just look at what he did!

214
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,979
[PAUL]
Rudeus matured so quickly.

215
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:32,108
I was almost relieved to hear
he'd done something so childish.

216
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,070
Even so. He's already a
Saint‐Class water mage.

217
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,157
Of course he would have trouble
relating with the other kids.

218
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,868
I only meant to
scold him a little.

219
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,412
Where did I go wrong?

220
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,372
How stupid.

221
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,957
I want to show him
those with power

222
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,293
shouldn't resort
to violence, and yet...

223
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,921
What's the matter?
You look gloomy.

224
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:57,634
[PAUL] Mm. Ah. I had a little
fight with Rudy earlier.

225
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,677
That's not like you.

226
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,555
I was this close to
telling him to leave.

227
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,099
I bet he would have done it
without a second thought.

228
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,976
Just like that.

229
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,353
You mean like you did?

230
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,646
[PAUL chuckles]

231
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,859
[PAUL] I wonder if
this is how my dad felt.

232
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,862
I wish I'd gotten to apologize.

233
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,036
[RUDEUS]
And it's summer again.

234
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,162
Those bratty kids kept

235
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,081
coming after me and
Sylph for a while,

236
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,625
but they're pretty
easy to take care of.

237
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,294
That one mom keeps
showing up to complain.

238
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,046
But, if we're being
honest, I think she's

239
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,007
more interested in Paul
than her kid's wellbeing.

240
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,594
She just wants an excuse
to come see him. Stupid.

241
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:47,183
[sighs] Why is it so hot?
It sucks out here.

242
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,604
I'm sorry. Am I late?

243
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,648
Nope! I just got here.

244
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,400
[RUDEUS]
I didn't.

245
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,944
I did it!

246
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,487
[RUDEUS]
Sylph's mana has grown a lot

247
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,072
in the past six months.

248
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,825
He can train for hours
at a time now.

249
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,743
So I guess the idea
that there are limits

250
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,789
on a person's magical
reserves is total bunk.

251
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,791
Hey! I wanna learn
that one you did

252
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,293
where you made a warm breeze!

253
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,460
Oh, that?

254
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:18,339
For that one, you conjure water,
and then apply fire to it.

255
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,512
You didn't even have to
say anything out loud.

256
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,806
[RUDEUS]
Hm? Silent spellcasting.

257
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,517
I think it might be kind of
hard for a beginner.

258
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,811
So? Show me how.

259
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,987
[RUDEUS]
Let me think.

260
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,283
[RUDEUS sighs]
Okay.

261
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,243
You know how when you
say an incantation,

262
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,786
you feel all your
mana rush through

263
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,455
your body into your fingertips?

264
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,748
[SYLPH]
Mm.

265
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,667
[RUDEUS] You gotta focus on that
feeling for a specific spell,

266
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,086
but then recreate it
without saying the words.

267
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,212
Does that make sense?

268
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,006
Try it with an easy one.

269
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,257
[SYLPH]
'Kay!

270
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:07,513
[SYLPH grunting]

271
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,098
[RUDEUS] It's hard to
teach something you do

272
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,935
by feeling alone.
Even Roxy couldn't do it.

273
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,481
Maybe wordless casting
really is special.

274
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,733
Actually, I kinda hope it is.

275
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,818
I had nothing going
for me in my old life.

276
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,155
Would a convenient skill or two
be too much to ask for?

277
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,908
[SYLPH] I did it!
Rudy, did you see that?

278
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,161
[SYLPH giggles]
I did it! I did it!

279
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,746
Way to go!

280
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:43,216
[SYLPH giggles]
I did it! I figured it out!

281
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,718
Hey, Sylph! Wait up!

282
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,097
Sylph, come on!

283
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,310
[sighs]

284
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,020
[RUDEUS sighs]

285
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,775
[RUDEUS]
He really is a looker.

286
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,361
Even a dude like me can see it.

287
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,446
Dammit. I'm jealous.

288
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,407
The old me had a friend
like this in junior high,

289
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,200
but "she" was a "girl."

290
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,703
She wasn't into me, but I
thought about her all the time.

291
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,455
Even after I found out
she'd got married,

292
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,125
I could still punch my clown
about three times a day

293
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,002
to the ol'
"childhood friend" trope.

294
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,010
[RUDEUS]
Hurry up, Sylph!

295
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,389
Hey, I'm back.

296
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,724
There you are. Welcome home.

297
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,102
Young Master and... friend?

298
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,062
Nice to meet you.

299
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,565
I've drawn a bath for you.

300
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,400
Great. Thank you.

301
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,860
Follow me, Sylph!

302
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,736
[SYLPH]
O‐Okay.

303
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:53,536
Perfect. What's the matter?

304
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,706
[RUDEUS] You'll get cold
standing around like that.

305
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,708
Uh, yeah.

306
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,751
Then get undressed and hop in.

307
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,254
Uh, 'kay.

308
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,338
[RUDEUS]
Come on, now.

309
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,173
[SYLPH gasps]

310
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,216
You're old enough
to do this yourself.

311
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,595
[SYLPH gasping]

312
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,144
I don't know what you're
so embarrassed for.

313
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,562
But these gotta come off, too.

00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,231
[SYLPH gasps]
No. Please don't.

315
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,108
I'm serious,
you're gonna get sick.

316
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,068
Just do it.

317
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,361
Cut it out!

00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,822
[RUDEUS] Trust me, bud,
I know exactly how you feel.

319
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,742
The old me wouldn't wanna bathe
with other dudes, either.

320
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,244
Welcome to the weird
dick club, champ.

321
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,580
I promise I won't laugh at you.

That's not what I... Rudy, no!

323
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,793
[RUDEUS] What the hell's this
kid got going on down there?

324
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,880
[RUDEUS]
You kidding me with this?

325
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,924
Don't make me get naked alone.

326
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,176
[RUDEUS] All right, fine.
Bathe like that.

327
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,970
But you're gonna have to
change at some point.

328

[SYLPH screams]

331
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,611
[RUDEUS] What flashed before
my eyes in that moment

332
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:12,323
was not the pure short sword
I've grown accustomed to.

333
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,658
Now, it wasn't some dark blade

334
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,118
covered in sinister
designs, either.

335
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,538
What should have
been there, simply wasn't.

336
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,041
And what was there
stunned me to my core.

337
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,377
In my old life, I'd only
ever seen one on my monitor

338
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,421
while I was "taming
the beast," so to speak.

339
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:31,676
And then I realized what I'd
just done was not okay at all.

340
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,679
He was a she.

341
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,229
I think we should talk about
what just happened.

342
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,147
I'm sorry.

343
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,358
[PAUL] I won't fly off
the handle this time.

344
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,361
I refuse to make
that mistake twice.

345
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,489
Just tell me why
you did it, kid.

346
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,157
We were wet from the rain.

347
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,451
I thought she was
gonna catch a cold.

348
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,870
[PAUL]
But, she said "no," didn't she?

349
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,373
Yes. I'm sorry.

350
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,750
This is only going to get
more important as you grow up,

351
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,044
so I need you to
pay close attention.

352
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,005
You have to be respectful.

353
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,132
Okay. I'm sorry.

354
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,592
I won't do it again.

355
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,010
Don't say that to me.

356
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,929
Go apologize
to Sylphiette. Okay?

357
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,682
Sylphiette? Of course.

358
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,144
Is she ever gonna forgive me?

359
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,522
[PAUL chuckles]
Ah, don't you worry.

360
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:30,359
As long as you apologize
sincerely, I'm sure she will.

361
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:37,366
[PAUL] I know how it feels when
the girl you like rejects you.

362
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:41,245
It seems my particular fondness
for women runs in the family.

363
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,915
But you're such
a smart boy, my son.

364
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,501
I know you'll learn a lot
from this failure.

365
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,883
[PAUL] I still worry about you,
but I'm so hopeful.

366
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,218
I'm sorry, Sylphiette!

367
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,386
Your hair is really short,

368
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,972
so I actually thought you were
a boy this whole time!

[laughs] Not your
best effort, kid!

Are you still having trouble
making up with Sylphiette,

378
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,799
or is it somethin' else?

379
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,634
Yeah. She's still upset

380
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,136
and my swordsmanship
hasn't improved, either.

381
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,722
You want some friendly
advice from your old man?

382
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:42,973
Absolutely.

383
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,685
Uhh, I don't know.

384
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,436
Shall I lick your boots?

385
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,855
Eager, are we?

386
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,983
Listen, Rudy.
Women like our strength,

387
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,694
but sometimes it's
important to show them

388
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,404
our softer aspects as well.

389
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,279
Ohh.

390
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,116
Think for a second: If someone
clearly stronger than you

391
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,326
were to chase after
you with naked lust,

392
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,412
how would that
make you feel, son?

393
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,247
I guess I'd be scared?

394
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,667
Of course. So show her
your vulnerable side instead.

395
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,794
I get it! But where do I start?

396
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,254
Next time you see Sylphiette,

397
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,549
be honest with her about all
the feelings you've bottled up.

398
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,050
Let her know how much
you miss her

399
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,386
or that you're worried
she's been avoiding you.

400
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,139
After that, it's all up to her.

401
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,395
But if it goes well,
she might even console you.

402
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,815
[RUDEUS gasps] So what do I do
if it doesn't go well?

403
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,150
You come right back to me

404
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,818
and I'll tell you
what the next move is.

405
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,319
Whoa. That's so cool!

You've got backup plans
and everything!

Are you okay? Rudy?

00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,428
I... I was just thinking
that I haven't seen

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,305
your c‐cute face
around here lately,

415
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,474
and that's a real
shame, you know?

416
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,476
Yeah! 'Cause you're,
like, really cute,

00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,602
and your hair is pretty,

00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,771
so have you thought
about growing it out?

00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,773
Huh? Not really.

I promise I don't hate you
or anything, Rudy.

425
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,048
Are you sure?

426
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,760
Can we just go back to normal?

427
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,971
[RUDEUS]
A cute, kind girl my own age.

428
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,433
I have no idea how to be friends
with someone like her.

429
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,644
And now that I know
she's a girl,

430
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,522
it's hard not to
think about the future.

431
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:58,108
But she wants our relationship
to stay exactly the same.

432
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,320
[RUDEUS] So, I won't
think too hard about it.

433
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:03,155
And to the best of my ability,

434
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:07,493
I'm going to cherish my first
real friend in this new world.

teach my six‐year‐old son?
