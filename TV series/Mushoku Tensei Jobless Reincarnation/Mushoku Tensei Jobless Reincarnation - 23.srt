I'd say it's high time

And since you don't appear
to be otherwise occupied,

00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:24,856
I'd like to enlist your
help in a few matters.

46
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,528
Namely, improving
our infrastructure.

47
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,364
Our agricultural
efforts have suffered

48
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:34,324
due to our distance
from the river.

49
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:36,076
But I imagine using
earth magic to dig

50
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:38,870
a few wells should be
no trouble for you.

We'll also soon feel
a greater need

for proper housing,
rather than tents.

54
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:50,548
Unfortunately,
we lack the manpower.

55
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,258
Not to mention...

56
00:05:56,638 --> 00:05:59,349
With regard to dear Lady Eris.

00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:01,393
I intend to report
that she tragically

58
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:04,562
perished following the
teleportation incident.

59
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:12,070
[ALPHONSE]
Of course, revealing that now

60
00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:15,532
would likely hinder our
reconstruction efforts.

61
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:18,952
So the official announcement
won't be for some time yet.

I'm real sorry to hear she
ran out on you like that.

I intend to restore Fittoa
to its former glory,

with or without the young miss.

65
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:31,881
Then I suggest you leave
me alone and get to work.

66
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:36,636
Given what transpired
between you and Lady Eris,

67
00:06:36,678 --> 00:06:39,848
I thought allowing you to
rest idly would be a kindness.

00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:42,809
But as refugees continue
to pour in from Millishion,

we're running short
on both tents and food.

So that's it.
You're here to kick me out.

I'm here to remind you

that you aren't
the only one suffering.

done differently?

00:12:45,755 --> 00:12:47,132
[BOTH]
Hit me!

158
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:49,092
[TAVERN cheers]

159
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:51,886
Foolish mortals!
Victory is mine!

160
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:56,725
I did it! I did it!
I did it! [cackles]

161
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:58,977
I am unstoppable!

162
00:13:37,557 --> 00:13:38,767
[sighs]

163
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:48,026
That ought to settle your debt,
but now I'm broke.

164
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:49,194
That's just great.

165
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:52,197
Now, now, don't waste precious
time dwelling on details!

166
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:54,657
Let me instead commend you
for your selflessness!

167
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:56,659
I'll happily reward you
for your aid!

168
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:58,912
I kinda doubt that.

169
00:13:58,953 --> 00:14:02,040
We've already established that
you're completely penniless.

170
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:04,918
Though, I would like you
to pay me back somehow.

171
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,380
Well, as luck would have it.

172
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:11,007
You just happen
to be speaking with

173
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:15,720
the Great Emperor of
the Demon World...

174
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:19,474
Kishirika Kishirisu!

175
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:21,226
I may be short of coin,

176
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:24,187
but I can bestow
a demon eye upon you!

177
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:27,607
[sighs] I remember now.
In that case,

178
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,192
I would prefer that
you use your eyes

179
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:31,653
to find someone for me,
Your Majesty.

180
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:34,739
What? You would use your one
wish for the sake of another?

181
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:36,783
Bravo, how admirable!

182
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:38,159
Who is it you seek?

183
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:40,161
Your long-lost lover
or something?

184
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:41,454
That's not it.

185
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:42,831
I'm looking for
the missing family

186
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:45,291
of somebody named
Rudeus Greyrat.

187
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,419
Just leave it to me, then!

188
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,840
What was that
name again? Greyrat?

189
00:14:51,881 --> 00:14:55,176
Oh! Ding, ding, ding, got 'em!

190
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:56,177
[ROXY]
Huh?

191
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,060
It's Daddy!

192
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:12,652
[PAUL]
Aisha.

193
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:18,366
It's been a long time.
I've missed you, my lord.

194
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:19,743
[PAUL]
Lilia.

195
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:35,800
[PAUL]
It's all right. I'm here now.

196
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,222
What about Mommy?
I don't see her.

197
00:15:41,264 --> 00:15:44,225
Master Rudeus did say
that she was still missing,

198
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:45,769
but I'd hoped...

199
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,610
[PAUL]
Norn, your mom is waiting for

200
00:15:53,651 --> 00:15:56,112
your big brother
to come get her.

201
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:57,655
So just you wait.

202
00:15:57,697 --> 00:16:00,075
We'll be together
before too long, 'kay?

203
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:07,624
[KISHIRIKA]
Ah-ha! The father, the maid,

204
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:08,667
and the two little girls

205
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,586
have been happily
reunited in Millishion!

206
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:13,546
That's amazing!

207
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:20,553
[KISHIRIKA]
Now, the mother is, uh...

208
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:26,309
[KISHIRIKA]
Uh...

209
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:36,820
[KISHIRIKA]
Nope. Can't get a good look.

210
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,321
So, you can't see her?

211
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:40,699
But I thought you could
find anyone, Your Greatness!

212
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,326
[KISHIRIKA] Sorry. But I do know
her approximate location!

213
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:44,452
Then where is she?

214
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:45,745
[KISHIRIKA]
I believe

215
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:48,581
she's on the Begaritt Continent,
in the Labyrinth City of Rapan!

216
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:51,084
At any rate,
she is alive, isn't she?

217
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:52,377
[KISHIRIKA]
Mm-hm!

218
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:56,381
And what about Rudy?

219
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:59,551
[KISHIRIKA]
Hm? Right, hang on a sec.

220
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:03,388
Ah! Rudeus is back on
the Central Continent!

221
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,809
And boy oh boy, he's looking
depressed! [cackles]

222
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:10,145
Perhaps some food he scavenged
disagreed with him!

223
00:17:10,186 --> 00:17:12,397
Oh, is that so?

224
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:14,983
Pardon my earlier
impertinence, Your Majesty.

225
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:16,443
I appreciate your help.

226
00:17:16,484 --> 00:17:17,777
[KISHIRIKA]
Think nothing of it!

227
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,738
Consider us even!

228
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:23,533
Now, fare thee well! [cackles]

229
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:33,460
[ELINALISE]
The Begaritt Continent, hmm?

230
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:34,669
But if Zenith really is alive,

231
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:38,089
you have to wonder why
she hasn't contacted anyone.

232
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:40,091
[ROXY]
Hard to say.

233
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,886
But she could be
in some kind of trouble.

234
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:46,639
[ELINALISE] What should we do
about her son, then?

235
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:48,350
I'm not sure.

236
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:52,187
It does worry me a little to
hear he's been depressed, but...

237
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,149
[ROXY] If I know Rudy,
he'll get back up

238
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:58,360
on his own before too long.

239
00:18:02,322 --> 00:18:04,991
[RUDEUS] People don't
bounce back that easily,

240
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:08,370
no matter how many
chances they get to do it.

241
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:12,749
It's easier to fall into a hole
than it is to climb out of one.

242
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,877
I was surrounded by
people who loved me.

243
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,046
Who reached out to me.

244
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:19,881
And I rejected them.

245
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:22,801
I was trapped
by my own paranoia.

246
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:24,844
Convinced that, regardless
of what they told me,

247
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:27,806
they were all laughing
at me behind my back.

248
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:31,267
I used to dream,
if I had just one more chance,

249
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:34,062
I could get back to normal.
Do things right.

250
00:18:34,104 --> 00:18:37,190
But, too little, too late.

251
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:39,901
No one reaches out anymore.

252
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:44,447
And why would they?
I won't actually change.

253
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:48,034
And no one would
notice if I tried.

254
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:51,955
So, might as well
keep dreaming. Right?

255
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:57,711
[RUDEUS]
Keep dreaming.

256
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,408
[RUDEUS]
Gotcha!

257
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,492
[PAUL]
Hey, Rudy!

258
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:30,618
[ZENITH]
Oh, no.

259
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,120
[RUDEUS]
That was too easy, Father!

260
00:19:32,162 --> 00:19:33,663
I get the biggest
dinner plate tonight!

261
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,541
[PAUL] I beg to differ!
That was only if you won!

262
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,544
[RUDEUS] I landed a hit,
so I win by decision!

263
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:41,629
[PAUL]
Ah! Not so fast!

264
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:45,633
[PAUL]
All right, listen up!

265
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:47,427
Throwing mud in
my eyes is cheating!

266
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:48,970
Yeah, but you were
the one who taught me

267
00:19:49,012 --> 00:19:51,681
to pursue victory by
"any means necessary"!

268
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:52,682
[PAUL]
Ha!

269
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,394
Master Rudeus.

270
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:58,772
[RUDEUS]
Oh, yay! Thank you, Lilia.

271
00:19:58,813 --> 00:19:59,773
My lord.

272
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:01,024
[PAUL]
Yes, thank you.

273
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,443
My goodness,
you got so dirty out there!

274
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:06,780
[RUDEUS chuckles]
Yeah, sorry.

275
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:09,199
[yawns]

276
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,868
Ah. Guess I'm
a little bit sleepy.

277
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,496
You're not getting sick,
are you, Mother?

278
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:15,997
Why don't you go to bed early?

279
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:18,083
I'll clean up in here!

280
00:20:18,124 --> 00:20:22,045
Will you, now? Well, okay!

281
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,339
I might just
take you up on that.

282
00:20:24,381 --> 00:20:25,674
Please do!

283
00:20:27,884 --> 00:20:29,761
[ZENITH] But promise
you'll come wake me up

284
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:31,513
when you're done here, okay?

285
00:20:31,554 --> 00:20:33,056
Yeah, I can do that!

286
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,393
I would be happy to take
responsibility for waking you!

287
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,770
[RUDEUS]
Father!

288
00:20:41,147 --> 00:20:42,857
[RUDEUS] I need you
to take responsibility

289
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:43,900
for cleaning the floors!

290
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:47,278
Huh? Yeah, sure. In a sec.

291
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,239
Hey, sleepy girl.

292
00:20:51,574 --> 00:20:53,993
[RUDEUS] Father,
you should know this by now!

293
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:55,995
We need to be as efficient
when it comes to cleaning

294
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:57,664
as we are with training,
so I'm gonna need you to...

295
00:20:57,706 --> 00:20:59,791
[ZENITH]
Thank you so much, Rudy.

296
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,085
Yeah, it's the least
I can do for you!

297
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,795
You're my mom!

298
00:21:05,547 --> 00:21:06,840
[ZENITH]
Rudy?

299
00:21:08,174 --> 00:21:09,426
Yeah?

300
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:13,722
[ZENITH]
I love you.

301
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:23,815
[RUDEUS]
That's right.

302
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:30,071
[RUDEUS]
I have to go. I...

303
00:21:30,113 --> 00:21:32,157
I have to find Zenith.

304
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,796
[ELLEMOI]
Rudeus Greyrat, you say?

305
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:11,715
[CLEANE] How does one
become a Saint-class

306
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:13,717
water mage at age five?

307
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:16,052
And without incantations,
no less?

308
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,679
Provided that's all true,

309
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:19,889
I would love to
recruit him, but...

310
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,808
[LUKE]
It does sound so exaggerated

311
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,935
it's almost laughable.

312
00:23:25,228 --> 00:23:28,106
But you would like us to believe
this is not hyperbole,

313
00:23:28,148 --> 00:23:29,983
based on personal experience?

314
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:31,192
[FITZ]
I would. Yes.

315
00:23:31,234 --> 00:23:35,155
Then tell me, what exactly is
your relationship to this man?

316
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:38,408
[FITZ]
He is my savior, my mentor,

317
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,493
and my first friend.

318
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:42,746
And, truth be told...

319
00:23:45,373 --> 00:23:47,667
[FITZ]
If I had to pick one thing,

320
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:50,378
he's the person I respect most.
