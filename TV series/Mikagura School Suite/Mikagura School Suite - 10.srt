[ERUNA]
Hey, Seisa!

2
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,708
Guess what, girl!

3
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,458
Took long enough, but the
school has finally recognized

4
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:45,916
my legendary new club!

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,083
They even gave us a sweet
room to use and everything!

6
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:51,500
And that's why Eruna Ichinomiya
will vacate your mansion!

7
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,416
Here, take my sleeping bag!

8
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,041
She's been soaked
with a ton of memories,

9
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,458
so please take care of her.

10
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,791
I'll come back and visit
you soon, sleeping bag.

11
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,166
I swear it.
Remember me with her!

12
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,833
Gross.

13
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,500
The only thing that bag's
been "soaked" with

14
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,708
is your sweat and stench,
so why don't you go ahead

15
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,791
and take it with you
on your way out.

Oh, just you wait, Seisa,
my club is gonna be super fun!

19
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,916
Thank you for everything!

Ugh...

[BIMII sighs]

26
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,875
I hate this, ryui.

27
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,041
I bet.

28
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,583
I mean, the human thing
was weird enough,

29
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,666
but that was way more intense
than I thought it would be.

30
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,666
Maybe it's just Fuji,
but she has a feeling

31
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,708
we're getting a peek into
something creepy here,

32
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,125
like Mikagura has a
secret côté obscur.

33
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,583
If this wasn't real life,

34
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,500
I'd be afraid they wouldn't
let us return home alive.

35
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,750
Everything hurts.

36
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,416
Why do I always
forget how hard it is

37
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,666
to go back to this form, ryui?

38
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,041
Go back?

39
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,583
What? Bimii, are you telling
us you used to be human?

40
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,125
[BIMII sighs]
Yes, ryui.

41
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,458
It's a long, fascinating story.

42
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,083
To start with, what you just saw

43
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,875
isn't the way I'm
supposed to transform.

44
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,041
In fact...

45
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,083
[BIMII]
Hey! Where are you going?

46
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,416
Don't you want to listen
to my origin story?

47
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:34,583
[BIMII screams]

48
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,041
[BIMII]
Right behind you, ryui.

49
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,375
Yay!

50
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,208
Our room's starting to
look officially official!

51
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,666
About time.

52
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,541
But... I dunno... It just...

53
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:57,875
Does it look a little, um,
well, a lot dreary to you?

54
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,208
Well, obviously.

55
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,875
Don't worry, though.
We've got help!

56
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,125
Speak of the cute devils!

57
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,125
[KATAI sighs]

58
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,708
Congratulations
on your new club!

59
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,208
I bet you're both excited!

60
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,541
You said you were
looking for something

61
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,208
to decorate your new
room with, right?

62
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,875
Here, a hanging scroll
from the calligraphy club.

63
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:14,750
Our gift!

64
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,791
Cool! We got a scroll thingie!

65
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,333
[HIMI] Like a newborn butterfly
that is still a caterpillar,

66
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,875
your new club will shine
and fly out into a future

67
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,583
where no one touches its wings.

68
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,958
I wrote this scroll
in that spirit.

69
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:30,833
[ERUNA]
Perverted transformation?

70
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,000
[OTONE]
Metamorphose.

71
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,875
Ta-da! Do you love it?

72
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,666
Uh... Sure, why not?

73
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,708
My turn.

--How'd you do that?

He's a ninja!

76

Truth.

77
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,125
I brought you a
present from my club.

78
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,791
Nice!

79
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,125

on the pervert part!

Eruna, darling.

82
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,791
My present for you
is this double bed.

83
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,250
Naturally, we'll be
sleeping on it together!

84
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:01,375
[gasps] Eruna? Wh-What's wrong?!
Was it something I said?

85
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,625
Please don't...

86
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,916
Don't lock me away.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,291
It's so cold out
here in the hall.

88
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,708
[YUTO]
Well, look at you, Eruna!

89
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:09,708
Yeah, congrats!

90
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,541
I guess everyone
beat us here, huh?

91
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,875
Congratulations!

92
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,291
You should be proud of yourself!

93
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,333
Thanks a bunch. You're so sweet!

94
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,000
Is that to make the room yummy?

95
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,916
It is. I hope you enjoy it.

--[GROUP] Huh?
--Congrats to you, as well!

Wow! You have very good manners,

102
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,666
taking the time to greet
Fujishiro, as well.

103
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,250
At this point,
you seem promising,

104
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,791
so perhaps Fuji will be a little
convivial to you hereafter.

105
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,541
Eruna, you might wanna go ahead
and translate that for him.

Thank you! I'm so happy!

Please be friends
with me from now on!

Kiss and heart, XO forever!

Wrong!

Quit taking liberties
with what I said.

112
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,958
Fuji never mentioned XO.

113
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,666
Yeah, but kiss and
heart were there?

114

Well either way, I'd
like for us to be friends.

I didn't expect you to show.

119
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,750
Aren't you gonna go inside?

120

[KUZURYU]
Hmph.

Naw, you know I'm not
the best with crowds.

--[ERUNA] Uhh...

just leaving this creepy guy

126
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,458
at the door without taking
two seconds to come say hi?

127
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,416
Very much his style,
though, ryui.

It's weird that Seisa
hasn't swung by, yet, huh?

Now that you mention it,

130
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,041
I expected her to have made
an appearance by now, ryui.

You don't think she's
not happy for me, do you?

[TONKYUN]
Me too.

145

People have been telling stories
about a ghost for a while, now.

Correct, and all of us
at the newspaper club

are ready to take down
this so-called ghost.

Sounds cool.

So? What do you need from me?

you should do it now.

This is your only chance.

You know the identity
of this ghost.

after your previous lies?

you were making a fool
out of the newspaper club.

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,041
Thanks so much,

163
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,791
you really helped us get
that third member we needed.

164
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,833
[RUMINA] And where is this
so-called third member?

165
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:44,666
[ERUNA gasps]

166
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,333
Uh....

167
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,875
Just admit it.

168
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,625
You guys are the ones behind
this ghost nonsense, aren't you?

169
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:50,708
No, we're not!

170
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,375
For real! It's not
them, so back off.

171
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,375
Honestly, I don't know what this
ghost thing is about, either.

172
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,666
Fine.

173
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,125
Then, we've a mystery.

174
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,000
Who in the world could this
reported spirit really be?

175
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,166
[TONKYUN] Any chance it
could be, like, a real ghost?

176
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,875
What?! As in supernatural?

177
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:05,875
[BOTH yelp]

178
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,583
So? I'm not scared
at all, are you?

179
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,916
Not even a little!

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,375
--[bones rattling]
--Yeah. I'm not afraid either.

181
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,583
'Cause, otherwise, I'd be
all shaking like a leaf,

182
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,875
which I'm not. Nope.
I don't care at all.

183
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,041
Of course, that fake story
was an embarrassment,

184
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,458
but we can make
this an opportunity

185
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,916
to reclaim our good name.

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,250
So we're gonna find out
the truth no matter what.

187
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,375
I expect your club and friends
to help with the investigation.

188
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,333
You are going to help us with
this investigation, Eruna.

189
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,375
Yeah, duh, totally gonna help
you with all the ghost stuff.

190
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,500
Hey, Eruna?

191
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,916
Are you seriously gonna go
on a ghost hunt for Rumina?

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,083
Yeah! Know why?

193
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:44,208
'Cause ghosts are almost always
sad, needy, and beautiful girls!

194
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,791
[OTONE] I'm not sure if ours
is a beautiful girl or not,

195
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,125
but I guess it's true you don't
normally hear about ghosts

196
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,500
that are just like, overflowing
with joy and self-confidence.

197
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,833
[ERUNA]
See, that's what I'm saying.

198
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,125
So we have to find this
ghost lady and catch her.

199
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,166
Then, we can make her
take sexy pictures!

200
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,666
No way that won't
promote the club

201
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,583
and impress Seisa
at the same time!

202
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,375
Seisa Mikagura?

203
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,625
Why her?

204
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,333
Because she's the reason
Eruna created a new club

205
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,458
in the first place, ryui.

206
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,333
She wanted to prove
herself to Seisa.

207
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,458
[ERUNA]
Uh-huh!

208
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,625
Seisa...

209
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,958
My goal right now is
to make this a club

210
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,375
that will surprise her
with my coolness!

211
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,875
[BIMII] Eruna's what you could
call over-dedicated to this.

212
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,750
Hey! It's not just me, Bimii!

213
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,000
Come on, you transformed and

214
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,416
--turned into a student!
--Everything Eruna does

215
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,833
--A super hot student!
--is all for that Seisa girl.

216
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,000
--What was that
--I wonder...

217
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,416
--all about, huh?
--Does Seisa even know?

218
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
[ERUNA] I'm guessing it
wasn't for the yaoi fan girls!

219
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,666
[footsteps]

220
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,083
Here I am!

221
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,416
No way...

222
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,666
Aww, you drama club
nerds are the best!

223
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,458
We're going to help you
find that ghost, Eruna!

224
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,916
Figured it sounded
like fun, so why not?

225
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,083
[TONKYUN]
Unfortunately,

226
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,750
Kumano had something
come up last minute,

227
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,291
so she won't be able to join us.

228
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,000
I wish I had thought of that.

229
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,541
Himi sends her love.

230
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,916
She said she had a stomachache
and wasn't going to make it.

231
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,416
That's a bummer.

232
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,833
But major kudos to you for
deciding to come without her!

233
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,375
--Here you go!
--Huh?

234
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,041
Did you bring that because we're
supposed to "catch" a ghost?

235
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,500
[TONKYUN] Eruna, we're talking
about a supernatural being,

236
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,875
not a butterfly.

237
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,583
Huh? I thought Otone
would be here by now.

238
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,458
She's not?

239
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,958
Expected her to be first.

240
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,000
Strange that she would
be later than me.

241
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,291
Especially since she left
before we did, ryui.

242

[ring]

243
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,833
[ERUNA]
Uh. It's from Otone!

244
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,625
[BIMII]
What's wrong, ryui?

245
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,625
Otone said there was something
else that she had to do.

246
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,416
[nervous laugh] I had a feeling
that girl was more afraid of

247
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,416
this ghost hunting adventure
than she let on.

248
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,583
Heh.

249
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,666
That sounds pretty
funny coming from a guy

250
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,041
whose whole body is shaking.

251
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,458
[USAMARU]
What?!

252
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,875
No, I'm not shaking with fear;
I'm shaking with rage!

253
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,750
I'm about to kill
this ghost, man!

254

[YUTO]
All right!

freak show on the road?

Yeah!

You're the rookie battle winner.

I'm Otone Fujishiro.

I apologize for
calling so late, ma'am.

I was hoping to speak with
Seisa Mikagura if possible.

264
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:05,166
Unfortunately, my lady has gone
to bed and is not available.

It's okay.

[NYAMIRIN]
Yes, hush it.

276
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,583
You're going to scare
the ghost away!

277
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,500
But I saw things!
Horrible things!

[USAMARU]
Where'd it go?

[TONKYUN]
What are we looking at?

280
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,333
No way! Did you find the ghost?

281
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,125
[ERUNA]
Usamaru! There's nothing there! 

282
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,500
No... It's not a ghost.

283
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,125
What I saw looked like
part of the school

284
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,875
was collapsing in on itself.

285
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,000
[TONKYUN] Nothing appears
to be collapsing to me.

286
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,083
Nope, me either.

287
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,166
Oh...

288
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,416
Maybe I just... imagined it.

289
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,583
[TONKYUN]
According to the data

290
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,791
given to us by the
newspaper club,

291
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,291
the majority of eyewitness
reports about the ghost

292

are right around this corner.

Oh, nostalgia.

296
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,333
Thanks to not being
a member of a club,

297
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,916
Eruna was forced to
live in this hallway

298
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,166
before she moved into
Seisa's mansion, ryui.

299
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,791
Moments like these
make you think about

what life was like
on the other side.

301

Not to mention how far
I've come since then!

[KATAI giggles]

303
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,291
It's funny now,

304
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,375
but I remember when Eruna would
hop around in her sleeping bag,

305
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,166
and it would
completely terrify me

306
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,041
until I'd finally
realize it was her.

307
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,583
Oh yeah. I always thought it was

308
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,625
way too much trouble to get out
of the bag, so I'd just jump

309
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,666
to wherever I wanted to
go while I was still inside it!

310
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,000
Every time I saw you,

311
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,791
I thought for a sec you
were a ghost haunting me.

reporting the ghost to
be right around here?

316
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,208

According to the data we've got:

318
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,166
The ghost was an eerie face

319
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,750
that would appear out of
nowhere in the darkness.

320
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,500
That's what they said.

321
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,166
So you guys are
probably thinking

322
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,625
what I'm thinking, right?

323
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,250
[TONKYUN] You mean that the
ghost must have been Eruna

324
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,666
wandering around
in her sleeping bag?

325
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,708
Eh?

326
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,333
What? Really?

327
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,250
[laughs] No, that's hilarious!

328
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,375
You're so stupid.

329
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,458
Seriously?!

330
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,041
That's kind of a letdown

331
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,875
after we were thinking we were
gonna find a real life ghost!

332
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,166
[TONKYUN]
This is a problem.

333
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,416
You know that, right?

334
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,791
No?

335
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,416
[TONKYUN] When Rumina
asked if you were the ghost,

336
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,291
you denied it.

337
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,750
It'll look like you lied to her.

[ERUNA gasps]

the time you were making

340
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,458
a fool out of the
newspaper club.

341
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,333
Now, we have to fight to
get our good name back,

342
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,708
and it's completely your fault.

Unbelievably pissed.

Oh, right! Bimii!

Would you do me a favor?

Hey! Who are you, and
are you the perpetrator

354
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,458
purportedly pretending
to be a poltergeist?

Huh-uh.

I didn't just see a
genuine ghost, did I?

Answer the question, Seisa.

365

It's not that hard.

366
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,250
Fujishiro wants
to know the truth.

367
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,041
She wants to know why you
refuse to go see Eruna.

[SEISA sighs]

369
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,458
And here I thought your
presence would be interesting.

370
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,833
Eruna formed a new
club for you, Seisa.

371
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,000
You know she did,
so don't deny it.

372
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,666
Are you just égoïste?

373
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,791
[OTONE] Seems you're
selfish because even though

374
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,791
Eruna worked hard to form a club
specifically to make you happy,

375
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,791
doesn't look like you're
too happy for her.

376
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,458
And even though Eruna
has been waiting for you

377
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,833
to show up in support of her,

378
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,000
you don't seem to want
to do that, either.

379
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,166
Is it pride?

380
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,625
Will your precious
pride not allow you to

381
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,541
walk over there
and be kind to her?

382
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,250
Why? Because if Eruna
wants to see you,

383
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,125
she should be the one
making the effort?

384
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,875
Are you so special that
you can't be bothered

385
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,000
to make an effort for
anyone other than yourself?

386
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,041
Who are you?!

387
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,833
Rather, who do
you think you are?

388
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:49,875
A celebrity?

389
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,458
The Queen of Sheba?

390
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,125
Are you teasing her on purpose
to feel better about yourself?

391
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,333
Having fun leaving her
hanging like this?

392
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,625
You'd think you were
some child star

393
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:58,791
trying to make a comeback

394
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,208
but afraid everyone
will think you suck,

395
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,958
so you say you've been
spending time in the "theatre"

396

because you're a "real artist"

397
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,625
when really, you're just
an attention-seeking jerk

who wants to be worshipped!

00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,375
Well, guess what.
It's not very nice,

400
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,875
and it's an unbelievably
cruel way to treat Eruna.

00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:10,708
[SEISA chuckles]

402
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,041
Not that it matters to me,

403

lived abroad, did you?

Did you not notice?

You stopped trying to
Frenchify your words

407

somewhere in the middle of
that darling little speech.

So what?! That has nothing
to do with anything right now!

Let me ask you.

410
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:27,000
So what if I am all those
things you just called me?

How is my life any
of your business?

Why bother getting angry

about a situation that
in no way involves you?

behind what I saw?

that Mr. Bimii was even
able to turn into a human.

Oh yeah, that threw
me for a loop, too.

place supposed to be anyway?

Probably smart if we just forget

that whole thing ever happened.

taking a long time catching up.

around being lazy.

all by your lonesome self
in the dark of night,

That's not it, stupid.

But now that I think about
it, maybe I'm the stupid one

for thinking I needed to
tell you what I just saw.

[ERUNA]
Huh?

450
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,375

that girl from your club

with the purple
hair and Seisa.

they're about to fight.

Huh?

[ERUNA] Otone and
Seisa are gonna fight?

455
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,833
Your club doesn't have
anything to do with me,

456
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,875
and I don't have
anything to do with it.

Why waste your time
worrying about my actions

458
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,291
when you can do
whatever you want?

459
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,791
[OTONE] Because inside
Eruna, you're always there.

460

[SEISA gasps]

461
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,750
[OTONE] Because no matter how
much fun we might have together,

00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,875
she'd have more fun if
you were there, too.

463
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,666
You have to know she's
always thinking about you.

464
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,833
[OTONE] Fuji worries because
no matter how hard she tries,

465
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,583
Eruna keeps you in
a forbidden place

466
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,625
that Fujishiro cannot enter.

467
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,125
Wow.

468
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,000
It's really not
that big of a deal.

469
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,666
I just don't get you.

470
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,250
If I were in your shoes, I--

471
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,250
I would naturally want to stay
as far away from you as I could.

472
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,625
[OTONE] That might
be the smartest move,

473
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,250
but it would be selfish.

474
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,291
Besides Fujishiro isn't
worried about herself.

475
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,875
All I want is for
Eruna to be happy!

476
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,041
She understands me.

477
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:49,291
She was the first person to give
me a chance and be my friend.

478
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,541
To me, that girl is more
precious and cherished

479
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,250
than you will ever know.

480
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,958
[And what I feel for
her is stronger than

481
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,083
what anyone else might claim.

482
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,291
That includes you, too, Seisa.

483
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,500
Believe it.

484
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,833
[OTONE]
Now you understand why

485
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,875
I will do whatever it
takes to make you listen.

486
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,333
[SEISA]
Hm.

487
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,583
Whatever it takes, my goodness.

488
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,791
What could you do?

489
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:12,875
Anything?

490
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,791
[OTONE]
Won't know unless I try, will I?

491
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,375
I do hope winning
the rookie battle

492
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,958
didn't make you too
confident, Otone, dear.

493
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,458
You wouldn't want to get hurt.

494
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,416
Anticomplex!

495
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,708
Snake!

496
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,166
[OTONE grunts]

497
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,333
Are you seriously planning
to fight me with pink ribbons?

498
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,625
[OTONE grunts]

499
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,791
Sword!

500
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,166
[SEISA grunts]

501
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,083
[SEISA gasps]

502
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:57,750
[OTONE grunts]

503
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,750
[ERUNA panting]

504
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,208
I don't get any of this!

505
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,208
Why would they even be together?

506
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,250
[gasps]

507
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,125
Oh no. I'm too late!

508
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,666
[SEISA grunts]

509
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,708
[gasps]

510
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:21,708
Killing Art, go.

511
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:22,916
[OTONE grunts]

512
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,500
Rain down.

513
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,208
[SEISA gasps]

514
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,208
Fuji thought you were finally
going to use Killing Art.

515
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,583
[SEISA gasps]

516
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,083
Who's too confident, now?

517
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,791
You shouldn't
underestimate Fuji.

518
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:44,958
[SEISA grunts]

519
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,958
So do you think you're
too good for this?

520
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,708
Don't wanna waste your
treasured ability

521
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,541
on such a pathetic loser?

522
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,791
Is that how it is, Seisa?

523
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,666
You can't be bothered
to take out the trash?

524
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,500
Or is it so you have
an excuse to use

525
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,083
when you get your ass
kicked by Fujishiro?

526
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,500
You won't escape.

527
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,583
[SEISA yelps]

528
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,416
[grunts]

529
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,375
[OTONE]
Sword.

530
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,708
[OTONE] Even now, you refuse
use your ability on Fuji?

531
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:27,541
If you'd rather me win than
use Killing Art, then so be it.

532
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,583
When you lose,
remember, no excuses!

533
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:31,958
[ERUNA]
Otone, don't!

534
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,041
[OTONE gasps]

535
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,500
[ERUNA panting]

536
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,708
[OTONE growls]

537
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,333
What's going on?

538
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,083
One of you tell me!

539
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,125
[HIMI] Hey, hold on! We aren't
far from the last episode,

540
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:24,541
so why haven't I shown up yet
in a single preview?! How rude!

541
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:25,541
[ERUNA]
Don't worry, Himi!

542
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:26,958
I've been saving
this one for you!

543
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,958
Go ahead and preview
to your heart's content!

544
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,583
[HIMI]
Really? Here I go, then!

545
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,208
[KURUMI]
Just a moment, please.

546
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:35,041
I haven't been included in
a single preview, either.

547
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,750
[ERUNA] Why did I not
think of putting Miss Kurumi

548
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,166
and Himi together before?!

549
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,166
Well, then, ladies, knock
us out with a new preview

550
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,791
that no one has
ever, ever heard!

551
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,333
[BIMII]
Hey, hold on a minute, ladies.

552
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,250
Don't forget that I have
yet to do any previews

553
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:46,333
in my human form.

554
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:47,666
[ERUNA]
Bimii!

555
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,500
[HIMI] Meh... Thanks,
but no thanks, Mr. Bimii.

556
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,791
I think I can handle
this preview on my own.

557
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:52,916
[BIMII]
Negative.

558
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,416
I've got two hundred
and eighty-seven,

559
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,041
nine hundred and
twenty-eight thousand

560
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,583
nationwide fans waiting
for this moment.

561
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:01,041
I can't give that up, even
for you, darling Himi.

562
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,541
[ERUNA] Then why don't
we do it all at once?

563
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:04,958
[KURUMI] Because we hardly
need some lame preview

564
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:07,500
that sounds like a bunch of
pathetic students holding hands,

565
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:10,208
so they can all cross
the finish line at once.

566
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:12,666
Everyone can't
always get a medal.

567
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,166
Next time, "Nostalgic Triangle".

568
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,375
[HIMI] Aw! You went and said it!
No fair, Miss Kurumi!

569
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,375
[BIMII] They call that
stealing a march, mecha!

570
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:22,166
You're a disgrace
as a teacher, mecha!

571
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,500
[ERUNA]
Bimii, calm down!

572
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,208
You're ending your sentences
with "mecha" again!

573
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:28,791
[KURUMI] Next time, Lady Seisa's
past will finally be revealed.

574
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,125
[ERUNA]
What? Seisa's past, what?!

575
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:32,791
Now my heart's all a flutter!
