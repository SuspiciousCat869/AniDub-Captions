It was Mr. Bimii.

Well, uh...

There was somethin' in the sky?

12
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,583
It was flying over the
old school grounds?

I guess it was some
kinda oofo? Uh, UFO?

Yeah... I'm not usually

talked about my rocky mountains!

to make our new club a reality,

so we've come up
with a master plan!

First, we come up with
a scandalous story,

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,208
and we report it to
the newspaper club.

When they come out to cover
the faux news, we're there,

our recruitment signs

We get peoples' attention

89
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,250
with a crazy story,
and then we suck 'em in!

90

Before ya know it,
they'll be all,

91

"Maybe I should
join that new club."

92
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,125
It's farfetched, but it
could happen, right?

00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,500
Yeah! That's wicked smart!

94
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,833
Your signs'll have a
"suppository effect" on folks!

You mean a subliminal
effect, ryui.

covering this like a real story,

of different ideas,

but nothing solid.

139

I'm not worried; I'm sure it'll
come to me sooner or later.

140

Dontcha think you should figure
out the purpose of your club

141
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,208
before you start
recruiting new members?

Nah.

143
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,083
We haven't shifted away
from the basic concept of

surrounding yours truly
with as many cute girls

as we can possibly
squish in a club room

gonna be just fine.

shift away from that
concept altogether, ryui.

149

If worse comes to worst,
we might have to think about

recruiting people
from other clubs.

and I gotta tell you,
I'm totally a fan.

It's good to see that
you're not sugary sweet

all the time, y'know?

315
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
I seriously love this whole
bossy thing you got going on,

316
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,291
but you might've come
on a little too strong

317
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,458
with those girls.

[ERUNA]
Otone, wait up!

321
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,166
Why're you running away?

322
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,916
Are you disappointed with Fuji?

323
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,291
Huh?

324
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,458
We've both worked really hard

325
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,666
trying to find members
for our club.

326
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,666
We finally get two
potential recruits,

327
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,250
and instead of welcoming
them with a smile...

328
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,291
...Fujishiro went
and scared them away!

329
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,666
Don't be silly,

330
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,166
I'm sure they know you were
just messing with them.

331
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,791
I mean, you're gonna go
after them, aren't ya?

332
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,125
Be all super sweet and ask
if they wanna join us.

333

That's your plan, right?
Please tell me that's your plan.

334

No, je suis désolé.

Fuji wanted to scare them off.

"Jay-Z desortee" means
you're kidding, right?

Huh?

341
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,458
Fujishiro knows that we
need members and fast.

342
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:49,708
She would hate for our dreams

343
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,208
of starting an awesome
new club to be ruined.

344
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,541
She feels torn.

345
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,125
She wants for you to be happy,

346
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,000
but deep down she knew
she had no choice,

347
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,291
but to scare the
other girls away!

348
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,375

349
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,291
Mm-hm.

00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,625
Okay... But why?

351
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,541
'Cause... Fuji is spoiled.

352
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,208
She doesn't want to share you.

353
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,750
You're her favorite person.

354
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,750
She likes having you to herself.

355
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,333
She doesn't want new members
to ruin her friendship.

356
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,041
I would never let that happen!

It doesn't matter how many
people join the club,

you and I are always
gonna be friends, Otone.

Whatever!

[OTONE]
Fujishiro's always been a loner,

363
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,958
but she finally made a friend.

364
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,041
She cares so much
for you, Eruna.

365
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,291
She'd be heartbroken if someone
were to ever come between you.

366
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,250
That's why she scared
all those girls away.

367

You could never
understand Fuji's pain

'cause you've got
lots of friends.

What do you mean by
"all those girls"?

Just how many
have you scared off?

Too many to count!

Fuji knew that it was wrong,
but she couldn't help herself.

373

Eruna's the only friend she has.

here in front of the window.

00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,041
she attempted to make
Valentine's chocolates

470
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,708
for her beloved, but she
failed spectacularly.

471
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,583
When she gave Shigure
the misshapen treats,

472
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,583
he said, "They're ugly but
they still taste good!"

that she was--

Okay, okay, I think
we've all heard enough!

It's really easy when you're a
member of the newspaper club.

People come to us with all
kinds of scandalous stories.

It was Shigure, wasn't it?

00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,875
I'm gonna strangle that creep
for spilling all my secrets!

[OTONE]
What?!

482
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,541
You're trying to tell Fuji that
everything Rumina said is true?

483
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,333
No, you've got it
all wrong, Otone!

484
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,583
[RUMINA] We interrupt this
convo for a special report!

For her ninth birthday,

486
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,625
Shigure surprised Eruna
with an original rap,

487
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,625
and she was so touched that
she was moved to tears.

488
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,041
Fuji doesn't know
who's creepier,

489
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,208
Shigure for writing you a
rap song for your birthday

490
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,833
or you for crying about it.

For Shigure's birthday
that same year,

00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,916
Eruna surprised him
with an original rap,

495
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,458
and he said, "Thanks but don't
give up your day job, kiddo!"

496
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,208
And she was so touched that
she was moved to tears.

[OTONE gasps]
What happened?

498
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,333
Why did Eruna's
crystal just break?

[ERUNA gasps]

She didn't receive
any physical damage.

Wait, was it you?

502
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,958
You see, a funny thing happens

503
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,458
whenever people get
excruciatingly embarrassed.

504
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,833
They don't want
to fight anymore,

505
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,083
they just want to curl
into a little ball and hide.

506
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,333
The stress causes them
to subconsciously destroy

--their own crystals.

My enemies drop like flies
thanks to my special power.

Wow, this was almost too easy.

Aw, c'mon, you still
have one crystal left,

and I haven't even pulled
out the big guns yet.

What, all of a sudden,
you wanna fight back?

Okay! Here's a news flash!

529
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,916
When Eruna was twelve
years old, she asked Shigure--

530
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,750
She asked him to go to the--

No... Why isn't it
working anymore?

Take her down, Tension max!

Go!

I totally trashed
that bully! [laughs]

00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,666
And now, the super cool
clubroom is ours!

Yeah!

[RUMINA]
Whatever.

540
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,791
It's not like your
win matters anyway.

541
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,958
See, your club needs
at least three members.

542
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,125
And you've got two.

[RUMINA]
You know what that means.

545
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,250
If you can't come up
with another member,

546
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,833
then your request
will be denied,

547
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,333
and this "super cool clubroom"
will go to the newspaper club.

You wasted all that
energy for nothing.

Oh, and just so we're clear,

publicize your club.

C'mon, Eruna.

we would fall for that?

There were lots of people
interested in joining.

That's all in the past, Otone.

Well, since you don't
have enough members,

558

I think it's safe to say

I'm telling you, I saw it!

624
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:07,750
[NYAMIRIN] The nameplate
on Tonkyun's house?

625
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:09,208
[TONKYUN] My house
doesn't have one of those.

626
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,625
[ERUNA] So, just what was
it then that Usamaru saw?!

627
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:14,083
[KUMANO]
You'll find out next time! Roar!
