1
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,250
[SEISA]
I have a question, Eruna.

2
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,416
Care to join me at my mansion?

3
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,416
What? For real?

4
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,666
Yes, for real.

5
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,416
I know you're
just a trial member,

6
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,958
but you're still a part
of the going-home club, right?

7
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:56,375
Now come home with me,
and let's live together, okay?

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,291
Oh, Seisa, yes!

9
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,250
[ERUNA]
Uh... Yuriko?!

10
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,333
[ERUNA yells]

11
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,333
[sighs, groans]

12
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,541
[ERUNA] I thought joining
a club for a trial period

13
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,875
would change something.

14
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,333
[BIMII] Some things
have changed, ryui.

15
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,625
You have a whole minute of
shower time, which is nice.

16
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,041
And look in front of you.

17
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,333
I see an extra side dish!

18
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,458
Right.

19
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,458
Yeah, I can work with this
sticky, gooey bean situation.

20
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:11,125
I'll just pretend it's a fancy
breakfast in a cushy castle!

21
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,416
Look, a full-course French meal!

22
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,708
I'll start with foie gras
with caviar on top!

23
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,333
Oh. Yeah, yum.

24
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,625
Seems kinda heavy
for breakfast to me, ryui.

25
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,041
[stomach growling]

26
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,250
What was I thinking?

27
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,916
I can't fill my stomach
with my imagination.

28
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,375
Now then.

29
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,833
I'm sure those of you who
came from our middle school

30
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,833
are already well aware of this,

31
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,541
but please understand
that I need to explain

32
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,666
how club battles work
for our new students.

33
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,750
Okay.

34
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,125
Why don't we start with
the idiot over there?

35
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,375
I mean, uh...

36
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,458
Eruna Ichinomiya,
come to the front.

37
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,666
Oh! Yes, ma'am!

38
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,416
[stomach growling]

39
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,625
[ERUNA]
Pink bananas!

40
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,250
[KURUMI]
No, they're not fruit.

41
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,666
These are crystals used
in the club battles.

42
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,375
The competitor that successfully
breaks all three crystals

43
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,958
floating around
their opponent first

44
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,333
within the allotted time
is the winner.

45
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,541
[KURUMI]
As you see...

46
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,625
You can crush them
with your hands like so.

47
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,250
--Now.
--[ERUNA yells]

48
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,083
Biting them is an option,

49
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,750
but if you'd rather not
experience that unpleasantness,

50
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,583
you can release
your own individual powers

51
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,125
and hit them with
your special attacks.

52
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,416
[ERUNA]
Huh? Who what?

53
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,250
[bell ringing]

54
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,625
Sorry to keep you waiting!

55
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,416
I am finally here, though!

56
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,708
Now, for the entrance
you've been longing for!

57
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,125
I worked on this for you ladies.

58
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,541
[GIRL 2A] It's Shigure Ninomiya
from the manga club!

59
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,250
[GIRL 2B] Eruna,
have you met this guy yet?

60
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,791
Yeah, he's a pervert
with a major cuz-com.

61
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:43,958
Cuz-com?

62
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,750
Cousin complex, like, bad.

63
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,083
No shame, cuz.

64
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,458
This complex guy's about
to drop a special attack!

65
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,541
I call it Hero Time!

66
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,333
Huh...? What? Uh...

67
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,708
[SHIGURE]
What am I gonna do?!

68
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,708
I forgot my pen and
left it back in my room!

69
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,916
[screams]

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,416
[BIMII] If you want
to release your powers,

71
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,583
you're gonna have
to get yourself

72
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,541
some sort of a
summoning object, ryui.

73
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,125
In the case of
your twisted cousin,

74
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,583
he likes to use
a pen since he's

75
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,333
in the manga
research club, ryui.

76
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,750
I don't really get that.

77
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,291
But are you telling me
I have special powers?

78
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,708
Oh gosh, no.

79
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,083
Unfortunately, power like his
does not live inside you

80
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,250
as of yet.

81
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,000
However, since you
were accepted here,

82
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,208
you're definitely going to.

83
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,416
I got it!

84
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,833
What I should do is
get Seisa to teach me

85
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,833
everything she
knows about this stuff!

86
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:29,583
Genius!

87
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,916
It'll be after school!

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,166
A club activity!

89
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,625
I just know she'll help!

90
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,458
--Seisa, I need you!
--[BIMII] Hey, not so fast!

91
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:37,833
[doorbell rings]

92
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,375
I'm here to do
club activities, Seisa!

93
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,708
Question, Eruna.

94
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,625
Do you even know what
the going-home club does?

95
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,333
[ERUNA] Nope!
That's why I came over!

96
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,875
Take me by the hand and show me!

97
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,666
In fact, show me all
kinds of things if you want!

98
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,375
[SEISA]
All right.

99
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,666
Lesson one. Turn around.

100
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,916
Okay!

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,916
[SEISA] Next, put your
right foot in front.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,125
[ERUNA]
Okay!

103
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,458
[SEISA] Then, put your
left foot in front.

104
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,791
[ERUNA]
Okay!

105
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,166
[SEISA] Repeat that three
hundred and fifty times,

106
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,166
give or take a hundred.

107
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,875
[ERUNA]
Okay! Hey! Wait a minute!

108
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,458
The going-home club's
club activity

109
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,916
is going home, ryui.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,625
[SEISA]
See you later.

111
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,833
I don't wanna go!

112
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,708
[ERUNA]
So, Himi,

113
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,791
all I want is for you to take me
by the hand and show me!

114
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,666
[HIMI] I need more details
than what you're throwing at me,

115
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,208
'cause it seems like you want me
to be Seisa's replacement.

116
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,541
No, that's not how it is.

117
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,916
Think more like
being in the mood

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,125
to have dessert
for breakfast.

119
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,208
Dessert?!

120
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,750
Cool, I'm down
for any kind of sundae

121
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,083
as long as there's
a strawberry on top!

122
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,833
That's not what
I meant, either.

123
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,166
I know! Like how the
kind of person you'd marry

124
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,166
is different than the
kind of person you'd date.

125
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,916
Still not
making any sense, ryui.

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,500
That's weird.

127
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,916
Why date someone if you don't
like 'em enough to get married?

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,291
Either way,
what's important to me

129
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,041
is that I'm with the
kind of person who also saves

130
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,583
the strawberry
on sundaes for last.

131
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,958
[ERUNA]
Hey, I do that!

132
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,125
In that case, Eruna,
let's save our special attacks

133
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:56,166
for a special day and
keep them a secret until then.

134
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,125
What kind of special day?

135
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:02,666
[BOTH laughing]

136
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,625
Oh jeez, where did
your mind just go, ryui?

137
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:06,833
[HIMI]
Seriously though, Eruna,

138
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,416
if you want to learn
about the club battles

139
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,750
and special attacks,

140
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,166
you should go visit the
other clubs and ask them.

141
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,416
[BIMII] The art club shows up
regularly in the top ten, ryui.

142
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,208
Wasn't that scary guy
from this club?

143
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,708
I don't know if
I wanna talk to him.

144
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,000
[BIMII]
Don't worry, ryui.

145
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,416
Kuzuryu might look
hardcore on the outside,

146
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,333
but under that tough exterior
is a pretty good guy.

147
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,125
[ERUNA]
Attention, please!

148
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,875
It's Eruna Ichinomiya!

149
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,750
The last great
new student has arrived!

150
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,250
[KUZURYU]
What?

151
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,708
[ERUNA]
Uh, hey, uh...

152
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,708
What's up?

153
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,166
Okay, he's a good guy.
He's just quiet, ryui.

154
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,083
Not exactly into
the "talking" thing.

155
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,375
[ERUNA]
Well that's no help.

156
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,541
[ERUNA]
Attention please!

157
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,125
It's Eruna Ichinomiya!

158
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,750
The last great
new student has arrived!

159
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,625
[ERUNA]
Holy crap!

160
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,166
What is this?
The Mikagura school

161
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,416
of making flowers look
stupid awesome together?

162
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,708
[MINATOGAWA] No, it's
the Minatogawa school.

163
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,875
Everything you see
was arranged by me.

164
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,583
Meet Sadamatsu Minatogawa.

165
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,791
He is the president of the
flower arrangement club.

166
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,750
Your flowers kick ass!

167
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,791
[BIMII]
The flower arrangement club

168
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,708
is also a regular
in the top ten,

169
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,000
but they have fewer and
fewer members each year.

170
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,041
That's why this is
now basically a clubroom

171
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,416
just for Minatogawa, ryui.

172
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,625
His power is called
Selfish Flower, ryui.

173
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,791
It allows him to
manipulate plant life.

174
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,875
[MINATOGAWA]
Eruna, do you like flowers?

175
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,000
If they're yummy!

176
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,958
You can't eat flowers, ryui.

177
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,000
Why?

178
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,083
The yellow ones
they always give you

179
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,708
when you order sashimi
are delicious.

180
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,416
You can't eat those, ryui!

181
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,166
To be honest,
I'd rather you not eat

182
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,833
any flowers at all.

183
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,000
They're alive. See?

184
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,541
Right?

185
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,291
[ERUNA] That oughta cover
at least one meal for today!

186
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,333
[BIMII] Eruna, you forgot what
you were trying to do, ryui.

187
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,500
[ERUNA]
That's right!

188
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,000
Attention please!

189
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,416
It's Eruna Ichinomiya!

190
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,375
The last great
new student has arrived!

191
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,500
[BIMII] The drama club is
one of the most popular clubs

192
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,833
in the school.

193
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,958
It ranks high in both
members and points, ryui.

194
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,708
[ERUNA]
No way I'll lose in acting.

195
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,458
You may not realize
you've been socializing

196
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,625
with an actress extraordinaire,
but this particular girl

197
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,458
has been cast in the
pivotal role of "Tree"

198
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,750
every year since kindergarten.

199
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:31,833
[GIRL]
Oh, yay!

200
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,625
It's the most
adorable teacher ever!

201
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,750
[BIMII] No, let go,
I can't breathe, ryui!

202
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,083
Her chest is huge!

203
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,750
Hey, what'd you say?

204
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,958
You know, something about
being the last student?

205
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,916
[ERUNA] No, I said
the last great student!

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,875
[NYAMIRIN] Grate?
Like grating on our nerves?

207
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,208
[ERUNA]
Great like cool!

208
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,833
[NYAMIRIN] You're cold.
That explains the layers!

209
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,291
Okay, I think I'm starting
to get offended here,

210
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,208
unless you're special needs
or something, maybe?

211
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,875
[BOY] What's going on?
It's so loud.

212
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,375
[ERUNA]
Hey!

213
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,583
I saw that guy at the new
student welcoming party thing.

214
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,083
I'm Yuto Akama,
the drama club rep.

215
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,166
Nice to meet you!

216
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,541
Nice to meet you, too!

217
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,916
[BIMII] Eruna is trying
to find out more

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,041
about different special
attacks for the club battles

219
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,625
by going around to everyone
and asking what they do, ryui.

220
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,916
[YUTO]
Oh? Sounds like a good plan.

221
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,083
Have you been to the
astronomy club already?

222
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,125
No, not yet, ryui.

223
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,375
Why, is the
astronomy club awesome?

224
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,375
No.

225
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,208
Well, not when
compared to drama.

226
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,000
[YUTO]
This is my special attack.

227
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,833
Coup d'Etat Faker!

228
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,458
I play tricks on your eyes.
Nice, right?

229
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,958
[KUZURYU] Even though
you're in the going-home club,

230
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,333
you haven't gone home yet?

231
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,125
[SEISA] No. I just
got to school, so...

232
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,875
Eruna Ichinomiya.

233
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,458
A funny girl.

234
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,083
Are you as stressed
about her as it seems you are?

235
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,791
[ERUNA]
Everyone's incredible.

236
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,250
I wish I knew what to do

237
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,750
to be able to use some sort
of sweet power like them.

238
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,375
[BIMII]
There's no use rushing, ryui.

239
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,750
It just takes time.

240
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,583
As long as you train
your mind and your body,

241
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,583
it'll come to you eventually.

242
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:25,666
[ERUNA] Wow! I've never
seen so many stars!

243
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,833
[BIMII] Are you listening
to anything I say, ryui?

244
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,375
[ASUHI]
Oh, hey!

245
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,791
You're Eruna Ichinomiya,
aren't you?

246
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,666
When Seisa invited
you to join her club,

247
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,208
were you blown away?

248
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,500
[BIMII] Asuhi's here right now
because the astronomy club

249
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,750
is scheduled for
activities tonight, ryui.

250
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,208
[ERUNA]
Astronomy?

251
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,333
Um, isn't that the one Akama
said wasn't all that good?

252
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,416
Shut it!

253
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,750
The astronomy club
is all that good.

254
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,333
It's a top ranking club, ryui!

255
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,958
That's true.

256
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,708
[BIMII] Why aren't the other
astronomy members here?

257
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,416
Oh, I'm just early,
that's all.

258
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,458
This is my first
astronomical observation

259
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,458
since I started
high school, so uh...

260
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,916
I'm... I'm excited.

261
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,541
I thought more
people would come earlier,

262
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,333
but it looks like
I'm the only one.

263
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,541
Confusing!

264
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,791
Is this really a boy?
I'm freaking out.

265
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,500
He's like the epitome of
everything I love in a girl!

266
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,000
[BIMII]
Asuhi may be a new student,

267
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,833
but he's already the
astronomy club rep, ryui.

268
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,500
He's incredibly gifted
for such a young kiddo.

269
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,708
Thank you!

270
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,041
But I still have
so much more to learn!

271
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,916
[ERUNA] Hey, can I see
what that's all about?

272
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,791
[ASUHI]
Oh, sure.

273
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,250
Gimme a minute, first, though.

274
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,125
I'll adjust it some so
it'll be easier for you.

275
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,166
What a sweetie!

276
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,791
[ASUHI]
'Kay, go for it!

277
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,416
Thanks, man!

278
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,666
[ERUNA laughing]

279
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,708
[ASUHI]
Isn't it lovely?

280
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,250
Stars show us
different expressions

281
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,625
depending upon the time of day.

282
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,916
I never get bored, even if
I look at them all the time.

283
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,125
How sweet!

284
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,750
I feel like I could
stare up there forever.

285
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,333
Wait! No, don't push that.

286
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,375
[ERUNA]
This?

287
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,166
[screams]

288
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,083
Oh, shoot.
I'm so sorry, Eruna!

289
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,166
That power is
called My Shooting Star.

290
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,291
The telescope fills up
with energy from the stars

291
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,166
to fire with.

292
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,791
But it's kind of a big flaw.

293
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,875
Anyone who manages to hit
the button can fire it

294
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,166
as long as the bullets
have been loaded.

295
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,708
That is so cool!

296
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,083
How did you get your power,
and how did you learn to use it?

297
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,208
[ASUHI]
Oh. I guess I...

298
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,166
I don't really know.

299
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,708
I like stars, so I grew up
always looking at them.

300
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,791
In fact, I've been
stargazing way earlier

301
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,666
than elementary school.

302
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,958
Before I knew it,
I had this neat power.

303
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,375
[ERUNA] All righty, the keyword
is "before I knew it"

304
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,416
and that's true, "good things
come to those who wait."

305
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,041
[BIMII] Isn't that
more of a key "cliché"?

306
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,250
[ERUNA]
Don't you judge me!

307
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,625
[BIMII] Instead of
getting angry, missy,

308
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:48,708
you might want to focus on

309
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,416
getting rid of
that sleeping bag, ryui.

310
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,083
[ERUNA]
Oh, hey--

311
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,333
Yeah, what?

312
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,916
[ERUNA] It seems like Seisa
probably doesn't

313
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,375
want me to know,

314
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,291
but, uh, what kind of power
is that girl working with?

315
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,958
Seisa's power is
called Killing Art, ryui.

316
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,750
It's the only power
in the entire school

317
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,708
that can be activated
without an item, ryui.

318
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,291
Yeah, she's kind of
a big deal, as they say.

319
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,041
And the best part about it...

320
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,333
Oh, my goddess!

321
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,291
Screw that
"before I knew it" crap!

322
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,875
I'm going to do
an intensive training

323
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,125
and learn a super sick
attack just like her!

324
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,333
You can practice your
special attack on me, Eruna!

325
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,041
I'll just wait right here.

326
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,041
Oh, dreams do come true.

327
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,958
Imagine me, her first partner.

328
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,416
He is so gross.

329
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,625
But, instead of puking on him,
I just won't hold back.

330
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:29,916
What's your item, ryui?

331
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,458
Since I'm in
the going-home club,

332
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,708
I thought I'd use this.

333
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:33,625
Give it a shot.

334
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,250
Eruna! Come to me!

335
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,291
School Bag... Crash!

336
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,458
Unless I'm wrong,

337
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,083
you're just hitting him
with your bag, ryui.

338
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,708
Fine, then I'll use this!

339
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:46,916
Eruna, come to--

340
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,541
[ERUNA]
Go, Sleeping Beauty!

341
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,208
[BIMII]
Still just hitting him, ryui.

342
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,375
[ERUNA]
Okay, maybe this?

343
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,041
[SHIGURE]
Eruna! Come to me!

344
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,583
Things we don't say out loud!

345
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,291
Here goes!

346
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,916
[yelling]

347
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,875
[ERUNA]
Bimii!

348
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,250
Yes! I did it!

349
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,458
We're spending the night
in the nurse's office! Yay!

350
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,041
[BIMII]
Focus, ryui!

351
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,541
[ERUNA]
In my fantasies,

352
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,750
I can activate techniques
like "this," and "that,"

353
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,541
and "What? Get out!"

354
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:35,083
But in the lame real world,
things are way harder and suck.

355
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,166
[ERUNA]
Seisa, hey!

356
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,541
I suppose it's
impossible for you after all.

357
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,375
What? No, that's not true!

358
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,708
So you say.

359
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,791
But I don't understand
how you're going to fight.

360
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,083
Don't you worry!

361
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,583
I'll prove that I can do it!

362
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,833
Trust me!

363
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,416
I want to win so I can
become an official part

364
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,333
of the going-home
club with you, Seisa!

365
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,625
[SEISA] The going-home club
just goes home.

366
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,291
It doesn't matter
if I allow you to join or not.

367
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,416
We go home. That's it.

368
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,916
There's nothing
for us to do together.

369
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,791
[ERUNA]
We can go home together!

370
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,208
[SEISA] I live in a mansion
and have a feather bed.

371
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,000
You live in an open room
and have a sleeping bag.

372
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,666
Your solution is not an option.

373
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,583
[ERUNA]
Then what if we go halfway?

374
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,125
We can stop
somewhere on the road,

375
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,500
or go the long route?

376
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,416
Ooh, what if we stop
at an ice cream shop

377
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,583
and stuff our faces
till we get brainfreeze?

378
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,125
We'll get stomachaches and have
to go to the nurse's office.

379
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,958
Come on, how much fun
does that sound, right?

380
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,208
We can do anything!

381
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,166
It'll be on the way home!

382
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,083
[ERUNA] The only reason I
wanted to come to this academy

383
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,916
was because I saw you
in that pamphlet,

384
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,833
which was love
at first sight for me.

385
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,250
I mean, have you seen you?

386
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,791
Who wouldn't want
to go to the same school

387
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,666
with someone that gorgeous?

388
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,333
And then you invited me
to join the going-home club

389
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,333
out of nowhere.

390
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,250
It made me so happy!

391
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,291
Your point?

392
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,333
My point?

393
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,958
My point is
I'm gonna rock this!

394
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,041
[BIMII] We will begin
the match, now, ryui!

395
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,916
I didn't know
I was gonna fight Himi.

396
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,958
[HIMI]
Surprise!

397
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,500
You should be proud of yourself

398
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,916
for already being the going-home
club representative, Eruna.

399
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That's really such a
huge honor for you!

400
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,875
And after I beat you
like I'm about to do,

401
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,750
you can be even more proud!

402
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,041
Yeah, says the
loser from Loserville.

403
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,458
[BIMII] The time limit
is one hour, ryui.

404
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,208
Whoever breaks all three of
their opponent's crystals first

405
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,416
wins the match.

406
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,083
[ERUNA] Uh... where's
my crowd of screaming fans?

407
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,750
[BIMII] Oh, the other
students get to watch

408
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,875
from wherever
they want to, ryui.

409
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,416
The match will be broadcast
to their phones and what-not

410
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,083
from cameras installed
around the school, ryui.

411
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,166
[BIMII]
Ready, now?

412
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,541
If so, let's get this started!

413
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,458
[DEVICE]
Begin the match.

414
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,708
[ERUNA yelling]

415
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,583
I won't let you get away!

416
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,708
[ERUNA]
I could ambush her here!

417
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,625
[HIMI]
Eruna!

418
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,833
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

419
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,375
It's time to eat!

420
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,750
Ooh, good news!

421
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,333
There are girls wandering
around the school

422
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,583
in nothing but swimsuits!

423
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,291
You don't wanna
miss this opportunity.

424
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,000
Eruna!

425
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,625
[ERUNA]
Do people think I'm that dumb?

426
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,041
I mean, come on!

427
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,208
Hey, you don't have to
run away from me, newest bestie!

428
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,416
[ERUNA] I'll get the
first one when I jump down,

429
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,375
grab the second
before she turns around,

430
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,416
and then take the third
as she aims for my crystal.

431
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
I'm so gonna crush this.

432
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,500
Hi! I've been looking for you!

433
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,916
[ERUNA]
She's a psychic!

434
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,875
Remember, you're in
a battle with Himi.

435
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,208
You're not clever enough
to trick me, silly.

436
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,041
[ERUNA yelling]

437
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,666
[HIMI]
Wait!

438
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,750
[ERUNA]
Huh?

439
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,833
Well, that looks pleasant.

440
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,375
[ERUNA] Okay, what's
the deal with this room?

441
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,958
[SPIRIT GIRL]
Eruna...

442
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,625
You are a descendant
of the chosen line.

443
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Now, you must awaken yourself.

444
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:16,708
Never forget.

445
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,708
This power has always
been a part of you.

446
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,875
[ERUNA]
Weird.

447
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,583
"Is this real or a fantasy"
moment alert.

448
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,166
Who was she, though?

449
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,416
[HIMI]
I found you!

450
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,333
You're not allowed
to come in here, silly.

451
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,625
Uh hold on! Wait!

452
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,333
Sorry!

453
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,666
I'm kinda starving,

454
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,041
but I can't hit up
snack time until I finish you.

455
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,541
[HIMI]
What's going on here?

456
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,541
Did she awaken?

457
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,208
Aw man, not now!

458
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,166
[ERUNA]
Crazy. My body feels so light!

459
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,750
[HIMI]
Lovely Ink!

460
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,875
[ERUNA]
Pawn?!

461
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,791
Not sure what this is,
but man, do I like it!

462
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,041
Oh, no!

463
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,708
[yells]

464
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,041
[ERUNA]
Shoji?

465
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,083
So this is a battle?

466
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,083
It's crazy fun!

467
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:49,708
That's check.

468
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,500
[ERUNA]
Why are we playing shoji?!

469
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,375
[SPIRIT GIRL]
Now, you must awaken yourself.

470
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,583
Never forget.

471
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,458
This power has always
been a part of you.

472
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,500
[ERUNA] Aw yeah! No way!
This is my power?!

473
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,875
Tension max! Go!

474
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,041
[yelling]

475
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,458
Seriously?

476
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:28,958
How did she do that
without having an item?

477
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,000
[ERUNA]
Did I win?

478
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,041
No way.

479
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,708
Ha, sorry I
kicked your butt, Himi!

480
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,083
[SHIGURE]
Eruna's finally awakened.

481
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,333
That's my girl.

482
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,458
[SHIGURE] Congratulations
on your first victory, Eruna!

483
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,208
[ERUNA] The mighty
Eruna Ichinomiya's power

484
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:24,750
has finally awakened,
and it's called Toy Gun!

485
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,000
But wait, a new assassin
appears before her,

486
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,000
and the villain
is named Modded Himi!

487
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,958
[BIMII] Or nothing
like that happens, ryui!

488
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,333
[ERUNA]
Well not yet!

489
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:33,791
If I keep believing, though,
someday she'll appear!

490
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:36,166
Besides, everyone has a
little Modded Himi in them!

491
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,125
[SHIGURE]
I see her!

492
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,500
[BIMII]
Are you serious, ryui?

493
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,083
[ERUNA]
For a Modded Himi, 

494
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,791
start by fastening the arms and
legs of a freshly-caught Himi

495
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,083
to an operating table.

496
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,666
Then, you'll want to rub
some seaweed and kelp

497
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,208
into her face. They're full
of nutrients and minerals,

498
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:48,750
like arginine and stuff.

499
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:51,541
So while you're making her skin
all smooth and silky soft...

500
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,458
[SHIGURE]
Yes! Do me next, Eruna!

501
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:56,541
Mod me that way, too!

502
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,666
[BIMII] Next time,
"Not Quite a Heroine"!

503
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,541
Modded Himi not included.
