00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,583
[grunting]

4
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,958
You don't have to do this!
Please stop!

5
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,916
[SEISA]
Don't do it!

6
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,458
Forgive me for calling
you out here like this.

7
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,166
I--I just couldn't hold it in.

8
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,458
Yuriko...

9
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:22,583
I can't hide my feelings,
and I refuse to try!

10
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:32,208
[ERUNA] Okay, but we
shouldn't do this now.

11
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,666
Not right here.

12
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,125
[YURIKO gasps]

13
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,791
[ERUNA] So let's go
to the nurse's office

14
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,708
where there's
no one around!

15
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,291
[BOTH giggling]

16
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,166
[ERUNA giggling]

17
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,041
[ERUNA'S MOM]
Eruna! Eruna! Eruna!

18
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,458
What, Ma?

19
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,375
We're doing a special
vision test with a love letter

20
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:51,666
in the nurse's office right now,

21
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,875
so come back later,
'kay, thanks!

22
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,916
[ERUNA'S MOM]
Fantasizing again, are we?

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,875
Well, your future is real!

24
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,833
Apply to a high school already!

25
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,625
Do you even know
how long it's been

26
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:02,833
since the holiday started?

27
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:03,833
[ERUNA] That's right,
it's Golden Week! 

28
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,291
I still gotta be Golden Week!

29
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,666
Come on, Eruna, you can
do anything if you just try!

30
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,333
[ERUNA'S MOM] Do not use
nonsense to avoid this,

31
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,375
young lady!

32
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,375
I don't get it.

33
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,875
How can someone
be so unconcerned

34
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,916
about eventually
living in a gutter?

35
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,458
That's not a compliment!

36
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,791
Right.

37
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,166
You know I'm a week that
likes to be complimented!

38
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,375
[ERUNA'S MOM]
You are not Golden W

39
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,750
Now knock that crap off!

40
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,000
Apply to a school,
and when you get accepted

41
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,000
I promise not to bug you
about it anymore.

42
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,166
Okay? Okay?

43
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:30,708
[ERUNA]
'Kay.

44
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:34,875
[bell chiming]

45
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,583
So have you decided where
you want to go yet, Eruna?

46
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,791
[ERUNA]
Nope, not at all.

47
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,541
What about that school
just out of town?

48
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,041
[ERUNA]
Uniforms aren't cute enough.

49
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,750
That's really your reason?

50
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,000
Uniforms are important!

51
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,541
I mean, if I have to wear
something ugly,

52
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,625
I might as well live in a
freakin' gutter!

53
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,250
Seems kinda dramatic.

54
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,541
Look, I want
to have a career

55
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,416
where I get
to watch TV all day.

56
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,250
Why should I have to go to
school for that?

57
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:02,000
[FRIENDS] Eruna,
watching TV isn't a career.

58
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,958
[ERUNA groans]
This is lame.

59
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,791
Why aren't there
any fun jobs out there?

60
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,208
[gasps]

61
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,541
[YURIKO]
Eruna! Oh, Eruna!

62
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,833
Are you all right?

63
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:40,875
Yuriko?

64
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,250
Oh no!

65
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,250
We must be the only people
left alive in the whole world.

66
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,125
[ERUNA]
Everything will be fine.

67
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,000
We can make it together.
Just us two.

68
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,083
But first... I have an idea.

69
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,666
[YURIKO gasps]

70
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,500
[ERUNA] Let's go
to the nurse's office!

71
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,541
[BOTH laughing]

72
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,166
[laughing creepily]

73
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,375
[SHIGURE] You know,
whenever I find you,

74
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,041
you're always behind that thing.

75
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,541
[ERUNA] Shigure,
how come you're here?

76
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,583
I got permission
from my dorm to come here.

77
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,791
All I had to do was tell them

78
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,291
I had to go see
the cutie known as you.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,416
Don't make a face like that!

80
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,833
I'm your cousin,
not your brother,

81
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,500
so we could totally have
normal kids together, probably!

82
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,000
[ERUNA groans]
So many levels of gross.

83
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,541
[SHIGURE yells]

84
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,708
[ERUNA] Well, spit it out.
What do you want?

85
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,291
[SHIGURE] You know,
your mom is spreading a rumor

86
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,208
that you have yet to decide what
school you're gonna apply to.

87
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,500
[ERUNA]
Hmph!

88
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,583
[SHIGURE] If that's true,
what about this one?

89
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,083
It's my school,
Mikagura Academy.

90
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:52,833
Let me see here...

91
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,125
Their uniforms are cute,
so that's a plus.

92
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,041
Cool! Everyone lives in dorms?

93
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,833
Gotta love all the
cultural clubs, too.

94
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:03,166
And not like you're gonna find
another school like it, either.

95
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,750
Oh, and by the way...
I'm Manga Research Club Prez.

96
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,458
[SHIGURE]
Hey, don't ignore me!

97
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,250
I mean, yeah, I get it,
but just a heads up,

98
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,500
a little bit of interest this
direction wouldn't hurt you any.

99
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,291
[sighs]

100
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,500
Eruna, you're
kinda drooling there.

101
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,250
[yells]

102
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,291
[SHIGURE yells]

103
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,916
An angel!
She's the real deal!

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,083
I can't believe a girl this
perfect really exists!

105
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,666
Wait a sec, aren't
Photoshopped models

106
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,875
used for this sort of stuff?

107
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,375
It's like the difference
between pictures

108
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,000
of a fast food burger
and the mushy reality.

109
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,916
Yeah, good call.
I'd like a burger.

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,958
But if we do fast food,
I'm getting a double.

111
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,875
[ERUNA]
Pay attention!

112
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,500
[SHIGURE] If you're curious,
the girl in the photo

113
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,125
is Seisa Mikagura.

114
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,625
She's the granddaughter
of the principal.

115
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:06,625
Hey, you know what?

116
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,458
Go ahead and get
yourself a burger.

117
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,666
Grab me some nuggets
while you're a--huh?

118
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,625
Wait, don't go anywhere!

119
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,333
Repeat what you just said!

120
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,583
What, that I'd like a burger?

121
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,666
Not that part!

122
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,041
Wait, you mean,

123
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,000
"Oh, and by the way,
I'm Manga Research Club Prez"?

124
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,458
Too far back!

125
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,708
[SHIGURE] "The girl in the photo
is Seisa Mikagura.

126
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,541
She's the granddaughter
of the principal"?

127
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,916
[gasps]

128
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,291
God, thank you!

[SHIGURE]
Um, Eruna?

Yep. She's the one.

131
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,708
[SHIGURE]
You can't marry a chick.

132
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:36,666
At least not right now.

133
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,333
Not that!

134
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,208
This is it.

135
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,250
I'm gonna apply for this school!

136
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,250
They're entrance exams,
that's all.

137
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,791
I can do it.

138
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,291
I mean, everything I needed to
do to get ready for today...

139
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,708
...I came really close
to actually doing,

140
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,625
so I bet I'll be just fine.

141
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,916
You are most kind for waiting.

143
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,583
Do you know how
delicate you look?

144
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,833
I don't suppose you'd mind

145
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,000
if I took your picture
real quick, would ya?

146
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:18,875
Huh?

147
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,500
Aw, nuts, I forgot my camera.

148
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,750
I'm so stupid.

149
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,125
Everything is in order
if you'd like

150
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,041
to follow me this way,
Miss Ichinomiya.

151
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,791
She knows my name!

152
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,333
Super pretty
and totally cute.

153
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,166
I think I'm gonna keep you
and call you Kurumi.

154
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,333
So what's the dealio?

155
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,125
Have you worked here
very long, Kurumi?

156
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,625
Are you seeing anyone right now?

157
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,291
Can I put myself in the running?

158
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,666
[laughs] Just kidding!

159
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,833
You will take the written
portion of the entrance exam

160
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:46,666
in this room.

161
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,583
Oh, right.

162
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,375
[ERUNA] Why do these
not seem hard?

163
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,541
[ERUNA]
She's sleeping?!

164
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,208
What's the catch?
Is this a trap?

165
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,125
Do I need to
hold it up to the light?

166
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,833
Maybe this has invisible ink.

167
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,000
I got it!

168
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,416
[yawns] What an idiot.

169
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,583
[ERUNA yelps, groans]

170
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,541
Next up will be the interview.

171
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,500
I can do this,

172
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,291
because everything I needed
to do to get ready for today...

173
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,500
[yells]

174
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,666
Go in as soon
as you're ready.

175
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,041
[ERUNA gasps]

176
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,041
Is anybody even here?

177
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,750
[VOICE]
Yeah. I don't know...

178
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:46,000
She doesn't look like she has
what it takes to me, ryui.

179
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,416
[VOICE] A direct descendant of
the main Ichinomiya family.

180
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,458
We even gave you special
treatment on the test,

181
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,958
which was also unfortunate.

182
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,791
[sighs] Wow. Poor thing.

183
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,625
Not often we get to see someone
as unlucky as you, ryui.

184
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,916
You should have a crap
luck cut off switch, ryui.

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,375
[screams]

186
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,708
Mine eyes, mine eyes!

187
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,250
Ah, the strange cat's eyes
are its weakness, I see.

188
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,791
Don't "I see" me, ryui!

189
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,458
To commit that kind
of ocular assault

190
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,375
upon such a cute and
lovable me can only mean

191
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,833
you are a cruel,
vicious child, ryui!

192
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,083
Right, a talking cat
with wings.

193
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,458
[gasps]
Is this another delusion?!

194
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,041
Crud!

195
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,250
Yeah, as if you
could dream me up.

196
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,250
Pinch yourself to check, though.

197
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,083
What's the point of pinching me?

198
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,458
I'm the one interviewing you,
so you know!

199
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,625
What?

200
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,041
Yep, I'm from
Mikagura Private Academy.

201
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,625
Think I'm gonna keep
you, too, and call you Bimii.

202
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,083
[BIMII] You don't get
to name me, ryui!

203
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,333
Also, what's up with ending
your sentences in "ryui"?

204
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,750
Don't you think it's
kind of like awkward?

205
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,250
Oh.

206
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,625
Well, then what about "fluffy"?

207
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,416
Would it be better if I said
"fluffy, fluffy"?

208
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,416
[ERUNA] No. I'm thinking
you should go for "ug."

209
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
That seems very unique, "ug."

210
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,708
No way, kid!

211
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,458
You chose that because
it's short for ugly,

212
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,625
didn't you, ug?

213
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,416
[ERUNA] I'm bored.
Is this the interview?

214
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,708
Oh. That's right, ryui.

215
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,250
We already have the
interview result in, ryui.

216
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,250
What?

217
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,583
But we haven't
done anything yet.

218
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:16,750
[gasps]

219
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,125
You mean...

220
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,000
...I failed?

221
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,750
[ERUNA]
No!

222
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,500
If this pointless conversation
was the interview,

223
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,833
then I've gotta be out.

224
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,000
And if the outs are
piling up with each inning,

225
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,750
then to continue
this baseball analogy,

226
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,333
it's the bottom of
the ninth with two outs

227
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,625
and the bases are loaded.

228
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,875
But I don't get baseball!

229
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,541
Which means I still got
a chance to turn things around!

230
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,583
[BIMII]
Well, your optimism confuses me.

231
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,666
What?

232
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,291
Does that mean
I didn't get in, then?

233
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:45,625
Don't worry, ryui.
You totally passed.

234
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:46,916
But how?

235
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,625
Well, first of all,
just being able to see me

236
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,083
means you're approved.

237
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,625
[ERUNA]
Okay. It's real.

238
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,750
[BIMII] I told you,
this isn't a dream, so stop--

239
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,458
If you're lying to me,
I'm so gonna make you pay!

240
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,833
[BIMII]
Why would I be lying?!

241
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,833
[ERUNA] I dunno, my delusions
are usually honest,

242
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,416
but they're not
usually cats, either!

243
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,083
[BIMII]
I'm not a delusion!

244
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,916
[ERUNA] Which is exactly
what a delusion would say!

245
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,625
[ERUNA]
What?

246
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,000
What?

247
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,125
Say what?

248
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,500
[ERUNA]
What is going on?!

249
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,666
This is a party to
welcome the new students.

250
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,750
One of the distinguishing
features of this academy

251
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,666
is that every student
in attendance is required

252
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,000
to be a member
of some sort of club.

253
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:55,166
Seriously? Those're clubs?

254
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,416
Might as well tell ya

255
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,666
what really makes
Mikagura such a special school.

256
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,083
We have to join clubs because we
all compete with each other

257
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,333
in these battles.

258
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,833
And why would you do that?

259
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,666
Because winning is
the only way a club

260
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,333
can earn a higher rank.

261
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,041
Since everyone wants the best
perks,

262
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,000
battles occur pretty regularly.

263
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,041
Basically, the clubs that win
more battles have a higher rank,

264
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,500
which means they get
preferential treatment.

265
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,875
Better and bigger dorm rooms,
he best food.

266
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,291
Stuff like that, ryui.

267
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,500
Oh!

268
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,833
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

269
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,125
Fun, it's like a party!
I'm in!

270
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,791
[STUDENTS chatting]

271
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,875
[ERUNA] Wow, there's
a lot of clubs here.

272
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,125
I didn't know people could
have this much culture.

273
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,541
[BIMII] Oh, yeah,
speaking of which,

274
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,583
I forgot to give this
to you, ryui.

275
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,208
[BIMII] It's a device
original to this school

276
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,208
that's given to
all the students, ryui.

277
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,375
Pretty cool, huh?

278
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,875
That thing collects
and keeps track

279
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,541
of all the points
you earn, ryui.

280
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,583
The more club battles you win,

281
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,166
the more points
you'll have, ryui.

282
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,750
You can even shop with it, ryui.

283
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,958
[ERUNA] So what you're saying
is my dreams have come true!

284
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,875
[BIMII] This is the girls' dorm,
where you will be sleeping

285
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,708
every day from now on, ryui.

286
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,083
[ERUNA]
It's all girls?!

287
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,125
[ERUNA] Yuriko,
I'm turning off the light.

288
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,708
[YURIKO]
Not just yet.

289
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,416
[ERUNA] I can take your
clothes off if you want.

290
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,166
[YURIKO] I would do it myself,
but I'm feeling so exhausted.

291
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,958
[breathing heavily]

292
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,541
[HIMI]
Hello there!

293
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,166
Hah! What's the deal, Teach?

294
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,916
Why'd you come
to the girls' dorm?

295
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,125
Don't tell me you're
one of those guys

296
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,625
who doesn't wanna
go home after work

297
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:57,708
because he's "lonely"?

298
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,458
[yells]

299
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,333
[ERUNA]
You're so tiny and adorable!

300
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,208
Do you want to live together,
like under the same roof?

301
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,208
C'mon! I'll feed you
carrots every day!

302
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,791
I'm not a rabbit,
and I hate carrots!

303
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,875
I'm not tiny, either!
Now put me back down!

304
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,291
[BIMII]
This is Himi Yasaka.

305
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,583
She's the president of the
calligraphy club, ryui.

306
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,583
Hello!

307
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,791
It's nice to meet you!

308
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,958
Wanna be my new best friend?

309
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,458
Ohmygah, what if
we became so close

310
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,208
people started getting
the wrong idea about us?

311
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,875
Doesn't that sound awesome?

312
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:24,958
So anyway,

313
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,250
Eruna's been assigned
to this dorm,

314
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,833
so I was just
showing her around.

315
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,500
Cool!

316
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,458
Well, in that case, I don't mind
taking you to your room!

317
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,000
[HIMI]
Ta-da, this is your room!

318
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,083
Uhh... You sure?

319
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,250
Because that looks like
a sleeping bag to me.

320
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,541
If you're not in a club,

321
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,958
then you don't get to have
your own room, ryui.

322
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,041
[gasps]

323
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,541
There's no need
to worry, though.

324
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,916
Sleeping bags are supposed
to be like really warm.

325
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,291
My brain
understands your words,

326
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,041
but my heart's
convinced I'll freeze.

327
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,125
Look, I can see another
not-a-room over there

328
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,875
that already has something
shivering to death inside!

329
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,333
[GIRL crying]
I want to go home!

330
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:03,208
Oh, mommy, I want to go home!

331
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,000
[HIMI]
Yoo-hoo, hello in there!

332
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,250
Hey!

333
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,750
I'm in the calligraphy club if
you wanna join.

334
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,333
You'll get to have a large,
private room

335
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,041
and delicious food if you do!

336
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,083
[GIRL gasps]

337
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,416
Um...

338
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,291
I'd like to, but I've just
started doing calligraphy,

339
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,125
so I didn't think you'd take me.

340
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,250
Are you guys okay
having beginners?

341
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,291
[ERUNA]
Excuse me!

342
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,708
I want to join the
calligraphy club, too!

343
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,583
Hmm... Let me think.

344
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,666
I know!

345
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,750
Write something down for me

346
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,833
so I can check out
what you can do!

347
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,250
[HIMI] It's not a big deal
if you're a beginner!

348
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,375
Calligraphy isn't about
technique, it's about soul!

349
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,833
[ERUNA yelling]

350
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:50,875
[HIMI]
Are you finished?

351
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,000
--[ERUNA] Yep!
--[GIRL] Yes!

352
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,333
Your strokes are really nice!

353
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,208
You can totally join the club!

354
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,916
What? Oh, really?
Thank you so much!

355
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,458
I decided to write my name!

356
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,583
Katai is a flower and a bag!

357
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:04,625
I won't let you down.

358
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,583
I'm gonna rock
at drawing letters!

359
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,916
Yay, calligraphy!

360
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,791
Himi! Don't forget
to look at mine!

361
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,583
I don't know what this is.

362
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,375
Nothing personal, but do you
have darkness inside your soul?

363
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,708
Maybe!

364
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:22,000
Sorry, Eruna, but this
is called a F. A. I. L.

365
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,458
[ERUNA]
A fail?!

366
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,666
[KATAI] If it helps at all,
the sleeping bag I was in

367
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,875
is nice and warmed up,

368
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,333
so please feel free
to go ahead and use it!

369
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,458
[ERUNA] As a matter of fact,
that doesn't help at all!

370
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,750
Come on, Katai, let's go!

371
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,250
Okay, Himi, I'm so
excited about life now!

372
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,000
[BIMII] It's probably time for
me to head to my room, ryui.

373
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,250
[ERUNA yells]

374
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,750
[BIMII] Aw, chill out.
I'll be back, ryui.

375
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,500
Wait! Don't leave me!

376
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,125
[stomach growling]

377
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:51,458
[ERUNA] I'm so hungry,
and I wanna take a shower.

378
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,625
But soon,

379
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,166
I feel like things are
gonna get more fun.

380
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,750
[KURUMI]
Good morning, class.

381
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,666
I'm your homeroom teacher,
Kurumi Narumi.

382
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,208
I don't want to be called Miss
Narumi because that's weird,

383
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,291
so go with Miss Kurumi.

384
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,666
No way! Kurumi?

385
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,541
Remember me? I totally
guessed your name right!

386
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,750
Why don't we start
with introducing yourselves.

387
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:21,583
First up, student number one,
Eruna Ichinomiya.

388
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,750
Here! Uh... Aqui?

389
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,333
I wrote that for you
to read in class, ryui.

390
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,291
Uh, you're welcome by the way.

391
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,791
[ERUNA]
Thank you, Bimii!

392
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,458
Ahem!

393
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,333
I'm Eruna Ichinomiya,
a trick star surprise

394
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,416
from the far outside.

395
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,958
Here to keep battles fresh.

396
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,375
At least that's my goal!

397
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,416
I'm not just number one
on the attendance sheet, either.

398
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,083
So if you want the chance to
have a sip of sweet liqueur,

399
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,875
then invite me
to join your club.

400
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,458
In your face!

401
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:51,791
[ERUNA]
Yay me?

402
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,166
[ERUNA]
What?! Shoot me now.

403
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,375
This can't be all I get
to eat for lunch!

404
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,833
Yep, if you don't
belong to a club,

405
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,500
this is your meal, ryui.

406
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,125
Huh?

407
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,000
[BIMII]
Whoops, forgot to tell you

408
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,166
that if you're not in a club,

409
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,500
you only get five minutes
in there, ryui.

410
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,916
But it's better for water
conservation, ryui.

411
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,625
[ERUNA]
I don't care about conservation!

412
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,916
It's not better for me!

413
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,083
Hello!

414
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,125
Teenage girl with raging
hormones in here!

415
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,708
[BIMII] You should just join any
club for the time being, Eruna.

416
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,083
[ERUNA groans]

417
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,791
Okay, fine.
What club is this girl in?

418
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,333
Seisa Mikagura's in
the going-home club.

419
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,666
That's real?
A going-home club?

420
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,666
Yes, it's very real,
gets special treatment,

421
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,125
and hasn't accepted new members
for a while now, ryui.

422
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,291
[BIMII] As a matter of fact,
Seisa just stays in her mansion

423
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,500
and hardly ever
even comes to school.

424
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,666
[STUDENTS chattering]

425
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,291
[stomach growling]

426
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,208
PS, I'm starving.

427
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,833
[BIMII] Which is why
you need to join a club.

428
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:59,041
If there's one you like, you can
sign up for a trial period.

429
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,166
[BOY yelling]

430
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,291
[BOY] I'm so sorry!
I didn't mean to! I'm sorry!

431
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,583
Dude, why are
you cowering there

432
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,375
like you're about
to start crying?

433
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,291
Knock it off or everyone's gonna
think I'm bullying you.

434
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,666
[ASUHI] Oh. I'm sorry.

435
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,541
That's not what
I'm trying to do.

436
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,083
That guy is Kuzuryu
from the art club.

437
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,125
And the one on the ground
is Asuhi Imizu

438
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,041
from the astronomy club.

439
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,666
Jeez, thanks a lot.

440
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,125
Now the whole school will be
talking about this.

441
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,541
Look, man, you need to stop
acting like a noob.

442
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh. I, um...

443
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,208
I didn't mean to make a scene,

444
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,458
and I'm really sorry
for bumping into you.

445
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,583
[SEISA] Why don't we
leave it at that, guys?

446
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,333
[SEISA] Kuzuryu,
this isn't the kind of thing

447
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,208
to get that upset about, is it?

448
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,416
Me upset?

449
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,416
Whatever. We're just
having a conversation.

450
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,500
Are you all right?

451
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,666
I'm good!

452
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,166
I can't thank you enough!
You saved me!

453
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,250
I realize he has a
tendency to scare people

454
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,458
because of how he looks,

455
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,000
but he's misunderstood,
that's all.

456
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,416
I hope you won't
hold that against him.

457
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:17,791
[breathing heavily]

458
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,125
Let me guess...

459
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,291
She's the one you decided
to go after this time?

460
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,458
Was that to me?

461
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,333
Did the goddess just say
real words to me?

462
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,458
I still can't say
for sure, ryui.

463
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,416
I'm thinking about it, yes.

464
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,291
But if so, she might
have possibilities

465
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,916
of a different vector
from you, ryui.

466
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,041
I see.

467
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,458
Welcome.

468
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,583
If you haven't decided on which
club you wanted to join yet,

469
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,375
think you might join
the going-home club

470
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,791
for a trial period?

471
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:50,000
Of course, that's only if you
feel so inclined.

472
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,541
I'm inclined!
I feel so inclined.

473
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,458
Yeah, I'm like totally
inclined right now.

474
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,375
In fact, I was born inclined!

475
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,291
I feel so inclined
with my body and soul!

476
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,416
Then it's decided.

477
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,125
[STUDENTS gasp, whisper]

478
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,000
[SEISA]
Oh, yes.

479
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,875
It completely slipped my mind.

480
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,250
There's a small
club battle next week.

481
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,041
Unfortunately, I've been
planning on being indisposed

482
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,708
that particular day.

483
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,625
If you could enter as
the going-home club rep,

484
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,166
that'd be great.

485
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,375
[ERUNA] My goddess invited me
to join the going-home club.

486
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,041
I don't think it's my
imagination, either.

487
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,583
Oh, please be
real life this time!

488
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,041
Booyah!

489
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,375
[ERUNA] This feels like
the start of a story!

490
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,250
[ERUNA]
And it's gonna be awesome!

491
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,541
[SHIGURE] And now,
my lovey-dovey school life

492
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,375
with Eruna finally begins!

493
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:22,833
Our love can
overcome everything,

494
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:24,541
for it is pure and true!

495
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,125
That's why we're
gonna get married!

496
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:29,000
Will the kids at school give us
their blessing?! They better!

497
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,750
Find out next time on
"Romantic Honeymoon"!

498
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,958
[ERUNA] Why're you making up
a fake preview, Shigure?

499
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,333
[SHIGURE]
What? It's not fake!

500
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:36,750
[ERUNA]
Uh-huh!

501
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,625
Next time it's about the
gorgeous and hella mysterious

502
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:39,833
Seisa Mikagura,

503
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:42,000
aka the principal's
beloved granddaughter.

504
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:44,250
I'm assuming she loves
her because, well whatever.

505
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,250
Seisa leads me into
the forbidden girls' dorm

506
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,666
so we can have forbidden
dorm experiences,

507
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,000
like college, but not!

508
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:52,875
Next time, "Secret Flower
Garden Escalation!"

509
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,041
[BIMII] Eruna, you're making
that preview up too, ryui!

510
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,291
[ERUNA]
Uh, don't be weird, Bimii.

511
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,708
[BIMII]
You don't be weird, ryui!

512
00:24:57,791 --> 00:25:00,166
Can we do the preview
for real, already? Gah!

513
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,541
Eruna's ability
finally awakens, ryui!

514
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:05,250
Next time,
"After-School Stride."
