Yo, yo, Eruna.

to rap at me, please?

Well, you're
very welcome, Eruna.

The go word will be "go," okay?

[HIMI] I wanna give
the "go," though, okay?

30
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,791
Should we use something else

accidentally gave the "go"?

[MINATOGAWA]
I want to say it, as well.

I've never been entrusted
with "go" before,

34
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,166
so I think it would be fun.

If you're feeling worried
about Usamaru, don't be.

If Tonkyun wins
his next two matches,

it's not that bad for Usamaru.

I'm glad you had a good time.

but she said it was
past her bedtime,

95

so she couldn't make it.

96

This is why I
hate these club battles.

[ERUNA]
Oh.

98
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,916
[SHIGURE] Kuzuryu asked
who else was coming,

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,500
which made me hopeful,

100
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,291
but then he said he was afraid
he'd ruin the mood if he showed.

101
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,250
Oh come on,
like Enoyan needs to worry

102
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,791
about ruining the mood.

103
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,708
He should have realized that
the mood would already be ruined

104
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:13,791
with you being here.

106
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,083
It's as if you don't even care
when you're breaking my heart!

107

Oh, hey.

108
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,416

when you were a first year,

109

00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,166
Don't tell me you won.

111
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,166
[SHIGURE]
No, I didn't win.

112
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,375
Actually, I wasn't a student
at this academy yet

113
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,708
when I was a freshman.

114
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,125
Where'd you go?

115
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,083
[SHIGURE] Mikagura has
a sister school of sorts

116
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,333
that acts as our rival.

117
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,916
I attended that
academy for a year

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,833
before transferring
over as a sophomore.

119
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,500
Oh, Kuzuryu went there
his first year, too.

120
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,125
[SHIGURE]
It's pretty far west of us.

121
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:50,041
You know how we only have
cultural clubs at Mikagura?

122
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,041
Well, they're basically
the complete opposite

123
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,333
in that respect.

124
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,333
They battle and
have matches like we do,

125
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,583
but they only have sports clubs.

126
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,541
I was practically obsessed
with kendo back then,

127
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,291
so I enrolled ready
to throw myself into it.

128
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,583
But in the end,
I had a hard time dealing

129
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,833
with how everything
was win-or-lose there.

130
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,541
[SHIGURE]
That's where I met Kuzuryu.

131
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,291
Seemed like a
cool enough guy to me.

132
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,875
[SHIGURE] Let me get this
straight. You're a ringer,

133
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,625
so you're not technically
a member of judo club?

134
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,875
[KUZURYU] Yep.
I've got basketball tomorrow

135
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,750
and track and field
the next day.

136
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,375
You're good at
everything, then, right?

137
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,708
Why not pick just
one club and own it?

138
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,083
I was gonna go with kendo,

139
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,666
but looks like
that wouldn't work out.

140
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,958
You're there,
and your Hero Time...

141
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,041
No one can beat you.

142
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,791
[BOTH laughing]

143
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,416
[SHIGURE] Kuzuryu wasn't
a member of a single club.

144
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,000
He helped out a lot
of different clubs

145
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,458
acting as what's
called a ringer.

146
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,708
However, as his
reputations spread,

147
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,291
kids started getting
jealous and bitter.

148
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,750
They resented him.

149
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:57,833
And then...

150
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,500
One day,
he accidentally overheard

151
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,458
one of his closest friends
talking about him

152
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,125
behind his back.

153
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:07,125
Let's just say what was said
didn't sit well with him.

154
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,583
[SHIGURE] After that,
he felt like he couldn't trust

155
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,500
the people around him anymore.

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,875
[SHIGURE]
Kuzuryu, what's wrong?

157
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,333
[KUZURYU] Don't act
like you care, Hero Time.

158
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,166
You're just like everyone else.

159
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,666
You don't really like me.

160
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,791
And you don't want
me here either, do you?

161
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,375
[SHIGURE]
What?

162
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,166
[SHIGURE] That was the last time
I saw him at that school.

163
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,750
He transferred out.

164
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,875
Poor Enoyan...

165
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,458
Oh, he suffered so much.

166
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,416
[blows nose loudly]

167
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,000
That was gross.

168
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,458
Anyway, it turned out I couldn't
adjust to their style either,

169
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,500
so immediately after
I won their rookie battle,

170
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,875
I transferred here
to Mikagura Academy.

171
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,541
[SHIGURE]
It kinda sucks, though.

172
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,833
I mean, we're nice to
each other and everything,

173
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,625
but we've never been as
close as we were back then.

174
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,708
Still, at least neither one
of us is at that awful school.

175
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,458
You guys both
did the right thing!

176
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,708
Well of course you came
to Mikagura Academy!

177
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,000
That was the smartest
move you could've made!

178
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,625
In case you missed it,

179
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:18,000
let me reiterate that I won
the rookie battle that year.

180
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,041
I almost lost a bunch of times.

181
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,541
Seriously, I barely
squeaked out the win.

182
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:23,958
but I do wonder
what would've happened

183
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,875
if Kuzuryu had
participated, too.

184
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,458
[ERUNA] I don't understand
why if you were in

185
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,750
the kendo club before,

186
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,791
you decided to go with
the manga research club

187
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:31,916
once you got here.

188
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,375
And why did Enoyan
choose the art club?

189
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,666
[SHIGURE] To be honest,
that is a pretty long story.

190
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,958
And we should save it
for another time.

191
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,083
[ERUNA]
Tension max... let's go!

192
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,916
[DEVICE]
Winner. Eruna Ichinomiya.

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,750
[ERUNA]
Yeah! Tension max, go!

194
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,708
[DEVICE]
Winner. Eruna Ichinomiya.

195
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,083
[ERUNA]
This is awesome!

196
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,041
The world's my freakin' mollusk!

197
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,208
[BIMII]
Oyster.

198
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,583
You know you'll be
in the quarterfinals

199
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,291
if you win
your next battle!

200
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:04,333
Uh...

201
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,458
[pounding on door]

202
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,041
[ERUNA]
Enoyan!

203
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,916
Your favorite and most adorable
underclassman has come to visit!

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,416
Hey!

205
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,666
You've been
completely surrounded!

206
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,791
Imagine how much you're
making your mother cry.

207
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,916
You should
surrender immediately!

208
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:22,916
[clears throat]

209
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,125
Milk!

210
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,833
I got some nice, cool,
yummy milk for you!

211
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,333
Okay, where's the milk?

212
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,250
It's, uh, at the store.

213
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,708
I'll go get some right now.
You love me!

214
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,833
[KUZURYU]
It's fine.

215
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,916
You don't have to
go buy anything.

216
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,583
[ERUNA gasps, laughs]

217
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,791
[ERUNA]
Wow!

218
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,541
So this is like your
fortress of solitude?

219
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,625
[KUZURYU] You don't have
to make it sound dramatic.

220
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:48,916
Heads up.

221
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,041
[ERUNA]
Cool! I can drink this!

222
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,833
Did you get it just for me?

223
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,291
No, stop being be ridiculous.

224
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,583
[ERUNA]
Groovy!

225
00:10:56,666 --> 00:11:00,291
There are so many
certificates and trophies!

226
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,583
[ERUNA]
"Innocence"?

227
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:05,125
How cool, this says
it's the Grand Prize!

228
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,458
That's amazing!

229
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,708
[KUZURYU]
It doesn't mean anything.

230
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,666
[ERUNA]
What? Yes it does!

231
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,916
And I bet the person
named Innocence agrees.

232
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,208
That's not a name, stupid.

233
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,750
It's the title
of a damn painting!

234
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,583
Okay, well I wanna see it, then!

235
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,750
Where is this Innocence?

236
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,083
[KUZURYU]
Who knows?

237
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,125
[ERUNA] Why won't you
show it to me?

238
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:34,875
[KUZURYU]
Just kidding.

239
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,958
Stop looking at that junk.

240
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,333
[ERUNA]
Junk?

241
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,125
The guy who came up
with a title like "Innocence"

242
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:43,291
without a shred of
irony or embarrassment?

243
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,458
Yeah, well that kid
isn't here anymore.

244
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,416
[ERUNA]
Oh! By Kyoma Kuzuryu!

245
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,000
[KUZURYU]
What did you want?

246
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,166
[ERUNA]
That's rude.

247
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,625
Why would you assume
I would come see you

248
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,666
because I wanted something?

249
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,708
Funny story...

250
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,166
I just decided
I wanted something.

251
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,041
I have a favor to ask!

252
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,083
[KUZURYU]
I refuse.

253
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,833
[ERUNA] I didn't say
what it is yet!

254
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,125
[ERUNA]
Come on, Enoyan.

255
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,000
Will you draw me, please?

256
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,666
I want you to
draw me how you see me!

257
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,333
And if you want me to...
I'll do it.

258
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,875
As long as it's
for the art, of course.

259
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,583
I don't mind taking
it all off for this!

260
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,416
Turn me down if you want,

261
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,166
but you know I'll
just come back tomorrow.

262
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,166
Well that's fine with me.

263
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,166
I'll just turn
you down tomorrow.

264
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,500
[ERUNA]
Crap, it's late!

265
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,333
Hey, you should come
watch my next match!

266
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,750
It'll be fun.
You can cheer for me!

267
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,666
[KUZURYU]
Why should I?

268
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,000
Isn't it obvious?

269
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,166
Because I asked you to!

270
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,583
[KUZURYU]
Yeah, we'll see.

271
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,125
Sounds like a promise to me!

272
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,791
What was that about?

273
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,500
I have no idea what
she's thinking, as usual.

274
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,333
[USAMARU]
Hurry, Eruna! Over here!

275
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,791
[ERUNA]
I'm running!

276
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,000
[USAMARU] Of course she's
as high as she can get.

277
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,416
Big surprise.

278
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,458
[STUDENTS laughing]

279
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,708
Alrighty, you got any idea
why he's riding a panda?

280
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,625
You know, one would've figured
he'd have gone with a pig.

281
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,625
[SAGARA] Is my opponent today
another supporting character

282
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:39,916
from the drama club?

283
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,583
The rabbit loses,
so they send in a pig?

284
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,958
Nothing like a little
smoked pork, am I right?

285
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,000
[laughs]

286
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,625
[TONKYUN] It's true I'm
a supporting character

287
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,250
from the drama club.

288
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,000
However, even us lowly
supporting characters

289
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,291
have very different
ways of fighting.

290
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,750
[DEVICE]
Begin the match.

291
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,125
[SAGARA] I'll make mincemeat
out of you in no time.

292
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,125
Let's do this.

293
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah. Molto Accento!

294
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:09,000
[loud cacophony]

295
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh, I get it now!

296
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,625
She can't increase the gravity
of a wide space all at once.

297
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,125
He just has to
approach her like that

298
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,041
without her
locking on to him.

299
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,083
[SAGARA] You know you're
third-rate, right?

300
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,958
I bet you wish you were
as smart as a pig, huh?

301
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,500
If you were, you might not have
assumed a top performer like me

302
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,125
wouldn't have seen
through your lame plan.

303
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,500
[TONKYUN] All you are is talk,
you know that?

304
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,750
[TONKYUN] If you think you
can beat me, go ahead and try.

305
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,625
What, are you scared
of a moving pig?

306
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,375
You scared of me?

307
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,958
[yelling]

308
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,666
[SAGARA]
You swine!

309
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,666
How dare you think you can
talk to your better like that!

310
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,625
One little piggy!

311
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,041
Two little piggies!

312
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,125
You better watch out or
all the piggies are gonna die!

313
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,791
Last little piggy's turn!

314
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,625

Top-Performer, huh?

316
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,500
You don't really seem
that special to me.

317
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,750
[SAGARA]
So what?

318
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,166
Think about it.

319
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,666
How are you going to break
my crystals in that state?

320
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,291
All you can really do is
wait until time runs out.

321
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,083
[TONKYUN] Seems like you would
be the one more concerned

322
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,375
with how much time is left.

323
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,541
[TONKYUN]
The end is upon us.

324
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,708
[TONKYUN] Unfortunately, your
performance has come to an end.

325
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,916
You jerk! You were
planning this from the start.

326
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,166
I discovered your handicap

327
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,250
while watching your
match with Usamaru.

328
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,125
Your ability is impressive.

329
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,458
But it cannot be
used continuously.

330
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,583
After you perform
for a certain amount of time,

331
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,291
you appear to require a rest.

332
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,958
And then there's a lag time

333
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:59,458
before you can activate your
ability again, isn't there?

334
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,291
In yesterday's match,
after your performance ended,

335
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,875
you just stood for a while
on top of the pipe organ.

336
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,125
Once your ability has stopped

337
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,166
and you can't float
in the air anymore,

338
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,666
all you can do is
hide safely out of reach.

339
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,708
In general, the right move.

340
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,458
But if you had fought
fair and square,

341
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:20,083
there's no way you'd've
been able to beat Usamaru.

342
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,666
Shut up, you disgusting pig!

I'm fighting for
something important,

the strength I need to win.

I did say that the rookie battle
would help promote your club,

but that's not
what I meant, ryui.

Besides, your descriptions of
the types of members you want

How ironic.

The bullet is obviously slower

471
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:31,041
[KUZURYU] I'll leave that
to your imagination.

472
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:33,291
[ERUNA] Okay give me a minute.
I'm going to visualize it.

473
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,750
Okay, you're milking...

474
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,833
Whoa, you're a
furious milker, man!

475
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:40,375
Hello, underhanded, too?!
I did not see that coming.

476
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:43,708
Must be those painter hands that
make you so talented with teats!

477
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:44,875
[giggles]

478
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,833
[KUZURYU]
Of course your mind went there.

479
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:47,666
[ERUNA]
Oh!

480
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,083
[KUZURYU]
What's wrong?

481
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,500
[ERUNA] Don't look, but
Seisa is standing next to us!

482
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:52,541
[KUZURYU] Maybe she wants
to do a preview, too.

483
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,625
[SEISA] No I don't.
Not especially, at least.

484
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,708
[ERUNA] Yay, a preview
together with Seisa!

485
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:58,791
It can be a trailer
for our happy wedding!

486
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,166
Like an opening prelude. 

487
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,375
[SEISA]
You don't make sense.

488
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,250
[ERUNA] Then do a preview
you understand!

489
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,833
Please show me how it's done!

490
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:06,541
Teach me something, senpai!

491
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:08,125
[SEISA]
If you insist... 

492
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:12,833
Next time on this show,
"Izayoi Seeing."

493
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:15,875
Something wonderful might happen
beneath the star-filled sky.

494
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:17,291
[ERUNA]
That's how you say it?!

495
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:19,791
I don't think I've ever
said Izayoi out loud before!

496
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:22,208
See, I did learn something!
Thanks, Seisa!

497
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:23,500
[SEISA]
You're welcome...?
