Is it already time?

00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,833
I guess we should stop here
for today, then.

7
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,833
We've got the
club battle tomorrow.

8
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:01,958
And a tough one at that,

9
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,166
considering we're
fighting each other.

10

You realize
I won't hold back.

You better not.

12
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,125
Plus, fair fights
are more fun anyway.

13

I couldn't be more excited.

[SHIGURE]
What a great season!

18
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,208
But this year's
rookie battle is over!

19
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,166
And the winner has been decided!

[SHIGURE]
So now, the hero interview

22
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,708
you've been waiting for
will be conducted by moi!

23
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,500
The manga research club rep,
Shigure Ninomiya!

24

[GIRL 7A]
We love you, Ninomiya!

25
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,833
[GIRL 7B] Did you see?
He took off his glasses!

26
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,125
Your winner, Otone Fujishiro.

27
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,833
Believe it or not,
this talented fighter

28
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,416
isn't actually a
member of any club!

29
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,416
If Miss Fujishiro's
still not part of a club,

30
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,458
then I'm willing to bet
she's in the same situation

31
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,750
that you're in, ryui.

32
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,333
I know. Makes me wonder.

33
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:48,041
It's weird she doesn't look
happy even though she won.

34
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,708
And now, it's time
for the hero interview!

35
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,083
[microphone feedback]

36
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,375
You think Fuji's a hero?

37
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,583
Don't know why.

38
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,625
That was really more
like a standard warm-up.

39
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,625
Au revoir, the interview's over.

40
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,791
[SHIGURE]
Hey! Where are you going?

41
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:21,125
You can't leave in
the middle of my interview!

42
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,625
Sorry about that, folks.

43
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,458
Now...

44
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,541
What a twerp.

45
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,166
I didn't realize
he was that blind

46
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,458
without his glasses on, ryui.

47
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,500
[SHIGURE] Let's try
this again, shall we?

48
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,333
This year's
hero interview, take two.

49
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,916
First, tell us how you're
feeling in this moment.

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,291
Conflicted, maybe.

51
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,625
It's not easy to narrow down
my emotions to one word.

52
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,708
Whoopsie!

53
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,250
I'm accidentally
interviewing the wrong person!

54
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,625
Otone, where did you go?

55
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,083
I've heard of
the emotional biting

56
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,458
on a handkerchief
thing before,

57
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,500
but I never thought
it would look so icky.

I'm so glad you're here!

61
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,625
How did he know?
He can't see me!

62
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,166
[BIMII] Fairly certain
he sniffed you out, ryui.

Hey, wait. Shigure?

64
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,041
Well, since we've
got some extra time,

65
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,083
here's a surprise interview!

66
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,291
This student left a great
impression at the rookie battle

67
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,625
and made it all the way
to the quarterfinals!

68
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,166
But that's not all!

69
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,916
She's also planning to have
brilliant and adorable babies

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,250
with me in the future!

71

[giggling]

74
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,500
I wonder what kind
of girl that Otone is.

75
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,208
I'd really like to talk to her.

76
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,000
What do you
wanna talk about, ryui?

77
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,958
Oh, nothing in particular.

78
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,250
I'm just kinda curious
what she's all about.

79
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,958
[crying]

80
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,541
[BIMII]
From what I understand,

81
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,916
Minatogawa takes care of most of
the flowerbeds over there, ryui.

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,958
[crying]

83
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,041
It's her! Ohmigah, look!

84
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,166
She's sitting in the most
adorable ladylike position

85
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,666
I've ever seen!
I can't handle the cute!

86
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,750
I have to go talk to her
before I explode!

87
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,750
Here goes nothing.
Move it or lose it, girl!

88
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,291
[BIMII]
Hold up!

89
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,833
It sounds like she's muttering
something to herself, ryui.

90
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,083
[OTONE]
I went and did it again.

91
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,916
C'mon, don't
worry about it, Otone!

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You can sit in that position
anytime and anywhere.

93
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,083
Do what you want!

94
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,125
Oh great, I've lost you,
haven't I, ryui?

95
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,625
I didn't even mean
what I said this time.

96
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,208
À quoi bon. I'm lost.

97
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,875
It's like there's a devil
living in my head

98
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,375
that makes me a lunatic.

99
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,458
Bimii! Did you hear her?

100
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,708
She speaks in fancy lingo,

101
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,333
like from another country
and stuff.

102
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,791
Do you think she's
a world traveler, maybe?

103
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:39,791
Oh, I bet she is!

104
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,666
I can't take this.
It's so cool!

105
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,625
I wish I could figure out

106
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,708
how to stop being
so dang shy!

107
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,000
I can't help it, though.

108
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,875
When I get nervous,
my mind blanks out on me.

109
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,208
Then, mean hateful words
just jump out of my mouth

110
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,208
like little sabotaging bastards!

111
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,958
[sobs loudly]

112
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,208
Otone, you don't have
to worry about that crapola

113
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,500
ever again!

114
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,666
I will hold you tight
and keep you safe!

115
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,833
I'll be your savior.

116
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:01,583
Demon!

117
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,791
Oh no!

118
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,375
Mama told Fuji over
and over about the beast

119
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,333
that would prey on pretty girls
when they were alone,

120
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,125
but stupid Fuji
didn't believe her!

121
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,375
Wait, that means Fujishiro
must have been pretty.

122
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,125
And that's why you showed up!

123
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:16,500
Mama, did you see this?
Fujishiro is pretty!

124
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,041
[BIMII] It's not just that
she's not a member of a club.

125
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:22,041
This chick appears to be
just as crazy as you are, ryui.

126
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,541
[OTONE]
Huh?

127
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,791
Fuji swears that she's seen
you around somewhere before.

128
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,125
Hey, you're that
girl with panache

129
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,041
who impressed us until
the quarterfinal melee'

130
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,500
but then screwed
the pooch and lost

131
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,000
to what's-her-name from the
broadcasting club, right?

132
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,875
My name's Eruna Ichinomiya!

133
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,125
I'll stay right by your side

134
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,416
until you can
stop being so timid!

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,041
Fuji, shy?
what are you talking about?

136
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,333
And she is not even
sure what timid means!

137
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,416
Is it just me, or did nothing
about what she just said

138
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,791
make any sense, ryui?

139
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,333
Ah! Mr. Bimii!

140
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,625
Thank you so much for
your hard work at school!

141
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:52,875
And just so you know,

142
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,625
Fujishiro is an A+
super-duper star student!

143
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,541
Mr. Bimii should write
that down in the student record.

144
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,416
Write that Fujishiro
is a star student.

145
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,791
Write it down.

146
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,708
You need to understand
that whispering in my ear

147
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,916
won't brainwash me
into doing anything, ryui.

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,791
You know, I don't
think Bimii has the power

149
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,750
to write in any student records.

150
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,083
What?
Well, this is a waste of time.

151
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,250
[BIMII shrieks]

152
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,041
So, basically even
though you're a teacher,

153
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,208
you can still be pretty
low on the totem pole.

154
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,291
That must be a really
embarrassing dynamic for you.

155
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,041
Must be hard being so ugly, too.

156
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:26,166
Why did she get so
mean all of a sudden, ryui?

157
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,708
Is it Dark Otone,
or Light Otone?

158
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:29,791
I can't choose!

159
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,333
I just love both
of them so dang much!

00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,791
This rudeness of yours
is not appreciated!

161
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,333
Fujishiro is always
light, obviously.

162
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,208
[ERUNA]
Shameless!

163
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,791
Man, that girl is truly,
truly outrageous.

164
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:44,875
I dig it!

165
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,583
[ERUNA]
What do you say?

166
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,916
You know you do.

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,208
You wanna sit in that
ladylike position, right?

168
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,833
[SEISA]
Is it like this?

169
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,083
Yes, yes it is!

170
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,500
That looks perfect!

171
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,250
It's the foolproof sitting
position with no openings

172
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,541
no matter what angle
you're looking from!

173
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,750
You're so talented, Seisa!

174
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,000
That might be the most
modest way of sitting,

175
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:08,208
but it still evokes
unexpected beauty.

176
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,458
One that lies
in our anticipation.

177
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,333
We see the perfection
yet nonetheless wait

178
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,708
for accidental openings
to present themselves to us.

179
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,791
[ERUNA]
Whoa!

180
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,041
A surprise ladylike position
from Miss Kurumi!

181
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,625
Wow!

182
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,958
On top of that is a waft of a
slightly dangerous fragrance,

183
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,250
skirting the edges of foul play,

184
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,208
and the collaboration
with Seisa's modesty

185
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,083
also brings an
exquisite synergy!

186
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,041
[ERUNA grunts]

187
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,208
[KURUMI] You can imagine
whatever you want,

188
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,875
but I'd really
rather you not drag me

189
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,625
into your bizarre delusions.

190
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,083
Yes, ma'am.

191
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,541
So this special girl who has

192
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,666
the oh-so-wonderful
ladylike sitting position

193
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,333
is Otone Fujishiro,
winner of the rookie battle?

194
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,375
Yep!

195
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,625
She's just really talented,
I guess.

196
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,625
Oh, and like me,

197
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:49,875
she's not a member
of any club yet,

198
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,500
but not like me, she's a
complete nutty nutball.

199
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,666
From what I've heard,

200
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,791
Asuhi's loss to her
was pretty terrible.

201
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,541
Yeah, but in his
interview after Otone left,

202
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,458
Asuhi seemed kinda
positive about it.

203
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:04,833
[ASUHI] The winner, Otone
Fujishiro, was extremely strong.

204
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,166
I honestly don't even
compare to her right now.

205
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,833
But after this great
learning experience,

206
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,375
I think I'm going to try to
fight Miss Fujishiro again

207
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,916
in the next club battle.

208
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,958
I'd like to fight her
as much as possible.

209
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,125
Hopefully, I'll win
more matches than I lose.

210
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,208
Then...

211
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,333
I can prove to you
that I'm a winner!

212
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,916
Asuhi actually inspired me!

213
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm gonna work hard
making my new club,

214
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,166
and next time,
I'll pass quarterfinals!

215
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,500
I'll win the whole
shebang and own that stage!

216
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,916
[ERUNA]
Seisa, help!

217
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,291
I need to know what kind of club
you think I should make!

218
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,041
I thought you wanted
something along the lines of

219
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,666
"The Surrounding
Eruna Ichinomiya

220
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,375
with Fawning
Pretty Girls Club."

221
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,291
I say go for it.

222
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,333
What about "The
Surrounding Eruna Ichinomiya

223
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,541
with Kicking Girls Who Like to
Kick Eruna Ichinomiya Club"?

224
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,833
I know I'd join it.

225
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,291
[ERUNA gasps]
I didn't think about that one!

226
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,416
But I'm not opposed to it.

227
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,833
You should be.

228
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,750
I dunno, why don't you
just call it the "Idiot Club"

229
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,083
and call it a day?

230
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,833
Well I'm not
opposed to that, either!

231
00:10:58,916 --> 00:10:59,791
It doesn't matter, though.

232
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:00,916
The problem I have right now

233
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,375
is getting the
three people I need

234
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,083
to officially
form a club together.

235
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,625
But Seisa, once I
finally do form my club,

236
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,458
will you please fight me
again as representative

237
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,250
of the going-home club?

238
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,291
Well, you realize
I won't hold back.

239
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,166
Duh!

240
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,166
Fair fights are more fun anyway!

241
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,458
I couldn't be more excited!

00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,791
How 'bout you?

00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,000
Is everything all right?

Yes. Don't worry. I'm fine.

[TONKYUN]
Is something wrong?

249
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,791
Early predictions pegged Asuhi
as a first-magnitude star,

250
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,416
but he was actually
a six-magnitude

251
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,583
and didn't shine much.

252
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:09,583
So not nice!

253
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,333
Why would anyone
write that crap?

No, it's okay.

255
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,916
They're just telling the truth:
I wasn't strong enough.

256
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It turned out I couldn't live up
to everybody's expectations.

257
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,166
I let them all down.

258
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,250
You are much
too hard on yourself.

259
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,833
I watched the match,
and I have to be honest, mister.

260
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,625
You seemed a lot stronger than
when you practiced with Yuto.

261
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,083
She's right, and remember
we all know you rock!

Wow. That's really
nice of you to say.

And you know,

I guess even the
dimmest star in the sky

266
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,541
is sending light out somewhere.

267
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,958
I'm not too happy
that my faint light

268
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,708
was made fun of publicly.

269
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,708
It's not just embarrassing--
It makes me sad.

270
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,500
But I'll get over it.

271

A party so we can
cheer up Asuhi?

That's right!

Yuto's great at coming up
with party ideas.

274

Well... It's just...

275
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,833
No one should ever feel that bad
about coming in second place.

what your take on it was.

I say why not?
Let's do it!

278

If you want my two cents,

279
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,666
you probably oughta
steer away from calling it

a "cheer up party,"yui.

281
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,083
We should shoot for something
more fun than "cheer up."

Good call, Kumano!

If that's the
direction we're going,

286
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,625
I think we should
have it in Yuto's room.

287
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,416
What?
Why is it always my room?

Hey, who all
should we invite?

289
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,500
Himi, Katai, Minatogawa
will all show up,

Oh! Let's invite Otone, too!

but Light Otone

be a nice addition.

00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,500
and grab an umbilical cord!

318
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,375
I don't think that's
what you meant, ryui.

319
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,583
[ERUNA]
Sounds perfect to me!

320
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:19,666
[BIMII]
No, ma'am!

321
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,500
We don't want to
freak Asuhi out, ryui!

322
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,875
[MINATOGAWA] I'll go if you
want, but you can't have him.

323
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,916
[ERUNA]
Uh good, I don't want him.

324
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,291
I don't know.

325
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,708
I'm afraid if I show,
I'd end up ruining the mood.

326
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,416
Unless you're okay with it
being ruined a little bit.

327
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,625
Don't worry!

328
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,500
If that happens,
I'll just make Bimii fix it!

329
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,583
But how?

330
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,041
And why me? Ryui.

331
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,166
Why would Fujishiro
want to go to some lame party?

332
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,625
It's weird to even ask her.

333
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,583
Fujishiro doesn't
get this idea at all.

334
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,541
You'd have so much fun,
Light Otone!

335
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,583
[OTONE]
Fuji doubts that.

336
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,666
Or more like
you don't doubt that!

337
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,500
Right?

338
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,625
A party?

339
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,958
Okay, I'll at least
think about it.

340
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,000
After you think about it,
you should go!

341
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,666
Oh poo.
This is getting heavy.

342
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,500
Now what kind of theme
do we think it should be?

343
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,958
Themes are cool!
Normal parties are boring!

344
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,000
[TONKYUN] Since Asuhi
likes astronomy so much,

345
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,916
maybe we should go
with "under the stars."

346
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,708
The roof at night
would be cool, roar!

347
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,208
Yeah! That's a brilliant idea!

348
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,250
Okay, then I say
the location of the party

349
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,375
should be changed
from my room to the roof.

350
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,458
[USAMARU] Any thoughts
on what we should tell Asuhi?

351
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,375
Well, we definitely want
it to be a surprise, so...

352
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,875
Maybe we give him this invite

353
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,833
without telling him
what it's for.

354
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,458
I'm exhausted, ryui.

355
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,125
Oh, hey, Mr. Bimii!

356
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,166
Talk about some
perfect timing, roar!

357
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,375
Did you invite everybody?

358
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,791
I don't think so.

359
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,750
I was too busy following
Eruna around as she bought food

360
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:40,916
to pay too much attention,

361
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,833
but she thinks
they'll all make it, ryui.

362
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,083
It's sweet of you
to help, Mr. Bimii!

363
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,583
Now, we just need Eruna to
let all the people she talked to

364
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,208
know the location
has changed to the roof.

365
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,750
Also, while you're at it,

366
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,708
do you mind dropping by and
giving this invitation to Asuhi?

367
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:55,958
Ryui...

368
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,458
I'm starting to think these kids

369
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,625
are trying to work
me to death, ryui.

370
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,833
Oh, it's Mr. Bimii.

371
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,083
Hello, sir!

372
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,625
[BIMII] Hi, Asuhi.
I've been looking for you.

373
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:14,166
I'm supposed to give you this
message from the drama club.

374
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,125
It's that the location
has been changed

375
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:20,041
to the roof of the dorm, ryui.

376
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,333
[BIMII] I'm sure
I'll see you later, ryui.

377
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,333
She's not back yet, ryui?

378
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,125
What are you gonna do?

379
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,916
[ERUNA]
What's this?

380
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,708
[ERUNA]
Fancy!

381
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,500
Looks like it's
a challenge offer!

382
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,083
I bet it's from someone
who wanted to learn

383
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:54,000
from this amazing
rookie battle quarterfinalist!

384
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,583
If I accept this challenge and
am super cool while I beat them,

385
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,583
the whole school
will be talking about me!

386
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,000
And that would be
awesome for my new

387
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,000
yet-to-be-named
and-formed club!

388
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,625
Yeah!

389
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,833
Eruna's not here. Huh...

390
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,916
No, and Seisa
hasn't shown up, either.

391
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm just assuming
Otone won't make it.

392
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,500
What happens if Asuhi
gets here before them?

393
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,458
I dunno, but we
should hide pretty soon.

394
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,208
Jeez, you guys
sure like surprises

395
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,541
for a group of people
who aren't surprising.

396
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,458
[footsteps]

397
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,791
It's him.

398
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:52,875
Look, she's here!

399
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:53,875
Crazy.

400
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,458
Maybe I came too early.

401
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,541
I knew I should have shown up
here fashionably late.

402
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,250
Shoot, I missed the chance to
have an awesome entrance!

403
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,583
It seems like Eruna might
be a little confused again.

404
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,625
Hello, Eruna.

405
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,583
Minatoga-what?

406
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,000
That's so
unbelievably flattering.

407
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,333
I never would've guessed
you were the one

408
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,250
who challenged me to a match!

409
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,083
I'm in, man!
Challenge accepted!

410
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,791
Uh, okay...

411
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,125
Don't mind if I do.

Excuse me?

00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,291
What? Asuhi, you're here?

415
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,375
Yeah, I heard that
the location had changed,

416
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,875
but I never found out what
was the location was for.

[ALL laughing]

418

Looks like our
surprise bombed, huh?

419
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,833
Yeah, guess so. Move out.

420
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,333
[SHIGURE]
Jump!

421
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,666
Stick it.

422
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,333
And now, we'll start the
surprise party of the year

423
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,708
with everyone's favorite emcee,
me, Shigure Ninomiya!

We love you, Asuhi!

Congratulations!

We're all proud of you
for winning second place

428
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,625
in the tournament!

Huh?

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,791
That's right!

The big star of today's party

You guys planned a party for me?

Thank you,
that's very kind!

You don't have to be
so proper about it.

For real.

It's no big deal, roar!

Aw, man!

443
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,791
I blame Bimii for
screwing up this whole day!

444
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,000
No, even if he
didn't screw up,

445
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,416
rain is still rain.

446
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,166
[TONKYUN] We were defeated
because we didn't check

447
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,416
the weather forecast.

448
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,416
Do you wanna
go somewhere else?

449
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,583
Doesn't the drama clubroom
have lots of space?

450
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,750
What?

451
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,458
You don't want to
wait a little longer?

452
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,208
Yeah, the rain
might stop, roar!

453
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,541
I hope it does!

It'd be so cool to have
the party under the stars!

00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,375
Me too!

456
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,708
I mean, we are having
this thing for Asuhi!

457
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,875
Wow, guys.

458
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,166
You all really are the best.

459
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,416
Did I ever tell you
what happened to me

460
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,916
when I was younger?

461
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,458
There's a story behind me
loving stars so much, you know.

462
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,416
Oh, really?

463
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,875
Well, what is it?

464
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,583
Y'see, I was
bullied as a kid.

465
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,291
I can't even remember
when it started.

466
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,333
The other boys
would pick on me.

467
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:31,500
Apparently, I wasn't tough
or manly enough for them,

468
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,083
or something.

469
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,041
At some point, I heard
that if you made a wish

470
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,583
three times on a falling star,
your wish would come true.

471
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,625
So then one day, I made a wish.

472
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:45,625
I wished with all my heart
that I could become strong.

473
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,958
I might've just
convinced myself of it.

474
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,916
But either way
because of that wish,

475
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,875
for the first time ever,
I stood up to my enemies.

476
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,333
For the first time ever,
I stood up for myself!

477
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,708
After that,
all those boys

478
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,666
stopped bullying me completely.

479
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,875
So that one wish
is why you love stars?

480
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,000
It is. They saved me.

481
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,583
[chuckles]

482
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:09,291
Well I guess he doesn't
actually smile all the time,

483
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,750
and go figure,
he's not perfect.

484
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,541
Sorry, it's nothing.

485
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,625
Killing Art.

486
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,083
[ERUNA]
Wow! Look at the sky!

487
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:59,125
[ALL exclaiming]

488
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,083
Right there's Arcturus.

489
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,250
It's a star near Spica
that's also known

490
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,333
as the star of happiness!

491
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,291
Whoa!

492
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,958
You know, Asuhi...

493
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,208
You may not realize it,

494
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:23,208
but you always manage
to shine just as bright

495
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,208
as that star up there does.

496
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:28,000
For what it's worth,
that's how I see it.

497
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,583
Cool.

498
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:37,291
[OTONE] Fujishiro saw
what you did for them.

499
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,791
[OTONE]
How fun!

500
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,958
Fuji witnessed the power
of Killing Art, didn't she?

501
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,791
[ASUHI] Confess!
What would you wish for

502
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,458
on a falling star, Eruna?

503
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,083
[ERUNA giggles]
Can I really say it?

504
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,625
[ASUHI]
Of course you can.

505
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,750
[ERUNA] Really? Well, don't
look at me if things get crazy,

506
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:31,041
because I'm gonna say it!
I might even say it three times!

507
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,750
I've got a list so long
I had to cram it all

508
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,750
into 158 journals!

509
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:35,833
[ASUHI]
The sun would rise again

510
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,375
before you could
say that three times.

511
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,375
[ERUNA]
And it's Asuhi with the retort!

512
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:40,791
Nice one. I approve!

513
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,375
You know what,
you're good as the funny man,

514
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:44,791
but still, you can be
a great straight man, too.

515
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:45,916
[ASUHI]
Thank you...?

516
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,583
So what would you
wish for, Fujishiro?

517
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,541
[OTONE] Fujishiro would
only wish for one thing:

518
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:52,208
World conquest, naturally.

519
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,750
I'm not joking, either.

520
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,958
Earlier, Fujishiro was working
out a dreadful, wicked plan

521
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:58,708
with the big four who serve
and love me unconditionally.

522
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,250
[ERUNA]
What?! The big four?

523
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,666
Oh yeah, the Cantopop boy band
from Hong Kong! Yes, please!

524
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,125
[ASUHI] I think she's talking
about four accounting firms.

525
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:07,458
[OTONE]
No, not those!

526
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:09,583
These big four are a
much more dreadful big four

527
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:11,083
than either of those fours!

528
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,250
They're so scary,
they'll make you wet yourself.

529
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,500
[ASUHI] Next time,
"Unidentified Treasure."

530
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:17,458
I'm going to defeat
the dreadful big four,

531
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:19,250
and then I'll
get to be number one!

532
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:20,291
[ERUNA]
Wait! They'll be here?!

533
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,041
[ASUHI]
Uh, no. Probably not.
