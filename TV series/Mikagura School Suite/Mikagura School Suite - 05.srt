00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,916
Get your fresh-made
noodles over here!

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,750
Noodles over here!

4
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,666
[BIMII] Eruna, I can't
carry any more, ryui.

5
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,958
Jeez, how many fried octopus
balls can one girl eat anyway?

6
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,000
You need to have more
faith in yourself, Bimii.

7
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,583
The only reason you
can't carry any more

8
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,125
is because you think you can't.

9
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:20,375
Look, if you give up, that's
the end of the octo balls.

10
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,791
Don't let go of the takoyaki.
Don't let go!

11
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,916
[BIMII] And yet, your mania
for takoyaki is mild

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,083
compared to the rest
of your obsessions.

13
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:30,250
Do you have enough points left
to spend on anything else now?

14
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,958
[BIMII] You've wasted
a lot on these suckers.

15
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,750
Wasn't your plan today
to try and be more frugal?

16
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,958
[ERUNA]
I forgot.

17
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,083
[BIMII] Yeah, that's
what I thought, ryui.

18
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,333
[ERUNA]
Seisa! Hi!

19
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,416
Did you watch my first
match in the rookie battle?

20
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,083
Because I like totally won
and looked way cool.

21
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,333
[SEISA]
Well, of course I did.

22
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,500
Eruna, I'm actually here
to give you a good luck hug

23
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,666
if you want one.

24
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,708
[gasps]

25
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:03,666
Well, that is, unless you
need more than just a hug.

26
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,583
Yes. More than a hug, please!

27
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,708
[SEISA]
Poor thing.

28
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,958
She must've hit her head pretty
hard during the rookie battle.

29
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,833
[BIMII] No. Believe it or not,
abnormal is her normal.

30
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,291
[ERUNA]
Hurry up, Seisa!

31
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,958
Come on, come on!

32
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,000
[laughing]

33
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,833
Look at all these
awesome food choices!

34
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,583
I want yakisoba and
okonomiyaki and takoyaki

35
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,958
and more takoyaki
and even more takoyaki.

36
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,750
[BIMII] So what I'm getting
here is that you might

37
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,166
be a fan of takoyaki.

38
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,541
Hey, Seisa, are you
craving anything specific?

39
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,375
[SEISA] I'm kind of in the
mood for something sweet.

40
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,458
Heck yeah!

41
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,791
Naturally, a sweet sauce
with takoyaki

42
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,166
is the best sauce with takoyaki,

43
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,583
which is why I got
a whole bunch!

44
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,958
It's so cool how you
always totally get me!

45
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,500
Oh, and you don't need
to worry about the points.

46
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,250
I'll just get what
I need from Bimii.

47
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,541
[BIMII] I'm starting
to get a little worried

48
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,208
about your
confidence in me, ryui.

49
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,416
[MINATOGAWA]
Step right up.

50
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,625
Would anyone by
chance like to play?

51
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,916
[ERUNA]
Is that Minatogawa?

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,791
Why is he running a booth alone?

53
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,125
[BIMII] Because he is
the one and only member

54
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,333
of the flower
arrangement club, ryui.

55
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,583
[ERUNA]
That's right.

56
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,083
The other members
never showed up, did they?

57
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,958
You know, even for him,
he seems really out of it.

58
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,333
Step right up to win...

59
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,000
It also looks like
he's trying to do that thing

60
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,583
where you smile so
you're more approachable,

61
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:55,875
but what's happening
on his face right now

62
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,625
is not what he's going for.

63
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,333
Hey! What's up, Minatogawa?
Keeping busy?

64
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,208
Hey. Doing what I can.

65
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,166
I never would've guessed
the flower arranging club

66
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,500
would have a shooting gallery.

67
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,250
Great idea!

68
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,375
Whoa, that's huge!

69
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,125
Guess what?
There's a big grand prize.

70
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:17,125
A genuine life-sized Super
Miracle Man action figure.

71
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,083
[ERUNA] Well it's way too big
to be knocked over

72
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,500
with one of those guns!

73
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,583
How old is that thing, anyway?
It looks like crap.

74
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,541
[MINATOGAWA] Guess what? He's an
old toy from my parents' house.

75
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,125
[ERUNA] It's used,
is that what you're saying?

76
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,875
Because if used is supposed
to make me want him,

77
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,250
it doesn't, like at all.

78
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,500
Oh, guess what?

79
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,041
He's got a little tear
in his boot right here.

80
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,208
[ERUNA]
You can't use that!

81
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,708
No one wants a torn prize!

82
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,083
Well, guess what?

83
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,750
He's my most prized possession.

84
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,750
[ERUNA] You're not
planning to give it away?

85
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,000
And guess what else?

86
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,166
[ERUNA] What else
could there possibly be?!

87
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,541
I gotta pee...

88
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,166
[ERUNA] Well then
go use the restroom.

89
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,166
And don't worry about the booth.
We'll keep an eye on it for ya!

90
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,000
I know I shouldn't say this,

91
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,958
but that kid
is strange, ryui.

92
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,375
[ERUNA]
What a bummer.

93
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,166
No one's coming to check
out this booth at all.

94
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,958
It might as well be freakin'
invisible, am I right?

95
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,041
I hope he didn't plan on
that thing bringing in money,

96
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,958
because Miracle Man
is looking rough.

97
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,583
And check out how janky
these other toys are, too.

98
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,500
I mean, uh, check out
how well-loved they are.

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,791
These are Minatogawa's
personal toys

100
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,541
from when he was a little boy.

101
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,833
[ERUNA]
"Sadamashi Minatogawa."

102
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,166
You're right!

103
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,875
And he spelled his name wrong,
which is adorable!

104
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,250
So he decided to use
his own toys from childhood

105
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,458
to be a part of his booth?

106
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,166
Maybe you gotta have
a flower arranging brain

107
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,375
to get what that's about.

108
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,958
He's normally by himself,

109
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,500
so having a booth might
have been what he thought

110
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,250
was a good way to have fun
with everyone else for a change.

111
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,833
[ERUNA]
I get it.

112
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,125
Well then, I'm going
to do whatever I can

113
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,958
to make this place rock!

114
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,458
Come on, step right up
and take your best shot, kids!

115
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,125
Flower arrangers'
shooting gallery!

116
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,416
We even have our own
perfectly-arranged mascot!

117
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,416
And remember, the beauty
who shot through my heart

118
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,625
with one look
is absolutely free!

119
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,875
[BIMII] Might want to
okay that with her first.

120
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:02,083
[YUTO] I had a feeling the voice
piercing my brain had to be you.

121
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,791
Of course you'd
bring Seisa along.

122
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,166
So what's the deal here?

123
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,875
Why're you guys pimping out
another club's booth?

124
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,458
That's so funny
because I had a feeling

125
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,041
the dark soul I could
sense nearby was you!

126
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,250
Wanna try out
the shooting gallery?

127
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,250
Special deal just for Yuto!

128
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,708
What? That's not a deal!

129
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,583
I literally stood here and
watched you mark it up

130
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,083
to a higher price!

131
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,750
Actors always have
such vivid imaginations.

132
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,416
[YUTO] Besides,
why would I pay anything?

133
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,125
Look at those crummy prizes!
Who'd want to win that?

134
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,125
No... way...!

135
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,416
[BIMII]
What's wrong, ryui?

136
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,666
You couldn't possibly want
that Miracle Man, could you?

137
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,666
No, I don't want
any of this crap!

138
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,083
I'm only wondering if something
as big as that Miracle Man

139
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,250
could actually be knocked over,
so you know, guess I can try.

140
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,041
Might as well see
if I can do it.

141
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh, nice!

142
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,708
It may not be your scythe,
but you still look pretty cool!

143
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,875
[BIMII] I think those kids
might be here as customers.

144
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,375
If they all
want to play, ryui,

145
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,250
oh boy, we're gonna
rake in the points!

146
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,541
You can do it, Yuto!
Knock him over!

147
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,916
[YUTO]
Who you talking to, Eruna?

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,083
This kind of thing is my jam!

149
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,541
[panting]

150
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,791
[YUTO]
Get it together. Focus.

151
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,541
Miracle Man,
you're gonna be mine!

152
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,000
[gasps]

153
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,666
[ERUNA]
It didn't even budge!

154
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,041
Uh oh, ryui.

155
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,625
All our new customers

00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,208
[BIMII]
That's great! What is it?

314
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,083
I don't know!

315
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,333
My brain is still downloading,

316
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,833
so I have to wait
for that to finish first.

317
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,291
[USAMARU yelling]

318
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,458
Dude, you just disconnected
my brain download!

319
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,541
[USAMARU]
Sorry, but this girl is so hot!

320
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,416
Show me!

321
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,625
Oh, yeah, she's wicked pretty.

322
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,583
Wicked pretty
is just my type!

323
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,541
[TONKYUN]
Azumi Sagara from the band.

324
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,833
Her expected ranking is fifth.

325
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,833
I think she might be your
next opponent, Usamaru.

326
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,416
Seriously?

327
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,333
[TONKYUN]
Is that a video of her?

328
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,125
[USAMARU]
I think so. Let's see.

329
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,708
[SAGARA] I'm Azumi Sagara,
a member of the band,

330
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,750
and my goal this year is to
make sure my musical performance

331
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,166
during the rookie battle
can be enjoyed

332
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,750
by as many of you as possible.

333
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,041
I hope to see you!

334
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,375
[USAMARU] That sweet thing
is my next opponent?

335
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,333
This is crazy!
Seriously crazy!

336
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,833
I feel like
forbidden love will bud

337
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,708
at the end of our
dramatic rookie battle!

338
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:55,916
No doubt about it.

339
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,916
My future passion is
staring me in the face!

340
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,500
Oh my. Yeah!

341
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,458
This is passion deluxe!

342
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,083
[ERUNA] So why doesn't
the drama club have a booth?

343
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,250
[TONKYUN] Because we don't
need more funds right now,

344
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,583
so we're taking
a break this year.

345
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,583
How could you guys
just walk away from me?!

346
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,708
Don't you even care
about my possibly probable

347
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,250
future passionate
love life like at all?

348
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,125
[TONKYUN]
No.

349
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,416
Nope.

350
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,416
[USAMARU] You know,
you could've at least lied

351
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,958
to make me feel better.

352
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,208
[ERUNA]
Ooh, they're drawing portraits!

353
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,791
[USAMARU]
It's the art club!

354
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,750
Hey, I'd like it if
you drew me, please.

355
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,291
[CLUB MEMBER 5A]
Sure, no problem.

356
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,625
Before we start,

357
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,666
I need to know what style
portrait you'd like.

358
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,791
Oh, that's easy.

359
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,208
Just make me feel
better about myself.

360
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,750
I want to look like a stud, man.

361
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,125
If you could
draw me in a way

362
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,000
that I didn't look like
who I am, that'd be perfect.

363
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,208
Okay...

364
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,333
[TONKYUN]
What you're asking for

365
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,750
isn't technically
a portrait, though.

366
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,625
Hey, over here!
I want one drawn too,

367
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,125
but I want a portrait where
Seisa is holding me tight

368
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,250
and gives me a kiss like
this with her pretty mouth,

369
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,541
because that would
be so awesome.

370
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,750
[TONKYUN]
Maybe it's me.

371
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,375
Maybe my whole life
I've never really known

372
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,458
what a portrait is.

373
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,250
Wait! You guys
are with the art club,

374
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,375
so I want Enoyan
to draw me, please.

375
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,208
[CLUB MEMBER 5A]
I'm sorry, who's Enoyan?

376
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,541
Kuzuryu, silly!

377
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,583
[laughs nervously]

378
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,958
Interesting.

379
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,916
That must be an inside joke
because I don't get it,

380
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,958
but either way, he's not here
what with being so busy and all.

381
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,916
Oh. Well that doesn't
really work for me.

382
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,750
In that case,
maybe I can help you.

383
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,416
What type of portrait
were you wanting?

384
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
[ERUNA]
Okay, so here's the thing.

385
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,958
I want you to draw something
inspired that also communicates

386
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,458
a story about this girl who
falls madly in love with me.

387
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,208
That's a lot
to put in one portrait.

388
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,541
Which is why I'd
recommend making it

389
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,708
a gigantic picture scroll story.

390
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,583
Oh, and this girl actually
looks like a goddess.

391
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,500
I mean like a real deal
walking-on-Earth goddess.

392
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,916
And she, like, on my cheek,
she pecks it a little.

393
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,708
After that, you know,
whatever moves you,

394
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,416
but you get the general idea.

395
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,041
Let the spirit move you,
as they say.

396
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,125
I saw you watching earlier.

Back at Minatogawa's booth.

398

Kuzuryu, don't you
want to have fun?

399
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,000
There are a lot
of kids in your club

400
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,166
that would like
to hang with you.

Forget about me.

I'm wondering what's with you
being social all the sudden.

403
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,166
I mean, no judgment.

404

You looked like you were having
a blast today with Eruna's crew.

Did I really?

406
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,833
Either way,
it doesn't have anything

407
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,916
to do with me, does it?

408
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,041

What has gotten into me?

416
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,375
I made it past
the second round!

417
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,750
This is starting to get hard.

418

At the same time,
it's really fun,

419
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,708
so that just makes me
want to fight even more.

ADD. Look it up, ryui.

422
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,666
I wasn't sure how
the second round would go

423
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,958
when you showed up late and
seemed more than a bit shaky,

424
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,416
yet leave it to you
to figure out a way

425
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,916
to pull it off in the end, ryui.

426
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,916
I wonder how
everyone else is doing.

427

The good news is that
so far Asuhi and Tonkyun

428
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,125
both won their second
round battles, too,

but the bad news is
at this rate,

there's no doubt
you'll eventually

have to fight them, ryui.

you felt this way sooner, Eruna?

Well, why not?

469
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,291
[SHIGURE] These things
aren't exactly his style.

470
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,083
Really? Why?

471
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,541
[BIMII] C'mon, Eruna,
if you don't hurry up,

472
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,291
Usamaru's match is going to
start before we get there!

473
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,625
[panting]

474
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,291
Please tell me this is
where the match is, Bimii!

475
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,166
It's supposed to be...

476
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,333
[ERUNA] Then why is the
whole crowd being so quiet?

477
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,000
Seisa, what's up?

478
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,291
I wanted to tell you
about tonight that...

479
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,875
Am I missing something?

480
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,541
Hey, Tonkyun?
Why is everyone acting so weird?

481
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:56,958
[gasps]

482
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,708
[USAMARU coughing]

483
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:04,166
[breathing heavily]

484
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,083
[ERUNA]
What's wrong?!

485
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,875
What happened to Usamaru?

486
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,166
[TONKYUN]
Her attack happened.

487
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:18,833
[loud cacophony]

488
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,833
Hold on, that can't be
the girl from the band!

489
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,708
Her attack looks insane!

490
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,500
[TONKYUN] Apparently,
she's using the pressure

491
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,125
from the sound she manipulates

492
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,000
to increase the gravity
of specific areas.

493
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,208
And that's not all.

494
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,458
[ERUNA]
She can fly?

495
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,375
So what, sound pressure
can manipulate gravity?

496
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,000
No matter what Usamaru does,
he won't be able to reach her.

497
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,875
How's that legal?
That's cheating!

498
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,125
No, this is just what happens

499
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,375
when their abilities
don't match up, ryui.

500
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,833
It may be horrible to watch,
but it is perfectly legal.

501
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,958
Well why hasn't she gone ahead
and broken his last crystal yet?

502
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,791
It's not like he can do
anything to protect himself

503
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,125
in the state she's put him in.

504
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,625
[TONKYUN]
She's toying with him.

505
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,750
Been doing it for a while now
and he can't resist.

506
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,791
She's just making a fool of him.

507
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,583
So not cool!

508
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,291
Oh, come on now, bunny boy,
why don't you give up already?

509
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,833
You've gotta know the truth.

510
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,666
You don't have a chance in hell
of winning this match,

511
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,375
so just surrender to me, kay?

512
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,916
Yeah, but don't you think
it would be cool as hell

513
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,375
if the underdog
could win this battle

514
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,875
after an unexpected comeback
move like in the movies?

515
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:19,875
[SAGARA]
Oh my god, no!

516
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,166
What are you thinking?

517
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,250
That would be
the opposite of cool.

518
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:29,208
[ERUNA]
Usamaru! Just jump!

519
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,375
Jump as high as you can
and kick her snotty self

520
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,208
back to the ground!

521
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,666
Did you hear that, bunny?

522
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,416
It sounds like you've got
a little rodent friend

523
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,791
cheering you on out there.

524
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,791
I imagine you want to
hippity hop over to her

525
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,583
like a good little bunny-boy.

526
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,500
Hop all you want,
though, flopsy mopsy.

527
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,666
No matter what you do,

528
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,375
you'll never be able
to reach me up here!

529
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:49,625
[cacophony continues]

530
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,833
[USAMARU]
Eruna...

531
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,333
I can't believe it...

532
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:55,458
You actually came to
cheer me on this time!

533
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,333
That's right!
And I'm not the only one!

534
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,166
Tonkyun came out
to cheer for you, too!

535
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,500
[USAMARU]
That makes me happy.

536
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,083
There's nothing more
passionately youthful

537
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,041
than an event where your
friends can cheer you on,

538
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,916
which means one thing
for this bunny boy.

539
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,333
I've got this!

540
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,291
[ERUNA]
Usamaru!

541
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,041
Didn't I say from
the very beginning

542
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,333
that bunnies were meant
to be hunted and taken down?

543
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,750
Why you didn't
just start crying then

544
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:28,208
and begging me to go easy
on you is beyond me.

545
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,833
What do you think
you're doing by actually trying?

546
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,750
You're ruining the fun
for the rest of everybody.

547
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,458
This is why I hate
these damn club battles.

548
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,625
[ERUNA]
Usamaru!

549
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,541
How could you lose
on me like that?

550
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,875
Why didn't you use the special
ability "Passionate Sweat"?

551
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:27,083
[BIMII] Because it's not
an actual ability, ryui.

552
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,041
[ERUNA] What about the
sultriness ability, then?

553
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,916
He condenses the steam created
by the hot air gushing from them

554
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,041
and then makes a
big, gaseous thing--

555
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,000
[BIMII] Sounds like
con funk to me, ryui.

556
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,291
[ERUNA] Okay, okay,
how about bare hands?

557
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,958
After they duke it out
by a dry river,

558
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:42,375
they make up by laughing
and rolling down the bank!

559
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:44,458
[BIMII]
Also not an ability, Eruna.

560
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:46,250
[ERUNA]
Why not? It's passionate youth,

561
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,833
which can be found
in the shadows at night

562
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:49,250
just before sunset.

563
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,458
[MINATOGAWA] The ability
"Youthful Bittersweet Memory."

564
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:52,666
[ERUNA]
Minatogawa?

565
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,500
[BIMII] What kind of
ability is that, ryui?

566
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:55,416
[MINATOGAWA]
Drool...

567
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,000
[ERUNA]
Huh?

568
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,125
[MINATOGAWA] When you imagine
yourself eating something sour,

569
00:24:58,208 --> 00:24:59,583
so it makes your mouth water.

570
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:03,041
[ERUNA] Uh... yeah,
I don't get it, like at all.

571
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,458
Anyone else maybe know where
Minatogawa is coming from

572
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:06,625
on this one?

573
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:08,500
[MINATOGAWA]
Next time, "Junk Innocence."

574
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:11,583
Perhaps Kuzuryu's past
will be revealed.
