00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:48,375
[OTONE] Even now you refuse
use your ability on Fuji?

2
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,833
If you'd rather me win than
use Killing Art, then so be it.

3
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,250
But when you lose, no excuses.

00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,458
[ERUNA]
Otone, don't!

What's going on?

One of you tell me!

10
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,625
[ERUNA]
Otone, say something!

11
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:14,958
Um, I--

12
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,625
Fuji is sorry, but she was
just thinking of Eruna.

13
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,666
She just wanted you to be happy!

14
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,583
Come on, don't run away!

15
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,541
I'm not mad. I'm just confused.

16
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,250
Why would you guys fight?

17
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,333
[ERUNA gasps]

[SEISA]
What is it?

22
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,791
Say what you want to say.
Get it over with.

23
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,500
[ERUNA]
It's just that...

24
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,833
You did make a club
with that girl, right?

25
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,416
Then, you need to stop
worrying about me

26
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,375
and focus on her instead.

27
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:58,375
Congrats.

28
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,083
Is that good enough?

29
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,583
Of course it is.

30
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:02,625
But I don't understand.

31
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,500
I said stop
worrying about me!

...you'll be next.

00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,500
Do you want scars like these?

00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,083
[YUTO] Looks like
something's got you down.

00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:25,958
[ERUNA gasps]

41
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,333
Oh, hey, you guys.

42
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,000
And uh, I'm not down,

43
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,583
I'm just lost in my awesome
daydreams per usual.

44
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,500
I was winning the
midterm battles,

45
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,583
and then totally
getting a harem! [laughs]

46
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,958
Hey, where did
your posse go?

47
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,583
We're not used to
seeing you by yourself.

48
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,833
Yeah, isn't Mr. Bimii
always with you?

49
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,583
[ERUNA]
Wait, now that you mention it.

50
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,583
Bimii?

51
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,958
No wonder my
shoulder felt light!

52
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,916
So is he your guardian angel
or your guardian devil?

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,291
[BOTH laugh]

54
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,583
I guess we're not the only ones

55
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,125
getting ready for
the midterm battles.

56
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,791
All the teachers
have to prepare, too.

57
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,083
That's true.

58
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,666
[TONKYUN] Has the I'll
Figure It Out Later Club

59
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,208
chosen a representative, yet?

60
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,041
[ERUNA]
No... Not exactly.

61
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,500
Well, let's see.

62
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,250
It'd probably make the most
sense to have Otone do it

63
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,791
since she won the rookie battle.

64
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,416
[USAMARU] Yeah, but you're
not taking into account

65
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,458
how much better
Eruna's gotten lately.

66
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,833
I mean, that
special attack alone

67
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,333
could take out a ton of people.

68
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,541
It's bad ass!

69
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,458
[footsteps]

70
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,291
Hey, Eruna.

71
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,875
Don't be so blue, sunshine!

72
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,333
Cheer up! It's a beautiful day!

73
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,208
Huh?

74
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,916
Fujishiro is always cheerful.

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,708
In fact, she is always
cent per cent cheerful.

76
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,041
Especially today, she's
like three times that,

77
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,666
so three hundred
percent cheerful.

78
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,041
Fuji has so much cheer that
it's becoming a problem.

79
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,000
Well, that's fantastic to hear!

80
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,458
So anyway, it's almost time
for the midterm battles;

81
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,833
which means the I'll Figure It
Out Later Club's first match!

82
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:48,833
And we still have to decide

83
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,416
who's gonna be our
representative.

84
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,125
[OTONE] Fujishiro doesn't
think she wants that position.

85
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,083
You should represent us.

86
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,291
She thinks that would
be better for the club.

87
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,083
I mean, you did form it so you'd
be able to face Seisa again,

88
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,083
but you can't do that
if you're not the rep.

89
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,708
[ERUNA]
Otone...

90
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,958
And I'm sorry about, yesterday.

91
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,791
Fujishiro didn't need to
get into your business.

92
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,250
She was wrong and acted
like a stupid jerk.

93
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,958
Whatever, so over it, girl.

94
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,416
Besides, how can
I be mad at you?

95
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,666
You did it for me!

96
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,416
[OTONE] Yeah, um, that
might have been a lie.

97
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,958
Fuji said she did it for you,

98
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,250
but it might have really been
for herself because Fuji...

99
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,708
She might have been a
little jealous of Seisa.

100
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,375
If you want to know the truth.

101
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:34,666
Fujishiro wanted to make
sure you would keep smiling.

102
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,000
I admire you the most
whenever you're happy.

103
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,625
And that's why you
should be our club rep!

104
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,375
Fight Seisa like you've wanted,

105
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,166
and make Fujishiro happy
because you're happy!

106
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,083
That was wicked profound.

107
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,333
[OTONE gasps]

108
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,458
Um, oopsie, Fuji might
have just said too much.

109
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,458
On that note, she'll
be on her way now.

110
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,583
She's busy.

111
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,666
Those thugs won't
beat up themselves!

112
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,750
[ERUNA]
Hold on!

113
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,166
You're not allowed to go.

114
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,333
[OTONE gasps]

115
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,250
Okay, fine. I'll be
the representative.

116
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,500
But you're still a member of the
I'll Figure It Out Later Club,

117
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,916
so you can't leave!

118
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,083
I need you, silly.
Help me train!

119

[giggles]

121
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,708
Well, I guess I don't
have much of a choice.

122
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,083
Be warned, though.

123
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,416
Fuji's not gonna hold back,
so you better be ready!

124
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,458
[ERUNA giggles]

[ERUNA whistles]

129
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,291
[OTONE]
Nice work.

130
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,500
But if you let yourself get
satisfied with this performance,

131
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,541
there's no way you're
ever gonna beat Seisa.

132
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,541
For real?

133
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,625
[OTONE]
For real.

134
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,500
When Fuji fought Seisa,

135
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,041
the only reason she
won was because

136
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,916
Seisa wouldn't
use Killing Art.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,083
If Seisa had used her ability,

138
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,875
Fujishiro would have
most likely lost.

139
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,291
That's so weird.

140
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,375
Why do you figure Seisa
decided to hold back with you?

141
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,041
[HIMI]
Hey, there you are!

142
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,416
Guess what, Eruna!

143
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,666
The tournament brackets have
finally been announced!

144
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,250
I have a feeling this
year's going to be

145
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,041
the wildest year ever!

146
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:13,041
[chattering]

147
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,458
Looks like if we both
advance like we should,

148
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,333
we'll get our chance, and fight
each other in the third round.

149
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,375
[SHIGURE gasps, chuckles]

150
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,541
[ERUNA] Look for Seisa's
going home club!

151
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,541
[OTONE] Fuji doesn't see
Seisa's club anywhere.

152
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,208
If you're looking for
the going home club,

153
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,791
they withdrew again this term.

154
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,041
[ERUNA, OTONE gasp]

155
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,458
[KATAI]
Talk about a relief.

156
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,041
Can you imagine if
we had to face Seisa?

157
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,708
Even you would've
had a difficult time

158
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,250
beating her, huh, Himi?

159
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,291
No, I would not have.
I'm insanely strong!

160
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,708
Let's say Seisa's as strong as

161
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,166
like, a hundred thousand

Well, I'm that strong,

just more Asian style
with a touch of dwarfism.

I wonder, my lady...

Come on, can't we just talk?

let me come inside!

Oh!

Kurumi, Seisa's home, isn't she?

186
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,166
Just give me one sec!

187
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,708
I really need to talk to her!

188

My lady said she does not
wish to see you right now,

C'mon, just go home.

That girl is
stubborn to a fault.

00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,500
She'd probably feel better
if she just fought her here.

I'm hardly one to talk.

I'll give you these!

got the perfect thing!

[ERUNA] Even if I can't
fight against Seisa.

208
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,333
I still need to focus on
winning so we can advance.

If I do that,

Well, thank you!

But I only won because
you helped me train!

221
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,333
You can't fool me, Light Otone.

222

I know you're the
one being so nice.

might want to come play!

You're nuts.

225

At the very least, you must've
been hit in the head pretty hard

226
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,708
to think getting past
round one matters.

227
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,541
You don't deserve
applaudissements.

228
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,500
For real, you don't even deserve
the C in congratulations.

Yeah, that's perfect!

230

That's exactly what
I needed to hear!

it with the affection!

--[OTONE] Hey!

off that dark business!

to watch the matches, then?

watch the idiot fights.

No way whatever that was,

256
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,250
was just an optical illusion.

[ERUNA]
Yeah.

This is the first time

262
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,333
Shigure and Kuzuryu have
ever fought each other.

263
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,916
Gah!

264
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,625
Seriously? How have they managed
to not have to battle until now?

265
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,041
I have no idea.

266
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,750
There have been a ton
of official matches,

267
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,708
and they're both
ridiculously strong.

268
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,250
You would think they
would have, but nope.

269
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,333
This fight is
number one for them.

270
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,583
[MINATOGAWA]
I know why.

271
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,166
Kuzuryu always gave up early.

272
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,208
[BOTH]
Huh?

273
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,541
Yep, it's weird.

274
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,000
In the matches right
before the ones

275
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,625
where he'd have to face Shigure,

276
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,625
he always managed to lose.

277
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,958
[OTONE]
Yeah, this isn't creepy at all.

278
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,208
Uh-oh, don't tell me
you're a big scaredy-cat?

279
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,541
No way. Are you
kidding Fuji, right now?

280
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,916
Because, like, she's
not afraid of anything.

281
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,583
Except for like...

...people who can't
tolerate gluten.

[ERUNA]
The photography club?

284
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,333
[OTONE]
That's kinda strange.

285
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,833
You'd think a photography
club would be a big deal,

286
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,958
but I've never seen it before.

287
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,500
I didn't notice it in the
tournoi brackets, either.

288
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,208
[OTONE]
Wait! You're going in?

289
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,500
Fujishiro isn't mentally
prepared to do that yet!

290

There's nothing to be scared
of. It's just an old room.

[ERUNA] Look at how many
expressions she's making.

299

I've never seen her like that.

What a beautiful sunset.

301
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:38,083
Almost like a picture

what took you so long?

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,125
And where's Eruna?

311
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,375
[OTONE]
Eruna's gone.

312
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,625
She disappeared into the
photography club room.

313
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,583
The door to the room
disappeared, too!

314
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,166
[KUZURYU] Looks like something
happened to Eruna.

00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:34,500
[cheering]

321
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,208
[BIMII] We're currently
in a different dimension

322
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,416
than the Mikagura Academy
you're used to, ryui.

323
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,458
[ERUNA] I figured that's
what was going on.

324
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,958
Why else would the sun never set

325
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,708
no matter how much
time has passed?

326
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,333
[BIMII] Did you know this
clubroom was actually

327
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,208
part of the school at one time?

328
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,583
Seisa used her Killing Art

329
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,083
to seal it away into a
different dimension.

330
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,458
Basically, she
transformed the room

331
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:58,208
into a space that no longer
exists in reality, ryui.

332
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,291
Why would she do
something like that?

333
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,083
Because she was hurt.

334
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,083
Seisa cared a lot about
someone in the photography club,

335
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,958
and that someone
betrayed her, ryui.

336
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm guessing the
betrayer took these?

337
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,375
Yep. They became close
pretty quickly.

338
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,500
It happened during
Seisa's first year.

339
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,791
Everything changed for her the
day before the midterm battles.

340
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,041
[BIMII] Back then, Seisa
was in the art club.

341
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,166
The other girl was
in photography.

342
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,958
Seisa became a model for
her upperclassman friend,

343
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,291
and the two girls
became very close, ryui.

344
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,666
Seisa respected her,

345
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,416
and in return, she loved
Seisa like a little sister.

346
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,375
But when it came
to battle ability,

347
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,208
Seisa was the overwhelmingly
stronger one.

348
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,750
And then, in the midterm
battles that year,

349
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,000
the two girls were scheduled

350
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,166
to face each other in
the first round, ryui.

351
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,083
And a tough one at that,

352
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,000
considering we're
fighting each other.

353
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,791
You realize I won't hold back?

354
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:52,916
You better not.

355
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,750
Plus, fair fights
are more fun anyway.

356
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,333
I couldn't be more excited.

357
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,916
[BIMII]
Seisa couldn't have cared less

358
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,916
about winning or
losing the battle.

359
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,333
She was just happy
to get the chance

360
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,166
to face someone
she looked up to.

361
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,041
Sounds a lot like
you, doesn't it?

362
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:12,083
[BIMII] Unfortunately, the other
girl saw things differently.

363
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,875
With the school's point
system at the time,

364
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,500
if you won, you'd get a lot
of points and attention.

365
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,916
But more importantly,

366
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,541
upperclassmen were not
supposed to lose to freshmen.

367
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,875
And she didn't really like the
idea of being crushed by Siesa.

368
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:24,916
So....

369
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,708
[SENPAI] Hey, Seisa,
I have a favor to ask.

370
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,125
[SEISA gasps]

371
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,375
[SENPAI]
Do you think...

372
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,833
Do you think you could
throw tomorrow's match?

373
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:33,875
[SEISA gasps]

374
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,541
[BIMII]
Seemed simple enough.

375
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,000
However, if Seisa
agreed, she knew

376
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,708
their entire relationship
would be meaningless.

377
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,916
[BIMII]
Which is why Seisa refused

378
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,291
to throw the match
for her, and then...

379
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,875
[explosion]

380
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,583
[BIMII]
They had an unauthorized battle

381
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,750
the day before
the official match.

382
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,458
Of course, it was
against the rules, ryui.

383
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:02,041
The upperclassman may not
have meant for it to happen,

384
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,375
but in the end...

385
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,291
[BIMII] Seisa was
seriously injured, ryui.

386
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,250
Her friend dropped out of
school and left the area.

387
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,125
The photography club
was disbanded.

388
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,875
[BIMII] And in order to erase
her memories with the girl,

389
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,416
Seisa used Killing Art

390
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,916
to seal off the ruined school
building and this clubroom.

391
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,166
That's when she created
the going home club,

392
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,291
and shut herself up
in her mansion, ryui.

393
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,666
[ERUNA]
Poor Seisa...

394
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,041
But I don't get it.

395
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,500
Why now?

396
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,458
Why is it showing back up
and disappearing like this?

397
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,291
Most likely because
Seisa's power has

398
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,916
started growing weaker, ryui.

399
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,375
--[ERUNA gasps]
--The bottom line?

400
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,625
The space is becoming unstable.

401
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,250
Yeah, that makes perfect sense.

402
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,500
It wasn't that Seisa
wouldn't use Killing Art

403
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,500
during her fight with Otone,

404
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,416
she couldn't use it!

405

[SEISA gasps]

406
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,250
[screams] No!

407
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,166
[KURUMI] Even without using
a power like Killing Art,

408
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,083
you still can only throw
things away or burn them.

409
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,708
[KURUMI]
Unless...

410
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,583
you're actually afraid to
get rid of them for good.

411
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,958
[KURUMI] Things may
disappear from this world,

412

but they remain in
our hearts and minds.

413
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,875
[KURUMI]
That's what memories are,

414
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,958
and they don't always have to be
bad, you know that, don't you?

[banging]

416
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,958
So, you're finally coming
at me like you mean it.

long time for this.

Why do you always try so hard
to sound like an honor student?

420
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,791
Are you wanting
to point out that

421
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,125
the great heroes
of the school can

422
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,500
care about us lowly
delinquents or something?

423
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,666
[SHIGURE]
I'm not an honor student,

424
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,041
and I'm not a hero, either!

425

The only thing I'm
trying to point out

426

is that it's about damn
time you and I fought!

fought with his rival

so no one could ever beat him.

Does that sound familiar
to you, too, rival?

00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,833
You gotta string 'em
along, even it is a lie!

477
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,625
[SHIGURE] Next time, a
trial awaits Eruna and me!

478
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:34,000
Will we be able to overcome
the numerous difficulties

479
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,708
and have the wedding
of our dreams!

480
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,000
[KUZURYU]
Wrong lie, man!

481
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,166
[ERUNA] Next time,
me and Seisa, and Himi,

482
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,958
and Otone, Katai, Rumina, and
every cute girl in the world

483
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,875
have a wrestling match
and it's in the mud--

484
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,333
[KUZURYU]
Not that lie, either!

485
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:47,833
[ERUNA]
Fine! Gah!

486
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:50,583
Next time, Enoyan and Minatogawa
spend a lovely spring day

487
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,583
on the north face of the Eiger,
studying cave cricket ecology.

488
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:54,416
[KUZURYU] Where are you even
getting this crap from?!

489
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,458
[SHIGURE] 
You'll just have to watch,

490
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,041
and see what happens
for yourself!

491
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,916
[KUZURYU] No, you don't get
to be clever about it, now!

492
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,375
[ERUNA] Next time, the big
finale! "Infinite Grand Finale"!

493
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:03,416
[SHIGURE]
It's the last episode,

494
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,791
but I have a feeling
it's a start!

495
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:06,250
[ERUNA]
Wait...

496
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,625
Do you mean it like, "Our
fight has only just begun"?!

497
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:10,041
Because that would really
suck for a last preview.
