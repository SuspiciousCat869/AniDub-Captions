Super Miracle Man's uncle
saw his true identity,

Back then, I loved hanging out

with my little brother.

10
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:03,333
He was a cool kid,
innocent and friendly.

Always making friends
wherever he went.

And then there was me.

I was the complete opposite.

If my brother was
the one out in front,

15

I was the one in the back.

I was left behind.

so she left without me.

If I wanted
to fool everyone else,

32

I had to start with myself.

Dark Chaos Gang

160
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,000
is running wild
and rampaging the city!

161
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,625
After-School Six,
move out! Now, roar, roar!

162
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,708
Heck yeah!

163
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,291
Here comes my
Passionate Tornado Kick!

164
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,708
Clip-clop, clip-clop.

165
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,583
Let's finish off
the Dark Chaos Gang!

166
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,333
Toy Gun, tension max,
go get 'em!

167
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,041
We know you can
do way better than that.

168
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,208
Let's take it back once more,

169
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,750
and make sure you
get it down this time!

170
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:05,333
Sir!

171
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,000
Tension max, go!

172
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:07,708
Go!

173
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,583
Go, tension max go, go!

174
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,250
Go, tension max,
stop being such a jerk!

175
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,583
[yells]

176
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,041
Oh, After-School Noodles!

177
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,458
Are you okay, roar?!

178
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,833
No. I'm sorry,
but it's too late for me.

179
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,583
No, Noodles!
Don't be so stupid!

180
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,166
Without six of us, we can't
be the After-School Six!

181
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,333
You can't just give up.

182
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,875
Not now, not when
you're so close.

183
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,875
The limitless express
train of passionate youth

184
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,750
won't wait for you, Noodles!

185
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,958
Oh, do you mean it,
After-School Private?

186
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:33,750
[TONKYUN]
Come, Noodles.

187
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:34,958
We shall fight to the end.

188
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,375
Forever!

189
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:40,750
Thank you, After-School
Second Division, and scene.

190
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:41,708
Not bad.

191
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,458
Now stand up and make it great!

192
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,333
Playing the drama is fun!

193
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,250
[ERUNA]
I got it!

194
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,500
If they come at me here, I--Wah!

195
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,541
If it's this way, I--Gah!

196
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,708
Find the opponent's
opening and quick--Ow!

197
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,375
I can't sleep.
Will you quit being so noisy?

198
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,916
Squee! It's a sneak attack
from the side!

199
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,250
What're you reading?

200
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh, this brilliance
is the official script

201
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,625
for the After-School Six.

202
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,333
It's actually more like
a strategy guide

203
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,500
for the rookie battle

204
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,833
that Yuto was nice
enough to write for us.

205
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,791
The drama kids have
been helping me a lot.

206
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,708
I'm so much better already!

207
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,500
Feel free to have
high expectations.

208
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:21,000
I think you're gonna fall
in love with me all over again!

209
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,291
Hey! I was wondering...

210
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,791
Do you mind telling me
what kind of attack

211
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,583
your Killing Art move is?

212
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,333
[ERUNA]
During the practice match,

213
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,500
everything happened so fast

214
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,083
that I couldn't really
see what you did.

215
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,666
Sorry, but I'd really
rather not talk about that.

216
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,958
Huh? Okay.

217
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,208
Then, would you
rather talk about

218
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,750
what color your underwear is?

219
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:46,083
[SEISA] No. I don't want
to talk about that, either.

220
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,958
Whoa, Seisa's so
enchanting when she acts shy.

221
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,791
[footsteps running]

[KUMANO]
Sorry I'm late, roar!

224
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,125
I wanted to make sure
I got a ton of food

225
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,666
so you guys could keep your
energy up, roar! Go team!

[ALL cheering]

227
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,875
[TONKYUN]
Oh. Hold on.

228
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,250
This is a stamina
pork bowl, isn't it?

229
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,333
[KUMANO] Oh my gah.
I'm so sorry!

230
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,000
Please don't think I want you
to be a cannibal or anything!

231
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,333
[TONKYUN] Just because
Nyamirin gave me a pig costume

232
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,291
doesn't mean I'm an actual pig.

233
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,375
It's not cannibalism.

234
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,541
[KUMANO]
Oh, good.

235
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,250
Pigs are delicious,
regardless, though!

236
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,041
[TONKYUN] Do you mind if
we could all start calling me

237
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,375
by my real name now?

238
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,208
It's actually--

239
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,375
Heck yeah!

240
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,833
Lucky me got a ton
of red pickled ginger

241
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,958
in my awesome pork bowl!

242
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,041
[BIMII]
Ryui. Ryui.

243
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,708
[TONKYUN] I don't eat pork,
so you can have it.

244
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:37,916
Because cannibalism?

245
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,541
Tonkyun, say it ain't so!

246
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,375
[TONKYUN]
It ain't so.

247
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,875
I just don't dig on swine.

248
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,375
I'll give you
a piece of mine, too,

249
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,583
if you want it, Gorilla!

250
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:45,666
Gorilla?

251
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,458
[makes gorilla noises]

00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,333
[ALL laughing]

253
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,958
Man, the After-School Six
is really killing it, you know?

254
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,333
You'd think being the only one
whose power hasn't awakened yet

255
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,250
would bum me out, but I'm good.

256
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,458
[ERUNA] If you could choose it,
what would your attack be?

257
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,416
[USAMARU] I'd want something
that only the lead in a movie

258
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,750
would have.

259
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,125
I'm thinkin' like, uh,
Super Miracle Man's style.

260
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,791
He was the greatest!

261
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,083
Oh! I remember him!

262
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,125
I used to watch that show
when I was a kid!

263
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,083
[KUMANO]
Hey, I did, too, roar!

264
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,375
Yeah, that guy had
like the best catchphrase

265
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,583
of all time!

266
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,375
[ALL] Protect the royalties
from the tell-all book!

267
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,333
Super Miracle Man has arrived!

268
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,833
Hey, bro. What's wrong?

269
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,083
Sorry.

270
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,666
I just remembered
something I had to do.

271
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,958
What is up with him?

272
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,916
[SHIGURE] Thank you so much for
your patience, dear admirers!

273
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,500
The time has finally come to
reveal the tournament brackets

274
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,166
for this year's rookie battle!

275
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,916
The emcee
will naturally be me,

276
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,333
manga research
club president and rep.

277
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,708

hear the real deal pervy intel

[SHIGURE]
Eruna!

282
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,250
I see you back there!

283
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,833
Look everyone, it's my
gorgeous and talented cousin!

284
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,333
How embarrassing.

285
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,041
I wish there was a big hole
so I could kick him into it.

286
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,666
That's very 300 of you.

287
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,375
[NYAMIRIN]
What's up, our girl Noodles?

288
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,333
Hey, what's up with you,
After-School Six?

289
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,000
Wait, why isn't Yuto here?

290
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,500
[TONKYUN]
Apparently, he is absent today.

291
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,291
Talk about crummy timing, right?

292
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,750
The rookie battle
starts tomorrow,

293
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,541
so today's our
last day together.

294

Here we go!

The tournament brackets
shall be revealed!

298
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,750

Finally.

just use your device?

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,458
[ERUNA]
All right.

303
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,708
Who am I up against first?

00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,791
Fun! It's Katai!

So cool.

more and more interesting!

this is the end!

308

today count like never before!

Yeah!

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,333
Yuto. I hope he's okay.

00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,458
[YUTO]
Hey there, Seisa.

312
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,333
Unusual to see you at school.

313
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,500
Hey there, Yuto.

314
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,125
Unusual to see
you sans followers.

315
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,375
I guess so, just thinking
about a character thing.

316
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,250
What kind of role is it?

317
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,958
A tough role,
harder than any other.

318
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,000
This guy's loved
by everyone he meets.

319
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,875
Needed by them, too.

320
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,000
And that's really what
he wants for himself.

321
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,541
But one day, a girl
shows up out of nowhere

322
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,208
who can see completely
through his façade,

323
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,250
and there's a boy, too,

324
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,541
and they're just
so alike, but...

325
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,500
Every time he looks at the boy,

326
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,000
he realizes that all
he's doing is trying to copy

327
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:12,416
that exact same nauseatingly
sweet and innocent personality.

328
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,666
It irritates the hell
out of him, and scares him,

329
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,166
but if he loses his mask,
no one will like

330
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,166
or need the guy anymore.

331
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:26,541
He's had a rough past,
and those memories don't help.

332
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:30,666
Well, if it were me,
I would let go of that past.

333
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,250
Take away its power.

334
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,833
How would you do that?

335
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,875
Let go of all the people.

336
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,500
The things I went through...

337
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,541
I would block everything out.

338
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,833
[ERUNA]
Yuto!

339
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,833
Hey, I didn't
know you'd still be here!

340
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,458
[ERUNA]
Yep!

341
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,708
Nice work, then.

342
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,666
After today, I guess
the After-School Six

343
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,708
is disbanding to
start something new.

344
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,375
Although, I can't say
I'll be disappointed

345
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,416
to have the drama club
back to normal.

346
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,250
Sorry I was gone.

347
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,250
I'm just, uh, bad at goodbyes.
You know how it is.

348
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,791
[ERUNA]
Don't be silly!

349
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,083
It's not a goodbye because
once I start my brand new club,

350
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,833
I'll bring my
brand new members over!

351
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,166
Then we'll brand
new battle each other!

352
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,541
Can you tell me something?

353
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,375
Because I can't figure it out.

354
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,750
Huh?

355
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,208
When did you realize the
truth about who I really am?

356
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,458
[YUTO]
Why didn't you say anything

357
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,291
even though you knew
this whole thing I do

358
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,708
was just an act?

359
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:43,833
I just don't understand
why you'd stick around, Eruna.

360
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,500
I guess because...

361
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,625
Because I also
realized something lame

362
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,750
like that shouldn't
mean we can't be friends.

363
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:53,666
[YUTO]
What?!

364
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,000
[ERUNA]
Uh... It's no big deal.

365
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,541
Besides, I'm pretty sure
everyone else

366
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,416
knew what was up, too.

367
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:02,791
[USAMARU]
Guess who!

368
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,333
Yuto, my man,
you're here! Great!

369
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,500
[NYAMIRIN]
Well, hello!

370
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,416
Glad you made it!

371
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,541
Welcome back!

372
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,291
We thought that
we needed a party.

373
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,000
It's to honor the end of an era!

374
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,875
We bought so much food,
we're gonna be sick, roar!

375
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,208
[TONKYUN]
Yuto, what would you like?

376
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,208
I wouldn't let them get pork
miso soup this time,

377
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,375
so you know.

378
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,708
[NYAMIRIN]
There's pork bone ramen, though!

379
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:21,416
[TONKYUN]
Seriously?

380
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,166
[ALL laugh]

381
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,458
[KURUMI]
Excuse me.

382
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,791
Are you looking for something?

383
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,375
I haven't been able
to find the idiot anywhere.

384
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,000
I became concerned
that she might have

385
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,791
snuck into your
room again, my lady.

386
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,541
[phone beeping]

387
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,000
Can you see my face?

388
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,500
I just wanted
to tell you in person

389
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,083
that I'll be spending
the night with

390
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,625
the After-School Six in Yuto's
room instead of at your place!

391
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:54,833
Get over here, Eruna.

392
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,375
Tonkyun took off his mask!

393
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,625
I've never seen his face!

394
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,583
We should call you
CutieTonks, roar!

395
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,416
So sorry to abandon you
so soon after moving in,

396
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,750
but to make it up to you
and keep you from being lonely,

397
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,083
I'll leave you with
a goodnight Eruna kiss.

398
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,750
[kissing noises]

399
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,708
Seems you will be able
to sleep peacefully

400
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,583
this evening.

401
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,833
Have a wonderful night, my lady.

402
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,208
Okay. Let's see.

403
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,375
Where will I be fighting?

404
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,666
[yells]

405
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,250
Ouchie.

406
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,333
Here.

407
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,375
[ASUHI]
Oh. Thank you!

408
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,708
It's weird.

409
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,208
You're so much like him.
My little brother, I mean.

410
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,708
Well, get to that match
and do your best.

411
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,458
I will!

412
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,666
[BIMII]
Even with all the practice,

413
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,375
your Toy Gun is
still unstable, ryui?

414
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,250
[ERUNA]
Not worried.

415
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,541
I'm feeling confident.

416
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,333
Even if I can't get
my special attack to work,

417
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,375
I still have a lot of
other stuff I can do now

418
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,708
thanks to working with
the After-School Six.

419
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,208
Were you as surprised
about this as me?

420
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,041
I hope you know that
I aspire to be like you,

421
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,291
but at the same time,

422
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,875
I also feel like getting
revenge for Himi's loss.

423
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,625
I wanted to
fight you eventually.

424
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,333
Just never imagined
the opportunity

425
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,958
would present itself so soon.

426
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,083
Let's make it a great fight!

427
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,208
Sure! I can do that!

428
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,958
Seisa, you came all
this way to watch, huh?

429
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,250
Must be curious.

430
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,791
Who, me? Nope, not at all.

431
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,958
[DEVICE]
Begin the match.

432
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,875
[ERUNA yells]

433
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,166
This is like so much fun, right?

434
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,041
Yeah, totally fun!

435
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,333
I wanted to win
without using this,

436
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,583
but oh well, look out!
Here it comes!

437
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,833
Cutie Ink!

438
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,708
Now that's cool!

439
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,833
Heck yeah,
my tension's building up!

440
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,916
[yelling]

441
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,791
[yelling]

442
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,833
[KATAI] By the way,
I won't run out of ammo!

443
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,541
It's almost over!

444
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,583
Man! So intense!

445
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:34,041
[ERUNA yelling]

446
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,708
I'm ready to go
guns a-blazing if you are!

447
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,791
[ERUNA]
Tension max...

448
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,875
Toy Gun, go!

449
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,125
One more for show!

450
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,333
[DEVICE]
Winner, Eruna Ichinomiya.

451
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:25,791
[cheering]

452
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:33,083
I definitely lost, but hey,
at least it was a fun fight!

453
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,000
Go win the tournament now.

454
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,125
You think you can do it?

455
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,500
Duh!

456
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,750
[ERUNA]
I can use Toy Gun again, people!

457
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,375
It's all thanks to those
crazy drama club kids.

458
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:25,333
The After-School Six are going
to last forever and ever, amen!

459
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:26,708
I'll keep training,
and next I'll learn

460
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:27,958
how to use a real gun!

461
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,750
[BIMII]
No real guns for you, ryui!

462
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,125
[ERUNA]
Are fake guns okay, then?

463
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,458
[BIMII] No, you'll still
look like a criminal, ryui!

464
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:35,458
[YUTO] Would that be like
a "Fake Handgun" ability?

465
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,208
[BIMII]
Let the fake gun go, ryui!

466
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,250
[YUTO]
It'll trick your eyes.

467
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,833
[BIMII]
No tricking anything, ryui!

468
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,416
[ERUNA] What about
the ability "Fake Money"?

469
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,375
[BIMII] Stop it,
this is getting dangerous, ryui!

470
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,500
Can we just do
the preview already?

471
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:47,583
[YUTO]
Next time, "School Fantasia."

472
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:49,708
The rookie battle
rushes toward its climax.

473
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,666
Will Usamaru's ability
finally awaken,

474
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,708
and whatever could it be?

475
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:53,916
[ERUNA]

It's called "Passionate Sweat,"

it can break crystals!
