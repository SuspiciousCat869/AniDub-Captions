who built our school:

00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:40,958
Mikagura, Ichinomiya, and
Ninomiya family ancestors.

105

They worked together
to create this place.

And that mysterious
power we all have?

109
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,125
Mikagura Academy was built
in order to teach people

110
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,958
how to use their
abilities properly.

111

But what mattered the most
to them might surprise you.

112
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,375
They really just wanted
everyone to have fun.

113

In order to teach that, though.

114
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,625
They had to have a venue.

115
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,916
So the Mikagura
ancestor used her power

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,250
to create something
out of nothing here.

117

from the ground up overnight.

According to rumors,

131
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,583
around the time this
Academy was built,

so you better get ready!

318
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,666
I was hoping you'd say that.

319
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,083
[ERUNA giggles]

320
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,666
[DEVICE]
Begin the match.

321
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,250
[ERUNA grunts, pants]

322
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,916
[ERUNA grunting]

323
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,583
[SEISA grunting]

324
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,625
[ERUNA gasps]

325
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,041
What's the deal? Why haven't
you used your power on me, yet?

326
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,625
Because you're not able to
use your Killing Art on me.

327
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,208
I just wanna make sure
this fight of ours

328
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,958
is fair and square, lady!

329
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:06,541
[ERUNA yelps]

330
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,125
[ERUNA groans]

331
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:50,791
[ERUNA laughs]

332
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,000
[ERUNA] Seems like your
power's come back full force.

333
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,666
Yes, apparently, it has.

334
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,083
[ERUNA] I guess we can finally
start the real fight, then!

335
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,833
Killing Art, go!

336
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,208
[OTONE] What in the world
is happening up there?

337
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,125
[BIMII] I'll tell you what's
happening up there, ryui!

338
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,333
They're completely ignoring
the laws of physics!

339
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,916
It's phenomenal, ryui!

340
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,375
[OTONE] 
Wow, look at them go!

341
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,083
[ASUHI]
They must be having so much fun!

342
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,125
[SEISA] Might as well
decide this thing soon.

343
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,375
Killing Art!

344
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,958
[ERUNA laughs]

345
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,000
Tension, super max, go!

346
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,083
[ERUNA yells]

347
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,333
[SEISA yells]

348
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:23,166
Let's go!

349
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,541
[DEVICE]
End of the match.

350
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:51,375
[cheering]

351
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:58,750
[ERUNA laughs, pants]

352
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,083
That was so fun!

353
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,791
Thanks for fighting.

354
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,291
But unfortunately...

355
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,916
I couldn't win.

356
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,500
[SEISA] You didn't technically
lose, either, though.

357
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:09,708
So...

358
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,875
[ERUNA]
Huh?

359
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,333
I guess I wouldn't mind
joining your club.

360
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,458
[ERUNA gasps]

361
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,541
[laughs]

362
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,416
Oh, thank you, Seisa!

363
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,708
You're the best ever!

364
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,083
Take it down a notch.

365
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,416
By the way, I wasn't joking.

366
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,916
You're gonna have to come
up with another name.

367
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,500
You don't have to worry
about that.

368
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,375
I just thought of one.

369
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,041
Okay, what is it?

370
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,541
Afterschool Paradise Club!

371
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,833
[giggles]

372
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,666
And tell me, what is
that club supposed to do?

373
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,333
Seisa!

374
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,750
We can do anything we want!
