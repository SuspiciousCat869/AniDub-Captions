[ERUNA]
Who, me?

3
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:48,625
Just shining bright like a
diamond on "Isle Eruna"!

4
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,166
'Scuse me...

5
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,750
But I really need to get the
interview portion started now.

6
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,125
Thanks again for this.

7
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:58,041
I'm Rumina Rikyu, the newspaper
club representative.

8
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,375
That was your first battle.

9
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,625
Talk about a
spectacular debut, huh?

10
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:02,541
Maybe.

11
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,333
So how exactly did you win?

12
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:05,666
How'd I win?

13
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,041
Um, let's see.

14
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,875
Well, I suppose you could say
I won because of fate.

15
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:13,750
I was ready to embrace an
opportunity when it arose.

16
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:16,291
I've been told this
is called an "awakening."

17
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,166
You know,
like something magical.

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,750
Interesting perspective.

19
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,541
[ERUNA] Um, what is
that supposed to mean?!

20
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:22,791
You act like I'm not right!

21
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,291
What is this interview about?

22
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,833
I thought it was to like
make everyone feel guilty

23
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,750
for not believing in me?

24
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,541
[RUMINA] Do you not feel
as if you share this victory

25
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,500
with anyone?

26
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,166
Actually, I do!

27
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:37,083
That was such a
wonderful fight, Eruna.

28
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,250
It's true.

29
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,833
You are the new hero
of Mikagura Academy.

30
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:41,916
However...

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,791
I wonder if you
would mind being a hero

32
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,500
I could keep all to myself?

33
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,666
Nope! I wouldn't mind at all!

34
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,875
Well, that's it
for the interview.

35
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,041
I'll just be on my way.

36
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,125
Seisa, let's be
together forever!

37
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,958
[ERUNA]
Holy crap, this is so good!

38
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,916
I can't believe I'm getting
to eat such fancy food

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,166
for breakfast!

40
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,583
This is thanks
to the points I got

41
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,500
from winning
yesterday's match, isn't it?

42

[STUDENT] "Here, I didn't
eat all of my sandwich,

43

so you can have
the rest if you want."

44
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,166
The days of filling my empty
stomach with the rejected crusts

45
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,791
someone gave me are over!

46
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,916
This soliloquy
is depressing, ryui.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,333
[KATAI]
Hey, Eruna!

48
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,250
You were amazing!
Amazing amazing!

49
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,708
I mean I was shocked Himi lost,
but I was so happy for you!

50
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,083
You seem so calm,

51
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,791
but you've gotta be
freaking out on the inside now!

52
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,958
Thank you,
former sleeping-bag bestie!

53
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,666
Your bag is always there if
you want to come back to it.

54
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,125
Thank you, but no.

55
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,208
Oh, don't be shy.
You're so freaking adorable!

56
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,958
[KATAI]
It's the drama club!

57
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,958
Hey, Eruna.

58
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,708
I guess you decided to grace us
with your presence after all!

59
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:23,958
Why would you say that?

60
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,583
Did ya see the newspaper
club's extra edition?

61
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,583
Check it out.

62
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,750
Let's see.

63
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,916
Talk of the School!

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,250
"New Student Eruna
Ichinomiya Lives it up

65
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,833
Starting with Breakfast?"

66
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,208
This has nothing whatsoever

67
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,250
to do with the interview
we had yesterday!

68
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,041
And when the hell
did she take this pic?

69
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,000
[laughs]

70
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,250
Come on, don't get upset.

71
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,833
I think it's cool
that the article shows

72
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,666
who you really are,
behind the scenes.

73
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,875
[ERUNA growls]

74
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,333
[YUTO] Besides,
now the whole school thinks

75
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,666
you're a shoo-in to win
the rookie battle coming up.

76
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,083
Rookie battle?

77
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,583
A tournament where new students
compete with each other.

78
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,250
Since the competition
eventually impacts

79
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,500
the structure of the school,

80
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,500
it's considered an
important event, ryui.

81
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,541
What? No one told me about that!

82
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,125
Yo! My name's Usamaru,

83
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,333
and I'm a
first year here, too!

84
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,583
By the way, you were like
wicked cool in that fight!

85
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,083
Your passion was inspiring!

86
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,333
Don't get
I won't lose to you, but...

87
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,708
--Agh! I love your passion!
--[ERUNA] Calm down.

88
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,875
Maybe we could use
our inside voice?

89
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,458
This is my inside voice!

90
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,541
I can't help it!

91
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,916
I'm just a
passionate guy by nature!

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,333
[TONKYUN] I learned
from watching, as well.

93
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,333
[NYAMIRIN]
This pig's a first year, too.

94
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,291
I like to call him Tonkyun.

95
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,833
Tonkyun?

96
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,916
[TONKYUN] Nyamirin, how many
times do I have to tell you?

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,083
I'm not a pig, and I'd
rather you not call me that.

98
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,625
Oh, my actual name is-- 

99
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,875
Growl!

100
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,250
I'm looking forward to
the rookie battle, roar!

101
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh! I am Kumano,
a second year student.

102

Roar!

103
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,125
Wow, cute but crazy.

104
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,291
[YUTO]
I think it's safe to say

105
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,666
you surprised everyone
in the drama club.

106
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,541
I mean, the only
other person at school

107
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,833
who can activate their
power without using an item

108
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,875
is Seisa,
and she's, like, legit.

109
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,416
That's not all that surprising.

110
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,958
We have a mutual love
between us,

111
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,791
so it's safe to say our bodies
and souls are basically one.

112
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:02,791
Oh, crap!

113
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,083
I didn't tell her
that I won yet!

114
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,125
Damn it!

115
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,958
Later, taters!
I gotta go find her!

116
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,875
[BIMII]
Wait! Eruna! Come back, ryui!

117
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,416
Thank goodness
that wasn't awkward,

118
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,625
right, you guys?

119
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,250
I think it's so cool
how honest she can be

120
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,541
about her life and love
and like, you know.

121
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,125
I'm just gonna shut up now.

122
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,958
[ERUNA]
Yay, I'm back!

123
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,875
And why do you think
she'll let you in this time?

124
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:25,958
Because, duh,

125
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,333
I've totally prepared
a secret weapon

126
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,250
that's gonna
be a sure thing!

127

[doorbell rings]

128

[ERUNA in male voice]
Ding-dong!

129
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,500
Package for Miss Mikagura!

130
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:40,125
It's an extra-extra
extra-large ham!

131
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,333
[BIMII] I think you meant
to say hamster, ryui.

132
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,250
Whatever. The point is
she won't be able to say no

133
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,708
to Himi's cuteness and
she'll have to open the gate!

134
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,625
No way those gates will open.

135

[BOTH scream]

136
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,083
Jeez. You tricked me.
But chips help, so...

00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,625
Sorry not sorry!

138
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,000
You were only allowed inside
because my lady was interested

139
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,250
to hear your thoughts
on the battle yesterday.

[bell rings]

[KURUMI] My lady, I have
brought the idiots at the gate

142
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,541
to see you.

00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,458
The creature is here, as well.

[ERUNA] I'm in the room
where my goddess lives!

This is where she probably...!

00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,583
Yep, it is where
she probably...!

148

They smell like Bulgarian roses!

00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,916
Guess what, Seisa!

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I fought the good fight
and won the battle!

163
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,666
The honor of the going-home
club has been secured!

164
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,791
Now, feel free to praise me!

165
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,000
I always do better when
people sing my praises!

166
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,791
Go ahead, Seisa.
I'm humble and ready.

167
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,708
Oh, who's a good girl, Eruna?

168
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,041
You're a good girl!

169
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,583
Oh my yay!

170
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:20,458
This might be the highlight
of my whole entire living life!

171
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,125
[SEISA]
However...

172
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,291
If we're honest...

173
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,958
I think a large part
of your victory

174
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,000
can be attributed to Himi

175
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,958
mistakenly letting
her guard down.

176
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,291
[gasps]

177
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,625
Himi, if you had gone
for the win from the start

178
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,041
like you should have,

179
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,250
it would have been virtually
impossible for Eruna

180
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,208
to get to your crystals
before you broke hers.

181
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:37,958
Am I wrong?

182
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,250
[HIMI]
No. I guess not.

183
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,875
[ERUNA]
Yes, you are so wrong!

184
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,208
You guys are looking
at a natural chosen hero.

185
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,125
I mean like "from
the school hero" chosen.

186
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,666
Why else would I have
been able to defeat Himi?

187
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,416
And on the first try, at that!

188
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,708
I know my words
don't make sense,

189
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,958
but just trust me on this!

190
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,541
In fact,

191
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,916
I bet I could put up a decent
fight against you, too, Seisa!

192
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,000
How nice.

193
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,666
You seem to be very confident.

194
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,250
Just remember
this was your idea.

195
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,791
Tomorrow after school works.

196
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,833
You and I are going
to have a practice battle.

197
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:16,416
If you can somehow manage to
break even one of my crystals,

198
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,833
I will allow you to officially
join the going-home club.

199
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,958
On the other hand,
if you can't do it,

200
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,666
then I will revoke your
provisional membership

201
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,833
and you will go back
to being sans club.

[SEISA]
What do you say?

204
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,083
Uh, no way!

205
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,666
No matter how good she is,
she'll still lose.

206
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,291
That's way too hard, ryui.

207

Yeah! I'm in! Let's do it!

208
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,625
[ERUNA]
If I break even one,

209
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,000
I'll officially be in
the going-home club!

210

And then, I'mma live in
this phat mansion with you!

[BIMII, HIMI groaning]

212

[BIMII] She added her own
condition to the deal, ryui!

It's totally her.

She's that new girl
who owned Himi

from the calligraphy club.

217
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,708
I heard she's
having a practice battle

218
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,916
with Seisa today.

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,375
This is everything!

220
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,541
I've always wanted to be famous!

221
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,291
But you need to
get it together, now.

If you can't play it cool,
girl, don't play.

Wait for me!

224
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,166
Once I finish my
battle with Seisa,

225
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,833
I'll pretend to be a patient who
sexually harasses the new RNs

226
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,333
by giving them suggestive orders

while you all join me
in the nurse's office!

I can't even imagine
what's going on in your head.

want to, either.

It's a training room, ryui.

00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,166
You can watch other people's
battles and learn from them.

you doing right now?

a practice match with me?

No, he should battle me.

I mean, you haven't
seen these battles yet.

You might want to watch
a legit practice match

before you try to fight in one.

Maybe it's just me,

00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:28,583
but don't you think
you'd learn more

252
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,791
if you start out
as a spectator first?

of you do this thing!

That's okay, though.

This'll be the perfect
opportunity to learn

from someone
who's better than me.

00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,750
Sounds great, huh?

320
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:26,666
[sighs]

321
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,833
[SHIGURE yells]

322
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,375
I'd rather you not
show love with violence.

323
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,458
Thanks, though!

324
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,416
I saved one for you!

325
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,625
[ERUNA] Why did you
choose a bikini pic?!

326
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,625
[ERUNA growls]

327
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,416
It's great. Yeah!

328
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,458
I love how my little
Eruna is growing up!

329
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,208
[SHIGURE yells]

330
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,083
Gross.

331
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,458
[MINATOGAWA]
Let me have it.

332
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,750
A crane.

333
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,625
[ERUNA]
Well, that's awkward.

334
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,083
[MINATOGAWA]
It's about time to fly away.

335
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,666
Flap, flap, flap, flap.

336
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,166
[ERUNA]
Like real awkward.

337
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,666
[DEVICE] One minute
until the match begins.

338
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,083
Fifty-eight.
Fifty-seven. Fifty-six...

339
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:05,916
Seisa's here.

340
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,958
[counting continues]

341
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,625
How's it going?

342
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,416
Are you about ready
to start the battle?

343
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,083
Am I ready to officially
join the going-home club?

344
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,750
Heck yeah! Duh!

345
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,416
[SEISA]
That's not what I meant.

346
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,458
I was asking if you
are ready to lose.

347
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,500
Lose and not be in a club again.

348
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:37,708
Unfortunately, I don't prepare
for negativity and bad stuff.

349
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,750
I know that's a lot of
negative words, but still!

350
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,916
[DEVICE]
Five. Four.

351
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,125
Three. Two. One. Zero.

352
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,666
Begin the match.

353
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,958
Hey! Come get me!

354
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,041
[ERUNA yelling]

355
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,958
[ERUNA]
What the hell?! Is she sleeping?

356
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,750
Oh, yeah,
she's definitely sleeping!

357
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,000
She's even got a snot bubble!

358
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,458
Fine, if that's
how you're gonna be...

359
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,208
I got ya!

360
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,000
[ERUNA yells]

361
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,625
Ow! The crap?

362
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,958
Oh no! My crystal!

363
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,125
[ERUNA]
Here! Tension max...

364
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,541
...Go!

365
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:54,750
What's going on?

366
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,291
I'm sorry, Eruna.

367
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,916
[yelling]

368
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,625
Go, Killing Art.

369
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,000
Nice try, girl.

370
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,791
But what a shame.

371
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,833
And I'm back to
being a clubless loser.

372
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:38,708
[BIMII] Eruna!
You need to cheer up, ryui!

373
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,958
[ERUNA]
Ow!

374
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:43,416
Get off, I don't wanna
catch your ugly. Stop!

375
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,041
Look, I know you're
upset about the battle,

376
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,875
but you can't let the
results get you down, ryui.

377
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,333
That's not like you, anyway.

378
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,458
[ERUNA]
Hmph!

379
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,250
[ERUNA]
Milk?

380
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,416
[KUZURYU]
Hey.

381
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,708
You hiding out here
so you can have a good cry?

382
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,041
[ERUNA]
Kuzuryu!

383
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,833
[KUZURYU] Look, that would've
happened to any new student

384
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,166
in your position.

385
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,125
[ERUNA]
Is the milk, um, for me?

386
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,166
I feel like you're
trying to cheer me up.

387
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,458
Thank you.

388
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,791
But I, um...

389
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,916
I can't drink milk,
so can I maybe exchange this

390
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,125
for something that better
meets my dietary needs?

391
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:21,708
[KUZURYU, BIMII]
Huh?

392
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,250
Specifically...

393
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,750
I'm into drinks
that cost the most

394
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:28,041
because who wants to
swallow something ratchet?

395
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,416
Have you lost your mind?!

396
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,000
Milk is good for you!
It's got nutrients!

397
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,166
No one's too good for that!

398
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,083
You need your nutrients!

399
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,166
[ERUNA]
At least he didn't litter.

400
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,708
[BIMII]
That sounded mean,

401
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,041
but if you think about just
the words, it was kinda nice.

402
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,625
Listen, you need to keep in mind

403
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,625
your power is new
and isn't complete yet.

404
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,125
He's has a good point.
You are inexperienced.

405
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,041
Your ability didn't
activate properly

406
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,041
because you haven't
had much practice, ryui.

407
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,500
I get it.

408
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,750
As long as I practice,
I'll get stronger and stronger

409
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,833
until I'm the school hero again.

410
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,625
Once I've perfected
this rare and awesome power,

411
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,166
I'll be able to take
over the whole country

412
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,041
and then maybe I'll
even rule the world!

413
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,625
I love me!

414
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,541
[KUZURYU] Don't you think you're
getting a little carried away?!

415
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah!

416
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,166
All I need to do to get that
experience is join a club,

417
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,791
and then...

418
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,250
Although, I went to visit
a bunch of different clubs,

419
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:25,250
and there wasn't really one out
there that seemed to fit me.

420
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,250
Aww!

421
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,541
Dang it! This sucks!

422
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,541
If that's the case,
have you ever thought about

423
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:34,000
creating your own new club
that does fit you, ryui?

424
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,625
You only need three members,

425
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,541
and it has to be
some sort of social club,

426
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,000
but as long as you
meet those standards,

427
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,750
it doesn't really
matter what kind it is.

428
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,416
for it to be accepted, ryui.

429
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,625
Fascinating idea. My own club.

430
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,583
All right! I'm gonna do it!

431
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,083
[ERUNA]
Did you hear that, Universe?

432
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,666
Eruna's makin' a new club!

433
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,083
Not to burst your bubble,

434
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,125
but it'll be hard finding
members this time of year.

435
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,875
You also just
lost a practice match,

436
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,458
which isn't a
great sell, either, ryui.

437
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,125
Boo, and there's
the point system, too.

438
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,500
No one's gonna
want to join a club

439
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,583
started by a student
as weak as me.

440
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,666
Look, if you want
to change peoples' minds,

441
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,958
start by fighting
in the rookie battle.

442
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:11,916
[ERUNA]
You think so?

443
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,416
[BIMII]
Ryui.

444
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,958
If you get good results there,
you'll get more attention.

445
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,291
The way I see it,

446
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,000
you could get at least two
club members that way.

447
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,625
[ERUNA]
I like it!

448
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,958
But I refuse to settle
for something uninspired

449
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,250
and just good!

450
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,500
I'm gonna get
first place or nothing!

451
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,250
Hey, thanks a lot, Bimii!

452
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,625
Oh, you too,

453
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:31,583
well-meaning-if-not
scary-as-hell-paint-covered-guy!

454
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,208
[BIMII]
Ryui! Where are you going?

455
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,333
[KUZURYU]
What are you talking about?

456
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,291
I'm not scary at all!

457
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,458
[water splashing]

458
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,958
[ERUNA]
Hey, Seisa!

459
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,375
I wanted to tell you something!

460
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:29,541
I've decided to
make my very own club!

461
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:33,041
I know that I like lost
pretty embarrassingly today.

462
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,666
But when I get to
be the representative

463
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,708
of a club that really gets me,

464
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,208
I wanna fight you again.

465
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,041
I hope that you'll give me
another chance to prove myself!

466
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,791
I promise not to lose next time!

467
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,125
I know it won't be easy.

468
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,708
In fact, I've decided
that the best way

469
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,750
for me to get new club members
is to win the rookie battle!

470
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,958
[ERUNA]
So please, will you watch me?

471
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,750
I swear you won't regret it.

472
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,458
You'll be able
to see moves like this, yah!

473
00:21:56,541 --> 00:22:00,500
and that, ha!
And one of these, kazam!

474
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,625
[ERUNA]
That oughta convince her.

475
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,041
[ERUNA]
I did it!

476
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,791
[giggles]
My new room is ready!

477
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,416
[ERUNA]
What are you doing, Seisa?

478
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,666
What do you think?

479
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,166
I can't let you
spend the night in this.

480
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,458
However, you're staying in the
hallway in your sleeping bag.

481
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,541
[ERUNA]
Thank you!

482
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:44,833
Success!

483
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,208
[ERUNA]
Seisa's Killing Art was amazing!

484
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,833
But it was so fast,
I couldn't actually tell

485
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,666
what kind of technique it was!

486
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,416
[SHIGURE] Then let's check
using the video I shot

487
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,166
with my high-speed camera!

488
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,166
[ERUNA]
You have one of those?!

489
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,625
I wanna see! I wanna see!

490
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:31,708
[SHIGURE]
Okay, here we go! Click!

491
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:35,083
[ERUNA] Oh, look! It's Seisa
moving in super-slow motion!

492
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,583
No, wait. It's you taking
off your clothes, Shigure!

493
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:38,625
Grody!

494
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,125
[SHIGURE]
Oh no! My bad.

495
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:41,916
This was the high-speed
footage of something else

496
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,666
that I, uh,
well.. never mind!

497
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,125
[YUTO]
Never mind indeed.

498
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:46,875
Ichinomiya, is this
really the best way

499
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:48,833
to do the next episode previews?

500
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:51,375
Shouldn't you be taking
them more seriously?

501
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:52,833
[ERUNA]
Akama, you're too laid-back!

502
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:54,666
How are we gonna get people
to watch the next episode

503
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,041
if they're falling asleep?

504
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,541
[YUTO]
Hey, I'm perfectly normal.

505
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:00,041
You're the one who's letting
her ADHD take over.

506
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,500
[ERUNA] Um, FYI,
ADHD is where it's at.

507
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:04,541
Come on, Akama!
Find your inner awesome!

508
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:05,875
[SHIGURE]
I'll get into it, Eruna!

509
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:09,083
I'll get so into it,
I'm gonna lose all control!

510
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:11,583
[YUTO] Next time,
"Apathetic Coup d'Etat."

511
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:13,541
I dunno.
Maybe I should try getting

512
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,291
a little more hyperactive.
