I wonder if this
is the right way.

Wanna tell me what you think?

162
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,250
Fujishiro thinks she is not
going to work with you.

163
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,583
Fuji's only doing this hunt

164
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,791
because she has to
for her student record.

165
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,958
Well, I, for one, am happy
we're on the same team.

166

If anything, we'll at least get
the chance to talk some more.

[OTONE gasps]

168
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:25,041
Ridiculous! Fujishiro has no
interest in the likes of you.

169
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,916
Then, let me re-introduce
myself to re-interest you!

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,958
Born in New York and raised in
London, I'm Eruna Ichinomiya!

171
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,208
In sweetness, I'm as fat
as seven Tsugaru apples.

172
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,583
And right now, I'm
shacking up with

173
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,625
Seisa Mikagura from
the going-home club.

174

[OTONE]
Seisa?

175
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,500
Oh! You mean the girl who has
the ability to reshape space

176
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,125
whenever she feels like it?

177
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,583
I don't understand your words.

178
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,708
Fujishiro saw Seisa do it once.

179
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,916
Remember the other night

180
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,500
when it was raining
like really, really hard

181
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,875
and then, out of the blue,
the sky completely cleared up?

182
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,750
What? You mean that was Seisa?

183
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:59,750
How sweet! Oh, of course, she
would go out of her way for us.

we can cook it for our dinner!

I am Mecha Bimii, mecha.

195
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,250
I was sent here to liven
up the treasure hunt

for the new students
who are participating.

Hey, if you want me to,

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,416
I can guide you to
the first checkpoint.

199

Nice, you're already
more reliable than Bimii!

What's up, Eruna?

I welcome you to the
very first checkpoint.

A mental challenge,
are you kidding?

Not at all, and if you
can't pass it, you're out.

205

Don't expect Fuji to help
you answer anything.

206

[YUTO] All right, let the

[ERUNA]

Here we go!

209
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,708
Question One: when Super
Miracle Man transforms,

00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,791
what does he always eat?

211

--[bell rings]
--Stick candy is correct!

Question Two:

215
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,250
at Mount Fuji's Sea of Trees?

Oh! What a brilliant
mind, mecha!

As you can see, hopefully,

232
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,500
the third checkpoint
is a vision test.

from the cow this morning.

The treasure chest at the goal

isn't too much
farther from here.

we should have another party.

00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,458
we should come out somewhere
close to Buenos Aires, mecha!

314
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,708
How sweet, but I wish
you were actually helpful.

315
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,958
If only some pretty
princess in shining armor

316
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,958
would show up and pull off
a daring rescue.

--[leaves rustle]
--Huh?

318

Ow, that smarty smarts!

322
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,375
Fuji likes to go for
walks in this région.

323
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,291
But, more importantly, what
are you doing in such a place?

324
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,708
I wasn't paying attention
and fell down from up there.

325
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,250
Managed to hurt my leg, too.

326

Am I not the most adorable screw
up you've ever met or what?

[ERUNA] Cute! I can't take
how cute this house is.

--Yeah?
--Great show, but this is where

335

Fujishiro comes to cry.

336
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,666
Or rather, it's where
Fujishiro comes to

337
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,333
plan out her world conquest.

338
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,875
Aha! I get it, now.

339
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,625
Nobody knew who you were or
noticed you were around until

340
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,166
the rookie battle because you
were out here the whole time.

341
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,000
It's a secret, so please
don't say anything.

342
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,125
If word got out, my school
record might suffer.

343
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,291
I am known as
Mecha Bimii, mecha.

344

[ERUNA] But even if he was the
real Bimii, it wouldn't matter.

You know how to
make pain precious!

350
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,708
I never dreamed there
would be a pretty girl

351
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,583
in the 21st century who
would burn her hand and

352
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,000
then put said hand to her ear
in an act of coy brilliance!

353
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,458
Um... Did you fall on
your head or something?

354
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:54,458
[gasps] Maybe letting Eruna
in here was a grosse erreur.

[OTONE]
Anyhow, it is l'heure du thé.

356
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,833
[gasps] You can drink from
the faucet outside, though.

357
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,000
Mecha! This is how you
treat me once you find out

358
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,291
I don't have the power to
affect your record, mecha?

359
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:14,000
If this place is for one person,
why is there two of stuff?

360
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,666
Two cups and two chairs
and two coasters.

361
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,875
Even the pancakes
come in a pair.

362

Huh?

363

That's not true at all!

364

you'd think I'd been sad,

spending l'heure du thé
by myself all the time,

366
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:28,875
as if I was imagining someone
else was here to talk to!

367
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,208
Hey, so, Otone? [giggles]

368

 I don't mind helping you!

You can't serve fish

Fine, then I'll
knead the udon dough.

Are you confusing it with miso?

385

No, and Fuji thinks
putting miso in there

386
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,333
would be a lot weirder.

It has a milder taste but still
manages full-bodied flavor.

390

This is the best miso soup
I've had in my entire life!

It's not miso soup, you twit!

Cool, so like KGB alphabet soup!

No, and you owe Russia
a big apology!

spies, secret missions, and
obsessive sister countries.

[All laugh]

471
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,375
[YUTO]
You did well too, Otone.

472
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,958
[OTONE gasps]

473
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,250
Yeah, I wouldn't have been able
to make it back without Otone!

474
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,500
[gasps]

475
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,541
I've heard a lot about
you from the flowers.

476
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,083
Thank you for always taking
special care of them.

477
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,041
Oh, so you like flowers?

478
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,666
Uh... No...

479
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,833
Fuji, um... I...

480
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,958
That is, it's time for
Fujishiro to go hang out

481
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,291
with the hooligans in town

482
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,250
and cause big trouble
for all the innocent folk.

483
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,041
[whimpers]

484
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:41,916
[OTONE sobbing]

485
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I don't understand why
I have such a hard time

486
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,500
opening up to other people.

487
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,083
[ERUNA]
Otone!

488
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,000
[OTONE]
What?

489
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,750
Oh, wonderful. It's you again?

490
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,375
[ERUNA] I still haven't gotten
a chance to thank you properly.

491
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,083
Fuji can do without your thanks.

492
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,500
I knew you'd say that,
but thank you anyway.

493
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,583
I had a blast doing the
treasure hunt with you.

494
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,625
Yeah, not that we actually
managed to hunt down

495
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:01,458
any treasure, though.

496
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,333
--I sure did.
--Huh?

497
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:04,875
I found a great treasure.

498
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,291
Lucky me, huh?

499
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:12,041
Otone, whaddaya say
you and I form a new club?

500
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,625
[ERUNA] Honestly, I'm not even
sure about the concept, yet.

501
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,541
But you gotta admit the
two of us could put together

502
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,791
a pretty spectacular
club, right?

503
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,458
Since you insist, yes.

504
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:32,208
Let's face it, there's really
no reason for me not to join.

505
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,791
[ERUNA giggles]

506
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,875
[ERUNA]
We're finally friends, Otone!

507
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,166
Ooh, lightbulb.
Let's form a new club!

508
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,916
[OTONE] Um, how 'bout
you not flatter yourself

509
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,500
just because you drank
Russian tea with Fujishiro?

510
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,708
[ERUNA laughs]
There she is, Dark Otone!

511
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,125
I love it when you go Dark.

512
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,833
Okay, now try
being... Red Otone!

513
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:36,541
[OTONE]
There is no such... Fujishiro!

514
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,625
[ERUNA]
Nice! Very hot-blooded!

515
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,708
Next, I'm thinking
you should do Yellow.

516
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:42,291
[OTONE]
Well, I do like curry...

517
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,583
[ERUNA]
You're really playing along?

518
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,500
Ooh! Then, it's time
for the big one: Pink!

519
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:47,583
[OTONE] Could you maybe
not get carried away?

520
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:49,166
[ERUNA]
And we're back to Black.

521
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,708
[MECHA BIMII] Enough of
the idle chatter, you two.

522
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,916
Just do the preview
already, mecha.

523
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
[ERUNA]
Mecha Bimii, you survived!

524
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:58,333
[MECHA BIMII]
Next time, "Derailed Scandal."

525
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:03,000
Bimii's terrible, sad secret
finally comes to light, mecha.
