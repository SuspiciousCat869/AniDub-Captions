1
00:00:02,452 --> 00:00:03,702
Thank you for the help, children.

2
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:05,373
I really appreciate it.

3
00:00:06,244 --> 00:00:07,911
You may have more hands than the rest of us,

4
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:11,107
but it'd still be a stretch for you to
carry all this lab equipment by yourself.

5
00:00:11,952 --> 00:00:14,348
Exactly. Now, it's a one-trip job!

6
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:17,843
No wonder you were both elected class officers.

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,232
So reliable!

8
00:00:19,364 --> 00:00:21,989
Thanks, but you really could've done this without us.

9
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:23,527
Couple of quick trips back and forth.

10
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:25,244
I supposed I could've, yes.

11
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:26,949
But the more the merrier, eh?

12
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:28,383
I have a question, sir.

13
00:00:28,577 --> 00:00:29,038
Yes?

14
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,710
Are you starting to feel at home?

15
00:00:30,786 --> 00:00:31,897
Like, with all of us?

16
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,588
Wow. I can't believe you're really asking him that.

17
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:38,960
Put in those terms, I'd say I feel
incredibly at home as your teacher.

18
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:40,230
That's strange.

19
00:00:41,036 --> 00:00:41,618
Really?

20
00:00:42,488 --> 00:00:43,214
Well, yeah.

21
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:45,927
A creature like you taking any interest whatsoever

22
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:49,223
in a group of junior high kids isn't
exactly something you see every day.

23
00:00:49,293 --> 00:00:51,930
I mean, you actually teach us, so it's borderline cool.

24
00:00:52,077 --> 00:00:52,994
Just takes getting used to.

25
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:54,386
Yeah, no kidding.

26
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:59,718
Then there's the whole assassination thing.

27
00:01:01,964 --> 00:01:03,998
A vital part of my role, I'd argue.

28
00:01:04,202 --> 00:01:06,550
Target, teacher. We ought not separate the two.

29
00:01:09,257 --> 00:01:12,660
Did he seriously just dodge
three knives while prepping lab?

30
00:01:13,144 --> 00:01:14,559
Hey, Maehara. You okay?

31
00:01:14,994 --> 00:01:15,726
Eh.

32
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:19,786
They should know by now that
was too obvious. Am I right, Teach?

33
00:01:19,908 --> 00:01:22,290
All right, boys and girls, let's begin!

34
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,105
Whoa! It's bright red!

35
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:09,368
Ta-da!

36
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:12,593
And that's how we extract the
coloring from processed foods.

37
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:15,230
I'll, uh...

38
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:17,734
I'll just take the leftover samples, thank you.

39
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:18,655
Excuse me.

40
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:21,928
Wait! We bought those for ourselves!

41
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:26,511
Is it me, or did he just use this lab to
support his junk-food habit between paychecks?

42
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:30,563
My question's why a super organism has to
live on a teacher's salary in the first place.

43
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:32,639
Eh?

44
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:35,172
I, uh...

45
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:36,895
Well, uh...

46
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:39,105
Go on, speak up, Okuda.

47
00:03:39,244 --> 00:03:40,295
What can I do for you?

48
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:41,456
Umm!

49
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:45,985
Poison, sir! Would you drink it, please?!

50
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:48,980
Well, she doesn't beat around the bush.

51
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,419
I'm sorry. Is this weird?

52
00:03:51,762 --> 00:03:55,741
It's certainly a very straightforward
assassination attempt, I'll give you that.

53
00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:02,693
See, the thing is, sir, I'm not very good at being
sneaky. I mean, everyone else is so good at this stuff.

54
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,954
But, me? What I'm good at is chemistry!

55
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:08,278
And I put my heart and soul into this mixture!

56
00:04:08,786 --> 00:04:09,970
All righty, then.

57
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:11,742
Um, Okuda?

58
00:04:12,089 --> 00:04:14,672
Points for throwing in, but no one's that stupid.

59
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:16,294
Your heart and soul?

60
00:04:16,702 --> 00:04:18,327
Don't mind if I do, then!

61
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:25,399
This-This is!

62
00:04:25,911 --> 00:04:27,266
Is it really gonna work?

63
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:28,729
This might be it!

64
00:04:34,116 --> 00:04:35,577
Or he could just grew horns.

65
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:36,624
Quite a kick.

66
00:04:36,678 --> 00:04:40,184
Sodium hydroxide, I believe? Good try, Miss Okuda.

67
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:42,727
If I were human, I'd most definitely have bought the farm.

68
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:44,060
Oh, I see.

69
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:46,477
Shall I try the other two we have here as well?

70
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:47,366
Yes, please!

71
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:49,153
Right! Down the hatch!

72
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:00,839
He grew wings this time?!

73
00:05:00,977 --> 00:05:03,177
Wow, he's starting to look kinda fancy.

74
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,616
Thallium acetate. Interesting.

75
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:07,478
Let's see what the last one does.

76
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:12,539
Uh-oh!

77
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:14,420
Not sure I wanna see this!

78
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:19,798
That's boring.

79
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:21,921
This just keeps getting weirder and weirder.

80
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:24,384
I don't like this look. It's creeping me out.

81
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:26,560
So poison turns him into an emoticon?

82
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:28,446
If you hate me, I understand.

83
00:05:28,577 --> 00:05:30,744
But please, don't hate assassination.

84
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:32,416
What's that even supposed to mean?!

85
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:35,468
Also, young lady. As your teacher,

86
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:39,803
I can't overlook the fact that you
handled toxic substances unsupervised.

87
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:42,419
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

88
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:44,832
Don't worry. I have an idea.

89
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:48,455
Why don't we work together on a poison
that has a little bit more of a kick?

90
00:05:48,562 --> 00:05:50,528
Uh, sure!

91
00:05:50,748 --> 00:05:53,915
Doesn't seem like that's gonna
end in success if you ask me.

92
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:56,043
Might get some good notes out of it at least.

93
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:02,732
Heads up!

94
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,091
I got it!

95
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:05,042
Yeah!

96
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:06,744
All right, that's what I'm talking about!

97
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:10,463
Hey there, big boy. How's tricks?

98
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:13,681
It's an absolute sauna in here.

99
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:16,803
Ugh. Aren't you on fire?

100
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:18,764
That's not the word I would use, no.

101
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:22,163
Look, save this act for the target. Back off.

102
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,525
Ugh, I swear, you're such a killjoy.

103
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:27,194
If you're gonna cut it here
as a teacher, pull it together.

104
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:28,869
I thought we had discussed this.

105
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:30,702
For your information, it's not an act.

106
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:32,280
It's hotter than hell in this dump.

107
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,759
How do they expect these kids to function without AC?

108
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:38,379
I've tried to put in several requests for renovations,

109
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:40,369
but the funds aren't there. Or so I'm told.

110
00:06:40,452 --> 00:06:41,258
Seriously?

111
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,612
Damn it!

112
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:43,499
Everyone saw, right?

113
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:44,761
That was a clean hit!

114
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:47,343
Can't be helped. It's how things are here.

115
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:49,727
Okey-dokey.

116
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:52,053
We're ready to add it to the ethanol, I think.

117
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:55,192
Now, be extra careful. Don't breathe in the fumes.

118
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:56,026
Got it!

119
00:06:56,366 --> 00:07:00,635
It's a shame your enthusiasm for
chemistry doesn't extend to other subjects.

120
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:03,575
Heh. Everything else seems to go over my head.

121
00:07:03,786 --> 00:07:06,347
Especially when it comes to language arts and stuff.

122
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:08,786
That's why I'm here, I guess.

123
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,840
I never know the right thing to say.

124
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:14,602
The words don't come out or I get 'em all turned around.

125
00:07:15,327 --> 00:07:17,597
Tell me to express myself and I seize up.

126
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:18,647
Hmm...

127
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,532
It's okay. I don't mind so much.

128
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:25,952
At least with math and science,
there's always a right answer.

129
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:27,760
Everything's spelled out for you.

130
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,403
They're concise.

131
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,773
No double meanings, no weird feels.

132
00:07:31,872 --> 00:07:34,289
No worrying that someone'll take your words the wrong way.

133
00:07:34,464 --> 00:07:35,934
It makes perfect sense.

134
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,792
I see the appeal.

135
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:39,176
Tell you what, Okuda.

136
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:42,020
I have a special homework assignment just for you.

137
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:46,374
Remember, though. Safety first.

138
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:52,071
Um...

139
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:55,582
Okay, so he really asked you to bring the poison to class?

140
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:59,928
Yeah! He said the stuff in this
flask should work like a charm!

141
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:04,861
He even drew a manga of the safety guidelines
for proper use and storage. I'm impressed.

142
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:06,657
Going the extra mile yet again.

143
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:08,713
I know he's unconventional and all,

144
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:11,626
but giving us the goods on a poison that'll kill him?

145
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:13,010
Nice, right?

146
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:15,148
I think it's his way of encouraging me.

147
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:17,707
I'm good at chemistry, not words.

148
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:19,804
He says to focus on my strengths!

149
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:22,452
Good morning, everyone.

150
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,386
Here's your chance. Go give it to him!

151
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:25,869
Here it is, sir.

152
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:26,952
Just like you asked.

153
00:08:27,036 --> 00:08:28,227
Ah! Nice work.

154
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:30,196
Well, here's to your health, children.

155
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:30,927
Salud!

156
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:42,176
Thank you, Okuda.

157
00:08:43,331 --> 00:08:45,119
Thank you very much indeed.

158
00:08:45,213 --> 00:08:48,605
This concoction is precisely what I needed to level up.

159
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,043
Wait, you... I don't...

160
00:08:58,313 --> 00:08:58,837
Pyuu.

161
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:01,205
He melted?!

162
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,454
You didn't think that was a poison, did you?

163
00:09:03,498 --> 00:09:08,594
On the contrary. I had you whip up a
special tonic designed to increase my fluidity.

164
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:14,753
In liquid form, I fit comfortably
into the tightest nooks and crannies.

165
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:16,586
What are you doing in there?

166
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:19,376
Best of all, I lose none of my speed!

167
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:20,991
Go ahead! Try to beat me! Come on!

168
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:22,202
This is messed up, dude!

169
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:23,817
What in the world did you give him?!

170
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:26,447
You tricked me! That's not fair!

171
00:09:26,577 --> 00:09:28,265
Hmm... Fair?

172
00:09:28,462 --> 00:09:32,302
Verbal deception is a vital part
of the successful assassin's toolkit.

173
00:09:32,327 --> 00:09:32,810
Huh?

174
00:09:33,245 --> 00:09:34,883
What are you talking about, sir?

175
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:39,197
Approaching the target so naively
is a good way to fail in your mission.

176
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:43,895
Even the deadliest of poisons is useless
if one can't persuade the mark to drink it.

177
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,451
Nagisa. Say you wanted to poison me.

178
00:09:46,614 --> 00:09:47,993
How might you go about it?

179
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:49,836
Huh? Well, lemme think.

180
00:09:50,254 --> 00:09:52,243
I'd probably put it in something you liked.

181
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,280
For you!

182
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:54,116
For me?

183
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:56,198
Then I guess I would offer it to you as a gift.

184
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:58,305
Excellent.

185
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:01,396
You see, to deceive someone you
have to get inside their heads;

186
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:04,542
know what they respond to. Use language creatively.

187
00:10:04,998 --> 00:10:09,563
In poisoning, as in life, the
key to success is communication.

188
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:14,952
Imagine that one day, you make an
Earth-shattering scientific discovery.

189
00:10:15,036 --> 00:10:18,326
How can it benefit mankind if
it stays locked inside your head?

190
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:22,044
Knowing the right thing so say
can make all the difference, right?

191
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:25,702
Right! Thank you, sir!

192
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:30,327
Nice move, Teach. Turn the tables, huh?

193
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:31,221
No kidding.

194
00:10:31,952 --> 00:10:33,691
Leave it to Koro-sensei.

195
00:10:34,036 --> 00:10:37,286
To him, even a student trying to poison him is still,

196
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,803
first and foremost, a student.

197
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,226
We're a long way off from being able to kill him.

198
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,861
He's just that good.

199
00:10:56,994 --> 00:10:58,286
Quit dragging your feet.

200
00:10:58,369 --> 00:11:02,036
We show up late again, there's no telling
what kind of messed up stuff they'll make us do.

201
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,014
Yeah. Last time we had to clean out the flower beds.

202
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:07,141
Heh. Man, that blew.

203
00:11:07,286 --> 00:11:09,369
Those friggin' things are the size of a house.

204
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:10,411
What are you bitching about?

205
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:11,685
We did all the work.

206
00:11:13,264 --> 00:11:14,663
I was moral support!

207
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:15,827
This sucks!

208
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,323
Somebody explain to me why
we're the only students in school

209
00:11:18,348 --> 00:11:20,432
who have to put up with this crap!

210
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,202
Surprise!

211
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:24,927
Hey! Is that Kunudon?

212
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,233
Hello! It's me, Kunudon!

213
00:11:27,258 --> 00:11:28,452
Hooray!

214
00:11:28,536 --> 00:11:31,119
Today, we're going to talk about underachievers!

215
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:34,091
Here, we like to give them a special place all their own!

216
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:37,887
A place called E Class, where they
won't bother the good boys and girls!

217
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:40,786
Wow! What a great idea!

218
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:43,286
Now we don't normally like it when E Class students

219
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,494
set foot on the main campus. But we do make exceptions

220
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:48,411
for school assemblies, when we invite them

221
00:11:48,494 --> 00:11:50,789
to take a stroll down the mountain on their lunch break.

222
00:11:52,657 --> 00:11:54,786
Ahh! The stupid bridge is out!

223
00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:55,913
No way!

224
00:11:55,938 --> 00:11:58,344
Who's the genius who told us this was a shortcut?!

225
00:11:58,606 --> 00:12:00,439
Okajima!

226
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:03,994
Discipline is key! 'Specially for E Class slobs.

227
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:09,215
And nothing instills discipline like lining up
inside the gymnasium for special assemblies, kids!

228
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,439
Discipline!

229
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:12,822
Why are there snakes?!

230
00:12:13,277 --> 00:12:14,750
Look out, Okajima!

231
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,763
Come on, maggots, get in gear!

232
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:20,026
Give me a "sir, yes sir!" Now!

233
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:22,546
Sir, yes, sir! Hooray!

234
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,566
Why are there falling boulders?!

235
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,976
Oh! Crap! Look out, Okajima!

236
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:32,150
Whose big idea was it to poke the beehive?!

237
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:35,145
Look out, Okajima!

238
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:38,308
He's, uh, not having a very good day, is he?

239
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:40,286
Hope the poor guy's all right.

240
00:12:40,616 --> 00:12:41,381
Me, too.

241
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:45,077
Ugh. Can we be done with the rocks

242
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:47,786
and the bees and the things trying to kill us, please?

243
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:50,702
I'm glad Okajima was around
to take the brunt of it for us.

244
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:52,077
Hey. Anyone hurt?

245
00:12:52,153 --> 00:12:53,643
I think we're mostly okay.

246
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:55,111
Good. No rush.

247
00:12:55,463 --> 00:12:57,668
In fact, at this rate, we're making fairly excellent time.

248
00:12:57,702 --> 00:12:59,665
Wait for me!

249
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:02,036
Way to ditch me, jerks!

250
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:03,614
Hey! Professor Bitch!

251
00:13:06,004 --> 00:13:09,152
No one said anything about a class trip during lunch.

252
00:13:09,244 --> 00:13:11,598
Yeah, no offense, Professor, but you look wrecked.

253
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:13,677
You try running through nature in heels!

254
00:13:13,744 --> 00:13:16,373
Mr. Karasuma? Where's Koro-sensei?

255
00:13:16,683 --> 00:13:19,686
We told him to wait back at the
old campus for security reasons.

256
00:13:19,787 --> 00:13:21,703
It wouldn't do for the other students to see him.

257
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:25,351
I'm all alone. A shunned Sensei.

258
00:13:26,244 --> 00:13:29,244
Well. The main campus isn't much further away.

259
00:13:29,307 --> 00:13:30,202
Are you ready?

260
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:31,261
Yeah...

261
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:44,006
That sincerely sucked.

262
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:45,824
Well, at least we're not late.

263
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,646
No idea how that happened.

264
00:13:47,738 --> 00:13:48,737
Hurry up, people!

265
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,652
We've got to get in line before they start!

266
00:13:50,768 --> 00:13:52,064
Okay.

267
00:14:00,903 --> 00:14:03,153
Hey, Nagisa!

268
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:03,717
Uh?

269
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:05,452
Wow, look at you guys!

270
00:14:05,536 --> 00:14:06,822
I'm surprised you made it!

271
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,975
Must've been a heck of a trek rollin' down the mountain!

272
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:13,739
Once a month, there's an all-school assembly.

273
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:17,291
And even here we get treated like the lowest of the low.

274
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:19,452
Not something we look forward to,

275
00:14:19,536 --> 00:14:21,462
but... not a lot we can do about it, either.

276
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:24,226
You are the cream of the crop.

277
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,952
This nation's shining elite. Never forget that.

278
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:29,907
I am proud to be your dean.

279
00:14:30,206 --> 00:14:30,804
But!

280
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:32,513
Don't get too comfortable.

281
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:36,248
No. Let E Class remind us of the perils in that.

282
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:42,552
Now, now! It's unkind to laugh at their expense!

283
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:45,653
Hey, Nagisa. Why isn't Karma here?

284
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:46,964
Because he's ditching.

285
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:47,417
What?

286
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,530
Is he out of his mind?!

287
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,584
It's not like he doesn't know he'll catch hell
for blowing off assembly, he just doesn't care.

288
00:14:54,738 --> 00:14:56,849
Wish I had the grades to get away with that.

289
00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:58,739
They'd probably just throw me out.

290
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:00,415
Yeah, ain't that the truth.

291
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:04,935
If I may say so, sir,

292
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,127
this method is remarkably effective!

293
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:09,552
It shows in the percentage of students from our academy

294
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:13,386
who go on to top universities. E Class aside, of course.

295
00:15:13,469 --> 00:15:15,242
We are pragmatists here.

296
00:15:15,806 --> 00:15:20,667
Realists. Young people must be
prepared for the world as it is.

297
00:15:21,702 --> 00:15:27,421
Sadly, the best way to ignite their potential
is to let them see it extinguished in others.

298
00:15:27,952 --> 00:15:29,244
Very sound reasoning.

299
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:30,774
Yes, of course it is.

300
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:33,991
Whether in school administration or assassination,

301
00:15:34,452 --> 00:15:37,304
I pride myself on adherence to logic.

302
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,428
Now we'll have an address by the student council.

303
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:42,675
Student council members, come up to the podium, please.

304
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,526
Who's that?

305
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:44,748
Never seen him before.

306
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:46,759
He looks way too cool to be a teacher!

307
00:15:46,784 --> 00:15:48,585
I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce myself.

308
00:15:49,202 --> 00:15:50,089
Oh. Hello.

309
00:15:50,114 --> 00:15:50,859
You too?

310
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:53,077
Wow! Cool!

311
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:53,734
Yeah.

312
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:56,577
Hey. Check it, Mister K.

313
00:15:56,701 --> 00:15:59,159
We decorated the thing we keep our knives in!

314
00:15:59,261 --> 00:16:00,288
So stylish.

315
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:03,378
They're "totes adorable," yes! Now put them away!

316
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:05,348
We're supposed to keep this on the DL.

317
00:16:05,493 --> 00:16:07,001
The other students can't know!

318
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:08,629
Oh, sorry.

319
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:10,625
I think he's the new E Class teacher.

320
00:16:11,098 --> 00:16:13,239
Looks like he's big on the hands-on approach.

321
00:16:13,382 --> 00:16:16,186
No fair. Why can't the regular teachers be that hot?

322
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:18,181
I mean, seriously, is there some kind of rule?

323
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:32,521
Whoa! Who's the boobalicious foreign-looking chick?!

324
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,036
Five minutes ago she was down on all fours,

325
00:16:36,087 --> 00:16:37,583
but damn, look at 'er work it!

326
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,381
Slow down. I'm dying!

327
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:45,582
Quick recovery, huh?

328
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,077
Don't tell me she's an E Class teacher, too?

329
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:50,674
So jealous...

330
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:53,494
What are you doing here?

331
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:55,369
Don't even try to pull rank on me.

332
00:16:55,452 --> 00:16:57,119
I'm an educator just like you are.

333
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,052
So you're finally embracing your role?

334
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:02,027
Or, I just need an excuse to scope out the student body.

335
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:05,778
Me-ow. Said nobody ever.

336
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:07,247
Oh. That's right.

337
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,521
Nagisa. The octopus isn't around. Talk to me.

338
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:17,286
Gimme some Intel. You're still keeping a record of
all the ooey-gooey bastard's vulnerable points, right?

339
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:20,219
Let teacher peek at your notebook
and I'll make it worth your while.

340
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:24,411
Uh. I, uh, haven't added anything
to it since the last time you looked.

341
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,327
Please, sweetheart. You and I both know you're
keeping the good stuff all to your lonesome.

342
00:17:28,411 --> 00:17:29,327
Actually, I've shared every...

343
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:31,036
Ugh. Come on now, kid.

344
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,161
Dish. Or I'll smother you.

345
00:17:33,515 --> 00:17:37,216
Stop it, Professor Bitch! I can't
breathe through your enormous ta-tas!

346
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:39,369
What a teacher.

347
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:41,490
What a... bitch.

348
00:17:41,988 --> 00:17:44,000
What the hell? Are you kidding me?

349
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:46,994
The End Class douche bags aren't
supposed to get any special perks!

350
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:47,891
Oww!

351
00:17:49,071 --> 00:17:53,821
Okay. All the upcoming student council events
are detailed in the handouts you've just been given.

352
00:17:54,222 --> 00:17:57,528
Uh. Hang on. How come we didn't get any?

353
00:17:58,731 --> 00:18:00,241
Uh, excuse me, sir?

354
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:02,136
E Class didn't get the handouts.

355
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:05,594
Oh. Wow, really? That's kind of bizarre.

356
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:09,911
Huh. I'm so sorry. I thought for
sure we printed enough for everyone!

357
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:13,778
Guess E Class will just have to
memorize it off their neighbors'.

358
00:18:14,788 --> 00:18:16,369
That works out for the best, really.

359
00:18:16,452 --> 00:18:19,691
I mean, you people could use
the mental exercise I'm guessing.

360
00:18:20,326 --> 00:18:22,784
What a little prick. Somebody ought to...

361
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,987
There you go, Isogai.

362
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:31,685
Seriously?!

363
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:33,681
That should take care of it, I think.

364
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:36,700
All of you have a copy of the handout now, correct?

365
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:38,337
Yes, Sir!

366
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:41,784
Never mind. We have some. My mistake, sorry.

367
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:44,500
You what?! But, I... How did you...

368
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,616
Okay, who's the wise guy? Who killed our fun?

369
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:52,057
I mean. Ahem! As I was saying before.

370
00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:55,494
Um, if you'll take a closer look at the events schedule,

371
00:18:55,577 --> 00:18:57,286
you'll notice we have quite a few things packed...

372
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,161
I thought we agreed we couldn't
let the other students see you.

373
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:02,982
What part of "state secret" do you refuse to understand?

374
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,011
Relax. My disguise is flawless.

375
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:07,582
No one suspects a thing.

376
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:09,720
Looks like somebody got a little lonely.

377
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,642
Can't say I blame the guy.

378
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:14,932
Hey. Was that teacher standing there a second ago?

379
00:19:15,052 --> 00:19:18,308
I dunno, what's with him bein' all big and, like, wriggly?

380
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:20,767
Yeah. And what's with the hot one trying to stab him?

381
00:19:21,387 --> 00:19:23,209
Is that a thing? Can she do that?

382
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:24,747
I can get him, let go!

383
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:28,648
The other one's got her in some kind of hold.

384
00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:29,777
That class is crazy.

385
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,211
Oh well. I'll say this much for her, she never quits.

386
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,883
We're gonna run on ahead, Nagisa.

387
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:42,885
Cool. I'll grab a drink and catch up with you.

388
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,905
Yo, Nagisa.

389
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:46,405
Uh?

390
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:48,749
You proud of yourselves?

391
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,195
Acting like you're havin' the time of your lives?

392
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:52,677
Laughing during assembly.

393
00:19:52,702 --> 00:19:53,403
Not cool.

394
00:19:53,618 --> 00:19:55,384
You bums ever hear of respect?

395
00:19:56,204 --> 00:19:59,036
If I was in E Class, I'd keep
my head down and my mouth shut.

396
00:19:59,061 --> 00:20:01,931
Yeah, and I sure as hell wouldn't have a reason to laugh.

397
00:20:03,272 --> 00:20:06,386
Hey. Watch it with that look, I'm warnin' ya.

398
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:07,570
Hmm?

399
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:12,464
This whole stupid system is a travesty.

400
00:20:13,736 --> 00:20:14,863
Easy does it.

401
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,850
The boy can handle himself.

402
00:20:17,277 --> 00:20:19,821
My students know how to deal with bullies.

403
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,689
Something you wanna say, scumbag?

404
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:24,731
You want me to kill your ass?!

405
00:20:27,195 --> 00:20:29,943
Kill? You're kidding, right?

406
00:20:30,684 --> 00:20:32,207
You're really gonna kill me?

407
00:20:35,094 --> 00:20:36,031
Heh.

408
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,185
Like you've got the balls to try.

409
00:20:41,295 --> 00:20:42,264
Go right ahead.

410
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:51,332
Dude, what... What was that all about?

411
00:20:52,454 --> 00:20:54,603
Damn. He's a psycho.

412
00:20:55,257 --> 00:20:56,225
What did I tell you?

413
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,402
They have more self-respect than to roll over for a bully.

414
00:20:59,689 --> 00:21:00,557
Huh...

415
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:03,907
Interesting.

416
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:08,803
An E Class reprobate presuming to shove his betters?

417
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:14,267
Hmph. What nonsense. This behavior is unacceptable.

418
00:21:14,677 --> 00:21:17,121
It would appear a few tweaks are in order.

419
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:19,758
Assassination can wait.

420
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,389
For now, my priority is the status quo.
