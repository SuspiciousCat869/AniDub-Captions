1
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:35,397
Hm?

2
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:44,895
Uh.

3
00:00:48,592 --> 00:00:49,189
Hey!

4
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,476
Hmm.

5
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:48,239
Sir!

6
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:55,548
Sir!

7
00:14:30,644 --> 00:14:31,180
Huh?

8
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,602
Hmm.

9
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:30,855
Mmm.

10
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,191
Out!

11
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,222
Out!

12
00:00:46,352 --> 00:00:46,797
Whoa!

13
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:03,060
Yeah.

14
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:52,272
Nope.

15
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:43,368
Yeah!

16
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:27,112
What?

17
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:35,782
Safe!

18
00:13:56,987 --> 00:13:57,614
Yeah!

19
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:27,439
Play!

20
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:12,439
This.

21
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,562
Ah-ha!

22
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:26,668
Karma.

23
00:00:47,978 --> 00:00:48,502
Sugino!

24
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:56,986
Strike!

25
00:08:02,085 --> 00:08:02,913
No way!

26
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:37,394
Sugino!

27
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:32,587
Strike!

28
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:56,805
No way!

29
00:17:02,326 --> 00:17:04,544
Shindo!

30
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:44,013
Strike!

31
00:20:08,213 --> 00:20:08,991
Shindo!

32
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:10,906
Uh. Nah.

33
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,680
Oh, fine.

34
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:10,746
Heads up!

35
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:03,334
Yes, sir!

36
00:20:24,228 --> 00:20:25,159
One game?

37
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,386
Heh, I am.

38
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,585
Oh. Right.

39
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:04,886
Holy crap.

40
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:53,761
Precisely!

41
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:43,917
Play ball!

42
00:10:11,222 --> 00:10:12,311
He hit it!

43
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:10,710
All right!

44
00:00:49,277 --> 00:00:50,221
'Sup, dude?

45
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:13,502
Roger that.

46
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:11,915
Sorry, man.

47
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:05,495
Damn right!

48
00:06:32,787 --> 00:06:33,621
Good advice.

49
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,861
Psst. Karma.

50
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:57,955
Well played.

51
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:30,872
Hm? Yes, sir!

52
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:21,753
Humility much?

53
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:13,067
Like, royally.

54
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:23,921
Piece of cake.

55
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:30,665
We all sucked.

56
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:40,169
Sorry, my bad.

57
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,395
Done and done!

58
00:21:11,502 --> 00:21:12,329
Just thinkin'.

59
00:07:57,627 --> 00:07:58,448
What the hell?!

60
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:50,137
Uh. What the...

61
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,040
Principal, sir.

62
00:13:16,585 --> 00:13:17,563
That's one out.

63
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,768
it was awesome.

64
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,618
Play hard today!

65
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,294
Exhibition game?

66
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,554
He's over there.

67
00:06:20,952 --> 00:06:23,239
One! Two! Three!

68
00:06:23,752 --> 00:06:26,145
One! Two! Three!

69
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:12,288
One! Two! Three!

70
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,139
One! Two! Three!

71
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,827
I can't do this!

72
00:09:37,821 --> 00:09:40,587
One! Two! Three!

73
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,953
You're not well.

74
00:13:24,478 --> 00:13:26,894
One! Two! Three!

75
00:18:06,411 --> 00:18:07,877
Wow. Duly noted.

76
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,502
Give us a break.

77
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:09,565
Somethin' wrong?

78
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:38,877
So, there's that.

79
00:07:13,585 --> 00:07:15,037
Let's go! Hit me!

80
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:20,750
of dopplegängers!

81
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:40,166
It's complicated!

82
00:15:40,744 --> 00:15:41,301
What do you care?

83
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,217
We have a double!

84
00:17:31,157 --> 00:17:32,929
Ah. I get it now.

85
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,030
Heads up, Nagisa!

86
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:51,368
It was... well...

87
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,621
first base is his.

88
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,336
This is messed up!

89
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:29,966
Hashimoto, a word.

90
00:20:34,654 --> 00:20:35,717
Take a look at us.

91
00:00:46,957 --> 00:00:47,954
Check it out, guys!

92
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,745
It's not even fair.

93
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,932
I don't believe it!

94
00:12:08,006 --> 00:12:09,285
Batter number five:

95
00:16:34,723 --> 00:16:35,973
A-ho! Lookie there!

96
00:01:12,544 --> 00:01:14,000
Hey, c'mon. Be nice.

97
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,710
Uh-oh! Nobody say...

98
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:37,061
Who saw that coming?

99
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,491
Sneaky little creep.

100
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,130
No! This isn't real!

101
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,748
Proceed as you will.

102
00:18:59,935 --> 00:19:01,183
On the next throw...

103
00:19:32,946 --> 00:19:34,544
Uh... A triple play!

104
00:00:59,544 --> 00:01:00,764
but I'd sure like to.

105
00:06:01,335 --> 00:06:02,627
Let's play some ball!

106
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,503
Right! Let's do this!

107
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,363
Okay, boys and girls.

108
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,313
A bunt! Unbelievable!

109
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,002
Ha, ha. They're good,

110
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:48,421
Sugino plans to bunt!

111
00:12:10,735 --> 00:12:11,911
Let's play some ball!

112
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:06,144
He's the baseball guy.

113
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:27,159
Not gonna lie, though.

114
00:06:19,576 --> 00:06:20,771
Oh, yeah. Real smooth.

115
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:31,762
"Kill the opposition."

116
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:47,377
Holy cow! A push bunt!

117
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:22,652
Fair ball! Astounding!

118
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:14,059
And he's popped it up!

119
00:14:06,435 --> 00:14:08,181
strengths, weaknesses.

120
00:14:38,882 --> 00:14:40,019
No worries, I'm on it.

121
00:15:46,643 --> 00:15:47,810
That's perfectly fine.

122
00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:10,985
I wanna be more active.

123
00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:26,752
Approved! Except, uh...

124
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:48,363
while everyone watches.

125
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:27,496
So, what did that mean?

126
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,535
Assassination Baseball!

127
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,476
300 kilometers an hour!

128
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:38,474
Aren't I the lucky one.

129
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,335
Come, don't be foolish.

130
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:17,650
This is highly unusual.

131
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:56,900
Let's turn this around!

132
00:16:05,526 --> 00:16:06,876
Thank you, Koro-sensei.

133
00:19:22,784 --> 00:19:24,158
Throw it to third base!

134
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:07,375
It's gonna get hot soon.

135
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:07,011
and it's been marvelous.

136
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:38,211
E Class has zero outs...

137
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,848
Wow. That was a beating.

138
00:14:53,785 --> 00:14:54,858
"They will be trampled."

139
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:55,919
"They will be trampled."

140
00:19:56,182 --> 00:19:57,463
This wasn't just a game.

141
00:00:30,803 --> 00:00:32,107
There's always the beach.

142
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,064
Hey, hey! Look who it is!

143
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,192
Long time no see, Sugino!

144
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,494
Ha. Yeah, I know. I suck.

145
00:01:08,576 --> 00:01:09,481
We've gotta hit the books.

146
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:36,293
Now guess which one I am.

147
00:05:17,544 --> 00:05:19,230
Whoa-oh! It's a high one!

148
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:50,294
At the Junior High Level,

149
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:16,419
And we have another bunt!

150
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:24,335
A little guidance, Coach!

151
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:30,871
Strike three! Batter out!

152
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:47,460
"My strength is infinite.

153
00:18:28,948 --> 00:18:30,335
Crack a skull if need be.

154
00:20:36,576 --> 00:20:37,784
We're not much of a team.

155
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:44,377
We get split up by gender,

156
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:08,057
That's not how this works!

157
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:46,784
Fastballs 90% of the time.

158
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:31,614
A rare off-day for Shindo!

159
00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:50,116
And allow me to reiterate.

160
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:49,300
but what are you gonna do?

161
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:42,391
but the winner is E Class!

162
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,278
You don't believe me? Fine.

163
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,502
Aw, c'mon. That isn't true.

164
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:10,667
Now, do as destiny demands.

165
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:18,560
Move it, kid. Get your tail.

166
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:29,236
Hiya, teach. Great disguise.

167
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,544
Runners on first and second!

168
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:33,270
Maybe he's not feeling well.

169
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:45,294
No! I'm fine! Honestly, sir!

170
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:28,408
You mean we've got nothing?!

171
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:34,269
Strike three! Batter is out!

172
00:15:41,377 --> 00:15:42,585
This isn't even a real game!

173
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,376
Good one, capt'n! Nice throw!

174
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:02,460
Man, it'd be epic if you did!

175
00:06:33,878 --> 00:06:36,378
Treat the other team like our
target and we can't go wrong.

176
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,958
Wha... What are you gonna do?

177
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:58,502
A hit! The trajectory is low.

178
00:18:16,084 --> 00:18:17,840
Talk about point blank range!

179
00:18:34,502 --> 00:18:35,960
Think you're intimidating me?

180
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:35,199
It's hard to have a tournament
with an odd number of teams.

181
00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:28,986
I'd give anything to beat him.

182
00:04:57,669 --> 00:04:59,034
but I brought a table to flip!

183
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:06,472
Same stance, same force, as if
the boy himself were throwing.

184
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,935
I know I've got nothing on the
strength of your throwing arm.

185
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:39,111
I recommend you get some rest.

186
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,160
Sugino is a formidable talent.

187
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:51,623
"I will overpower my enemies."

188
00:14:51,686 --> 00:14:53,737
"I will overpower my enemies."

189
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,252
They're bogarting the infield.

190
00:17:18,174 --> 00:17:21,291
but by the swing of a powerful
young man under my tutelage.

191
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:12,737
Sounds good. You know I'm game.

192
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:25,826
they're one of the chosen ones.

193
00:04:06,597 --> 00:04:08,574
What do you say, man? Any tips?

194
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,278
The winner of the Third Year
Baseball Tournament is A Class!

195
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,289
Oh, this is going to be a riot.

196
00:05:50,044 --> 00:05:53,012
Remember that. Victory goes to
the player with the most skill.

197
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:03,962
Whoa! Like kilometers per hour?

198
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:20,034
Ha. We'll strike out the first
three batters top of the first.

199
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:29,687
Zero outs and the bases loaded!

200
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:19,734
They're on a collision course
with each other. I can feel it.

201
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,051
If the rules haven't changed,
this little gambit ain't legal.

202
00:16:13,308 --> 00:16:17,525
Between that and genuine skill,
genuine strength, on balance,

203
00:05:07,122 --> 00:05:10,767
Whatever the odds, the name of
the game is always, "Kill! Win!"

204
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,877
Pitcher Koro throws a staggering.

205
00:10:23,848 --> 00:10:25,080
You're not seeing things, folks!

206
00:12:53,227 --> 00:12:55,206
Forge ahead to meet your future,

207
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,870
as clearing your path of debris.

208
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,818
Not unlike someone else we know.

209
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:41,367
And so the game resumes, except.

210
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,127
That's got him pretty shaken up.

211
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,909
And not just put up a good fight.

212
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,171
guaranteed to secure our victory!

213
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:10,630
So far, so good, Coach! Nice job.

214
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:48,919
He sticks with what he does best.

215
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:54,394
Ah, okay. This explain it, folks.

216
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:35,734
We must redirect the game's flow.

217
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,592
What separates you from the
common ilk is a sense of destiny.

218
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:24,024
Strike, three! The batter is out!

219
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,080
Heh. We'll hold you to that, sir.

220
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:10,342
He wants to do what the Principal
says, but can't bring himself to.

221
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:49,502
See, for me, it wasn't so much
about getting stronger or better.

222
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:05,919
The crappy weather's finally over!

223
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:20,196
Burning the candle at both
ends is a privilege of the gifted.

224
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:42,754
Yeah. It's a spectacle, basically.

225
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,960
So, for the remainder of practice,

226
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:09,351
And after dealing with the
pitches I've been hurtling at you,

227
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:38,458
What on earth is the deal with
you and your hatred of big boobs?!

228
00:11:56,002 --> 00:11:58,989
Coach Terai has been severely
ill since before the game started.

229
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:23,044
How am I s'posed to bunt my
way around a B.S. setup like this?

230
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:52,108
This is far more than just a game.

231
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,683
the two are diametrically opposed.

232
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,382
None of us can catch worth a damn.

233
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:29,877
I think it's time to put your
earlier trash talking to good use.

234
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:25,834
My, an obvious attempt at a bluff.

235
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,248
these boys are top of their class.

236
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:29,851
I note that E Class isn't
included in the tournament bracket.

237
00:04:35,656 --> 00:04:37,954
Baseball is my first love. My life.

238
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:12,919
And to reward that fighting spirit,

239
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,570
On the field, and in the classroom.

240
00:06:57,021 --> 00:07:00,002
Damn! That pitcher's throw comes
at ya like a friggin' bullet train!

241
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:42,327
Batter number two: Catcher, Shiota.

242
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,335
and imitating Shindo's form to a T.

243
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,315
Shindo's "fastballs" should seem
like they're moving in slow motion.

244
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:26,871
We just had a base-clearing triple!

245
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:30,547
What the hell's going on out there?

246
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,653
Your team will worry, and when they
worry, it undermines their playing.

247
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,184
Good work, my boy. Now, keep it up.

248
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:13,233
And yet, as molders of young minds,

249
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,661
...in the batter's box. ...Hang on.

250
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,543
Oh! Nevermind. You guys are morons.

251
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:44,252
You got a problem, go cry to momma!

252
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,588
Normally this would be distasteful.

253
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:38,516
Yo. New marching orders from Coach.

254
00:17:45,158 --> 00:17:47,919
Choking up the infield isn't
helping the batter's concentration,

255
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:56,043
Dodging Shindo's swing is as simple
to them as bunting his fastball.

256
00:19:10,628 --> 00:19:12,399
Things change quickly in our world.

257
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:14,502
One second you're playing baseball.

258
00:21:00,752 --> 00:21:02,770
This ain't over between us, Sugino.

259
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:44,252
The odds aren't in our favor, but...

260
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:14,902
Coach Koro will teach you a strategy.

261
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:02,002
His top speed is something like 140.

262
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:05,585
That's right up there with the pros.

263
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:19,909
by restricting ourselves to bunting.

264
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:36,044
Batter number four: Pitcher, Sugino.

265
00:16:40,252 --> 00:16:41,725
It's all good. Don't worry about it.

266
00:18:45,714 --> 00:18:47,891
They dodged in the last millisecond.

267
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:04,899
swing like you're tryin' to kill us.

268
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,460
Well, they haven't decided on it yet,

269
00:04:59,252 --> 00:05:00,774
You've put a lotta thought into this.

270
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,877
Okay, folks. Top of the first inning.

271
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:25,085
Catcher Koro breaks your
concentration with expert trash-talk!

272
00:10:07,011 --> 00:10:08,754
Real strength is about striking true!

273
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,948
We're at the top of the first inning,
and the final boss already throws in.

274
00:13:34,294 --> 00:13:36,460
Bam! Three outs, one after the other!

275
00:14:23,895 --> 00:14:26,585
Batter No.1: Left Fielder, Hashimoto.

276
00:15:47,835 --> 00:15:49,419
The important thing is to not buckle.

277
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:51,377
When you see an injustice, speak out!

278
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,318
Bottom of the third. The end is nigh!

279
00:18:57,585 --> 00:18:59,506
Holding back ain't gonna cut it, pal.

280
00:20:04,774 --> 00:20:07,079
Until final exams, my good Principal!

281
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,099
You're still a better player than me.

282
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:41,979
I mean, we all get along really well,
but collectively we suck at baseball.

283
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,661
Seriously, though, let's do something.

284
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:24,232
Wow, sounds to me like somebody thinks.

285
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:11,721
Not to be negative, but we're screwed.

286
00:04:19,163 --> 00:04:20,620
High schools are already scouting him.

287
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:46,377
Swing, battah-battah! Sa-wing, battah!

288
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,002
and get it to go where you want it to.

289
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,187
No denying the boy's making an effort.

290
00:19:42,478 --> 00:19:44,159
Well damn, that was totally pointless.

291
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:55,899
If only people could see was going
on behind the scenes. Too bad, really.

292
00:00:07,502 --> 00:00:09,273
Let's start spending more time outside.

293
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,964
A healthy body promotes a healthy mind.

294
00:04:03,012 --> 00:04:04,794
We should ask Sugino for some pointers.

295
00:04:47,877 --> 00:04:50,960
I forgot you don't need much persuading
when comes to anything baseball.

296
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,085
This really blows. Why do we even play?

297
00:07:50,743 --> 00:07:53,201
Even pros get discombobulated by bunts.

298
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:12,845
Practicing against you really paid off.

299
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,939
Batter three is safe! Am I seeing this?

300
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:03,238
But real strength is a different story.

301
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,233
It isn't about striking hard, or often.

302
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:46,835
Matter of fact, I've never felt better!

303
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:02,544
Take him to the infirmary, immediately.

304
00:11:03,713 --> 00:11:06,075
I'll act as coach while you recuperate.

305
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,382
Technically, if it's in fair territory,
they can defend however they want.

306
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:46,752
But the fact is neither here nor there.

307
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:02,238
Don't think of this as merely baseball.

308
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:09,190
How about we shake things up a bit, eh?

309
00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:19,868
which do you imagine is more inspiring?

310
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:56,026
we chosen ones are perfectly justified.

311
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:44,966
Again with the tight defense positions!

312
00:19:57,794 --> 00:19:59,919
This was a straight-up battle of wills.

313
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,926
Didn't mean for things to get so crazy.

314
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:32,016
Don't feed me that line; you wanted
to prove you were stronger and you did.

315
00:03:49,252 --> 00:03:51,752
So it's not exactly a consolation prize.

316
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:01,312
Hey, hold on a second! You can't just...

317
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,252
All right. Time for the exhibition game.

318
00:06:06,906 --> 00:06:08,787
even better question: where's our coach?

319
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:31,544
Kimura is the fastest runner in E Class.

320
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:50,669
but they're still just junior high kids.

321
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,479
Shindo's pitches top out at
approximately 140.5 kilometers per hour.

322
00:13:02,468 --> 00:13:04,710
Rather, think of it as a reconnaissance,

323
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:38,681
The Shindo we all know and love is back!

324
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,215
Ha. You're cool with this. Right, chief?

325
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:50,419
When it comes to guts and visual acuity,

326
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:55,696
I've wanted to be the feisty, no-nonsense
coach in a sports flick since forever!

327
00:05:01,504 --> 00:05:03,504
I've watched all of you grow more focused.

328
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,660
Why are they so fired up all of a sudden?

329
00:07:53,294 --> 00:07:55,627
But there's nowhere to throw it! No outs!

330
00:08:53,872 --> 00:08:56,858
Which means if we get our heads
around his fastball, we're in good shape!

331
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:52,832
Something's not right about these people.

332
00:10:57,927 --> 00:11:00,245
As I suspected, the poor man has a fever.

333
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:30,363
Sugino of E Class throws the first pitch.

334
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:49,544
My throw will be a force to reckon with."

335
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:29,460
Umpire should've called 'em on it by now.

336
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:33,010
Give E Class a taste of its own medicine.

337
00:16:41,996 --> 00:16:44,824
Imagine my team bunting against amateurs.

338
00:16:56,454 --> 00:17:00,763
Zero outs, bases loaded, and next up to
bat is the baseball team's pride and joy.

339
00:17:12,472 --> 00:17:15,180
The dénouement will be precise, dramatic.

340
00:17:15,474 --> 00:17:17,793
This game will be decided, not by a bunt,

341
00:18:26,343 --> 00:18:28,289
Put everything you've got into the swing.

342
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:57,585
Don't worry, I won't push you kids around,

343
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:23,282
And the center fielder practically catches
it with his eyes closed! Game over, folks!

344
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,627
Isn't he s'posed to teach us his "method"?

345
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:40,701
This will be excellent practice for when
we finally assassinate Koro-sensei, right?

346
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:55,977
According to a note I've just been handed,

347
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,249
The players are converging on the infield!

348
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,015
Everyone makes an effort in their own way.

349
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,757
"My throw will be a force to reckon with."

350
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,894
Baseball's like a foreign language to you.

351
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:01,835
He just missed catching it off the bounce.

352
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:24,188
How shall you answer my move, Koro-sensei?

353
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:20,775
Hey, Mr. Chosen One. Don't worry 'bout us.

354
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:40,502
The winner is, never thought I'd say this,

355
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,520
Use Nagisa as bait, and there's no limit to
how many of the bastards we can shake down.

356
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:34,794
There's great, then there's everybody else.

357
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:19,502
He'll signal us with the color of his face.

358
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:24,627
It's come to a dead stop right on the line!

359
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,106
The runner on first is following his
buddy on second and making a dash for home!

360
00:11:22,877 --> 00:11:24,883
No worries. There's always next time, yeah?

361
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,499
Ugh! Made me so mad I couldn't concentrate.

362
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,627
It is a benchmark on your climb to the top.

363
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:15,835
Batter number eight: Left Fielder, Akabane.

364
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:46,547
Not sure it's working like you want, Coach.

365
00:15:58,616 --> 00:16:00,158
And the ball has smacked against the fence.

366
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:53,816
It was about being proud of my new friends.

367
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,544
The next time we play'll be in high school.

368
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:27,284
I didn't realize delinquents had a "season."

369
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,111
Let's see what the first pitch has in store!

370
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:33,377
Now that our opponents are caught off guard,

371
00:08:30,852 --> 00:08:32,897
Now we study the opposing team's strategies.

372
00:08:59,044 --> 00:09:01,377
I'll be slowing down my pitch, considerably,

373
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:18,102
Furthermore, we can answer all these pitches.

374
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,752
This is unprecedented. E Class has scored...

375
00:12:55,435 --> 00:12:59,498
and rabble like him will fall in the
thousands before the force that propels you.

376
00:14:08,707 --> 00:14:10,627
Their teaching methods are one and the same.

377
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:39,938
Well let's see which of us pisses themselves
when I brain you psychotic little freaks!

378
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:38,424
The game is over. I can't... This is insane.

379
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:46,977
How did they lose to those E Class jerkwads?

380
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,536
Not that anyone's keeping score, but between
this and midterms, I'd saw we're one, one.

381
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,259
It's one little game. Don't be so depressed.

382
00:20:25,954 --> 00:20:27,916
Why'd you go to so much trouble to win then?

383
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,824
Thing is, though, when we practiced bunting,

384
00:01:05,835 --> 00:01:08,432
You get to be in E Class goofin' off all day.

385
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:55,752
If you dweebs wanna be a laughingstock, fine.

386
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:45,558
E Class versus the Kunugigaoka Baseball Team.

387
00:08:17,144 --> 00:08:19,310
Infielder Koro sets up an impregnable barrier.

388
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:29,529
I saw you out behind the school playing
air guitar, Mimura. Ooh, that fret technique.

389
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,150
Not the best idea to be right under my feet,
Coach, 'less the object is to get stepped on.

390
00:16:07,218 --> 00:16:09,850
E Class sets an example impossible to ignore.

391
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:51,464
Now, if the ump had called you on it earlier,

392
00:00:12,877 --> 00:00:14,867
What would the two of you say to some fishing?

393
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,842
Apparently, the team is so concerned about his
health, their hearts haven't been in the game.

394
00:16:10,397 --> 00:16:12,891
All the more so for resorting to cheap tricks.

395
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,100
They leave us out to keep things nice and even.

396
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:36,044
Nothing like watching real losers getting beat.

397
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:44,695
He throws curveballs and fastballs exclusively.

398
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:06,352
Gifted motivator, photographic memory of faces,

399
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:35,901
The only thing we can really do is walk Shindo.

400
00:01:03,282 --> 00:01:05,752
You have no idea how jealous we are of you, man.

401
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:05,644
on which direction you'd like to head in lately,

402
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:37,346
To this end, Takebayashi here has been
spying on them non-stop for the past three days.

403
00:09:53,985 --> 00:09:57,129
Are they playing baseball, or... something else?

404
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:14,909
The ball is headed deep into right center field!

405
00:11:30,787 --> 00:11:33,391
t's just, the other team had huge, jiggly boobs.

406
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:44,075
Four-seam fastballs are what will turn the tide.

407
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,852
You're the first up to bat next inning, correct?

408
00:15:20,122 --> 00:15:22,886
Never pegged you as the type to play dirty, sir.

409
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:38,991
The bunters become the buntees! Quite the twist!

410
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:08,602
You're mine, Sugino! You hear? I will crush you!

411
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:50,615
All that superior firepower wasted. What a joke.

412
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:16,647
The Kunugigaoka Team has Shindo as their captain.

413
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,002
Dude can throw a fastball like nobody's business.

414
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:35,071
I wanna beat the arrogant S.O.B. at his own game.

415
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:08,156
Is it me or does it feel like a crappy away game?

416
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,802
And... Sugino, the hitter, lands safely on third!

417
00:13:14,174 --> 00:13:16,549
Maehara is intimidated by the infielder pressure!

418
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:03,877
Shindo make it to second base with time to spare.

419
00:19:25,502 --> 00:19:28,733
Kimura! C'mon, throw it to first base! Go for it!

420
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:12,187
and practice like our lives depended on it. Blows.

421
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:52,593
a good fastball is the only thing you really need.

422
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:14,115
You've got to wonder how this is going to... Wait!

423
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:42,019
He kept up his skills by joining a municipal team.

424
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:53,794
there'd be a precedent for telling us to back off.

425
00:07:20,252 --> 00:07:22,402
At the bottom we'll get three runs and it's called.

426
00:09:44,908 --> 00:09:47,075
Shindo readies for the next pitch, and what's this?

427
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:36,227
It appears you might be coming down with something.

428
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,480
Shindo, repeat after me. "My strength is infinite."

429
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:54,166
Top of second, and E Class has given up three outs!

430
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:53,024
But... given that the upstarts are having
their own questionable tactics turned against them,

431
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,127
In the Summer months, delinquents are out in droves.

432
00:05:47,502 --> 00:05:49,960
Only the chosen ones get bragging rights, my friend.

433
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:47,222
I want to see high drama. Throw as if to crush them.

434
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:40,720
Quit whining about every little thing and play ball!

435
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,625
A true athlete does not falter before such trickery.

436
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:23,201
You might hit us with your swing, but we'll be fine.

437
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:17,602
Fishing? That sounds like it'd fun. What's in season?

438
00:01:30,377 --> 00:01:32,647
See how you feel after watching me in the tournament.

439
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:59,136
Me an' the boys got too much self-respect. We're out.

440
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,377
This is nuts! You don't bunt a fastball like Shindo's.

441
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,960
The man knows how to light a fire under his students.

442
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,374
Aw, c'mon. Anyone else smell a rat, or is it just me?

443
00:17:58,132 --> 00:18:01,340
But still just another desperate, undisciplined ploy.

444
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:37,794
We get to play the exhibition game at the end, though.

445
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,085
pitted against the Baseball and Girl's Basketball Team.

446
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:00,400
So not a lot of hope for you, but whatever. Good luck.

447
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:26,397
Shindo winds up for his second pitch, and there it is!

448
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,644
Faculty members at this academy do not fail otherwise.

449
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,567
Yeah, Sugino, that's the way! Don't let 'em get a hit.

450
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:13,450
We're at the top of the second inning and the
invincible bunt defense is still the order of the day!

451
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:17,262
The next, something where the stakes are a lot higher.

452
00:21:05,949 --> 00:21:08,414
If the Earth hasn't been blown to smithereens by then.

453
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:57,482
You're pitching in the big tournament next week, right?

454
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:40,044
That's just the way things are. I don't make the rules.

455
00:03:17,784 --> 00:03:20,969
A friendly, class-versus-class baseball tournament, eh?

456
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:40,568
It took getting kicked off the team to understand that.

457
00:06:46,502 --> 00:06:48,835
Let's give our opponents a taste of what I like to call.

458
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:07,425
Not one to languish in the bleachers, our
illustrious principal has stepped up to take the reins!

459
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:33,324
I know. The exhibition game oughta get our minds off it.

460
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:14,560
Do? I think I'll create a teachable moment about hubris.

461
00:11:24,978 --> 00:11:27,894
It was my fault. My suckage dragged the whole team down.

462
00:12:20,384 --> 00:12:23,092
What the hell, dude? They can't actually do this, right?

463
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:33,391
The umpire could call them on it if we felt like it, but
he happens to be on their side. So, fat chance of that.

464
00:18:12,638 --> 00:18:15,838
Uh. I mean, for heaven's sake they're standing so close!

465
00:00:50,413 --> 00:00:52,629
Way to never come by and say hello to your old teammates.

466
00:06:12,294 --> 00:06:17,410
Mr. Karasuma told him he can't draw attention to himself,
so he's using forced perspective to look like a baseball.

467
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:02,002
I, uh... I don't think I care for how this game is going.

468
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:33,906
You're looking alarmingly pale this afternoon, Mr. Terai.

469
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:20,090
I think it's safe to say they're on to our bunt strategy.

470
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:23,870
Ah-ha! I think I get it! So, you hit a ball with a stick.

471
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:28,752
The real baseball team is on defense, and then it's over!

472
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:11,876
I've been building to this moment since the first inning.

473
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,265
I wanted to show 'em off. Especially to you guys, y'know?

474
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:17,419
Don't make such a big deal out of it. He won't understand.

475
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:53,125
That's the only possible explanation for this catastrophe.

476
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:43,725
Anyways. Let's hope the boys are doing better than we did.

477
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,072
The penalty will go to E Class for obstructing the batter.

478
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:17,548
For what it's worth, though, this doesn't change anything.
