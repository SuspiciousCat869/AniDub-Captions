1
00:00:04,856 --> 00:00:06,348
Isn't that a shame?

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,716
I can't see them all from this angle.

3
00:00:10,659 --> 00:00:14,036
Ah, well. A cross-section of the agonized will have to do.

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,681
I ought to poison kids more often.

5
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:24,256
Maybe when this is over I'll invest the reward
money in a steady supply of fresh-faced runaways.

6
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:45,402
Fourteen. No, wait.

7
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:47,013
Fifteen total.

8
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:51,232
And young. Mid-teens or thereabouts.

9
00:00:51,897 --> 00:00:53,425
You can tell by their breathing.

10
00:00:53,707 --> 00:00:56,181
Everyone not laid up with the virus is here.

11
00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:01,466
FYI, this room in completely soundproof.

12
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:05,541
You'll all be Swiss cheese long
before anyone comes to the rescue.

13
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:09,436
Come on, we all know you ain't
got the grapes for homicide.

14
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,635
Surrender like good li'l boys and
girls and we'll go see the Big Guy...

15
00:01:13,492 --> 00:01:15,505
Damn it! I was aiming for his gun.

16
00:01:16,268 --> 00:01:18,745
What the hell? They've got live ammo?

17
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:21,844
That's the sound of one of our boys' M-Sixties!

18
00:01:23,143 --> 00:01:24,934
These aren't just junior high kids.

19
00:01:25,176 --> 00:01:26,751
They're trained assassins.

20
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:28,810
Delicious.

21
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:30,813
Ah!

22
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:35,870
This is shaping up to be a job
I can really sink my teeth into!

23
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:14,266
It's too bright!

24
00:03:14,408 --> 00:03:16,007
Those backlights are blinding!

25
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:19,658
This is gonna be like a
four-star, kill-n'-cook free for all!

26
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:22,863
How'd he fire through such a small gap?

27
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:28,837
I never forget an enemy's position once
they've fired. Acquired that trick in the army.

28
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:31,206
Think of it as battlefield synesthesia.

29
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:36,798
I can echo-locate the source of hostile gunfire
with pinpoint accuracy and check my own gun by taste.

30
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:38,898
Now, then. Heh.

31
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:42,144
I know there's one more stolen firearm out there.

32
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:45,131
Standby, Hayami! Hold your position!

33
00:03:45,713 --> 00:03:47,933
Wise decision not to fire, Chiba. Well played.

34
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:50,343
Our opponent doesn't have a lock on you yet.

35
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,349
Hang tight and wait for my signal.

36
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:54,785
I'll keep an eye on him and
tell you when it's time to shoot.

37
00:03:56,256 --> 00:03:57,798
Where is that coming from?

38
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:03,558
Hey! You in the front row! Don't stare at me!

39
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:08,565
A seasoned marksman versus adolescent assassins.

40
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:11,599
Our modest advantage will, I think, be quite enough.

41
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:12,849
Okay, Kimura!

42
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:15,724
Run five seats to your left! Terasaka and Yoshida!

43
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:17,474
Dash three seats to either side!

44
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:18,641
We've made a blind spot!

45
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:21,027
Kayano, two rows forward into the gap! Go!

46
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:23,081
Karma and Fuwa, move eight seats right!

47
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,821
Isogai! Five seats left!

48
00:04:25,636 --> 00:04:27,749
Idiot. He's shuffling them all up.

49
00:04:28,845 --> 00:04:32,404
Big mistake. Now I know their positions and their names.

50
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:35,382
Verbatim memory, pal.

51
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:38,012
Alternate naming scheme: Student Twelve!

52
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:39,724
Move right and continuing prepping!

53
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:42,756
Students Four and Five, train your
camera on the target from between the seats!

54
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:45,664
Use Ritsu to keep Chiba apprised of his movements onstage!

55
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,332
Ponytail, shift position to front-left!

56
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,548
Motorcycle Fan, you as well: two seats down!

57
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:55,266
The student who checked out Takebayashi's
favorite maid cafe only to discover he kinda liked it,

58
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:57,266
discombobulate the target by kicking up a racket!

59
00:04:57,349 --> 00:04:58,193
You rat-bastard,

60
00:04:58,307 --> 00:05:01,117
that's nobody's business but mine! How'd you even know?

61
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:03,611
Who's who? Where are they? I can't...

62
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,016
All right, Chiba.

63
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:06,615
The moment of truth is upon us.

64
00:05:07,314 --> 00:05:08,558
Get your bearings, my boy.

65
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,626
When I give the command, fire at will!

66
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,748
Crap. Where is he?

67
00:05:13,255 --> 00:05:15,172
Hayami, you're on follow-up as needed.

68
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:17,728
Focus on blocking the enemy's evasive maneuvers.

69
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,141
Now, a word of advice to our cool-headed sharpshooters

70
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:23,929
who flubbed the assassination attempt earlier today.

71
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:29,641
Don't let one failure overshadow the
skills you've worked so hard to cultivate.

72
00:05:29,724 --> 00:05:32,761
The best of us fall short of
our abilities from time to time.

73
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:35,991
You maintain a facade of stoic nonchalance,

74
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:41,558
but feel burdened by the confidence your classmates place
in you all the same. Few guess at your inner anguish,

75
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,849
but it's there just beneath the surface.

76
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:47,266
You're alarmingly calm for someone
with these grades, young lady!

77
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:50,136
Or should I have known better than to expect you to care?

78
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:51,824
He won't explain himself.

79
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:55,214
It's like he can't be bothered.
I don't know my own son anymore!

80
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:58,303
You're not alone in this.

81
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:01,871
You give it a brave face, but you
needn't bear the pressure on your own.

82
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:04,873
If you miss the shot, there's a fallback strategy.

83
00:06:05,058 --> 00:06:06,516
We'll play hot potato with the gun

84
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,849
and continue shuffling everyone until our foe
has no idea where the next shot will come from.

85
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:15,854
The reason that strategy will work is because
everyone here has tasted the agony of defeat.

86
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:19,540
Yes, there's pressure. But your
classmates are in the same boat.

87
00:06:19,715 --> 00:06:21,494
Learn to take solace in that.

88
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,843
Thanks for the pep-talk.

89
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:31,705
Gave me time to get my bearings
and work out a counter-strategy.

90
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:34,556
Everybody's moved except Student Twelve.

91
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:36,781
And I have a pretty good idea where they are.

92
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:38,735
They're all breathing heavy, though.

93
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:40,889
Like they're nervous, cookin' something up.

94
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:42,809
Meh. Doesn't matter.

95
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,941
The second someone pops the li'l head up, they die.

96
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,445
Okey-dokey! Here we go!

97
00:06:49,224 --> 00:06:50,391
Oh, yes.

98
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:54,117
The flavor. I am one with my gun!

99
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:57,430
Student Twelve! Stand and fire, now!

100
00:06:57,757 --> 00:06:58,414
A-ha!

101
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:03,778
A decoy?

102
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:05,525
That's where you want to aim.

103
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:07,209
You got it.

104
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:18,440
Nice shootin' there, son.

105
00:07:18,513 --> 00:07:20,305
Too bad. Now I know wher...

106
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:27,484
Th... They aimed for the brackets on the stage lights!

107
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:29,724
That's not fair!

108
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:37,472
Finally.

109
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:41,792
Tag 'im and bag 'im!

110
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:44,933
I'll just make a scarecrow in total silence.

111
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:45,808
No big.

112
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:47,266
That was a white-knuckle ride.

113
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:48,849
I'm impressed they held it together.

114
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:50,383
I've known pros who would've tanked.

115
00:07:50,474 --> 00:07:52,641
With a balance of opportunity and motivation,

116
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:54,514
anyone can expand their horizon.

117
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,826
They just have to move out of their comfort zone.

118
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:00,116
But we can't often do so on our own.

119
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:02,266
We need a foe to challenge our complacency,

120
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:05,588
force us to draw upon resources we never knew we had.

121
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:09,886
That, you see, is precisely why I became a teacher.

122
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:11,724
To spark potential.

123
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:14,866
To give my students both the opportunity to succeed,

124
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,368
and the motivation.

125
00:08:16,908 --> 00:08:18,908
Some education. Look at 'em.

126
00:08:19,012 --> 00:08:20,865
These kids've just come through a shoot-out.

127
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:22,112
Uh?

128
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:27,317
And here they are. All smiles and self-confidence.

129
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,714
That's not bad.

130
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:40,146
Looks like a good portion of my mobility's back.

131
00:08:40,648 --> 00:08:42,244
I think I'm up to about half-strength.

132
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:46,641
Which means you're about twice as
badass as an average human being.

133
00:08:46,724 --> 00:08:48,736
Why didn't we just send him on this mission alone?

134
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:53,947
That'll lead us to the top floor, right?

135
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:54,782
Yep.

136
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:56,951
We're seriously coming down to the wire.

137
00:08:56,998 --> 00:08:57,474
Children!

138
00:08:57,558 --> 00:08:58,088
Uh?

139
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,683
It occurs to me the mastermind waiting
for us above is not attuned to his resources.

140
00:09:02,823 --> 00:09:06,556
In fact, thus far his hired
hands have been egregiously misused.

141
00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:07,179
Huh?

142
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,324
Lookouts? Glorified bouncers?

143
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,443
This isn't how one employs assassins.

144
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:15,780
If our foe had aligned the men we've encountered
with their skill set, they'd have been fearsome indeed.

145
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:17,083
You've got a point.

146
00:09:17,476 --> 00:09:20,268
The last guy wasn't off target by so much as a centimeter.

147
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:21,849
And consider Karma's opponent.

148
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:24,224
Normally, the man would've simply snuck up behind him

149
00:09:24,308 --> 00:09:25,349
and crushed his windpipe

150
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:27,166
before we even knew of his existence.

151
00:09:27,245 --> 00:09:28,485
No doubt. Sure.

152
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:30,641
Of course. Why didn't I see it before?

153
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:33,724
The mastermind doesn't think like
an assassin because he isn't one.

154
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:35,188
All right. New plan.

155
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,408
First off: Isogai, Terasaka, Yoshida, I want...

156
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:39,512
What's your deal?

157
00:09:39,683 --> 00:09:41,650
Dude, you're seriously burning up.

158
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,373
You feeling okay? Wait...

159
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:46,016
Shut up! I'm fine. Look, man.

160
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:48,474
I've got stamina to spare. It's just a fever.

161
00:09:48,652 --> 00:09:50,038
My system will kick it out.

162
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:52,016
But the virus is deadly!

163
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:54,391
Damn it, Mr. K almost died 'cause of me!

164
00:09:54,703 --> 00:09:56,991
If I hadn't been an idiot, he wouldn't have gotten gassed.

165
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:58,816
And in case you haven't been keepin' score,

166
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,433
that's not the first crap I've pulled that

167
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,354
nearly cost every one their lives.

168
00:10:03,074 --> 00:10:05,318
If I drop out, I'll bring the mission down.

169
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:07,867
Who cares if I'm sick? I'm not gonna do that!

170
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:09,290
Terasaka, don't!

171
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,412
Watch me.

172
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,408
Ooh, namba!

173
00:10:29,606 --> 00:10:31,933
Ninjas are said to have used this walking style.

174
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:34,808
I've noticed my students favor
the silent, thoughtful approach

175
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:37,683
to killing these days over the more abrupt methods.

176
00:10:37,896 --> 00:10:38,806
Look at them now.

177
00:10:39,093 --> 00:10:42,033
Despite the time crunch, they stubbornly refuse to panic.

178
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:43,977
I'm so indescribably proud!

179
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,558
Whoever we're about to face,

180
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:49,872
my students will certainly give
them more than they bargained for!

181
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,454
Odds are the antidote's in the case.

182
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:56,165
And that the case is rigged with plastic explosives.

183
00:10:58,392 --> 00:10:59,484
We're right on time.

184
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:02,759
Ideally we'll be able to take this guy by surprise.

185
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:07,058
If he spots us, his first instinct
will be to go for the detonator.

186
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:09,699
I'll take it upon myself to shoot him in the arm.

187
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,141
Once that's out of the way,

188
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,637
we'll rush in as a group and dog-pile the son of a bitch.

189
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:19,891
Now!

190
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:21,159
Ugh. This itch.

191
00:11:21,184 --> 00:11:21,591
Uh.

192
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:22,192
Uh.

193
00:11:23,662 --> 00:11:26,204
It burns no matter what I do.

194
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:30,519
Still, one man's sensitivity
is another man's hyper-vigilance.

195
00:11:30,662 --> 00:11:33,864
Makes me feel wired to my surroundings.

196
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:39,369
You didn't think this'd be easy, did you?

197
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:44,883
I told you I'd find a way to wipe the octopus
off the face of the earth. Oh, and as you can see,

198
00:11:44,947 --> 00:11:47,572
when it comes to little details like detonator switches.

199
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,522
I'm a big believer in redundancy.

200
00:11:51,206 --> 00:11:52,914
We'd heard that voice before.

201
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,597
Only now, it sounds even more sinister than I remember.

202
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:02,142
I reached out to four professionals before we
came on this trip. Three of 'em freelance killers.

203
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:05,558
But, the other was an old colleague, who, it turns out,

204
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:09,181
went MIA after embezzling funds
from the Ministry of Defense.

205
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:12,894
What in the hell do you think
you're doing? Damn it, Takaoka!

206
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:24,977
What naughty children! Trying to sneak up on dear ol' dad.

207
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:29,425
You disappoint me. I thought
I raised you better than that.

208
00:12:30,102 --> 00:12:34,264
I know some boys and girls that are
going to have to go to summer school.

209
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:39,206
Mr. Takaoka. But... how could you?

210
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:41,399
Let's head up to the roof, huh?

211
00:12:41,614 --> 00:12:44,944
I've got a little surprise up there
you're bound to get a kick out of.

212
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:47,659
Oh, and before you get any bright ideas,

213
00:12:47,826 --> 00:12:51,484
bear in mind you're only alive
because daddy's feeling generous.

214
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:01,157
Hiring assassins,

215
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,616
infecting students with a potentially lethal virus.

216
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:06,646
What the hell is wrong with you? Are you out of your mind?

217
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:10,908
Strong words, there friend. I
assure you I'm perfectly sane.

218
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:14,091
Though, I suspect world-saviors
are often thought of as mad.

219
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,183
If you had done as I instructed
and had the runts of the litter

220
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:20,370
bring the goods on their own,
my assassination plot would've

221
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:23,068
gone off without a hitch and we'd all be winners.

222
00:13:23,722 --> 00:13:25,389
I'd wanted to use what's-her-name.

223
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,908
Kayano? Yeah.

224
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:30,259
She was integral to the plot. Oh-ho, and it was a doozy!

225
00:13:30,746 --> 00:13:35,320
The bathtub in my suite here is
overflowing with anti-Sensei BB's.

226
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:37,976
I'd've set her up in there with the target

227
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:40,651
then entomb the whole setup in concrete.

228
00:13:41,283 --> 00:13:46,058
The only way for the octopus to return to his
normal form without touching the BB's would've been

229
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:50,011
to blow everything sky-high, including the girl.

230
00:13:51,211 --> 00:13:55,599
We all know he'd never do such an inhuman thing
to the children in his care! So, I figured he'd take

231
00:13:55,683 --> 00:13:59,610
the honorable way out and opt to dissolve
in lieu of killing one of his students!

232
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:03,763
He's a monster!

233
00:14:06,032 --> 00:14:10,334
I won't lie, it gave daddy quite a
fright when he saw you'd all come en masse.

234
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:12,549
Doesn't change things much, but still.

235
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:17,827
Oh, and my mood will play a significant
role as to whether you walk out of this alive.

236
00:14:18,805 --> 00:14:19,891
Intolerable.

237
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:22,683
You can't really imagine you'll get away with this.

238
00:14:22,766 --> 00:14:25,008
Actually, I think there's a pretty decent chance.

239
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:27,408
Either way, I believe we can all agree this route's

240
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,768
a hell of a lot more humane than
the treatment I got from your class!

241
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,747
Did you hear?

242
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:36,861
Takaoka got his ass handed to
him by a class of junior kids.

243
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:41,433
He blew his mission after he bragged about
his teaching chops? Oh, man. That's hilarious.

244
00:14:41,657 --> 00:14:44,826
The higher-ups'll think twice before
they give him another assignment.

245
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:48,379
Now, every time I catch people lookin' at me sideways.

246
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:50,650
Every time I think of how you
bluffed me with my own knife,

247
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:53,366
my skin itches so badly I can't sleep through the night!

248
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:55,250
I hope you're proud boys and girls,

249
00:14:55,306 --> 00:14:57,349
because you've condemned daddy to hell!

250
00:14:57,433 --> 00:15:00,113
Negative evaluations, demotions, gossip.

251
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:03,724
You have no idea what it's like! My future is gone.

252
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:09,233
You specifically, Nagisa, must answer for
the grave injustice done to my reputation!

253
00:15:09,568 --> 00:15:11,683
I get it, he asked for the shortest students to come

254
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,433
because he knew Nagisa would be one of them.

255
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:15,341
Nagisa had every right to do what he did to you!

256
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:16,359
I see.

257
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:21,933
So this actually has a lot more to do with you settling
a score than anyone saving the world. Think about it.

258
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:24,516
Is beating up a kid gonna repair your self-esteem?

259
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:27,058
Wouldn't someone my size be more interesting?

260
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:28,992
Look, you crazy son of a bitch.

261
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,511
Nagisa kicked your ass by your own rules,

262
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:33,592
so you've got no one to blame but yourself!

263
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:35,067
And here's the deal.

264
00:15:35,197 --> 00:15:37,641
Even if you'd won, we'd still despise you!

265
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:40,099
Nothing you could've done would've changed our minds!

266
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:42,839
I don't remember asking for your opinion!

267
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:48,489
Love me or hate me, maggots. I'm the guy that can
take half of you out right now with the push of a button!

268
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:53,860
Heh. You, Short Round. Let's go up to heliport.

269
00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:56,155
Just you and me.

270
00:15:57,175 --> 00:15:59,540
Don't do it, Nagisa! You don't have to listen to him!

271
00:16:01,638 --> 00:16:04,474
I don't want to. But I'm gonna.

272
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:06,324
Get a move on! Pick up the pace!

273
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:08,933
I'm afraid what'll happen if I don't do what he says.

274
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:10,183
I'll play along for now and see

275
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:11,683
if I can talk some sense into him.

276
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:14,129
If he calms down, maybe he'll give us the antidote.

277
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,957
Please be careful, Nagisa.

278
00:16:17,021 --> 00:16:18,719
I don't like where this is going.

279
00:16:49,513 --> 00:16:50,199
Don't even!

280
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:52,528
Stay right where you are, tough guy.

281
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:54,750
Don't take this the wrong way,

282
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:58,960
but I don't trust you not to throw a
monkey wrench into my alone time with Nagisa.

283
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,799
There we go. Now it's just you and me, kiddo.

284
00:17:17,713 --> 00:17:19,683
You understand where I'm going with this, right?

285
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,388
Uh!

286
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:24,122
Revenge is an ugly word, but if the shoe fits.

287
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:26,263
You've got it wrong, Mr. Takaoka.

288
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:27,982
I didn't come here to relive our fight.

289
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,063
Course not.

290
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:32,433
You don't have the element of
surprise on your side this time.

291
00:17:33,105 --> 00:17:35,730
There's not a thing up your
sleeve to keep me from killing you.

292
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:39,741
Thing is, it'd be over too fast

293
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:42,404
if I went at you full bore right off the bat.

294
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,891
I want to savor this, so here's what I need from you.

295
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:47,131
Uh...

296
00:17:49,643 --> 00:17:53,439
Get on your hands and knees... and apologize.

297
00:17:53,816 --> 00:17:56,358
Say you're sorry for pulling a cheap trick.

298
00:17:56,391 --> 00:18:00,494
Admit you relied on the ol'
bait-and-swith to cover lack of skill.

299
00:18:07,683 --> 00:18:08,519
I'm, sorry.

300
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:12,053
I don't believe you! Kneel down lower, you little worm!

301
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:16,382
I wanna see your forehead touch
the ground like the sole of a boot!

302
00:18:25,683 --> 00:18:27,933
I'm sorry for pulling a cheap trick on you.

303
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:31,605
I just did it to cover up my
lack of skill. I'm very sorry.

304
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:38,849
Not bad. Now apologize for essentially
asking me to hit the road afterwards.

305
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:40,766
Good gracious, the audacity!

306
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:44,849
All the trouble I went through for
you kids, and that's how you talk to me?

307
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,378
I'm entitled to respect for the sacrifices I made!

308
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:52,010
I was wrong to treat you that way. You deserve respect.

309
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,495
I am truly, deeply sorry.

310
00:18:54,894 --> 00:18:58,111
Please find it in your heart to forgive me. I was wrong.

311
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:03,266
I'm starting to believe you.

312
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:06,334
Daddy feels much better. Was that so hard?

313
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:08,266
You know what this needs,

314
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:11,658
to help the lesson sink in? Pictures of people who've died

315
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,849
from the virus I infected your buddies with.

316
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:16,449
Smog let me borrow a few from his collection.

317
00:19:16,641 --> 00:19:18,349
The effects are spectacular!

318
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:21,866
Boils over every inch of their
bodies, faces like a bunch of grapes.

319
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,224
You'd get a laugh out of that, wouldn't you kid?

320
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:28,396
Please, no!

321
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:05,337
Yes! That's the face I wanted to see!

322
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:10,401
You know, you should make a scrapbook of this
vacation including pictures of your friends dying!

323
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:14,308
You could call it Nagisa's Book of Boiled Over Faces!

324
00:21:02,474 --> 00:21:03,459
Kill you.

325
00:21:09,383 --> 00:21:13,016
That's right. That's the way, sonny boy.

326
00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:14,517
Oh, dear.

327
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:18,331
I'll kill you!
