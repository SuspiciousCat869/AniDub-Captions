1
00:00:04,056 --> 00:00:07,819
"Oh, sexy guy. It's a miracle!"

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,116
See?

3
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:09,955
Simple.

4
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:13,475
Icebreakers like this guarantee a good first impression.

5
00:00:13,598 --> 00:00:19,077
Now, I'm sure we all know someone who's absolute
crap with small talk. Ha. Maybe we are that person.

6
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:22,667
The trick is to put yourself in the shoes of your target.

7
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,764
Kimura, throw me an ice-breaker, quick!

8
00:00:24,848 --> 00:00:25,494
Uh.

9
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:26,488
Hey, there?

10
00:00:26,782 --> 00:00:27,578
No, no!

11
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:30,041
You're just shifting the burden of conversation.

12
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:33,931
If you want a meaningful response, the other
person has to feel you're pulling your own weight.

13
00:00:34,014 --> 00:00:36,952
Try coming at them guns blazing
with an interesting observation.

14
00:00:36,977 --> 00:00:37,953
Okay?

15
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:41,457
Conversation is a challenge for
the best of us, and that's okay.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,781
Don't think in terms of finding
the right words. Let them find you.

17
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:47,161
Just let the conversation flow.

18
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,434
Finesse it like a full-tongued kiss.

19
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:29,038
Ugh!

20
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:31,043
Teaching is such a pain in the ass!

21
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:33,636
At least the students are finally taking a shine to you.

22
00:02:34,132 --> 00:02:36,073
Oh, yeah. Sure. 'Cause that's a load off.

23
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:37,835
Come on, I'm an assassin.

24
00:02:38,149 --> 00:02:41,362
I'm supposed to be killing people,
not hunting octopus with brats.

25
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,308
And while we're on the subject of tentacled pervs...

26
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,659
the son of a bitch is staring at my tits!

27
00:02:46,684 --> 00:02:48,339
Sipping tea doesn't make it classy!

28
00:02:48,364 --> 00:02:51,889
Have I mentioned how much I
admire your "perky" teaching methods?

29
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:53,111
Shut your face!

30
00:02:55,098 --> 00:02:57,662
Stand down. You know he's just pushing your buttons.

31
00:02:57,782 --> 00:02:58,573
Yeah, well...

32
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:00,060
I'll push his buttons!

33
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:01,875
Hmm...

34
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:05,222
Hm. She's feisty today.

35
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,790
Huh. Can't imagine why that might be.

36
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,882
I have better things to do than
twiddle my thumbs in this dump.

37
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,522
If I could just bag the squirrelly bastard.

38
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,378
A snare trap?

39
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:22,756
Who the hell?!

40
00:03:23,473 --> 00:03:25,433
You catch me off guard, Irina.

41
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:29,494
Watching you babysit bunch of kids.

42
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:31,742
It's like TV comedy show.

43
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:33,942
Sir. Why are you here?

44
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,125
What's going on here?

45
00:03:35,556 --> 00:03:37,448
This is your only warning, pal.

46
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:38,430
Let her go.

47
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:40,348
Don't worry about it.

48
00:03:40,431 --> 00:03:42,473
She knows how to handle herself.

49
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:44,787
Right.

50
00:03:45,282 --> 00:03:46,042
So, uh.

51
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,942
Have we met each other somewhere, or is it just me?

52
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,048
We haven't met in person.

53
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,788
But you know my reputation.

54
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:55,306
I do freelance work for government.

55
00:03:55,556 --> 00:03:57,598
As matter of fact, I'm the guy who arranged

56
00:03:57,681 --> 00:04:01,598
to bring Irina Jelavich into
the mix. I'm human resources man.

57
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:04,562
Lovro the Assassin!

58
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:07,223
One of the most dangerous men who's ever lived.

59
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:08,430
Now retired.

60
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:11,984
Trains assassins and books
gigs for them all over the world.

61
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,526
Makes a killing. No pun intended.

62
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:18,387
At the crucial moment, he came through for us,

63
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:22,126
Jelavich is his protégé. But why is he here now?

64
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:25,079
This Koro-sensei fellow happen to be near?

65
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,921
I think he's in Shanghai picking up some almond jelly.

66
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:29,938
Left about a half-hour ago.

67
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,376
Should be back any minute.

68
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:35,722
So rumors of his speed haven't been exaggerated.

69
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:38,654
Well. Good. Glad I came when I did.

70
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,429
You run along home, Irina. I'll take it from here.

71
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:44,708
It's clear you're out of your depth.

72
00:04:46,348 --> 00:04:47,448
Don't get me wrong:

73
00:04:47,473 --> 00:04:49,760
on undercover jobs, you're the best.

74
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:51,973
Once your cover's been blown, however.

75
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:54,819
Well, let's face it, you're no Charlotte Corday.

76
00:04:54,848 --> 00:04:56,614
You have to give me a chance, sir!

77
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,332
I can do this! I know I can!

78
00:05:00,697 --> 00:05:01,653
He's fast.

79
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:03,298
What have I always taught you?

80
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:06,357
Everyone has their strengths and their weaknesses.

81
00:05:06,928 --> 00:05:08,803
A good assassin knows when to go home.

82
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:10,031
Congratulations!

83
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:12,521
You're exactly half wrong and half right.

84
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,063
Hey, hey. Cool it, Game Show.

85
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:16,948
Another ridiculous nickname?

86
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:19,680
Are you determined never to call me Koro-sensei?

87
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:21,745
It's you.

88
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:22,993
I agree.

89
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:25,995
As an assassin, our beloved Irina is nothing special.

90
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:27,873
Frankly, she's crap.

91
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:29,306
No one was asking you!

92
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:31,389
Having said that, she belongs here.

93
00:05:31,473 --> 00:05:34,264
She is, in fact, a perfect fit for this class.

94
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:34,910
Huh?

95
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:38,038
To prove my point, I propose a kill-off.

96
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:40,031
Let us see which of you passes muster.

97
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:42,323
Who is the better assassin?

98
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:43,992
The rules are simple.

99
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:47,454
Whomever kills our friend
Mr. Karasuma first is the winner.

100
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:48,464
Excuse me?

101
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:50,409
Why the hell am I the target here all of a sudden?

102
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:51,961
It has to be you, silly.

103
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:53,047
I'm un-killable.

104
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:55,845
Here. You have all day tomorrow.

105
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:56,988
Oh, I see.

106
00:05:57,281 --> 00:05:59,706
So it's to be a pretend assassination.

107
00:06:00,603 --> 00:06:01,884
Why not? Heh.

108
00:06:02,306 --> 00:06:04,139
There are worse ways to pass time.

109
00:06:05,188 --> 00:06:06,394
Suit yourself.

110
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:10,239
Is this your idea of sticking up for me?

111
00:06:10,264 --> 00:06:10,798
Heh-ah?

112
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:14,139
Shut up! I know what this is:
you're hedging your bets on me

113
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:17,424
because you think I'm easier to
manage than some new schmuck, right?

114
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:19,471
Well, if you don't think I've got what it takes to kill

115
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:23,033
Karasuma and you, somebody's in for a rude awakening!

116
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,422
Huh...

117
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:34,336
So there it is. Expect a few disruptions today, and
hopefully it won't interfere with your studies too much.

118
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,111
Just carry on as normal, all right?

119
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:36,823
Eh...

120
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:37,598
Poor guy.

121
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,077
He just can't catch a break.

122
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,162
Yoo-hoo!

123
00:06:41,258 --> 00:06:41,712
Hm?

124
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,713
Excellent work today!

125
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:46,156
I'll bet you've worked up quite a thirst. Aww!

126
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:47,954
Have an ice-cold beverage!

127
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:51,969
Here, go ahead and knock it back.

128
00:06:52,154 --> 00:06:53,672
It tastes like a rainbow!

129
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:54,749
She drugged it.

130
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:56,350
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

131
00:06:56,736 --> 00:06:58,611
Probably some sort of muscle relaxant.

132
00:06:58,698 --> 00:07:00,698
Immobilize and stab, oldest trick in the book.

133
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:01,466
Uh!

134
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:04,598
What do you take me for?

135
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:07,865
No man in his right mind would let
you close enough to give him a drink.

136
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:14,181
Well. Why don't I just put in here so
you can take it at your leisure... Ow!

137
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:15,859
Oh... Ohh!

138
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:17,614
Pick me up, Karasuma!

139
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,703
Carry me piggyback? Please?

140
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:23,056
Have some self-respect. This is sad.

141
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:24,473
You okay, Professor Bitch?

142
00:07:24,556 --> 00:07:27,307
Hey, no offense, but that little
ploy wouldn't have fooled anyone.

143
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:28,514
My options are limited, okay?

144
00:07:28,544 --> 00:07:30,446
I can't seduce someone who knows my M.O!

145
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:32,348
Chalk it down to occupational hazard!

146
00:07:32,422 --> 00:07:35,225
It's like a paid escort trying
to put the moves on her old man!

147
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:37,489
He knows her too well for her charms to land their mark!

148
00:07:37,553 --> 00:07:38,674
That's sick!

149
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:40,285
Damn it.

150
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:42,306
I'm racing against the clock here.

151
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:45,848
When Lovro's got a target in his
sights, it's only a matter of time.

152
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:48,016
He strikes like a thief in the night.

153
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,559
What do ya think?

154
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:54,316
Exhilarating being the kill-ee, isn't it?

155
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:57,162
Oh, it's a barrel of laughs. Wait a second...

156
00:07:57,282 --> 00:07:59,823
Exactly what happens if I manage to dodge them both?

157
00:07:59,925 --> 00:08:02,125
Huh... I hadn't thought of that.

158
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:04,764
I suppose in all fairness, you'd be the winner.

159
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:05,685
What do I win?

160
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,315
How about I agree to stand stock-still
in front of you for an entire second?

161
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,684
You may shoot and or stab me at will.

162
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:13,614
Don't tell the others, though.

163
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,473
We don't want kickoff a feeding frenzy.

164
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,441
The pot might be a little too
rich to keep everyone honest.

165
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:21,059
Hmm...

166
00:08:21,764 --> 00:08:22,958
Whatever you say.

167
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:35,733
Heh?

168
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:39,339
Head-on?

169
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,177
With all due respect, my friend,

170
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:51,599
how straightforward did you think this was going to be?

171
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,806
You've got skill, but frankly the years haven't been kind.

172
00:08:54,991 --> 00:08:58,209
Until recently, I was in the Elite Special Force.

173
00:08:58,352 --> 00:08:59,694
He is tough one.

174
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:02,129
If Lovro can't get his hooks into him,

175
00:09:02,181 --> 00:09:03,953
what the hell chance do I have?

176
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,796
Hey, wanna win? Step up your game.

177
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,325
You've only got today.

178
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:14,169
Hold on a sec, why are you scared?

179
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:15,181
Don't worry about it!

180
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,778
Just do your best, and try not to lose!

181
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:18,806
FYI: With a good knife,

182
00:09:18,947 --> 00:09:21,099
I can strike five times in a second.

183
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:23,316
So, should be fun.

184
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:28,902
Sir, you... your hand!

185
00:09:30,118 --> 00:09:33,189
I suppose I can't expect to kill today in this condition.

186
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:35,329
What kind of talk it that?

187
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:38,363
Nonsense! That's what it is!
You can do this! Think positive!

188
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:40,436
Even if I wasn't a relic.

189
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:45,073
Even if I could kill that man.
You'd still be out of my reach.

190
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:47,672
Same goes for Irina when you get down to it.

191
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,704
If I can't do it, neither can she.

192
00:09:51,595 --> 00:09:52,560
Very well.

193
00:09:52,745 --> 00:09:55,453
If giving up is your choice, don't let me stop you.

194
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:58,481
But at least stick around to support your protégé.

195
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:02,691
After all, whatever else one might say about her skills,

196
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:06,389
she's certainly proven herself a
capable wielder of death before.

197
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,005
Hm.

198
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,094
Once upon a time, yes.

199
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:14,441
Level with me, okay?

200
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:17,913
Do you honestly believe I can
take down someone like Karasuma?

201
00:10:18,473 --> 00:10:19,473
Of course.

202
00:10:19,556 --> 00:10:23,260
I can't speak to what you may or may
not have learned at the feet of your guru.

203
00:10:23,514 --> 00:10:28,098
But based on what I've seen you accomplish since
you've been here, I'd be a dolt to think otherwise.

204
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,198
Case in point.

205
00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:31,181
The lingerie you ordered yesterday!

206
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,264
If that's not initiative, I don't know what is!

207
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:34,971
Uh! Perv!

208
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:37,114
If you want others to believe in you,

209
00:10:37,197 --> 00:10:39,937
you've got to believe in you. Show them what you've got:

210
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,031
Karasuma, this Lovro fellow, the children.

211
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:43,581
Hm.

212
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:49,718
Yo. Have a look at this, man, it's Mr. K.

213
00:10:49,743 --> 00:10:50,058
Huh?

214
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:54,167
Oh, yeah. He's been eating his lunch
out there a lot lately for some reason.

215
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:58,354
While he's smackin' on his sandwich,
the spider move in for the kill.

216
00:10:58,848 --> 00:11:01,228
Looks like Professor Bitch is gonna go for it.

217
00:11:01,514 --> 00:11:03,978
Mind if we talk for a sec? You an' me?

218
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:08,681
What now? I'm aware this is a pretend
assassination, but I'm done screwin' around.

219
00:11:08,823 --> 00:11:09,324
Huh.

220
00:11:09,598 --> 00:11:11,306
She has a knife, I see.

221
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:14,739
Surely she knows he can smell the ruse from a mile away.

222
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:15,928
The woman's a fool.

223
00:11:16,114 --> 00:11:17,262
Aw, come on.

224
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:19,328
Don't be such a stick in the mud.

225
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:23,056
I'm a girl willing to do whatever it takes to stay here.

226
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:24,413
You know that about me.

227
00:11:25,014 --> 00:11:26,756
No more screwin' around.

228
00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:29,931
Unless that's what you'd prefer in exchange.

229
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:31,973
One good turn deserves another, yeah?

230
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:33,692
You just call the game, love.

231
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:36,164
It's as simple as that, huh?

232
00:11:36,473 --> 00:11:39,343
If I take her knife, this nonsense will be over.

233
00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:41,567
All right, fine. Jab me.

234
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:43,417
Just be quick about it, though.

235
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,014
You're a good sport.

236
00:11:48,312 --> 00:11:49,201
Mr. Lovro,

237
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:52,444
you've been Miss Irina's teacher
for some time, have you not?

238
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:52,991
Hm?

239
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,066
You've noted her communication skills,

240
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,875
her versatility with words?

241
00:11:57,274 --> 00:12:00,953
To watch her pass that on to her
students is to watch a master at work.

242
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:05,123
She's fluent in ten languages because
she's fluent in the ways of people.

243
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:08,554
When she finds the right words,
there's no one she can't reach.

244
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:12,946
And nowhere, I suspect, is she in more
command of her particular gifts than here.

245
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,743
What do ya suppose she's been up to?

246
00:12:17,615 --> 00:12:18,589
Gott im Himmel.

247
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,973
'Kay.

248
00:12:21,103 --> 00:12:22,659
Ready or not, here I come!

249
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,452
Son of a...

250
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:28,708
Didn't see that coming!

251
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,068
Man, this is hot!

252
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:32,030
Yeah! Who's the bitch now?

253
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:36,114
She's building the skills to kill me in
much the same way she'd acquire a new language.

254
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:38,363
Methodically, feeling out the terrain,

255
00:12:38,478 --> 00:12:40,486
drilling vocabulary, so to speak.

256
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:44,931
One look inside her bag and
you'll see there's no room for doubt.

257
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:47,223
This is definitely a woman with a plan.

258
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:49,224
Say goodnight!

259
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:52,354
Take it easy, huh?

260
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:53,538
Great.

261
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,739
If this comes down to strength, I'm boned.

262
00:12:56,473 --> 00:12:57,486
What am I s'posed...

263
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:01,015
Karasuma?

264
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,996
Let me kill you.

265
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,147
Pretty please?

266
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:11,016
Pretty sure it's bad form for a killer to beg permission!

267
00:13:11,403 --> 00:13:12,661
This is ridiculous!

268
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:16,792
Oh fine.

269
00:13:17,723 --> 00:13:20,924
Better to get it over with than
spend all day listening to you whine.

270
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:21,981
You go, girl!

271
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:22,989
She won!

272
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:25,311
Callin' it! Professor Bitch was the first one to hit him.

273
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:27,313
It's not like I lost anything.

274
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:29,013
Koro-sensei was full of it.

275
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:32,065
He'd never just stand there
and let me take pot shots at him.

276
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:37,848
You have to respect a pupil
willing to challenge the master.

277
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,198
Especially when the deck is stacked against her.

278
00:13:40,255 --> 00:13:43,348
Imagine what the children get out
of seeing her rise to the occasion.

279
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,842
Yes, that feisty, can-do spirit is an example for us all.

280
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:48,556
When push comes to shove,

281
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:50,864
if there's any chance of assassinating me,

282
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:53,053
her being here is essential to it.

283
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:56,080
Sir, I...

284
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:59,043
You're the worst student I've ever had.

285
00:13:59,364 --> 00:14:02,022
But, as a teacher, I don't hold a candle to you.

286
00:14:02,846 --> 00:14:04,032
If you can kill 'im.

287
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:05,671
Do it.

288
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:09,031
Absolutely! Yes, sir!

289
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:09,967
I did it!

290
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:12,965
Harsh. Arrogant. Foul-mouthed.

291
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:14,998
But when you see her in her element,

292
00:14:15,242 --> 00:14:17,173
she's a pretty damn good teacher.

293
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:25,297
Hey! The hell's with the suit of armor?

294
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,460
Nothing in our little bet prohibited basic self-defense.

295
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:38,319
You're in a good mood today, sir.

296
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:39,755
Afterschool plans?

297
00:14:40,478 --> 00:14:41,933
As a matter of fact, yes.

298
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,406
I'm flying to Hawaii for a blockbuster premier.

299
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:45,598
This particular movie

300
00:14:45,681 --> 00:14:47,710
I've been chomping at the bit to see for ages!

301
00:14:47,944 --> 00:14:50,108
Seriously? Wow. No fair.

302
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:55,147
What's Mach Twenty good for if I can't
be first in line for an international hit?

303
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:56,941
Sonic Ninja?

304
00:14:57,014 --> 00:14:58,427
It's a big comic book movie.

305
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,556
They've been hyping it since last year.

306
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,384
Don't worry, I'll give you all the gory...

307
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:06,436
Okie-dokie, then.

308
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:07,781
I'd best be on my way.

309
00:15:07,861 --> 00:15:09,867
Koro-sensei! Wait up!

310
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:11,894
We wanna come with you. Please?

311
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:14,531
Oh-ho! Fans of the franchise?

312
00:15:14,556 --> 00:15:15,294
Oh, yeah.

313
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,826
We've been waiting for the sequel for, like, ever.

314
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:20,878
I'm a little surprised you're into comic books, Karma.

315
00:15:21,356 --> 00:15:22,904
It's actually not my thing.

316
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:24,431
I really dig the director, though.

317
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:25,923
It's his first genre film.

318
00:15:26,098 --> 00:15:28,498
I'd like to come, too. If you don't mind.

319
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:31,359
I hope I'm not bothering you.

320
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:32,431
Um.

321
00:15:33,036 --> 00:15:35,431
No offense, Ritsu, but what are you doing in my phone?

322
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:38,906
I took the liberty of uploading
myself into everyone's mobile devices.

323
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:42,681
This way communication between students
is streamlined, and I'm fun-sized!

324
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:44,681
This version of me is called Mobile Ritsu!

325
00:15:44,822 --> 00:15:46,989
Someone else that can do almost anything.

326
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:48,931
If it's not too much trouble, I'd love to know

327
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,514
what it's like soaring through the air at Mach Twenty.

328
00:15:51,598 --> 00:15:54,723
I can even take aerial photos for Koro-sensei's dossier!

329
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:56,139
Well then, children,

330
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,851
let's go to the movies! Brace yourselves for a flight

331
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:01,716
through the stratosphere at super-sonic speed!

332
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:02,969
Okay.

333
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:06,552
I know we asked him on a whim,
but I'm kinda having second thoughts.

334
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:08,098
What'd we just sign on for?

335
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,469
Yeah, well.

336
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:12,550
If we survive, maybe next time
we'll think of safety first.

337
00:16:12,575 --> 00:16:14,198
Oh now, don't be afraid.

338
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:17,827
I'll accelerate gently so as to not shock your systems.

339
00:16:23,848 --> 00:16:25,303
Uh, okay!

340
00:16:26,478 --> 00:16:27,028
Wow!

341
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:29,434
Check it out: The Pacific Ocean!

342
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:32,970
All right.

343
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:35,711
I'm surprise there's not more wind or whatever.

344
00:16:35,822 --> 00:16:38,364
It is because you're using
your head to deflect most of it?

345
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:40,681
Excellent powers of observation, Nagisa.

346
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:43,457
The secret, you see, is my aerodynamic skin.

347
00:16:44,694 --> 00:16:46,802
Normally, my head is soft and squishy.

348
00:16:46,947 --> 00:16:50,148
When exposed to high pressure,
however, it hardens like a shell.

349
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:53,159
That's how I can withstand the
effects of Mach Twenty speed.

350
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:58,020
Did you know that something very much like
my skin plays a role in your day-to-day life?

351
00:16:58,108 --> 00:16:58,403
Uh.

352
00:16:58,507 --> 00:16:59,332
To explain,

353
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:01,017
let's explore the concept of dilatancy...

354
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:03,090
Is he giving us a lecture midflight?

355
00:17:03,538 --> 00:17:06,114
This could be your best chance to assassinate him, Karma.

356
00:17:06,214 --> 00:17:08,406
He's distracted juggling two things at once.

357
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:10,139
Except I don't wanna die.

358
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:14,135
We're over open water at the speed of
sound; physics doesn't support that plan.

359
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:17,018
Koro-sensei has us right where he wants us.

360
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,218
We've got no choice but to listen and learn.

361
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:28,931
And that is how bulletproof vests are manufactured,

362
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:32,256
utilizing the fascinating science behind dilatancy.

363
00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:37,286
I've made you that much smarter, and in
the time it takes to catch Sonic Ninja.

364
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:39,542
We're really here.

365
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:43,316
We're in Hawaii, and we know what "dilatancy" is.

366
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:47,002
Man, it's freezing in here.

367
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:48,723
It's an island thing.

368
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:50,862
They're all about cranking the AC.

369
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:53,826
Let's bundle you up so no one catches pneumonia.

370
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:54,723
Here!

371
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:56,193
Hmm.

372
00:17:57,023 --> 00:18:00,317
This is so cool! I've never been to a movie theatre!

373
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:04,218
Hey. Don't they cut out a bunch
of stuff for distribution overseas?

374
00:18:04,437 --> 00:18:05,854
We gettin' the real deal here?

375
00:18:05,944 --> 00:18:07,642
Where's your sense of adventure?

376
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,520
It shouldn't be all that different than what
we see back home once it comes out over there.

377
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:13,355
And if it is, so much the better.

378
00:18:13,446 --> 00:18:16,328
It'll be like seeing the same
artwork from different angles.

379
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,887
Here. My tentacles can be used as earphones.

380
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:20,989
I'll offer a running commentary as we watch

381
00:18:21,014 --> 00:18:24,084
just in case any nuances of
this version go over your head.

382
00:18:24,163 --> 00:18:25,928
Now, sit back and enjoy the show!

383
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:27,795
Wow.

384
00:18:28,694 --> 00:18:31,495
This... is so... awesome!

385
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:34,530
Hi-yah.

386
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:37,084
Evil doesn't take a vacation. No one...

387
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:39,824
A brooding hero trying to save the world.

388
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:43,629
Kids my age eat this stuff up, but what about Koro-Sensei.

389
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:46,237
Is he really into the whole super hero thing?

390
00:18:47,537 --> 00:18:49,649
This would be even better in 3D.

391
00:18:50,348 --> 00:18:51,514
Oh my god!

392
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:52,644
Nevermind.

393
00:18:58,197 --> 00:19:01,272
Kill me if you must.

394
00:19:01,614 --> 00:19:05,326
But first, behold my true identity.

395
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:07,480
My brother?

396
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,201
What a cliffhanger.

397
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:15,639
They really know what they're doing;

398
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:17,882
I'll go nuts waiting for the next installment!

399
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:22,011
I don't know. I feel like the filmmaker
copped out making the bad guy the brother.

400
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,338
Oh... Well.

401
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:26,444
If you want to find out how the
series ends, I can calculate it!

402
00:19:26,473 --> 00:19:29,056
I'll just make an algorithm of every movie ever made!

403
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:30,520
Give me a couple minutes.

404
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:34,079
Nah, I'm good, thanks. Between the two of you, wow.

405
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:34,746
Huh?

406
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:36,169
Long-lost siblings!

407
00:19:36,264 --> 00:19:37,514
Can you imagine?

408
00:19:37,598 --> 00:19:40,308
Merciful heavens, how cruel fate can be!

409
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,556
Well, what do ya know? Guess it really got to him.

410
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:45,821
Damn, my bad.

411
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:48,602
He's been blubbering like that all the way from Hawaii.

412
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:50,833
Thank you for taking us with you, sir

413
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,787
G'night.

414
00:19:52,194 --> 00:19:53,710
Yes, yes. Goodnight, children.

415
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:56,502
Be careful on the way home.
Oh, and I'd like you to write a

416
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:59,733
detailed synopsis of the film in
your own words for class tomorrow.

417
00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:00,535
Whoa!

418
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:02,005
You're giving us homework?

419
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:04,937
Small price to pay for a free trip to Hawaii!

420
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:09,267
What's up?

421
00:20:09,728 --> 00:20:10,931
Something on your mind?

422
00:20:11,072 --> 00:20:13,120
It's just been an interesting day is all.

423
00:20:13,573 --> 00:20:15,573
We got flown to Hawaii at Mach Twenty

424
00:20:15,598 --> 00:20:18,598
and given a lecture on natural
science over the Pacific Ocean.

425
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:20,262
Ahh, we lead a weird life.

426
00:20:21,098 --> 00:20:25,570
Personally, my favorite part of the whole
experience was watching Koro-sensei protect you.

427
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:27,564
I've never seen anything like it.

428
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:31,649
Did you realize he was using his tentacles
to fend off dust particles and debris?

429
00:20:32,374 --> 00:20:33,553
When you think about it.

430
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:36,257
We saw the world through Koro-sensei's eyes today.

431
00:20:36,473 --> 00:20:37,003
Hmm...

432
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:39,109
The more I get to know the guy,

433
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,883
the more I feel like his everyday life
is something we can't even comprehend.

434
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:45,170
Stiff upper lip, old boy.

435
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:46,583
No more tears.

436
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:50,159
I'm needed at Mimura's for a one-on-one math tutorial.

437
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:57,000
Well?

438
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,313
Did your eyes follow his course?

439
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:01,479
Good.

440
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,204
Then you can kill him.

441
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,575
You mean... him?

442
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:09,361
Yes.

443
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:10,561
Your brother.

444
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,789
Though as of tomorrow, he'll also be your teacher.

445
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:18,188
Now.

446
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:22,652
It's time to reap vengeance
for what's been done to our moon.
