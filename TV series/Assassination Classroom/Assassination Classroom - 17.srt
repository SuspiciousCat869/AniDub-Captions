1
00:00:00,984 --> 00:00:01,984
Surprise!

2
00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:03,849
Tell us, Kunudon!

3
00:00:04,198 --> 00:00:06,699
Hello, boys and girls! It's Kunudon!

4
00:00:06,724 --> 00:00:08,470
Hooray!

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,309
Did you know

6
00:00:09,334 --> 00:00:10,834
the students with the highest scores

7
00:00:10,904 --> 00:00:14,308
here at Kunugigaoka Academy get
dibs on the best vacation ever?

8
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:16,283
Yay entitlements!

9
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,036
That's right!

10
00:00:17,176 --> 00:00:20,117
Three days at one of the finest resorts in Okinawa!

11
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,359
Diplomatic passports!

12
00:00:22,442 --> 00:00:23,224
And the best part?

13
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,750
Not only do students get to hit the books seaside,

14
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,308
your school pays for the whole kit n' caboodle!

15
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:32,113
Summer debauchery! Yay!

16
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,616
Wait! E Class is going this year?

17
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:37,621
F*** that!

18
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:21,645
Wow, this is so cool!

19
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:22,886
Look at all of 'em!

20
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:24,768
Summer vacation.

21
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:28,813
Three months of sweet freedom from the
confines of school, or so you'd think.

22
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:31,397
Uh, remind me again what we're doing out here.

23
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:32,253
Oh.

24
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:34,745
Well, I'm not about to let the guys in my neighborhood

25
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:36,836
catch me collecting insects. Sorry.

26
00:02:37,234 --> 00:02:38,567
At heart, I'm a city boy.

27
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:40,738
That doesn't mean nature doesn't fascinate me, though.

28
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:43,442
Karma showed me this tree a few weeks ago after school.

29
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:44,441
Pretty cool, huh?

30
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:47,824
No offense, but it's weird that
you came along with us, Maehara.

31
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:50,279
Never would've pegged you for the entomologist type.

32
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:51,775
I figured, what the heck?

33
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:54,109
Okinawa's coming up, we don't wanna be unprepared.

34
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:55,359
Think about it, my friend.

35
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,317
What's the one thing we'll need to most of?

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,049
I dunno know.

37
00:02:58,301 --> 00:02:59,549
Cold hard cash!

38
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:02,400
We're gonna be up to our eyeballs in bikini-clad babes,

39
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:03,611
and that talon ain't cheap!

40
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,700
Now that little runt there ain't worth much, but...

41
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:07,234
we track down a stag beetle?

42
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,400
Dude! We are talkin' mucho dinero!

43
00:03:09,484 --> 00:03:11,567
Seriously, have you seen what they go for online?

44
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,442
Easily enough to score a four-star dinner

45
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:15,109
and kick it poolside under an umbrella

46
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:16,572
with the hottie of your choice!

47
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:20,097
I get the feeling he's not real focused
on what the trip is supposed to about.

48
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:20,851
Yeah.

49
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:24,125
His idea of a good time seems a little mature for his age.

50
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,625
It's not gonna work.

51
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,317
Stag beetles are pretty old news.

52
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,867
Hey!

53
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,105
Hi, guys!

54
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:33,046
Tryin' to scrape up some spending money for our getaway?

55
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:34,087
Maybe.

56
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,370
What do you know about stag beetle trends?

57
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:37,459
Well.

58
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:42,444
They were worth a ton a few years
ago, but not so much, recently.

59
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:45,264
Artificial breeding caused supply to outweigh demand.

60
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,522
Now a dozen aren't worth a
third of what one used to bring in.

61
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:52,025
Wha? The Great Stag Beetle Crash was a real thing?

62
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:55,192
But my buddy said the
insect-to-hot-babe ratio was one to one.

63
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:57,025
Your buddy's out of it, Casanova.

64
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:59,167
Girls have always been more expensive than that.

65
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:00,933
You sure know a lot about bugs.

66
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:02,419
Never thought that'd be your thing.

67
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:05,277
Oh. Every living creature's my thing.

68
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:08,695
I know! Since we're all here,
let's go bug hunting together!

69
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,126
With all four of us looking,
I bet we'll find a whole bunch!

70
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:13,509
Hinano Kurahashi,

71
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:15,974
poster child for upbeat and innocent.

72
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:19,001
She also happens to know a lot about natural science.

73
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,002
Having her around might be a big help.

74
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:22,637
Right!

75
00:04:24,109 --> 00:04:26,476
Not a bad haul, if I do say so myself.

76
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:29,510
That's pretty cool! Did you set this trap here?

77
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:31,957
Sure did. Put it out last night.

78
00:04:32,109 --> 00:04:33,721
Used my own homemade recipe, too.

79
00:04:33,993 --> 00:04:35,368
And there's more where that came from.

80
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:38,569
I set about 20. That works out to a thousand yen each.

81
00:04:38,676 --> 00:04:39,680
Not too shabby.

82
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:42,595
Ahh. Pretty good racket to have on the side.

83
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:45,425
I just hope we caught the one
I was looking for specifically.

84
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,283
Nice trap. For an amateur.

85
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:49,222
And you call yourselves assassins.

86
00:04:49,827 --> 00:04:50,722
Okajima!

87
00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:53,702
Hey, if you're happy with a
thousand yen, that's your deal.

88
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:57,737
Just try not to get jealous when my
homemade trap makes yours truly a billionaire.

89
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:00,168
Billionaire?

90
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,817
I don't mess with chump change.

91
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,767
It's Summer, guys.

92
00:05:02,827 --> 00:05:04,934
We're gonna be on vacation for cryin' out loud.

93
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:06,698
You want spending money?

94
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:09,032
Pretty soon I'll have enough to buy Okinawa.

95
00:05:09,444 --> 00:05:11,106
Check out my beetle trap.

96
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,109
Oh, yeah. It's what you think.

97
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:18,552
The best way to bait Koro-sensei is with porn.

98
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:21,234
Wow. For a guy who moves at Mach 20,

99
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:23,984
he sure stops to smell the roses when it comes to that.

100
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:25,901
Look at him. He's completely riveted.

101
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,410
Anyone else think it's weird

102
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:29,057
he's dressed like a stag beetle?

103
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,462
A giant stag beetle with tentacles.

104
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:32,304
Way to blend in.

105
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:35,365
Every wooded area has its own secret stash.

106
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:37,756
Its special repository for smut.

107
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,067
You stumble across it when you're a kid,

108
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,626
and it's like a veil's been lifted.

109
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,714
Your eyes are opened for the first time.

110
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,275
Later, when you've grown up,

111
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:47,369
you donate your own collection to the stash.

112
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:48,744
The circle of life.

113
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,317
This is what it is to become a man.

114
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,734
And this guy's got a feelin' today might just be the day

115
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:55,139
we're all ushered into adulthood!

116
00:05:55,172 --> 00:05:58,364
Eh. That doesn't sound like the circle of life to me.

117
00:05:58,751 --> 00:05:59,876
You'd be so proud of me.

118
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,917
I did a ton of research into what he likes.

119
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:03,360
I'm too young to buy the stuff,

120
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:04,857
but where there's a will there's a way.

121
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:08,277
Uh? Wouldn't just about anything
with big boobs do the trick?

122
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:10,160
Oh man, shows how little you know!

123
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:11,971
Porn's what dreams are made of.

124
00:06:12,057 --> 00:06:13,515
But every dream is different.

125
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:14,814
Workout magazines.

126
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:17,595
Manga. The hardcore stuff they sell in black plastic bags.

127
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,937
Your ideal type awaits!

128
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:20,726
This is kinda impressive.

129
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:25,109
You've been swapping out the magazines in your
stash for over a month to determine what stuff he likes.

130
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:30,117
Okay, but why would an adult need to look through
some underage kid's secret collection? That's just sad.

131
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:32,897
Hey. You an' me have a lot in common, right, Kurahashi?

132
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:36,484
We both get so absorbed in our prey we
end up knowing exactly what makes 'em tick.

133
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:37,333
Uh-huh.

134
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,970
I may have a filthy mind.

135
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,383
But its served me well in pursuit of my goal.

136
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:46,174
It's because I'm a self-aware, first-class
perv that I know the uncomfortable truth.

137
00:06:47,851 --> 00:06:51,035
In the end... pornography will save the world.

138
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:53,530
He's so cool somehow!

139
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:54,609
Check it out.

140
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:58,496
Under that glorious stack of filth
is a net strung with Anit-Sensei BB's.

141
00:06:58,827 --> 00:07:00,975
And he's so distracted, he has no clue.

142
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:04,479
When I give the word, one of you cut the rope.

143
00:07:04,743 --> 00:07:06,568
I'll jump in and finish him off.

144
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:10,057
I suppose anything can be a sword if you polish it enough.

145
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:12,861
Okajima's porn trap could actually do the trick.

146
00:07:13,085 --> 00:07:15,307
Koro-sensei, prepare to be run through.

147
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:16,801
Mm?

148
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,462
Um, what's he doing?

149
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,834
Why did his eyes go all "dwee"?

150
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,984
Yeah, I don't have any data on that face!

151
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,846
What kind of porn does that signify?

152
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:32,121
Thought you could hide from me?

153
00:07:34,397 --> 00:07:35,859
A Miyama stag beetle.

154
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:37,364
With white eyes.

155
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:40,048
No! Are you serious?

156
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,585
Ah, hello, Kurahashi!

157
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:42,852
Impressive specimen, eh?

158
00:07:42,877 --> 00:07:45,542
Wow! I've been looking for one like this forever!

159
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:46,237
I know, right?

160
00:07:46,262 --> 00:07:48,111
Imagine it being in our own back yard!

161
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:50,980
Come on! Another second and we would've had 'im!

162
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:52,943
I don't get what they're so excited about,

163
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:55,293
but a giant stag beetle and a junior high girl

164
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,067
dancing on top a pile of porn

165
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,644
isn't something you see every day.

166
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:06,084
How unbelievably embarrassing.

167
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:07,846
I'm mortified beyond belief.

168
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:09,992
Shame on me.

169
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:13,169
A molder of young minds ought
to be above this sort of behavior.

170
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:15,685
I knew there was a trap under all this porn,

171
00:08:15,784 --> 00:08:18,117
and yet, each magazine was so much more tempting

172
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:20,025
than the last, I hadn't the presence of mind to resist!

173
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:21,576
He saw right through me!

174
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:23,753
So what's the big deal with this beetle?

175
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:25,975
It's just a Miyama stag beetle, right?

176
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:27,567
Didn't you say that artificial breeding,

177
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,275
made 'em all pretty much worthless?

178
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:32,778
Actually, these go for a lot on
account of being very hard to breed.

179
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:34,939
A mid-sized one is worth its weight in gold.

180
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:37,900
One as big as this fellah? We're talkin' a small fortune.

181
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:38,738
Shut up!

182
00:08:38,843 --> 00:08:40,850
Also, observe the color of its eyes.

183
00:08:40,964 --> 00:08:42,109
Usually, they're black.

184
00:08:42,192 --> 00:08:44,227
These, however, white as the driven snow.

185
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:46,427
We've discussed albinism before, correct?

186
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,525
So I assume you're familiar with the concept.

187
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,076
Yeah.

188
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:52,028
It's like, when an animal's
born without pigment or whatever.

189
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:55,359
With stag beetles, albinism
is only possible with the eyes.

190
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:58,361
A natural-born Miyama white-eye,
as they're called in the literature,

191
00:08:58,436 --> 00:08:59,894
is exceptionally rare.

192
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:02,136
A valuable academic find, to be sure.

193
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:05,027
This guy goes for hundreds of thousands of yen.

194
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:06,625
Hundreds?

195
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,375
I told Koro-sensei a while back

196
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,942
I wanted to see one up close.

197
00:09:10,012 --> 00:09:12,821
He promised to use his zoom-eyes
to find one of them for me.

198
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:16,594
Okie dokie, boys. Which one
of you rejects wants this baby?

199
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,293
Me!

200
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:19,899
Ha, you'll have to catch me first!

201
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:22,250
I beg your pardon! I've already done my catching!

202
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:25,495
Whether in natural science, assassination, or porn,

203
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:27,981
Summer Vacation is a time for discovery.

204
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:32,311
Let's hope a week from now in Okinawa, we
can put what we've discovered to good use.

205
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:41,768
Our Assassination Vacation is soon.

206
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:44,334
Not a lot of time to make a foolproof plan.

207
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:47,773
But saying we've upped the ante on
our training regimen would be accurate.

208
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:50,067
Oh, you adorable brats.

209
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,442
Go ahead, spend Summer vacation working up a sweat.

210
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,613
I'll be relaxing, thank you very much.

211
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:56,567
You need this too, Professor Bitch.

212
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,734
In fact, I'd say of everybody
here, you need to level-up the most.

213
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:01,485
I'm an adult, hon. We're sneaky.

214
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:03,341
You'll go at him with your customary verve

215
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:05,949
and I'll piggyback on all that
hard work to steal the show.

216
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:06,761
Will you now?

217
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:08,976
Some things can be counted on never to change.

218
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:09,667
Ah!

219
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:10,899
Lovro, sir!

220
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:14,204
He's been hired on as a special instructor for the break.

221
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:16,103
We need all the pro tips we can get.

222
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,025
He seemed like the obvious choice.

223
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:22,712
Relax for even one day, and your killing muscles atrophy.

224
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:25,643
Unless you want to fail, wear something respectable!

225
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:27,640
What do you know?

226
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:30,593
Someone even Miss Bitch doesn't dare mouth off to.

227
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:33,349
Can't say I blame her, man. He's as scary as they come.

228
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:35,121
Thank you for your cooperation.

229
00:10:35,277 --> 00:10:37,536
Do not thank me yet, my upright friend.

230
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:40,400
I am afraid I could not manage to establish the contacts

231
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:41,312
you requested.

232
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:44,234
Perhaps your former students were put off

233
00:10:44,317 --> 00:10:46,086
by word of the target's difficulty.

234
00:10:46,442 --> 00:10:47,373
It is likely.

235
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,084
In any event, we must rely on what we have.

236
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:55,222
Now, then. Just to be clear. The target is not here?

237
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:58,511
That's correct. He's taken a sabbatical to Everest.

238
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,966
Not a big fan of the heat.

239
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:02,754
If we are to have any chance at all,

240
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,486
secrecy is of utmost importance.

241
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,283
This is your plan?

242
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:11,234
You neutralize the seven promised tentacles,

243
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,692
and taking advantage of his reduced speed,

244
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:17,660
the entire class throws in and finishes him off. Not bad.

245
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:21,900
But I wonder if you would explain
to me this business of "psych attack"?

246
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:25,067
Well, the idea is to throw him
off guard, and slow him down.

247
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,208
Oh, he likes porn.

248
00:11:26,306 --> 00:11:28,067
Makes no bones about where he gets it, either.

249
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:29,338
Figure we'll use that on him.

250
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:32,467
Look, just promise not to tell your classmates, all right?

251
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:34,743
He bought our silence with a round of popsicles,

252
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:38,091
but it's gonna take a lot more than
that to keep us from spilling the beans!

253
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:40,942
Let's gang up and teach the
perv a lesson he won't soon forget!

254
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:43,989
It would really get in his head
if we threatened to blackmail him.

255
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:46,025
He'll be so freaked out by what we've got.

256
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:47,723
These children are brutal.

257
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:52,569
That said. The key to assassination is killing blow.

258
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:56,724
The difference between success
and failure is timing and aim.

259
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,353
Be straight with me.

260
00:11:58,628 --> 00:12:00,704
Are you worried the class doesn't have what it takes?

261
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:02,525
No worry. Not at all.

262
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:04,876
In fact, I am quite confident in them.

263
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,131
That one's Chiba Ryunosuke.

264
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:10,499
Excels in spatial calculations.

265
00:12:10,718 --> 00:12:14,036
As a long-range sniper, I daresay he's second to none.

266
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:16,521
Then there's Rinka Hayami.

267
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:18,700
Good balance, admirable dexterity.

268
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,148
Unparalleled kinetic visual acuity.

269
00:12:21,317 --> 00:12:23,825
There's no one better for taking down a moving target.

270
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:28,067
You never hear these two brag about their skills.

271
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,197
They let their results do the talking.

272
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,534
Yes. I would love to have them as students of my own.

273
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:37,522
But if I speak the truth, I would take any in this class.

274
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:41,033
I am amazed how well their talents
have grown in so short a time.

275
00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:42,845
There is potential here.

276
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,964
Much of it.

277
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:49,609
She has learned to stabilize her aim.

278
00:12:49,692 --> 00:12:52,817
Some discover they shoot best from cross-legged position.

279
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:53,460
Well done.

280
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:54,516
Wow, thanks!

281
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:55,727
That means a lot!

282
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,811
You there. Mind how you breathe.

283
00:12:58,234 --> 00:13:01,523
Do not force it. Find shooting style that best suits you.

284
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:03,802
This guy really knows assassination.

285
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:07,244
I'm dying to ask him a question. I wonder...

286
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:09,301
Mr. Lovro, sir?

287
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:09,826
Hm?

288
00:13:10,303 --> 00:13:10,961
Him!

289
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:13,702
Young man?

290
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,334
I assume you know the best assassin in the world, right?

291
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:17,397
But what are they like?

292
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:20,150
At a glance, this boy is not much.

293
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:23,346
Ha, ha. But on closer inspection.

294
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:25,192
What a bizarre question.

295
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:26,984
Why are you wanting to know, son?

296
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:29,591
Uh. It doesn't. I was just curious.

297
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:32,992
Ah. Well. In my considered opinion,

298
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:36,569
there can be no question as to who
holds the rank of World's Greatest.

299
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:41,176
Of course, professional killers are a secretive lot.

300
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:43,328
They are rarely known by their given name.

301
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,037
This one is no exception,

302
00:13:45,144 --> 00:13:48,437
save he prefers to go by a very particular nickname.

303
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,820
"The Reaper."

304
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:54,236
Mysterious. Elusive. Cold as ice.

305
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:56,509
Trails of dead in his wake.

306
00:13:56,725 --> 00:14:00,475
Death incarnate. An assassin from whom no target escapes.

307
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,692
It is said if a killer cannot finish a job,

308
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:06,107
sooner or later the Reaper will step in to do it for them.

309
00:14:06,241 --> 00:14:07,839
Sounds pretty intimidating.

310
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,942
We'd better kill Koro-sensei
before someone like him appears.

311
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,489
Pay attention, young man.

312
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:16,023
I will teach you a technique that works without fail.

313
00:14:16,317 --> 00:14:17,509
Works without fail?

314
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:21,449
Indeed. A useful move for all occasions.

315
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:24,580
A gift from an old pro.

316
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:30,062
And just like that, our Summer island getaway kicks off.

317
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:31,443
I think we're ready.

318
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:46,834
A boat. Why do we have to be on a boat?

319
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:48,650
Couldn't we have taken a plane?

320
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:52,013
Ugh. My head feels like a washing machine.

321
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,942
Oh! I can see the island from here!

322
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:56,851
Take a look! We're almost there!

323
00:14:57,734 --> 00:14:59,400
Six whole hours from Tokyo.

324
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:01,900
The perfect setting to for an all-out assassination.

325
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,802
Okinawa!

326
00:15:08,226 --> 00:15:10,755
On behalf of the Fukuma Resort Hotel, welcome.

327
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,519
We hope your stay is a pleasant one.

328
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:15,824
Tropical juice, compliments of the house. Enjoy.

329
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:17,775
We are livin' the high life!

330
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:20,639
You ain't jokin', man. Everything's so island-y!

331
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:23,530
A hotel right on the beach. Outstanding.

332
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,883
And a smorgasbord of structured leisure activities.

333
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:29,506
We're be savin' the you-know-what till after we eat.

334
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:32,234
Right now I vote we have some fun island style.

335
00:15:32,317 --> 00:15:33,609
Why don't we all split up into groups

336
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:35,544
like we did on the school trip to Kyoto?

337
00:15:36,763 --> 00:15:39,858
A grand idea. Play hard, kill hard.

338
00:15:41,077 --> 00:15:42,618
This is how top-notch assassins

339
00:15:42,686 --> 00:15:45,251
get the most outta their Summer Vacation!

340
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:45,832
Uh...

341
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,111
That hang glider seems to be goin' kinda fast.

342
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,604
What the...

343
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:50,959
Did that crazy bastard just pull a ninety-degree turn

344
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,291
comin' out of a barrel roll?

345
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,326
Aw, c'mon! This isn't fair!

346
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:58,809
How can we keep up with you goin' all daredevil?

347
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,317
Calculating current speed.

348
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,866
Target moving a hundred fifty kilometers per hour.

349
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:05,609
Remember boys and girls:

350
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:08,025
a fighter jet is only as good as its engine!

351
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:09,734
Who the hell are you supposed to be dressed as?

352
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:10,954
Jiro Horikoshi.

353
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,317
Ha, ha. Very funny.

354
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,650
Whoa, whoa! Jiro who?

355
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:15,609
Horikoshi was an aerospace engineer.

356
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:17,739
Oh, yeah. I'm just gonna know that!

357
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:20,630
Group one's doing all right with keeping him distracted.

358
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:24,784
You have to respect anyone ballsy enough
to take shots at a guy in mid-flight.

359
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:27,017
Good luck not drawing unwanted attention, though.

360
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:27,820
No kidding.

361
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:30,290
Okay, people! We're up next! It's go time!

362
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:32,531
Everybody do what they need to so we can go change!

363
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:33,135
On it!

364
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,486
The idea is to make it look like we're having fun,

365
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:37,817
even though we're working.

366
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,381
What looks like snorkeling is actually recon.

367
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:42,703
We need to find the perfect spot.

368
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:44,369
Ho-ha!

369
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:45,703
That's a new look for you

370
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:46,900
What's that face mean?

371
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:49,601
It means only the front portion
of the hang glider was shielding me,

372
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:51,455
and I neglected to use enough sunscreen.

373
00:16:51,686 --> 00:16:52,349
Now, then.

374
00:16:52,374 --> 00:16:54,793
Did Group Four have dolphin watching on the itinerary?

375
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,786
Yeah.

376
00:16:55,985 --> 00:16:57,988
It's on a boat, though. That okay?

377
00:16:58,277 --> 00:16:59,377
Fin-tastic!

378
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:01,585
So far, so good.

379
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:06,203
Each group takes turns keeping Koro-sensei
busy while the others set their plans in motion.

380
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,496
Where is he right now?

381
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:12,241
Group three has him touring deep sea caves on
the other side of the island. He can't see us.

382
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:13,560
We should be good to go.

383
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:17,692
Oughta give us more than enough
time to scout out a decent sniper spot.

384
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:20,050
I suggest we be quick about it all the same.

385
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:22,029
Smooth operators, those two.

386
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,229
If I didn't know better,

387
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,049
I'd think they've done this before.

388
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:32,207
Really? Aw, damn it!

389
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:34,775
For the love of all that's holy, it's a beach!

390
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:36,298
Where'd all the hot guys go?

391
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:39,087
Last of the guests skipped out about 15 minutes ago.

392
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:42,400
I'm afraid this whole site's been
reserved for E Class shenanigans only.

393
00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:44,359
They get an entire beach to themselves?!

394
00:17:44,442 --> 00:17:47,309
I didn't squeeze into this
outfit to get ogled by the busboy!

395
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:50,354
This is their most ambitious assassination plot yet.

396
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:52,746
Hard to believe it's going so well.

397
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:54,952
Would it kill you to ditch work-mode?

398
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:57,289
Come on, there's a gorgeous babe right in front of you.

399
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:00,067
There's only one thing left to worry about.

400
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:03,842
Oh, hey. Look at you, taking charge.

401
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:06,703
This settings really brings out those primal urges...

402
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:08,951
You asshole!

403
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:10,889
Hey. I have a question for you.

404
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,495
Huh?

405
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,512
You've had more than your
share of field experience, right?

406
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:17,213
How often does an assassination plan work perfectly?

407
00:18:19,984 --> 00:18:21,192
It's pretty rare.

408
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,809
If you're asking for my professional opinion,

409
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,777
let me just tell you,

410
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,792
what these kids have in mind is far too complicated

411
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:27,819
not to go tits up somewhere down the line.

412
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,443
All in all, it's not a bad plan. I'll give 'em that much.

413
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,001
Hell, I'm not just here to work on my tan, am I?

414
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:36,202
I'm gunnin' for my share of the spoils.

415
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:39,436
When things go south, and they will, I'll be there.

416
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:41,565
Waiting to take the kill shot.

417
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:46,729
However this goes down, I just want it to work.

418
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:50,250
Whew! What fun, eh?

419
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:53,100
Sun, surf, sand, and more sun.

420
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,692
What's with the tan?

421
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:56,609
How is it, even your teeth have a tan?

422
00:18:56,692 --> 00:18:58,924
So much for being able to gauge your expression.

423
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:02,109
Have fun while you can, sir, 'cause after dinner, it's on!

424
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:04,609
Ah, yes! The shipboard restaurant!

425
00:19:04,692 --> 00:19:05,804
I'm famished!

426
00:19:06,317 --> 00:19:08,587
Huh. You'd think he'd be worn out by now.

427
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:09,610
I'm worn out.

428
00:19:09,654 --> 00:19:10,904
How much longer we gotta do this?

429
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,479
Can't we just kill him already?

430
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:13,955
Nah. Be patient.

431
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,673
We'll knock him tonight, then
throw in for some real R and R.

432
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:17,698
So epic!

433
00:19:17,993 --> 00:19:18,803
Everything's set up.

434
00:19:18,846 --> 00:19:20,621
There's no way we don't have this in the bag.

435
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,845
Neat, huh?

436
00:19:23,146 --> 00:19:25,382
We rented out the whole restaurant just for us.

437
00:19:25,476 --> 00:19:28,137
We can enjoy the ocean air and eat our dinner in private.

438
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:29,544
Can we indeed?

439
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:33,942
Somehow I get the sneaking suspicion
you're trying to get me seasick.

440
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:35,234
That's a fair assumption.

441
00:19:35,317 --> 00:19:37,761
Weakening the target is Assassination 101.

442
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,511
Well played, my boy.

443
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,817
But is your gambit as infallible as all that?

444
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,567
Seasick or not, a target expecting an attempt on his life

445
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,984
isn't likely to take it sitting down.

446
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:49,692
You look like a bowling ball!

447
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:51,075
It's the sunburn, isn't it?

448
00:19:51,234 --> 00:19:52,359
Forget your expression.

449
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,234
We can't even tell the front from the back.

450
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:56,598
Can you do something about it? It's freaking me out.

451
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:59,688
Oh, of course! I can do plenty.

452
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:02,650
Have you children forgotten perhaps my quirkiest quirk?

453
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:03,963
I can molt!

454
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:06,817
There we go. All better.

455
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:08,891
Um, can't you only do that once a month?

456
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:10,025
Or, strictly speaking,

457
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,609
whenever the occasion warrants.

458
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:14,417
But I rely on it sparingly, as the energy consumed...

459
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:16,931
Heh...

460
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:19,462
Seriously?

461
00:20:19,572 --> 00:20:22,458
Of all the times to put himself
at a disadvantage, he picks now?

462
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:25,857
Sorta makes you wonder why we
haven't been able to kill him before.

463
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:26,969
This is it.

464
00:20:27,383 --> 00:20:30,258
We've been training all summer long for this moment.

465
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,911
No mistakes.

466
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:36,369
Everything's in place. This time we hit our mark.

467
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:38,091
Absolute heaven!

468
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,287
Hope you got the most out of dinner.

469
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:48,160
It may turn out to have been last.

470
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,122
Get a load of the spot we picked out.

471
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,320
Heh?

472
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:55,071
It's a floating chapel. Nice and far from the hotel.

473
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:04,184
C'mon. It's all right. Have a seat and relax.

474
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,861
Might as well. There's nowhere for you to run, now.

475
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:08,321
This'll be fun.

476
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:11,542
Whaddya say we start things
off with a little pre-show flick?

477
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:15,791
I daresay, things are about to
get more than a wee bit interesting.

478
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,597
Let me see that inventive spirit shine through!

479
00:21:20,234 --> 00:21:23,330
Show your teacher a classroom of true assassins!
