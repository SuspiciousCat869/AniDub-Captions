1
00:00:02,452 --> 00:00:04,410
Oh! Hey there, Big Teach!

2
00:00:04,493 --> 00:00:05,493
Long time no see!

3
00:00:05,635 --> 00:00:06,718
I know, right?

4
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:08,225
Thank goodness for payday!

5
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:14,218
Your one-stop shop for cheap, delicious junk food.

6
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:16,771
Well worth the trouble of going incognito.

7
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:18,160
Hey, cut it out!

8
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:18,637
Eh?

9
00:00:19,184 --> 00:00:21,067
Lighten up, doll face.

10
00:00:21,093 --> 00:00:24,151
Please, I don't have time for this,
my students are expecting me.

11
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:26,057
So you're a teacher, are ya?

12
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:28,991
What would you say to a li'l private tutoring
to help get our grades up?

13
00:00:29,016 --> 00:00:32,033
Allow me to tutor you gentlemen
on how to flirt with a lady.

14
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:34,565
Lesson 1: First Impressions.

15
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,594
Know what your wheels say about your game.

16
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:39,760
Why did you use pink?!

17
00:00:39,843 --> 00:00:41,147
There is no Lesson Two.

18
00:00:42,118 --> 00:00:43,280
Are you all right?

19
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,160
Who says chivalry is dead?

20
00:00:46,243 --> 00:00:47,885
You're a prince among men.

21
00:00:48,202 --> 00:00:50,705
Thank you. I'll remember this kindness always.

22
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,181
By the way...

23
00:00:52,827 --> 00:00:55,285
I'm trying to find Kunugigaoka Junior High.

24
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:56,620
Do you know where it is?

25
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:32,978
Okay. Look alive, people.

26
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:35,684
Meet our newest addition to the E Class faculty.

27
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:38,963
My name is Ms. Irina Jelavic.

28
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:40,617
Nice to meet you all!

29
00:02:41,013 --> 00:02:42,660
Talk about a knockout!

30
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:43,993
Knockers, more like.

31
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:45,785
Does anybody else think it's weird.

32
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:47,660
She's all over Koro-sensei?

33
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:48,958
Little bit, yeah.

34
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:50,587
Oh, you're adorable!

35
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:54,743
We decided to bring on Ms. Jelavic in the interest
of beefing up the English curriculum.

36
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:58,743
No hard feelings, I hope. She's, uh, very qualified.

37
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:00,278
No harm in that, is there?

38
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:03,338
She totally has a thing for Koro-sensei.

39
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:06,927
I mean, she seems nice, so...
I guess it's kinda cute, right?

40
00:03:07,177 --> 00:03:11,093
Mm-hm. Might be something we can use
to figure out how to kill him, too.

41
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:14,589
He seems thrown off by the attention she's giving him.

42
00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:17,202
Is it because she's human, or because she's a woman?

43
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:20,459
His face changes color to reflect his mood.

44
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,924
So what's the color for hot and bothered?

45
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:29,035
He is all about her.

46
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:31,392
Yeah. No mistaking that face.

47
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:33,790
Note: Attracted to human women.

48
00:03:36,035 --> 00:03:38,035
Ahh... The more I look at you,

49
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:41,952
the more I feel myself drawn
in. Those tiny, suppository eyes.

50
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:44,052
Those gelatinous joints.

51
00:03:44,077 --> 00:03:46,495
I'm simply captivated by the whole package!

52
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,202
Oh, my. I, uh...

53
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,035
Don't fall for it, she's trouble!

54
00:03:50,118 --> 00:03:52,405
No woman in her right mind would be into you.

55
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:55,452
He might be a sucker for those looks.

56
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:58,737
But we know there's more going on here than meets the eye.

57
00:03:59,077 --> 00:04:02,968
If she's here, odds are it's not just to
"beef up" our English studies.

58
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,064
Let's see you pass the ball! Come on!

59
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:09,441
And of course I had all the usual close-range tricks
at the ready.

60
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:13,657
Apparently the art of seduction works just as well
on whatever the hell he is.

61
00:04:18,865 --> 00:04:21,849
Irina Jelavic. First-rate assassin.

62
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:25,785
Beautiful. Intelligent. Athletic.

63
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:27,653
Fluent in a dozen languages.

64
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:30,275
No target is immune to her charms,

65
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:34,160
whatever their nationality, however well-guarded.

66
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:38,179
She wrote the book on infiltration and approach.

67
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:44,671
As good as you are, we can't just drop you
into this and expect the usual tricks to work.

68
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,827
I know deep cover is your specialty.

69
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,382
But this time you'll actually have to actually teach.

70
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:52,218
Hah. As if I'll be here long enough.

71
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:53,529
I'm a professional.

72
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:56,035
The octopus'll be pushing up daisies before lunch.

73
00:04:57,127 --> 00:04:57,889
Heads up!

74
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:01,234
Pass and kill!

75
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,910
Nope. Pass.

76
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:05,827
Pass and kill! Huh?

77
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:06,840
Try again. Pass!

78
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:07,614
Yoo-hoo!

79
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:10,825
Hope I'm not interrupting anything, darling!

80
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,702
Mr. Karasuma tells me you can go Mach 20

81
00:05:13,785 --> 00:05:15,885
and I just had to see it with my own eyes!

82
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,368
Well, he might've been exaggerating a tad.

83
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,285
I hate to ask this, but...

84
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:23,910
I would be ever so grateful if you could fetch
some Vietnamese coffee.

85
00:05:23,993 --> 00:05:26,160
I thought maybe you could grab it while I run the students

86
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,658
through their English lesson.

87
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:29,056
But of course, mon cher!

88
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:32,217
It just so happens I know a fabulous cafe in Vietnam.

89
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,030
Ah. It's about that time, Ms. Irina.

90
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,960
I mean, that's the bell.

91
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:46,082
Shouldn't we head back?

92
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,343
Sure, whatever. Knock yourselves out.

93
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:51,055
Teacher needs peace and quiet,
though, so make it a Study Hall.

94
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,551
And another thing.

95
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:57,991
Let's agree not to call me "Ms."
when the octopus isn't around.

96
00:05:58,795 --> 00:06:02,709
And we're definitely not on a
first name basis. So drop it.

97
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:05,878
When he is around, call me Ms. Jelavic.

98
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:11,036
Heh. So what's your game, Ms. Jela-bitch?

99
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:12,332
No nicknames!

100
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:14,243
We got ourselves a real pro here.

101
00:06:14,351 --> 00:06:16,971
Just a word of warning from those
who've been playin' the odds.

102
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:19,680
You're not gonna kill the octopus without help.

103
00:06:19,705 --> 00:06:21,910
Please, sweetheart. You're a bunch of saplings.

104
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:24,582
Adults have their own way of doing things, take note.

105
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,299
Speaking of which, you're Nagisa Shiota, right?

106
00:06:38,052 --> 00:06:40,345
Do me a fav, show me what you've got on him.

107
00:06:40,452 --> 00:06:42,118
Grab your special little notebook;

108
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,540
meet me in the faculty lounge in ten minutes.

109
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,010
That goes for any of you snot-nosed punks
who feel like you've got intel worth sharing.

110
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:50,992
Give Ms. Jelavich something useful.

111
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:54,090
and I'll let you go home while these gentlemen
stand in for you.

112
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:58,542
This is what separates the pros
from the amateurs, boys and girls,

113
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:01,159
connections and a little thing
we like to call "technique."

114
00:07:01,284 --> 00:07:03,475
Now. Piss off. Go play.

115
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,925
Oh, and a word of warning from
those of us who know our job.

116
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:08,925
Get in the way, you die.

117
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:11,832
That seductive, femme fatale kiss.

118
00:07:12,118 --> 00:07:13,977
Her, shady-looking companions.

119
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:16,155
The weight of her off-handed threat.

120
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:20,141
Clearly we're not dealing with
a teacher, but a genuine pro.

121
00:07:20,618 --> 00:07:24,050
Which, all things considered, would be sort of cool

122
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,705
if she wasn't, you know, such a bitch.

123
00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:38,820
This assignment is the first in which my objective
is to kill an unidentified creature.

124
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:40,974
Everything should be in order, though.

125
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:44,428
The kid's intel has given me a lot to work with.

126
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,283
A couple of us have actually gotten as far as destroying
one of his tentacles,

127
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:52,827
but he just dodges
your next attack while he lets it grow back.

128
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,993
I dunno. Maybe he can only be killed
if all his tentacles are destroyed at once?

129
00:07:57,285 --> 00:07:58,937
Good luck hitting more than one, though.

130
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:02,006
Also. If your plan is to sneak up on him,

131
00:08:02,144 --> 00:08:03,696
you probably don't wanna smoke.

132
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:04,307
Huh...?

133
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:05,626
Hello there, children!

134
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,930
For a guy without a nose,

135
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:08,572
he's a bloodhound.

136
00:08:09,742 --> 00:08:11,148
This'll be a piece of cake.

137
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:12,745
My strategy is airtight.

138
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,160
I am the one and only Irina Jelavic. The Closer.

139
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,451
The Go-to gal. I walk between the raindrops,
slip between...

140
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:21,452
Ms. Jelabitch, ma'am?

141
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:22,868
Are you gonna teach us, or what?

142
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:24,557
Yeah. C'mon, Ms. Jelabitch.

143
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:27,378
No disrespect, but you are a teacher,
aren't you, Ms. Jelabitch?

144
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:29,865
Ix-nay on the bitching!

145
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:32,327
The name is JelaVIC, understand?

146
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:36,611
JelaBITCH is what I'll be if you don't get the difference
through your thick, prepubescent skulls!

147
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:39,495
Let's review! My name is Jelavic.

148
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:42,635
"Jela-V!-vic!" Bite your lower lip and hum!

149
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:43,530
Vvv...

150
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,240
"V," excellent!

151
00:08:45,946 --> 00:08:49,302
Now practice that sound quietly for the next hour
while I ignore you.

152
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,475
Lamest. Lesson. Ever.

153
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:55,488
I understand you've brought in a rather questionable trio.

154
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,052
Why wasn't I made aware of this change of plan?

155
00:08:58,077 --> 00:09:00,677
Ah! Don't judge the books by their cover,

156
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:02,543
they're all consummate professionals.

157
00:09:02,788 --> 00:09:05,792
And so head-over-heels for me they'll do whatever I ask.

158
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:08,239
Now, sit back and enjoy the show.

159
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:10,130
It's almost go-time.

160
00:09:11,036 --> 00:09:12,633
I've returned, mademoiselle!

161
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:15,408
With the Indian chai you humbly requested.

162
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:17,153
Ah! You're amazing!

163
00:09:17,245 --> 00:09:20,370
My afternoon tea is going to be absolutely fabulous!

164
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,668
One more favor, though. Could we speak in private?

165
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,973
After fifth period? Like, maybe out in the shed?

166
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:27,822
Oh dear.

167
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:29,968
Well, how could I possibly say no?

168
00:09:29,993 --> 00:09:31,702
I'll be there with certain-tea!

169
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:34,719
Get it? Certain-tea? Because that's chai, you see.

170
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,169
Huh?

171
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,602
What? Oh, come on! You gotta be kidding me! Seriously?

172
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,900
Wow. He's really falling for it.

173
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,958
I can't look. You'd think he'd have more sense.

174
00:09:50,617 --> 00:09:51,841
Mr. Karasuma, sir?

175
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:52,388
Hm?

176
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,250
I get she's a pro, but she's
not exactly easy to get along with.

177
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:57,417
Yes, I know.

178
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,510
I'm sorry you kids have to deal with her,

179
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:01,502
but the higher-ups seem to think she's all that.

180
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:06,966
And, well, seeing what she's been able to put together
in such a short time...

181
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,736
does tend to make me agree with them.

182
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:14,468
So what is it you'd like to
speak in private about, Ms. Irina, darling?

183
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:16,447
Infiltration is an art.

184
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,466
One that requires flexibility, finesse.

185
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:21,137
He's mine.

186
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,636
I just have to act quickly, before he gets suspicious.

187
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:26,593
Oh, Koro-sensei, I just can't stand it!

188
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:30,048
You'll think I'm a harlot, but I simply can't
control myself around you!

189
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:32,677
Your body, your strength,

190
00:10:32,702 --> 00:10:35,643
everything about you drives me mad with longing!

191
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,349
Ah, well, yes... I mean, ah...

192
00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:39,593
Does that make me a bad woman?

193
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:40,804
Am I bad?

194
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,363
That's right.

195
00:10:42,618 --> 00:10:44,535
Keep those beady, little eyes on me.

196
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,939
Don't pay attention to your surroundings.

197
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,268
I spent all night fixing this place up.

198
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,850
All for you, dirty boy.

199
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,320
All for you.

200
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:04,515
This is what you want. You can't fool me.

201
00:11:04,993 --> 00:11:07,914
I, uh, really don't think we oughta do this here!

202
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:09,676
Goodbye, stupid.

203
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,101
It's been fun.

204
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:15,385
Don't be such a prude. Let me get these clothes off.

205
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,120
What?!

206
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,078
Relax, darling, I'll be au natural in a jiff.

207
00:11:20,103 --> 00:11:21,117
Au natural?

208
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:22,302
Whee-hee!

209
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:26,069
Live ammo. Big guns.

210
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:32,308
M61. M134. M249.

211
00:11:33,077 --> 00:11:36,676
Enough combined speed and firepower
to take out a small army.

212
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,478
Who needs BB's when you have the real thing?

213
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:40,615
I'm a pro.

214
00:11:40,855 --> 00:11:43,723
I'll stick with actual weapons, thank you very much.

215
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:50,285
And assignment complete in... three, two, one, zero.

216
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,680
A noble effort, madam,

217
00:11:56,772 --> 00:11:59,731
but lead bullets have no effect on me whatsoever.

218
00:12:00,715 --> 00:12:03,394
In fact, once inside my body, they melt.

219
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:08,160
Look closely at my face and tell me what you see.

220
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:11,447
You... You have four eyes?

221
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:13,885
No. Two of these holes are nostrils.

222
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,378
How am I supposed to know that?!

223
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:21,947
I noticed a distinct metallic odor in here
since yesterday. Along with the scent of adult man B.O.

224
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:25,037
The moment it hit me, I knew something wasn't right.

225
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,939
For a guy without a nose, he's a bloodhound.

226
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:33,902
So you see, I was simply pretending
to be ensnared by your little ruse.

227
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:35,669
Fun, but all for nothing.

228
00:12:36,327 --> 00:12:39,427
I've exposed you for the uncreative hack you are.

229
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:42,667
You could learn a thing or two from my students.

230
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:45,650
Their assassination attempts are much more imaginative.

231
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,245
Oh, and just out of curiosity.

232
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:54,172
Did the government dossier on me mention that
my preferred method of retaliation... is grooming?

233
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:57,351
Uh, what was that?

234
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,171
I heard gunfire, a scream and now slithering noise!

235
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:01,545
No!

236
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:05,493
No...

237
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:10,676
I really want to know what he's doing to her in there.

238
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:11,333
Let's go!

239
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:16,160
Koro-sensei!

240
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:17,368
Did you touch her boobs?!

241
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:21,010
If only I had the time to be really thorough.

242
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:23,655
But class isn't going to teach itself, is it, children?

243
00:13:24,106 --> 00:13:26,493
Um, what exactly went on in there, sir?

244
00:13:28,638 --> 00:13:32,221
Ms. Jelabitch has been stuffed into
a tastefully retro gym outfit!

245
00:13:32,705 --> 00:13:37,298
It would take longer for me to describe the things he did
to this body than it did for him to do them.

246
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,006
My back and shoulders have never felt looser.

247
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,733
He somehow worked in a lymphatic oil massage.

248
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:47,164
A change of clothes, just because.

249
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:52,114
And he still had time to do this thing with his tentacles.

250
00:13:52,555 --> 00:13:54,060
What thing with his tentacles?!

251
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:56,260
Koro-sensei, what is she talking about?

252
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:59,773
Uh. Adults sometimes need special care.

253
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,560
I don't trust that look.

254
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:04,186
Come now. Back to the classroom, boys and girls.

255
00:14:04,285 --> 00:14:05,390
Yes, sir.

256
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:07,487
Unbelievable.

257
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:10,673
I've never been so humiliated in all my life!

258
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:13,077
I am a professional, damn it!

259
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,592
The octopus will pay!

260
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:27,033
If he thinks I'm out of ideas,
that yellow, wiggly monstrosity has another thing coming!

261
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:29,107
I just need fresh supplies!

262
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:32,048
Oh, come on! What's with the Wi-Fi in this place?!

263
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:33,252
Are we on Mars?!

264
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:36,041
Wow. Looks like Ms. Jelabitch is pissed off.

265
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,053
I know my pride would be in shambles
if my plan had gone tits up.

266
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:41,150
Excuse me, Miss?

267
00:14:41,175 --> 00:14:42,285
Ugh. What?

268
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:46,343
If you're not actually going to teach us anything,
you mind if we swap you out for Koro-sensei?

269
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:48,593
It's just, we've got entrance exams coming up, and...

270
00:14:48,676 --> 00:14:52,210
Hah! You wanna swap me out for that disgusting creature?!

271
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:55,424
You're worried about entrance exams
when the planet is on notice?!

272
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,542
Must be paradise not knowing
your ass from a hole in the ground.

273
00:14:58,687 --> 00:14:59,542
Give it a rest.

274
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,838
Even if the Earth wasn't on the brink of destruction,

275
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,346
entrance exams are for students with a future.

276
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:07,757
News flash: that's not any of you losers.

277
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:09,343
How 'bout this, kids?

278
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,618
Forget the "studying."

279
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:13,077
Help me brainstorm on how to kill the octopus

280
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,660
and I'll give you a nice percentage of the reward money.

281
00:15:15,754 --> 00:15:19,175
That's the best deal any of you E Class jerkoffs
are gonna get out of life.

282
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:21,716
Otherwise, knock it off with the whining and let...

283
00:15:22,685 --> 00:15:23,296
Get out.

284
00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:24,521
Ah?

285
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,743
Now, you're just a plain ol' bitch!

286
00:15:30,827 --> 00:15:31,681
We want Koro-sensei back!

287
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:34,706
That's it! I will make you rue the day you were born!

288
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:36,593
Yeah! Go ahead, we dare you, bitch!

289
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:38,820
Your boobs are way too big to be a teacher!

290
00:15:38,845 --> 00:15:39,704
Seriously?!

291
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:45,030
Someone oughta slap the piss out of them!

292
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:48,079
I am too fine a woman to be one-upped by a bunch of punks!

293
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:50,342
They'd be lucky to lick the mud off my stilettos!

294
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:51,788
In case you haven't noticed, sweetheart,

295
00:15:51,813 --> 00:15:54,045
the children don't exactly agree with that assessment.

296
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,475
If you're gonna stick around for another attempt,

297
00:15:56,674 --> 00:15:58,818
I suggest you suck it up, march in there

298
00:15:58,843 --> 00:16:00,050
and give them an apology.

299
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:00,870
Do what?!

300
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:04,135
I am an accomplished assassin,
not a glorified rugrat wrangler!

301
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,136
Let me focus on what I'm qualified for!

302
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:09,915
Oh, fine. Whatever. Just come with me, please.

303
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:13,452
Erromango. One of the islands of Vanuatu,

304
00:16:13,535 --> 00:16:15,135
otherwise known as the New Hebrides.

305
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:17,283
Okay. So exactly what the hell is he doing?

306
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:19,572
Poring over and writing out test questions.

307
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:22,893
He's done this every Wednesday during sixth period
since I've been here.

308
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:26,993
Quick as the bastard is,
you wouldn't think it'd take him so long.

309
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:30,827
I mean, at Mach 20, I'd imagine the tests would be
written out and ready to go by now.

310
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:33,277
They're tailored to each individual student.

311
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,295
He takes into account which subjects they're good at,

312
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,703
where they need improvement,

313
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,419
and hands out a test designed specifically for them.

314
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:44,991
No denying that Chibahas spatial relations down pat.

315
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:48,690
Let's give him a problem
that'll really kick-start his lateral thinking.

316
00:16:48,952 --> 00:16:51,105
His IQ is off the charts, literally.

317
00:16:51,702 --> 00:16:53,950
His speed puts every weapon we have to shame.

318
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:58,564
He's dangerous, contradictory,
and a damn-near perfect teacher.

319
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,569
Ha-ha!

320
00:17:00,993 --> 00:17:03,187
Take a look at the kids. Tell me what you see.

321
00:17:03,212 --> 00:17:05,390
Huh? They're just screwing around.

322
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:10,257
They're fine-tuning the necessary
hand-eye coordination skills to hit a moving target.

323
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:11,199
I call it,

324
00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:12,868
Assassination Badminton.

325
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:13,398
What?

326
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:14,351
Three points!

327
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:16,829
Everyone has two roles here.

328
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:19,733
Assassin and student. Teacher and target.

329
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:22,392
It's a bizarre classroom this creature's created,

330
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:25,578
not a place for easy answers or tidy resolutions.

331
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:28,962
Or one where we can afford to fit ourselves
into simple categories.

332
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:32,249
I understand wanting to take pride in yourself
as a professional,

333
00:17:32,848 --> 00:17:36,191
but if you can't cut it
as both assassin and teacher, you're toast.

334
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:39,648
Nice return.

335
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:40,690
Yeah. Whatever.

336
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:45,663
You wanna stay here, keep at it, fine. Be my guest.

337
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:47,812
Just treat those kids with respect.

338
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:08,702
What word does "incredible" modify?

339
00:18:08,785 --> 00:18:09,656
You know this one.

340
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:12,262
Read it aloud.

341
00:18:12,535 --> 00:18:16,075
"Y... You are incredible in bed."

342
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:19,159
I was once took out an American VIP.

343
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:23,584
Literally. I had my feminine grace to thank
for getting me close to the target.

344
00:18:23,993 --> 00:18:26,207
The poor dupe fell for me hook, line, and sinker.

345
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,632
"You are incredible in bed," he told me.

346
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,079
Incredible, in this case, modifies the word you.

347
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:35,202
That's the example you use with Junior High kids?!

348
00:18:35,285 --> 00:18:37,917
To learn grammar, you've got to see how it works
in the real world.

349
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:40,327
Like a full immersion course in a foreign language.

350
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,200
Take a lover that speaks it and you can't miss.

351
00:18:42,702 --> 00:18:44,861
I know grammar seems boring and technical,

352
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:47,197
but it's what underpins how we communicate.

353
00:18:48,366 --> 00:18:51,239
Communication is key in my line of work, and in life.

354
00:18:51,406 --> 00:18:54,275
Whether speaking English, French, Portuguese,
what have you,

355
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,743
all peoplehave an underlying need
to express their feelings. That's why this is important.

356
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:01,771
The examples may be risqué, but they come from

357
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,868
real-life scenarios. They will
all have either been said by me,

358
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:06,368
or to me by someone else.

359
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,562
One day, you might use or hear them yourselves.

360
00:19:08,702 --> 00:19:10,516
Communication.

361
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,993
Don't expect me to be like the octopus.

362
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:14,989
He can help you with your entrance exams.

363
00:19:15,144 --> 00:19:17,061
Which isn't without value, I suppose.

364
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,698
All I can do is help you learn the art of conversation.

365
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,051
Here's the deal:

366
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:23,235
If after a while, you think this is stupid,

367
00:19:23,285 --> 00:19:24,920
that I'm not a teacher, fine.

368
00:19:25,202 --> 00:19:27,072
I'll give up my assignment and leave.

369
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,833
So, this oughta put us on the level, right?

370
00:19:31,993 --> 00:19:35,502
Oh, and... I'm sorry about being... such a bitch.

371
00:19:41,487 --> 00:19:43,118
Wow. Talk about a one-eighty.

372
00:19:43,202 --> 00:19:45,952
First, you wanna kill us, now you're acting like a wuss.

373
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,898
I gotta say, you make a more convincing teacher
with this attitude.

374
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:51,506
Guess this means we shouldn't
call you Ms. Jelabitch anymore.

375
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:53,822
You're giving me a chance?

376
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,419
You're not upset with me?

377
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,952
To be totally fair, we didn't exactly get off

378
00:19:58,035 --> 00:19:59,327
on the right foot with that nickname.

379
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:00,353
Maybe not.

380
00:20:00,378 --> 00:20:01,991
But we've got to call her something.

381
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:03,761
How 'bout "Ms. Hellabitch"?

382
00:20:05,765 --> 00:20:10,547
Uh... Or... We could just agree to move away
from the whole bitch motif altogether.

383
00:20:10,703 --> 00:20:13,723
I'm not opposed to going by Irina if you guys don't mind
calling a teacher by...

384
00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:17,206
Yeah, I'm sorry. I wouldn't plan on
the bitch thing going away any time soon.

385
00:20:17,755 --> 00:20:20,452
Mm-hm! Not that Ms. Irina isn't a pretty name,

386
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,393
it's just not as fun to say as Hellabitch.

387
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:24,109
Professor Bitch sounds classy.

388
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:25,177
How 'bout we do that?

389
00:20:25,202 --> 00:20:26,284
I vote for that one.

390
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:27,562
Professor Bitch all the way.

391
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:31,450
I hate you little turds so much!

392
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:34,706
She seems to be settling in nicely.

393
00:20:35,257 --> 00:20:36,606
Eh. More or less.

394
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,952
Do you know who you're messing with?!

395
00:20:40,035 --> 00:20:41,312
I will end you!

396
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,273
Thank you for bringing a new teacher, Mr. Karasuma.

397
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:50,554
She's a bit rough around the edges, perhaps, but
a welcome addition to our little family, I think.

398
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:56,710
Who better to spruce up the language arts syllabus
than a globe-trotting assassin-slash-temptress like her?

399
00:20:57,327 --> 00:20:58,341
Impossible.

400
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:00,422
There's no way you've coulda seen this coming.

401
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:02,785
If you'll excuse me, mental gymnasts...

402
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:06,985
Whenever he's pressed to say why
he started teaching E Class, he dodges the question.

403
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,005
But whatever his reasons, he's not only turned it into
the perfect training ground for assassins.

404
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:15,052
It may just be the perfect training ground for life.

405
00:21:15,077 --> 00:21:16,618
You're so adorable when you're mad.

406
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:17,462
No, I am not!

407
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,384
Bastard's got us all wrapped around his tentacles.

408
00:21:20,827 --> 00:21:22,212
He knows what he's doing.

409
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:23,690
No doubt about it.
