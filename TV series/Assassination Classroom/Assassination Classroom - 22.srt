1
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:20,802
You monster. I'll kill you for what you've done!

2
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:24,116
That's the spirit, boy!

3
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:28,380
Show me your kill face! Come
at me with everything you've got!

4
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:09,034
It's happened. Nagisa snapped.

5
00:02:09,352 --> 00:02:11,079
All right, let's be honest here for a second.

6
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:14,635
Sure, we all wanna kill him. But, Nagisa might do it.

7
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:16,509
Can't say I saw it comin'.

8
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,921
No. Someone has to stop this!

9
00:02:27,044 --> 00:02:29,125
Get over yourself, dumb-ass!

10
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:32,913
Yeah, don't think I missed the look you gave me

11
00:02:32,996 --> 00:02:34,371
when he blew up the antidote!

12
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,814
Screw your pity!

13
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:42,084
Quit wastin' your energy worryin' about what's
goin' on with other people and focus on you!

14
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:46,454
Look, the virus is a lie! I'll be
fine! He's playin' you for an idiot!

15
00:02:46,643 --> 00:02:48,924
What are you saying? Are you sick?

16
00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:50,465
Murder is murder!

17
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:53,427
Even with a piece of shit like this evil son of a bitch.

18
00:02:53,594 --> 00:02:54,589
He's not worth it!

19
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:57,537
Give in to the bloodlust and you're no better than him!

20
00:02:58,538 --> 00:03:00,079
He's absolutely right, Nagisa.

21
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:02,871
Listen to him. Killing this man won't solve anything.

22
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,497
Blind rage is not a moral guide!

23
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:09,346
In any event, he's likely bluffing about the antidote.

24
00:03:09,573 --> 00:03:11,996
We need only consult the poisoner downstairs.

25
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,953
Do not stoop to Takaoka's level.
Simply render him unconscious.

26
00:03:16,804 --> 00:03:17,984
Shut your damn mouth.

27
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:19,801
You're takin' all the fun out of everything!

28
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:23,538
If we're gonna get the most out of this,
he's gotta come at me with intent to kill!

29
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,883
Part of the process is bloodlust unbound!

30
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,672
He has to feel it or I can't properly humiliate him!

31
00:03:28,893 --> 00:03:31,496
How the hell else am I gonna patch-up my self-esteem?

32
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:32,871
Nagisa, please.

33
00:03:32,982 --> 00:03:34,595
Take up Terasaka's stun gun.

34
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,836
Heed the words of a friend before
you give credence to an enemy.

35
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:43,470
Resist the anger. Weigh your options.

36
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,710
Ask what within myself does this man have claim on?

37
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,429
Terasaka! What the...

38
00:03:50,454 --> 00:03:52,163
You're as hot as a combustion engine!

39
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:54,457
Dude, how'd you make it so far like this?

40
00:03:54,805 --> 00:03:58,796
Who cares? Don't look at me. Look at them.

41
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:01,584
The octopus is half right.

42
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:05,326
You ain't gotta resist the anger. You control it.

43
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:06,891
Uh!

44
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:24,116
Ooh! Oh, ho! Don't we look vicious!

45
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:25,663
Question, sir?

46
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,913
Why did Nagisa put the stun gun away?

47
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,329
So you're opting for the knife. Good on you, kid!

48
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:35,954
I knew you'd see the light. Do
you wanna know a little secret?

49
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,402
I didn't blow up every vial of the antidote.

50
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,829
Now, either you come at me and
your pals keep a respectful distance,

51
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:45,079
or what's left of their chance at survival goes bye-bye.

52
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:47,370
Everyone infected will die.

53
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:51,731
Hear that, Karasuma? It's just me and the boy!

54
00:04:53,062 --> 00:04:56,117
This stuff takes a month to
cook up under ideal conditions.

55
00:04:56,222 --> 00:04:58,263
Now sure, there's not enough for everyone.

56
00:04:58,476 --> 00:05:00,941
But saving some's better than saving none.

57
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:05,459
Mr. Karasuma. I hate to ask this of you, but...

58
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,763
If at any moment you believe
Nagisa's life to be in jeopardy,

59
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,043
please do not hesitate to shoot Takaoka.

60
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:14,788
He usually has a sixth sense
about where things are headed.

61
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:17,423
So for him to ask me that, we're in trouble.

62
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:18,606
Deep trouble.

63
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:21,363
Of course we are.

64
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:23,597
Even I can see the writing on the wall.

65
00:05:24,287 --> 00:05:28,198
We got the better of three professional
freelance assassins on our own terms.

66
00:05:28,635 --> 00:05:32,321
But this is different. Here, we're playing by his rules.

67
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:37,906
Nagisa has absolutely no idea
the world of hurt he's in for.

68
00:05:43,904 --> 00:05:45,277
Ha! That all you've got?

69
00:05:45,396 --> 00:05:48,487
Where's that homicidal rage now
you're on your ass, you little snot rag?

70
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:52,015
Takaoka is a man possessed.

71
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,851
He's in battle mode.

72
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:58,109
Years of elite military training cut through the insanity.

73
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:01,866
No attack is going to slip through his defenses.

74
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:09,603
His physique. His skills. His experience.

75
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:17,303
This isn't like scoring high on the finals.

76
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:19,486
This is life or death.

77
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:21,763
Ugh. So not a fair match.

78
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:24,538
Yeah, no kidding, right? He doesn't have a prayer!

79
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,388
Aw. Hey now, don't peter out.

80
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:28,832
We're just getting started.

81
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:32,207
That's right.

82
00:06:32,538 --> 00:06:35,497
We haven't yet incorporated this old girl into the mix.

83
00:06:37,993 --> 00:06:40,964
This knife comes to me in my dreams every night.

84
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:43,990
Hand in hand with that smile.

85
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:47,883
The precise moment my peace of mind flew off the rails.

86
00:06:48,986 --> 00:06:52,937
Well, tonight I won't give that
smug little pipsqueak the satisfaction!

87
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:56,829
I'll split you from groin to grin and savor the screams.

88
00:06:56,968 --> 00:07:00,879
I'll sever your hands and feet and
mount them above my mantle like trophies!

89
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,902
Shoot him, Mr. K! Please! Nagisa will die!

90
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:06,068
That man means every word of what he says!

91
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,428
Stop. Let Nagisa handle it.

92
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:11,382
Dude. Do you see the shape he's in?

93
00:07:11,987 --> 00:07:14,788
At least if I was in there
Takaoka wouldn't have it so easy.

94
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:16,014
You think so?

95
00:07:16,587 --> 00:07:17,829
Shows what you know.

96
00:07:17,913 --> 00:07:20,371
If you didn't ditch training so much you'd have a clue.

97
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,663
This fight ain't over yet, pal. Just watch.

98
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,996
He's about to pull out the big guns.

99
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:29,746
This technique. It never fails?

100
00:07:29,946 --> 00:07:32,413
Don't be fooled. It only looks easy.

101
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:34,474
Therein lies the beauty.

102
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,488
I've used it many a time in field.

103
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,329
Nothing compares for getting out of pinch.

104
00:07:40,871 --> 00:07:44,454
The technique only works under
certain conditions, however.

105
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:46,947
Three criteria must be met.

106
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:50,871
First, have at least two weapons ready-hand.

107
00:07:51,534 --> 00:07:54,980
Second, you must be pitted against an expert.

108
00:07:55,535 --> 00:07:57,419
Third, and most important,

109
00:07:57,586 --> 00:08:01,026
your opponent must already
know what it means to face death.

110
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:04,489
Excellent. We're three for three.

111
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:08,430
What the...

112
00:08:08,926 --> 00:08:11,148
Congratulations, Mr. Takaoka.

113
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:13,656
You get to be my beta test.

114
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:18,385
What is he doing?

115
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,871
You must understand the nature of this move.

116
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:24,098
It's something of a paradox, you see.

117
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,579
Conditions aren't often favorable.

118
00:08:26,655 --> 00:08:30,788
And while I call it an "insta-kill"
technique, in all honesty that is a misnomer.

119
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:33,746
Employing it doesn't mean your
opponent will die instantly.

120
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:36,731
Particularly when their defenses are impregnable.

121
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:40,663
That said, if you find yourself painted into a corner,

122
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,387
and at some point you will,

123
00:08:42,843 --> 00:08:46,780
do this correctly and it sets
the stage for an instant kill.

124
00:08:47,084 --> 00:08:49,561
That sounds pretty useful. How's it work?

125
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,531
From a standstill position, move quickly.

126
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:55,607
As far as you can, as loudly as you can.

127
00:08:56,974 --> 00:08:59,667
Come on! Do it!

128
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:03,830
Careful. Time it just after dropping the knife.

129
00:09:04,203 --> 00:09:07,193
The closer I get, the more focused he'll be on the blade.

130
00:09:09,743 --> 00:09:12,451
Drop my weapon, and his attention follows it.

131
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,786
Both caught in midair for just a fraction of a second.

132
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,447
What the hell was that?

133
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:42,013
There it is!

134
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:44,621
An assassin slips through the cracks.

135
00:09:44,905 --> 00:09:48,726
And in that tiny moment, out
comes the crucial second blade.

136
00:09:52,485 --> 00:09:54,812
No! This isn't happening!

137
00:09:56,617 --> 00:10:00,493
The runt... got me... again!

138
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:06,586
Whoa.

139
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:17,455
Way to go. That's how it's done.

140
00:10:18,147 --> 00:10:20,409
One good jolt and he'll be out like a light bulb.

141
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:22,888
Taze the psychotic rat-bastard.

142
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:35,417
This man taught me bloodlust.

143
00:10:36,087 --> 00:10:39,509
Taught me that sometimes anger is good, sometimes not.

144
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,777
He taught me the importance of having
friends to pull you out of your own head.

145
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:46,342
I know what it's like to be hit.

146
00:10:47,057 --> 00:10:50,546
To be in a real fight. All because of this man.

147
00:10:51,707 --> 00:10:55,225
He's done some awful things. There's no denying that.

148
00:10:55,878 --> 00:10:59,040
But in a weird way, he does deserve my respect.

149
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:03,369
He's a teacher.

150
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:05,434
Please. No.

151
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:08,240
I've learned something about myself in all this.

152
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:10,871
Whatever you're about to do,

153
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:15,704
don't do it with that look on your face! Oh, god!

154
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:20,117
I'll be haunted by that smile till
the day they put me in the ground!

155
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,338
Mr. Takaoka. Thank you, for everything.

156
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:45,585
Yeah!

157
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,579
We beat the final boss!

158
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:10,765
Nice work.

159
00:12:11,753 --> 00:12:13,087
Are you okay, Nagisa?

160
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:14,007
Sure.

161
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:17,161
Well done, Nagisa. I'm proud of you.

162
00:12:17,426 --> 00:12:21,166
For the first time in a while I
had no idea how this would end.

163
00:12:21,413 --> 00:12:23,871
Thanks. But what are we going to do now?

164
00:12:23,954 --> 00:12:26,569
Everybody else is still infected with the virus.

165
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:29,857
The antidote Takaoka didn't blow up isn't enough.

166
00:12:31,756 --> 00:12:33,591
We'll figure something out, but first.

167
00:12:33,804 --> 00:12:36,846
Let's get out off this roof. Wait here for the chopper.

168
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:38,222
I'll go collect Smog.

169
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:43,273
Ha! Please. The antidote won't do you any good.

170
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,833
Look at you brats.

171
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:48,072
You really figured on getting out
of this situation with your lives!

172
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,038
The man who hired you has been defeated.

173
00:12:50,256 --> 00:12:53,148
Let it go. You've no longer have a dog in this fight.

174
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:53,981
Heh.

175
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:56,778
I'm almost fully recovered from the gas.

176
00:12:57,004 --> 00:12:58,947
And these kids are strong. Believe me.

177
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:02,879
I suggest we be reasonable and stop
this before anyone else gets hurt.

178
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:04,492
Yeah. All right.

179
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,396
I'll make you wish you hadn't... Wait.

180
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:07,570
Come again?

181
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,663
No worries. You don't have to bother with us.

182
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:11,835
Our contracts don't cover avenging our employer.

183
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,416
Anyway, as I was saying.

184
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:16,579
The antidote would only be useful to
you if you'd actually been poisoned.

185
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:17,243
Huh?

186
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:20,288
Well, technically you were, but not that bad.

187
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:23,246
You know that bug you can get
eating oysters on the half-shell?

188
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:25,621
I gave you a perfected version of that ol' warhorse.

189
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,496
It ought to flush out of your
systems in about 30 hours or so.

190
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:30,121
Unpleasant, but not fatal.

191
00:13:30,204 --> 00:13:33,105
Now, this sucker is what our boss wanted us to use.

192
00:13:33,908 --> 00:13:36,902
If I actually had, heh, different story altogether.

193
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:41,042
After we got the job, the three of
us talked it over, and hatched a plan.

194
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,913
The boss's idea, you know it, seemed too harsh.

195
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:47,795
We figured the handoff would play out just
as well if you only thought you were in danger.

196
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:53,254
And a bout a food poisoning certainly makes
you feel like death warmed over, so win-win.

197
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:55,971
Since when does a hired killer have scruples?

198
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:58,746
Isn't going against your client bad for the bottom line?

199
00:13:58,829 --> 00:13:59,633
Sweetheart.

200
00:13:59,786 --> 00:14:03,233
We take pride in what we do,
but money isn't the end-all be-all.

201
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,554
A client's needs are always considered carefully,

202
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,134
and we do aim to please.

203
00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:10,001
We blow the antidote up.

204
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:13,179
Right in front of their shocked, bedraggled little faces!

205
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:16,374
How sweet the moment will be when all hope is lost!

206
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,584
But when we realized he never
intended on giving you the antidote.

207
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:25,621
It was either we try to live with ourselves after
having offed a bunch of innocent junior high kids.

208
00:14:25,877 --> 00:14:27,806
Or we take out a hit on our reputation.

209
00:14:28,263 --> 00:14:31,118
Seemed like a fairly
straightforward, ethical decision to us.

210
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:33,829
And there's always a way to bounce back if you're clever.

211
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:37,429
So, guess this job was a wash.

212
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,038
But at least none of you are going to
die because we don't having scruples.

213
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:42,288
Here, give that supplement to your buddies.

214
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:44,037
And make sure they get plenty of rest.

215
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:47,153
They'll probably wind up feeling better
than they did before this all started.

216
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:50,051
Thank you, gentlemen.

217
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,329
But I'll believe it after I've seen those
kids make a full recovery. In the meantime,

218
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:57,274
I'm afraid it's protocol to detain you for questioning.

219
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:59,323
Uh. Yeah, okay.

220
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:02,994
If you wouldn't mind making it quick so we
can move on the next job, that'd be great.

221
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:05,175
You disappoint me.

222
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,621
Mm?

223
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,366
I thought you'd at least want a
grudge match between the two of us.

224
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:11,795
You're a samurai. Isn't your
honor threatened by hot-sauce?

225
00:15:12,265 --> 00:15:15,451
Part of the samurai code is
not to kill people out of spite.

226
00:15:16,843 --> 00:15:22,896
I'm content to wait for the day someone puts a price
on your head, Hun. Because it'll happen. Guarantee it.

227
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:25,638
Let this be a lesson to you.

228
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:28,578
You wanna rematch? Make it to the big-time.

229
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:30,163
Become a worthy target!

230
00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:32,496
Then we'll come back

231
00:15:32,828 --> 00:15:36,084
and give you all the assassination grand tour!

232
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:45,324
And just like that, they're gone.

233
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:47,413
Not sure if what they left us with

234
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:48,964
was a warning or a compliment.

235
00:15:51,757 --> 00:15:52,394
Oh!

236
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:54,704
A single buzz from Karasuma.

237
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:56,526
That's the signal they've made it out.

238
00:15:57,396 --> 00:16:00,562
Boys. I have the sudden urge to walk naked by the ocean.

239
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,581
Would one of you be kind enough to drive me to a beach?

240
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:05,830
That's it.

241
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:08,348
Our big infiltration mission is over.

242
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,329
And no one, not the other guests, not the staff,

243
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:12,578
suspects a thing.

244
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:14,895
Hey, Terasaka?

245
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:15,547
Hm?

246
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:20,935
I owe you big time. I was on the verge of
a bad choice. So thanks for yelling at me.

247
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:26,256
Heh. It's hard enough to kill the octopus
without one of us being taken out of the equation.

248
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:30,755
Yeah. Guess so.

249
00:16:32,852 --> 00:16:35,759
So now, we go back to our hotel.

250
00:16:36,364 --> 00:16:38,032
Tell the others they're gonna be fine.

251
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:44,328
Then we put this whole day behind us and
catch up on our sleep because, seriously.

252
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:46,032
I am friggin' exhausted.

253
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:56,373
Oh, man. That was one crazy day, huh?

254
00:16:56,788 --> 00:16:58,735
I'm just glad we got through it okay.

255
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,541
And I'm just glad you knew how to handle yourself!

256
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,550
Uh! Me, too.

257
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:06,211
You're such a trouble magnet, Nagisa.

258
00:17:06,678 --> 00:17:08,236
You know we worry about you.

259
00:17:09,718 --> 00:17:11,926
Morning! Well, evening really.

260
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:13,785
So, how're you guys feeling?

261
00:17:13,926 --> 00:17:15,087
Great. Thanks!

262
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,371
School jerseys. Heh. You too, huh?

263
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,267
We're the only ones on the resort now.

264
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:20,566
Might as well be comfy.

265
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:24,205
Designing a new outfit for one just
one scene is too much of a pain anyway.

266
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,355
Who are you talking to?

267
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:27,496
So is Koro-Sensei really in there?

268
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,360
It won't work,

269
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,577
but at least he's under strict
supervision till he reverts back to normal.

270
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:33,080
Then back to the drawing board.

271
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:35,501
Mr. Karasuma's been orchestrating the whole thing.

272
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:38,457
I swear, does Mr. K ever sleep?

273
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,428
He's awesome! What's his secret?

274
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:43,328
'Cause if I can be like that
ten years from now, I'll be set.

275
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:44,940
Somethin' to shoot for.

276
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:47,433
Hey, Professor Bitch is pretty awesome, too,

277
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,750
if you look hard enough.

278
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:50,883
Same thing with the assassins at the hotel.

279
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:54,784
I mean, you've gotta admire the discipline
it takes to be that highly skilled.

280
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:58,106
And the philosophy. Not to mention the work ethic.

281
00:17:58,329 --> 00:17:59,097
True that.

282
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:02,546
Personally, as long as I don't grow
up to be like Takaoka, I'll be happy.

283
00:18:03,198 --> 00:18:05,604
In a way I suppose that's what growing up is.

284
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:07,913
Knowing who to look up to and who to ignore.

285
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,086
Sometimes the difference is night and day.

286
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:12,040
Sometimes, not so much.

287
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:17,897
Koro-Sensei exploded!

288
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:18,802
Did we get him?

289
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:21,082
Right.

290
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:23,958
As if we don't already know the answer to that question.

291
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:30,579
You've suffered in the shadow of my
cowardice, and I'm sorry. But consider!

292
00:18:30,838 --> 00:18:33,329
Not only have you faced an array of fearsome foes,

293
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:35,947
you did so with unquestionable style!

294
00:18:36,622 --> 00:18:37,853
Oh, there you are, sir.

295
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,620
Good to have you back. With all due respect

296
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:41,788
we like this form better.

297
00:18:41,963 --> 00:18:43,996
Indeed. And good morning to you.

298
00:18:44,274 --> 00:18:47,220
Now, what do you say we get this vacation back on track?

299
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:48,157
Sure!

300
00:18:48,234 --> 00:18:49,846
Yeah, I think it's a little late for that.

301
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:51,079
We go back tomorrow morning.

302
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:52,596
Are you kidding me?

303
00:18:52,956 --> 00:18:56,538
But... but... there's so much fun in the
sun to be had now that I'm fully mobile again!

304
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:57,842
Naturally.

305
00:18:58,249 --> 00:18:59,746
There's not a second to waste, children!

306
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:03,204
Summer Vacation with your Koro-Sensei
is a once-in-a-lifetime experience!

307
00:19:03,288 --> 00:19:05,057
We must milk it for all it's worth!

308
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,263
What are you doing, Karma?

309
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:08,579
Takin' your advice, Teach.

310
00:19:08,663 --> 00:19:10,038
Gotta strike when the iron's hot.

311
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:13,329
Well played, my boy.

312
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:15,114
Wait for the target to let his guar...

313
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:16,942
Now it's Summer Vacation!

314
00:19:16,974 --> 00:19:18,436
No time like the present, right?

315
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,121
Whaddya say, Nagisa? Feel like emptyin' a few rounds?

316
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:22,869
Well then, girls.

317
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:24,763
Who would we be if we didn't make the most of things?

318
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,579
Yay! Let's have fun!

319
00:19:29,938 --> 00:19:31,996
Y'know. I'm finally feeling up to a little dip.

320
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,663
Was that under your uniform?

321
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:35,096
No one told me!

322
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:37,049
Splash attack!

323
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,295
You can run, but you can't hide!

324
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:44,804
Yay! Splash attack! Me, too! Me, too!

325
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:45,703
Okay!

326
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:49,704
Actually, never mind!

327
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:51,513
Terrible idea! Thank you, no!

328
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:52,054
Aw.

329
00:19:52,078 --> 00:19:53,155
Well there goes that.

330
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,371
Yes! This is what I'm talkin' about!

331
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:56,882
This is how it should be!

332
00:19:57,121 --> 00:20:00,579
Here I come, ladies! Geronimo!

333
00:20:00,655 --> 00:20:01,347
Pervert!

334
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:02,413
Oh, shrinkage.

335
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:05,829
There's a fireworks display after
this! We don't want to miss it!

336
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:07,870
We have to keep to the itinerary!

337
00:20:08,354 --> 00:20:09,704
'Course that didn't work.

338
00:20:09,736 --> 00:20:10,848
Is that it, sir?

339
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:13,538
Should we pack in our demolition equipment and head out?

340
00:20:13,851 --> 00:20:15,397
Yeah. Might as well.

341
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:17,371
So, that's how it is, huh?

342
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:20,346
You're all suddenly too good to
include me on your day at the beach?

343
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,874
A girl's got feelings, you know!

344
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:23,072
I thought we were friends!

345
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:24,554
Is that a bikini?

346
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,665
Or a cry for help?

347
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,992
Ugh! Shut your pie-holes!

348
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,122
Hey let's ditch the brats, yeah? Just us?

349
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:32,737
I saw this adorable little spot up
the way that's nice and private...

350
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:34,071
I'd rather not.

351
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:35,954
Just when we start thinkin' you're not a bitch.

352
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,871
Don't even go there! Ah!

353
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,496
You want bitch? I'll show bitch!

354
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:42,538
I've had it up to here with you
arrogant little pain-in-the-asses!

355
00:20:42,628 --> 00:20:44,250
Oh, where you goin'? You runnin' away!

356
00:20:44,322 --> 00:20:45,718
You've done well, my boy.

357
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,398
Kunugigaoka Junior High, class Three-E.

358
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,746
Yep, we're assassins. And our target?

359
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:03,357
Our teacher.

360
00:21:07,177 --> 00:21:08,163
All right, people.

361
00:21:08,246 --> 00:21:10,085
Let's get started, shall we?

362
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:12,663
If you thought the first term was a doozy,

363
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:15,454
wait till you see what I've got in store this time around!

364
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:18,311
That's the way it goes in our assassination classroom.

365
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:22,917
The bell rings, another day begins.
