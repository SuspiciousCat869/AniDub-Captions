1
00:00:03,976 --> 00:00:05,365
Let's begin, shall we?

2
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:08,112
Begin what, exactly?

3
00:00:08,268 --> 00:00:09,684
Studying for midterms, of course!

4
00:00:09,768 --> 00:00:11,101
Dun-dun-dun! Whoa, look out!

5
00:00:11,184 --> 00:00:15,310
I'll be making this period a
high-speed enhanced Midterm Study Hall!

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,690
My doubles will provide special

7
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:20,143
one-on-one attention. Drilling everyone individually

8
00:00:20,226 --> 00:00:22,262
on the areas where you need improvement most.

9
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:23,851
Man, this is balls.

10
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:25,559
He's seriously gotta wear a different headband

11
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:26,783
for each subject?

12
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:31,311
Gimme a break, man! Naruto's not even on the test!

13
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:32,726
Look at him go!

14
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:34,949
Is it just me, or is he getting faster?

15
00:00:35,143 --> 00:00:39,976
I mean, six doubles for Japanese, eight
doubles for math, three for social studies,

16
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:41,976
four for science, four for English.

17
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,363
One for Naruto.

18
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,643
A Koro-sensei for each of us.

19
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:49,527
And not that long ago he was doing well
to split himself up into four or five.

20
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:51,934
Knife down, Karma!

21
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,684
No sneak attacks during Study Hall!

22
00:00:53,857 --> 00:00:56,601
This is very difficult, so try
not to disrupt my concentration!

23
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:59,356
Doesn't all this spread you a little bit thin, sir?

24
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,351
I, uh...

25
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:03,667
I mean, just thinking about it, makes me feel tired.

26
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:05,059
No worries there.

27
00:01:05,143 --> 00:01:07,809
I have a double outside on R&R duty!

28
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:09,094
How does that help?!

29
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:12,219
He's been leveling-up like crazy these days.

30
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:13,171
I wonder.

31
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,078
Is he just prepping to destroy the Earth, or what?

32
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:19,568
if you're an assassin,

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,839
he's a tricky target.

34
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:22,934
There, are you starting to wrap your head

35
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:24,573
around the material, Nagisa?

36
00:01:25,222 --> 00:01:25,987
Yes, sir.

37
00:01:27,107 --> 00:01:28,893
And if you're facing midterms,

38
00:01:28,976 --> 00:01:31,447
he's the best damn teacher you could ask for.

39
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:11,613
Consider this deceptively simple cube.

40
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:14,718
If I wished to align the colors

41
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:16,386
quickly and intuitively.

42
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:19,272
What might be the best way to go about it?

43
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:20,518
Any ideas?

44
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:22,551
The answer?

45
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:23,678
Uh?

46
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:26,635
Pry them apart and reassemble.

47
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:28,265
It's as easy as that.

48
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:33,308
Why, Koro-sensei. It's an honor.

49
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:34,839
Uhh?

50
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,559
Apparently this gentleman

51
00:03:36,643 --> 00:03:38,188
is supposed to be the principal here.

52
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:40,912
Believe me, he is, which also makes him our boss.

53
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:44,476
So good of you to come all this way, sir!

54
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:47,201
Any chance we could discuss a
teensy little hike in salary,

55
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:48,684
if I'm not being too forward, of course?

56
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:51,246
I've added a few extra versions of
myself to help with the workload...

57
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:53,053
Forgive me for not visiting sooner.

58
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,393
I meant to pay my respects before now,

59
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:56,985
but one gets sidetracked.

60
00:03:57,815 --> 00:03:59,934
Mr. Karasuma and the Ministry of Defense

61
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:02,151
have painted quite the vivid picture of you.

62
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:05,851
Yes, vivid indeed, though I don't pretend to understand

63
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:07,559
the situation in every particular.

64
00:04:08,476 --> 00:04:11,136
Nor do I feel especially qualified to comment.

65
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,353
However I will say this, if I may be so bold.

66
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:17,226
You seem to be torn between embracing the role

67
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:18,658
of savior or villain.

68
00:04:20,263 --> 00:04:22,320
Savior? Villain?

69
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:24,180
But no matter.

70
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:27,085
Such things aren't for men like myself to resolve.

71
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:29,559
I'm hardly in a position to save the world.

72
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:31,854
That job I must leave to hands more capable.

73
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:35,476
So barring harm to my school,
your assassins may deal with you

74
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:36,232
as they will.

75
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:41,095
I've been given plenty of incentive to turn a blind eye.

76
00:04:41,893 --> 00:04:43,541
Thank you for your cooperation.

77
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:46,329
That's a very reasonable attitude, principal.

78
00:04:46,476 --> 00:04:48,991
I find that quite attractive in a man.

79
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:50,937
You flatter me, madam.

80
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:52,083
That said.

81
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:55,018
Though I'm happy to give you carte Blanche

82
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:56,469
to do what's necessary,

83
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:59,534
I must think of the future, should the Earth survive.

84
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,195
In other words.

85
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:04,397
What becomes of my school if Koro-sensei is assassinated?

86
00:05:06,144 --> 00:05:07,811
Not to put too fine a point on it,

87
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:10,309
but E Class must continue to serve its function

88
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,008
in the grand scheme of things.

89
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:17,268
Interesting. So rock-bottom grades

90
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:20,659
and students with zero prospects
serve a "function," do they?

91
00:05:20,684 --> 00:05:21,414
Oh, yes.

92
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,808
Are you familiar with the so-called Worker Ant Theory?

93
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:28,684
It tells us that in any group, 20 percent will work hard,

94
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:31,851
20 percent will be idle, and the remaining 60 percent

95
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:33,420
will fall somewhere in between.

96
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:36,768
Now, imagine a group without a middle ground,

97
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:39,809
where hard workers comprise 95 percent of the population,

98
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:41,960
and lay-abouts only five.

99
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:45,268
If the lazy worker ants are stigmatized,

100
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:47,188
the ratio is perfectly feasible.

101
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,973
Those who under normal circumstances fall into

102
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:52,518
the average category, better themselves

103
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:55,440
to avoid being associated with the ostracized class.

104
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:56,908
Very logical.

105
00:05:57,351 --> 00:06:00,059
And, of course, unless the five percent is kept down,

106
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:03,260
the incentive for the other 95 disappears.

107
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:06,010
Just today I received an alarming complaint

108
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:07,287
from a D Class teacher.

109
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:10,101
It seems a student of yours glared threateningly

110
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:12,976
at two upperclassmen, such that the upperclassmen

111
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:14,358
feared for their lives.

112
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:21,309
I have no doubt the confidence to do so
stems from their attempts to assassinate you.

113
00:06:21,452 --> 00:06:23,378
And perhaps that's to be expected.

114
00:06:23,893 --> 00:06:27,226
The issue, though, is that an E Class student

115
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:29,261
dared to defy his better.

116
00:06:31,268 --> 00:06:34,215
Obviously I cannot let such insolence stand.

117
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:40,219
As his teachers, you are expected to
remind the student in question of his place.

118
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:42,305
Oh, and Koro-sensei?

119
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,552
You have one second to solve this puzzle!

120
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:45,697
What?

121
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,554
You just spring this on me out of the blue?

122
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,330
Whoa. What the hell is going on?

123
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,284
Your speed certainly lives up to the hype.

124
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:59,028
I can see why most attempts on your
life would be an exercise in futility.

125
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,736
But bear in mind, my friend.
In the grand scheme of things,

126
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:06,885
there are many problems for
which speed is of no use at all.

127
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:12,177
Now, if you'll kindly excuse me.

128
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:13,693
Ah!

129
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:14,942
Oh.

130
00:07:18,682 --> 00:07:21,846
Hi there! I look forward to your midterm results.

131
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:23,323
Best of luck to you.

132
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:24,452
Uh...?

133
00:07:32,393 --> 00:07:35,193
Huh... "Best of luck," the guy says.

134
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,076
And just like that...

135
00:07:37,518 --> 00:07:40,643
I revert from assassin back to an E Class nobody.

136
00:07:42,643 --> 00:07:43,449
As a target,

137
00:07:43,726 --> 00:07:46,070
Koro-sensei is practically invincible.

138
00:07:46,618 --> 00:07:51,068
Amateur and professional assassins alike
have their work cut out trying to off him.

139
00:07:51,784 --> 00:07:56,565
But as a teacher, he's vulnerable to the
whims of people higher up on the food chain.

140
00:07:57,851 --> 00:08:00,451
People like Kunugigaoka Academy principal,

141
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:02,133
Gakuho Asano.

142
00:08:02,946 --> 00:08:05,237
A shrewd man who, in the first decade of his tenure,

143
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:08,530
single-handedly hoisted this school to top-tier status.

144
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,584
Essentially, if you teach here there's no
getting around his personal vision of order.

145
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:17,000
That goes for us and for you.

146
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,579
Good morning, everyone!

147
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:27,964
As you might guess, today, I
thought I'd make even more of me!

148
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,015
This is getting ridiculous.

149
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,631
Thinking caps on, let's begin! Even
the afterimages are getting sloppy.

150
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:38,451
It's like he's turning into a parody of himself.

151
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,143
Uh, Hey, Koro-sensei?

152
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:42,393
No offense, but isn't this going to wear you out?

153
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:44,643
Wear me out? P'shaw!

154
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,518
E Class must continue to serve

155
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:50,684
its function in the grand scheme of things.

156
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:58,392
Look at the poor guy, he's totally down for the count.

157
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,160
I say we try our luck!

158
00:09:00,268 --> 00:09:03,826
Not that I don't appreciate it, but
why's he teaching us so hard anyways?

159
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:09,411
To get those test scores up, why else?

160
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,763
If I do that...

161
00:09:11,963 --> 00:09:13,518
Koro-sensei!

162
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:15,434
Look at my grade! This is awesome!

163
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:18,309
We owe it all to you, Koro-sensei! Thank you!

164
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:20,143
I'll never try to kill you again!

165
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:21,559
Oh, sir! Please!

166
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:23,657
I need help with my grades, too!

167
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:25,559
I'll never have to worry about you

168
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:28,658
trying to kill me again! It'll be sheer bliss!

169
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:32,977
Uh. I mean, the whole helping
us study thing is nice and all...

170
00:09:33,002 --> 00:09:35,518
but, the reward money we get for assassinating him

171
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:36,893
is nothing to sneeze at.

172
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,934
Let's face it, who needs to ace a midterm

173
00:09:39,018 --> 00:09:40,559
when you've got that kind of cash tucked away

174
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:41,723
in your bank account?

175
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:44,504
Money isn't everything, people!

176
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,674
Aw, c'mon, you gotta cut us some
slack here, we're the End Class.

177
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:51,869
Yeah. Assassination we can strive for.
But academics? Seriously, why bother?

178
00:09:53,748 --> 00:09:56,565
I see. So that's how it is, then?

179
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:57,549
Hm?

180
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,155
How what is, sir?

181
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:02,197
Do you know what I think?

182
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:05,488
I don't think you appreciate
what it means to be an assassin.

183
00:10:06,182 --> 00:10:09,015
Everyone. Schoolyard. Now.

184
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,643
What's his deal, making us all stand out here

185
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:21,851
like a bunch of goobers?

186
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:23,608
I dunno, maybe something we said

187
00:10:23,684 --> 00:10:24,637
put him in a mood.

188
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:26,679
All right, children.

189
00:10:27,023 --> 00:10:30,356
Love or hate the E Class system, as a remedial process,

190
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:31,595
it can work.

191
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:34,934
Imagine placing within the top 50

192
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:37,666
of 186 students on midterms.

193
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:41,851
Make that a reality, and securing a former teacher's

194
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:44,143
permission is all an E Class student needs

195
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:46,855
to return to the class from which they were ejected.

196
00:10:48,426 --> 00:10:49,317
But given the conditions

197
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,726
we're forced to work under, the personal setbacks

198
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:54,465
that landed each of you here are difficult to fix.

199
00:10:56,036 --> 00:10:57,684
That's why most E Class students

200
00:10:57,768 --> 00:10:59,809
are convinced that returning to the main campus

201
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,351
is no more than a pipe dream.

202
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:03,800
Don't tell me to hurry up, I'm not a child.

203
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:06,312
Sorry, Koro-sensei asked me to bring you.

204
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:07,851
Ms. Jelavich.

205
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,880
I'd like your opinion as a professional assassin.

206
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:12,739
All right, what do you wanna know?

207
00:11:13,197 --> 00:11:15,328
Now, let's say you've been given an assignment.

208
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:18,018
Do you have only one plan going into it?

209
00:11:18,532 --> 00:11:20,206
Hm? 'Course not.

210
00:11:20,827 --> 00:11:22,618
If my profession has taught me anything,

211
00:11:22,643 --> 00:11:25,268
it's that Plan A almost never comes off like you'd expect.

212
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,934
There are just too many variables.

213
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:30,643
A good assassin has backup plans
on hand for any contingencies.

214
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:32,743
And Mr. Karasuma, what about you?

215
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:33,347
Hm?

216
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:36,101
When teaching knife combat strategies,

217
00:11:36,184 --> 00:11:38,518
do you believe the first strike is the only move

218
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:39,720
of any importance?

219
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:43,089
The first move is important, but so's the follow-up.

220
00:11:43,476 --> 00:11:45,345
Never assume the first strike will hit.

221
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,893
Because when your opponent's trained, you have to be ready

222
00:11:47,976 --> 00:11:50,643
to deliver the next strike with at least as much precision

223
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:53,393
and skill as the first, or, better yet,

224
00:11:53,476 --> 00:11:54,736
carry a second blade.

225
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:59,018
If you have a point, sir, I think we're missing it.

226
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,315
Listen to your teachers, boys and girls!

227
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,299
Backup plans are the cornerstone of confidence,

228
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:07,809
and a confident assassin is a successful one.

229
00:12:07,932 --> 00:12:09,990
The same goes for life in general.

230
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:13,018
You strive for assassination but not academics?

231
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:14,893
You've heard the old saying, right?

232
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:17,434
Don't put all your eggs in one basket!

233
00:12:17,518 --> 00:12:20,493
Well, that's exactly what you're doing here!

234
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:25,817
Now. Suppose I left the classroom for good.

235
00:12:26,018 --> 00:12:29,916
Suppose some other would-be
assassin out there managed to do me in.

236
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:34,175
What would you be left with?
What would you strive for then?

237
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:37,393
Or are you satisfied with being outcasts?

238
00:12:37,646 --> 00:12:40,207
A word of advice from your Koro-sensei,

239
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:42,393
you walk a fine line.

240
00:12:44,185 --> 00:12:46,696
Those who can't wield a second blade

241
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:49,705
aren't qualified to be assassins!

242
00:12:58,784 --> 00:12:59,562
What the...

243
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:02,414
Holy crap, guys, check it out! Is that a tornado?

244
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,131
Hmph. What a showoff.

245
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:20,006
There.

246
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:22,268
Our schoolyard needed a good leveling.

247
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:24,072
Not to mention a few weeds cleared.

248
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,018
I am a superior life-form,

249
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,803
capable of destroying the Earth.

250
00:13:33,134 --> 00:13:35,634
As you can see, flattening out this little corner

251
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:37,051
of it was a cinch.

252
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,637
Cast your nets wide.

253
00:13:39,893 --> 00:13:43,172
Show me your backup plan, that crucial second blade.

254
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:46,351
Otherwise, I'll be forced to conclude no would-be assassin

255
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:48,112
here is worthy of me.

256
00:13:48,351 --> 00:13:50,518
And I won't just have a mind to leave,

257
00:13:50,584 --> 00:13:53,109
I'll flatten this entire campus as I go.

258
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:56,638
A "second blade"? So how long've we got?

259
00:13:56,939 --> 00:13:59,347
Not very. Until the end of tomorrow.

260
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:02,201
The midterms are upon us, class.

261
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:04,976
I want all of you to place in the top 50.

262
00:14:06,942 --> 00:14:08,351
Whether you realize it or not,

263
00:14:08,434 --> 00:14:10,809
we've been sharpening those second blades all along.

264
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:14,309
The main campus relies on dull, rote-learning methods.

265
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:17,478
I, to put it mildly, do not.

266
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:19,392
You have what it takes.

267
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:21,696
So wield those blades with confidence!

268
00:14:22,492 --> 00:14:24,984
Take your midterms by the gills, smiling,

269
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:26,472
your heads held high!

270
00:14:26,718 --> 00:14:28,568
Be proud! Be bold!

271
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:31,393
And never forget, you are assassins!

272
00:14:31,476 --> 00:14:33,675
You are E Class!

273
00:14:33,843 --> 00:14:37,896
Okay. Ready or not, here we go.

274
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:44,493
Hmph!

275
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:02,851
Midterms are administered on the main campus,

276
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:06,175
even for us. Basically, to E Class,

277
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:08,953
they're just an away game. Not much else.

278
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:22,518
Our knife isn't nearly enough to take this thing out!

279
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:24,756
How are we supposed to tackle question four?!

280
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:37,260
I expected this.

281
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:42,599
The midterms they give in this
school have always been a beast.

282
00:15:43,697 --> 00:15:47,131
Damn it. You're kidding me! I
don't even know where to start!

283
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:49,909
This question's gonna eat me alive!

284
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:54,574
I'm dead meat!

285
00:16:03,226 --> 00:16:04,687
Did you really mean that crap?

286
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:08,601
You're gonna take off if they don't all
place in the top 50 on their stupid midterms?!

287
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:09,699
That's right.

288
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:11,826
Well, way to be unrealistic!

289
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:15,579
These kids have the worst grade-point
average in the entire school! Are you nuts?!

290
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,327
I wonder sometimes.

291
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,976
Either way, wherever they've ranked before,

292
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,648
they're my students now.

293
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:24,184
When backed into a corner,

294
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:27,163
the first order of business is assessing your options.

295
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:28,726
If I've taught them nothing else,

296
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:30,563
I've certainly taught them that.

297
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:37,181
Come now, we've covered this.

298
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:40,614
The poor beast isn't as terrifying as all that.

299
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,665
Start by observing that fin.

300
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:47,067
On closer inspection, it's just that, a fin.

301
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:49,434
Next, look over each part of the question

302
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:51,268
with the same attention to detail,

303
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:53,128
and piece together what you find.

304
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:57,569
Voila! A trivial adversary indeed!

305
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:01,635
Now use that trusty blade to fillet it.

306
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:05,480
Of course!

307
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:06,520
Huh?

308
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:11,646
Take the problem one part at time.

309
00:17:11,893 --> 00:17:12,847
That's the trick.

310
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:16,414
Just like Koro-sensei's been teaching us all along!

311
00:17:27,206 --> 00:17:28,378
This question...

312
00:17:30,412 --> 00:17:31,658
is dead meat.

313
00:17:33,123 --> 00:17:34,375
So's this one.

314
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,474
And this one.

315
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:38,865
And this...

316
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,435
And all of a sudden...

317
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:03,098
poised to strike...

318
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:06,768
a question we weren't ready for ambushed us from the rear.

319
00:18:07,893 --> 00:18:10,357
Not to rock the boat, but this is ridiculous.

320
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:12,559
You gotta help me out here.

321
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:14,643
However I look at it, this test seems rigged.

322
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,397
I don't know what to say, sir.

323
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:18,717
You ought to have received proper notification.

324
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:21,760
Perhaps there was some sort of
communications flap on your end?

325
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:24,457
But there's no point in coming to the main campus,

326
00:18:24,526 --> 00:18:25,644
I can tell you that.

327
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:28,543
The communications flap wasn't on our end, buddy.

328
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,352
Besides, what constitutes "proper notification?"

329
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:33,934
Two days before midterms, you decide to broaden the scope

330
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:35,559
and that's supposed to be enough time for us

331
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:36,522
to cover everything?

332
00:18:36,547 --> 00:18:38,393
With all due respect Mr., uh, Karasuma,

333
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:41,511
is it? You don't understand. We're a prep school.

334
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,049
This sort of thing happens all the time.

335
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:45,968
Our students are expected to cram.

336
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:48,001
That's been our policy for years.

337
00:18:48,422 --> 00:18:51,393
In fact, when it was decided to include new material

338
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:54,309
on this midterm, the principal
himself lectured our students

339
00:18:54,393 --> 00:18:56,121
on those subjects personally.

340
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,712
It was wonderful. You should've seen it.

341
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,744
Unbelievable.

342
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:04,340
Is there nothing this man won't
resort to in the name of his own ideals?

343
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:09,342
They've put us in a hell of a spot.

344
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:13,313
If Koro-sensei leaves, we're screwed.

345
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:15,061
We lose everything.

346
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:26,545
I take full responsibility.

347
00:19:27,726 --> 00:19:31,448
Clearly, I underestimated this
school's dedication to the status quo.

348
00:19:32,342 --> 00:19:34,523
Forgive me if I can't bear to face you.

349
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:40,488
Uh...?

350
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:41,743
Have it your way.

351
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:44,244
Keep your back turned if you want.

352
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,101
Just makes it easier for us to sneak up on you.

353
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:48,934
I am in no mood, Karma!

354
00:19:49,018 --> 00:19:51,450
This whole situation has me very de... Uh?!

355
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,875
So they added questions to the stupid test.

356
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:56,628
Big deal.

357
00:19:57,627 --> 00:19:58,394
Seriously?

358
00:19:58,522 --> 00:20:00,667
Hold the phone, you got a hundred in math?

359
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:03,435
Your method worked like a charm, Teach.

360
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:05,809
You gave us everything you had and at the moment of truth,

361
00:20:05,893 --> 00:20:06,616
it mattered.

362
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:09,743
So what if the midterms decided to cover new territory?

363
00:20:09,768 --> 00:20:12,058
I was ready. Don't worry, though.

364
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:16,809
I'm not going anywhere. You see, this is where I belong.

365
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:19,607
Normal Class has nothing on assassination.

366
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:24,230
So. Where are you gonna go, huh? Where do you belong?

367
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:29,847
You plan on using the fact we didn't all make
the top 50 as an excuse to tuck your tail and run?

368
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,056
'Cause you're not fooling me.

369
00:20:32,643 --> 00:20:35,647
I think you're just scared that
one of us is actually gonna kill you.

370
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:43,936
You could've just told us.

371
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:46,031
Not like we'd blame you for being afraid.

372
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:49,398
Next time, consider being more
straightforward with how you feel.

373
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:51,681
Even if how you feel is all, "oh no, I wanna run away!"

374
00:20:57,726 --> 00:20:59,268
No one is running away!

375
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:01,000
'Kay. So what's the deal?

376
00:21:02,073 --> 00:21:06,330
The deal is we get our revenge on
this school two-fold during finals!

377
00:21:07,728 --> 00:21:09,779
Children! This is no laughing matter!

378
00:21:10,072 --> 00:21:12,607
There's no denying we hit a wall on our midterms.

379
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:15,857
The same wall that's always
closed us off from everyone else.

380
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:18,861
But for once, I'm kinda glad to be behind it.

381
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:22,651
Not just glad. Proud. Proud to be in E Class!

382
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:23,223
Who puts E class in the corner?

383
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,050
Nobody puts E Class in the corner!
