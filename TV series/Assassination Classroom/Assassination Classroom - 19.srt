1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,111
Success was so close, we could practically taste it.

2
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:08,842
But then it happened.

3
00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:12,314
Koro-Sensei revealed his Absolute Defense Form.

4
00:00:12,717 --> 00:00:14,967
To make matters worse, we were poisoned.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,987
And with our mentor temporarily
immobile, the only real option

6
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,187
is to deal with the culprit by ourselves.

7
00:00:21,728 --> 00:00:23,079
Ten of your classmates are ill.

8
00:00:23,353 --> 00:00:25,319
Two others have been left behind to care for them.

9
00:00:25,436 --> 00:00:27,476
That leaves you to operate on their behalf.

10
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:31,762
You must sneak in, surprise our
mysterious adversary, and steal the antidote!

11
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:36,753
It's too dangerous. Whoever
the hell this guy is, he's a pro.

12
00:00:37,177 --> 00:00:39,677
This scenario's been planned out to the last detail.

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,680
Perhaps the wisest course of action
would be to simply hand me over, is that it?

14
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,301
Unconditional surrender?

15
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:47,819
The choice is yours.

16
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:48,621
Uh.

17
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:51,275
It's just... this is so hard.

18
00:00:51,792 --> 00:00:53,786
I mean, look how high we'd have to climb!

19
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:57,584
Ten to one they'd plummet to their
deaths before getting halfway up.

20
00:00:58,815 --> 00:01:00,125
It's not worth the risk.

21
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:02,263
We play by the enemy's rules.

22
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:07,594
Nagisa, Kayano. Be on your guard.

23
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:11,464
C'mon. What're we scared of?

24
00:01:11,832 --> 00:01:13,673
It's just a ledge. No big.

25
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:16,500
I know, right? What have we been training for?

26
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,103
Truth.

27
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,540
Oh, yeah. See? We can handle this!

28
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:25,032
Now, whoever's waiting at the
top may be a different story.

29
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:28,370
So, hey, Mr. K? It'd be cool if you came with.

30
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:29,832
We need a commander.

31
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:32,098
Help us make this bastard pay!

32
00:01:32,148 --> 00:01:34,441
Show him what it means to mess with E Class!

33
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:36,124
Look at that.

34
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:38,683
Clearly these are no ordinary teenagers.

35
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:42,582
You have a 15-member special
forces unit at your beck and call.

36
00:01:42,998 --> 00:01:44,459
But I only count fourteen.

37
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:47,096
Probably because you didn't count me.

38
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:49,988
Quickly, my friend. Time is of the essence.

39
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:51,435
Mm...

40
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:00,324
All right, listen up! When we reached the
summit, our objective is the hotel's top floor.

41
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:04,415
This is a stealth infiltration, so our
best weapon is the element of surprise.

42
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:08,993
I want you to use the same hand signals
and link-ups we've been drilling in P.E.

43
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:11,448
The only difference here is who we're targeting.

44
00:02:12,474 --> 00:02:14,593
You've got three minutes to memorize the map.

45
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:17,428
Know the terrain. We commence in five!

46
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:18,503
Yes, sir!

47
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:11,204
Time's running out. Fifty minutes left.

48
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:16,987
Last one up's a rotten egg!

49
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:19,632
Oh, man. Okano moves like a mountain goat.

50
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,895
Yeah. She smokes just about everybody at this stuff.

51
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:25,593
I'm gonna say this knowing it's perfectly obvious.

52
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,146
But getting old looks like it sucks.

53
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,042
You idiot! I swear on my life, if you drop me!

54
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:34,545
Let no one say my students don't have exceptional balance!

55
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:35,849
You're welcome.

56
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:37,875
I make 'em scale the cliff out back.

57
00:04:38,537 --> 00:04:42,490
Oh, I see. Well, that accounts for their
remarkable proficiency at fly-boarding.

58
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:46,782
Ah! Holy crap on a spoon, will
you ladies stop gabbing already?

59
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:50,261
So, uh, remind me why Miss
Bitch felt obligated to come along?

60
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,867
Yeah. She hates feeling left out. Character flaw.

61
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:56,775
I wouldn't mind her so much if
she wasn't such a boat anchor.

62
00:04:57,741 --> 00:04:59,540
Karma, wait! Slow down!

63
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:01,369
Um, if you hadn't noticed,

64
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:03,145
we're kind of on a schedule here.

65
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:06,700
Yeah, you've got a point. Right, let's do it!

66
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,822
Sharp rock. Careful.

67
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:14,017
That was almost ugly.

68
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:17,662
Don't even act like I weigh that much! I'm a feather!

69
00:05:17,862 --> 00:05:19,259
C'mon. Work them guns!

70
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:23,889
I wonder... If this guy knows about

71
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:26,695
Koro-Sensei, who in the world could he be?

72
00:05:33,222 --> 00:05:36,466
Ritsu, I want you to run a final
check on our infiltration route.

73
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:38,803
Right! Displaying interior map now.

74
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:44,921
Analyzing data.

75
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:48,234
All elevators require a unique pass code for every floor.

76
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,467
Stairs are the less conspicuous
option, but there's a catch.

77
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,792
Access doors are arranged at odd angles

78
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,757
to each other across respective foyers.

79
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:58,150
And the stairs themselves cover a lot of ground.

80
00:05:58,422 --> 00:06:00,510
We risk detection at several points.

81
00:06:01,997 --> 00:06:03,933
Cool, it's kind of like a TV station.

82
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,276
What are you talking about?

83
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:07,858
Yeah. I hear they make the layout confusing on purpose.

84
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,292
It's a precaution against terrorists.

85
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,472
Ah! I learned something today.

86
00:06:11,513 --> 00:06:14,690
Ironic bad guys love this sorta
place as a rendezvous point.

87
00:06:15,896 --> 00:06:18,139
Side door locked. One moment.

88
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,141
Let's move. There's not much time.

89
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,998
Yes, sir!

90
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:34,229
Why the hell do they have so many damn security guards?

91
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,850
That's a lot of guys for all of us to sneak past.

92
00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:40,224
Maybe it's best if only one
or two of us take it from here?

93
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:43,206
No, safety in numbers, we don't know who

94
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:45,946
we're up against. How should we do this?

95
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:49,163
Come on, people. What are we
waiting for? Let's just do it.

96
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,944
Do you even comprehend the situation we're in right now?

97
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:55,750
There's too many of us! Uh. Are you out your mind?

98
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:01,828
Watch and learn, sweethearts.

99
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,164
Gulp.

100
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:07,541
Hm?

101
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:14,406
Oh, sorry.

102
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:16,709
Blame the mini bar in my room.

103
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:19,887
Oh, uh. Think nothing of it, ma'am. No harm done.

104
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:23,374
Is that...? That's the piano I'm performing on next week.

105
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:26,138
I came early to do the whole tourist thing.

106
00:07:26,431 --> 00:07:27,848
Wonder if she's any good.

107
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,191
Hey, she can tickle my ivories any time.

108
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,354
Mind if I play a few bars?

109
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:36,261
Let's see if this baby's in tune. I'll help me sober up.

110
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:40,155
You boys have nothing against a little Chopin, right?

111
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:43,024
Well, I... I... I'll check with the front desk,

112
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:43,353
but it should be...

113
00:07:43,378 --> 00:07:44,045
Oh, now,

114
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:48,003
they don't care. C'mon. Help me
out. It'll be a private concert.

115
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:49,711
I'd love some audience feedback.

116
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:51,165
Us? Feedback?

117
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,584
Sure. You work hard.

118
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,560
You deserve a chance to play critic.

119
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,808
Help a lady hone her... technique.

120
00:08:09,584 --> 00:08:10,678
Whoa.

121
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:12,554
Oh, Wow. She can really play.

122
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:14,793
Ah, the Fantasie-Impromptu!

123
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:18,869
That, boys and girls, is an assassin

124
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:22,226
with multiple blades! She charms, she bewitches,

125
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:26,084
she fills the air with the sweet
music, captures the imagination.

126
00:08:26,313 --> 00:08:28,062
Every ear is seduced.

127
00:08:29,306 --> 00:08:31,239
Every eye is riveted!

128
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:35,634
What's wrong? Aw, could it be you're a teensy bit shy?

129
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:38,464
Move in closer so you can see my fingering.

130
00:08:40,925 --> 00:08:43,825
I just bought you your twenty minutes. Get moving.

131
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:44,587
Uh!

132
00:08:48,617 --> 00:08:53,852
For a moment there, were as spellbound as the
guards. Just when you think you know someone.

133
00:08:56,765 --> 00:08:57,516
Uh.

134
00:08:58,452 --> 00:09:00,302
We made it past the first check point!

135
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:02,074
Man. Miss Bitch has some talent.

136
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:04,151
Who'd'a thunk it with those dragon-claws of hers?

137
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:06,277
And she ever mentioned being able to play.

138
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:09,256
Let this be a lesson to you
not to judge a book by its cover.

139
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,942
There's a lot more to a good assassin than meets the eye.

140
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:14,781
Sure, she's crass and overbearing.

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,354
But your Language Arts teacher also happens to
be one of the most dangerous women in the world.

142
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:22,834
See, class?

143
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:25,377
Even when I have none, you're in good hands.

144
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:26,930
Let's go.

145
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:27,663
Mm.

146
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,127
That's right, boys. I call the tune.

147
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:39,685
Okay. We've cleared the lobby
area, so we should be in good shape.

148
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,560
If we're stopped, we'll say we're staying here.

149
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:44,335
But, sir. We're a bunch of junior high kids.

150
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:46,582
I mean, look at us, right? We shouldn't be here.

151
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,290
Why not? There are a lot of kids here.

152
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,255
Where do you think the offspring of the ultra-rich stay

153
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,000
when they travel? That's right.

154
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,662
Only the best for daddy's little prince or princess.

155
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:58,999
You should see some of the antics
those trust-fund brats get up to.

156
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:02,959
Excellent! So, walk around like
you own the place. Turn those noses up

157
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,179
and no one will be the wiser!

158
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:06,457
Let's practice. Show me entitled!

159
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,478
There it is.

160
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,730
Little too much there, gang.

161
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:14,238
Reel it in some. Don't encourage them.

162
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:17,933
It occurs to me, we haven't no
idea what our enemy looks like.

163
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:20,999
Even posing as typical guests we're vulnerable to attack.

164
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:23,899
Best marshal our efforts toward staying vigilant.

165
00:10:24,436 --> 00:10:26,115
Whatever.

166
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:34,911
Thank you. I mean it. You guys rock.

167
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,889
Oh. It's nothing.

168
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:38,343
Their temperature's still rising.

169
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,035
If we don't get the fever to break,

170
00:10:40,212 --> 00:10:42,587
there's the possibility of permanent brain damage.

171
00:10:43,387 --> 00:10:44,253
I'm on it.

172
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:51,372
Oh, um... Do you think there's a chance this virus
could, I dunno, spread to everyone on the island?

173
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:53,311
I don't think it works like that.

174
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,257
We haven't come down with symptoms.

175
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:55,899
Uh...

176
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:58,184
I believe what we're dealing with

177
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:01,084
is spread orally. You'd have to eat or drink after

178
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:02,257
someone already infected.

179
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:04,983
So the threat to random bystanders is fairly low.

180
00:11:06,405 --> 00:11:08,312
Which means the other team shouldn't transmit it anyone.

181
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:15,580
How would someone specifically
target us for infection? When? Where?

182
00:11:20,543 --> 00:11:22,126
People really think we belong here.

183
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,527
They're not even making eye contact.

184
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:25,667
It makes sense if you think about where we are.

185
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,069
This place has a reputation.

186
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:29,039
Folks come here to keep a low profile.

187
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,885
Heh. You know, at first I was sure everybody
here would be a problem. But getting the top floor's

188
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,776
turning out to be a lot easier than we thought.

189
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,523
Glad Mr. K's with us, though.

190
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:39,844
Feels a lot safer with him leading the charge.

191
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:42,925
Who said this was gonna be hard?

192
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:44,913
Hey, we're not there yet.

193
00:11:44,988 --> 00:11:45,962
But, the clock's tickin'.

194
00:11:46,002 --> 00:11:48,376
I say we switch off stealth mode and storm the joint!

195
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:48,892
Wait!

196
00:11:52,218 --> 00:11:53,573
Terasaka! Watch out!

197
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:53,899
Huh.

198
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,704
Huh?! Uh!

199
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,230
Gas!

200
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:01,527
Oh, no! Mr. Karasuma!

201
00:12:03,964 --> 00:12:05,235
What gave me away?

202
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:08,779
I pride myself on being as nondescript as possible.

203
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:11,184
Happens to be one of my strongest selling points,

204
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:12,164
Little Miss Helmet Head.

205
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,459
I've seen you before.

206
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:16,192
You gave us those complimentary drinks back at our hotel.

207
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:20,054
Tropical juice, compliments of the house. Enjoy.

208
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:23,152
Whoa. She's right!

209
00:12:23,214 --> 00:12:25,432
Why would you be here if you worked for the other place?

210
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:26,441
It doesn't add up.

211
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,663
Hey, yeah!

212
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,596
Ha! You've got a good eye for faces.

213
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:33,075
So it was you that got everybody sick!

214
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:34,497
Ha! Is that right?

215
00:12:34,562 --> 00:12:36,364
I'd love to see your evidence, Sherlock.

216
00:12:36,686 --> 00:12:40,243
Tropical islands are a hotbed
for all sorts of icky viruses.

217
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:41,655
Uh, well...

218
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,515
And yet we were split up and on
different parts of the island all day.

219
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,760
The only time we were together was
for dinner on the shipboard restaurant.

220
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:54,110
But Mimura and Okajima bowed
out of dinner to work on the video,

221
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:56,331
and it just so happens they're both under the weather;

222
00:12:56,418 --> 00:12:59,315
Which makes your free drinks the only viable suspect.

223
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:01,430
And since you served them...

224
00:13:02,345 --> 00:13:04,943
you, sir, are the poisoner! Elementary!

225
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:08,159
That was seriously amazing!

226
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:09,368
It's like we're on television!

227
00:13:09,393 --> 00:13:12,213
Hm. I credit my taste in detective manga.

228
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,980
"Eliminate the impossible, and
whatever remains, must the truth!"

229
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:19,155
Ah, yes. Shonen Jump is every sleuth's best friend.

230
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:20,420
The writer's go all out.

231
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:21,380
So, manga?

232
00:13:21,405 --> 00:13:23,072
Hm? Yeah. Why not?

233
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,052
Best way to read the classics.
Locked door murder mysteries,

234
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,279
vanished heirs, phantom blackmailers. You name it.

235
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:32,838
I don't get the reference!

236
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:34,474
Why is this suddenly an advertisement?

237
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:36,634
Knock it off, Fuwa! We're not running a charity.

238
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:43,706
Well, congrats on uncovering my identity,

239
00:13:43,877 --> 00:13:45,826
but I'm afraid it's a little too late.

240
00:13:46,947 --> 00:13:48,408
He's a poisoner, children.

241
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:51,666
An expert at the surreptitious application of his craft.

242
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,333
Not to toot my own horn, but
the gas was a homemade concoction.

243
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,824
One whiff turns enemies into statues.

244
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:01,168
Fresh air disperses the runoff, so there's no trace.

245
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,424
Now, then.

246
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:05,211
I guess it's safe to assume you're not here to trade.

247
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,849
I'll have to tell the big man negotiations deteriorated.

248
00:14:08,244 --> 00:14:10,059
Oh well, you win some, you lose some.

249
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:12,998
That was fast.

250
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:16,517
Crap. They're blocking the exits.

251
00:14:17,197 --> 00:14:19,072
First rule, coming up against an enemy.

252
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:20,919
Scout the exits, block their retreat.

253
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:22,519
Cut off their communications.

254
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:24,805
We've learned from the best; Isn't that right, Mr. K?

255
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:26,495
Sorry, pal.

256
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,690
You were a tad too quick to show us your true colors.

257
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,075
You should've kept quiet and reported us to your boss.

258
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:36,427
Hmph. You can still speak, huh?

259
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:39,719
First rule when up against numerous enemies.

260
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:43,571
Cut off the head, and the body dies.

261
00:14:44,502 --> 00:14:45,254
Observe!

262
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:51,202
Such... such incredible strength.

263
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:54,309
Such inhuman speed.

264
00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:55,380
No matter.

265
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:58,558
The poison will relieve you of command soon enough.

266
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:03,731
Farewell, noble adversary. It's been... a pleasure.

267
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:06,249
No!

268
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:08,100
Mr. Karasuma!

269
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,939
Sir. You can't keep going like this.

270
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:21,836
You've gotta lie down.

271
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:24,521
Just give me half an hour, I'll be fine.

272
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,174
Don't do anything crazy.

273
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,842
Oh, yeah, 'cause we're the crazy ones.

274
00:15:28,972 --> 00:15:30,497
That stuff could've killed an elephant.

275
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:31,550
No kidding, right?

276
00:15:31,703 --> 00:15:33,725
Mr. K must be some kind of monster.

277
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:38,155
Can't believe he walked away from that.

278
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:39,346
Talk about pro.

279
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,210
One bad guy down, but what's the next one gonna be like?

280
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:47,855
Gotta wonder if we'll be able to handle them.

281
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,524
Like... on our own.

282
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,669
Woo-hoo!

283
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:53,060
Summer Vacation is finally in full swing!

284
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:58,250
Nice that you can stay positive!

285
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:00,375
I'd be too if I had a protective shell!

286
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,209
Show him what full swing really means!

287
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:04,625
Take your belt off for a sec.

288
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,457
I'm gonna cram Mr. Have a Nice
Day down your pants so he'll shut up.

289
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:08,631
The hell you are!

290
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:09,672
'Kay, I'll bite.

291
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:11,970
What does it feel like summer vacation all of a sudden?

292
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:15,505
Because my students are acting independently of me.

293
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,805
That's what summer's about, really.

294
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,909
Extended breaks from the
routine of school foster autonomy.

295
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:23,045
You learn to think and act on your own.

296
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:26,358
The prognosis for anyone else
in this predicament would be grim.

297
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,392
But you have the tools to meet your foes head-on.

298
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:32,031
This is an assassination vacation.

299
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:34,534
It's up to you to make the most of it.

300
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,853
Start with primo seafood stock.

301
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:40,866
Don't skimp on the green onions or the minced garlic.

302
00:16:41,426 --> 00:16:43,360
Then, just a dash of steel!

303
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:48,085
It's how you soup-up a gun.

304
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,249
See, when the broth seeps down the barrel, it gets cold.

305
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,643
Well, that makes my blood curdle.

306
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:58,249
I assume the gun's not on safety?

307
00:16:58,507 --> 00:17:01,808
Eh. I know what I'm doin'. Just relax.

308
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:04,515
It'll still shoot when the time comes.

309
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:09,080
A good firearm's gotta have
the personality of a gourmet meal.

310
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:12,549
Just the right balance of the four cardinal flavors:

311
00:17:12,713 --> 00:17:17,285
Savory, sweet, sour, and fatal.

312
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:21,646
You have personality. Are your friends as odd as you are?

313
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:22,790
Don't judge.

314
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:25,718
When you pull off as many jobs as we have,

315
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:27,287
you develop a few quirks.

316
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,599
In this industry it's a sign of being worth your salt.

317
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,469
Take Smog. He's all about the signature poisons.

318
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:37,106
Built a world-class lab to feed his obsession.

319
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,910
You gotta admire that level of dedication.

320
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,430
Quite. What of your other associate?

321
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:44,479
Grip, was his name?

322
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:46,409
Yeah...

323
00:17:47,596 --> 00:17:51,566
Grip. That one's a prime cut of grade-A weirdo,

324
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,115
even by our standards.

325
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:56,095
Mm.

326
00:18:04,592 --> 00:18:06,114
Um, okay.

327
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:08,378
Why's that dude just standing out in the open?

328
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,500
Gives me the heebie-jeebies.

329
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:13,892
Yeah. I'm definitely picking up a kill-or-be-killed vibe.

330
00:18:14,738 --> 00:18:16,776
Well, to be honest, mostly kill.

331
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:20,845
A scenic walkway with an unobstructed view.

332
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:24,113
So much for surprise attack, or safety in numbers.

333
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:27,033
Dammit. What I wouldn't give for a real gun.

334
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:30,616
Who'd have known I needed to
pack heat for a trip like this?

335
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:35,846
Boring.

336
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:38,315
I can hear your footsteps, people.

337
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,811
I wanted to kill someone
interesting, not a bunch of amateurs.

338
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:46,768
Ain't your squadron leader supposed to be some
kinda special forces dick, or did he get bagged? Hun.

339
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:49,803
Hun. Tough break.

340
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:52,543
Guess the gas got to him before I had the chance, hun.

341
00:18:52,905 --> 00:18:57,398
Smog live, or did they kill each other at
the same time, like men? Hun, lemme see ya.

342
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,797
He cracked the freaking window with his hand!

343
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:01,760
Yeah... That's not all.

344
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:07,535
Nobody's got the nerve to say it, but the way he talks.

345
00:19:08,337 --> 00:19:10,004
Dude. What's with all the stupid "Huns?"

346
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:12,486
Why does he always say what we're thinking.

347
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:14,479
Hun. It's how samurai's talk.

348
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:17,632
Read some place they used to do it
all the time to sound intimidating.

349
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,708
I like the way it plays. Makes me feel badass.

350
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,536
Okay. So, he's a little off.

351
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:26,310
This is actually the first
time I've tried it out, so no big.

352
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:29,167
Hun, I might decide to drop it once I've killed you.

353
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,784
No one else's heard me talk
this, so it'd be a clean slate.

354
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:32,911
Your hands, sir.

355
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:35,668
Are those the only "tools of the trade" at your disposal?

356
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:39,667
Makes staying incognito easy as pie. Someone pats me down,

357
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,730
I got nothin'. But I can still snap their neck.

358
00:19:42,318 --> 00:19:43,582
These babies know what's up.

359
00:19:43,944 --> 00:19:44,908
Hun, they do.

360
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:48,007
Sometimes when the mood strikes me I can crush a skull.

361
00:19:48,344 --> 00:19:50,009
Funny thing 'bout bein' this good.

362
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:53,211
The better you get at sendin'
folks to the sweet hereafter,

363
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:56,813
the more you crave usin' you gifts
for somethin' beyond just plain killing.

364
00:19:58,205 --> 00:20:00,347
I mean, you still wanna kill, hun.

365
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:03,255
You just wish someone'd give you a real challenge.

366
00:20:04,098 --> 00:20:07,004
That's what blows about this. I was hopin' for

367
00:20:07,116 --> 00:20:10,033
a worthy adversary. Instead I get... you.

368
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,384
You don't what know a pain it is
to snuff out a whole group, hun.

369
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:15,703
I'm callin' the boss to come clean this place up.

370
00:20:18,231 --> 00:20:19,779
Speaking of letdowns...

371
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,463
Hm.

372
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:23,672
You seem fairly average for a professional.

373
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:27,343
And I can break glass, too, if that's all it takes.

374
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,955
What I wouldn't do is call in reinforcements
as an opening move. But then I'm not especially

375
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:34,832
threatened by "a bunch of amateurs."

376
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:36,694
Karma! Stop!

377
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:37,925
Not so fast, Mr. Karasuma.

378
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,427
The boy's chin is down.

379
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:46,107
Karma typically enters a fight with
his chin angled upward. It shows disdain.

380
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:48,906
He's literally looking down his nose at his opponent.

381
00:20:49,084 --> 00:20:50,382
This is different.

382
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,896
True, his words may be dripping with arrogance,

383
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,186
but his eyes are staring daggers.

384
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,749
He's alert, locking his opponent's gaze.

385
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:02,793
Finals were quite a blow to his precious ego.

386
00:21:03,084 --> 00:21:06,360
But I suspect he's taken the
lessons of that failure to heart.

387
00:21:08,137 --> 00:21:08,617
Heh.

388
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:14,369
Hmph. All right. Put your money where your mouth is.

389
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:18,810
Go at him with everything you've got, Karma!

390
00:21:19,097 --> 00:21:21,432
You're going head-to-head... with an adult!
