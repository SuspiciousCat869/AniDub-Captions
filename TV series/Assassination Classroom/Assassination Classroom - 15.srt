1
00:00:01,508 --> 00:00:02,674
Surprise!

2
00:00:02,758 --> 00:00:05,634
Hey! It's Kunudon!

3
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:08,008
Hiya, kids! Are you ready for this?

4
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,638
Sir, yes, sir!

5
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:11,703
Look sharp, it's finals!

6
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:13,466
The most important test of the year!

7
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:14,635
I hope you've studied.

8
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,766
Here at Kunugigaoka Academy, grades are everything:

9
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:20,266
And we all know what happens to boys and girls who fail.

10
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:22,341
They become gutter trash!

11
00:00:22,424 --> 00:00:25,743
Speaking of. How to we think
E Class will do on the finals?

12
00:00:25,819 --> 00:00:29,031
They'll bomb! Hooray!

13
00:00:31,258 --> 00:00:32,841
The basics, you've got down pat.

14
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:33,975
No question there.

15
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:36,563
And if your performance First
Semester is anything to go on,

16
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:39,267
I believe we can reasonably
expect your scores to sky rocket!

17
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:41,341
So what's the deal? Will it be like last time?

18
00:00:41,424 --> 00:00:43,968
Either we place in the top 50 or you pack it up and go?

19
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:45,280
Nope! With midterms,

20
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,386
I've come to realize my focus
on rank was too shortsighted.

21
00:00:48,702 --> 00:00:49,553
Phooey to that.

22
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:54,105
Far better that each of you have individual
goals tailored to affect personal academic growth.

23
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:56,133
Therefore, I've devised the perfect target:

24
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:58,928
An objective customized to your needs as assassins.

25
00:01:00,804 --> 00:01:02,341
Not to worry, Terasaka my boy!

26
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:04,218
Even you can do well if you believe it!

27
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:07,285
Now, then.

28
00:01:07,654 --> 00:01:09,487
You'll recall Shiro revealed to us

29
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:12,982
that the loss of a tentacle results in diminished speed.

30
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:17,868
One less appendage and already the
integrity of my doppelgängers is compromised.

31
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:21,531
Note that several of them have now
become childhood versions of yours truly.

32
00:01:21,843 --> 00:01:24,088
'Kay. Seems logical.

33
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:26,417
Lose another, and presto!

34
00:01:27,883 --> 00:01:29,633
Even more child-clones thrown into the mix!

35
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:32,566
Along with fretful parent-clones
struggling to make ends meet.

36
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:34,425
Now it's getting a little sad.

37
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:35,990
Lose another.

38
00:01:37,168 --> 00:01:38,585
And the father-clone has walked out,

39
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:43,061
leaving the poor, beleaguered mother-clone
to fend for her latchkey brood however she can.

40
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:44,642
Ugh. Brutal.

41
00:01:45,383 --> 00:01:47,175
The main take away here, class,

42
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,585
is that each tentacle kerplooied represents
ten percent reduction in my agility.

43
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:53,434
Which brings me to my proposition.

44
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Those of you who get the highest scores on your final,

45
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:57,716
and or the best ranking in each individual subject,

46
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,413
are vouchsafed the right to
obliterate exactly one tentacle a piece.

47
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:05,154
This is how we do finals here, boys and girls.

48
00:02:05,253 --> 00:02:07,503
This is the Assassination Classroom!

49
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,351
Ask yourself.

50
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:11,773
Are you prepared to inch ever closer to the grand prize?

51
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:14,562
I've gotta hand it to him.

52
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:17,350
The one thing Koro-sensei does better than anything,

53
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:18,725
is motivate.

54
00:03:55,674 --> 00:03:57,681
Frankly, your suggestion appalls me.

55
00:03:57,888 --> 00:04:02,009
I'm an educator. I've no vested
interest in seeing E Class fail.

56
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:04,799
Uh. Well, obviously, I can see that.

57
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:07,008
It's this stuffed shirt who needs convincing.

58
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:09,709
Hm. Let me be perfectly clear.

59
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:13,752
The chief aim of this institution
is to foster student autonomy.

60
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,404
Our students determine their own level of achievement.

61
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,844
My role is ancillary.

62
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:20,773
I do nothing. Only monitor.

63
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:26,854
Hard to trust a man who throws
ten-dollar words in your face.

64
00:04:27,122 --> 00:04:28,998
That crap about "automony." Ugh.

65
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:34,210
Yeah, well. All we can really do is hope
none of the tricks he pulls this time are new.

66
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:39,518
Hey. Since Koro-sensei's rewarding their test
scores with tentacle-takeouts, we need to get in there.

67
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:42,702
What do you think about me teaching Phys Ed for a while?

68
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:45,302
C'mon, pweeze! I could give them an edge!

69
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:46,891
Stick with Language Arts.

70
00:04:47,018 --> 00:04:47,867
Stop that.

71
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:51,096
A tentacle for each top score earned on our final.

72
00:04:51,195 --> 00:04:53,008
I know! It's exciting, huh?

73
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:53,904
That's rare.

74
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:56,035
You're really fired up about this, aren't you?

75
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:58,859
Of course! I know science backwards and forwards.

76
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:01,918
This is my shot. I finally get to contribute to the cause!

77
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:04,686
What's cool is everybody's good at something on the test.

78
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:07,658
Koro-sensei'll lose so many arms he won't have a prayer!

79
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:08,572
Hm?

80
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:10,510
It's Shindo.

81
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:14,252
Hey, what's up? How's it goin', man?

82
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:15,945
Heh. Still lickin' your wounds?

83
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,416
Yeah. Hell of a tournament, huh?

84
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,010
'Member how I said payback's a bitch?

85
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:23,919
Best make it to high school so
we can actually go head-to-head.

86
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:27,155
Doesn't sound like you hold out a lotta hope for me.

87
00:05:28,235 --> 00:05:29,944
Listen, somethin' you should know.

88
00:05:30,717 --> 00:05:32,494
Right now, as I'm talkin' to you,

89
00:05:32,742 --> 00:05:37,150
A Class is holed up in one of the Main Campus
conference rooms doing an independent study hall.

90
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:39,945
It's being led by a bunch of geniuses.

91
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:42,650
The school's finest. They're called the Big Five.

92
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:43,314
Uh?

93
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:49,299
Coming in at second place on the midterms.

94
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:54,795
Upwardly mobile, ruthless multi-national
social networking conglomerate CEO in training.

95
00:05:54,924 --> 00:05:58,529
Media Club President and Social Engineer: Teppei Araki!

96
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:02,248
In third place.

97
00:06:02,402 --> 00:06:04,110
Envy of the Humanities Department,

98
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,710
inimitable wordsmith.

99
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:09,168
Student Council Secretary and Perspicacious Poet:

100
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:11,256
Ren Sakakibara!

101
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:14,420
In fifth place.

102
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:16,876
A true sorcerer of science,

103
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:20,568
consumed by fantasies of retribution against Akabane.

104
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:25,020
Biology Club President: Natsuhiko Koyama!

105
00:06:26,258 --> 00:06:30,425
In sixth place, an infamous wit who sharpened his tongue

106
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:33,862
on West Coast vernacular while kicking it in LA.

107
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:38,184
Student Council Meeting Leader: Tomoya Seo!

108
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:40,861
Um, quick question, dude.

109
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:42,301
What're you doing with your voice?

110
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:43,410
Oh, I've...

111
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,311
always wanted to be an announcer. Just practicing.

112
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:50,649
Anyway, lording over all these
guys is the grand overachiever.

113
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,682
We are the best and brightest.

114
00:06:53,008 --> 00:06:55,814
The sun around which the entire student body orbits.

115
00:06:56,136 --> 00:06:59,303
Alas, storm clouds are moving in, ladies and gentlemen,

116
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:01,797
casting their pall over our brilliance from below.

117
00:07:03,126 --> 00:07:04,835
We know E Class attempted to scratch

118
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,256
and bite their way into the top
fiftieth percentile on midterms.

119
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:10,361
Now that finals are upon us,

120
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,674
measures must be taken to drive the Untouchables out.

121
00:07:14,716 --> 00:07:17,174
We must see to it that the storm clouds evaporate.

122
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:19,252
That our incandescence slices through.

123
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:21,323
Who's with me?

124
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,892
In first place,

125
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:28,339
hoisting his flag on the top
spot of the National Mock Exams

126
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:30,533
with perfect score in every subject,

127
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:33,392
the man with a genetic disposition to lead.

128
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:38,135
Student Council President: Gakushu Asano!

129
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:41,019
The principal's only son.

130
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:44,509
Mr. President, about question three.

131
00:07:45,543 --> 00:07:47,178
Ah. That is a puzzler.

132
00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:50,380
Try again. Be sure to complete the square first.

133
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:53,803
You know the axis equation. X equals A, so.

134
00:07:54,168 --> 00:07:55,694
Oh! Of course!

135
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:58,731
You gotta figure high scores are a given with this bunch.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,533
The head honchos have ambition,
charisma, reputations to uphold.

137
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:05,723
And above all, the desire to keep you down.

138
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:06,755
You know this.

139
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:08,835
If you place the particle after this word,

140
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:11,155
the meaning of the sentence changes completely.

141
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:12,529
But you wanna be careful.

142
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:14,558
Pronouns and how they're used should change

143
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:15,708
depending on the speaker.

144
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:18,218
Come on! This isn't rocket science!

145
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:20,251
I've seen babies more eloquent than you.

146
00:08:20,654 --> 00:08:24,716
This single innovation affected fundamental
change across the whole field of information theory.

147
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:25,877
Are you even listening?

148
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,166
Don't assume this won't be on the exam!

149
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:29,774
What's the matter, head gettin' full?

150
00:08:29,851 --> 00:08:32,916
This is O-Chem. Memorization is your only hope! Ah!

151
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:35,984
Asano has perfect scores in every subject.

152
00:08:36,091 --> 00:08:39,258
The other four are experts,
man. You can't be messin' around.

153
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:40,624
It's serious business.

154
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,421
They're hardcore.

155
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,288
They don't want you guys back on the Main Campus.

156
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:45,835
It's a point of pride.

157
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:47,622
Thanks for the tip, Shindo.

158
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:49,299
They don't have to worry for now.

159
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:51,443
We're not looking to go back.

160
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:54,582
It's kind of personal. I'd explain, but I really can't.

161
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,131
Let's just say, uh...

162
00:08:56,742 --> 00:08:58,911
Beating A Class is in our best interest.

163
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:01,477
We're fighters. You know this.

164
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:05,005
Hm. More power to ya.

165
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:08,182
Just remember, this is your fight, so leave me out of it.

166
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:09,311
Yeah...

167
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,996
First in every subject?

168
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:14,761
Hey, guys! Wait up!

169
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:15,770
What's goin' on?

170
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:19,393
You wanna hit the books at the Main
Campus library tomorrow after class?

171
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:21,218
I reserved us a spot.

172
00:09:21,324 --> 00:09:23,295
Actually, been holdin' on to this for a while.

173
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:25,441
Normally, we're dead last on the waiting list,

174
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:28,293
so, this little miracle is like a platinum ticket.

175
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:29,932
Count us in!

176
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:30,659
Me, too!

177
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:32,718
Look at how fired up they are.

178
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:35,124
It was certainly worth putting my tentacles on the line.

179
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:37,921
Yes, sir.

180
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:43,562
As instructed, I've raised the bar
considerably with regards to A Class's test scores.

181
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,524
I trust that you're satisfied?

182
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,431
Sadly... no.

183
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:49,607
I require results, young man.

184
00:09:49,811 --> 00:09:52,730
A status report in and of itself is meaningless.

185
00:09:53,508 --> 00:09:54,922
You know as well as I,

186
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:57,935
excellence is not rewarded so much as expected, son.

187
00:09:58,091 --> 00:10:03,034
If you and your classmates rank in the top 50
and secure the top spot in all subjects, you pass.

188
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:06,443
All to keep the E Class upstarts firmly in line.

189
00:10:06,826 --> 00:10:09,788
I understand the principle all too well, forgive the pun.

190
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,086
Why you cling to it is somewhat lost on me.

191
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:16,526
Yes, granted, their grades may be on the upswing,

192
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:19,051
but they can only get so far.

193
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:22,452
They won't trump their betters. It's unthinkable.

194
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:26,273
Don't let that confidence be your undoing, my boy.

195
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:27,814
Things change.

196
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:31,398
The scales can tip in favor of the rabble in an instant.

197
00:10:31,636 --> 00:10:33,694
The elite do well to take heed.

198
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:38,050
Those at the top must mind their balance.

199
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:40,972
An excellent point very well made.

200
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:44,491
I'll see to it that we get
results, sir. You may rest easy.

201
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:47,502
One more thing. A simple question.

202
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:50,283
Not asking as a student, but as your son.

203
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:54,428
Oh, dear. I do hope you don't expect special treatment.

204
00:10:54,543 --> 00:10:56,210
No, no, wouldn't dream of it.

205
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:58,673
It's just simple curiosity.

206
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:00,540
What is it about E Class?

207
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:03,750
It's almost like you have something to hide.

208
00:11:09,684 --> 00:11:11,798
You haven't raised an idiot, father.

209
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,123
Any fool can see the idlers have more claim to
your attention these days than in years previous.

210
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,378
Hard as it is to give credit to,

211
00:11:20,902 --> 00:11:24,154
I just can't shake the idea that
you're involved in something shady.

212
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,893
Rumors of strange happenings.

213
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:31,454
Eye-witness accounts of a flying yellow octopus.

214
00:11:31,844 --> 00:11:35,157
A ridiculously disguised man
buying large amounts of junk food.

215
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:39,787
Well-endowed coeds hearing
suggestive disembodied whispers.

216
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:41,292
Huh.

217
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,413
What gives? Mass hallucinations, or something else?

218
00:11:46,136 --> 00:11:47,480
If I didn't know better,

219
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:50,371
I'd say you were digging for something to use against me.

220
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,278
Why on earth would I do that?

221
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:54,551
But you could hardly blame me if I were.

222
00:11:55,035 --> 00:11:56,416
I am your protégée.

223
00:11:57,856 --> 00:12:00,687
Nice touch, indeed. Spoken like a well-trained dog.

224
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,219
Careful. One day the master
might find himself on the leash.

225
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:10,054
Or the dog might find himself in thrall to his master

226
00:12:10,258 --> 00:12:12,883
as a corporate slave till the day he dies.

227
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:30,474
Well, look at that. It's the E Class crew.

228
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:34,216
Why even bother? This place is wasted on you.

229
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:36,424
Pearls before swine, as the saying goes.

230
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:38,229
Ugh. Don't tell me.

231
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:39,960
The Big Five.

232
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:41,674
How cute. They're studying.

233
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:45,205
Hey, scrubs, playtime's over.
The big kids need their spot.

234
00:12:45,258 --> 00:12:46,424
Hey! Do you mind?

235
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:48,191
We're trying to fill our heads with knowledge!

236
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:49,605
Um, Kayano.

237
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:51,466
We're not going anywhere.

238
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:53,424
We reserved these seats in advance.

239
00:12:53,508 --> 00:12:57,424
Ah. Yeah. You don't know what it is to study
in air-conditioning till you don't have it.

240
00:12:57,508 --> 00:12:58,567
Move along, please.

241
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:00,434
Well what do we have here, fellas?

242
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,875
Are the hard-luck cases defying their betters now?

243
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:05,399
I mean, I knew they were stupid, but this is a new low.

244
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:07,341
Hey! He said these were ours!

245
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:07,982
What?

246
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:10,633
You're not the only ones allowed to have good grades!

247
00:13:10,716 --> 00:13:12,883
Everyone has a right to them if they work hard.

248
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:15,768
Try bossing us around when we
kick your butts on the finals.

249
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,412
Whoa. Okuda.

250
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,091
You sure have gall talkin'
like that to me, you little twerp!

251
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,841
And nice glasses by the way, they
make you look like a total nerd!

252
00:13:22,955 --> 00:13:24,164
Ha! Am I right?

253
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:25,461
Uh. I guess?

254
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:27,674
Don't be so quick to judge.

255
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:28,344
Huh?

256
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:29,290
Look at her.

257
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:31,840
Oh, my, pearls before swine, indeed.

258
00:13:32,357 --> 00:13:36,664
Hey there. Something tells me you're the
sort of woman who gets her thrills from a sonnet.

259
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:39,341
You make me wonder if my standards aren't too high.

260
00:13:39,424 --> 00:13:41,216
Um. Could you get out of my ear, please?

261
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:43,814
She attracts the worst kind of guys.

262
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:46,920
Wait a minute. I know who these kids are.

263
00:13:49,341 --> 00:13:52,450
Yukiko Kanzaki, ranked 23rd in Japanese.

264
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:55,524
Rio Nakamura, ranked 11th in English.

265
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:58,790
Yuma Isogai, ranked 14th in Social Studies.

266
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:01,419
Manami Okuda, 17th in Science.

267
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,437
Oops, sorry!

268
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:05,852
Turns out these aren't your average everyday dumbasses.

269
00:14:05,883 --> 00:14:07,885
They actually have some academic chops!

270
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,983
Is that a fact? How interesting.

271
00:14:10,508 --> 00:14:13,008
Well, as long as we're all here,
why not make it even more interesting

272
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:16,023
and wager those chops against
stakes higher than bragging rights?

273
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:19,091
Whoever scores lower has to do what the other class says.

274
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:20,035
Sound fun?

275
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:23,474
C'mon, don't be a wuss.

276
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:25,675
Where the hell's that attitude all of a sudden?

277
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,679
If you wanted to, we'd even put our lives on the line.

278
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:38,316
I'd be more careful about betting my life if I were you.

279
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,716
Ha! You don't scare me! We have ourselves a deal, kid!

280
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,674
You don't even know what we're gonna make you guys do

281
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,466
when you lose!

282
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:45,966
Don't try backin' out now.

283
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:47,580
You'll regret this!

284
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:53,277
Well, we just opened up a can of worms.

285
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:55,668
Wait till everyone else catches wind of this.

286
00:14:57,966 --> 00:14:59,703
I... I know it was stupid, but...

287
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,299
Look, I was only tryin' make a point, okay?

288
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:04,674
C'mon. I never thought they'd actually take us up on it.

289
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:06,759
It's all right. You're not in trouble.

290
00:15:07,424 --> 00:15:10,174
In fact, this might be a good way to inspire A Class.

291
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:14,883
But for now, let us focus on clarifying the terms.

292
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:16,817
We don't want confusion down the road.

293
00:15:17,174 --> 00:15:20,101
I propose the winners be allowed only one demand.

294
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:22,299
To be specified after finals are done.

295
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:22,912
Hm?

296
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,850
Not to rock the boat, but seriously? Only one?

297
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:28,192
Yeah, not a lot we can do with that.

298
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,226
Oh, I believe there's quite a lot we can do with that.

299
00:15:36,758 --> 00:15:38,395
If the demand is this...

300
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:45,108
Signing a contract that pledges their
total subjugation to us in 50 separate clauses.

301
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:47,258
Upon observance of full compliance,

302
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:51,615
the constituents of A Class agree to act
as role models for the constituents of E.

303
00:15:51,924 --> 00:15:53,967
Classic "Status of Forces" agreement.

304
00:15:55,758 --> 00:15:58,933
One demand encompassing 50 lined items of servitude!

305
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:01,467
Sounds like a win-win to me, boss!

306
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,754
Not bad.

307
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,272
Did you just come up with all
these off the top of your head?

308
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,115
You're terrifying, man.

309
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,883
What do you mean by that?

310
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:10,103
I'm a little hurt.

311
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:12,423
I'm just a student

312
00:16:12,616 --> 00:16:15,918
humbly exercising his autonomy in a nurturing environment.

313
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:17,991
Nothing scary about that, in the least.

314
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:21,479
If my grasp of civil law is such
that I know how to crush a man,

315
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:22,297
what of it?

316
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:25,024
Right.

317
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,628
The point I'm laboring toward is this.

318
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:30,330
When we play, we play for keeps.

319
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,880
In school, as in life, there is one rule.

320
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:34,915
Only the weak show mercy.

321
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:37,299
Our job is to light the way.

322
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:39,261
Let's show them all what the game is about!

323
00:16:42,383 --> 00:16:43,799
You have to give the guy credit.

324
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:45,459
He knows how to rally the troops.

325
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:47,905
Is he a hypocrite? Yes.

326
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,160
Can we see through him? Of course.

327
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:54,094
Do we go along with the bastard anyway? Absolutely.

328
00:16:54,758 --> 00:16:57,525
He's the undisputed heavy weight champ of coercion.

329
00:16:58,008 --> 00:16:59,218
Gakushu Asano.

330
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,556
I don't think there's anyone
in this school who can beat him.

331
00:17:05,383 --> 00:17:06,383
Blast it all, Karma!

332
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:08,049
Wake up and get with the program!

333
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:09,508
Apply yourself, for heaven's sake!

334
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:11,852
You could get the best overall score!

335
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:13,049
Calm down, Teach.

336
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,966
You an' I both know I'm gonna do fine.

337
00:17:15,473 --> 00:17:17,770
My laziness is a credit to your study method.

338
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:20,018
We can both afford to relax.

339
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:22,807
You especially right now. I mean, look at yourself.

340
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:25,318
You're startin' to come off like a regular teacher.

341
00:17:25,508 --> 00:17:26,945
Uptight and boring.

342
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,999
We've already got a plan of attack, right?

343
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:33,342
You should have a little more faith in it.

344
00:17:33,739 --> 00:17:36,439
Are you that worried about A Class winning this?

345
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,091
Why should we worry? C'mon, man. We're us.

346
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:41,633
We've got absolutely nothin' to lose. What can they do?

347
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:44,247
If we win, they'll do whatever we tell 'em to.

348
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,967
I vote we force 'em to let us use the cafeteria.

349
00:17:49,174 --> 00:17:51,472
Not a bad idea, but what about this?

350
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:55,261
I say force them to relinquish their pride and joy.

351
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:56,858
The school pamphlet?

352
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:01,912
You're already well acquainted with
being the low man on the totem pole,

353
00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:06,049
but I want you to experience what it's
like to fight one's way, tooth and nail,

354
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:07,673
all the way to the top!

355
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:11,144
An assassin aims high to bring his target low.

356
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:20,845
My son has stirred up quite a
blood-frenzy among his peers.

357
00:18:22,856 --> 00:18:27,272
We must utilize his ferment to improve
our fine institution's standard deviation.

358
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:28,924
Worry not, Principal.

359
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,633
The questions here will bedevil even A Class.

360
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:33,660
Ha! My best work.

361
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:36,465
Concentrated nuggets of specialized knowledge, these.

362
00:18:36,674 --> 00:18:37,371
Oh-ho!

363
00:18:37,453 --> 00:18:41,009
I hesitate to even call them exam questions at this stage.

364
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:43,415
No!

365
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,824
They've become conundrums! Riddles! Outright beasts!

366
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:50,726
Satisfactory.

367
00:18:51,491 --> 00:18:53,960
No doubt they will inspire.

368
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:57,966
Nested among reams of legal jargon

369
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:00,379
hides an item of special interest.

370
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,946
A sub-clause forbidding E Class

371
00:19:03,341 --> 00:19:05,774
from keeping even the tiniest of secrets.

372
00:19:06,726 --> 00:19:08,896
Whatever you're trying to smokescreen, father,

373
00:19:09,258 --> 00:19:10,692
don't think I won't find it.

374
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:12,685
Once they've signed this,

375
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:15,403
the E Class dolts will be a cinch to shake down.

376
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:19,084
Soon, I'll have uncovered your biggest weakness.

377
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:20,973
You'll be at my mercy.

378
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:24,112
And we all know you're thoughts on that subject.

379
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:32,745
All right, Nagisa.

380
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:34,780
You ready to kick ass or what?

381
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,799
I guess. If the test is fair.

382
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:38,841
Hey, hey! A tad more confidence, please!

383
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:40,508
We're shootin' for the top spot on this baby,

384
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:41,454
so don't mess up!

385
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,075
This is gonna be hysterical.

386
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,966
Ha! The rumors true? You make a bet with A Class?

387
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:47,633
I wonder if you morons appreciate

388
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:49,272
what you've gotten yourselves into.

389
00:19:53,768 --> 00:19:55,159
Oh, look. Cool. We're first.

390
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:56,208
Uh?

391
00:19:59,133 --> 00:19:59,901
Who's that?

392
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:01,340
Ritsu's proxy.

393
00:20:01,674 --> 00:20:02,325
Yeah, I know.

394
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:05,566
The Principal said an AI taking the
finals was against testing protocol.

395
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:08,665
Hey, at least the man was okay with us using a stand-in.

396
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:11,899
Ever have to deal with him giving you that look?

397
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:14,021
You know the one, right? It's so...

398
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,471
I don't know. It's like he
can't even be bothered to pity you.

399
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:18,747
Makes you feel like a damn child.

400
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,154
Thanks for dealing with him!

401
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:25,027
Anyway, Ritsu and I have a li'l message for you guys.

402
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:26,868
Do your best.

403
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:28,694
You got it.

404
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:34,820
Let the battle begin.

405
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:38,354
I won't lose. I don't lose.

406
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:43,837
Here we go. Things are about to get interesting.

407
00:20:44,424 --> 00:20:47,063
What's cool is while we're taking the exams separately,

408
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:48,717
we're all in this together.

409
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,236
There are the people we fight alongside of.

410
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:54,246
The people we fight.

411
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:59,486
The ones who want us to lose, the ones who want us to win,

412
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,498
almost feels like an arena.

413
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:08,475
We might be assassins,

414
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,495
but right now, we have to fight like gladiators.

415
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:19,010
Another day, another bell.

416
00:21:21,424 --> 00:21:23,847
Round one... begin!
