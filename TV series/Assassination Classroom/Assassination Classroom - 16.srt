1
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:05,880
Here we go.

2
00:00:06,302 --> 00:00:08,255
Things are about to get interesting.

3
00:00:08,566 --> 00:00:11,290
What's cool, is while we're taking the exams separately,

4
00:00:11,482 --> 00:00:12,870
we're all in this together.

5
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:16,375
There are the people we fight alongside of.

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,401
The people we fight.

7
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:23,214
The ones who want us to lose, the ones who want us to win,

8
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:25,248
almost feels like an arena.

9
00:00:30,857 --> 00:00:32,423
We might be assassins,

10
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:36,467
but right now, we have to fight like gladiators.

11
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:43,133
Another day, another bell.

12
00:00:45,524 --> 00:00:47,925
Round one... begin!

13
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:51,658
Tests are splendid.

14
00:00:52,107 --> 00:00:54,941
The knowledge soaked up by
those eager minds in preparation

15
00:00:55,024 --> 00:00:57,418
may be forgotten once the dust has settled.

16
00:00:58,066 --> 00:00:59,261
But c'est la vie.

17
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,692
The character-building thrill of competition,

18
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:04,743
the privilege of honing one's mind to a fine point,

19
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:08,982
the ecstasy of giving it your all. That's the treasure.

20
00:01:11,224 --> 00:01:12,126
Oh, man!

21
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:15,151
The midterms had nothing on this!

22
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:17,845
I mean, I get it. We're a top school.

23
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:20,881
They start throwing advance
level stuff at us in Third Year,

24
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,127
but holy crap!

25
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:26,003
English, Math, Science. The whole shebang.

26
00:01:26,316 --> 00:01:28,785
And we're expected to move at lightning speed.

27
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:32,130
Well. This is the moment of truth, right here.

28
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:33,567
Good luck, everybody.

29
00:03:14,232 --> 00:03:16,024
Bring it on, last problem!

30
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:19,566
Oh, you're adorable.

31
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:21,857
I know the card catalog backwards and forwards.

32
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,024
You don't scare me!

33
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:24,899
The E Class scrubs, on the other hand.

34
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:26,190
S.O.L!

35
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:32,793
What the...

36
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:34,428
Why aren't you out of commission?

37
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:36,384
That's a quote from "Huck Finn," right?

38
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:37,267
Huh?

39
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:38,872
Whoa.

40
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:40,769
You gotta learn to relax.

41
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:43,462
Seriously. Curl up with a good book once in a while.

42
00:03:47,024 --> 00:03:48,659
She actually got it right?

43
00:03:48,982 --> 00:03:50,121
Are you kidding me?

44
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:52,409
What? You don't know "Catcher in the Rye"?

45
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,230
Oh, wait. It's not a textbook. Why would you?

46
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:58,399
My, these are excellent questions.

47
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:00,291
Good on them. I'm impressed.

48
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:02,899
This isn't just some rote classic Lit query.

49
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:06,732
The students are asked to take an
infamously thorny twentieth century text

50
00:04:06,816 --> 00:04:08,751
and correct a misquoted passage.

51
00:04:09,232 --> 00:04:11,649
And Salinger, no less. He wrote in a style

52
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:14,838
reflective of his angsty teenage
protagonist's natural voice.

53
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:15,625
Got it!

54
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:17,667
Son of a...

55
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,191
The Lit teacher only mentioned that book in passing!

56
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:22,433
We never actually read the stupid thing.

57
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,238
Ah. So nobody recommended it to you? That is a crime.

58
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:29,679
Someone needs a literate octopus to
push 'em outside their comfort zone.

59
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,801
Holden Caulfield's rebellious spirit is enthralling.

60
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:35,462
An absolute must for boys and girls your age.

61
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,524
I recommend following it up with "A Clockwork Orange."

62
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:39,619
Mind-blowing!

63
00:04:39,857 --> 00:04:40,682
Damn it.

64
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:42,717
Yeah!

65
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:44,543
Bring it on, Science!

66
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,899
But... I memorized everything.

67
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:55,945
Why can't I get the armor to come off of it?

68
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:57,840
It's not that simple.

69
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:58,649
Good job!

70
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,899
Um. How do I put this?

71
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:03,146
Science isn't just memorization.

72
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:03,771
Huh?

73
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,566
Sure, you stand on the shoulders of giants,

74
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:09,419
but the whole point is to see further than they did.

75
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:13,598
You have to think for yourself, make your own discoveries.

76
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,649
Uh...

77
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:21,357
More importantly, like Koro-sensei taught me,

78
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:22,519
communicate.

79
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:25,641
That way the next person can stand on your shoulders.

80
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:27,801
This is ridiculous!

81
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:31,357
How am I supposed know how many
times the Tokyo International Conference

82
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:33,148
on African Development has met?

83
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:36,774
Whew. That was a close shave.

84
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:39,539
But lucky for me I do know how many times they've met.

85
00:05:39,896 --> 00:05:41,896
Ugh! Oh, come on, what are the chances?

86
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,263
I know. Coincidence.

87
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:45,899
I happen to sympathize with Africa's poverty issues.

88
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:48,602
Thing is, my family's dirt poor, so I kinda get it.

89
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:50,112
Let's go on a trip!

90
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:52,566
No time like the present!

91
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:54,737
I actually got a chance to go there recently.

92
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:57,079
It's a fascinating place. You should visit.

93
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:05,033
"Spring has gone away. And summer came, it would seem...

94
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:08,631
From those white hemp robes. Laid to dry in the sunlight.

95
00:06:08,816 --> 00:06:10,482
On Kagu's Heavenly Hill."

96
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,054
A translation worthy of your beauty, my dear.

97
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,282
However, sloppy modern syntax does not
a satisfactory answer on the finals make.

98
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,160
Mathematics.

99
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,003
Akabane's a member of E Class, isn't he?

100
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:34,860
He placed second on the midterms. Right below me.

101
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:38,918
Quite an accomplishment for a slacker. Heh.

102
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:43,145
Commendable, but not intimidating.

103
00:06:43,357 --> 00:06:45,761
You see, I am anything but a slacker.

104
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:55,126
Aw, how cute.

105
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,549
Look at 'em all. So panicked.

106
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:00,553
So hell-bent on not screwing up.

107
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:11,831
The key to true victory is learning
how not to take the game so... seriously.

108
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:20,001
It doesn't matter how hard your
opponent works if you're better than them.

109
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:21,751
This should be fun.

110
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:24,340
Two days of testing.

111
00:07:24,816 --> 00:07:26,858
Two days of putting it all on the line.

112
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,691
Everything we're trying to do

113
00:07:28,774 --> 00:07:31,363
lives or dies by the number of circles we get.

114
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,418
All righty, class.

115
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:42,706
This is it. The test scores are in.

116
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:54,451
Without further ado. The English portion.

117
00:07:57,805 --> 00:08:00,306
First in E Class... Oh-ho!

118
00:08:00,653 --> 00:08:02,983
First in the entire grade!

119
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:05,248
Rio Nakamura!

120
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:08,528
That's right.

121
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,340
Son of a...

122
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,151
Bravo, my dear.

123
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:16,574
I'm glad to see my misgivings
about your enthusiasm were unfounded.

124
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:20,441
Hey, nothin' comes 'tween this
girl and the promise of cash.

125
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:22,354
There is a little matter of your tentacle.

126
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,607
Right? You haven't forgotten?

127
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:25,229
Perish the thought.

128
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,271
Nagisa, good show overall,

129
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:31,107
but it seems we still have an eensy, teensy issue

130
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:32,133
with your spelling.

131
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:34,316
Something to work on.

132
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,950
In the meantime, as agreed, top marks in
a given subject equal one tentacle down.

133
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:42,716
So, let's continue poring over
the grades to see if I'll lose more.

134
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,100
Next is Japanese.

135
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:47,903
First in E Class...

136
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,367
Yukiko Kanzaki!

137
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:54,775
But I'm afraid the honor of first in the entire grade

138
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:57,571
goes to A Class's Gakushu Asano.

139
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,298
Still, you gave the principal's son a run for his money.

140
00:09:02,487 --> 00:09:04,443
Guys' a know-it-all. Total asshole.

141
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:05,816
No kidding, right?

142
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:08,816
Ugh. Nakamura only beat him in
English by the skin of her teeth.

143
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,696
Classic Type A personality.

144
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:13,357
Guess that's the reason he's ranked nationally, huh?

145
00:09:13,558 --> 00:09:16,076
All of the Big Five jerks are ranked nationally.

146
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,213
Asano's King of the Hill, though.

147
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:21,907
Nobody gets to the top without going through him first.

148
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,299
Moving on to the next subject.

149
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:30,211
In Social Studies, first in E Class goes to Yuma Isogai!

150
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:32,810
As for first in the grade.

151
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:34,779
Da-da-da-da!

152
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:37,941
You beat out Asano for the top spot!

153
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:39,172
Uh. Yeah!

154
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:41,357
Excellent job!

155
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:43,666
Especially considering the fiendish questions

156
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:44,597
they casted you.

157
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:46,555
Right now we're two to one.

158
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:48,586
Who got it for Science? Okuda?

159
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:52,662
First in E Class for Science is... Manami Okuda!

160
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:53,600
And...

161
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:57,536
Outstanding! You're also first for the grade!

162
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,484
Yes! Three to one, guys!

163
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:07,424
Do we even need to hear who won for
Math? E Class killed it! No question!

164
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:08,363
Hooray!

165
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:09,990
Nice goin', Okuda! Yeah!

166
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,808
Girl, that tentacle is yours. You earned it!

167
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,440
Yes! Now A Class has to do whatever we tell them!

168
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:15,607
Yeah they do!

169
00:10:15,786 --> 00:10:17,701
Which just leaves Mathematics.

170
00:10:26,347 --> 00:10:29,805
We're three and two across all five subjects.

171
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,755
The Untouchables handed us our
asses. This is it. We're dead.

172
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:36,941
We still beat 'em on overall scores. Don't be a wuss.

173
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,039
Could've been a lot worse. What are they gonna do?

174
00:10:39,107 --> 00:10:39,697
Eh.

175
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:42,627
Yeah, 'least the jackass who stole fourth place from me

176
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:46,306
is choking on humble pie. Ha! Cocky little bastard!

177
00:10:46,524 --> 00:10:48,659
Talk about brining a knife to a gun fight.

178
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,121
Guy didn't even compete!

179
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:57,811
Never underestimate your target.

180
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,513
Particularly when it has a
monopoly on grade point averages.

181
00:11:01,857 --> 00:11:05,629
The best scores in E Class
went to Katakoa and Takebayashi,

182
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,232
both admirably tied for seventh place.

183
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:10,443
Not surprising. They studied hard.

184
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,384
As, of course, did your opponents
in A Class, which is to be expected.

185
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:16,441
These finals were nothing to sneeze at.

186
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,784
One's only chance was to study.

187
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:21,472
What're you tryin' to say, Teach?

188
00:11:21,832 --> 00:11:25,524
Someone thought they could coast by
on luck and a devil-may-care attitude,

189
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,971
and proceeded to royally screw it up.

190
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,532
"My congratulations to you on retaining the top rank."

191
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:35,523
Or so I'd like to say.

192
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:38,736
Would in fact be saying if not for your idiotic wager.

193
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:42,390
Instead, let me offer my condolences.

194
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:47,816
Indeed, it must be quite devastating to
realize your loss made you the laughingstock

195
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:50,724
of the entire school. What a pickle you're in.

196
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:54,236
Shall I step in on my son's behalf?

197
00:11:55,704 --> 00:11:56,825
Thanks, but no.

198
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:59,137
Have it your way.

199
00:11:59,662 --> 00:12:02,896
What was that you said about
finding myself at the end of a leash?

200
00:12:03,232 --> 00:12:06,725
You'd hoped to finagle E Class
into divulging my secrets, didn't you?

201
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,949
They aren't yours to find, boy.

202
00:12:09,982 --> 00:12:13,835
I won't be ensnared by a whelp who
can't win a bet against his peers.

203
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:25,816
Three of your classmates each have a claim
two of my tentacles: Nakamura, Isogai, and Okuda.

204
00:12:25,922 --> 00:12:27,797
You, on the other hand, have nothing.

205
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:30,816
Which is only fair, as that's exactly what your carefree,

206
00:12:30,914 --> 00:12:33,497
non-committal attitude has contributed to the cause.

207
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,192
See where I'm going with this?

208
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,524
Those who fail to apply themselves, who,
at the moment of truth, decide to sit back

209
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:42,566
and let the chips fall where they
may, are destined for disappointment.

210
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:44,630
Dull is the blade of the lazy assassin.

211
00:12:44,727 --> 00:12:47,316
In fact, I wouldn't stoop to call him an assassin at all.

212
00:12:47,415 --> 00:12:49,187
A blowhard and a braggart, perhaps.

213
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:51,518
But an assassin? I think not.

214
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,199
Hey.

215
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:57,399
You think that was a bit harsh?

216
00:12:57,566 --> 00:12:59,504
Of course. It had to be.

217
00:12:59,823 --> 00:13:02,156
I cut him down so he'll spring back up.

218
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:04,649
The boy's enormously talented.

219
00:13:04,732 --> 00:13:07,899
There's no denying that, but he's a novice.

220
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:10,786
He has not yet learned how to be worthy of that talent.

221
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:14,438
He refuses to meet any challenge except on his own terms.

222
00:13:14,482 --> 00:13:17,094
He doesn't see the true value of competition.

223
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:20,566
To a young person for whom everything comes easily,

224
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:23,379
the pang of defeat can be a much-needed wake up call.

225
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:25,201
On the surface,

226
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:27,485
the whole concept of exams may seem arbitrary,

227
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:29,773
but deep down, it's not about grades.

228
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,482
It's about rising to the occasion.

229
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:35,256
It's about tasting the rapture
in triumph and disgrace of failure.

230
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,149
They go hand in hand, you see.

231
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:39,896
One is meaningless without the other.

232
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:42,487
To win, one has to lose.

233
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:45,607
The difference between the novice and the master

234
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:49,508
is that the master has failed
more times than the novice has tried.

235
00:13:55,904 --> 00:13:57,566
Okie dokie, class.

236
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:59,973
A fine showing on the finals.

237
00:14:00,348 --> 00:14:03,937
You managed to snag the top
spot in three out of five subjects.

238
00:14:04,606 --> 00:14:07,378
Let's get this assassination attempt under way, shall we?

239
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:10,372
The top three students can pick
whichever tentacle they'd like.

240
00:14:10,443 --> 00:14:12,669
Three tentacles I can comfortably live without.

241
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:14,124
Six, however? Whew!

242
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:15,528
That would've been a tad sketchy.

243
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:17,006
Hold up, Octopus.

244
00:14:17,031 --> 00:14:17,420
Eh?

245
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:20,707
What's this B.S. about us only havin' three spots?

246
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:22,066
Uh. I believe all subjects

247
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:23,399
have been accounted for.

248
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,903
Umm. English, Science, Social Studies. Umm...

249
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:29,288
Nice try. I don't think so.

250
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,982
English, Social Studies, Science,
and let's not forget Home Ec.

251
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:34,816
We aced 'em all. Read 'em and weep.

252
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,510
What?! Home Ec?!

253
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:40,546
Hey, if it was covered on the finals, it counts.

254
00:14:41,374 --> 00:14:42,941
What do you know? The idiot pulled his weight.

255
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,017
I'm proud of us.

256
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:45,829
Not so fast! Home Ec is a blow off...

257
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:46,866
Hang on, Teach.

258
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:49,651
Wow. That was just plain rude.

259
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,716
You ask me,

260
00:14:50,787 --> 00:14:53,154
Home Ec is straight-up one of the most important classes.

261
00:14:53,337 --> 00:14:55,399
Look at you tryin' to cheat! C'mon, be a man!

262
00:14:55,482 --> 00:14:57,025
Home Ec is the toughest one!

263
00:14:57,088 --> 00:14:58,649
And all four of 'em got top score!

264
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,876
That makes for seven tentacles in all!

265
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:01,794
Seven?

266
00:15:02,107 --> 00:15:04,772
Seven shots! Seven shots!

267
00:15:04,797 --> 00:15:05,963
Oh, Koro-sensei?

268
00:15:06,276 --> 00:15:08,401
We put our heads together and got this idea.

269
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:09,991
See, we were all thinkin'.

270
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,994
We could use our wager with A
Class to kinda sweeten the pot.

271
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:13,741
Nani?

272
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,557
The last day of school is always marked by a big assembly.

273
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:22,710
This year, we've got some unfinished business.

274
00:15:26,563 --> 00:15:28,271
Hey, hey! Lookie here!

275
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,945
Well if ain't Mr. Big Man on Campus himself!

276
00:15:31,117 --> 00:15:33,793
Pardon me. Some of us have a ceremony to get to.

277
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:36,152
I don't have time to indulge the likes of you...

278
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,217
Whoa! Whoa!

279
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:40,459
Not so fast there, slick. What's the big rush?

280
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:45,607
We had a bet. And last I checked, you lost.

281
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,364
We don't wanna rub your faces
in it, that's just how it is.

282
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:50,457
Our demand was sent to you via email.

283
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,098
I assume you can make that happen.

284
00:15:52,972 --> 00:15:56,340
If you even try to play like none
of this was for real, that's it.

285
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,176
We'll throw in Home Ec.

286
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,774
We mopped the floor with you in that, too.

287
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:01,695
Not that anybody's keepin' score.

288
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:04,413
Oh, wait a second, never mind. Yeah they are.

289
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:06,399
Those kids got the better of you.

290
00:16:07,018 --> 00:16:08,250
It's gotta string a little.

291
00:16:08,712 --> 00:16:09,760
Let's be honest,

292
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:13,091
the Home Ec argument was splitting hairs, but so be it.

293
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:14,654
I'm honestly glad.

294
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:19,857
Sure, no accredited university devotes
space to Home Ec on their entrance exams,

295
00:16:19,994 --> 00:16:25,157
but that means Home Ec teachers have more
freedom to create an exam based on personal taste.

296
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:29,805
Preparing for something that
arbitrary is a near impossible feat.

297
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,649
The limits those extraordinary boys and girls

298
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:35,597
stretched themselves to for a leg up on the finals

299
00:16:35,683 --> 00:16:37,089
gives me pause.

300
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:40,024
They found and successfully exploited

301
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:42,735
the tiniest of loopholes just to make headway.

302
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:45,610
Seasoned assassins could take a page from their book.

303
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,849
Hmm.

304
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:48,938
You're so sweet.

305
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:51,694
Why couldn't we go the assembly again?

306
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,732
Mr. Karasuma said our presence would be a distraction.

307
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:57,080
Ugh. Yours maybe, Calamari.

308
00:16:57,135 --> 00:16:58,939
Yours more likely... bitch.

309
00:17:02,178 --> 00:17:02,910
Karma!

310
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:04,566
Surprised to see you here.

311
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:06,876
Since when do you make time for stuff like this?

312
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:08,388
Not big deal, man.

313
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:11,691
If I didn't put in an appearance,
everyone'd think I was running away.

314
00:17:11,774 --> 00:17:12,215
Hm?

315
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:13,957
Yeah, you should check it out sometime.

316
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,658
It sounds interesting... Uh?

317
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:22,691
Not to be that guy. But Ritsu's stand-in is
giving me a serious case of the willies, sir.

318
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:23,901
Suck it up, soldier.

319
00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:26,612
We can't afford to have the
real thing exposed as a machine.

320
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:29,349
Her stand-in is my immediate supervisor's daughter,

321
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:30,331
so ease up.

322
00:17:30,537 --> 00:17:32,197
Kid knows how to keep a secret.

323
00:17:32,414 --> 00:17:33,488
Her father agreed to this

324
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:35,649
because Ritsu's tutoring got her grades up.

325
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:38,566
No offense, but she's been
hovering 'round me since finals.

326
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:39,768
I mean she's nice,

327
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,170
but she's definitely the reason I came in dead last.

328
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,888
Dead last in E Class, he means.

329
00:17:44,956 --> 00:17:47,044
Which is still around average for the whole grade.

330
00:17:47,513 --> 00:17:48,418
Who would've thought?

331
00:17:48,706 --> 00:17:50,549
He's come a long way from the bottom.

332
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,053
Vacation is no excuse for becoming lazy.

333
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:57,516
Uh... You, uh. Hmm.

334
00:17:57,805 --> 00:18:01,315
A few months of fun in the sun
isn't worth landing in E Class.

335
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:03,783
His usual pot shots are bombing.

336
00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:07,156
We're kinda hard to use as a negative example now, huh?

337
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:10,713
Too bad Koro-sensei's not here.

338
00:18:10,986 --> 00:18:13,113
He's the whole the reason we're standing tall.

339
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:20,550
The term comes to a close with E
Class more aware of their potential.

340
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:23,346
The whole school is more aware.

341
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,593
The winds of change are stirring,

342
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,136
fanning the flames of rebellion.

343
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,191
And here we stand, the Earth's very survival in question.

344
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:35,521
All in all, my teaching methods
function as they always have,

345
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:37,473
like a well-oiled machine.

346
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:42,080
And yet, the underdogs threaten to become an inspiration.

347
00:18:42,607 --> 00:18:43,392
A beacon.

348
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:47,252
Absolutely unacceptable.

349
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,024
One guidebook for each of you.

350
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:55,905
Doesn't really get how to sum things up, does he?

351
00:18:55,953 --> 00:18:57,691
Feels like I'm playing an accordion.

352
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,166
These barely begin to scratch the surface.

353
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:03,779
The irresistible siren-songs of Summer are beyond count.

354
00:19:04,622 --> 00:19:09,149
Now, then. As we plunge headlong
into the break, remember this.

355
00:19:09,332 --> 00:19:12,231
A certain main event is just around the corner.

356
00:19:12,454 --> 00:19:15,496
Yeah. Trust us, Teach, no one's gonna forget that.

357
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:21,082
Every year, this little event is a privilege reserved
for the students with the highest scores on the finals.

358
00:19:21,186 --> 00:19:23,191
That is to say: A Class.

359
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:24,506
This time, however,

360
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:28,439
A and E Class were neck-and-neck
at the top fiftieth percentile.

361
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:32,629
So, I'm proud to say, you boys
and girls more than qualify.

362
00:19:34,463 --> 00:19:39,279
For the Kunugigaoka Junior High
Summer Special Course in Okinawa!

363
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:42,079
Three whole days at one of the
finest resorts on the island!

364
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:46,691
Who even cares?

365
00:19:46,774 --> 00:19:50,209
So they get to go to Okinawa. Big deal. It's a local trip.

366
00:19:50,249 --> 00:19:52,357
You were supposed to represent and you choked!

367
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,330
Assholes!

368
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:55,711
Asano's the only one of you worth a damn!

369
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,396
Everyone shut up.

370
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,304
Huh?

371
00:19:58,478 --> 00:20:00,952
We lost. That's the end of it.

372
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:04,565
At least have the self-respect to be graceful in defeat.

373
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:07,258
Heads will roll for this.

374
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,628
And E Class's necks will the first on the chopping block.

375
00:20:11,004 --> 00:20:12,800
Followed by my father.

376
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:17,755
So, then. What will it be?

377
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,041
Well, we've decided we'd like

378
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:22,975
to cash-in our tentacle freebie
options during Summer camp.

379
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:24,331
Very good.

380
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:27,075
Seven tentacles will present a major handicap.

381
00:20:27,131 --> 00:20:28,139
But that's not all!

382
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,927
Anything about Okinawa strike you as advantageous?

383
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:34,470
Perhaps the fact that it's an island, surround by water.

384
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,662
I'll be honest with you, children.

385
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:39,936
Koro-sensei is more than a wee bit nervous.

386
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:44,441
As you know, I've already handed out the
report cards for you to show your parents.

387
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:48,598
But these are the report cards specifically for assassins.

388
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:56,644
Double circles for the entire class.

389
00:20:56,915 --> 00:20:58,551
The highest score possible.

390
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:01,068
Given to us by our target.

391
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:03,358
You've become a formidable bunch.

392
00:21:03,536 --> 00:21:04,715
You should be proud.

393
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:08,323
The first term has been all about
the basics, which you've mastered.

394
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:10,977
But now, we're gonna step things up!

395
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:12,470
First term is over!

396
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,482
Let the Assassination Classroom Summer Vacation begin!

397
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:20,361
Time for a little R&R, a little
supplemental study, and a lotta killing!
