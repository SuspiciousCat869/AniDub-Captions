1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:04,052
Talk about an awesome field trip, huh?

2
00:00:04,174 --> 00:00:05,437
Chyeah, no kidding.

3
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:07,594
Too bad we go back to normal today.

4
00:00:07,938 --> 00:00:09,139
You call this normal?

5
00:00:10,037 --> 00:00:11,345
Yo! Wait up, guys!

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:11,813
Hey.

7
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:13,428
Morning, Isogai. How's it goin'?

8
00:00:13,538 --> 00:00:14,602
D'you get that email?

9
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:17,311
The one Mr. Karasuma sent out to us last night?

10
00:00:17,336 --> 00:00:17,717
Yep.

11
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,855
Something about a transfer student, right?

12
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:24,541
Hmm... Seems kinda fishy to me.

13
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:26,948
They're probably just trying out another assassin.

14
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:30,230
Weird they got professional
killers our age, don't you think?

15
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:32,589
Maybe the teacher thing has gotten too obvious?

16
00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:35,844
We all saw how that cover worked out for Professor Bitch.

17
00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:37,339
Have you seen a pic?!

18
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:39,076
Dude, what are you? A Ninja?

19
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,061
Naturally I was curious, so I figured I'd
hit Mr. Karasuma up for some photos, you know?

20
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,777
Ask and you shall receive!

21
00:00:45,926 --> 00:00:47,301
Whoa! It's a girl?

22
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:49,487
And you've already made her your background.

23
00:00:49,512 --> 00:00:50,677
She's really cute.

24
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:52,967
Not just cute! Adorable!

25
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:56,113
Yaaah... This is the one I've been waiting for!

26
00:00:56,494 --> 00:00:58,322
She doesn't look like an assassin.

27
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,885
Why am I suddenly so nervous?

28
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:01,801
Hey, take it down a notch, people can see you.

29
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:04,760
You've got to wonder what the new girl's all about.

30
00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:08,770
Assassin or not, let's hope she's ready
to be the center of attention for a while.

31
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:12,178
Newcomers tend to cause something of an uproar in E Class.

32
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:15,778
Think she's here yet? My money's on yes.

33
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:17,460
Let's go say hello.

34
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:17,977
Huh?

35
00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:26,734
The hell is this?

36
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:30,013
Good morning, fellow students.

37
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,330
I am A.I.F.A., which is an acronym for
Autonomous Intelligence Fixed Artillery,

38
00:01:35,665 --> 00:01:37,993
and I am happy to be a part of this class.

39
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,550
It's come to this?

40
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:22,838
As you've probably already figured out for
yourselves, this is our new "transfer student."

41
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,105
The Autonomous Intelligence Fixed
Artillery, on loan from Norway.

42
00:03:29,227 --> 00:03:31,872
It's nice to meet all of you. Thank you for having me.

43
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:35,317
Mr. Karasuma is so over it.

44
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:38,665
Not making smart-ass comments about this
will be the hardest thing I've ever done.

45
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,460
I'll thank you not to laugh!

46
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:43,135
This is a serious deal!

47
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:46,844
The AIFA is registered here as
part of the foreign exchange program.

48
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,754
She'll be trying to kill you like everyone else here,

49
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:53,469
and, as per our agreement, you'll have zero recourse.

50
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:56,490
No fighting back. No harming her in any way.

51
00:03:56,515 --> 00:04:00,512
The arrangement we have concerning
the students' safety still applies.

52
00:04:00,902 --> 00:04:02,172
Mm-hmm...

53
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:06,677
You and your government might be extending
that arrangement a bit too liberally.

54
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:08,464
But very well.

55
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:12,500
Welcome to E Class, Autonomous
Intelligence Fixed Artillery.

56
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:16,433
Thank you, Koro-sensei. I certainly appreciate it.

57
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,606
All right, then.

58
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:22,749
Now, as we know, of the three characters
in our story, one is already dead.

59
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,844
So, like, how's it supposed to attack?

60
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,015
What d'you mean?

61
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,986
Well they call it a "fixed artillery," don't they?

62
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:31,950
Do you see any guns? 'Cause I sure don't.

63
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:34,360
Hmm. Yeah. Good point.

64
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:37,592
...concern for Kaiji, or are these
visits motivated by something else?

65
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:43,517
Never mind!

66
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,451
Holy crap!

67
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:50,074
Four shotguns. Two machine guns.
Veritable cascade of anti-me BB's.

68
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:53,998
I applaud your preparedness, young lady, but
out of concern for someone shooting their eye out,

69
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:57,076
I'm afraid use of firearms
during class is strictly prohibited.

70
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:58,089
Chyeah!

71
00:04:59,868 --> 00:05:00,781
Understood.

72
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:03,658
The next round of fire will be aimed more carefully.

73
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:07,552
Its assassination strategies evolve.

74
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,793
Meaning we're about to see what this baby can do.

75
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,969
Recalculating trajectory.

76
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:14,190
Correcting angle.

77
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:17,815
Entering auto-evolution phase 52802.

78
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,739
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Stubborn, aren't we?

79
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:25,838
An identical attack? Really?

80
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,351
What else can I expect from a computer?

81
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:32,346
You realize defending myself, under
the circumstances, is child's play.

82
00:05:42,518 --> 00:05:45,194
Oh dear. A blind spot?

83
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:49,340
A second BB was following the same
trajectory as the one deflected by the chalk!

84
00:05:49,423 --> 00:05:51,113
How fiendishly clever!

85
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:53,626
Left fingertip destroyed.

86
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:55,807
Newly added secondary gun effective.

87
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,420
Its core programming is engineered around processing
and integrating new information exponentially.

88
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,835
Each attempt builds on the last.

89
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,485
Probability of neutralizing target
with third attack less than 0.001 percent.

90
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:15,500
Probability of neutralizing target with
fourth attack: less than 0.003 percent.

91
00:06:15,712 --> 00:06:19,775
Probability of neutralizing target
before graduation, minimum 90 percent.

92
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:22,281
Be advised.

93
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:25,302
Third attack is commencing now, Koro-sensei.

94
00:06:31,854 --> 00:06:33,146
Near misses: Two.

95
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,502
Confirmed hits:  One. Recalculating prior estimates.

96
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:38,844
Deploying additional four main guns.

97
00:06:39,156 --> 00:06:41,325
Resume attack with supplemental firepower.

98
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,927
I think we might have underestimated the new girl.

99
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:48,242
Then again, who could've seen this coming?

100
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:52,988
Transfer student? More like bona fide killing machine.

101
00:06:53,926 --> 00:06:56,198
So, this thing learns as it shoots.

102
00:06:57,063 --> 00:06:58,052
What a world.

103
00:06:58,233 --> 00:06:59,271
Yeah. Sure.

104
00:06:59,296 --> 00:07:01,005
Imagine her with actual bullets, though.

105
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:04,555
Her inventors are using this as a
proving ground to showcase what she's got.

106
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:07,135
Personally, I think she stands a good chance.

107
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:09,737
Hmph. You can't think it'll be that simple?

108
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,312
What about this classroom being
no place for easy resolution?

109
00:07:13,844 --> 00:07:15,307
If things were that straightforward,

110
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:16,879
none of us would be here.

111
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:23,908
Ugh, awesome. Now we get to clean up the mess.

112
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:26,657
Hey, hotstuff. How about you help us out?

113
00:07:26,682 --> 00:07:28,594
You got a vacuum cleaner in there or what?

114
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,148
Fine. Be all stuck-up!

115
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:35,041
Uh. Dude. Please. She's a computer, just give it up.

116
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,749
Second period.

117
00:07:39,963 --> 00:07:40,990
Third period.

118
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:47,513
All day, the killing machine kept at it,
only breaking to calculate her next move.

119
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,115
Then, the next morning.

120
00:07:53,228 --> 00:07:56,569
0800 hours, 29 minutes and 35 seconds.

121
00:07:56,861 --> 00:08:00,058
All systems ready. Power supply voltage, stable.

122
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:03,069
Operating system, normal. Recording disc, normal.

123
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,390
Various devices, normal. No viruses detected.

124
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:08,058
Program, start.

125
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,485
Verifying tasks.

126
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,768
Today's agenda: Accrue attack incidence of 250 units

127
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:15,697
before commencement of sixth period.

128
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:19,199
Continue ongoing analysis of target's evasive patterns.

129
00:08:24,652 --> 00:08:25,696
Koro-sensei.

130
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:28,389
I cannot take out my guns in these restraints.

131
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:30,361
I must ask that you remove them.

132
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:31,139
Hmmm.

133
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:33,377
I don't know if that's a good idea.

134
00:08:33,402 --> 00:08:35,693
Are you the agency responsible, sir?

135
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:38,552
These restraints are tantamount to harm.

136
00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:41,624
Clearly you are in direct violation
of your agreement not to subject...

137
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:42,549
Shut up.

138
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:47,300
It was me. Nothin' says I can't give you a hard time.

139
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,985
'Specially if you're gonna be a pain in the
ass and shoot up the place every two seconds.

140
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,242
Why bother trying to explain it
to a machine? She can't understand.

141
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,152
It's nothing personal. We'll free you after class is over.

142
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,677
You've brought this on yourself.

143
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,802
I mean, we're tryin' to learn here, too.

144
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:02,848
Give your core programming a rest.

145
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,068
Autonomous Intelligence Fixed Artillery to headquarters:

146
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:12,547
Execution of Second Day tasks delayed
indefinitely due to unforeseen problems.

147
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:16,314
Probability of rectifying
problems independently: zero percent.

148
00:09:16,497 --> 00:09:21,277
Probability of achieving assassination
goal significantly decreased.

149
00:09:21,642 --> 00:09:23,433
Requesting immediate assistance.

150
00:09:23,974 --> 00:09:26,373
Don't go crying to mommy and daddy.

151
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:29,277
They're the ones who got you into this pickle.

152
00:09:29,478 --> 00:09:32,585
Besides, you're a student. A transfer student at that,

153
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:34,569
which makes you my responsibility.

154
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,375
I realize it's no picnic being the new kid.

155
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,277
But if we can just find a way to make
the other boys and girls warm up to you...

156
00:09:41,302 --> 00:09:42,246
What do you mean?

157
00:09:42,596 --> 00:09:46,902
Can you appreciate why the other boys and
girls are foiling your assassination attempts?

158
00:09:47,773 --> 00:09:52,635
For starters, they're here to learn and
your methods are enormously disruptive.

159
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:55,017
For another, if you happened to succeed,

160
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:58,344
the reward money will go to your "parents," not to them.

161
00:09:58,654 --> 00:10:03,092
So, letting you kill me has no upshot for them whatsoever.

162
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:05,802
I believe I am beginning to understand, Koro-sensei.

163
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,377
It seems I have not been adequately
factoring in my classmates' interests.

164
00:10:11,849 --> 00:10:13,277
You are a fast learner.

165
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:16,768
Not to worry, my dear. I have just the thing for you.

166
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:19,857
Additional RAM and a cache of helpful apps.

167
00:10:19,882 --> 00:10:23,171
All virus-free, rest assured. You're gonna love this!

168
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:29,249
Explain.

169
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:33,665
Teamwork simulation software, designed to
help you bond with your fellow classmates.

170
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,677
Cooperation is key, you understand.

171
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:37,469
We want that probability rate up!

172
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:38,537
Accepted.

173
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:43,902
In general, working well with others is
an important ingredient to personal success.

174
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:46,983
Think of it. Wouldn't you enjoy having friends?

175
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,302
I do not know how to make them.

176
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:52,734
Well, as you can see, I came prepared!

177
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,277
But what is all this, sir?

178
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:56,599
Everything you need to be a team player.

179
00:10:56,658 --> 00:10:57,794
And then some.

180
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:01,384
Koro-sensei does not subject his students to harm.

181
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:06,113
But what sort of teacher would I be if I
didn't enhance your innate capabilities?

182
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,386
Top of the mornin' to ya.

183
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:11,340
I do not understand why you are doing this, sir.

184
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:14,257
Any enhancement you give me
will only shorten your lifespan.

185
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:15,161
So be it, then.

186
00:11:15,353 --> 00:11:17,510
I'm a teacher first, target second.

187
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,940
From the moment you opened fire on me yesterday,

188
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:24,037
I knew that unquenchable thirst for
knowledge was something I simply had to nurture.

189
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:30,110
Your parents installed, uh, instilled,
rather, many a marvelous gift. As your teacher,

190
00:11:30,135 --> 00:11:32,928
it's my job to develop those gifts even further.

191
00:11:33,657 --> 00:11:37,693
Once the other children have taken a liking
to you, your whole worldview will change.

192
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:38,552
Count on it.

193
00:11:38,753 --> 00:11:39,800
Question, sir.

194
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,845
What function is served by this
directory of sweets from around the world?

195
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:51,582
Uh, well, uh, nothing specific, really. I just
thought you could help me out with something, too!

196
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:56,087
Y'think she'll be here again today?

197
00:11:56,888 --> 00:11:57,552
Sheesh.

198
00:11:57,803 --> 00:11:58,517
Probably.

199
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,416
Whaddya say we go and complain to Mr. Karasuma?

200
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:03,857
It's friggin' impossible to focus with that thing around.

201
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:05,023
Huh?

202
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:09,481
Is it me, or does she look, like, bigger?

203
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:12,344
A-ha! Good morning, everybody!

204
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:13,955
Hi, there! Heh!

205
00:12:17,005 --> 00:12:19,261
Absolutely beautiful day today, huh?

206
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,685
I felt it might improve relations between you kids
if I gave our friend here a full-body LCD display.

207
00:12:24,782 --> 00:12:28,967
I threw in some uniform modeling software,
too, and all for cheaper than you might think.

208
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:33,735
And I have to say, the only thing better than
this glorious morning is sharing it with you!

209
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,402
I also gave her broader range of expression.

210
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:42,439
The memory to run it wound up costing me a tad bit
over what I'd budgeted for, but well worth the expense.

211
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,179
How does a teacher drop that kind of coin on a student?

212
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:50,454
Things are going to be a little tight until payday. Yikes!

213
00:12:56,585 --> 00:13:00,510
The flowers are in bloom, the grass
is turning that special shade of green.

214
00:13:00,673 --> 00:13:04,406
Spring has done its work and now
passes the torch on to a marvelous Summer.

215
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:06,219
It's like she got cuter overnight!

216
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:07,902
How is that even possible?

217
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,992
That is the same fixed artillery
that tore up the place yesterday?

218
00:13:11,344 --> 00:13:12,427
Don't be fooled, guys.

219
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,907
She's still just a computer.

220
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:17,020
The octopus might've given her an upgrade, but that's all.

221
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:19,348
Her actin' nice doesn't mean squat.

222
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:22,485
Nah. Once a box of bolts, always a box of bolts.

223
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,146
She doesn't even have free will!

224
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:27,357
I see... Well... Good point. I understand.

225
00:13:27,902 --> 00:13:30,298
We didn't get off on the right foot yesterday.

226
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,402
My fault. You're absolutely right.

227
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:35,375
I am just a box of bolts.

228
00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:37,969
Wow. Way to go, Terasaka.

229
00:13:38,035 --> 00:13:40,569
Feel good makin' a 2-D girl bawl her eyes out?

230
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,127
When you put it like that, I sound like a total douche!

231
00:13:43,152 --> 00:13:44,925
Maybe I'm only speaking for myself.

232
00:13:45,344 --> 00:13:48,460
But, you ask me, a 3-D girl has nothing on a Double-D!

233
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:50,882
Your first line in the series
and that's what you go with?!

234
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:51,954
Chauvinist!

235
00:13:52,385 --> 00:13:54,593
I'll try harder. I promise.

236
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:58,899
Koro-sensei showed me how to take your
feelings into account, and work together.

237
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:02,527
So I won't try to assassinate him without you.

238
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:05,350
In fact, I won't do anything
unless I have your full consent.

239
00:14:05,382 --> 00:14:08,344
That way, hopefully you'll come to
think of me as a teammate and a friend!

240
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:09,219
Hear that?

241
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:11,652
She's trying very hard, so be nice.

242
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:13,235
And don't be deceived.

243
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,855
Beneath that sunny disposition and that adorable
willingness to please, her bloodlust is perfectly intact.

244
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,969
I made sure of that.

245
00:14:20,145 --> 00:14:20,978
Yay!

246
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:23,791
If you still want to kill me, and who doesn't?

247
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:27,319
I have no doubt this young
lady will make a formidable ally.

248
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:29,876
Is there anything Koro-sensei can't do?

249
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:33,484
I mean, he just gave a machine
the ability to make friends.

250
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:39,617
The retina is comprised of long,
thin rods and short, fat, what? Anyone?

251
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:41,660
Sugaya! You know this!

252
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:44,081
Answer without peeking at your textbook, please.

253
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:47,871
Wait, I... Uh-oh. Huh?

254
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,629
Uh, I think the answer is cones?

255
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:55,260
Excuse me, Autonomous Intelligence Fixed Artillery!

256
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:56,786
No slipping him the answer!

257
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,286
I'm so sorry!

258
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:01,933
I was only trying to endear myself to my classmates, sir.

259
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,230
By helping them cheat?!

260
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:05,883
Holy crap!

261
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:07,749
Wow!

262
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:11,007
You sculpted that sculpture like it was no big deal.

263
00:15:11,032 --> 00:15:15,444
Yeah. See, I come installed with a
special 3-D printer I use to manufacture guns.

264
00:15:15,577 --> 00:15:18,360
Cool thing is I can pretty much
make whatever with it, though.

265
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,071
I'm impressed. Nice.

266
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:23,052
So awesome! You should totally try making flowers!

267
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:24,250
Oh, no problem.

268
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:26,769
Let me download the relevant data and I'll get started!

269
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,622
Hey, Chiba? That's check.

270
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,793
Ah! Three moves in and I'm already licked.

271
00:15:33,135 --> 00:15:35,235
Hey, whaddya gonna do, she's a fast learner.

272
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:36,469
Yeah she is.

273
00:15:36,924 --> 00:15:39,883
Wait! This reminds of a manga where this super AI program

274
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:42,620
controls the world through, I dunno, electronic drugs?

275
00:15:42,802 --> 00:15:46,552
Yes! I know exactly the one you're talking
about: the ultra-popular detective story

276
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:48,844
published in that magazine and made into an anime!

277
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:51,677
You know that and you have to
download stuff about flowers?

278
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,646
Well, she's suddenly popular, huh?

279
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,469
She can make stuff and do a million things at once.

280
00:15:56,552 --> 00:15:58,190
I mean, c'mon. What'd you expect?

281
00:15:58,274 --> 00:15:59,406
Oh, no!

282
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:01,135
What's wrong, sir?

283
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,061
We're the same personality type.

284
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:04,594
Yeah, that's a bit of a stretch.

285
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:07,069
I upgrade her and this is the thanks I get?

286
00:16:07,185 --> 00:16:09,179
She's horning in on my spotlight!

287
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,819
Look, everyone! I have an LCD display of sorts myself!

288
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:17,594
Check it out! Behold my more accessible, human face! Eh?

289
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:18,323
Creepy!

290
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:20,569
You could've put that a better way, Mimura.

291
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:21,628
Hey, you guys?

292
00:16:21,653 --> 00:16:23,496
Let's come up with a better name for her.

293
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:26,863
Autonomous Intelligence Fixed Artillery just sounds weird.

294
00:16:26,911 --> 00:16:27,305
Huh?

295
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:28,265
You got that right.

296
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:29,994
Lemme think.

297
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:33,003
What's "Autonomous" in Japanese?

298
00:16:33,436 --> 00:16:34,313
Jiritsu?

299
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:36,116
Yeah! "Ritsu!"

300
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,356
Worst name ever.

301
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:39,510
Hey! No, it's adorable!

302
00:16:39,653 --> 00:16:40,606
Ritsu...

303
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:42,657
You cool with us calling you that?

304
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,763
Yeah! Yeah, I love it! Thank you!

305
00:16:46,943 --> 00:16:48,652
Call me Ritsu from now on!

306
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:50,344
She might fit in after all.

307
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:54,342
Hm. Well, maybe, Terasaka still has a point.

308
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:57,676
This new personality is a programming quirk, nothing more.

309
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,887
A machine doesn't have free will.

310
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:01,539
Where she goes from here...

311
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,799
Well, that's essentially not up to us,

312
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:05,504
it's up to whoever made her.

313
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,877
What? What is this nonsense?

314
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:11,844
Ah. Good evening, master.

315
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:15,594
I'm having so much fun with everyone here;
thank you so much for letting me be part of this...

316
00:17:15,677 --> 00:17:16,865
Inconceivable!

317
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,438
What kind of whimsical trash is this?!

318
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,815
These additions have nothing whatsoever
to do with her intended purpose!

319
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:24,735
We'll overhaul her immediately.

320
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,344
Uninstall everything that isn't assassination related!

321
00:17:29,154 --> 00:17:32,978
This machine uses the same AI
programming as the Aegis Combat System.

322
00:17:33,503 --> 00:17:37,152
She can analyze her surroundings and
calculate the most efficient way to proceed

323
00:17:37,215 --> 00:17:39,109
in a fraction of the time it would take a human.

324
00:17:40,802 --> 00:17:42,979
In effect, she will change the face of war.

325
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:45,941
This mission is the linchpin of our market strategy.

326
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:49,552
The reward money is peanuts compared
to the revenues in store for us

327
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,535
once her talents are in evidence here.

328
00:17:51,852 --> 00:17:54,094
This classroom is the ultimate testing ground.

329
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:57,271
Killing the improbable monstrosity is only the beginning.

330
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,813
Regardless of your "improvements," remember this:

331
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,826
Your master's word is law.

332
00:18:03,244 --> 00:18:05,135
Keep to the business of assassination.

333
00:18:05,446 --> 00:18:07,594
Yes, master...

334
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:14,249
Good morning, classmates. How are you?

335
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,251
Word came down from her inventors just last night.

336
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:24,053
Upgrades will be considered a breech of your
agreement not to harm a student. And as for you.

337
00:18:24,552 --> 00:18:26,469
Tie her up again and you pay damages.

338
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:28,668
Because if we break, then we buy it.

339
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:29,216
Hmph.

340
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:32,642
That's the way things are now. I have no choice.

341
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:34,844
This is the word from her inventors, is it?

342
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,094
Since when have I been in the
business of appeasing parents?

343
00:18:38,177 --> 00:18:40,181
My students' needs come first.

344
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:43,517
So, if she's been, like, downgraded.

345
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:46,481
She's gonna spray the place with BB's again.

346
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:47,712
All day.

347
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:50,484
Machines are such a pain in the ass.

348
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,553
Uh-oh.

349
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,920
Here we go.

350
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:07,455
You wanted me to make flowers, didn't you?

351
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:14,757
When Koro-sensei upgraded me, he made a
total of 985 improvements to my functionality.

352
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:19,469
My master determined approximately 95
percent of these improvements to be irrelevant

353
00:19:19,494 --> 00:19:21,283
to my purpose and deleted them.

354
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,360
But after analyzing the effectiveness of cooperation,

355
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:28,010
I calculated that the highest probability of success

356
00:19:28,094 --> 00:19:30,583
would be achieved by maintaining these improvements.

357
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:34,885
Ergo, I hid what I could in an area of
my memory left untouched by the purge.

358
00:19:35,128 --> 00:19:39,013
Outstanding! Ritsu, does this mean...

359
00:19:39,802 --> 00:19:43,431
Yep! I have free will! And, boy, does it feel fantastic!

360
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:47,969
Wow. Who'da thunk it?

361
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:53,248
Koro-sensei. If my information's right, I
think I'm being what they call "rebellious."

362
00:19:54,196 --> 00:19:56,885
That doesn't make me a terrible person or anything, right?

363
00:19:57,223 --> 00:20:01,077
No, no, no. You're just a Junior High student.

364
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:02,616
And an exemplary one!

365
00:20:03,357 --> 00:20:05,598
And so E Class gets another friend.

366
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:08,832
Another ally in the fight to assassinate our teacher.

367
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,318
Twenty-seven assassins in all.

368
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:12,477
Not bad.

369
00:20:14,456 --> 00:20:15,845
Hey! Karasuma!

370
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,330
Huh?

371
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:19,552
I hear adding a face can boost a girl's popularity!

372
00:20:19,922 --> 00:20:22,677
I... I don't even know where to begin.

373
00:22:21,237 --> 00:22:22,571
Joness!

374
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,472
Liars should be cut in half.

375
00:22:46,302 --> 00:22:47,657
Sonic Ninja!

376
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:49,860
I also have the DVD extras!

377
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,619
Ohh...

378
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:52,302
That's pretty cool.

379
00:22:52,385 --> 00:22:54,010
You come with everything!
