1
00:00:03,532 --> 00:00:06,833
Our infiltration of the Fuma Denjo hotel is underway.

2
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:09,462
We're closing in on the antidote. Hopefully.

3
00:00:09,647 --> 00:00:15,278
Time is running out. Unless we make it to the
top floor, and soon, our classmates might die.

4
00:00:17,157 --> 00:00:20,197
Seem fairly average for a pro, if you ask me.

5
00:00:20,642 --> 00:00:24,025
And is breaking glass supposed to
be intimidating? 'Cause I can do that.

6
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,618
But I wouldn't call in reinforcements as an opening move.

7
00:00:28,172 --> 00:00:31,296
But then, I'm not especially
threatened by "a bunch of amateurs."

8
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:33,032
Ah...

9
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,893
All right. Put your money where your mouth is.

10
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:41,094
If you insist.

11
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:29,015
Nice try, kid. But, as weapons
go, hun, I'd have gone with harder.

12
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:32,523
I guess I'll have to do without.

13
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:41,910
Uh...

14
00:02:43,716 --> 00:02:49,298
This dude's grip could crush a grown man's skull
like an egg. He gets his mitts on me, it's game over.

15
00:02:50,998 --> 00:02:54,063
Heh. The odds are definitely not in my favor.

16
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,137
Nothing unusual about that.

17
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:59,768
But in the end, this is just like any other game.

18
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,476
Just like school.

19
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:02,558
Uh.

20
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:03,764
Whoa...

21
00:03:04,043 --> 00:03:07,375
Oh, wow. He's blocking like an expert!

22
00:03:08,882 --> 00:03:11,735
Those are your defensive moves,
are they not, Mr. Karasuma?

23
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:15,952
For assassins, self-defense doesn't often come into play.

24
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:18,804
I don't recall having actively taught him any of this.

25
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:22,108
There's no denying it, though.

26
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:25,025
These moves are how I handled their attacks in class.

27
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,203
Damned impressive. This kid's a natural-born fighter.

28
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:32,699
A cut above his peers, even in a classroom of assassins.

29
00:03:32,888 --> 00:03:34,280
I can dodge him all day,

30
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:37,172
but if I move in for a hit, this prick's gonna grab me.

31
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:45,776
Hm? What's the problem? Evasive maneuvers ain't
gonna win this. You have'ta come in for an attack!

32
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:47,262
Oh, you don't say?

33
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:51,907
And what if really all I'm tryin' to do is
keep you occupied? I mean, my buddies are kinda

34
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:54,849
hopin' to sneak by, so, maybe I'm just bein' clever.

35
00:03:55,675 --> 00:03:59,409
Aw, relax. I'm pretty underhanded on the best of days.

36
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,636
But this is one fight I wanna win fair and square.

37
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:07,074
No tricks, no cheating, no holdin' out.

38
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:09,959
Just you an' me. Now, like men.

39
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:13,198
Be my guest, hun. I like the cut of your jib.

40
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:15,073
See, this is what I've been talkin' about!

41
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:20,355
Two equals, mano y mano. A real battle to the death, hun.

42
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:25,481
Hm?

43
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:29,326
There's my in!

44
00:04:35,824 --> 00:04:37,455
Say goodnight, you little punk.

45
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:40,290
Oh, no!

46
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:41,951
Sorry, kid.

47
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:43,912
You're underhanded on the best'a days.

48
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:45,962
I'm underhanded, like, every day.

49
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,424
You son of a bitch!

50
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:51,032
He wanted to fight you like a
man and this is how you respond?

51
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:54,583
Oh come on. This ain't the place
for that, kid; get over it, hun.

52
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,864
Look, you can't get hung up on ethics. I'm an assassin.

53
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,606
This biz don't reward folks who play by the rules.

54
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:04,100
Hun, if you got a canister of gas?

55
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:06,866
Use it. If he was all that, he'd have done the same...

56
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:07,461
Uh?!

57
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:15,480
Uh... You.... Ah.

58
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:18,825
Guess great minds think alike.

59
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:21,532
Now what was it were you saying about me being "all that?"

60
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:26,216
How di... How did you not... breathe it in?

61
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:29,890
I... I sprayed you... at point blank range.

62
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:32,301
You should be paralyzed, hun.

63
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:41,021
C'mon, Terasaka! What are you waiting for?

64
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:45,201
I'm gonna need duct tape and every free
hand we got to hold this crazy bastard down!

65
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,306
Yeah, all right. Fine.

66
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:50,348
You've been yankin' this creep's chain all along, huh?

67
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:54,954
Fair fight, my ass!

68
00:05:55,726 --> 00:05:57,643
Stay on guard while you're taping him up.

69
00:05:57,904 --> 00:06:01,657
He's incapacitated, but he might be
strong enough to spring back before too long.

70
00:06:01,804 --> 00:06:02,987
Yes, sir.

71
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:06,977
Huh?

72
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:08,634
Handy, right?

73
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,107
Lifted it off that Smog weirdo a while ago.

74
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:14,405
Still, disappointing it's a "one-time-use" type-a deal.

75
00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:16,399
How did you see it comin'?

76
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:18,282
You must've held your breath when I sprayed you.

77
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,847
How'd you know to do that when my hands were empty?

78
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:25,282
No way you could've told I had anything on me! Ugh! Hun.

79
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,046
That's the whole point.

80
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:30,112
With you, I was on guard
against everything but bare hands.

81
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:30,818
Hun.

82
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:34,719
As far as I know, you probably were
lookin' forward to an honest fight.

83
00:06:35,135 --> 00:06:39,234
But you're also on someone else's
payroll, so you don't get to choose.

84
00:06:39,592 --> 00:06:42,219
You'd've had to stop us by any means necessary.

85
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:45,248
I would've done the exact same thing in your shoes.

86
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:48,051
In a way, my mistrust was a compliment.

87
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,688
He's really good.

88
00:06:49,991 --> 00:06:53,422
Yes, he is. And he's changed, for the better.

89
00:06:54,132 --> 00:06:58,241
The anguish of defeat had never
darkened Karma's door. Finals provided

90
00:06:58,324 --> 00:07:01,032
our cocky comrade a much-needed reality check.

91
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:04,174
Failure humanized the perspective of his former foes.

92
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,277
He suddenly found himself among their number.

93
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:09,146
His picture of the world altered drastically,

94
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:11,879
leaving him with a healthy respect for those around him.

95
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:15,347
He was able to foresee his adversary's moves

96
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:17,991
because he didn't underestimate his abilities.

97
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:20,754
Something he only learned through his previous failure.

98
00:07:21,422 --> 00:07:25,075
We must see our opponent, not
as an obstacle, but as a person.

99
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:29,996
Toiling in the shadow of defeat, we taste true victory.

100
00:07:32,472 --> 00:07:35,339
It is a pleasure to see you
take the lesson to heart, Karma.

101
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:40,132
I'm very excited about what your future holds in store.

102
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:44,088
Hm. Hun, hats off to ya. You're nothin' to sneeze at.

103
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:47,292
I may be beaten, but it was a pleasure to know that you...

104
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:48,466
Oh, we're not done.

105
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,358
No, I'm just getting started.

106
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:52,795
Mm?

107
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,199
What in the hell are those s'posed to be?

108
00:07:55,322 --> 00:07:56,698
Mustard and wasabi.

109
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:59,324
You never know when you're
gonna need 'em to shove up a nose.

110
00:07:59,456 --> 00:08:00,543
You do what?

111
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:03,459
Part of keepin' my guard up meant I had to play nice.

112
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:06,469
But, hey, now what we've got
you all bound up, I can let loose.

113
00:08:08,116 --> 00:08:11,315
You'll wanna hold still or that special
clip's gonna rip your nostrils off.

114
00:08:12,188 --> 00:08:16,032
Now let's see. You've got your jalapenos,
your hatch chilies, your ghost peppers,

115
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:17,664
those are a kick in the balls, right?

116
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:20,133
And a pinch of garlic for hearth-health.

117
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:22,318
Well, hun, what cha think?

118
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:25,125
Show us that samurai willpower?

119
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:31,032
So, uh. I notice Karma's still a sadist.

120
00:08:31,122 --> 00:08:34,199
I'm very concerned about what his future holds in store.

121
00:08:34,282 --> 00:08:36,936
Who walks around with this stuff in their bag? Ugh.

122
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,996
Can we keep movin', please? Someone'll spot us.

123
00:08:40,244 --> 00:08:42,074
'cause you stick out like a sore thumb.

124
00:08:42,157 --> 00:08:43,315
Ha, ha.

125
00:08:50,132 --> 00:08:53,174
Attention. The terrace is just up these stairs.

126
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:55,623
Might be tricky. This is the club floor.

127
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:56,545
Correct.

128
00:08:56,738 --> 00:09:00,657
The Executive Floor can be accessed via
the staircase just off the lounge area.

129
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,407
Unfortunately, the back entrance has a manual lock on it,

130
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:05,842
so we'll need to detour around
and through the bar to open it

131
00:09:05,907 --> 00:09:06,842
and let the others in.

132
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:08,677
So we're flying by the seat of our pants.

133
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:10,950
A bar's the last place we belong.

134
00:09:11,324 --> 00:09:13,833
Koro-Sensei and Mr. K, you hide here.

135
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,799
Leave the tricky part to those best qualified.

136
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:18,837
We'll unlock the door to the VIP stairs.

137
00:09:19,181 --> 00:09:20,800
You fellas might be out of your dept in the club,

138
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:22,282
but us girls'll do just fine.

139
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:23,367
Yeah we will!

140
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,908
No way. I'm sorry, it's too dangerous.

141
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,782
Ah. Well, plan B?

142
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:29,436
Huh?

143
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:31,032
Ah...

144
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:31,668
Huh?!

145
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:36,388
Uh?! Uh... huh?

146
00:09:45,281 --> 00:09:46,156
So awesome.

147
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:46,717
Yeah!

148
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,430
You can thank the CEO.

149
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:49,284
No kidding.

150
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:52,232
Thanks for the executive suite, mom and dad.

151
00:09:52,616 --> 00:09:55,902
And all the douche-yachts rubbin'
shoulders with me to get at your money.

152
00:09:58,824 --> 00:10:02,894
This shit is depressing. Lamest vacay ever.

153
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,251
Oh, be a man already!

154
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:12,657
You're here to protect us, not use us as a shield!

155
00:10:12,741 --> 00:10:13,612
Get in front!

156
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:16,253
I can't! Don't make me do this, please!

157
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:17,312
Stop it.

158
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:18,938
You look fabulous!

159
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:24,775
That's right. This is my life.

160
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,866
Quit whining. You're deep undercover.

161
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:29,949
We talked about this.

162
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:31,282
You won't arouse suspicion this way.

163
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:32,657
Did you have to say "arouse?"

164
00:10:32,741 --> 00:10:34,363
Relax! It's all part of the plan.

165
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:35,741
It is?

166
00:10:35,824 --> 00:10:36,881
You look stunning!

167
00:10:37,252 --> 00:10:38,384
No, I do not!

168
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:40,324
Don't be so casual! Tart it up.

169
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,349
Whoa, wait! Are you my pimp all of a sudden?

170
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:44,241
Where'd this outfit come from anyway?

171
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:45,282
Next to the pool.

172
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:46,994
Consider it an anonymous donation.

173
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:47,288
Uh!

174
00:10:48,342 --> 00:10:51,658
Hottie alert. First time I've seen her on the club scene.

175
00:10:52,061 --> 00:10:53,662
This place is disgusting.

176
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:56,241
Let's unlock the door before some tool tries to hit on us.

177
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:56,973
Don't even.

178
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:58,682
You're milking this moment for all it's worth.

179
00:10:58,752 --> 00:10:59,252
Yo!

180
00:10:59,438 --> 00:10:59,897
Uh!

181
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:03,957
How you doin', shortie? Papa wants to buy you a drink.

182
00:11:04,148 --> 00:11:07,572
Anything you want, heh, heh! My treat. For reals.

183
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:11,291
Go on, Nagisa. Don't be an ice queen.

184
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:13,944
Wha... I thought we had a deal!

185
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:16,504
The deal is we act natural. Now get in there!

186
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:17,870
We'll swing back around for you.

187
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:20,882
Ah... How did my life get to this place?!

188
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,192
Nagisa's a really cute name for a girl.

189
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:24,645
Anyway, I'm Yuji.

190
00:11:25,782 --> 00:11:27,394
Okay, let's make a break for it.

191
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:32,263
I think we go up the side stairs. Let me check the map.

192
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,716
Right. Should be just up ahead a little further.

193
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:37,782
Hey, hey. What's the hurry, doll?

194
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:39,991
You girls look like you could use a little company.

195
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:40,503
Ugh.

196
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,514
Is this what I have to look
forward to every time we go out?

197
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:46,109
Look, bro. I hate to disappoint you...

198
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,392
Yada?

199
00:11:47,903 --> 00:11:50,673
Hiya boys. Wow, you two are stacked.

200
00:11:51,348 --> 00:11:54,423
Look, we'd love to chill, but our
daddies keep us on a short leash.

201
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,798
Yeah, I know it sucks, but what're you gonna do?

202
00:11:57,181 --> 00:11:58,074
Helicopter parents.

203
00:11:58,157 --> 00:12:01,025
Huh?! Tha... Th... Th... That's a yakuza pin!

204
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:02,716
Not just any yakuza pin!

205
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,921
That's the emblem of the relatively small
but absolutely terrifying Shuei Syndicate!

206
00:12:07,882 --> 00:12:09,106
Sorry we bothered you!

207
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:12,322
Okay, bye! And that's how you
separate the men from the boys.

208
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,357
Why do you have a yakuza pin?

209
00:12:16,323 --> 00:12:18,345
C'mon, drink up! I'm buyin'!

210
00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:19,907
We're livin' large tonight!

211
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:21,907
Uh! I'm too... Uh, I mean,

212
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:23,770
I don't like the way alcohol tastes.

213
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,767
Keep it together, Nagisa.

214
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:29,444
Hold his interest long enough to give
the girls a chance to unlock the door.

215
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:32,066
So what brings you to this place? Your friends?

216
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:33,997
Your mom and dad?

217
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:34,973
Mom and dad?

218
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,628
As if the two of them would give me the time of day! Hey!

219
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:41,916
Wanna know a secret? Don't
tell anyone, but my dad's on TV.

220
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:43,156
Like, uber famous.

221
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:45,366
You'd know 'im if you saw 'im, trust me.

222
00:12:45,504 --> 00:12:48,004
He's huge. Paparazzi hound him all the time.

223
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:49,418
Dude can't get away with jack.

224
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:54,767
'Least not in public! One time, he was tellin' me
about this anchor chick he kept fondling under the table

225
00:12:54,814 --> 00:12:55,791
when they'd cut to commercial.

226
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:59,103
That sounds skeezy. Does he brag about stuff like that?

227
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:02,383
Damn it. Way to go, dumbass.

228
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:07,398
Real smooth. Can't you make an impression
without bringing up the old man? I'm so lame!

229
00:13:07,651 --> 00:13:10,034
Uh, smoking's really bad for you,

230
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:11,298
'specially that stuff.

231
00:13:11,362 --> 00:13:13,331
Heh. What're you, the surgeon general?

232
00:13:13,463 --> 00:13:14,801
Come on, it's cool.

233
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,177
People just need to loosen up every once in a while.

234
00:13:18,157 --> 00:13:20,539
My teacher calls this a gateway substance.

235
00:13:20,673 --> 00:13:23,311
Says it puts unsuspecting kids on the road to addiction.

236
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,648
Recreational drugs aren't the answer to life's problems.

237
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:29,172
Yeah, well!

238
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,282
What's your teacher know about my problems?

239
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:32,353
Guys have it rough.

240
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:34,883
We gotta be cool twenty-four-seven just to score!

241
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:38,835
You try bein' somebody when all people
do is compare you to your celebrity dad!

242
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:40,949
You girls. Y'all don't have a clue how it is!

243
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:44,436
All you have to do it put on a li'l
makeup, walk into a club and take your pick!

244
00:13:44,768 --> 00:13:45,286
Uh...

245
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:47,991
I can't speak for most girls,

246
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:50,586
but the ones I know have a lot more on their minds.

247
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:53,852
Oh! That's from Professor Bitch's pin collection!

248
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:57,609
That woman is something else.
Yakuza overlord, horse breeder.

249
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:01,646
Any pin you can think of, she's
got it and knows how to walk the walk.

250
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:05,633
Wow that line of work totally
fascinates you, doesn't it, Yada?

251
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,040
You're always picking her brain about different stuff.

252
00:14:08,168 --> 00:14:13,446
Yeah. It's like Koro-Sensei always says about our
"second blade." And, Professor Bitch has more than two.

253
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,875
I like an extensive skill set.

254
00:14:16,226 --> 00:14:19,226
See whatever job she's dropped into, she has a strategy.

255
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:21,373
That's what you call serious life-competence.

256
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:25,186
I bet one day when you grow
up, you'll be exactly like her!

257
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:28,650
Never thought I'd respect a girl with huge melons.

258
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:31,652
Wow! Kaede's made a real breakthrough, everyone!

259
00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:33,282
Okay. There's the door.

260
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:36,651
They have a guard posted, though. We didn't count on that.

261
00:14:37,574 --> 00:14:40,491
Not to be that girl, but I
think we might need a man for this.

262
00:14:40,574 --> 00:14:42,282
Well, damn. Okay, Kaede.

263
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:43,589
Go and rescue Nagisa.

264
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:44,184
Sure!

265
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:46,432
Get a load of that face.

266
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:49,617
Something tells me we'd be better off not engaging.

267
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:51,842
Hell, even if we could take this guy,

268
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:53,991
he won't go down without makin noise.

269
00:14:54,074 --> 00:14:54,915
Nagisa!

270
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,719
Uh. Oh, hey there.

271
00:14:57,872 --> 00:14:59,741
Well, uh, it's been nice, but, yeah.

272
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,698
Gotta go!

273
00:15:01,132 --> 00:15:03,466
Seriously? We just started talkin'!

274
00:15:03,574 --> 00:15:04,574
We'll do it again sometime.

275
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:06,199
Damn it! Do somethin', bro!

276
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,796
She's slippin' through your fingers!

277
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,352
Don't leave me alone like that again!

278
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,744
Yeah, yeah, whatever. Look, we've have a problem.

279
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:15,741
Just what we need. At least tell me I can ditch the dress.

280
00:15:15,823 --> 00:15:17,248
Not so fast, ladies!

281
00:15:17,392 --> 00:15:17,870
Uh?!

282
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:19,444
You can't leave! Nah!

283
00:15:19,616 --> 00:15:22,080
Not till you've taken in my signature dance moves!

284
00:15:24,461 --> 00:15:25,201
Really?

285
00:15:25,928 --> 00:15:27,259
This is it. I've got 'em!

286
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:30,088
No girl can resist the charms of my sweet moves!

287
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,324
Well, what do we have here? A regular tough-guy, huh?

288
00:15:38,407 --> 00:15:39,324
Who me? No.

289
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:39,987
Shut it!

290
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:42,241
I'm sorry, man! It was an accident!

291
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:44,032
This jacket's worth more 'n your life!

292
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:45,207
Where do you live?

293
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:47,551
Look, please! I don't want any trouble...

294
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:49,466
This could be our chance.

295
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,469
You're gonna pay to have it cleaned, understand?

296
00:15:52,545 --> 00:15:55,202
You can cut me a check, or I
can take it out of your ass now.

297
00:15:55,282 --> 00:15:57,491
Wait! My dad's good for the money, I promise!

298
00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:58,680
Just don't beat me up, I'm beggin' ya!

299
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:00,282
'Scuse me, Mr. Yakuza?

300
00:16:00,349 --> 00:16:00,803
Yeah?

301
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:09,806
One, two.

302
00:16:12,616 --> 00:16:14,905
Mr. Bouncer, we have a situation here.

303
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:17,683
I think this man's had one too many tequila shots.

304
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:19,799
Someone's gonna trip over the poor guy.

305
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:21,945
Thanks for pointing it out.

306
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:26,586
Upsy-daisy, leight weight. There we go.

307
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:30,193
All right, girls. Go for it!

308
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,338
You take those "signature moves"
back to the dance floor, okay?

309
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:34,632
You didn't see anything.

310
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,684
If you're anything like me, you probably feel humiliated.

311
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:42,421
It is hard being a guy if you
think it's all about playin' it cool.

312
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,406
Don't try so hard. Just do you.

313
00:16:46,351 --> 00:16:47,328
You really think so?

314
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:49,616
Word to the wise for the whenever we meet again.

315
00:16:50,032 --> 00:16:52,914
The coolest thing anyone can do is be themselves.

316
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:54,717
Mission accomplished!

317
00:16:56,966 --> 00:17:00,032
That was some rather questionable
territory you had to navigate.

318
00:17:00,148 --> 00:17:02,138
No one got hands-y with you, I hope?

319
00:17:02,357 --> 00:17:03,130
Mm-mm.

320
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,609
We held our own.

321
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,573
Oh, you changed out of your dress. That was fast.

322
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,059
Not fast enough.

323
00:17:10,313 --> 00:17:11,440
What's bothering you?

324
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:14,849
Nothing. I feel so stupid. I mean, let's face it.

325
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:16,324
You girls didn't need me in there.

326
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:17,908
I didn't contribute anything.

327
00:17:18,826 --> 00:17:20,784
You were comic relief, dude! That's big!

328
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,374
Delete that immediately!

329
00:17:23,685 --> 00:17:25,010
You did a lot, Nagisa.

330
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,872
I know one person who's better off 'cause you were there.

331
00:17:29,163 --> 00:17:29,684
Uh...

332
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,777
Not gonna lie. That dress looked good on you.

333
00:17:36,966 --> 00:17:40,750
Historically, an assassin who can pull off
either gender is a huge asset in the field.

334
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:42,934
I don't like where this is going.

335
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:46,076
He's right. 'Cept I'm not so sure I buy you as a dude.

336
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:48,132
I'd really appreciate it if we dropped the subject!

337
00:17:48,157 --> 00:17:50,324
We're trying to be stealthy. Keep your voice down.

338
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:51,387
Right. Yes, sir.

339
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:53,850
We're in this operation's final phase.

340
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:54,987
Talk to me, Ritsu.

341
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:58,410
Yes, sir. The VIP floor is just around the corner.

342
00:17:58,722 --> 00:18:01,414
The guests here don't rely
solely on hotel security, though.

343
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:03,457
They make it a point of bringing their own.

344
00:18:05,578 --> 00:18:08,502
Man, these guys look like they
eat rent-a-cops for breakfast.

345
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:09,995
I'm demoralized.

346
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:12,339
You think they're in league with our target, or what?

347
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:15,406
I mean, technically they could anybody's minions, right?

348
00:18:16,217 --> 00:18:17,567
Like it even matters.

349
00:18:17,802 --> 00:18:20,142
Either way, we're gonna have
to take 'em down to get through.

350
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:21,808
Excellent point, Terasaka.

351
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:24,908
And to that end, the weapon you're hiding in your backpack

352
00:18:25,111 --> 00:18:26,806
will more than suffice.

353
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:30,183
Tch. Great. You have X-ray vision in this form, too?

354
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:34,032
You'll have to take both guards down at
once to keep 'em from calling for backup.

355
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:35,657
Kinda figured as much, thanks.

356
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:36,809
Kimura, help me out.

357
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,279
I'll wait, you get out there and lead 'em this way.

358
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:41,823
Dude, are you crazy? How'm I s'posed to do that?

359
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:42,918
You figure it out!

360
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:45,420
I've got a good idea, if you're not a wuss.

361
00:18:48,654 --> 00:18:49,511
Help you, kid?

362
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:51,118
Oh, wow!

363
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:54,072
Not a single active brain cell in sight! Nope!

364
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:56,933
Just two big dumb walls of meat wearing clothes!

365
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:00,249
Somebody really ought to call animal control. Sheesh.

366
00:19:03,284 --> 00:19:03,951
Come here!

367
00:19:04,074 --> 00:19:04,991
Why you runnin'?

368
00:19:05,074 --> 00:19:06,241
Guess that did the trick!

369
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,022
Who the hell is the little piss-ant?

370
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:09,376
And why's he so fast?

371
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,132
Let's do it!

372
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:12,211
Right behind ya!

373
00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:16,359
Hey wait, why stun guns?

374
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:19,467
Well, I bought 'em to see if they'd
be any good against the octopus.

375
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:22,166
But I never thought I'd be usin' them on actual people.

376
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:23,574
Those cost a fortune!

377
00:19:23,657 --> 00:19:25,329
How'd you afford equipment like this?

378
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,547
Uh, I came into some money.

379
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:31,272
Odd jobs, mostly. Nothin' special.

380
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:34,911
Hang on. I've seen these guys before.

381
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,258
Expertly done, Terasaka.

382
00:19:37,637 --> 00:19:41,020
I don't believe it would be remiss
to rifle through their pockets, do you?

383
00:19:41,907 --> 00:19:42,284
Huh?

384
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:46,693
A bit of due diligence and one can find
the most useful of items on such gentlemen.

385
00:19:47,242 --> 00:19:48,574
Real guns?

386
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:51,905
That's correct children. Chiba? Hayami?

387
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:54,657
I think you two should be the ones to have them.

388
00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:00,922
Alas, Mr. Karasuma hasn't yet sufficiently
recovered from his encounter with Smog to handle a gun.

389
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,272
The reality of our situation is this:

390
00:20:03,363 --> 00:20:05,405
you two are our best sharpshooters.

391
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:07,282
That's kinda out of left field, sir.

392
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:08,200
That said.

393
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,725
I'll allow no killing. That I won't.

394
00:20:11,283 --> 00:20:14,157
Do not underestimate your skill. In the right hands,

395
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:17,513
a firearm is all the more
impressive for not causing injury.

396
00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:20,880
I can't believe this... live ammo.

397
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:24,180
But, even when we had air guns, we froze.

398
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,267
Shall we proceed, children?

399
00:20:27,245 --> 00:20:29,616
If our experience thus far is anything to go on,

400
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,265
the enemy's presence here is relatively modest.

401
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:34,449
By even the most conservative estimate,

402
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:36,150
we've thinned their ranks by half.

403
00:20:36,545 --> 00:20:38,132
Yeah! That's what I'm sayin'!

404
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:39,335
Who's he got left?

405
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:42,074
Okay, team. Proceed with caution.

406
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,632
The next stage of infiltration is
the VIP-only emergency staircase.

407
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,711
There's an empty concert hall on the eighth
floor we'll have to sneak through to access it.

408
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:54,478
This whole affair is leaving a bad taste in my mouth.

409
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:57,697
Thought I was hired to snuff
out some kind of "super being".

410
00:20:58,136 --> 00:21:02,622
How'd I get roped into playing cat-and-mouse
with a gaggle of pimply-faced twerps?

411
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:05,259
Disgusting. Oh, well.

412
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,342
I have just the thing to wash that taste out.

413
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:10,526
Huh?!
