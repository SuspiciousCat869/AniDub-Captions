1
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:11,191
Hmm...

2
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:14,405
The moon is all they're talking about in the States, too.

3
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,851
Does no one care about anything else?

4
00:00:17,782 --> 00:00:18,766
There he is.

5
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:22,015
Chillin' out back before first
bell, not a care in the world.

6
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:26,981
Readin' a Hawaiian newspaper casually
picked up from Hawaii on the way here.

7
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:29,881
Nice. Good work, Nagisa.

8
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:31,366
Thanks. I owe ya one.

9
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:32,741
Hm. You're welcome.

10
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:33,924
Best of luck, Sugino.

11
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:36,959
Heh. Ten billion big, here I come.

12
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:41,098
We are assassins.

13
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:42,259
Our target...

14
00:00:42,616 --> 00:00:43,696
is our teacher.

15
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:47,199
Top of the morning to ya!

16
00:00:48,145 --> 00:00:50,822
It's usually considered polite to reply.

17
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:54,991
Uh... Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

18
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:56,074
Good morning, sir.

19
00:00:56,099 --> 00:01:00,750
A baseball embedded with
government-issue anti-me BB's? Creative!

20
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:04,883
Points for choosing a method of delivery
quieter than the pop of a standard air rifle.

21
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:06,267
Unfortunately...

22
00:01:06,678 --> 00:01:09,248
Once airborne, the weapon gave me nothing but time.

23
00:01:09,905 --> 00:01:13,291
Ample opportunity, in fact, to
organize a defensive maneuver.

24
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,741
A quick visit to the equipment room, and, ta-da!

25
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,671
I had, pardon the pun, a handy solution.

26
00:01:23,056 --> 00:01:24,265
Tick-tock, children.

27
00:01:24,324 --> 00:01:26,433
Graduation will be here before you know it.

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,683
Right, then. Homeroom, if you would please.

29
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:32,376
Yes, sir.

30
00:01:34,364 --> 00:01:37,992
Damn it. Well, so much for my fastball.

31
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:39,652
Big shock there, I guess.

32
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:41,060
It was a good throw.

33
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,115
"April is the cruelest month,

34
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:24,347
breeding lilacs out of the dead land...

35
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:25,888
What are the facts?

36
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:28,407
This guy vaporized 70% of the moon

37
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:30,401
and plans to destroy Earth in March.

38
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:33,007
He can do it, the issue is how to stop him.

39
00:03:33,324 --> 00:03:35,491
Oh, and for some reason, before ending the world,

40
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,617
he wants to teach a bunch of
last-chance Junior High nobodies.

41
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,423
The Ministry of Defense was quick to make the
most of the situation. They gave us a mission:

42
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:46,187
Kill our teacher, save the planet.

43
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:49,271
We're onboard because the reward money is crazy.

44
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:51,121
Ten billion crazy.

45
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:52,869
Hey, hey, Nagisa.

46
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,191
I hear that you and Sugino's
plan didn't go so well this morning.

47
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:58,630
Hmm... You could say that.

48
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:00,964
Seems like it's really bothering him, too.

49
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:03,674
What's there to get all bent outta shape about?

50
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:06,359
I mean, it's not like any of us could've done better.

51
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:08,532
Cultural familiarity has...

52
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:11,372
The Japanese word for "unkillable" is "korosenai".

53
00:04:11,782 --> 00:04:14,082
So we've named our unkillable teacher...

54
00:04:14,396 --> 00:04:15,560
"Koro-sensei".

55
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:17,866
Huh?

56
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:19,889
Sugaya!

57
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:26,572
Not a bad likeness, I'll give you that,
but I'm a little hurt by the jaw line.

58
00:04:27,074 --> 00:04:28,351
You don't have a jaw!

59
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:33,116
That's lunch, people. If you'll excuse me,

60
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,613
I have some important off-campus business to attend to.

61
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:37,186
Tofu from China?

62
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:38,196
Actually...

63
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:40,601
I'm catching a ball game in The Big Apple.

64
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:41,573
Ciao!

65
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,841
He sure knows how to make an exit.

66
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:47,299
I know! That thing is startin' to get on my nerves.

67
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:48,616
Talk about unfair.

68
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,699
We're stuck here while he flies all over the world,

69
00:04:50,782 --> 00:04:52,424
he could at least bring souvenirs.

70
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:53,991
Think about what he'd probably bring back:

71
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:55,641
are you that hard-up for a mortar shell?

72
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,924
I just sayin' an exotic snack would be nice.

73
00:04:57,949 --> 00:04:59,741
It's not like he has to sneak 'em though customs.

74
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:02,116
You've dedicated a lot of thought to this.

75
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:04,436
So, hey, what's New York's chief export?

76
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:05,445
I dunno, booze?

77
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,782
Sucks we're not drinking age.

78
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,187
What about something greasy from one of those food trucks?

79
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:11,157
Man! New York girls are hot!

80
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:12,407
Especially the blondes!

81
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:13,447
Oh, yeah!

82
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:17,132
Damn! Can you imagine if one came
back with him as a transfer student?

83
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:18,872
Oh. Mr. Karasuma.

84
00:05:19,657 --> 00:05:23,132
Children. Any progress on killing the tentacled menace?

85
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,736
Define progress.

86
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:32,593
This is E Class, yo.

87
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,675
You gotta lower your expectations.

88
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,558
All due respect, sir. He's too quick.

89
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:40,370
Like so quick you can't even see him sometimes.

90
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,282
You've said so yourself, he tops out at Mach Twenty.

91
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:44,616
How do we kill something like that?

92
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:45,417
I don't know.

93
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,364
But you kids had better figure it out.

94
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:49,049
Seriously?

95
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:51,620
Seriously. You're the only hope we've got.

96
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:53,901
He teaches willingly.

97
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:56,785
Putting himself in the line of fire by choice.

98
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:02,630
If we allow that creature to live,

99
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:05,597
come March, Earth will be totally annihilated.

100
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,712
And, in case you need a reminder of how powerful he is,

101
00:06:09,907 --> 00:06:11,555
take a look at what's left of our moon.

102
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,780
That'll be our planet in a year.

103
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,767
In short, he's too dangerous to take lightly.

104
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:21,502
That's why this classroom is the last
stand between mankind and extinction.

105
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:27,136
If you give a group of outcasts and
misfits like us a chance to play hero.

106
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:30,251
Things are gonna get interesting, to say the least.

107
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:31,624
Can we do it?

108
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:36,591
It's a tall order, especially given
everything we don't know about our target.

109
00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:40,905
We can't even say why Koro-sensei wants
to blow up the planet in the first place,

110
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:43,169
let alone what he gets out of teaching us.

111
00:07:00,491 --> 00:07:02,706
There you are. This may come in handy.

112
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:07,532
Thank you, Koro-sensei. Wait, what-what are you eating?

113
00:07:07,616 --> 00:07:09,371
A coconut I grabbed in Hawaii.

114
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:11,634
Care for bite?

115
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,947
You shouldn't eat the husk.

116
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:17,245
Solid throw yesterday, by the way.

117
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:19,757
Hah. Yeah, right.

118
00:07:19,782 --> 00:07:22,199
Says the guy who could probably
throw a ball faster and farther

119
00:07:22,282 --> 00:07:24,577
on accident than I'll ever be able to on purpose.

120
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:26,102
Are you on a team?

121
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:32,070
I used to be.

122
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:34,748
And you're not any longer?

123
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:37,743
They, uh...

124
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:39,656
They kicked me off.

125
00:07:40,257 --> 00:07:42,452
Teams are only for D Class and above.

126
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,321
We're here to get our grades back on track.

127
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,174
Extra-curricular stuff like sports isn't allowed.

128
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:50,900
Sounds suspiciously like discrimination.

129
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:53,300
I'd have gotten booted either way.

130
00:07:53,815 --> 00:07:56,159
C'mon. You saw my pitch.

131
00:07:57,032 --> 00:07:58,075
I'm too slow.

132
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:00,339
I never struck anyone out,

133
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:02,460
wound up bench-warming most of the season.

134
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:07,003
I was so depressed I got just as slow hittin' the books.

135
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:10,118
That's why I got packed off here to the mountain.

136
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:10,949
Sugino?

137
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:11,674
Hm?

138
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,702
May I give you a friendly piece of advice?

139
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:18,269
Need to make sure these get turned in.

140
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,304
That's weird.

141
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:23,370
What do they have to talk about?

142
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:28,090
Holy crap. He's ticked off he tried to kill him!

143
00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:31,578
And now he's literally up in arms!

144
00:08:32,627 --> 00:08:34,064
Please, sir! Don't do this!

145
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:34,541
Huh?

146
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:36,174
He was just doing what he had to!

147
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:37,781
The deal was you couldn't hurt any of us!

148
00:08:38,424 --> 00:08:39,331
There it is.

149
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,692
I thought I recognized that pitch style.

150
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,426
You were imitating major-league pitcher Arita.

151
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,360
That's right. These tentacles don't lie.

152
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:57,327
Your shoulders are significantly less
flexible than your idol's, I'm afraid.

153
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,076
What exactly are you trying say?

154
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:03,491
That the famous Arita fastball

155
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:05,612
that you were trying so hard to copy...

156
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:08,607
is simply never going to be your thing.

157
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:12,849
That's not fair.

158
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:16,532
You don't know. How could you?

159
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:18,795
That's ridiculous. You can't just...

160
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,771
Look, don't worry about it.

161
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:25,189
I get it, why even bother?

162
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:27,938
Hey, we're just E Class, right?

163
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:30,972
We're just a bunch of losers and lost causes!

164
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,132
You misunderstand me.

165
00:09:36,157 --> 00:09:38,926
I base this entirely on firsthand experience.

166
00:09:39,532 --> 00:09:41,762
First-through-eighth-hand experience!

167
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:44,042
What is wrong with you?!

168
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:46,299
I even got his autograph!

169
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:48,449
You actually asked him for an autograph?

170
00:09:48,536 --> 00:09:50,161
After you assaulted him?!

171
00:09:50,574 --> 00:09:51,991
Unbelievable, right?

172
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:52,884
He's right, though.

173
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:56,462
Some of us are born with talent, some of us not so much.

174
00:09:58,144 --> 00:09:59,464
Talent is relative.

175
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:02,777
Arita's wrists and elbows aren't as flexible as yours.

176
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:06,566
Like I said, these tentacles don't lie.

177
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,039
Given enough time and practice, you could
become just as good a player, if not better.

178
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:14,487
And besides, why settle for being an imitation?

179
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:17,420
Next time,

180
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:19,866
try assassinating me in your own style.

181
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:23,067
More flexible, huh?

182
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:25,095
I never realized.

183
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:28,439
How 'bout that.

184
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:30,368
My own style.

185
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:41,044
Excuse me, sir?

186
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:41,834
Hm?

187
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:47,110
Did you really fly all the way to New
York just to give Sugino a piece of advice?

188
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:49,224
Why not? I'm his teacher.

189
00:10:49,602 --> 00:10:52,893
Well, it's just that most teachers I
know wouldn't go that far for a student,

190
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:56,875
and I mean, here you are planning to blow up
the planet by the time we graduate and all that.

191
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:05,157
Nagisa, the details aren't important.

192
00:11:05,336 --> 00:11:07,782
Let's just say I'm here to make good on a promise.

193
00:11:07,924 --> 00:11:09,483
One I don't take lightly.

194
00:11:10,074 --> 00:11:10,602
Ah...

195
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:13,491
The Earth will be destroyed, yes,

196
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:16,871
but my first priority is to you and your classmates.

197
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:20,978
Nothing beats giving you kids the credit you're due.

198
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:23,235
Not even me blowing up the Earth.

199
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:27,270
Koro-sensei...

200
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:33,799
Could you maybe not write problems
like this on the back of our tests?

201
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:34,500
Whaa?!

202
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:35,824
We get it. You're fast.

203
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:37,716
No point being all weird about it, right?

204
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:40,216
Aww... It's only a bonus question...

205
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,191
Honestly, sir, it feels more like a penalty.

206
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:44,344
Uh... Yeah, well...

207
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,174
Anyway, I hope my students take assassinating me

208
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:49,136
as seriously as I take their education.

209
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,478
Not that'll you'll ever pull it off, of course.

210
00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:10,199
Wow! Nice one!

211
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:12,168
Broke so fast I could barely see it!

212
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,049
All in the wrists and elbows,

213
00:12:16,074 --> 00:12:18,532
I'm perfecting a curve ball that plays to my strengths.

214
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:20,324
Between that and the changeup I'm working on,

215
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,199
I've already got a half-decent arsenal.

216
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:24,741
Nothing Koro-sensei can't see comin' from a mile away,

217
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:25,843
but what are you gonna do?

218
00:12:26,991 --> 00:12:28,439
I'm sticking with it, though.

219
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:33,340
Perseverance is key... in baseball and assassination!

220
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,101
With supersonic speed and, um, multitasking tentacles,

221
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:44,582
Koro-sensei definitely has the advantage.

222
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:47,174
Killing him won't be easy. Still...

223
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:48,587
Can I bother you for a sec?

224
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:51,059
I wanna take a couple test shots at you, if that's okay.

225
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:53,926
Glutton for disappointment?

226
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:56,110
He was such an awesome motivator.

227
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:59,178
The kind of mentor who really
knew how to light a fire in you.

228
00:12:59,523 --> 00:13:01,847
We were having, well, a ball with him.

229
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:10,461
There he is.

230
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:14,341
Hey. You think that ice really comes
all the way from the friggin' North Pole?

231
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:15,123
Why not?

232
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:16,879
He hits up every other place on the map.

233
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:20,414
Focus! Think of the money we're gonna split.

234
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:22,491
Koro-sensei!

235
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:23,268
Hmm?

236
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:26,405
I hope you brought enough shaved ice for all of us!

237
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:32,737
Are the children opening their hearts
to me at last? Such beaming smiles!

238
00:13:33,352 --> 00:13:35,127
Such little savages!

239
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:42,302
Not the worst tactic you've tried.

240
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:44,614
But your smiles were a bit too forced.

241
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,631
I wasn't born yesterday, boys and girls.

242
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:49,074
Now put away these silly anti-me knives,

243
00:13:49,157 --> 00:13:52,032
and take a moment to stop and smell, if not the roses,

244
00:13:52,116 --> 00:13:53,903
then these lovely specimens.

245
00:13:54,982 --> 00:13:56,549
Are these from the flower bed?!

246
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:59,972
For your information, sir, we grew
these "lovely specimens" from seeds!

247
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:01,331
No kidding?!

248
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,174
Why would you do something so mean?

249
00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:06,406
We'd been waiting for them to bloom for months,

250
00:14:06,915 --> 00:14:07,924
I'm so sorry!

251
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:11,324
Forgive me, children! Allow
me to, uh, get you fresh bulbs!

252
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,257
Don't plant them at Mach Twenty!

253
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:15,341
No, of course not.

254
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:16,662
Tulips need a delicate touch!

255
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:17,424
Delicate. Got it.

256
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:18,699
Stop trying to impress us!

257
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:21,324
He's going to a lot of trouble for a
guy who's about to blow up the planet.

258
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,329
Yeah, kinda seems like a conflict of interest.

259
00:14:24,354 --> 00:14:24,872
Drain the soil properly!

260
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,102
One step at a time!

261
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,782
It's probably too late for them to grow now.

262
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:30,511
What's with the sea urchin going all Earth Day on us?

263
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:32,345
Oh hey, Nagisa.

264
00:14:32,491 --> 00:14:33,977
What'cha writing in your little book?

265
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:37,239
It's a running list of all the
chinks in Koro-sensei's armor.

266
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:40,515
A good assassin keeps tabs on his target's weak spots.

267
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:41,308
Hmm...

268
00:14:42,268 --> 00:14:45,578
Wow. Is that kind of thing really a weakness?

269
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:49,257
Nagisa wouldn't put it in there if it wasn't.

270
00:14:49,282 --> 00:14:50,074
Thank you!

271
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,678
Every detail gives us an edge.

272
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:53,674
High: About three meters.

273
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,674
"Weight: Lighter than he looks. Birthday: Unknown.

274
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,097
Weak points: Unknown..."

275
00:14:59,096 --> 00:14:59,965
What the hell is this?

276
00:15:00,228 --> 00:15:02,046
Doesn't seem like a lot to go on.

277
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:03,881
Maybe not at the moment.

278
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:05,939
The learning curve is steep.

279
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:09,188
Most classes don't have murder on the syllabus.

280
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:10,952
We are the exception.

281
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:16,759
Then again, we are E Class. We're the exception, period.

282
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:22,321
The Ministry of Defense appreciates your cooperation.

283
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:28,430
My being brought in as the new P.E.
Teacher of Class 3-E is unorthodox, we realize.

284
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,884
But, necessary.

285
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:32,561
I'll be there chiefly to observe,

286
00:15:32,741 --> 00:15:35,317
and to offer the students tactical advice.

287
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:38,863
My teaching certificate is
still valid, so that's something.

288
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:41,285
You have my blessing, sir.

289
00:15:41,614 --> 00:15:44,455
Just see to it their education and safety come first.

290
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:47,411
Thank you for your time, principal.

291
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:55,140
I figured we'd meet with more resistance.

292
00:15:55,165 --> 00:15:58,533
Hmph. He's being compensated handsomely for his trouble.

293
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:02,285
All this seems rather convenient if you ask me.

294
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:05,907
A creature with god-like powers, untouchable,

295
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:09,092
beyond the reach of the military who wants to teach?

296
00:16:10,034 --> 00:16:11,742
Thankfully we've kept it a secret.

297
00:16:11,866 --> 00:16:14,782
The principal is involved and the E Class students.

298
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:17,882
But as far as we can tell, no other civilians have a clue.

299
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:18,975
I'm gonna die!

300
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:21,256
This is end of the world, man!

301
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,971
For you!

302
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,767
Stop screwin' around and get those grades up, man!

303
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:26,866
Have you seen the satellite campus?!

304
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:27,858
It's a nightmare.

305
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:32,632
No cafeteria, no food, bathrooms look like
something out of a horror movie, the kids are psychos,

306
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:34,466
the teachers fear for their lives.

307
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:36,216
Once you're there, you're basically done.

308
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:38,949
Colleges won't touch your transcript with a ten-foot pole.

309
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,739
I know, I know. Dude, whatever
keeps me outta E Class, I'll do it.

310
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
Surprise!

311
00:16:45,145 --> 00:16:47,505
Hooray! It's Kunudon!

312
00:16:47,816 --> 00:16:50,048
Hello, kiddos! That's correct!

313
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:52,657
It's Kunudon, your school mascot!

314
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:57,882
I'm gonna be telling you all about the sort of
super amazing things we do here at Kunugigaoka Academy!

315
00:16:57,907 --> 00:16:59,199
Yaaay!

316
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:01,616
I bet you already know that we make learning fun,

317
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:05,056
but I bet you didn't know we're one of
the top-ranked schools in the country!

318
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:07,862
Wow! That's amazing!

319
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:11,061
That's because we emphasize teamwork and equality!

320
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:14,089
Hooray! Equality!

321
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:16,389
Time-tested strategy.

322
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:20,782
Single out a group as undesirable and the
rest will fall in line to avoid being one of them.

323
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:23,846
Social engineering at its finest. Very effective.

324
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,246
Makes our job a little easier than it might be otherwise.

325
00:17:27,282 --> 00:17:30,574
Say what you will, E Class is ideal for our purposes.

326
00:17:30,657 --> 00:17:32,241
Remote. Secluded.

327
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:34,879
Full of ticking teenage time-bombs.

328
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:43,558
Hey, Mr. Karasuma! What are you doing here.

329
00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:46,917
New job assignment. As of tomorrow, I join the faculty

330
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:48,174
as a P.E. teacher.

331
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,468
Oh, that sounds cool!

332
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:50,893
It should be fun, yes.

333
00:17:50,918 --> 00:17:53,655
Then I get to call you Professor Karasuma from now on!

334
00:17:54,753 --> 00:17:56,711
So where exactly is your target now?

335
00:17:56,794 --> 00:17:57,752
Apologizing.

336
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:02,123
He messed up the tulips we planted so he's reduced
his speed and he's letting us all take whacks at him.

337
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,857
Is he totally the coolest teacher ever, or what?!

338
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:07,757
A few more minutes of this and all is forgiven, right?

339
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:09,616
You're a very lucky class, I'll have you know;

340
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:11,977
not many teachers would put themselves in this position.

341
00:18:13,032 --> 00:18:14,486
So, uh, any luck yet?

342
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,750
Uh... No.

343
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:18,236
This is pretty much all a game to him.

344
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:21,207
This is not what the Ministry of Defense has in mind.

345
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:22,782
Wait, hang on a minute.

346
00:18:22,924 --> 00:18:25,053
There's bound to be a corresponding weakness.

347
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:29,487
Shoot and stab to all you want, class!

348
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:32,020
Even with this handicap, I am too fast for you!

349
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:35,553
Only in your dreams do you have
any hope of getting the deed done!

350
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:36,195
Aww...

351
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:41,332
Kill him!

352
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:44,199
Wait, wait, wait! This isn't part of the deal!

353
00:18:44,282 --> 00:18:48,157
Easy! Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap...

354
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:50,782
Well, your notes are bound to come in handy at some point.

355
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:51,249
Right!

356
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:53,296
That's why I'm jotting everything down.

357
00:18:53,346 --> 00:18:55,341
My tentacles are all tangled in the ropes!

358
00:18:55,366 --> 00:18:56,741
This isn't what I had in mind!

359
00:18:56,999 --> 00:19:00,566
Stop it, stop it, all of you! Stop it...

360
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,782
Hey, get back down here!

361
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,174
Ha-ha! What's the matter, children?

362
00:19:05,294 --> 00:19:08,002
Can't jump this high? Oh, wait, of course not!

363
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:11,696
Aw, man! We were so close!

364
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,632
Guess who's earned themselves extra homework?

365
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,931
No fair!

366
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:27,826
Where's he going?

367
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:30,341
We're getting closer to a solution, I can feel it!

368
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:33,518
Keep this up and it's only a
matter of time before we got him!

369
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,695
A bunch of junior-high kids,

370
00:19:44,037 --> 00:19:45,329
keyed up about killing.

371
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:48,317
Strangest class ever.

372
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:51,542
So, whaddaya think? Do we have a decent chance?

373
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:53,281
Oh, yeah, no doubt!

374
00:19:53,665 --> 00:19:56,768
'Least I hope so, or it's gonna be
a really awkward graduation ceremony.

375
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:58,437
It's a funny thing.

376
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:02,407
The system's given up on these kids, and look at 'em.

377
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:03,920
If we lure him here...

378
00:20:04,324 --> 00:20:06,383
They've got so much positive energy.

379
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:08,654
So much... purpose.

380
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:21,319
As you can see, our situation is a desperate one.

381
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:24,925
Needless to say, this information
is shared in strictest confidence.

382
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,342
Break the non-disclosure clause,

383
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,629
and you will be subject to a memory wipe.

384
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:31,195
Yikes.

385
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:34,570
Your fellow classmates have already been debriefed.

386
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:37,399
They've done their best, but so far to no effect.

387
00:20:38,648 --> 00:20:42,413
Once your suspension has ended, you'll
report to E Class and access the situation.

388
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:45,678
From there, you are authorized to proceed as you see fit.

389
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,689
Whatever.

390
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,058
You expect me to take him down with this? Seriously?

391
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:53,900
Correct.

392
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:58,485
That knife, while harmless to humans, is
designed specifically with your target in mind.

393
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,631
Huh. Human. Not human.

394
00:21:02,282 --> 00:21:03,514
Doesn't matter to me.

395
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:07,923
Either way, I'm good.

396
00:21:10,574 --> 00:21:12,189
Should still be a lot of fun.

397
00:21:14,811 --> 00:21:17,211
I've always wanted to kill me a teacher.
