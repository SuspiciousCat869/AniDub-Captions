1
00:00:01,897 --> 00:00:04,356
Hey, Nagisa. You figure out who all's in your group?

2
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:05,476
My what?

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:09,216
It's mine and Isogai's job to keep track
of who's with who, so let one of us know.

4
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:10,078
Hm?

5
00:00:10,102 --> 00:00:11,314
You look confused.

6
00:00:11,397 --> 00:00:13,272
She's talking about next week's trip.

7
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:13,975
Of all the...

8
00:00:14,126 --> 00:00:18,233
Who in their right mind schedules a class
trip this early in the year?! Unbelievable!

9
00:00:18,564 --> 00:00:20,189
I cannot say that I approve.

10
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:21,481
Then why are you dressed like that?!

11
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:22,675
Geisha? Really?

12
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,112
It's actually kinda hot!

13
00:00:24,527 --> 00:00:25,853
Guilty as charged.

14
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:27,481
Yes, all right, I'll admit it.

15
00:00:27,564 --> 00:00:29,992
I'm as excited about this excursion as you.

16
00:00:30,587 --> 00:00:32,939
First midterms, and now a class trip.

17
00:00:33,022 --> 00:00:36,811
We have a pretty full calendar.
I mean, for assassins at least.

18
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:16,638
Everyone's aware next week is our
big, overnight field trip to Kyoto, yeah?

19
00:02:17,074 --> 00:02:18,564
Well, not to put a damper on the fun,

20
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:20,939
but you're still on the clock.

21
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:23,247
So, are we supposed to try to kill him there?

22
00:02:23,272 --> 00:02:24,689
That is the idea.

23
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:29,015
Kyoto is a very large city, a lot
more cosmopolitan than this area.

24
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,772
For your safety, you'll be touring in designated groups.

25
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,140
Koro-sensei will divide his time between you.

26
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:37,238
There are a lot of good sniper nests in the big city.

27
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:40,377
We plan to have sharpshooters
posted just about everywhere.

28
00:02:40,718 --> 00:02:42,439
Lead your target into the crosshairs,

29
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:44,231
and the reward money will be parsed out

30
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:45,994
between you and the lucky marksman.

31
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,231
So stick to the sniper-friendly routes

32
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:49,689
and keep those eyes peeled.

33
00:02:49,914 --> 00:02:51,164
Yes, sir.

34
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,099
So we're splittin' up into groups, huh?

35
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,968
Hey, Karma. Do you wanna be with us?

36
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:00,564
Count me in.

37
00:03:00,841 --> 00:03:03,189
Uh, you're gonna behave yourself, right?

38
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:04,606
No funny business?

39
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:06,561
No gettin' into fights and all that stuff?

40
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:09,272
Yeah. Sure. Don't worry, dude.

41
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,772
When I stir up trouble out of town, let's just say...

42
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:14,006
I know how to keep witnesses from reporting it.

43
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:16,260
Oh, great! And now he's part of our group.

44
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:17,057
Way to go!

45
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:19,731
Eh. What can I say? We've been friends for a while.

46
00:03:19,814 --> 00:03:21,506
So... Who else?

47
00:03:21,814 --> 00:03:24,564
There's me, you, Sugino, Kayano, should be two more.

48
00:03:24,647 --> 00:03:26,567
Yep. Got it covered! Okuda's in!

49
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:27,888
Still one shy.

50
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:29,840
You think our number six should be a girl, too?

51
00:03:29,865 --> 00:03:32,564
Heh-heh! No sweat. I foresaw this and took the liberty

52
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:34,488
of enlisting someone very special.

53
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:37,951
Ladies and gentleman, class idol, Kanzaki!

54
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:40,073
Ohh! I'm totally for it!

55
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:41,773
Nice girl, Kanzaki.

56
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,997
Doesn't exactly stand out in a crowd,

57
00:03:44,117 --> 00:03:46,334
but everyone in E Class is nuts about her.

58
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:48,311
Good addition to the group, I think.

59
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:50,272
Thank you for letting me join!

60
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:51,092
I'm flattered.

61
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:52,372
Uh, yeah.

62
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:54,913
Cool. So where in Kyoto do we wanna go?

63
00:03:54,938 --> 00:03:55,689
Good question.

64
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:57,647
Oh! You're all so cute.

65
00:03:57,731 --> 00:03:59,981
Excited to walk the city streets, boys and girls?

66
00:04:00,064 --> 00:04:01,647
Ah, so young and naïve.

67
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:04,274
Yeah, well, you can just stay here, Professor Bitch.

68
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:06,603
You can water the plants while we're gone.

69
00:04:06,682 --> 00:04:08,272
Where should we go on day two?

70
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:09,637
I vote Higashiyama.

71
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,897
Remember, we have to think about assassination.

72
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:13,997
But there's so much cool stuff on this route.

73
00:04:14,022 --> 00:04:15,814
Oh, no! If you bastards think

74
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,681
you're gonna deal me out of this trip, think again!

75
00:04:17,763 --> 00:04:18,407
What?!

76
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:20,831
You know, you're kinda giving us mixed signals here!

77
00:04:20,998 --> 00:04:23,364
Oh, I'll show you mixed signals, copper top!

78
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:24,230
Huh?

79
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,539
One for each of you!

80
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:27,991
What are those, sir?

81
00:04:28,272 --> 00:04:29,897
They're field trip guidebooks!

82
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:31,755
What the hell?

83
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,106
They're more like dictionaries!

84
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:34,850
Just a little something I threw together last night!

85
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,814
Including all illustrations of
every major tourist attraction,

86
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:38,231
the top 100 local souvenirs and where to find them,

87
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:40,022
travel self-defense techniques from basic to advanced,

88
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:43,456
oh, and best of all: the first
edition comes with a model of Kinjakuji!

89
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:45,675
You are WAY too excited about this trip!

90
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,242
Koro-sensei likes E Class to be prepared.

91
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:51,022
If the way things have been
going lately is any indication,

92
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:53,573
this is going to be an educational trip.

93
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:55,526
I'm actually kinda stoked!

94
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,429
Whoa. Man, look at those lucky jerks,

95
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:02,747
gettin' to ride first class.

96
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:04,472
And as always, we're stuck in coach.

97
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:05,998
Yay for us, right, guys?

98
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:09,000
Now, now, boys and girls. Try not to look so sour.

99
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:11,193
Rules are rules, you know how this works.

100
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:15,272
The student handbook states those of us with the
highest grade-point average get dibs on school funds.

101
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:19,518
Oh-ho! Is that the putrid stench of
abject poverty filling my nostrils?

102
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:20,932
Pardon me, boys.

103
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,980
Everyone having a glamorous day so far?

104
00:05:28,022 --> 00:05:29,314
Um, Professor Bitch?

105
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:31,231
Why are you dressed like the paparazzi should care

106
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:32,038
who you are?

107
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:37,801
When it comes to womanly wiles, a
femme fatale pulls out all the stops.

108
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:41,231
Besides, travel is no excuse not
to look devastatingly fashionable.

109
00:05:41,272 --> 00:05:43,170
You stick out like a sore thumb.

110
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:46,334
Go change. You're a chaperone, not a runway model.

111
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:47,647
Oh, come on, lighten up!

112
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,056
What's wrong with a little style?

113
00:05:49,138 --> 00:05:50,521
These kids are going to the city.

114
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:53,166
Shut up. Get changed now.

115
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:58,123
She's a more of a child than we are.

116
00:05:58,343 --> 00:06:01,856
Maybe killing rich dudes for a
living disconnects you from reality.

117
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:06,897
An excellent place to corner him.

118
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:07,423
Yeah!

119
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:15,939
Huh. Has anybody seen Koro-sensei?

120
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,647
Was he even at the train station?

121
00:06:17,672 --> 00:06:18,474
Holy...

122
00:06:18,727 --> 00:06:20,147
Not to pry, but is there some reason

123
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:21,530
you're stuck to the window?!

124
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:25,462
Uh... I was stocking up on munchies
at the terminal and lost track of time.

125
00:06:25,606 --> 00:06:29,808
It's all right, I'll just stay here till
we reach the next stop. Cloaking engaged!

126
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:33,981
Nothing to see here. Just some random
clothes and luggage stuck to the side of a train.

127
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:36,493
Worst. Camouflage. Ever.

128
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,049
Whew...

129
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:41,189
Who knew traveling incognito would be so exhausting?

130
00:06:41,272 --> 00:06:42,432
Goodness me.

131
00:06:43,022 --> 00:06:45,683
Might be a little easier if you
didn't bring such a big suitcase.

132
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,997
No offense, but you weird people out as it is.

133
00:06:48,113 --> 00:06:51,831
And while we're on the subject, broadcasting
that you're in disguise defeats the purpose.

134
00:06:52,553 --> 00:06:54,689
Truth? It's a lame disguise anyway.

135
00:06:54,772 --> 00:06:55,836
Nobody's buyin' it.

136
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:57,361
Hey, Koro-sensei.

137
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,442
Try these.

138
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,981
Can't have your nose going AWOL all the time, right?

139
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:04,146
Wow! A perfect fit!

140
00:07:04,914 --> 00:07:07,414
Custom carved to complement the contours of your face.

141
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,127
You're welcome.

142
00:07:08,357 --> 00:07:10,606
It's whatever, just a little hobby of mine, no big.

143
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:12,489
Whoa! That's cool, Sugaya!

144
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:16,969
Isn't it awesome how when you travel
together you see a whole other side to people?

145
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:21,720
Mm-hm! I don't know what we'll learn about each
other on this trip but I'm ready to be surprised.

146
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:27,066
Hey, guys, I'm gonna make a run to the main car
and get us some drinks. Anybody else feeling parched?

147
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:28,647
Uh, can I come with you, please?

148
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:29,626
Me, too!

149
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:32,065
Isn't this cool?

150
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:32,978
I love how space age it feels.

151
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,861
Sorry. Excuse us.

152
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:42,274
What school you s'pose they're from?

153
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:43,743
Kunugigaoka.

154
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:47,981
How'd you like that? A train full of smarties
from one of the best schools in the country.

155
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:50,122
Tell me another. Come on, her?

156
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:51,439
She don't look smart.

157
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,147
Hey. I have an idea.

158
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:55,481
Once we're in Kyoto,

159
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:58,217
whaddya say we have some fun with these dweebs?

160
00:08:01,423 --> 00:08:02,289
Nice!

161
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,256
So, bullet trains actually give him motion sickness?

162
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:14,458
You'll probably feel better if
you lay down in our room for a while.

163
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:18,731
Perhaps later... I need to pop
back over to Tokyo for a moment first.

164
00:08:19,272 --> 00:08:21,147
Koro-sensei forgot his favorite pillow.

165
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:23,633
How is everything you own not in that bag?!

166
00:08:27,022 --> 00:08:27,803
Any luck?

167
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:30,497
It's gotta be in there, you worked so hard on it, too.

168
00:08:30,522 --> 00:08:31,243
Mm-mm...

169
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:35,689
I admire your going through the trouble
of putting together an itinerary, Kanzaki,

170
00:08:35,772 --> 00:08:37,664
but if you can't locate it, don't fret.

171
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:39,106
I have just the solution.

172
00:08:39,189 --> 00:08:41,314
These handy dandy guidebooks contain everything

173
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:42,131
you could possibly need.

174
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:45,242
She made the itinerary so we wouldn't
have to lug those things around!

175
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:47,848
I distinctly remember putting it in my handbag.

176
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:50,014
I wonder if I dropped it somewhere.

177
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:56,147
So, uh, tomorrow is your free-study
day in Kyoto, everybody got that?

178
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:59,002
Hey! Shut your traps and listen for a second!

179
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:02,016
Heh! Those jerks from Kunugigaoka

180
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:05,564
are really gonna try to squeeze
all this sight-seeing into one day?

181
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:11,157
Nice spot. For assassination, I mean.

182
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,279
Don't you think, Nagisa?

183
00:09:12,356 --> 00:09:14,264
If the snipers can see it, sure.

184
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:16,765
What a bizarre field trip, right?

185
00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:19,277
Maybe. But you gotta admit it's fun.

186
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,911
Whatever we do, we have to get
green tea warabimochi dumplings!

187
00:09:24,403 --> 00:09:25,647
That's a great idea!

188
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:27,151
We could put poison in them!

189
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:28,430
That's twisted!

190
00:09:28,455 --> 00:09:30,830
Not for us, silly. For Koro-sensei.

191
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:32,106
Not too shabby.

192
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:33,689
We could take advantage of his sweet tooth.

193
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,414
That'd be a waste of a perfectly good local treat!

194
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:37,856
Now if only we could find a poison

195
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:39,616
that didn't give him special powers.

196
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,247
Not to be that guy, but I gotta tell ya:

197
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:45,356
I was sorta hoping we could
put the whole assassination thing

198
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:46,856
on hold while we were here.

199
00:09:47,347 --> 00:09:48,618
We're in Kyoto, people!

200
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:51,296
What do any of these sites have to do with assassination?

201
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:52,867
You'd be surprised.

202
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,194
Hold on, the Ryoma Sakamoto?

203
00:09:57,286 --> 00:09:58,911
This is where Omiya used to be.

204
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,014
The inn where Sakamoto was cut down by assassins in 1867.

205
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,769
That's right.

206
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:07,390
And just a little further down is Honnoji Temple.

207
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:09,939
Though it's moved a few times since they built it.

208
00:10:10,022 --> 00:10:13,303
Oh, yeah. Oda's death counts as an assassination.

209
00:10:14,144 --> 00:10:16,481
Just think, in these few city blocks

210
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:19,398
a slew of high-profile assassinations went down.

211
00:10:19,747 --> 00:10:21,894
Sure, Kyoto's always been the heart of Japan,

212
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:24,664
but it's also a Mecca for professional killers.

213
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:26,814
I never thought of it that way.

214
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:29,539
Guess you could say we're on an "assassination vacation."

215
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:33,112
Throughout history, tons of
targets have been neutralized here,

216
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:36,682
targets whose lives the world
still feels the repercussions of.

217
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,682
As far as that goes, Koro-sensei
is definitely in good company.

218
00:10:41,064 --> 00:10:43,189
Cool! Next up is Yasaka Shrine!

219
00:10:43,272 --> 00:10:43,754
Uh-huh.

220
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:49,522
Mind if we take a break first? I could really go
for some sugar-loaded Kyoto coffee right about now.

221
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:50,623
Yay, sugar!

222
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:56,581
Talk about off the beaten path.

223
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,731
Gion is a ghost town this far in.

224
00:10:58,773 --> 00:11:02,405
Yeah. Places like this put a cap
on the number of visitors they allow,

225
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,873
so you don't catch many people just wandering around.

226
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:07,559
Secluded, lots of good hiding places.

227
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:11,022
That's why I made sure to put in on the itinerary.

228
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:13,175
It's ideal for assassination.

229
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:15,899
Good job, Kanzaki! You really do your homework!

230
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:17,606
I vote this is where we do the deed!

231
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:18,981
"Ideal" is right.

232
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:22,542
It's also a great spot for kidnappers to ply their trade.

233
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:23,199
Huh?

234
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:46,731
I hope you don't take this the wrong way,

235
00:11:46,814 --> 00:11:49,022
but, something tells me you gentlemen aren't tourists.

236
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:50,939
Don't try to be a hero, carrot top.

237
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:52,768
Hand over your lady friends and wa...

238
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:56,064
Y'see that? What did I tell you?

239
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:57,772
To hell with 'em. Without any witnesses,

240
00:11:57,856 --> 00:11:59,971
it's basically a free-for-all, so go nuts!

241
00:12:00,114 --> 00:12:00,419
Hey!

242
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:00,913
Hm?

243
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:02,564
I'm gonna gut you like a pig!

244
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,106
Strong words for a guy kissin' the sidewalk.

245
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:08,642
Let go of me!

246
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:10,224
No! Stop!

247
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:12,390
What did we tell you?!

248
00:12:14,748 --> 00:12:15,772
Leave him alone!

249
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:20,992
Bring the car around.

250
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:25,459
Yeah, that's right. Don't mess with us, dweebs.

251
00:12:26,673 --> 00:12:29,397
They crawled out of the shadows like monsters.

252
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,822
Only these thugs are something far worse than monsters.

253
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:35,098
They're high schoolers.

254
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:43,039
Nagisa! Sugino!

255
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:47,791
Oh, thank goodness! Are you two okay?

256
00:12:48,246 --> 00:12:49,496
You all right, Okuda?

257
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:51,469
Those guys didn't do anything to you, did they?

258
00:12:51,494 --> 00:12:52,897
It's okay, I'm fine.

259
00:12:53,027 --> 00:12:54,897
Sorry, I didn't know what to do, so I just hid.

260
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:57,606
Don't sweat it. You did the right thing.

261
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:58,460
Huh?

262
00:12:58,731 --> 00:13:00,064
I think it's safe to assume

263
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,497
those guys are pretty hardcore. We could go to the cops,

264
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:04,848
except they're the type who
know their way around the system.

265
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:06,168
Which is fine.

266
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,911
'Cause I'm the type who likes to handle these things

267
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:10,721
personally, if you know what I mean.

268
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:15,001
Okay. Dude, how do we even find them?

269
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:22,218
I gave our buddies a call and they're in.

270
00:13:22,397 --> 00:13:24,772
We're gonna have ourselves a
li'l commemorative photo shoot

271
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:27,081
with you gals. Feel free to scream.

272
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,272
No one'll hear ya 'cept for us.

273
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:33,770
You. I seen you somewhere before, right?

274
00:13:34,004 --> 00:13:36,629
Sure I have. Last summer in Tokyo.

275
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:40,068
Saw ya in that arcade. Don't deny it.

276
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:42,772
My boys spotted you first,

277
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:45,189
told me to be on the lookout for a party girl.

278
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:47,632
We was gonna kidnap you then, but...

279
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,047
I guess you lucked out and gave us the slip.

280
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:52,064
Who'd 'a thought you were gonna go

281
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:54,747
to the school for geniuses? No judgment, though.

282
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:55,731
I get it.

283
00:13:55,814 --> 00:13:57,481
The higher you are on the ladder,

284
00:13:57,565 --> 00:14:00,066
the more you wanna take a swan dive.

285
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,331
Don't worry about a thing.

286
00:14:02,356 --> 00:14:06,200
Professor Ruin's gonna take all
night teachin' you to dive like a pro.

287
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:13,578
"When a Group Member has Been Abducted?"

288
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:16,939
I'll just say it, what kind of
"guidebook" covers this stuff?

289
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,725
The sort of guidebook an insanely
thorough teacher writes, apparently.

290
00:14:21,606 --> 00:14:25,647
There's even a section on how to deal with
seeing overpriced Kyoto souvenirs for cheap

291
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,147
in boutique shops back home.

292
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:29,022
It's like he's walking us through every possible scenario.

293
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:30,439
"Cheering Up Your Lonely Self

294
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:32,022
After Seeing a Lovey-Dovey Couple."

295
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:34,170
Specifically "On the Banks of the Kamo River."

296
00:14:34,195 --> 00:14:35,588
But that's not even a thing!

297
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,695
Well, at least reading this calmed us down.

298
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:41,364
I for one feel pretty confident about what to do.

299
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,589
So that picture...

300
00:14:45,356 --> 00:14:49,020
Not gonna lie, it's kinda comforting
to know even you went through a phase.

301
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:50,730
Never would've imagined.

302
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:51,479
Yeah.

303
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:58,733
My dad was crazy strict. Always on me about
doing well in school and building up my resume.

304
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,274
It was so suffocating, you know?

305
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:08,909
I just couldn't deal. So I'd ditch the uniform,
glam myself out, and hang where no one knew who I was.

306
00:15:09,356 --> 00:15:10,498
Felt like therapy.

307
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:15,162
So stupid. Where did I expect to end up, right?

308
00:15:15,486 --> 00:15:16,992
It's E Class for me.

309
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:21,653
But now, I don't even know where I belong anymore.

310
00:15:22,665 --> 00:15:25,331
Sounds to me like you'd be right at home with us.

311
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:28,501
Grades and all that pointless
bullshit don't mean jack here.

312
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:30,897
We eat elitist scum for breakfast.

313
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:34,381
Nothin' sweeter 'n knockin'
stuffed shirts down a peg or two.

314
00:15:36,232 --> 00:15:39,524
The only thing that matters is having a little fun, right?

315
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:42,770
You're a jerk.

316
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:46,914
I see how it is!

317
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:49,022
Little Miss Perfect thinks she's better than me!

318
00:15:49,106 --> 00:15:52,673
This is exactly what I'm talkin' about, you uppity bitch!

319
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:56,659
When we're done here, you go back to whatever fancy hotel

320
00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:02,188
you're in and tell whoever asks that you were
just out singin' karaoke and lost track of time.

321
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,991
Stick to that story, and no one gets hurt.

322
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:08,122
Once we're all back home in
Tokyo, we can all hang out together.

323
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:13,002
Maybe we'll scrapbook, do something artsy
with the "vacation photos" we're about to take.

324
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,722
Ah. Speak of the devil.

325
00:16:17,056 --> 00:16:18,879
My photographer buddies are here.

326
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:27,765
School Trip Guidebook, page 1,043.

327
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,442
"What To Do When a Group Member Has Been Abducted."

328
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:34,017
"If there are no leads on the perpetrators

329
00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:37,379
think back to any colloquialisms,
accents or linguistic quirks

330
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:40,077
that might indicate whether said perpetrators are local.

331
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:45,987
If not, and the perpetrators were wearing
school uniforms, refer to page 1,334."

332
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,903
Here we are.

333
00:16:48,038 --> 00:16:51,106
If the perpetrators are in school uniforms, you might be

334
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:53,689
dealing with a rival school out causing trouble.

335
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:54,942
You found us!

336
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,539
What the hell?! How'd you even know where to look?!

337
00:16:57,668 --> 00:17:01,897
"Being unfamiliar with the area, the culprits
will opt to stay within a narrow perimeter

338
00:17:01,943 --> 00:17:04,356
after the initial kidnapping, somewhere secluded

339
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,247
but not far from the scene of the crime.

340
00:17:06,414 --> 00:17:08,956
If this is the case, consult page 134."

341
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:14,532
"My Mach 20 bird's-eye-view map of popular
and or likely abductor hideouts may help."

342
00:17:16,623 --> 00:17:18,564
That guidebook is straight-up amazing!

343
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,689
There's nothing Koro-sensei didn't think of!

344
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:23,647
No kidding, right? Definitely worth lugging around.

345
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:25,522
We should take one with us everywhere.

346
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,802
You're getting all this from a guidebook?!

347
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,367
All right. So what's it gonna be gentlemen?

348
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:31,689
Fight or flight?

349
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:34,147
We'll go easy if you back down now,

350
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:37,326
but after all you've put us through,
you're not gettin' out of this unscathed.

351
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:39,908
That's a promise.

352
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:42,981
Heh...

353
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:43,747
Uh...?

354
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:45,450
Actin' all badass.

355
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,491
You Junior High kids crack me up.

356
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:49,981
Why don't you say hello to some friends of mine.

357
00:17:50,064 --> 00:17:52,606
See how far that attitude gets you with them?

358
00:17:55,737 --> 00:17:56,428
They...

359
00:17:58,182 --> 00:18:00,106
Say hello to them if you like.

360
00:18:00,189 --> 00:18:03,231
Be advised, though, they probably won't to hear you.

361
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:04,589
It's Koro-sensei!

362
00:18:04,731 --> 00:18:06,606
Sorry I'm a little late to the festivities.

363
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:08,814
I figured it'd be best to let you handle this on your own

364
00:18:08,897 --> 00:18:11,647
while I searched elsewhere, just to cover all the bases.

365
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:15,122
Um. Sir? Why exactly are you wearing a veil?

366
00:18:15,147 --> 00:18:16,897
Violence is always regrettable.

367
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:19,856
I'd rather you not associate
my face with what I've just done,

368
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:21,432
or what I'm about to do.

369
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:25,483
Good work following the
instructions in the guidebook, Nagisa.

370
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,889
I'm glad I had the foresight to provide them.

371
00:18:28,702 --> 00:18:31,077
Hold on! This freakazoid's your teacher?!

372
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:33,489
That's the biggest load of bullshit I ever heard!

373
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:35,523
Such language.

374
00:18:35,746 --> 00:18:38,671
I'll thank you not to use it in front of my students.

375
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:45,253
I, I didn't even see what he just did!

376
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,533
And unless you can move faster than me,

377
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:55,363
you'd be smart to keep your filthy hands off them, too.

378
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,731
Wow.

379
00:18:59,758 --> 00:19:02,656
So even the teachers they hire
at that damn school are special.

380
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:06,061
Prolly get off by lookin' down
on us like the other kids do.

381
00:19:06,106 --> 00:19:07,669
Well, look down on this!

382
00:19:09,078 --> 00:19:11,156
I think you have the wrong impression.

383
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:15,689
The school these boys and girls attend is special, yes.

384
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,485
But they're considered the outcasts.

385
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:23,861
Their class is the target of merciless scorn.

386
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,598
Even so, bleak as their situation may seem,

387
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:31,109
they stay commendably positive.

388
00:19:33,443 --> 00:19:38,051
Never would these children dream of pulling
others down to their "level" out of spite.

389
00:19:43,952 --> 00:19:45,043
They're not privileged,

390
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:48,300
they simply work hard. And there's the moral for you.

391
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:51,812
As the old saying goes, in clear waters or murky,

392
00:19:51,915 --> 00:19:54,568
fortune favors the fish who swim upstream.

393
00:19:56,732 --> 00:19:59,933
Okay, boys and girls, let's take care of business.

394
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:02,831
These misguided young rascals are in desperate need

395
00:20:02,856 --> 00:20:06,326
of a lesson in proper field
trip etiquette, wouldn't you agree?

396
00:20:11,321 --> 00:20:13,874
How are they behind us all of a sudden?!

397
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:16,828
What the hell did they just whack us upside the head with?

398
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:19,370
You know...

399
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:24,309
I'm starting to think we picked
the wrong kids to mess with.

400
00:20:26,554 --> 00:20:29,147
Man, for a while there I didn't
know what was gonna happen.

401
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:31,194
Should've just left me alone with the ringleader,

402
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,508
I'd have taken out the trash
before the bastard knew what hit him.

403
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,106
We get it, you're a scary dude.

404
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:39,122
I'm just glad we're okay.

405
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:41,459
How you holdin' up, Kanzaki? You good?

406
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:43,375
Sure. All things considered.

407
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,179
I must say, you're handling this quite well.

408
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:46,957
Huh?

409
00:20:47,052 --> 00:20:48,606
Most folks would've been traumatized

410
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:50,106
by what you just experienced.

411
00:20:50,189 --> 00:20:52,397
Yet, you've shaken it off without batting an eye.

412
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:55,897
In fact, I daresay the whole ordeal has empowered you.

413
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:57,667
What do you know? I guess it has.

414
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:00,039
Thanks for coming to the rescue!

415
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:01,481
Don't mention it.

416
00:21:03,434 --> 00:21:06,215
Why don't we carry on with our field trip, boys and girls?

417
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:07,856
Aw, dang it.

418
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:09,856
We never got to try out our assassination plan.

419
00:21:10,212 --> 00:21:12,414
Well, it really isn't the time or place for that now.

420
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:14,941
Whatever. We'll just try it tomorrow.

421
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,362
Best of luck to you.

422
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:21,611
When your target is also an outstanding teacher,

423
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:24,877
it's the definition of "between a rock and a hard place."
