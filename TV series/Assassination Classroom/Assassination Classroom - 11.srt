1
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:57,431
Okie-dokie, boys and girls.

2
00:01:57,514 --> 00:01:58,631
Time for homeroom.

3
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:00,846
Everyone take your seats.

4
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:03,444
Wow. Alright.

5
00:02:04,347 --> 00:02:05,541
Koro-sensei.

6
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:09,222
Could you please explain why your head
is suddenly 33 percent larger than before?

7
00:02:09,306 --> 00:02:10,472
Ah. Well, you see,

8
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:12,431
it soaks up moisture like a sponge.

9
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:13,597
With all the humidity.

10
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:15,392
That's seriously kind of gross.

11
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:17,443
Now, then.

12
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:18,847
According to Mr. Karasuma,

13
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,181
we have another transfer student joining us.

14
00:02:21,264 --> 00:02:21,995
Great.

15
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,251
Ten to one it's gonna be another assassin.

16
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:26,222
I made a bit more trouble for myself

17
00:02:26,306 --> 00:02:28,334
than I'd bargained for underestimating Ritsu.

18
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,838
So rest assured, I won't be making the same mistake twice.

19
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:37,347
But I encourage all of you to see the new
addition to our class as one more potential ally.

20
00:02:37,462 --> 00:02:40,337
Hey. Heard anything? I mean, since you're both new.

21
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:42,597
Figure you transfers gotta stick together, right?

22
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:44,383
Actually, I do know a little bit.

23
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:47,139
The original plan was for he
and I to start at the same time,

24
00:02:47,222 --> 00:02:48,658
but it didn't work out that way.

25
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:50,972
I would handle long-range attacks,

26
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:52,722
he would focus on close-range.

27
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,904
Our combined efforts were to
back Koro-sensei into a corner.

28
00:02:57,014 --> 00:03:01,282
Except, our masters recalled the order for, well, reasons.

29
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,389
Yeah? And those were?

30
00:03:03,472 --> 00:03:04,889
For one, my counterpart needed

31
00:03:04,972 --> 00:03:07,432
a few tweaks before being put into the field.

32
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:10,431
Second, it was deemed I lacked the capacity

33
00:03:10,514 --> 00:03:12,214
to support someone of his skill.

34
00:03:14,198 --> 00:03:16,592
Compared to what he's capable of, well...

35
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:18,966
Let's just say that I don't quite measure up.

36
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:24,949
For her to say that, when she
blew off Koro-sensei's fingers. Whoa.

37
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:27,166
What kind of beast must this new guy be?

38
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:40,806
Okay.

39
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,222
Somebody likes to wear white.

40
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:44,533
He, uhs, kinda tall for a kid.

41
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,857
Sorry, everyone.

42
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:54,181
Didn't meant to startle you.

43
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:55,847
I can see that you're confused.

44
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:58,326
I'm not your new classmate, just his guardian.

45
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:00,306
But let's not stand on ceremony.

46
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:01,821
Call me Shiro, please.

47
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:04,181
I don't know what's creepier, a guy in all white,

48
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:06,001
or a guy in all white doing magic.

49
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:06,747
Yeah.

50
00:04:07,252 --> 00:04:09,273
That entrance even freaked out Koro-sen...

51
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,139
Oh, come on! Give us a break!

52
00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:15,724
That really scared you enough to use the liquefy trick?

53
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:20,071
My imagination just ran a little
wild after Ritsu's story, that's all.

54
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:22,181
Nice to meet you, Mr. Shiro.

55
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:24,392
When might we get to greet your, uh, ward?

56
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,465
It's an honor, Koro-sensei.

57
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:30,185
Apologies for my "ward," as you
call him, being late for class.

58
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:33,264
I beg your patience, he'll be here in due course.

59
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:34,451
When the time is right.

60
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:35,474
Uh.

61
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:39,410
Not much for straight answers, is he?

62
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:40,761
Huh?

63
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:44,160
Something wrong?

64
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:45,226
Not at all.

65
00:04:45,514 --> 00:04:47,069
This seems an interesting group.

66
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,987
I'm confident he'll fit in perfectly.

67
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:52,132
Allow me to introduce him.

68
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,635
Now, Itona! Come!

69
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,694
Victory is mine.

70
00:05:07,514 --> 00:05:10,292
I have proven myself stronger than the classroom wall.

71
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:13,472
Come on! Use the door next time!

72
00:05:13,556 --> 00:05:16,793
Only strength matters. Everything else is crap.

73
00:05:17,222 --> 00:05:17,847
Awesome.

74
00:05:17,872 --> 00:05:19,159
He's gonna be a douche.

75
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:21,931
Even Koro-sensei's not sure how to react.

76
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,927
Is he smiling or cringing?

77
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:26,389
I don't think there's a name for that face.

78
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:28,472
I give you Itona Horibe.

79
00:05:28,556 --> 00:05:30,316
Or, if you prefer, just Itona.

80
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:32,431
A guardian in all white.

81
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:35,090
A transfer student impossible to read.

82
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:37,894
Something tells me we're in for stormy weather.

83
00:05:38,722 --> 00:05:40,000
Hey, new kid.

84
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:42,144
Mind if I ask you a question?

85
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:45,172
You came in from the rain without an umbrella.

86
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,650
It's coming down in buckets out there,

87
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,629
and somehow there's not a drop on you.

88
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:51,512
What's the story with that?

89
00:05:57,347 --> 00:05:57,737
Hm?

90
00:05:57,762 --> 00:06:00,029
You're the strongest one in this class, aren't you?

91
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:02,779
But you don't have to worry.

92
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:05,415
You're still weaker than me.

93
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:07,616
That means you get to live.

94
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:10,793
You're beneath my skill.

95
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,552
And I only kill things that are stronger than me.

96
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,539
And in this case, Koro-sensei.

97
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:19,342
That means you.

98
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:20,662
Ah.

99
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:23,640
I believe I'm starting to get
a clearer picture of your MO.

100
00:06:23,764 --> 00:06:25,056
Well, look no further.

101
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,915
I'm stronger than you by a whole order of magnitude.

102
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,266
Yeah. Sure.

103
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,260
Not so much.

104
00:06:32,064 --> 00:06:34,270
Truth is you an' me are actually brothers.

105
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:41,261
Brothers?!

106
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:46,807
Winner takes all, loser dies. Big bro.

107
00:06:50,514 --> 00:06:54,597
We siblings have to keep it real. No tricks. No bull.

108
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:55,885
Just the two of us.

109
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:58,248
After school.

110
00:06:58,763 --> 00:07:00,504
We face off in this classroom.

111
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:04,722
What is going on, sir?

112
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:05,972
Why did he say you were brothers?!

113
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:08,606
How do an octopus and a person come from the same mom?!

114
00:07:08,972 --> 00:07:10,347
I have no earthly idea!

115
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,639
The boy is clearly confused!

116
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,177
I was raised an only child!

117
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:14,913
When I asked my parents for siblings,

118
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:17,222
they gave me a talking-to about the birds and the bees!

119
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:18,622
When two cephalopods love each other very...

120
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,270
Wait, you actually had parents?

121
00:07:26,323 --> 00:07:28,487
Is this Itona kid telling the truth,

122
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,556
or is his story just some kind of tactic

123
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,991
to shake up his target?

124
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:33,126
Hm?

125
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:36,488
I apologize for throwing you off, Mr. Karasuma.

126
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:40,515
It was necessary to keep my ward's existence classified.

127
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:44,169
Unfortunately, I'm afraid that
meant you had to be kept in the dark.

128
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:46,576
Improbable as it may seem, though,

129
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:49,858
I can guarantee you they are, in fact, brothers.

130
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:54,640
Their little contest after school this
afternoon will leave no room for doubt.

131
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,932
Ugh. He's wolfin' the junk
food like it's goin' out of style.

132
00:07:58,056 --> 00:08:00,282
He's definitely got Koro-sensei's sweet tooth.

133
00:08:00,956 --> 00:08:03,532
And both their faces are equally hard to read.

134
00:08:04,306 --> 00:08:04,923
Wonderful.

135
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,681
Itona's comment has the whole class comparing
us in every detail. I need a distraction.

136
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:11,431
Ah, yes! I'll take my mind off things

137
00:08:11,514 --> 00:08:13,669
by poring over this girly magazine!

138
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:16,222
Nothing like a little adult reading material.

139
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:20,306
This cinches it!

140
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:21,899
They're both boob guys!

141
00:08:22,181 --> 00:08:24,889
Okay, the new kid's credibility just shot the roof!

142
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:27,222
So. That's really all it took, huh?

143
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,264
Hell yeah!

144
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:31,097
We boob men are all brothers!

145
00:08:31,181 --> 00:08:32,639
Now there's three of them?

146
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:35,186
Here's the thing, if they really are related. I mean,

147
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:37,790
don't you think Koro-sensei would've known about it?

148
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:40,662
Hmm... Not necessarily.

149
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:46,264
Your Highness, the enemy is upon us.

150
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:47,681
All is lost!

151
00:08:47,764 --> 00:08:48,628
So be it.

152
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:49,834
My sons.

153
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:51,797
You alone will survive!

154
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:54,222
Hurry, little brother! We've no time!

155
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:56,293
Clear the bridge and escape is assured!

156
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:00,931
Brother!

157
00:09:01,014 --> 00:09:02,347
Go! I'm lost!

158
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,870
Leave me! You have to live!

159
00:09:03,895 --> 00:09:04,764
No, brother!

160
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:07,153
You have to live!

161
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:10,298
Once grown, each was driven by
cruel fate to battle the other,

162
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:12,431
without knowing their opponent's true identity.

163
00:09:12,474 --> 00:09:12,929
Um.

164
00:09:12,954 --> 00:09:15,472
That still doesn't explain why Itona's human.

165
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,358
Easy, he's a mutation.

166
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:20,009
You've totally glossed over the core issue here!

167
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:24,431
No offense, but your characterizations are
kind of cliché. And the plot's ridiculous.

168
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:26,144
Hey! No one asked for your criticism.

169
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:28,545
If you hadn't noticed, we're
sorta dealing with real life here.

170
00:09:28,597 --> 00:09:30,147
Realism is your friend!

171
00:09:43,806 --> 00:09:45,426
This place looks like an arena.

172
00:09:45,556 --> 00:09:47,792
Yeah. Fit for an honest death match.

173
00:09:48,306 --> 00:09:51,161
It's the first time I've seen
an assassin take this approach.

174
00:09:51,847 --> 00:09:53,847
Surely by now you're tired of clunky,

175
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:55,847
overly complicated attempts on your life,

176
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:57,867
so let's confine ourselves to one rule.

177
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:02,038
Set foot outside the desk
boundary and your life is forfeit.

178
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:03,269
Agreed?

179
00:10:03,597 --> 00:10:05,097
Oh yeah, sure, whatever.

180
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:07,556
As if the loser's gonna stick to that without any issues.

181
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,290
They will.

182
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:11,297
Koro-sensei's all about how
his students see him, remember?

183
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:13,486
He'll abide by the rules out of a sense of honor.

184
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,020
Cheating would risk throwing
shade on his reputation with us.

185
00:10:18,673 --> 00:10:19,715
Very well, sir.

186
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:21,199
I agree to your rule.

187
00:10:21,782 --> 00:10:26,141
But let's include another, injuring
any spectators also counts as a forfeit.

188
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:28,613
Agreed.

189
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:32,323
Commence on my signal. Assassination.

190
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:37,065
Begin!

191
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:47,348
For what seemed like an eternity, our
eyes were all riveted to the same thing.

192
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:50,034
And, oddly enough, it wasn't our teacher's amputated limb.

193
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:51,907
Impossible!

194
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:58,977
He has...

195
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:12,829
Itona's hair is made of... tentacles!

196
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,558
That's how he stayed dry.

197
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:17,592
Sneaky bastard didn't need an umbrella after all.

198
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:20,079
He just batted the raindrops off.

199
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:23,064
How is this possible?

200
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:27,347
Tell me where those tentacles came from.

201
00:11:28,503 --> 00:11:31,292
Why does someone like you have them?

202
00:11:31,597 --> 00:11:34,199
We're neither at liberty or obligated to say.

203
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,169
But I hope this serves to convince you:

204
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,881
You may have come from different
parents, enjoyed different upbringings,

205
00:11:40,347 --> 00:11:43,290
but nevertheless you are indeed brothers.

206
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:46,259
What a face you're making.

207
00:11:46,737 --> 00:11:49,693
Does this encounter stir up unpleasant memories, perhaps?

208
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:53,720
Clearly.

209
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,876
You and I need to have a little talk.

210
00:11:58,434 --> 00:11:59,257
Not possible.

211
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:00,816
You'll be dead.

212
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:03,295
This pressure ray

213
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,541
has a very useful effect at close range.

214
00:12:05,978 --> 00:12:08,792
It triggers the dilatant properties of your skin cells.

215
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:11,619
You become stiff as a board instantaneously.

216
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:12,620
That's right,

217
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:16,059
Itona and I are on intimate
terms with your every weakness.

218
00:12:17,847 --> 00:12:19,015
Whoa! Did he get him?

219
00:12:19,317 --> 00:12:21,188
No. Look up!

220
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,666
Shedding your skin.

221
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:28,828
Ah, yes. We know about that little trick, too.

222
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:34,566
You see, Koro-sensei, there's an aspect
even to that which constitutes an Achilles Heel.

223
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:38,035
Molting costs you dearly in terms of energy.

224
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:40,882
That prodigious speed plummets while you recover.

225
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:44,014
Oh, and look! You've grown back that arm

226
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,083
Itona lobbed off

227
00:12:45,147 --> 00:12:48,209
in his initial attack! That's
even more energy you've lost.

228
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:51,139
By my calculations, at the moment this makes

229
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:53,997
the two of you a fairly even match for one other.

230
00:12:54,222 --> 00:12:58,263
Using one's tentacles effectively calls
for a great deal of mental stamina, too.

231
00:12:58,514 --> 00:13:01,514
And it appears Itona's dirty
little secret pulled the rug out

232
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:05,095
from under your state of mind,
which, of course, was the idea.

233
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:08,178
Not to boast, but it's obvious who has the upper hand.

234
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,073
Oh, also. He has the help of his devoted guardian.

235
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:25,268
Uh-oh!

236
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:27,729
You'll have to grow those pesky legs back now too!

237
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:30,202
That's an even bigger energy deficit.

238
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:32,130
That was easier than I thought.

239
00:13:32,253 --> 00:13:35,127
Look at you. Not so tough now, huh?

240
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,059
He's got Koro-sensei on the ropes!

241
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:42,040
If they actually kill him, they'll save the world!

242
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:45,798
But... it's hard to get excited about that.

243
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:48,855
They not only know his weak points,

244
00:13:49,014 --> 00:13:51,518
they know how to zero in on them one after the other.

245
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:53,281
And that's cool and all,

246
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:56,246
but... we were hoping to pull this off ourselves.

247
00:13:57,087 --> 00:14:00,289
If anyone gets to kill him, it should be us!

248
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:02,855
I see that your legs have regenerated.

249
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:05,947
Feeling ready for the next onslaught, are we?

250
00:14:07,197 --> 00:14:09,714
No one's ever run me this ragged before.

251
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:13,670
And here I thought I was signing
up for a garden variety face-off.

252
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:15,764
There's quite a bit more strategy afoot

253
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:16,927
than I'd suspected.

254
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:20,034
I have so many questions for the pair of you.

255
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:21,639
Of course, if I lose,

256
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:24,331
there won't be much opportunity to pick your brain.

257
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,833
Still think you can win?

258
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:28,337
Your confidence doesn't strike you as misguided?

259
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:29,247
Mr. Shiro.

260
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:33,356
For all your planning, there's one thing
you don't seem to have taken into account.

261
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:34,395
Not likely.

262
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:37,911
No detail is overlooked, no angle is unconsidered.

263
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,715
Finish him.

264
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:51,089
What do we have here?

265
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,264
Hmm. I seem to be standing in something you dropped.

266
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:54,831
Uh?

267
00:14:55,806 --> 00:14:56,371
Uh.

268
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,137
How did I miss that?

269
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:05,969
An anti-me blade works just as well
on your tentacles as they do mine.

270
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,863
And regeneration takes just as much a toll.

271
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:13,161
You may be exceptionally strong,
but I'm exceptionally clever.

272
00:15:18,347 --> 00:15:20,306
Don't worry, children. He's fine.

273
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:22,514
My old skin kept him perfectly safe.

274
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,658
Technically though, Itona, you are outside the boundary.

275
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:30,628
In yo' face. I win. Nyah-nyah na-boo-boo.

276
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,316
Etcetera, etcetera.

277
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:35,883
No more trying to kill me with your guardian's help, hmmm?

278
00:15:36,758 --> 00:15:39,431
If, however, you'd like to
stay, perhaps learn a thing or two

279
00:15:39,514 --> 00:15:42,469
along with the rest of the class,
we'll welcome you with open arms.

280
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,386
Bear in mind, what you learn here
can't necessarily be quantified.

281
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:50,508
You are a gifted young man, but I am richer in experience.

282
00:15:50,764 --> 00:15:53,639
I became a teacher so as to translate that experience

283
00:15:53,722 --> 00:15:56,437
into something which can enrich others.

284
00:15:56,928 --> 00:16:00,428
The way to assassinate me isn't
by honing in on my weaknesses,

285
00:16:00,472 --> 00:16:02,585
but by absorbing my lessons.

286
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:06,700
Are you saying that I'm never
gonna be strong enough to beat you?

287
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,512
You think that I'm weak?!

288
00:16:09,104 --> 00:16:10,084
Oh, no.

289
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,643
Itona is not a fan of being lectured to.

290
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:16,273
If Koro-sensei continues to lord his knowledge over him.

291
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,059
Genocide is in the air!

292
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:21,639
Black tentacles?

293
00:16:21,722 --> 00:16:23,764
I think the dude's about to go postal!

294
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:25,039
I am strong!

295
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:28,066
These tentacles assure my victory over everyone!

296
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:29,416
Everyone!

297
00:16:37,711 --> 00:16:39,625
Pardon us, Koro-sensei.

298
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:43,972
My hot-headed ward isn't exactly prime
classroom material at the best of times.

299
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:46,601
It's not lost on me that this is his first day,

300
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:49,532
but a mandatory vacation is clearly in order.

301
00:16:49,847 --> 00:16:50,972
Excuse me!

302
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:52,431
I can't let you walk out of here with him.

303
00:16:52,514 --> 00:16:53,681
He's my student!

304
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:56,793
Until graduation, his well-being falls on me.

305
00:16:56,989 --> 00:16:59,614
And, frankly, I also have a lot of questions

306
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,735
to ask you, Mr. Shiro.

307
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:03,698
Sorry. We're leaving.

308
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:06,001
Unless you care to use force?

309
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:10,014
Anti-Sensei fibers.

310
00:17:10,277 --> 00:17:12,676
I have no intention of being restrained by you.

311
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,531
No to worry, my conscientious friend.

312
00:17:15,596 --> 00:17:17,052
He'll be back before you know it.

313
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:19,229
March is almost upon us after all.

314
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,188
In the meantime, I'll take responsibility

315
00:17:22,264 --> 00:17:23,981
for his well-being, thank you.

316
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,689
Such a personality.

317
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,866
It will hoist him by his own petard before doomsday.

318
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:37,194
And those children.

319
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:40,052
Huh! Very promising.

320
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:42,946
What an unpredictable classroom.

321
00:17:43,347 --> 00:17:45,249
Like this weather we're having today.

322
00:17:48,722 --> 00:17:50,889
Ugh, I'm so dreadfully embarrassed.

323
00:17:50,972 --> 00:17:52,764
What's with him all of a sudden?

324
00:17:52,847 --> 00:17:55,056
He's been this way for a while.

325
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:56,389
A grim turn of events

326
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:58,306
has brought out my serious side and I'm ashamed!

327
00:17:58,364 --> 00:18:01,114
You children are supposed to think of me as comic relief!

328
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:01,743
We are?

329
00:18:01,991 --> 00:18:04,143
But you got so serious about it.

330
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:06,264
"Tell me where those tentacles came from?

331
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:07,884
Why does someone like you have them?"

332
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:09,472
Don't repeat that!

333
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:12,612
Just hearing those words again make
me want to bury my head in the sand!

334
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:16,431
I'm a free-spirited, impish type
who cleverly dodges direct questions!

335
00:18:16,514 --> 00:18:17,530
That's my shtick!

336
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,073
I was forced to break character!

337
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,806
You dissecting your character type is what's humiliating.

338
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:23,227
What a day, huh?

339
00:18:23,472 --> 00:18:26,906
Was anyone else caught off guard by the
tentacles growing out of that boy's head?

340
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:28,749
Level with us, sir.

341
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:29,567
What's up?

342
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:31,681
Yeah, how are you connected to those guys?

343
00:18:31,764 --> 00:18:33,972
No side-stepping the issue like you normally do!

344
00:18:34,056 --> 00:18:35,531
We all have a right to know.

345
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:37,639
You don't want our imaginations running wild.

346
00:18:37,729 --> 00:18:39,472
Exactly. Come on.

347
00:18:39,556 --> 00:18:40,847
We're your students.

348
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,736
If you can't open up to us, what're we here for?

349
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,798
No, you're right.

350
00:18:46,186 --> 00:18:48,721
It's high time I told you children the truth.

351
00:18:50,152 --> 00:18:52,884
In reality, your teacher...

352
00:18:53,514 --> 00:18:56,181
Is a biologically engineered life form!

353
00:18:58,245 --> 00:18:59,204
Um, yeah.

354
00:18:59,272 --> 00:18:59,757
Duh.

355
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:01,759
That's all I get?

356
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,485
Pardon me if I expected a bit more of a reaction!

357
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:06,614
Sir, we kinda noticed that you're an octopus

358
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:08,389
that flies through the air at Mach Twenty.

359
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:11,806
But you said you're not from another
planet, so that rules out alien.

360
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,255
And how else can you and Itona be brothers when you had

361
00:19:14,347 --> 00:19:17,045
different parents unless you were biologically engineered.

362
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,117
Oh, my!

363
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:20,240
You boys and girls are incredibly sharp!

364
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:22,139
Sir, focus on what happened today.

365
00:19:22,352 --> 00:19:25,097
Why were you mad? His tentacles upset you.

366
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:26,665
We've never seen you like that.

367
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:29,097
Does it have something to do

368
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:31,020
with why you were created in the first place?

369
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:33,029
I mean, why are you even here?

370
00:19:35,222 --> 00:19:37,181
All very good questions.

371
00:19:37,264 --> 00:19:39,202
Too bad they won't matter.

372
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,470
Soon, everything you want to know will be reduced

373
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,266
to space dust swirling in the
place where Earth used to be.

374
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,972
On the other hand, if you're serious

375
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,431
about saving this planet, you'll have amble opportunity

376
00:19:52,514 --> 00:19:54,268
to learn the truth between now and then.

377
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:56,347
They say curiosity killed the cat,

378
00:19:56,422 --> 00:19:58,854
but if those enquiring minds are to be satisfied,

379
00:19:58,918 --> 00:20:00,940
you'll have to continue trying to kill me.

380
00:20:01,197 --> 00:20:03,572
Teacher, student. Assassin, target.

381
00:20:03,597 --> 00:20:06,732
Those are the ties that bind us
to one another in this classroom.

382
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:09,254
Nothing comes from nothing, boys and girls.

383
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:11,264
If you want answers, work for them.

384
00:20:11,362 --> 00:20:12,857
Show me what you've learned.

385
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:18,020
If we're done, giving yours truly the third degree.

386
00:20:18,405 --> 00:20:20,302
Class dismissed.

387
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:23,358
I'm so embarrassed.

388
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:26,745
We're assassins.

389
00:20:27,073 --> 00:20:29,336
We find answers on the edge of a blade.

390
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:31,637
Our target is our teacher.

391
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:32,014
Unbelievable...

392
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,681
Our question is his life.

393
00:20:33,706 --> 00:20:34,889
This is beyond mortifying.

394
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:37,222
I could just crawl into a hole and die.

395
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:39,610
Right. No student was hurt in any way.

396
00:20:40,014 --> 00:20:41,650
Make arrangements for repairs.

397
00:20:41,856 --> 00:20:42,993
Mr. Karasuma?

398
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:46,403
What can I do for you? Or, rather, for all of you.

399
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,914
Um... can you teach us more about assassination?

400
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:51,828
We wanna sharpen our skills.

401
00:20:52,014 --> 00:20:52,582
Hmm.

402
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:54,807
You already know plenty.

403
00:20:55,173 --> 00:20:57,214
Here's the deal, sir. We've been slacking off

404
00:20:57,239 --> 00:21:00,597
'cause we figured someone else would
take care of killing Koro-sensei, y'know?

405
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:03,228
Yeah, 'cept when we saw Itona do his thing,

406
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:04,166
it dawned on us.

407
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,194
The thing is, we don't want it to be someone else.

408
00:21:07,931 --> 00:21:10,722
It should be us. If they can just bring anyone they want

409
00:21:10,782 --> 00:21:12,323
to do it, well, what's the point

410
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,766
of us being here in the first place, right?

411
00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:16,942
We may not have a lot of time left,

412
00:21:17,222 --> 00:21:19,278
but we're willing to work harder. Please.

413
00:21:19,514 --> 00:21:21,359
We want to assassinate our teacher!

414
00:21:21,495 --> 00:21:24,854
Like he said, we have to work for any answers ourselves.

415
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:28,040
What a positive shift in attitude.

416
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:29,550
Nice.

417
00:21:30,764 --> 00:21:31,624
All right, then.

418
00:21:31,806 --> 00:21:35,681
Students interested in beefing up their
assassination skills can stay after class.

419
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:37,014
Be ready to work hard!

420
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,170
Yes, sir!

421
00:21:38,722 --> 00:21:40,472
Let's start by climbing up this rope.

422
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:42,478
It's brand new and waiting to be broken in.

423
00:21:42,514 --> 00:21:43,668
Seriously?!

424
00:21:43,847 --> 00:21:44,681
Come on...

425
00:21:44,716 --> 00:21:46,225
Kunugigaoka Junior High.

426
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:47,597
Class Three-E.

427
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,517
Our Assassination Classroom.

428
00:21:49,894 --> 00:21:50,978
The rain lets up.

429
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:52,098
The bell rings.

430
00:21:52,222 --> 00:21:53,798
Another day ends.
