1
00:00:01,619 --> 00:00:03,160
"First, you take the planet Earth,"

2
00:00:03,244 --> 00:00:04,660
"round and blue and green."

3
00:00:04,744 --> 00:00:07,994
"And floating over Tokyo, you drop a giant bean."

4
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:11,327
"Put another one in Sichuan, China... what a sheen!"

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,369
"Taking off from Dubai to Hawaii at Mach Twenty,"

6
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:16,077
"leave contrails as you fly."

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,344
"Double back across the Southern Hemisphere"

8
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:20,632
"over the Philippines once again to ol' Dubai."

9
00:00:20,657 --> 00:00:23,077
"And then! Back to Hawaii, drawing lines of latitude"

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,785
"every 25 degrees along the way."

11
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:28,179
"And there you have it:"

12
00:00:28,744 --> 00:00:31,202
"Koro-sensei!"

13
00:00:31,285 --> 00:00:33,660
See? Simple! Now you try it!

14
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:34,869
Are you kidding?!

15
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:13,086
Here's the hitch,

16
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:17,574
your target is a junior high school teacher
chaperoning students on a field trip to Kyoto.

17
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,235
As you're probably aware, he's not human.

18
00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:24,952
Now, I don't mean to call your skills into question,

19
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:28,174
but on this assignment, be ready for anything.

20
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:31,015
They call me Red Eye.

21
00:02:31,494 --> 00:02:33,799
I'm a hired gun. A sharpshooter.

22
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:41,915
Wowza!

23
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:45,221
The open-air design really lets you feel this baby move!

24
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:47,600
This is how you travel by train!

25
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,702
Zipped along at a bracing 25 kilometers per hour,

26
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:52,203
and no queasiness!

27
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:54,460
Says the guy who can break the sound barrier.

28
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,041
Just a little more.

29
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:01,412
And we'll be right in the sniper's line of sight.

30
00:03:02,327 --> 00:03:03,263
Incidentally.

31
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:06,581
It's a popular tourist stop on the Sagano Tram line.

32
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,707
The Hozu River Bridge.

33
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:11,427
All right, folks.

34
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:13,997
Now's the time to snap those pictures.

35
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:17,595
Hey! Check out the boat, Koro-sensei!

36
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:19,249
Coolest thing ever, huh?

37
00:03:19,274 --> 00:03:20,401
Ooh, let me see!

38
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:21,639
Nice!

39
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,364
He's waiting on the banks.

40
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:27,910
Our high sign is when Koro-sensei leans forward

41
00:03:27,994 --> 00:03:29,480
to get a better look at the boat.

42
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,391
One time, in the Middle East,

43
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:36,958
I shot a man at twenty clicks during a sandstorm.

44
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:40,256
Beautiful day, clear line of sight.

45
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:43,194
Easy mode. Yeah.

46
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:46,079
If that wasn't a headshot, I'm a monkey's...

47
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:49,732
He blocked my bullet with a piece of yatsuhashi?

48
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:50,978
Oh dear.

49
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:53,725
There seems to be a sliver of bone in my om-nom.

50
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:55,410
That could've turned out ugly.

51
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:57,130
Urgh! Impossible!

52
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:59,229
A high-spin round stopped dead

53
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:02,041
by a tiny piece of local, ooey-gooey goodness?!

54
00:04:03,504 --> 00:04:05,464
How fast do they expect me to be?

55
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:08,872
Hmph. Okay.

56
00:04:09,156 --> 00:04:11,415
Now I understand the price on this guy's head.

57
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:15,522
Mr. K was serious we he said my target wasn't human.

58
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:18,507
This is gonna be fun.

59
00:04:20,655 --> 00:04:22,908
Be gone with thee, foul wastrel!

60
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:26,070
Your presence doth desecrate mine eye!

61
00:04:27,574 --> 00:04:29,439
How dare you address me thus?!

62
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,764
Let us teach this man humility, brothers!

63
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:36,608
Awesome!

64
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,286
Their swords move so fast you can barely see them!

65
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,850
These men are highly trained in
the subtle art of stage combat.

66
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:46,873
Did I mention that I'm an aficionado of Edo-era swordplay?

67
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:48,782
Whoa!

68
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:49,957
Heads up!

69
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:52,131
Watch out, sir! Don't stand so close!

70
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:53,128
Okie dokie.

71
00:04:55,876 --> 00:04:58,069
The actors are guiding the target nicely.

72
00:04:58,369 --> 00:05:01,611
Good. Everything's going according to plan.

73
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:04,622
That's right, eyes on the show.

74
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:06,337
Huh?

75
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:08,531
Where the hell?!

76
00:05:10,113 --> 00:05:11,692
Oh, come on! Really?!

77
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,630
How's everyone okay with this?

78
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:16,491
I come to thine aid.

79
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,244
Blood-soaked sakura blossoms are an evil flower.

80
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:20,827
I will not abide them.

81
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,456
He even knows the lines?!

82
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:26,455
I can't hit him like this! The actors are in the way!

83
00:05:26,696 --> 00:05:28,279
Gah, I hate actors!

84
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:30,845
He's been clocked at Mach Twenty,

85
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:33,593
and his defensive techniques are unconventional.

86
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:35,285
But don't let that throw you off.

87
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:39,107
Yeah. Unconventional. Moving on!

88
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,138
This son of a bitch is dead.

89
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:43,912
I stake my name on it.

90
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:46,535
You're late, sir. What took you so long?

91
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:47,827
So sorry!

92
00:05:47,886 --> 00:05:50,077
I got swept up into a samurai drama.

93
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,177
I was the star!

94
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:52,459
I totally believe it.

95
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:55,247
Y'know, we finished Kiyomizu Temple like forever ago.

96
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,349
Then what do you say we scope
out Ninehnzaka Street for souvenirs?

97
00:05:58,452 --> 00:06:00,864
Yeah, right. Like you'll buy anything except junk food.

98
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:02,986
Okay.

99
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:08,047
Perfect place to draw a steady bead on him.

100
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:11,749
From Yasaka's five-story pagoda, it's a straight shot.

101
00:06:11,928 --> 00:06:14,344
Here, Koro-sensei, try this blotting paper!

102
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:15,380
It's super cool.

103
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,619
I'm not sure I care for you to see what it'll pick up.

104
00:06:18,821 --> 00:06:20,202
C'mon, it's supposed to be fun!

105
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:21,406
Okay, guess we're doing this.

106
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:24,297
He pores over his tchotchkes at the foot of Sannenzaka.

107
00:06:24,994 --> 00:06:26,815
And while a student distracts him...

108
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,437
Booyah! Smack dab in the temple!

109
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:35,647
This is ridiculous! A piece of paper?!

110
00:06:35,672 --> 00:06:37,802
See? This is exactly what I meant.

111
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:39,385
Look at all these secretions.

112
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,718
There's enough mucus here to stop a bullet.

113
00:06:42,631 --> 00:06:43,052
Hmm?

114
00:06:44,682 --> 00:06:48,056
Ah. Nagisa's group is calling. Excuse me. Hello?

115
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:50,505
Tell me where you are.

116
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,684
Damn. What in god's name is this thing?

117
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,021
His speed's insane, his defenses impregnable.

118
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:03,604
It's like he's factory-made with the
express purpose of being un-friggin'-killable.

119
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:09,031
Red Eye here.

120
00:07:09,202 --> 00:07:09,744
It's me.

121
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:10,978
Oh, hey Mr. K.

122
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:13,458
I'm afraid you'll have to pack it in for today.

123
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,625
No more attempts.

124
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:18,899
The next group you were supposed to work
with has run into some unforeseen issues.

125
00:07:18,924 --> 00:07:21,029
Something about a gang of high school thugs.

126
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:24,269
Target is disregarding the itinerary to go to their aid.

127
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:26,312
Yes, sir. Understood.

128
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:28,952
To be honest...

129
00:07:29,702 --> 00:07:32,349
this bastard makes we wanna throw in the towel anyway.

130
00:07:36,242 --> 00:07:38,697
I've been a sniper for eight years.

131
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:42,876
And not once have I failed to
see a mark's blood in my scope.

132
00:07:43,304 --> 00:07:46,411
Not once. That's how I got the name Red Eye.

133
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:49,670
Kinda strange when you think about it.

134
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,377
Nothing particularly red about my eye.

135
00:07:54,136 --> 00:07:55,014
Here you go.

136
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:58,204
It's a special blend of spices from Sannenzaka.

137
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:01,316
Thank you. 'Preciate it. You really shouldn't have...

138
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:04,167
What in the hell?!

139
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:06,619
Sorry to disrupt your plans;

140
00:08:06,644 --> 00:08:08,546
some of my students were in a pickle.

141
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:10,535
Not to worry, it's taken care of.

142
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,279
Everything's shipshape now.

143
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:16,804
So I thought I'd take this
opportunity to drop by and say hello.

144
00:08:23,506 --> 00:08:26,879
So you knew the plan and you
were just playing along for kicks?

145
00:08:27,462 --> 00:08:29,540
You're one scary customer, you know that?

146
00:08:30,402 --> 00:08:33,124
No wonder the government's
paying a fortune to keep you secret.

147
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:36,165
So, uh... Let's cut to the chase, huh?

148
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,818
If you're gonna kill me, go right ahead.

149
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:43,059
Death's an occupational hazard.
I know what I signed up for.

150
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:47,784
Just eat it!

151
00:08:50,184 --> 00:08:52,035
You don't really think I'm going to kill you?

152
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:54,981
When you've gone to so much
trouble making this an enjoyable trip?

153
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,421
On the contrary, I'm here to thank you.

154
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:03,535
My students did some very impressive research
on this region. Yes, as a means of pinpointing

155
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:05,827
an ideal spot for assassination, but still!

156
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:11,190
They steeped themselves in geography, local
customs, tourist highlights, history, all of it.

157
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:15,744
As a matter of fact, their efforts brought
them closer to this city's charms than a teacher

158
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:17,431
might otherwise dare to hope.

159
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:23,124
They've really come to understand another place
and its people; to expand their minds with travel.

160
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,494
What ultimately brought them
to that milestone? Assassination.

161
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,271
Here you go.

162
00:09:28,463 --> 00:09:32,554
Under the circumstances, I'm as
proud as punch to be their target.

163
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:35,358
I'll be damned. You're as crazy as you look.

164
00:09:36,263 --> 00:09:39,531
Still. I can tell you care about those kids.

165
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:43,670
Wish I'd had a teacher like you back in the day.

166
00:09:46,472 --> 00:09:48,222
Wait, what do you mean you're quitting?

167
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:49,890
Yeah, sorry.

168
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:53,051
I suddenly feel like just being a tourist for a while.

169
00:09:54,712 --> 00:09:57,826
Life tends to pass you by in the sniper's nest, ya know?

170
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,774
It's time I expanded the ol' color palate.

171
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,673
Eye's gettin' tired of red.

172
00:10:07,267 --> 00:10:08,339
Now, let me see.

173
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:11,603
What hue should I set my sights on tomorrow?

174
00:10:20,742 --> 00:10:21,566
Hot damn!

175
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:23,602
How the hell are you dodging all of those?!

176
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:26,586
This is actually starting to get embarrassing.

177
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:29,875
Look at the way she handles that
joystick, smiling like it's no big deal.

178
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,880
Oh, wow! I had no idea.

179
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:34,677
I mean, who knew you'd turn
out to be such a video game pro?

180
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:37,327
I've kept it secret. My family's super strict.

181
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,518
They don't approve of me wasting time on stuff like this.

182
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:43,090
Lately, though, I feel like I'm over
caring so much about what they think.

183
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:45,441
Well what anybody thinks, really.

184
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:48,580
I used to get so stressed about how other people saw me.

185
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:50,704
I always second-guessed myself.

186
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:54,435
But then Koro-sensei made me realize.

187
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:57,111
It's all about doing the best with what you have.

188
00:10:57,345 --> 00:10:59,591
Being true to the person you are on the inside.

189
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:03,962
Not a side of Kanzaki I expected to see.

190
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,197
I wonder what she and Kayano talked about
while those creeps held them against their will.

191
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:11,510
It's like, I dunno, like they've bonded.

192
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:12,244
They blew you up!

193
00:11:12,268 --> 00:11:12,866
Yeah, that'll happen.

194
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,472
A-ha!

195
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:16,267
Hey, good save, man.

196
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:20,347
Almost every sniper who saw the
specs on this mission turned it down.

197
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:25,479
The one guy we thought was a shoe-in
quit halfway through the assignment. Damn.

198
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,175
So much for our Kyoto gambit, I suppose.

199
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,244
Who else wants some?!

200
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:31,890
Hey, Mr. Karasuma, quick game?

201
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:33,564
Aw, what the hell.

202
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:35,776
No more horning in on their field trip.

203
00:11:36,184 --> 00:11:38,508
This is supposed to be their time, after all.

204
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:41,915
You got it, but I'll warn you.

205
00:11:41,963 --> 00:11:42,798
I'm pretty good.

206
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:46,180
I'm just gonna say it. This place is a dump.

207
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:50,231
Why we gotta sleep in two big
dorm rooms separated by gender?

208
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:53,965
The kids in all the other classes
get put up in their own fancy suites.

209
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,536
Personally, I think it's more fun this... way...

210
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,703
Hey. What are you guys doing?

211
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:01,474
Shh!

212
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,293
What does it look like we're doing?

213
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:04,469
Tryin' to sneak a peek!

214
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:05,073
What?!

215
00:12:05,547 --> 00:12:07,209
Wait, that supposed to be our job!

216
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:08,587
It's nobody's job.

217
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,787
Either way, who can resist?

218
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:13,725
Look at the way that outfit is hung.

219
00:12:13,955 --> 00:12:15,768
That can only mean one thing.

220
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,318
You're a clever guy. You get what I'm saying.

221
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:23,321
We wanna see what he looks like naked.

222
00:12:23,346 --> 00:12:24,990
This may be our only opportunity.

223
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:28,495
Does he have a proper body or
is it tentacles all the way down?

224
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,347
And it's not creepy 'cause we need
all the Intel on Koro-sensei we can get.

225
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:34,870
Can we all agree that this isn't the least bit sexy?

226
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,562
Is he a chick?!

227
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,975
Oh, hello, children.

228
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:43,916
Are you taking a bubble bath in a public restroom?

229
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:46,354
We're not s'posed to add anything to the water, sir.

230
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:48,537
Worry not. This is just my mucus.

231
00:12:48,562 --> 00:12:49,134
Huh?

232
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:52,951
On contact with water, it works up a
nice lather and acts as an exfoliate.

233
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,060
So is that a pro or a con?

234
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:57,475
Yeah. Fascinating.

235
00:12:57,662 --> 00:12:59,269
But you let your guard down, sir,

236
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:01,056
and we're blocking your exit.

237
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,447
You'll come slopping out of that tub eventually.

238
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:06,084
And when you do, you'll have to walk by us.

239
00:13:06,237 --> 00:13:08,237
We may not kill you, but we'll see you naked!

240
00:13:08,305 --> 00:13:09,803
This simply will not do!

241
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:10,724
A-ha!

242
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:11,875
What the hell is that?!

243
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,413
Jellied broth, my dear! Now, if you'll excuse me.

244
00:13:17,654 --> 00:13:18,571
All righty, then.

245
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:19,813
Well, that was lame.

246
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:21,952
Can we peep on a woman next time, please?

247
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:24,845
Travel sure brings out another side of people.

248
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:26,505
I know I'm learning a lot.

249
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:30,121
Sucks we still don't know what Koro-sensei
looks like under his clothes, though.

250
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:31,724
Can we go back to the room now?

251
00:13:34,874 --> 00:13:36,402
Kanzaki's in the top spot.

252
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:37,489
No surprise there.

253
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:39,675
Well, yeah. Everybody likes her.

254
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:40,635
I know.

255
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:42,997
Pretty slick of you to pull her into our group, Sugino.

256
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:47,064
I was hoping me an' her would have a
chance to talk a little on this trip?

257
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:49,668
But with all the crap that went down, no dice.

258
00:13:49,702 --> 00:13:50,766
Sucks to be you, man.

259
00:13:50,876 --> 00:13:52,242
Better luck next time, I guess.

260
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:53,694
Dudes, you're killin' me!

261
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,684
Can we just focus on who has the hots for who?

262
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,709
Don't ask me to choose!

263
00:13:56,789 --> 00:13:58,346
I can't do it! No! No!

264
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,671
You're exempted.

265
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:01,022
What about you?

266
00:14:01,163 --> 00:14:02,959
Which of the class shorties is your top pick?

267
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:05,035
Huh? Uh... I don't really know.

268
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,933
Ah, c'mon, Maehara. You gonna ask you gotta tell.

269
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:09,395
Sorry. No can do.

270
00:14:09,494 --> 00:14:11,119
A gentleman keeps his secrets, fellas.

271
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:12,130
Bitch move, man!

272
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:15,594
When I think how popular dillweeds
like you are, it drives me crazy!

273
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:17,389
Sounds like a party in here.

274
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:19,502
Karma! Great timing!

275
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:21,869
Which of the girls in our class do you like?

276
00:14:22,438 --> 00:14:23,355
Hmm...

277
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:25,651
I believe I'll have to go with Okuda.

278
00:14:25,784 --> 00:14:27,076
Dude, you're kidding. Really?

279
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,458
Huh. Interesting. But why Okuda?

280
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:31,110
She's a demon with chemistry.

281
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:33,208
Think of all the concoctions she could brew up

282
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:36,855
to enhance my shenanigans. It'd be a match made in heaven.

283
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:39,199
Yeah, heaven. Sure.

284
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:43,043
Hey, guys. We're agreeing to keep
these ratings just between us, yeah?

285
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:44,568
Of course. We're not stupid.

286
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:47,429
So absolutely none of what we're saying leaves this room?

287
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:51,046
If this information got out, we'd have a real problem.

288
00:14:51,086 --> 00:14:53,712
Don't mind me. Just passing by.

289
00:14:58,692 --> 00:14:59,889
Oh, no he di'n't!

290
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:01,022
Kill him!

291
00:15:03,422 --> 00:15:07,881
If I can't get the low-down on juicy
gossip like this, what's Mach Twenty good for?!

292
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:11,805
Ew. Who wants to talk about boys?

293
00:15:11,888 --> 00:15:14,885
Ugh, c'mon. That's what girls
talk about on trips like these.

294
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,808
Don't be a party pooper.

295
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,708
I'll start! I have a huge crush on Mr. Karasuma!

296
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:21,482
Honey, there's no one here that
doesn't have a thing for that man.

297
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,486
I'm talking about boys in our
class that we think are hotties.

298
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:25,511
Aww...

299
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:27,302
Whatever, I'll get the ball rolling.

300
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,625
Isogai and Maehara are half decent, I guess.

301
00:15:29,758 --> 00:15:31,510
Gross. You don't seriously like them?

302
00:15:31,535 --> 00:15:35,798
Why not? Maehara plays the field, though, so
I'd never actually go out with him or anything.

303
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,851
Isogai's class monitor, so he's, like, upwardly mobile.

304
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:41,416
I don't know. Karma's the
cutest of the bunch if you ask me.

305
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,719
Too bad he's such a psycho.

306
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:44,704
True...

307
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,070
Come on.

308
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,335
I don't think he's that bad when you get to know him.

309
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,135
Hey, 'least he's quiet most of the time.

310
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,535
Yeah, so are wild animals.

311
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,728
Who'd you pick, Kanzaki?

312
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:55,594
Uh... I don't really think about it. No idea, sorry.

313
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:57,328
Oh, please! Liar!

314
00:15:57,796 --> 00:15:59,084
Don't be a prude! Spill it!

315
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:00,085
You know you have your choice!

316
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,543
They all worship you!

317
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:02,587
Tell us!

318
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:03,737
Seriously, you guys!

319
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:04,690
Knock it off!

320
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:06,860
Okay, girls. Settle down.

321
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:11,188
I'm supposed to tell you lights out,
so, I dunno, at least pretend to be asleep?

322
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:12,697
Wow, way to chaperone there.

323
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,723
We all know you're gonna stay up jibber-jabbing.

324
00:16:14,748 --> 00:16:17,663
Just keep the antics to a dull roar, okay?

325
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:20,358
Hang on, how come you get to drink beer? Meanie!

326
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:23,385
I'm an adult, sweetie. Adults get to drink beer.

327
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,785
Why don't you stay up with us?

328
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,713
You could tell us some "adult" stories!

329
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:27,593
Huh?

330
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:30,226
We'd probably get more out of 'em than your usual classes.

331
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:31,692
Why, you trashy li'l ginger...

332
00:16:31,716 --> 00:16:32,355
Now, now.

333
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,619
Don't get bent out of shape.

334
00:16:34,187 --> 00:16:35,428
Huhh?!

335
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:37,120
No way! You're only twenty?!

336
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:40,662
You look great, it's just, you're so... "experienced".

337
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:41,645
I know, right?

338
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:43,535
And the whole black widow vibe.

339
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:44,539
Ladies.

340
00:16:44,564 --> 00:16:47,094
I wouldn't have gotten far in
this line of work if I wasn't...

341
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,869
Who the hell just called me a black widow?!

342
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:50,332
Delayed reaction much?

343
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:53,089
Whatever. Point is, if I teach you nothing else.

344
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:56,974
You should know sex appeal is skin deep

345
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,673
and by the time you get it, it fades.

346
00:16:59,005 --> 00:17:02,099
In a place like the one I was born
in, you learn that all too quickly.

347
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:06,719
Professor Bitch actually said
something profound for a change.

348
00:17:06,744 --> 00:17:07,732
Feels like B.S.

349
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:09,113
I heard that, you hussy!

350
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,205
Oh, just ignore her.

351
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:14,191
Tell us about all the rich men you seduced and killed!

352
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,625
That's what we're dying to hear!

353
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:16,916
Yeah! I totally second that!

354
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:19,274
Hmph. Well, if you insist.

355
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:22,970
Be warned, my life story might
be a bit spicy for girls like you.

356
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:25,876
It all began at the tender age of seventeen.

357
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:27,943
I don't think so, pal!

358
00:17:28,304 --> 00:17:30,760
You got a lot of balls helping yourself to our girl-talk!

359
00:17:30,785 --> 00:17:33,744
Aw! But I wanna hear your stories, too!

360
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:36,341
Why can't an impartial observer get in on this action?

361
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:38,702
Ha! You never tell us about your love life!

362
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:41,369
You wanna sit there and listen,
fine, but give us the goods!

363
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,723
She's right. It's only fair, you know.

364
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:46,376
We know you've got a romance in there somewhere!

365
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:48,117
You like giant boobs!

366
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,688
You must at least have a crush on somebody!

367
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:55,822
Oh no, he didn't!

368
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:57,943
Catch him, make him sing, and cut his throat!

369
00:17:57,968 --> 00:17:58,579
There he is!

370
00:17:58,928 --> 00:17:59,661
Come on!

371
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:04,100
Rats! Caught in a pincer attack!

372
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:07,255
You guys still trying to kill him?

373
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,599
Assassination doesn't have a curfew, huh?

374
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:16,352
Hm?

375
00:18:16,786 --> 00:18:18,831
That was a little too close for comfort!

376
00:18:19,035 --> 00:18:21,096
Would you mind telling me what all that racket was about?

377
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:22,065
Nothing.

378
00:18:22,138 --> 00:18:24,672
The students wanted me to open up about my love life.

379
00:18:24,745 --> 00:18:25,632
Your what?

380
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:27,350
Oh, I assure you,

381
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,496
my past is positively riddled with romantic encounters.

382
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:33,204
I haven't enough fingers and
toes to keep count of them all.

383
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:36,231
Fingers and toes, huh?

384
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:38,229
I assume you're referring back to a time

385
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:39,584
when you had hands and feet?

386
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:47,060
Sorry. I didn't mean to go there.

387
00:18:47,785 --> 00:18:50,202
I wouldn't want to talk about the past in your shoes.

388
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:52,509
A wise observation, Mr. Karasuma.

389
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:57,015
It's bad manners to ask after
the number of one's appendages.

390
00:18:57,508 --> 00:18:59,083
Even while traveling together.

391
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:03,545
This has been such a great trip, right?

392
00:19:03,994 --> 00:19:06,213
It's like we've all really gotten to know each other.

393
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:07,659
That's true.

394
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:09,933
Hm? Is something the matter?

395
00:19:11,187 --> 00:19:12,497
I was just thinking.

396
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:15,097
You know how our trip's mostly over?

397
00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:17,005
Even though it feels like we just got here?

398
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,976
I'm kind of starting to feel the same way about life.

399
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:23,296
We're just learning about the
world, and it may be over soon.

400
00:19:23,922 --> 00:19:24,718
Yeah...

401
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,427
And even if the world isn't over by March,

402
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:29,247
this class will be.

403
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:31,383
Right...

404
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:35,704
I wanna live big, to experience everything,

405
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,596
to be a top-notch assassin.

406
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:40,156
I just want my life to have purpose, you know?

407
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:44,080
Hm. I hear you.

408
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,543
For now, I'd settle for just
one more school trip like this one.

409
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:48,728
Me, too.

410
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:53,448
Tonight, the curtain falls on our adventures in Kyoto.

411
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:54,902
What a trip.

412
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:59,366
Tomorrow, it's back to life at Kunugigaoka Junior High.

413
00:19:59,993 --> 00:20:02,131
Back to our Assassination Classroom.

414
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:40,379
So, no luck neutralizing him on the
field trip to Kyoto either, I take it?

415
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:43,397
This is most unfortunate, Mr. Karasuma.

416
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,963
The fault lies entirely with me, sir.

417
00:21:46,245 --> 00:21:47,932
I will redouble my efforts.

418
00:21:48,158 --> 00:21:50,075
Need I remind you that May is almost over?

419
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:51,899
Our deadline is fast approaching.

420
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:53,427
It will be here before we know it.

421
00:21:53,452 --> 00:21:54,064
Precisely.

422
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:56,116
Why not just fire a missile at the school

423
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:57,710
and flatten the whole confounded thing?

424
00:21:57,735 --> 00:21:58,869
We've been through this.

425
00:21:58,894 --> 00:22:00,422
Far too much collateral damage.

426
00:22:00,747 --> 00:22:03,164
And there'd be no guarantee he wouldn't escape the blast.

427
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:06,485
You recall what became of our trying
to hit him over the Pacific, don't you?

428
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,385
He reassembled the missile fragments and handed them back.

429
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,411
Hey, nice try!

430
00:22:11,923 --> 00:22:13,006
So what are you saying?

431
00:22:13,105 --> 00:22:14,813
That there's no surefire way to kill him?

432
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:16,081
Worry not, gentlemen.

433
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,243
Several allied nations have pooled
their resources to arrive at a solution.

434
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,439
The fruits of their labor are most interesting.

435
00:22:23,947 --> 00:22:27,362
In fact, we've already received
consent from the Ministry of Defense.

436
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:32,456
Joining the so-called Assassination
Classroom will be two very special additions.

437
00:22:33,493 --> 00:22:37,740
Cutting-edge science has vested both
with veritably superhuman abilities.

438
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,697
One still has a few kinks that need to be worked out.

439
00:22:42,132 --> 00:22:45,000
The other was put on standby while you were in Kyoto.

440
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:47,136
Oh, yes, Mr. Karasuma.

441
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,696
There is quite a surprise waiting for you back at school.
