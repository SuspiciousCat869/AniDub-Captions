1
00:00:05,396 --> 00:00:06,507
Okey-dokey.

2
00:00:06,848 --> 00:00:09,829
What fiendish assassination ploy did you have in mind?

3
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:12,239
First off we'd like you to enjoy this little video

4
00:00:12,264 --> 00:00:13,411
Mimura put together.

5
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:16,740
Then the high rollers'll cash in on those seven tentacles.

6
00:00:17,348 --> 00:00:20,617
When you're incapacitated, that'll be
the signal for everyone else to join.

7
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:22,348
What'cha think, Koro-Sensei?

8
00:00:22,431 --> 00:00:23,044
Work for you?

9
00:00:24,737 --> 00:00:26,123
Splendidly.

10
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:28,781
We appreciate you bustin' your butt on this.

11
00:00:28,806 --> 00:00:29,747
Aw, thanks man.

12
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:31,430
It really came down to the wire there.

13
00:00:31,473 --> 00:00:33,410
I had to work on the final edit during dinner.

14
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:35,076
Hm.

15
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:38,098
A remote locale completely surrounded

16
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:41,223
by seawater. The walls and windows are more than likely

17
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:45,119
treated with an Anti-me agent.
Outright escape is too risky.

18
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:50,308
My best bet is to dodge their attacks within the premises.

19
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:51,315
Sir?

20
00:00:51,473 --> 00:00:51,968
Eh?

21
00:00:51,993 --> 00:00:54,008
Um. I'm, gonna have to pat you down.

22
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:59,904
Sorry about this, but we can't take a chance you
have a swimsuit. That'd sorta put a damper on our plan.

23
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:01,598
So cautious!

24
00:01:01,704 --> 00:01:03,909
Admirable, but you needn't worry.

25
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:06,736
He sure is cooperative.

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,264
Swimsuit or not, once things get going,

27
00:01:09,389 --> 00:01:11,638
Koro-Sensei can dodge us at every turn.

28
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:14,389
Still, with all of us here,

29
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:16,112
he'll have his work cut out for him.

30
00:02:52,096 --> 00:02:54,305
Well, children? Shall we begin?

31
00:02:54,806 --> 00:02:57,498
Don't hold back. Come at me with everything you've got!

32
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,119
Right. Whaddya say, guys? Let's get to it.

33
00:03:07,764 --> 00:03:09,336
AC.

34
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:12,498
Somewhere in Tokyo.

35
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:14,806
Kunugigaoka Junior High.

36
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:16,185
Class Three-E.

37
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:19,258
An average classroom, except for the teacher,

38
00:03:19,621 --> 00:03:21,897
who is, in fact, a target...

39
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:25,098
I can hear a few of them shifting
around in the dark behind me.

40
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:28,113
A ruse, no doubt, to conceal that some are leaving.

41
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:32,723
Alas, boys and girls, I can establish who's outside

42
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:35,389
by the relative distance of
their scent. From the direction

43
00:03:35,473 --> 00:03:37,598
of the shore wafts the unmistakable smell

44
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:40,550
of our top snipers, Hayami and Chiba.

45
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:44,181
This video is exceptionally slick.

46
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:46,487
You were editor and narrator, Mimura?

47
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:47,425
Well done!

48
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:50,618
Professional-grade camera work, compelling score.

49
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,025
The viewer is utterly sucked in...

50
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:54,964
Thanks for tuning in.

51
00:03:55,557 --> 00:03:57,432
Joining us tonight are two recon specialists

52
00:03:57,548 --> 00:04:00,198
with very intriguing intel. We'll hear what they

53
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:02,871
have to tell us after this
brief public service announcement.

54
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:06,514
When you're a confirmed porn addict,

55
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:08,660
bribery's no guarantee against a scandal.

56
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:11,672
I gave you popsicles!

57
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:16,431
Our subject's preferred guilty pleasure is
the middle-aged executive. The sheer size of his

58
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:19,223
"Cube Farm Cuties Quarterly" collection is mind-blowing.

59
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:21,348
Blast it, Okajima! What is this?

60
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:22,982
We had an understanding!

61
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:26,931
At a recent women-only cake buffet,
a questionable attendee loomed.

62
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:29,906
Eye-witness reports suggest, you guessed it.

63
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:31,223
My name is Koroko!

64
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:32,929
Hardly a master of disguise.

65
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:36,329
We're still not sure how they exposed
him without realizing he isn't human.

66
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:40,014
Wow. I've got to hand it to you.

67
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:42,557
Ironically, it takes balls to
pull off an outfit like that.

68
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:46,446
Between paychecks, our porn addict defrauds

69
00:04:46,506 --> 00:04:48,667
the public to secure complimentary tissues.

70
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:49,994
What does he do with them?

71
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,773
The answer might surprise you.

72
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:53,035
He fries them.

73
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:54,816
That's right. Fries them.

74
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:58,574
As if this poor, wretched educator's
dignity weren't already suspect.

75
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:01,300
And that's not all.

76
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,906
To truly plumb the depths of this creature's

77
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:07,098
depravity, we've prepared a full hour of shocking footage.

78
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,398
There's a whole hour of this dreck?

79
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:14,389
No point in killing me, class.

80
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:15,951
I'm already dead.

81
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:17,311
Emotionally.

82
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:18,556
Intellectually.

83
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,639
Socially.

84
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:20,486
Dead.

85
00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:21,702
Brutal, right?

86
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:23,864
But you've got to admit, it held your attention.

87
00:05:24,238 --> 00:05:26,215
Notice anything strange while you were watching?

88
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:27,740
Like, about the venue?

89
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:31,689
What the...

90
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:34,874
I couldn't possibly have missed you flooding this place!

91
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:36,464
Unless...

92
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:38,482
high tide!

93
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:40,556
Weird.

94
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:43,463
It's like somebody trimmed down the support pylons.

95
00:05:43,598 --> 00:05:45,681
Seasick, shamed, and water-logged.

96
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:47,848
This just isn't shaping up to be your day.

97
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,978
Everything's conspired to slow you down.

98
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:57,677
Right! Time to party, Teach.

99
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:01,157
Now, you made a promise. So don't go backin' out.

100
00:06:01,764 --> 00:06:03,063
This is going to be tricky.

101
00:06:03,306 --> 00:06:05,597
But I know precisely where the snipers are.

102
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,029
I just have to keep an eye out in that direction.

103
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:11,939
Commence operation... now.

104
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:13,447
Let's go!

105
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:19,259
Time elapsed: five seconds.

106
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,246
Did it come apart?

107
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,112
Oh, hell yeah!

108
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:41,319
Time elapsed: 35 seconds.

109
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,975
Flyboards?

110
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,018
A hydraulic cage?

111
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:50,097
Yeah, that's right.

112
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:52,204
We know a quick change of environment throws you.

113
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,264
First you're in chapel, now you're in a cage!

114
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:55,764
If you're confused, good.

115
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,321
'Cause we'll take anything that slows your reaction time.

116
00:06:58,545 --> 00:06:59,964
Fifty-three seconds.

117
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:04,597
Commencing tactical volley in five...

118
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:08,426
four, three, two, one.

119
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:09,410
Fire!

120
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:11,612
Careful, guys.

121
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,532
Shoot around him. Keep him planted.

122
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,040
Everybody im to the left or right by about a meter!

123
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,431
Block his escape with a hail of bullets!

124
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:19,548
Wait for it.

125
00:07:22,014 --> 00:07:23,864
The kill-shot, goes to them.

126
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:27,312
The ones onshore are decoys infused with their scent.

127
00:07:28,503 --> 00:07:30,593
He was so focused on the shoreline,

128
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:32,738
he didn't see the hydro-cage coming.

129
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:35,669
This is how you snipe a Koro-Sensei!

130
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:37,560
And, that's game over!

131
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:42,955
Oh, my.

132
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:44,711
Well played.

133
00:08:12,931 --> 00:08:13,933
Nagisa!

134
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:21,203
This is totally different than our
other attempts. Feels like it worked!

135
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:23,098
Don't let your guard down!

136
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,178
It's still possible for him to regenerate!

137
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,693
Right! Isogai, you and Katakoa go.

138
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:28,931
Keep an eye out for the target!

139
00:08:29,014 --> 00:08:29,663
Yes, sir!

140
00:08:29,764 --> 00:08:30,465
We had him!

141
00:08:30,822 --> 00:08:32,411
There's nowhere he could've gone!

142
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:34,969
Hey, look over there!

143
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:35,422
Uh?

144
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:38,088
What is that?

145
00:08:38,112 --> 00:08:38,830
I dunno.

146
00:08:46,598 --> 00:08:47,050
Uh.

147
00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:54,879
Really?

148
00:08:56,905 --> 00:09:01,514
Allow me to introduce my trump card of
trump cards. My Absolute Defense Form!

149
00:09:01,598 --> 00:09:03,810
Absolute Defense Form?

150
00:09:04,056 --> 00:09:08,030
This exterior coating is comprised of
nano-matrices formed by surplus energy.

151
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:11,367
In essence, my body shrinks down to the size you see now,

152
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:15,221
and the compressed molecules create a
high density protective shell around me.

153
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,056
Why "Absolute"?

154
00:09:17,107 --> 00:09:19,240
Because it's absolutely invincible!

155
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,160
Uh...

156
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:25,574
So, basically you're saying as long as you're
like this, there's pretty much nothing we can do.

157
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:26,681
Don't fret, my dears.

158
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:27,995
It doesn't last long.

159
00:09:29,297 --> 00:09:31,764
The crystals comprising this shell tend to lose integrity

160
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:34,306
in about a day or so. Once the bonds break down,

161
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:36,931
the shell will expand back into its normal energy form,

162
00:09:37,014 --> 00:09:39,395
and yours truly will return to full size.

163
00:09:39,731 --> 00:09:41,803
This form is extraordinarily useful,

164
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:43,639
but the tradeoff is complete imobility

165
00:09:43,723 --> 00:09:46,363
for the duration. I can't propel myself an inch.

166
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,977
This itself carries its own risk.

167
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:50,662
Mom! Where did my thing go?

168
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,264
It was hideous. I threw it away.

169
00:09:52,348 --> 00:09:54,196
No!

170
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,922
For example, said immobility would provide anyone

171
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:01,434
so inclined the perfect opportunity for
launching me into space. Something I rather dread.

172
00:10:01,764 --> 00:10:03,973
I've done ample research into that, however.

173
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:08,974
Happily, nowhere on this planet is a rocket
capable of making that flight in 24 hours.

174
00:10:09,598 --> 00:10:10,428
He got us.

175
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:12,866
All that, and he got us again.

176
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:16,873
We exploited every single one of his weak points.

177
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:20,241
And still, nothing.

178
00:10:22,657 --> 00:10:23,727
That's crap!

179
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:26,914
Nothing is invincible if you whack it hard enough!

180
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:29,598
You're just wasting your time.

181
00:10:29,681 --> 00:10:31,806
A nuclear blast wouldn't leave so much as a scratch.

182
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:32,967
Oh, I see.

183
00:10:33,047 --> 00:10:33,374
Huh?

184
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,773
Well I guess that's it, we're out of options. Huh.

185
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,045
You monster!

186
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:42,261
I can't bury my face in my hands in this form!

187
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,250
Oh, sorry 'bout that. Let's
see if there's a way to help you

188
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:48,066
out there. This sea slug do anything?

189
00:10:50,005 --> 00:10:52,484
Anybody know where I can find a creepy old beach bum?

190
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:54,708
I'm gonna shove Koro-Sensei down his pants.

191
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,139
No, no, no! Someone help me, please!

192
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,283
I'd never take that form with a bunch of kids.

193
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,156
Yeah. Not exactly his smartest move.

194
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:02,389
Especially around Karma.

195
00:11:02,473 --> 00:11:04,598
All right, that's enough. Class dismissed.

196
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:06,598
For this one, we'll let HQ decide

197
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:07,706
the best course of action.

198
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:10,948
Your superiors will opt to toss me

199
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:14,387
in a pool of Anti-me liquid,
I'm sure. Good luck with that.

200
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,139
The energy displacement would explode, as it did earlier.

201
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:21,223
Everything in the vicinity will be
blown sky high, including your superiors.

202
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:21,682
Mm.

203
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:24,764
Still, you should be proud, boys and girls.

204
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:28,990
Entire armies the world over couldn't get
as close to killing me as you've done tonight.

205
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:32,954
This was, by far, the cleverest
assassination attempt I've ever encountered.

206
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:43,478
Sure, he praises our ingenuity like he always does.

207
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,523
But deep down, we know we blew it.

208
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:50,441
This was our best shot. How do we top this?

209
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:53,341
Never mind. I don't wanna even think about it right now.

210
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:54,556
I need sleep.

211
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:18,791
Ritsu.

212
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:20,902
Hi, Ryu.

213
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:22,459
You recorded it, right?

214
00:12:22,806 --> 00:12:27,014
As faithfully as possible, utilizing high-speed
camera filters whenever they seemed appropriate.

215
00:12:27,098 --> 00:12:27,932
Would you like to see?

216
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,788
The second I fired, part of
me knew the bullet wouldn't hit.

217
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:34,726
It was like... I knew he couldn't be killed.

218
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:40,811
I can only be approximate.
The time it took for Koro-Sensei

219
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:43,284
to adopt his Absolute Defense Form is unclear.

220
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:46,473
However, by my calculations, if your shot had been

221
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:49,514
point-five seconds faster, or Hayami's thirty centimeters

222
00:12:49,598 --> 00:12:52,306
to the left, the odds of target neutralization would have

223
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:54,478
increased by fifty percent, at minimum.

224
00:12:58,808 --> 00:13:00,764
The whole thing was so easy in rehearsal.

225
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,439
I was so sure of myself.

226
00:13:03,058 --> 00:13:05,990
I even fired from a less stable spot at totally nailed it.

227
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:09,848
But then, when it was real, I froze.

228
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:12,680
It's like my fingers got stiff
and my vision went all blurry.

229
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:14,705
Yeah, same here.

230
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,070
I just...

231
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:18,248
I caved under the pressure, you know?

232
00:13:18,838 --> 00:13:21,000
Too much was riding on me making the shot.

233
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:25,130
The moment of truth was nothing like what we practiced.

234
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:31,343
I feel like I could sleep for a month.

235
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:34,186
I vote we head back up to our rooms and crash.

236
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:35,973
I'm too tired to do anything.

237
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:38,024
You're just gonna call it a night?

238
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:40,310
We did what we were supposed to, what do you want?

239
00:13:40,514 --> 00:13:44,371
Granted the octopus is still kickin',
but we're owed a primo vacation either way!

240
00:13:44,514 --> 00:13:45,738
Truth, man.

241
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,489
I'm gonna spend all day tomorrow ogling gorgeous babes!

242
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:51,284
Just give me a few hours in
the sack, and ladies here I come!

243
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:53,430
It's all I can do to keep my head up.

244
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:01,740
Something seems off.

245
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:04,417
I mean, I know we're all exhausted, but...

246
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:08,556
Hey, do me a favor. Can I lean on your for a second?

247
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,524
I feel kinda...

248
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,139
Uh! Oh, no, Nakamura!

249
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:15,698
Oh. Wow. Awkward. Sorry.

250
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:17,145
I just wanted to go to the room.

251
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:20,251
Looks like my body has other ideas, huh?

252
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:22,491
You're burning up!

253
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,906
Thinkin' about all the hotties is makin' my nose bleed.

254
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:25,660
That's new.

255
00:14:28,264 --> 00:14:30,206
Okajima! Uh!

256
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:33,265
Uh! What's happening?

257
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:40,889
Call an ambulance, STAT! This is an emergency!

258
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:42,514
It'll take them a while to get here.

259
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:44,570
The nearest ER is on the mainland.

260
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:47,787
Huh?

261
00:14:56,654 --> 00:14:58,202
Hey, Teacher Man.

262
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:01,660
I'd say your students are in a bad way right about now.

263
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,817
Uh. And who is this?

264
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:05,465
Oh, no! Ritsu!

265
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:06,906
Take it easy, friend.

266
00:15:06,931 --> 00:15:09,161
There's no need for you to know who I am.

267
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:14,642
Just know your squad of snot-nosed punks
aren't the only ones tryin' to hit their mark.

268
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:17,639
You're telling me you're responsible for making them sick?

269
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:19,638
You're good.

270
00:15:20,114 --> 00:15:22,586
But they're a hell of a lot more than sick.

271
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,333
Their bodies are hosting a lab-manufactured virus.

272
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:28,764
Incubation period and specific symptoms vary,

273
00:15:28,848 --> 00:15:31,639
but the end result is the same. After about a week,

274
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,409
cells begin to rupture and vital organs become jelly.

275
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:38,230
The only known antidote is also lab-made.

276
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:41,147
Lucky for you, I am its sole possessor.

277
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:43,537
Trouble is, I'm lazy.

278
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,620
If you want it, you're gonna
have to come get it yourselves.

279
00:15:47,215 --> 00:15:50,155
There's a hotel on top of this island's highest peak.

280
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:52,984
Bring me your precious cargo, and we'll chat.

281
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:57,431
Top floor, within the hour. No tricks.

282
00:15:57,514 --> 00:15:59,348
And because you seem like the sort of man

283
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:01,995
I wouldn't want to tangle with, send proxies.

284
00:16:02,387 --> 00:16:03,384
Two students.

285
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:05,370
The shortest boy and shortest girl.

286
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:08,253
Out of whoever's still standing, of course.

287
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,079
There's a concierge desk across from the
elevators, have them go there. If all goes well,

288
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:17,348
you'll have the antidote, and I'll have the bounty.

289
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:20,005
Now, this should go without saying,

290
00:16:20,098 --> 00:16:23,389
but contact outside help or show up late, and boom.

291
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:25,323
The antidote goes bye-bye.

292
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:26,624
The infected die.

293
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:34,172
Hey, you guys were fantastic. With the target immobilized,
the hard part's done. I can't thank you enough.

294
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:37,498
Lady luck is definitely smiling down on our cause.

295
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:43,712
Damn it!

296
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:47,009
Of all the times for some
psychotic bastard to sabotage us!

297
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,208
Mr. Karasuma, I'm afraid they're not cooperating.

298
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:59,281
Even when we play the government
card, the hotel owners maintain

299
00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:01,295
they have the right to protect their guests' identity.

300
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:02,494
Naturally.

301
00:17:02,598 --> 00:17:03,533
Intolerable!

302
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:09,151
But not surprising. The resort our mystery man chose
is a known site for all manner of illegal operations.

303
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:13,212
Remote, shady history. It bares all the
trappings of an ideal rendezvous point.

304
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:16,037
The owners have connections
with Higher Ups in the government.

305
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:18,050
Law enforcement knows to leave it alone.

306
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,764
So basically there's no way of knowing
who the prick is before we meet him.

307
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:26,051
Ah! Are we really gonna take this psycho's word for it?

308
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:29,317
If he's bullshitting us about
the antidote, we're all gonna die!

309
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:31,446
Calm down, dude, it's fine.

310
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:34,441
We came here to be killers, not victims, remember?

311
00:17:34,697 --> 00:17:36,895
Look how far we've come. We'll figure this out.

312
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,098
Right. Yeah. I'll try to stay positive.

313
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:42,932
No way we just do what the asshole tells us to do.

314
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:45,507
I mean, come on, use the runts as a proxy?

315
00:17:45,996 --> 00:17:49,981
Send these two runt in to close the deal,
and we might as well lay down a die right now!

316
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:52,292
Okay, that was rude.

317
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:54,859
I'm sorry. I'm just pissed off that someone's got us

318
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:57,281
by the balls. And my friend's lives are in danger?

319
00:17:57,356 --> 00:17:58,552
Forget about it!

320
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:00,069
We're so gonna die.

321
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:04,223
I vote we ignore what the jackass wants us to do!

322
00:18:04,306 --> 00:18:06,598
Let's get everyone to the
hospital and forget this happened!

323
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:07,467
Bad idea.

324
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:12,528
If we are in fact dealing with a man-made
virus, a hospital would be a waste of time.

325
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:16,064
Not even the most state of the
art ER is be equipped to handle this.

326
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:17,843
There's no way for them to treat everyone.

327
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,536
We'd be dead before they even figured out what we have.

328
00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:22,046
Seriously?!

329
00:18:22,826 --> 00:18:25,288
I vote we focus on easing the symptoms for now.

330
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:27,672
You'd best start heading to the rendezvous point.

331
00:18:28,384 --> 00:18:29,880
That's the only way, huh?

332
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:32,994
Our hands are tied.

333
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:37,182
If Koro-Sensei could move, we might've had a chance.

334
00:18:37,697 --> 00:18:41,464
I'm starting to wish our assassination
attempt hadn't gone as well as it did.

335
00:18:42,643 --> 00:18:45,102
At the end of the day, this
is all happening because of you.

336
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,400
Gotta wonder if these kids'll be willing
to surrender their quarry so easily.

337
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:52,667
One hour. What the hell can we do?

338
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:55,941
I think I might have a solution.

339
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:56,496
Uh.

340
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:03,328
Koro-Sensei? Everything is ready, sir.

341
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:04,488
Excellent.

342
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:06,689
Ritsu's finished the prep work I asked her to do.

343
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:09,306
If the healthy students would step closer, please.

344
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:11,821
Be sure you're wearing something
you don't mind getting dirty.

345
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,422
Mm.

346
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:27,337
So high!

347
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:33,962
Uh?

348
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:39,181
I've successfully infiltrated their network. These are
the proprietary architectural schematics of the premises,

349
00:19:39,264 --> 00:19:41,137
complete with guard post locations.

350
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:46,389
The highest concentration of security staff
is stationed in and around the main entrance,

351
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:49,981
where it's functionally impossible to
enter without passing by the front desk.

352
00:19:50,514 --> 00:19:55,014
However, there is an alternate point of entry
along the building's side, just on top of this ledge.

353
00:19:55,156 --> 00:19:59,325
The terrain doesn't permit easy access,
so security, while present, isn't as strong.

354
00:20:01,614 --> 00:20:03,892
You don't want the madman to have his way, do you?

355
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:05,537
Courage, children!

356
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,110
Ten of your classmates are ill.

357
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:10,139
Two others have been left behind to care for them.

358
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,297
That leaves you to operate on their behalf.

359
00:20:12,598 --> 00:20:16,635
Sneak in, surprise our mysterious
adversary, and steal the antidote!

360
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:54,692
Irina Jelavich's...

361
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,648
Super-Secret Skills Series!

362
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:03,725
Did you know that Miss Irina can control her
circulation to change the color of her face?

363
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:05,529
Red indicates she's drunk.

364
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:07,431
Blue indicates feelings of ill health.

365
00:22:07,514 --> 00:22:09,907
All very effective tactics when going undercover.

366
00:22:10,806 --> 00:22:13,889
But, when she tried to showcase this
talent, the students accused her of being

367
00:22:13,973 --> 00:22:16,629
a knock-off of me and her face went red involuntarily.

368
00:22:17,098 --> 00:22:18,473
I've been doing this for years!

369
00:22:18,556 --> 00:22:20,021
Assassination Classroom!

370
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:21,785
Irina Jelavich's...

371
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:25,391
Super-Secret Skills Series.

372
00:22:26,598 --> 00:22:30,223
Did you know Miss Irina can arrange and
assemble an intricate hobby model in under a minute?

373
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:32,848
While this does speak volumes of her kissing technique,

374
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:35,338
we strongly recommend you not touch the finished product.

375
00:22:35,723 --> 00:22:37,427
Don't try this at home, boys and girls!

376
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:40,382
Assassination Classroom.

377
00:22:40,848 --> 00:22:43,735
Irina Jelavich's... Ah!

378
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:46,459
Super-Secret Skills Series.

379
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:48,848
Did you know that Miss Irina is a master of

380
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:51,556
disguise, able to pass herself off as practically anyone,

381
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:53,569
including some of your favorite characters?
