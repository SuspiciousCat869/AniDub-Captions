1
00:01:49,847 --> 00:01:50,332
Oh.

2
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:19,437
Uh.

3
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:46,791
Hm?

4
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:54,898
Hm?

5
00:19:48,097 --> 00:19:48,472
Eh?

6
00:20:27,888 --> 00:20:28,420
Hm.

7
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,972
Ugh.

8
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:13,507
Huh?

9
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:35,678
Hmm.

10
00:05:52,347 --> 00:05:53,043
Huh?

11
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:06,836
Huh?

12
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:14,794
Ouch.

13
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:16,093
Nice.

14
00:04:29,732 --> 00:04:30,432
Cake.

15
00:21:07,897 --> 00:21:08,452
Sure.

16
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:17,680
Sorry!

17
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:51,039
But...

18
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:53,722
Mh-hm.

19
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:47,681
Yoink!

20
00:01:24,638 --> 00:01:25,581
Yeah...

21
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:50,638
Sucker!

22
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,299
Takaoka?

23
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,062
Uh. I...

24
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:46,320
Stop it!

25
00:08:02,305 --> 00:08:03,271
Correct.

26
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:43,487
Watch it.

27
00:16:38,105 --> 00:16:39,154
Sorry, uh.

28
00:17:14,151 --> 00:17:15,497
Uh-uh-uh.

29
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:03,516
It's cake!

30
00:06:01,263 --> 00:06:01,998
Okay, then!

31
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:26,671
Oh, Nagisa.

32
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,349
Outrageous!

33
00:07:31,972 --> 00:07:33,301
Uh! Kanzaki!

34
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:09,180
Koro-sensei!

35
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:08,918
What? No way!

36
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,075
I'll be okay.

37
00:13:03,077 --> 00:13:04,100
I'm your guy.

38
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:34,329
Mr. Karasuma!

39
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:37,437
And the girls.

40
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:27,392
Nagisa Shiota.

41
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:01,426
Whoa! Is that?

42
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:56,778
That's enough.

43
00:15:32,435 --> 00:15:33,457
What the hell?

44
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:52,680
Think so, huh?

45
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:22,673
Remember that.

46
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,152
'Scuse me, sir?

47
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:54,513
What about you?

48
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,396
That's it. One.

49
00:21:23,263 --> 00:21:25,024
Please, please!

50
00:09:02,138 --> 00:09:04,207
Me? That's rich.

51
00:17:53,286 --> 00:17:54,305
To teach is also.

52
00:18:44,283 --> 00:18:45,396
Principal Asano.

53
00:00:19,388 --> 00:00:20,731
Catlike reflexes.

54
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:56,539
Eh. I'll survive.

55
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:28,110
Looks like I win.

56
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:17,523
And yet, here I am.

57
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:37,518
No, sir, we won't.

58
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,615
Nagisa. You're up.

59
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:04,308
Oh, wait a second.

60
00:20:30,138 --> 00:20:31,770
Mr. Karasuma, sir?

61
00:00:26,138 --> 00:00:27,198
Then there's Karma.

62
00:01:21,763 --> 00:01:22,714
Eyes on the target.

63
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,890
Hey, hey, Karasuma!

64
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:22,798
This is ridiculous!

65
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:13,025
Affection and fear.

66
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,125
This is ridiculous!

67
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:52,995
Still, look at 'em.

68
00:13:28,431 --> 00:13:29,707
Ready when you are.

69
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:39,388
Dodge. Taunt. Beat.

70
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:53,138
Am I the Class Mom?

71
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:15,933
Another new teacher?

72
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:51,336
for the whole class.

73
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:08,680
What's the big deal?

74
00:13:39,472 --> 00:13:41,377
Wash, rinse, repeat.

75
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:04,220
It's dawning on him.

76
00:17:05,654 --> 00:17:06,768
Hope it was worth it.

77
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:54,972
And it must be said,

78
00:19:10,428 --> 00:19:12,051
Your walking papers.

79
00:07:23,388 --> 00:07:24,617
I'm not much for P.E.

80
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:42,500
Mr. Karasuma, please.

81
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:17,551
Patience. You'll see.

82
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,401
This is gonna be fun.

83
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,760
You ungrateful punks!

84
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:34,174
Please, help yourself.

85
00:10:17,388 --> 00:10:18,847
Here's what I propose.

86
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,042
Ow! What was that for?

87
00:01:46,222 --> 00:01:47,597
Sorry, no. I'd love to,

88
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,555
Wait. Hold up, hold up.

89
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:49,573
Someone needs a lesson.

90
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:45,472
you can't rely on toys.

91
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:07,842
Oh, come on. This twig?

92
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:05,265
is nothing but a brute.

93
00:00:02,722 --> 00:00:04,138
Keep eyes on the target.

94
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:18,840
Yo! Name's Akira Takaoka.

95
00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:10,613
We have ten periods now?

96
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:12,596
We train till 9:00 P.M.?

97
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:38,822
I just need to kill him.

98
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:45,359
Walk towards him calmly.

99
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:21,680
Ah. I'm good, no worries.

100
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,988
Yeah, don't get me wrong,

101
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:39,305
He speaks their language.

102
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,340
So I'll give him a smile.

103
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,360
All right, everybody here?

104
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,065
I'll take that, thank you.

105
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:27,764
That's all there is to it.

106
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:42,471
That won't be unnecessary.

107
00:19:24,469 --> 00:19:26,447
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it!

108
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,222
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

109
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,782
Pleased to meet 'cha, gang!

110
00:08:35,446 --> 00:08:36,571
'Cause that's what this is,

111
00:16:16,597 --> 00:16:18,004
Have you lost your marbles?

112
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:30,698
When you try to be our dad,

113
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,189
but he treats us as equals.

114
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:07,855
And I do not employ brutes.

115
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,281
But I was only trying to...

116
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:00,752
but he's got what it takes.

117
00:00:56,888 --> 00:00:58,445
No one wants your two cents.

118
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:37,888
Young people respond to him.

119
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:49,843
Hey, did he twist your neck?

120
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:00,640
I need you to shut him down.

121
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:36,097
This is seriously not funny.

122
00:11:56,142 --> 00:11:57,912
Do I even have a star pupil?

123
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,221
What? Wait, are you kidding?

124
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:20,465
But I'll tell you something.

125
00:20:53,506 --> 00:20:55,347
Ha. Oh yeah? For doing what?

126
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,256
In Phys Ed, I call the shots.

127
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:02,757
Somebody has to do something.

128
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:47,363
I guess you could buy your...

129
00:20:57,939 --> 00:20:59,270
Au contraire, boys and girls!

130
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,767
When they work together, often
as not, their blades hit home.

131
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,472
First off, this is school. We
gotta think about grades, too.

132
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,519
When are we supposed to stu...

133
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:38,560
The only answer here is "yes."

134
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,363
What, are you gonna attack me?

135
00:09:23,972 --> 00:09:26,847
If I can shape the other half
into octopus-killin' warriors,

136
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,706
pummel the poor bastard within
an inch of his life, unarmed,

137
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:23,137
I don't think so. Guy's a pro.

138
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:40,922
He's approachable, he's cool,
and he's got nothing to prove.

139
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:06,538
And that's only the beginning.

140
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:47,754
That makes one of us at least.

141
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,504
Whatever. Let's go, Class Dad!

142
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,972
Gross! Is that how he grovels?

143
00:00:06,347 --> 00:00:07,680
If you can't predict his moves,

144
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:46,197
We were wondering if you'd like
to grab a bite to eat with us.

145
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:05,229
I just, I don't know. You think
it's only 'cause he has to be?

146
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:15,430
You really know your way around
brand-name sweets, don't 'cha?

147
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,305
How you kosher with this idiot?

148
00:05:21,403 --> 00:05:24,236
If he was a toupee, a chinstrap
couldn't make him look phonier.

149
00:08:21,597 --> 00:08:24,768
Nothing I've done falls outside
acceptable corporal punishment.

150
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:56,643
That's why I'm counting on you.

151
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:15,135
This is gonna be a train wreck.

152
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,637
Stakes are pretty high when
the knife in your hand is real.

153
00:17:56,989 --> 00:18:00,308
to do so by drawing from the
well of their confidence in us.

154
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:29,532
Don't give him another thought.

155
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:34,821
The man got handed a pink slip?

156
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:40,512
Okano's gymnastics background
makes her moves hard to predict.

157
00:04:03,972 --> 00:04:06,138
Handmade éclairs from Le Hermes!

158
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:21,225
Built like a truck and adorable.

159
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:51,432
but taking on the role of father
figure might be more effective.

160
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,120
Set 'em on me, and if their
knife so much as grazes my aura,

161
00:10:34,097 --> 00:10:36,013
We won't be using these, though.

162
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:57,696
He wants to use an actual knife?

163
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:35,523
Not something you see every day.

164
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:47,640
Springing on them like a python.

165
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:16,730
But he points the way to the
best future he can see for them.

166
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:54,846
A man of grit and character
whom none have the heart to kill.

167
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:44,519
He's nice to us and all, but
you're like the neighborhood dad.

168
00:10:05,347 --> 00:10:07,043
Waitin' to make this interesting.

169
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:48,148
So we'll be using the real McCoy.

170
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:50,684
I'm not sure of anything anymore.

171
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:06,739
Even Koro-sensei gets thrown off.

172
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:25,937
Mr. Karasuma is our P.E. teacher.

173
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:17,588
and I intend to keep it that way.

174
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,110
I don't think he realizes it yet,

175
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:43,969
Meg easily has the reach and
momentum of her male counterparts.

176
00:07:02,013 --> 00:07:04,874
We're gonna save the world, kids,
and we're gonna do it as a family.

177
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,876
Try moving your head side to side.

178
00:14:58,453 --> 00:15:00,598
That's right. You're about to die.

179
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:20,244
He could have been hurt, or worse!

180
00:16:41,363 --> 00:16:43,099
Sincerely, though. You're awesome!

181
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,543
What if Nagisa said he wanted
to be an assassin when he grew up?

182
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:22,864
How badly does he want this stuff?

183
00:00:59,222 --> 00:01:01,996
Truth be told, the other
students may have a long way to go,

184
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:24,363
So, whaddya say? Ready to have fun?

185
00:04:21,597 --> 00:04:24,972
So, you're gonna take over P.E.
to help Mr. Karasuma get caught up?

186
00:04:45,706 --> 00:04:47,306
"Dad." I like me the sound of that!

187
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:16,738
Don't be glum! Think of the payoff!

188
00:06:26,555 --> 00:06:28,305
I mean, c'mon! We can't go by this.

189
00:08:26,888 --> 00:08:28,347
That doesn't leave me a lotta time.

190
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,618
Are his methods as bad as all that?

191
00:11:42,864 --> 00:11:46,585
Maybe his take-no-prisoners policy
is what saving the world calls for.

192
00:13:08,031 --> 00:13:10,099
Eyes must be goin' in your old age.

193
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:34,832
One strike. I just need one strike.

194
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:09,670
And you're nothing compared to him.

195
00:16:08,694 --> 00:16:11,839
Game, set, and match, Mr. Karasuma.

196
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:41,005
I needed to make sure that was you.

197
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,065
That whole ordeal was a total rush!

198
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:13,412
Moreover, to do by drawing from
the well of their confidence in us.

199
00:20:35,395 --> 00:20:37,968
maybe we've got something in
the way of a li'l thank you coming?

200
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:41,023
That's what you want in an educator.

201
00:09:29,972 --> 00:09:33,643
You'll be lickin' my boots till
the day they put you out to pasture.

202
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,736
Just remember, we're teachers first.

203
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:14,307
This little trick works
beautifully in the big leagues, too.

204
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:18,550
Take a fresh-faced recruit
wielding a blade for the first time,

205
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:25,013
and bingo! Instant Alpha Dog status.

206
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:31,893
Or save us the headache and agree
to let me run this show from now on.

207
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,646
The least you kids deserve for being
put in this situation is my respect.

208
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:24,847
So if you don't feel comfortable,
you don't have to take up the knife.

209
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:55,763
If he sees fit to hand me the knife,

210
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:57,807
I'll trust his decision and take it.

211
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:30,970
Just remember Mr. Karasuma's advice.

212
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:42,690
The way he strolls up to the target,

213
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:32,469
it just makes us feel like children.

214
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,951
Does that mean Mr. Karasuma's
back to being our gym teacher again?

215
00:20:23,436 --> 00:20:26,708
The pleasure of seeing them do so
is what makes this job exhilarating!

216
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:19,023
Take Isogai and Maehara, for example.

217
00:01:17,763 --> 00:01:19,504
That block was a little over the top.

218
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,555
You gotta see stuff like that comin'.

219
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,854
That's the idea, little grasshoppers!

220
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:35,772
Rule number one. We don't do "can't."

221
00:07:19,762 --> 00:07:21,525
Actually, sir, to tell you the truth.

222
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,805
I gotta train these kids to kill you.

223
00:09:36,172 --> 00:09:38,689
300 squats? We're gonna freakin' die!

224
00:12:33,617 --> 00:12:35,761
This man always looks me in the eyes.

225
00:18:29,595 --> 00:18:32,551
I'll negotiate with my superiors
to put things back the way they were.

226
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:52,753
I came to see our new hire in action.

227
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,273
We were wondering, since we kind
of got your job back for you and all,

228
00:20:38,064 --> 00:20:41,869
Yeah. Mr. Takaoka would've given
us a buncha sweets for being so good.

229
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:53,089
Zero chinks in his personal life, too.

230
00:04:27,722 --> 00:04:29,513
Poor guy needs some time to himself...

231
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:42,805
If anybody else needs a dose of good
old fashioned nonverbal reinforcement,

232
00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:45,107
Daddy Dearest will be happy to oblige.

233
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:20,438
I may not be much of a father
figure, but I appreciate your dilemma.

234
00:12:58,055 --> 00:13:00,763
Either way, Takaoka is out of control.

235
00:19:18,795 --> 00:19:21,054
This is my school and my school alone.

236
00:20:50,722 --> 00:20:53,363
Uh, surely I deserve some thanks, too?

237
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,258
Every day these kids show more promise.

238
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,805
This is my interior monologue, damn it.

239
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:32,878
Ah! And this fella must be Koro-sensei.

240
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:41,930
You know, sir, for bein' colleagues,
you and Mr. Karasuma are night and day.

241
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:08,307
but stick it out like the champs I know
you are and we're talkin' more sweets!

242
00:08:11,138 --> 00:08:13,597
while my back was turned, it stops now.

243
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:39,140
Wish I could say I was sure about this.

244
00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:16,513
Giving one of my students a real knife!

245
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:04,917
A student confidently answers a
question you yourself were troubled by.

246
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:27,451
He's not in a position to threaten you.

247
00:00:04,222 --> 00:00:06,146
Right. Don't let yourself be distracted.

248
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,472
If this is too much for you, sit it out.

249
00:07:06,847 --> 00:07:10,930
There are two essential ingredients
needed to earn loyalty of your students.

250
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:39,615
you just don't care for the way I teach.

251
00:08:49,388 --> 00:08:51,138
And he's right, and I don't care for it,

252
00:09:13,937 --> 00:09:16,083
never gave a damn about what I could do.

253
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,638
Cherry pick your star pupils out of the
students you've trained by your methods.

254
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:51,493
Treat this like any other assassination.

255
00:15:13,406 --> 00:15:15,955
Here, let me help you down. There we go.

256
00:15:42,993 --> 00:15:45,280
hiding his intent until the last second.

257
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,786
You'll get this job over my dead body...

258
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:45,737
Well now, I'm not much of a connoisseur.

259
00:00:27,347 --> 00:00:29,847
At first blush, all sarcasm and laziness,

260
00:01:38,388 --> 00:01:40,180
Man, I'm having no luck hitting that guy.

261
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:01,789
He's super cool and everything, I mean...

262
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:37,376
Heh. Don't wanna die on an empty stomach.

263
00:08:17,222 --> 00:08:19,359
You teach your subjects, I'll teach mine.

264
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:52,648
Disrespecting daddy makes him very angry!

265
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:43,597
When the object is to kill a human being,

266
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,288
These kids aren't prepared to take
down a real human being, and you know it!

267
00:12:46,116 --> 00:12:48,290
And I can't imagine why he's choosing me.

268
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:25,505
Hell, how would you do with a real knife?

269
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,055
He intends to make an example out of you.

270
00:15:17,144 --> 00:15:19,148
You can block from the front. No problem.

271
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:00,658
Granted, fear is the engine of education,

272
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:13,072
so we could stare at these babies all day!

273
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,926
Ha. Sorry, big guy. This isn't your class.

274
00:09:08,388 --> 00:09:10,539
Me stealin' these kids out from under you.

275
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:06,151
Was I s'posed to use the back of my knife?

276
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:51,722
If ever a man was unsure of himself
right up to the moment of truth, it's you.

277
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,455
Mr. Karasuma may come off as all business,

278
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:44,266
Thanks for trying, but he's the Class Dad.

279
00:00:10,832 --> 00:00:13,017
Not too shabby for four months of training.

280
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,907
You're on par with this fellow, are ya not?

281
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:13,764
You were always top dog of our old brigade,

282
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:09,496
In my eyes, we're all fellow soldiers on a
mission to save the Earth from destruction.

283
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:53,311
This goes beyond the instincts of a killer.

284
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,595
Whatever you do, you're not the boss of us.

285
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:56,847
to confront such answers head on. Moreover,

286
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,429
Don't forget Koro-sensei. The ideal teacher.

287
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:04,678
Now, things are gonna be tougher than usual,

288
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:44,703
Show me a family where the dad ain't in
charge and I'll show you a family in crisis.

289
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,347
Over a dispute about educational philosophy?

290
00:09:05,638 --> 00:09:08,305
Bet this really grinds your gears, Karasuma.

291
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:31,486
not force you into it kicking and screaming.

292
00:13:18,943 --> 00:13:20,888
You think Nagisa will get anywhere near him?

293
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:20,597
and I'm here to give your gym teacher a hand.

294
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:27,113
Even Karma can tell, and he's not here today.

295
00:06:16,763 --> 00:06:20,222
This curriculum will turn you into lean,
mean killing' machines! You're gonna love it!

296
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:11,055
Whatever you've been filling their heads with.

297
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:30,211
I don't have the luxury of goin' easy on 'em.

298
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,623
your methods are nothing short of a travesty.

299
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,404
Alas, such dilemma's come with the territory.

300
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:07,655
We can show you all the best places to buy...

301
00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:08,755
Um, these look sorta pricy, sir. Are you sure?

302
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,750
How could I put one of these kids on the spot?

303
00:14:11,873 --> 00:14:14,319
I can't take the life of another human being."

304
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,055
And before he knows what's up, this gets real.

305
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:13,719
Every teacher secretly frets over whether the
path he sets his students on is the right one.

306
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:51,613
Life's too short not to spend it with
people ya think of as family, am I right, gang?

307
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:30,043
Look, he and I go back to the Airborne Brigade.

308
00:10:00,071 --> 00:10:05,136
Ah! There it is. I was wonderin' when you
were gonna throw your chips in, old buddy. Heh.

309
00:10:08,763 --> 00:10:11,088
Who are you to criticize how I choose to teach?

310
00:10:11,222 --> 00:10:14,597
If this is something you an' me need to
settle like men, then I'm up for the challenge.

311
00:11:02,552 --> 00:11:06,729
Don't get all concerned citizen on me,
they ain't gotta kill nothin', just come close.

312
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:53,597
You don't have to be stronger than your target.

313
00:15:19,347 --> 00:15:22,365
But when it's an attack from behind? Good luck.

314
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:50,746
That explains the chill I got from him earlier.

315
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,664
Pretty sure you're quick enough on your feet to
have kept that from happening. Still, though...

316
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:49,782
I trust you'll forgive the intrusion, everyone.

317
00:04:08,854 --> 00:04:11,488
Yeah! Chow down, kiddos! I didn't break the bank.

318
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:34,176
We're not best friends or anything, but based
on the information I have, he's a great teacher.

319
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:55,492
That said, I'd much rather see you stick it out.

320
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:28,912
Our duty as teachers is to prepare you for life,

321
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,387
Just get one good strike in and the job is done.

322
00:15:01,876 --> 00:15:04,284
No one keeps it together when they realize that.

323
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:14,990
But this place is really starting to grow on me.

324
00:01:02,097 --> 00:01:04,396
but they've come a lot further than I dared hope.

325
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:14,430
Nope, nope. Don't wanna ruin this girlish figure.

326
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:40,006
Rule number two. We're a family, and I'm the dad.

327
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,222
I'm not gonna go full throttle on my beloved fam!

328
00:09:21,097 --> 00:09:23,888
Let half of these snot-nosed punks be pulverized.

329
00:09:45,055 --> 00:09:47,801
Mr. Karasuma ain't part of our family, doll-face.

330
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,491
Whatever our differences are, we share that goal.

331
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:13,300
What would possess that dumb bastard to pick him?

332
00:14:22,911 --> 00:14:27,842
Okay, this is bound to be a little different
than what I'm used to, so I need to stay focused.

333
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,302
Could you lead him there with a clear conscience?

334
00:05:45,255 --> 00:05:48,023
My approach was to draw a line, stay professional,

335
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:28,121
If I have to do it, I prefer Mr. Karasuma's class.

336
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:28,183
What're you waiting for? Pick yourself a champion.

337
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:46,703
It's important you understand this is real to him.

338
00:14:46,496 --> 00:14:49,601
Totally nonchalant. Like I'm on the way to school.

339
00:18:07,062 --> 00:18:09,756
To teach is also to confront such answers head on.

340
00:18:36,053 --> 00:18:38,484
It's gonna take more than that to be done with me!

341
00:20:02,956 --> 00:20:05,430
That's certainly a tricky one, I'll give you that.

342
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:19,472
Questions of right and wrong are often open-ended.

343
00:01:40,263 --> 00:01:42,847
There's, like, zero chinks in Mr. Karasuma's armor.

344
00:01:55,972 --> 00:01:58,389
It's like there's a wall of ice between him and us.

345
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:50,089
I'll have my people back at HQ send in replacements.

346
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:07,623
Except they're not your "fam." They're my students.

347
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,055
The man will crush those children, body and spirit.

348
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:47,555
That smile on your face right before you got him...

349
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:02,680
You think it's fun shaming your father figure, huh?

350
00:00:07,763 --> 00:00:10,125
you can't effectively counter his evasive maneuvers.

351
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,791
it'll be me reapin' the glory when the deed is done.

352
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,624
He's thinking, "Wait a second, this is for keepsies.

353
00:15:35,865 --> 00:15:39,455
Son of a bitch. The talent this kid's got in unreal.

354
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:34,410
I just did what Mr. Karasuma told me to, that's all.

355
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:19,256
Not gonna lie, if we went for a round two, I'd lose.

356
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:03,055
I was scrutinizing your plight in thoughtful
silence in hopes of demonstrating to Mr. Karasuma...

357
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:19,055
Trust me. When it comes to the good stuff, it's love.

358
00:07:33,326 --> 00:07:35,994
Looks like we're having a little communications gaff.

359
00:08:51,222 --> 00:08:54,839
but civility dictates I let him teach as he sees fit.

360
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:20,461
throwin' a monkey wrench into your shot at promotion.

361
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:32,300
No fuss. No back pedaling. I'll pack it in and leave.

362
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:20,681
There's nothin' sweeter than the sight of a
rookie turning pale at the thought of his first kill.

363
00:17:02,803 --> 00:17:05,457
Having the time of your lives pretending you've won?!

364
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,055
but behind that facade lurks the instinct of a killer.

365
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:40,683
My own family can't even do that. But him? No problem.

366
00:15:58,526 --> 00:16:02,521
But should I nurture a gift like his, or shut it down?

367
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:31,888
Easy, guys. Let's not make a big deal out of it, okay?

368
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:15,896
The Ministry of Defensive does not call the shots here.

369
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,471
I might have my share of doubts about being a teacher.

370
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,650
but there's still a lot of work that needs to get done.

371
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:55,888
He's definitely a man who prefers to keep his distance.

372
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:27,670
Yep! Those are my marchin' orders from the brass at HQ.

373
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:45,083
I think maybe I've been going about this the wrong way.

374
00:06:56,555 --> 00:07:01,514
A father loves each of his children unconditionally.
The thought of losing even one of 'em breaks his heart.

375
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,589
See? We're fine! Don't go gettin' your boxers in a wad.

376
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:09,702
And I'll do you a solid by defending myself barehanded.

377
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:45,654
Man. There must be so much he's not allowed to tell us.

378
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:25,333
Sorry if my colleague's a bit too big for his britches.

379
00:19:41,803 --> 00:19:45,539
I see the principal's confident as ever in his methods.

380
00:00:45,347 --> 00:00:48,347
These are the standout, would-be assassins of the group.

381
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:31,128
What the... Did I just have a momentary lapse of sanity?

382
00:05:08,403 --> 00:05:11,627
For us, or are you really just saving them for yourself?

383
00:10:26,347 --> 00:10:29,019
I'll concede that the way you train is superior to mine.

384
00:15:53,781 --> 00:15:57,945
Nagisa isn't a normal boy. He's a natural-born assassin.

385
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:03,763
but a teacher able to instill fear only through violence.

386
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,828
You've pretty much been on the sidelines the whole time.

387
00:07:13,794 --> 00:07:17,474
Well? You're gonna do everything father tells you to, eh?

388
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:59,931
If you hurt these kids, then you'll have to answer to me.

389
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:37,296
Time to school these kids in the art of real humiliation.

390
00:15:10,469 --> 00:15:13,213
Once you lose your balance, all it takes is a little tug.

391
00:17:06,837 --> 00:17:12,599
'cause daddy's about rip you apart. Mind, body, and soul!

392
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,681
We ask them, but the students must live their own answer.

393
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:05,597
Along with your new training regimen comes a new schedule!
