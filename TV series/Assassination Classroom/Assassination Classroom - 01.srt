1
00:00:48,127 --> 00:00:49,735
All right, people.

2
00:00:50,313 --> 00:00:52,313
Let's get started, shall we?

3
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:54,707
Class Monitor, if you would do the honors.

4
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:57,210
Right! Ready!

5
00:01:00,085 --> 00:01:00,775
Aim!

6
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:05,934
Fire!

7
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:11,041
Oh. Oh, my.

8
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:14,979
Well, why don't I just call roll
while you children wear yourselves out?

9
00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:16,384
Isogai?

10
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:17,417
Here.

11
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:18,688
What's that?

12
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:21,377
I'm afraid I couldn't make it out over all the gunfire.

13
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,191
Here!

14
00:01:22,543 --> 00:01:23,281
Okajima?

15
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:24,098
Here!

16
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:25,227
Okuda!

17
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,061
Here!

18
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:27,085
Kataoka?

19
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:27,902
Here!

20
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:28,689
Kayano?

21
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:29,627
Here!

22
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:30,319
Kanzaki!

23
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,049
Here!

24
00:01:33,168 --> 00:01:35,967
Excellent. All present and accounted for.

25
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:38,042
No tardies! Congratulations!

26
00:01:39,377 --> 00:01:40,266
He's fast.

27
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,270
The whole class opened fire and
he doesn't even have a scratch.

28
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,127
Yep.

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,846
We're assassins, and our target...

30
00:01:49,163 --> 00:01:50,087
is our teacher.

31
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:51,691
No luck today either, eh?

32
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,168
That's really too bad.

33
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,807
What's the lesson here?

34
00:01:54,832 --> 00:01:57,374
Numbers are no substitute for inventiveness, perhaps?

35
00:01:57,543 --> 00:01:59,702
That any hack can point a gun and pull a trigger?

36
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:01,707
Some of Column A, some of Column B?

37
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:05,293
I get that you were trying to cast the
net as widely as possible, so to speak,

38
00:02:05,318 --> 00:02:07,046
but the approach lacked originality.

39
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,293
When the target clocks at Mach Twenty,

40
00:02:09,377 --> 00:02:11,729
an assassin has to think outside the box.

41
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:14,116
Ha. Right. Mach Twenty.

42
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:16,622
No freaking way did you dodge that hail of bullets!

43
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:17,766
He's got a point.

44
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:19,505
I mean, these are only BBs, right?

45
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:22,549
For all we know, you just stood
there and took 'em like a champ.

46
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:28,573
Collect the ammunition and bring it here.

47
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:32,099
As was explained, these are anti-me BB's.

48
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:34,030
Harmless to you, but...

49
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:39,291
Able to split my cells like a knife through warm tofu.

50
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:43,086
Developed by your government for that express purpose.

51
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:47,464
Of course, after a few seconds,
I can regenerate good as new.

52
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:51,233
A luxury you won't have if you
accidentally shoot your eye out.

53
00:02:52,286 --> 00:02:53,111
From now on,

54
00:02:53,252 --> 00:02:55,076
no discharging guns in the classroom.

55
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:56,514
Safety first.

56
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,060
And good luck killing me before graduation.

57
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:01,536
You're going to need it.

58
00:03:02,163 --> 00:03:05,418
Firearms and government issue anti-me BB's away, please.

59
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:06,644
Time to get to work.

60
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,997
Kunugigaoka Junior High, class Three-E.

61
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:11,989
The Assassination classroom.

62
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,605
The bell rings, another day begins.

63
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,494
Okay, here's a puzzler for you.

64
00:04:58,987 --> 00:04:59,612
Isogai!

65
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:00,915
Uh, sir?

66
00:05:01,146 --> 00:05:04,030
Which of these four tentacles is the odd man out?

67
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:06,207
Um, the blue one?

68
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,335
Excellent!

69
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,006
"The boy who is standing"
employs "who" as a relative pronoun.

70
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:12,596
Hey, Nagisa.

71
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:13,429
Check it out.

72
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:18,377
Crescent moon's up. During the day.

73
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,268
Neat, huh?

74
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,797
How did this happen?

75
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:24,354
How did we get here?

76
00:05:25,378 --> 00:05:31,934
I mean, as far as I know, it all started
with two very big things kicking off third year.

77
00:05:45,816 --> 00:05:47,315
First, there was the moon.

78
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:50,604
One minute, it's fine, the next, kaboom.

79
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,241
Permanent crescent.

80
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:58,168
Ahh... We interrupt our currently scheduled
program for this breaking news bulletin...

81
00:05:58,252 --> 00:05:59,217
This just in.

82
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:01,620
A portion of the moon has been vaporized.

83
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,102
Some sources estimate over 70%.

84
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:05,231
I repeat, four...

85
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:06,716
What does it mean?

86
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,994
Astronomers the world over are
struggling to figure out just that.

87
00:06:10,882 --> 00:06:13,432
There was that, and then there was him.

88
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:15,275
Hello! How are you?

89
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:18,603
So, I'm the one who blew up the moon.

90
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:19,716
Huh?!

91
00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:23,219
Next year, I intend to do the same to Planet Earth.

92
00:06:23,318 --> 00:06:27,383
But never mind that now, I'm gonna be
your new teacher! Isn't that exciting?!

93
00:06:27,984 --> 00:06:30,275
There are so many things wrong with this picture.

94
00:06:30,502 --> 00:06:32,278
It was a strong first impression.

95
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:34,852
Uh, I'm Karasuma.

96
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:36,460
I'm from the Ministry of Defense.

97
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,710
What, uh, what I'm about to tell you

98
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:40,667
we in the business call "classified."

99
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:45,394
Aw, hell. I'll just come right out with it.

100
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:49,104
I'm gonna need you to kill this
thing for the sake of mankind.

101
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:51,877
Excuse me.

102
00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:55,929
No offense, is this a joke? 'Cause if
that's the alien who blew up the moon...

103
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:57,127
A-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah!

104
00:06:57,152 --> 00:06:59,630
I am an Earthling born and bred, thank you very much!

105
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:00,966
Uh. Okay.

106
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:04,293
I'm not at liberty to discuss
the details at this juncture.

107
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:06,226
I'll just say he's telling the truth.

108
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,719
His threat is all too real.

109
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,357
As of this coming March.

110
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:13,083
He will obliterate the Earth.

111
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:17,603
Apart from you, the only people
who know this are world leaders.

112
00:07:17,793 --> 00:07:19,668
If word of this leaks out to the public,

113
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:21,973
we'll have widespread panic on our hands.

114
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:26,875
He must be terminated soon and with extreme prejudice.

115
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:31,077
Which means that you must become assassins.

116
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:34,582
Now, you'll notice he's incredibly fast!

117
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:39,196
And for some reason, he likes
grooming eyebrows... immaculately!

118
00:07:41,882 --> 00:07:46,236
You're looking at a being so powerful he
can obliterate over half the moon in seconds.

119
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:48,761
So fast, he's been clocked at Mach Twenty.

120
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:54,666
A world where he's allowed to live is a
world waiting to be destroyed, plain and simple.

121
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:58,017
He makes it all sound so grim, doesn't he?

122
00:07:58,418 --> 00:07:59,210
Cheer up!

123
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:01,411
I've graciously made your government an offer.

124
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:04,210
"Stop making fools of yourselves
trying to kill me," I said.

125
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:07,640
"And let me teach Class Three-E
at this illustrious institution!"

126
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,094
Seriously?

127
00:08:09,747 --> 00:08:11,303
We didn't have much of a choice.

128
00:08:11,877 --> 00:08:13,846
We have no idea what his motives are,

129
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:18,151
but we agreed on the condition that none
of you students would be harmed in any way.

130
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:20,241
The advantage is twofold.

131
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:25,516
On the one hand, we'll know his whereabouts a
good portion of every weekday, which is something.

132
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,759
On the other, he'll be in close range to thirty
people with the means and incentive to kill him.

133
00:08:33,377 --> 00:08:34,122
Nakamura!

134
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:38,893
I distinctly remember saying no
guns discharging in the classroom!

135
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:39,863
I know...

136
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:41,247
Back row, young lady.

137
00:08:41,293 --> 00:08:42,718
Think about what you've done.

138
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:45,828
Why would this "thing" want to be our teacher?

139
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:48,620
And how are we going to assassinate
him if the government can't?

140
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:52,256
Those're the questions we should have asked
at the start, but I guess we got distracted.

141
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:56,285
Do the deed and you get ten billion.

142
00:08:57,294 --> 00:08:58,328
It's only fair.

143
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:00,950
Kill him, save the Earth.

144
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:04,183
If that doesn't deserve a life on
Easy Street, what are we fighting for?

145
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,085
He doesn't think can do it.

146
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:06,979
Use that.

147
00:09:07,116 --> 00:09:09,616
Green stripes indicate he's feeling superior.

148
00:09:10,002 --> 00:09:11,962
We have some experience with it.

149
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:12,732
Freaky.

150
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:14,566
Truth be told, I'm not worried.

151
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:17,937
The military couldn't kill me, why
would anyone assume students could?

152
00:09:18,402 --> 00:09:21,444
After all, you don't even have fighter jets!

153
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:31,371
Hard to keep tidy, fighter jets.

154
00:09:31,898 --> 00:09:33,429
What's with the cleaning fetish?

155
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:34,931
It's all on you.

156
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:38,405
Find the cracks in this smug
bastard's defenses and exploit them.

157
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,807
The weapons you'll be provided are
harmless to humans but extremely fatal to him.

158
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:44,752
And, it goes without saying,

159
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,526
we'll need to keep this between us.

160
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:48,042
The clock is ticking.

161
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:50,643
Decide whether you'll stand for our home

162
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,451
being blasted to space dust.

163
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:54,772
That should just about cover it, I think.

164
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,037
What do you say we hit the books and make
the final year of your lives a productive one?

165
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:05,258
So that's it. We have a year to live.

166
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:07,856
If we can't find a way to kill our teacher,

167
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:09,977
Earth is gonna be history.

168
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:18,194
Oh? That's lunchtime, everybody.

169
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:21,545
Excuse me while I pop over to China for a quick bite.

170
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:27,043
You have my cell number, any killers feeling
especially trigger-happy today are welcome to hit me up.

171
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:31,119
Okay, math...

172
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:32,870
If he's traveling at Mach Twenty...

173
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:36,363
It'll take ten minutes tops to reach
his favorite take-out place in Sichuan.

174
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:38,110
So, just to be clear:

175
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,034
We've absolutely ruled out missiles?

176
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,202
Are you kidding?

177
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:43,227
Even if we had access to that kind of hardware,

178
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:44,543
he can break the sound barrier.

179
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:45,602
While grading.

180
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,097
My homework even came back with a doodle on it.

181
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,768
All things considered, you have
to admit he's not doing a bad job.

182
00:10:51,793 --> 00:10:56,511
I know, right? He tutored me on algebra
and I killed it on our pop quiz the next day!

183
00:10:56,976 --> 00:10:58,743
Yeah. Kind of a shame.

184
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,128
We get our grades up just in time for the world to end.

185
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,385
Well, college wasn't happening either way.

186
00:11:05,337 --> 00:11:08,335
Flying super-cephalopod bent on world-destruction?

187
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:08,857
Check.

188
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:10,360
Impossible target?

189
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:11,027
Check.

190
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:14,662
But he might be the best damn
teacher any of us has ever had.

191
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:17,218
Forget that we're all would-be assassins,

192
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,909
and that most people probably see us
as average, garden variety third years.

193
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,174
At least on the surface. Underneath it all, though.

194
00:11:24,728 --> 00:11:26,876
Class Three-E has always been different.

195
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,300
Yo, Nagisa.

196
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,643
Look alive, little man.

197
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:35,454
Time to put our money where
our mouth is and get this done.

198
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:36,852
Mm...

199
00:11:39,718 --> 00:11:43,458
So we know the octopus's face changes
color depending on what mood he's in.

200
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:46,755
Have you been keeping track like I asked? Gimme the specs.

201
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:47,931
You got it.

202
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:51,720
I guess for starters, green stripes mean he feels cocky.

203
00:11:51,872 --> 00:11:52,838
So that's something.

204
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:56,336
When we give a wrong answer, his face goes dark purple.

205
00:11:57,211 --> 00:11:59,116
When we answer correctly, bright red.

206
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:01,918
What's interesting is every
day after lunch, without fail...

207
00:12:02,002 --> 00:12:03,710
Blah blah, whatever!

208
00:12:04,877 --> 00:12:06,291
We got more 'n enough.

209
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,174
When his guard's down, that's when we make our move.

210
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:11,002
Well, at least you do.

211
00:12:11,502 --> 00:12:13,600
Yeah. About that, I...

212
00:12:13,877 --> 00:12:15,730
Don't start! We've been over this!

213
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:17,478
Worried about your transcript?!

214
00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:19,753
Wake up, dude! We're Three-E!

215
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:22,411
Everyone expects us to be thugs and murderers anyway!

216
00:12:23,112 --> 00:12:25,278
You know what the E stands for, right?

217
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:26,873
End of the line.

218
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:30,548
Think they shuttle us up this
mountain every day for the view?

219
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:34,377
Sorry to burst your bubble,
man, but society don't want us.

220
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,752
When do nobodies like us have a shot
at the kind of cash at stake here?!

221
00:12:38,777 --> 00:12:41,122
This is our one-way ticket out of the boonies!

222
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:43,196
No guts, no glory.

223
00:12:43,306 --> 00:12:45,301
Let this be your moment to shine.

224
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:46,376
Huh?

225
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,161
Man up.

226
00:12:47,438 --> 00:12:49,243
Go make a name for yourself, huh?

227
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:54,057
Best of luck. Try not to blow it...

228
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,052
You hear about Nagisa?

229
00:12:56,265 --> 00:12:57,935
They're chuckin' him to E-Class.

230
00:12:58,228 --> 00:13:00,969
Heh. Shocking. What else were they gonna do?

231
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:03,751
That's one less name in my contacts, I'll tell you that.

232
00:13:03,887 --> 00:13:07,024
Yeah. How messed up is it that
we even know someone like him?

233
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:17,544
Hello there! I'm back!

234
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:22,168
Okay, hi, sir. So, what... what's with the missile?

235
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:25,923
A souvenir from a strike force that
tried to bring me down over the Sea of Japan.

236
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:29,190
Must be lonely spending your life in the crosshairs.

237
00:13:29,394 --> 00:13:31,144
Quite the opposite, actually!

238
00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:33,799
Reminds me of how amazing I am!

239
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:37,349
Now, then. Inside for fifth period, please.

240
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:42,578
Sure...

241
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:45,144
There's no denying it.

242
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:49,203
He is amazing. Confident. Capable.

243
00:13:49,643 --> 00:13:52,603
Powerful enough to make people stand up and take notice.

244
00:13:52,886 --> 00:13:54,581
Even if they are trying to kill him.

245
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,656
Everything I'm not.

246
00:13:57,184 --> 00:14:00,674
Everything I'll never be, no matter how hard I try,

247
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:02,586
or how many chances I'm given.

248
00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:11,592
Because of you, I received the worst teacher's
evaluation of my career, you un-teachable brat.

249
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,622
Far as I'm concerned, this
campus can't eject you fast enough.

250
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:22,595
I can do this. I have an advantage.

251
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,829
I'm as invisible to him as I am to everyone else.

252
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:37,461
Okie-dokie!

253
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:41,186
Your assignment this afternoon is to compose a short poem.

254
00:14:41,603 --> 00:14:45,061
The final line should read "was tentacles all along".

255
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,431
What?

256
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:48,711
Excuse me, sir. Really?

257
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:49,552
Really!

258
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:52,722
When you've completed the
assignment, kindly bring it forward.

259
00:14:52,896 --> 00:14:55,479
You will be graded on creativity, grammar,

260
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:57,894
and overall beauty of expression.

261
00:14:58,182 --> 00:14:59,402
Here's an example:

262
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:03,169
"Not the storm of garden's snow of flowers moving on,

263
00:15:03,462 --> 00:15:07,054
but sprouting there instead was tentacles all along."

264
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:10,002
Yeah, because that makes a whole lot of sense.

265
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:10,639
Sheesh.

266
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:12,314
You may go home once you're finished.

267
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:14,018
What? But, sir!

268
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:15,518
"Was tentacles all along?"

269
00:15:15,543 --> 00:15:19,433
Should get those little synapses
sparking and the imagination slithering!

270
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:23,185
Could you please knock that off?!

271
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,073
Um, sir? Question!

272
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,639
Huh? Of course!

273
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,935
Fire away, Kayano!

274
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,863
Do we always have to call you sir?

275
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,210
You haven't given us your name and I think we need one.

276
00:15:32,524 --> 00:15:35,548
I mean, it'd be kinda awkward if
we don't call you anything, right?

277
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:37,868
Ah. Well, now...

278
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:39,122
Oversight.

279
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:40,330
Yeah, a little bit.

280
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:41,568
Hmmm...

281
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:46,233
Trouble is, I don't have the sort of name you
just give to people. Why not pick one for me?

282
00:15:46,548 --> 00:15:47,947
What could go wrong?

283
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:50,419
Just focus on meter and syntax.

284
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:51,388
M'kay.

285
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:55,018
I'll take a short break while you take up your pens.

286
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:05,657
Ah! Seems the muse favors Nagisa.

287
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:15,558
Every day after lunch, without fail, he gets sleepy.

288
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:18,490
I can tell he checks out when his face turns pink.

289
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,867
Kayano's question threw him off, he seems distracted.

290
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:25,989
All signs point to this being the right moment.

291
00:16:29,603 --> 00:16:32,464
Prep-school flunkies know how to slip between the cracks.

292
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:33,997
It's what we do.

293
00:16:35,164 --> 00:16:38,779
Parents and teachers are always
yapping at us to "apply ourselves."

294
00:16:41,342 --> 00:16:42,738
Apply ourselves.

295
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:49,418
What did I say about thinking outside the box?

296
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,095
All right, then.

297
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,286
Here goes nothing.

298
00:16:58,293 --> 00:16:58,968
Hmph!

299
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:03,723
Ha! Yeah!

300
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:04,696
We did it!

301
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:05,712
Nagisa!

302
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:06,269
Yeah!

303
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:07,460
We're gonna be billionaires!

304
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:08,573
Sayonara!

305
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:09,185
You jerks!

306
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:10,226
What the hell have you done?!

307
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,210
Hah! Never saw a suicide bomber comin', did ya?

308
00:17:13,235 --> 00:17:14,064
Terasaka!

309
00:17:14,474 --> 00:17:16,042
What'd did you make Nagisa do?!

310
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:18,735
What? I'm sorry, you have a better idea?

311
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:22,752
I gave him a modified toy grenade
filled with those stupid BB's.

312
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:26,767
And a spoonful or two of gunpowder so
they'd scatter at a high enough speed.

313
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:30,042
Don't worry, it wasn't enough to kill anybody.

314
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:32,528
I'll pitch in on his medical bills.

315
00:17:32,983 --> 00:17:33,535
Huh?

316
00:17:35,502 --> 00:17:38,049
Whoa. He doesn't even have a mark on him.

317
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,440
And, what the hell is this membrane?

318
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:41,617
Did the body, like...

319
00:17:41,642 --> 00:17:43,244
It's not a body, it's a husk.

320
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:45,239
I shed my skin once a month.

321
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:49,173
I wrapped it around your classmate
to protect him from the blast.

322
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,727
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and assume you didn't see this coming.

323
00:17:58,252 --> 00:18:02,019
Terasaka. Yoshida. Muramatsu.

324
00:18:03,978 --> 00:18:07,206
Okay, that's a face we haven't seen before.

325
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:15,651
Pitch black must mean pissed.

326
00:18:16,124 --> 00:18:19,460
This was your doing. Wasn't it?!

327
00:18:19,543 --> 00:18:20,585
Who? Us?

328
00:18:20,777 --> 00:18:22,030
It was all Nagisa!

329
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:29,585
Huh?!

330
00:18:34,168 --> 00:18:35,927
The nameplate off my house!

331
00:18:36,261 --> 00:18:37,818
Here's the deal, kiddos.

332
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:41,480
The agreement I have with your
government forbids me from harming you.

333
00:18:42,002 --> 00:18:43,991
But there's a catch.

334
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:48,155
If you pull another irresponsible stunt like that again...

335
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:52,334
There's nothing that says I can't harm someone else.

336
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:55,386
Family... Friends...

337
00:18:55,564 --> 00:18:59,332
Everyone in the world except for you, if I feel like it.

338
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:04,092
Suddenly it's clear how hard this is going to be.

339
00:19:04,864 --> 00:19:06,873
We can't run, we can't hide.

340
00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:09,868
Slipping between the cracks isn't an option.

341
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:13,506
The only way out...

342
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:14,953
is to kill him.

343
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:17,678
Go on! Threaten us!

344
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,047
I ain't afraid of no squid!

345
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:22,079
Where do you get off blowing up the moon?

346
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:25,202
We got rights, you know! Call us irresponsible!

347
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:27,060
We're just defending ourselves!

348
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:29,778
Of course. I know that.

349
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,782
I'm not calling you irresponsible for trying to kill me.

350
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,568
No, no, no.

351
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,763
As a matter of fact, Nagisa
here gets full marks for technique.

352
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:41,416
His composure was simply outstanding.

353
00:19:41,918 --> 00:19:42,800
However!

354
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,445
None of you cared if he was injured.

355
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:48,584
Not even Nagisa himself, it seems.

356
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:52,192
Students with that attitude
aren't fit to assassinate anyone.

357
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:55,940
You must believe yourself worthy of your target.

358
00:19:56,138 --> 00:20:00,605
That means taking pride in what
you do, in yourselves, and each other.

359
00:20:01,498 --> 00:20:04,824
All of you are more than the sum of your parts.

360
00:20:06,374 --> 00:20:07,930
Chewed out at Mach Twenty,

361
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,154
reassured by a tentacle wag.

362
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:12,323
It's a bizarre education.

363
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:15,381
But one I think is starting to grow on me.

364
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:18,599
I guess, when you spend your whole life being invisible,

365
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:22,406
well, it's something to feel like you're being seen.

366
00:20:22,725 --> 00:20:23,263
Heh.

367
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:31,923
If you...

368
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:35,586
If you could sacrifice a little bit of your time.

369
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,441
Give the children the tools they need to succeed.

370
00:20:40,877 --> 00:20:43,006
Such wonderful tentacles.

371
00:20:43,731 --> 00:20:45,962
With hands like these, you could reach them.

372
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:48,202
I know it in my heart.

373
00:20:50,934 --> 00:20:52,866
Here's a puzzler for you, Nagisa.

374
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,115
Given that I have no intention of being killed.

375
00:20:56,404 --> 00:21:01,581
Though, of course, I have every intention of enjoying
our time together before the planet goes kerplooie.

376
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:04,758
What, exactly, are you going to do about it?

377
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:08,524
That's the big question, isn't it?

378
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,927
It's not like we have a lot of experience
figuring out how to save the world.

379
00:21:13,978 --> 00:21:15,359
I have a feeling, though.

380
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:17,431
One way or another...

381
00:21:18,265 --> 00:21:20,028
we're gonna be fast learners.

382
00:21:21,043 --> 00:21:23,327
I think you'll find out I can do plenty, sir.

383
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,248
Just you wait and see.

384
00:21:27,928 --> 00:21:29,142
That's the spirit!

385
00:21:29,616 --> 00:21:31,637
No one leaves until I'm vanquished!

386
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:33,877
Way to go, Nagisa.

387
00:21:33,902 --> 00:21:35,132
This is totally balls!

388
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,152
Yep. We're assassins.

389
00:21:38,737 --> 00:21:39,440
Our target...

390
00:21:40,252 --> 00:21:41,168
is our teacher.

391
00:21:41,193 --> 00:21:42,033
Wipe it clean...

392
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:44,182
Man, I don't wanna be a killer.

393
00:21:44,207 --> 00:21:46,175
Ugh. We are so screwed.

394
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,440
We still don't know his name.

395
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:49,863
How do you say "un-killable" in Japanese?

396
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:50,505
Huh?

397
00:21:50,752 --> 00:21:52,993
Koro-sen-nai?

398
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:56,051
Koro-sen-say!

399
00:21:56,377 --> 00:21:57,602
"Koro Sensei?"

400
00:21:57,627 --> 00:21:58,198
Huh?

401
00:21:59,877 --> 00:22:00,923
That feels right.

402
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:03,893
Just us and Koro-sensei.

403
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:08,136
Here in our Assassination Classroom.
