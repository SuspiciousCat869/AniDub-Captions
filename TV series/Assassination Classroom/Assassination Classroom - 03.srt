1
00:00:01,722 --> 00:00:06,611
One! Two! Three! Four! Five!

2
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,399
Six! Seven! Eight!

3
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:13,815
The sounds of a choreographed exercise regimen
echoing across the fields on a golden afternoon.

4
00:00:14,397 --> 00:00:17,155
So peaceful. So militant.

5
00:00:17,828 --> 00:00:19,263
One! Two!

6
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:21,101
Make those knives sing.

7
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:23,230
Treat every move like a legit kill strike.

8
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,476
Seven! Eight! One!

9
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:29,784
You're in the way here, pal. Phys Ed is my department now.

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,043
But... But I'm lonely.

11
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:34,631
Find something else to do then, like, I don't know.

12
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:37,149
There's a sandbox. Have a field day.

13
00:00:38,595 --> 00:00:40,702
You don't have to be so insensitive...

14
00:00:40,853 --> 00:00:43,958
The kids liked it better when
I was their gym coach anyhow.

15
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:46,278
Yeah, not such much.

16
00:00:46,303 --> 00:00:49,091
No offense or anything, it's just
when it comes to exercise, you...

17
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:50,458
set the bar kinda high.

18
00:00:51,286 --> 00:00:54,930
All right, let's try a simple
jumping side-to-side maneuver.

19
00:00:55,184 --> 00:00:57,259
Watch closely and I'll show you how it's done.

20
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,235
Are you kidding me?!

21
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:03,106
Once you've got the rhythm, throw
some cat's-cradle into the mix.

22
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:05,060
Wow, he is seriously good!

23
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:07,276
Like we could keep up with that.

24
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:10,589
We're human beings, y'know. I, for
one, think our coach should be, too.

25
00:01:13,294 --> 00:01:15,388
Right. Back to work, people.

26
00:01:15,874 --> 00:01:17,598
Can I ask an obvious question, sir?

27
00:01:17,797 --> 00:01:23,357
If there's an actual point to this training, should,
uh, should we be practicing right in front of our target?

28
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:26,066
Whether killing or studying, it's the same principle.

29
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:28,704
Drill the basics and they'll serve you well.

30
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:29,730
Okay.

31
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:32,381
Isogai, Maehara, step up.

32
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:36,227
I want you to try to tag me with those knives.

33
00:01:36,252 --> 00:01:38,221
Wait. Like as a team?

34
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:39,906
Do you think that's a good idea?

35
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:43,055
The blades are harmless. They
weren't designed to injure human beings.

36
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,667
Tell you what, manage to hit me
and you can go home for the day.

37
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:50,805
Uh, okay. Well, here goes nothin'.

38
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:53,818
Come on.

39
00:01:57,936 --> 00:01:58,936
See that, kids?

40
00:01:59,116 --> 00:02:00,805
Even with the bare minimum know-how,

41
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,702
I can practically dodge their attacks in my sleep.

42
00:02:03,786 --> 00:02:04,994
They've got no technique.

43
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:06,919
Whoa...

44
00:02:12,077 --> 00:02:14,119
If you can't land a hit against a guy like me,

45
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,536
you haven't got a prayer against a
target whose top speed is Mach Twenty.

46
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:18,297
See?

47
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:21,180
We've been sparring for half a minute and look.

48
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:24,136
He's had time to change clothes, make tea,

49
00:02:24,216 --> 00:02:26,382
and build a model of Osaka Castle.

50
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:27,916
That is so irritating!

51
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,286
That's why we drill.

52
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:31,826
When the whole class can hit me, you have a shot.

53
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:34,674
Do what I tell you as often as I tell you to do it,

54
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:35,957
you'll become assassins.

55
00:02:36,844 --> 00:02:38,302
This isn't recess, kids.

56
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:40,869
From now on, gym class will be about the basics.

57
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,411
Stabbing correct use of firearms,
everything you need to succeed.

58
00:02:44,494 --> 00:02:45,626
Wow. Okay.

59
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:49,114
All right. That oughta do it for today.

60
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:50,831
Thank you, sir!

61
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,485
This is so intense!

62
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,469
He's terrifying but cool at the same time.

63
00:02:57,494 --> 00:02:58,409
I know!

64
00:02:58,776 --> 00:03:01,661
He wants you to hurt him but he'll
pat you on the head if you do it right.

65
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:02,898
He's a good coach.

66
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:04,631
I know what this is!

67
00:03:04,863 --> 00:03:08,011
You're trying to take my place as their favorite teacher!

68
00:03:08,374 --> 00:03:09,119
Really?

69
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:11,052
I'm here by assignment.

70
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:13,869
Like it or not, as per your contract, and I quote:

71
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,368
"all new hires regarding E Class are
solely the prerogative of Kunugigaoka Academy."

72
00:03:21,488 --> 00:03:24,771
And, either way, this is not a popularity contest.

73
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:28,267
It's my job. I'm here to help them kill you, pal.

74
00:03:28,536 --> 00:03:30,411
Could you not call me that, please?

75
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:32,763
I prefer the name my students gave me.

76
00:03:33,124 --> 00:03:35,426
So that's Koro-sensei to you.

77
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:40,494
Ugh. We've got a quiz in sixth period.

78
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:42,957
Right? They should just let us go home after gym.

79
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:47,643
Nagisa. 'Sup?

80
00:03:49,994 --> 00:03:51,102
It's been a while.

81
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,100
Karma... You're back?

82
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:57,854
Hm.

83
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:36,628
Oh, hey.

84
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:40,090
That must be the notorious Koro-sensei.

85
00:05:40,268 --> 00:05:43,062
Wow. He really does look like an octopus.

86
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:45,876
Ah. Mr. Akabane, correct?

87
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,552
I understand your suspension ends today.

88
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:52,009
Welcome back. That said, tardiness is a no-no.

89
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,386
It's kinda tricky gettin' back into the swing of things.

90
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,969
Oh. Feel free to call me by my first name.

91
00:05:59,052 --> 00:06:01,927
Anyway, I've heard some good
things, Teach. Nice to meet'cha.

92
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:03,077
The pleasure's all mine.

93
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,134
Should be a fun and educational year.

94
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:13,994
Ah. You are fast, aren't'cha?

95
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,267
And who'da thought these knives actually work?

96
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,478
I just cut one up into strips and tacked 'em on.

97
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,909
Pretty elementary stuff, chief.

98
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:27,833
I'm disappointed that's all it
took to catch you by surprise.

99
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:29,517
But good jump.

100
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:32,171
If you don't mind comin' off like a 'fraidy cat.

101
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:33,729
What, are you scared of me?

102
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:36,526
He hurt him. He actually hurt him.

103
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:38,932
That makes him the first.

104
00:06:39,494 --> 00:06:43,046
I heard they call you "Koro-sensei"
'cause you're s'posed to be unkillable.

105
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:45,367
Oh, come on.

106
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:48,433
No way you can be this big of a pushover!

107
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,614
Hey, Nagisa, what kind of person is this Karma guy?

108
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:58,390
Uh. He and I were in the same
class our first and second year.

109
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:03,632
He was violent, so violent they
finally expelled him, shipped him here.

110
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:07,176
E Class is where they send you when
they don't know what else to do with you.

111
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,261
Thing is, under the circumstances,

112
00:07:10,286 --> 00:07:12,062
he may end up a star student.

113
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:13,661
Huh? What do you mean?

114
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:16,639
Weapons and blood are his passion.

115
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:20,404
Trust me, if anyone can kill our teacher, it's Karma.

116
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,987
Stick around next time, Koro-sensei.

117
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:26,062
I'll show you what it's like to be assassinated.

118
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,212
You won't want to miss it.

119
00:07:39,505 --> 00:07:41,729
Um. What is he doing?

120
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:44,279
I dunno, I think he's punching the wall.

121
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:45,612
No, you're right.

122
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:48,738
Karma's smack-talk seems to have really touched a nerve.

123
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,900
But what's the point of punchin' a wall when
his tentacles are too soft to do any damage?

124
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:57,498
Okay, that's enough! Could you maybe stop that?!

125
00:07:57,661 --> 00:07:59,208
We're trying to take a quiz here!

126
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:00,969
S-Sorry! Yes, absolutely.

127
00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:03,360
You sure you know what you're
gettin' yourself into, Karma?

128
00:08:03,385 --> 00:08:05,827
The jellyfish is sincerely pissed off at you.

129
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:08,161
You can't pay me enough to be in your shoes.

130
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:11,212
If I was you, I'd stay at home
with my head under a pillow.

131
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:15,589
'Course he's pissed. Who wouldn't be
if someone made an attempt on their life?

132
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:19,818
'Less the would-be assassin screwed
up and pissed himself in the process.

133
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,719
I didn't piss myself!

134
00:08:21,744 --> 00:08:23,312
That attitude's gonna get your ass kicked...

135
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,494
Quiet, please!

136
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:26,094
No noise during a quiz!

137
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:27,184
Tell that to your tentacles.

138
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:29,303
Continue to talk, and I will assume that you're cheating!

139
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:31,286
Sorry, Koro-sensei, my bad.

140
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:33,219
No worries, though. I've already finished.

141
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:35,469
I'm just gonna eat this gelato if that's okay.

142
00:08:35,494 --> 00:08:37,939
Not so fast! No eating in class!

143
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:40,792
Hey!

144
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:43,801
That's the gelato I brought back from Italy yesterday!

145
00:08:43,826 --> 00:08:44,788
Uh-oh.

146
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:46,438
Huh? Sorry.

147
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:49,344
My bad, I just saw it chillin' in the faculty lounge.

148
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:50,802
This won't do, young man!

149
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:54,719
I flew through the coldest layer of the
stratosphere to keep that delicious treat from melting!

150
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:57,565
Yeah? So? Whaddya gonna do?

151
00:08:58,885 --> 00:08:59,719
Hit me?

152
00:08:59,744 --> 00:09:00,716
Of course not!

153
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:04,172
I'll simply have it back and finish
what's left, thank you very much.

154
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:08,108
Anti-me BB's?!

155
00:09:10,808 --> 00:09:13,032
Wow. That's twice in one day, Teach.

156
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,528
I'm gonna keep pullin' the same old tricks.

157
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:20,205
Class'll get interrupted, our grades'll slip.

158
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:23,208
Let's be straight-up, though. If you want this to stop,

159
00:09:23,244 --> 00:09:27,348
you can just kill me or anyone
else in this class for that matter.

160
00:09:27,753 --> 00:09:30,932
You just gotta let go of wanting
us to see you as our teacher.

161
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,294
Give us a taste of your ugly side.

162
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:38,636
Or you can make peace with all this.

163
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:40,894
Accept that I'll be the one to kill you.

164
00:09:42,117 --> 00:09:44,431
Here's my quiz. Easy peesy.

165
00:09:46,438 --> 00:09:48,154
Peace out for now, Teach.

166
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:50,413
Whaddya say we play again tomorrow?

167
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:53,469
Karma's not afraid to go there,

168
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:55,609
he knows exactly what buttons to push.

169
00:09:56,618 --> 00:09:57,587
Case in point.

170
00:09:57,786 --> 00:10:02,473
He drew a line in the sand Koro-sensei couldn't
cross without changing the way we all saw him.

171
00:10:02,892 --> 00:10:03,901
It took nerve.

172
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:06,993
It also took honing in on his target's weakness.

173
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:12,355
He's clever. He's manipulative. He's ice cold.

174
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:15,543
He sees what makes you tick and how to exploit it.

175
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:18,602
If anyone can do this, it's him.

176
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:23,044
That boy...

177
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,650
He's left me with no choice but to go buy another gelato.

178
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,837
He's sharp. Deviously clever. Mustn't let him bait me.

179
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:34,369
Mustn't give him the satisfaction
of losing my temper and killing him.

180
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:36,771
I am the teacher, he is the student.

181
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:38,703
Yes, indeed.

182
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:41,174
I'll have to be exceptionally careful with that one.

183
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,018
See ya later, Nagisa.

184
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:48,411
Bye! Have a good one!

185
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,375
Are you kiddin' me? Is that actually Nagisa?

186
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:55,636
Look at the guy all cozy with the E Class dumbasses.

187
00:10:55,661 --> 00:11:00,503
Ew, gross. Gotta hand it to him, he's adapted to
the crowd he's gonna spend the rest of his life with.

188
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:05,538
Hey, did you hear the news? Now that his suspension's
over, they shoved that Akabane nut over to E Class.

189
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:07,128
Ooh! Dude! No kidding?

190
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:10,496
I'd rather be dead than stuck
in a classroom with that freak!

191
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:14,415
Seriously? Because I can help you out with that.

192
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,469
It'd be messy, but real quick.

193
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:20,045
I'd rather live, thanks! Run away!

194
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:22,399
Like I'd actually do anything, right?

195
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:28,001
I'm not gonna risk another suspension with the
once-in-a-lifetime deal they're giving me in E Class.

196
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:29,971
Uh, hey.

197
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:31,592
Yeah, hey, Nagisa.

198
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,070
Is it cool if I pick your brain for a sec?

199
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,212
Word is that you've been keepin' notes on the octopus.

200
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:40,742
Um, well. Yeah, I kinda have.

201
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:42,469
Does he hate that nickname?

202
00:11:42,517 --> 00:11:44,267
Us callin' him "octopus," I mean?

203
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:45,670
Now that you mention it.

204
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:49,038
Whenever he draws himself, it's always as an octopus,

205
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:52,334
and that's the skin he picks for
his characters in every video game.

206
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:55,655
And there's this thing he does in the sandbox.

207
00:11:56,221 --> 00:11:57,202
Octopus trap.

208
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:59,552
So, no, I don't think he minds at all.

209
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,952
In fact, I think it's like his personal
avatar or whatever, y'know? He loves it.

210
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:05,110
Does he?

211
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:06,969
That's good.

212
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:08,981
Oh, this is gonna be friggin' epic.

213
00:12:09,585 --> 00:12:10,632
I know that look.

214
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:12,896
You're cooking up something really dark.

215
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:16,106
I might be. It's fun, right?

216
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:19,427
I was into this when I thought he was just a monster,

217
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:22,869
but... now that I know what his personality is like.

218
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:28,222
I finally get to kill an honest-to-goodness teacher!

219
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:31,765
I've been dreaming of this.

220
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:34,331
Ever since my last teacher up and died.

221
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:47,297
My gelato funds...

222
00:12:47,511 --> 00:12:50,467
Gone, pinched right out from under my nose.

223
00:12:50,722 --> 00:12:52,970
And with payday an eternity away!

224
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,218
Guess I'll have to make my own now.

225
00:12:58,388 --> 00:13:00,263
Good morning, boys and girls!

226
00:13:03,665 --> 00:13:06,011
Uh? Why the long faces?

227
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:06,827
Has something...

228
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,661
Oops! That's on me.

229
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:13,036
Yeah, totally thought it was you, innocent mistake.

230
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,677
I stabbed it, so I s'pose I should get rid of it?

231
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:18,300
Yes, you should.

232
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:21,588
Bring it on, Koro-sensei.

233
00:13:22,624 --> 00:13:25,641
No worries, I don't plan on killin' you physically, yet.

234
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:28,945
It's more fun to watch your spirit die first.

235
00:13:34,702 --> 00:13:37,073
Observe, if you will, Karma m'boy,

236
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:39,327
the versatility of these tentacles,

237
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:43,016
and the firepower of this missile
yoinked from the Self Defense Force!

238
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:49,039
If you think I'm gonna let the new
kid get away with murder, think again.

239
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:54,244
Don't you know breakfast is the
most important meal of the day?

240
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,344
Your complexion tells me you haven't eaten.

241
00:13:56,451 --> 00:13:59,677
So, please, help yourself to
some of this delicious takoyaki,

242
00:13:59,702 --> 00:14:00,836
I insist.

243
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:02,964
You see...

244
00:14:03,286 --> 00:14:04,244
I'm a giver...

245
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:05,508
I take care of things.

246
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:08,932
Hungry students, would-be assassins, troubled teens.

247
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:13,302
Every attempt on my life is an
opportunity for me to play my part.

248
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:15,313
So, by all means, keep at it.

249
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,952
By the end of the day, if your body and
mind aren't aglow with health and knowledge,

250
00:14:22,036 --> 00:14:23,654
I haven't done my job.

251
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:27,802
As you can see,

252
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:30,002
whatever we do, this number remains.

253
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,344
Now, I know the concept of indivisibility is a beast.

254
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:37,399
But, if its fangs frighten you, I
have a surefire method for taming it.

255
00:14:37,718 --> 00:14:40,386
See if you can get the gist
as I write it out on the board.

256
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:42,491
Karma.

257
00:14:42,692 --> 00:14:45,860
I'm afraid the speed of your
draw leaves something to be desired.

258
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:48,950
I had time on my hands.

259
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:51,580
Hope you don't mind if I prettified yours.

260
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:56,791
Let's see now.

261
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,779
How'd the two of you do, Fuwa?

262
00:14:59,219 --> 00:15:01,219
I'm... not totally sure.

263
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:04,037
It's got a bizarre tangy flavor to it for some reason.

264
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:05,253
Let's give it a taste.

265
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:07,927
Probably easier if you just start over from scratch.

266
00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:09,281
Why not toss it out?

267
00:15:09,862 --> 00:15:12,164
We wear an apron in Home Ec, Karma.

268
00:15:13,082 --> 00:15:15,344
Oh, and don't worry: the soup is fine.

269
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:18,402
I siphoned it out of thin air and put it back in the pot.

270
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:20,936
I also added a dash of sugar.

271
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,100
That's exactly what it needed!

272
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:25,822
Cute outfit.

273
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:28,945
It's no use.

274
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,119
"Over that little pool..."

275
00:15:30,202 --> 00:15:32,067
Koro-sensei has weaknesses.

276
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:32,909
We all do.

277
00:15:33,755 --> 00:15:35,450
He screws up every now and then,

278
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:38,883
and his speed drops to human
levels whenever he's flustered, sure.

279
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:39,760
But...

280
00:15:40,062 --> 00:15:42,890
Karma's been so relentless with his surprise attacks.

281
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:51,236
"Even as I was thinking this, the red frog,
having failed again, was making its way back."

282
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:53,209
I was starting to get bored with it...

283
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:55,450
He has Koro-sensei on high alert.

284
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,439
And that means... No dice...

285
00:16:07,513 --> 00:16:09,786
C'mon, man. I'm tellin ya not to sweat it.

286
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:11,524
We'll do it together as a group.

287
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:15,754
You could have the sneakiest, most
foolproof plan in the world ready to go,

288
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:20,280
but if Koro-sensei's got his eye on you,
Forget it. He's not like other teachers.

289
00:16:20,744 --> 00:16:22,264
Other teachers, huh?

290
00:16:22,803 --> 00:16:23,448
No.

291
00:16:23,788 --> 00:16:25,751
I'm with you a hundred percent, Akabane.

292
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:27,786
Yes, you've had problems.

293
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:30,059
Yes, you have issues respecting authority.

294
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:32,132
But you're absolutely in the right.

295
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:34,873
Not a question. And I stand by you.

296
00:16:35,436 --> 00:16:36,023
Hm.

297
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,065
You don't understand.

298
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,161
I wanna do it on my own.

299
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:43,293
Let me ask you, would it tick
you off to die in some random place?

300
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:45,217
Oh, Karma?

301
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,336
I feel like I've taken
exceptionally good care of you today.

302
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:55,219
Keep trying to kill me if that tickles your fancy.

303
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,079
I certainly don't get tired of spiffing you up.

304
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:02,181
Just so we're on the same page here.

305
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:05,667
You pretty much consider
yourself a teacher above all else?

306
00:17:06,314 --> 00:17:07,227
That's right.

307
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:08,108
Cool.

308
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:12,944
And you wouldn't think twice about putting
your life on the line to save a student?

309
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,797
What sort of teacher would I be if I did?

310
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:18,584
That's awesome. Good to know.

311
00:17:19,327 --> 00:17:21,119
So I can kill you.

312
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,973
Knew there had to be a way.

313
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,199
What's it gonna be, Teach?

314
00:17:29,693 --> 00:17:32,783
You gonna swoop down to save me
and get blasted in the process?

315
00:17:33,248 --> 00:17:36,326
Or you gonna be the sort of
teacher who lets one of your kids die?

316
00:17:37,577 --> 00:17:42,444
Ha, ha! Whoa! That crap they say about
your life flashing before your eyes is true!

317
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:44,859
I think he's learned his lesson.

318
00:17:45,286 --> 00:17:48,196
Three-E? The one out in the sticks?

319
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:49,753
Dude, that sucks.

320
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:52,010
Still, don't let anyone give you lip over it.

321
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,907
What?

322
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,831
I'm not the bad guy here.

323
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:57,011
All I did was put a bully in his place.

324
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:58,263
Little jerk had it comin'.

325
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,636
No! Damn it, Akabane!

326
00:18:00,717 --> 00:18:03,156
Any way you slice it, you're clearly in the wrong!

327
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:05,702
Are you out of your mind, or just stupid?!

328
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:11,093
What possessed you to think attacking your class's
star pupil like a mad dog was something I'd let slide?

329
00:18:11,302 --> 00:18:13,219
But... Sir, he was...

330
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:15,427
What? Talking badly about the dregs?!

331
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:17,617
Good for you, injuring someone on principle!

332
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:19,786
This young man happens to have a future!

333
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,662
If this interferes with his exams, it's on my head!

334
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,546
He said he'd stand by me.

335
00:18:26,684 --> 00:18:28,446
So much for that, I guess...

336
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:30,726
Damn.

337
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:32,249
I'm totally gonna die.

338
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:35,613
I've been willing to turn a
blind eye on account of your grades.

339
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,119
But you've tried my patience once too often.

340
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:40,969
Throw a monkey wrench into my career and all bets are off.

341
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:42,761
I'm not saving you anymore.

342
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:46,789
This is it. This is how it's gonna go down.

343
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:50,850
The good news is I filed the paperwork
for your transfer just this afternoon.

344
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:52,827
Best thing for all involved, really.

345
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:56,443
But the bad news is, you'll be
commencing Third Year in E Class.

346
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:00,209
Son of a bitch screwed me over.

347
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:04,523
So that's it. He's dead to me now.

348
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:08,244
What are you waitin' for, Koro-sensei?

349
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:09,203
Let's do this!

350
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:12,545
You either die for real, or I kill your reputation.

351
00:19:17,776 --> 00:19:18,935
Well done!

352
00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:22,327
A splendidly premeditated assassination attempt!

353
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:24,432
Full marks! Neat, huh?

354
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:28,197
I knew your body couldn't take being
plucked out of free-fall at the speed of sound,

355
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:30,654
and had I moved any slower, you would've shot me.

356
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:34,219
What a tangled and sticky web we weave, eh?

357
00:19:34,244 --> 00:19:35,104
What the hell?!

358
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:37,335
Is there anything these tentacles aren't capable of?!

359
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:38,876
Can't shoot me now, can you?

360
00:19:41,591 --> 00:19:43,533
Oh, and for future reference:

361
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:46,282
Students do not die on my watch.

362
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:47,258
Ever.

363
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:50,577
Take that to heart for the next time you jump.

364
00:19:58,007 --> 00:20:00,623
I got nothin'. Un-friggin'-believable.

365
00:20:01,573 --> 00:20:05,004
He won't die. The teacher in him especially.

366
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,124
I don't get it. How were you so calm the whole time?

367
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,157
Meh. No big.

368
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:14,927
What really sucks is that was my best bet.

369
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:17,527
Nothing else I can come up with even touches it.

370
00:20:17,802 --> 00:20:20,310
Aw! Run out of ideas already?

371
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,568
But I have an entire beauty regimen lined up just for you!

372
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:26,969
"C'mon. No way you can be this big of a pushover!"

373
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:29,398
I still feel like killing something.

374
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,990
Except... it's different this time, somehow.

375
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,922
No worries, Teach. You're still dead meat.

376
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,670
That's the spirit! Never give up!

377
00:20:39,094 --> 00:20:41,991
Seems my tender loving care has paid off.

378
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:43,365
Hm.

379
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,929
Welp. Let's head back, Nagisa.

380
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,166
We can grab some food on the way.

381
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:51,636
Excuse me! That's my purse!

382
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:52,534
Come on, teach.

383
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:55,494
You've gotta stop leaving stuff
unattended in the faculty lounge.

384
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:56,677
Give it back!

385
00:20:56,702 --> 00:20:57,579
Here you go.

386
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,319
Gimme-gimme-gimme!

387
00:21:00,156 --> 00:21:02,592
Uh, hey, uh, this is, uh, empty!

388
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:04,856
There wasn't much there to begin with.

389
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:06,151
Call it a donation.

390
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:12,635
A donation? A donation?!

391
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,164
Every time one of us goes in for the kill, we
miss the mark, but somehow end up better off.

392
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:20,635
That's the way it goes in our Assassination Classroom.

393
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:24,036
I can't wait to see how we try
to kill our teacher tomorrow.
