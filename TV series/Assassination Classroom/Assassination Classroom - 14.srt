1
00:00:02,532 --> 00:00:02,936
Phew!

2
00:00:03,071 --> 00:00:05,623
Talk about Helter Swelter, am I right, boys and girls?

3
00:00:05,698 --> 00:00:07,066
Quite a heat wave we've got!

4
00:00:07,819 --> 00:00:08,439
Yeah.

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,554
Hey, so why are we hiking down the mountain again?

6
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:14,547
To swim, maybe? The main campus has a pool.

7
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,866
In the opposite direction.

8
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:17,567
Yeah.

9
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:21,101
Hey, Nagisa.

10
00:00:21,404 --> 00:00:23,374
I heard you were a real badass the other day.

11
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:26,782
Sorry I wasn't around. I'd
have loved to see the guy's face.

12
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,377
He means my "assassination" of
Coach Takaeko. Which was cool, sure.

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,762
But it's relatively easy to
take a normal person by surprise.

14
00:00:36,283 --> 00:00:37,915
Besides, we're down to the wire,

15
00:00:38,282 --> 00:00:41,204
and it's still anybody's guess
how we're going to assassinate him.

16
00:00:44,894 --> 00:00:47,520
All right, class. Feast your eyes on this.

17
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:54,359
Your very own swimming hole,

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,073
compliments of moi!

19
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:57,609
Woohoo!

20
00:01:01,073 --> 00:01:03,331
It's weird when he does stuff like this.

21
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:05,069
It makes him awesome,

22
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,549
and, honestly, hard to wanna kill.

23
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:16,157
Not to be ungrateful, but this is kinda sad.

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,115
First of all, I can't even swim, and second of
all, this bathing suit makes me feel self-conscious.

25
00:01:21,198 --> 00:01:22,782
You got nothin' to worry about, babe.

26
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:25,854
Take my word for it. Plenty
of people go for your body type.

27
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:27,576
Gee, thanks.

28
00:01:27,907 --> 00:01:31,311
And plenty of people wouldn't find it
creepy that you're using a long-range lens.

29
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,711
Nagisa? Oh, snap.

30
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,532
You're really a dude!

31
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:36,532
You didn't know that?

32
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:37,882
We had our doubts.

33
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,027
Kimura!

34
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,863
Absolutely no running around the edge of the pool!

35
00:01:42,907 --> 00:01:44,365
That's how accidents happen!

36
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,849
Oh, sorry.

37
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:50,379
What do think you two are doing?!

38
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:52,485
Absolutely no holding your breath underwater!

39
00:01:52,573 --> 00:01:54,365
How am I supposed to tell the difference between horseplay

40
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,115
and drowning?

41
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,259
Absolutely no sneaking pictures!

42
00:01:57,903 --> 00:02:00,706
Put down that book and enjoy the water, for heaven's sake!

43
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:04,822
Wow. What a pain.

44
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,784
Huh.

45
00:02:05,854 --> 00:02:08,413
I guess being a lifeguard
really goes to some people's heads.

46
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:10,773
Brings out their inner Type-A personality.

47
00:02:10,832 --> 00:02:11,623
No kidding.

48
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:14,555
Someone tell him he needs to dial it back a notch.

49
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,282
I've gone through a great deal of
trouble making sure this pool is in harmony

50
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:20,782
with its natural surroundings.

51
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:23,826
Proper enjoyment of it must be disciplined and orderly.

52
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:27,191
Aw, c'mon! Don't be such a stick in the mud!

53
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:28,282
You need to loosen up!

54
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:29,055
Eek!

55
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:31,437
Uhh...

56
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,075
Um, did he just scream like a chick?

57
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:36,299
Karma, what are you doing?

58
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,612
Stop it! I'll fall in! Are you listening to me?

59
00:02:38,657 --> 00:02:40,692
I said stop! Please!

60
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:42,592
Whoa.

61
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:44,237
Are you okay?

62
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:45,629
Don't read too much into it.

63
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:47,939
I just don't feel like taking
a dip at the moment, that's all.

64
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:48,896
It's certainly not as though

65
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:51,366
water causes my fingers to swell up or anything.

66
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:52,668
Wait a sec.

67
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:54,805
He can't swim!

68
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,531
Interesting. This might be
his most promising weakness yet.

69
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:01,844
If you were never intending to get in the pool,

70
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,942
why even bother bringing that kickboard along?

71
00:03:04,032 --> 00:03:05,800
This? This isn't a kickboard!

72
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:07,240
It's my afternoon snack!

73
00:03:07,323 --> 00:03:08,087
Naturally.

74
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:13,935
Hmph.

75
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:53,611
Excuse me? You're happy your grades are up?

76
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:57,091
No, say that again! Don't think I heard you right!

77
00:04:57,575 --> 00:05:00,086
C'mon, these are the highest scores I've ever got.

78
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:01,509
It's 'cause of the octopus

79
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:03,180
and the "Right Before the Practice Exam

80
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:05,377
Afterschool Slithery Study Session" thing.

81
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:06,586
Whoa, whoa.

82
00:05:06,612 --> 00:05:08,826
You sayin' you actually showed up for that crap?!

83
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:09,541
Yeah.

84
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:12,778
The three of us agreed no slithery anything, remember?!

85
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:13,965
But that's the thing!

86
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:16,499
It wasn't all bad, in fact, it really helped me out.

87
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:17,835
Are you kidding me?!

88
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:22,013
Fine, care about your grades if
that gets you off, you traitor.

89
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,722
Fantastic.

90
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:28,139
Now Muramatsu's fallen for that "you can do it" B.S.

91
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:31,890
Am I the only one with half a brain?

92
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:35,226
That is awesome!

93
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:38,298
Holy crap, you even got the flair sides right!

94
00:05:38,323 --> 00:05:40,090
The hell you so stoked about?

95
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:41,446
Oh. Hey, Terasaka.

96
00:05:41,832 --> 00:05:43,165
So, you know how we always thought

97
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,419
I was the only one here into bikes and stuff?

98
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:48,501
Well, turns out Koro-sensei
knows as much as I do about 'em.

99
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:49,606
I may be an adult,

100
00:05:49,673 --> 00:05:51,830
but I'll never outgrow the need for speed.

101
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:55,112
I've dabbled in manly hobbies like this for years.

102
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:58,983
Did you know this particular model
can reach up to 300 kilometers per hour?

103
00:05:59,115 --> 00:06:02,335
What I wouldn't give to burn
rubber on the genuine article someday.

104
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:03,367
Are you kidding?

105
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:06,163
You could get this puppy to
Mach 20 without pumpin' the gas!

106
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:13,680
Come on dude, what the hell is wrong with you?

107
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:15,156
Apologize immediately!

108
00:06:15,285 --> 00:06:17,743
Koro-sensei worked very hard
on that to showcase his manliness

109
00:06:17,907 --> 00:06:19,215
and you've just reduced him to tears!

110
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,323
Yeah, what she said!

111
00:06:20,407 --> 00:06:23,998
You're talkin' to me and all I
hear is a swarm of freakin' locusts.

112
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:25,963
It's time for some pest control!

113
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:28,167
Hey! What the...

114
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:28,965
Is that a bug bomb?

115
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,808
That does it!

116
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:31,390
I enjoy a good prank as much as the next...

117
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:33,604
Get those disgusting things the hell off.

118
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:36,882
You're a monster, you hear me? A freak of nature!

119
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,573
Anyone who falls for your nice-guy act is stupid!

120
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:40,493
That's right!

121
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,118
I don't know what's got your jock in a tangle today,

122
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,827
but if he's such a monster, why not man-up and kill him?

123
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:50,831
I mean, last I checked that is
what we're supposed to do here.

124
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:53,365
You aimin' to start something with me, tough guy?

125
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:56,573
'Cause I wanted to bash your stupid
head in since the moment you w...

126
00:06:56,657 --> 00:06:58,793
A little advice. You got this backwards.

127
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:02,280
You gotta bash my head in before you can run your mouth.

128
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,290
Let go!

129
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:06,737
You're all a bunch of freaks!

130
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,625
Wow. What crawled up his butt?

131
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,116
I dunno, maybe he just does it for the attention.

132
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:12,965
Hmm.

133
00:07:17,444 --> 00:07:18,645
Earth on the brink.

134
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:20,735
Students training to be assassins

135
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,158
like we're in some kinda self-improvement camp.

136
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,243
Give me one good reason why I
should care about any of this.

137
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,063
I'm not gonna just smile and fall in line with the herd.

138
00:07:31,257 --> 00:07:32,965
I do things my way.

139
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:34,184
Nicely done.

140
00:07:34,646 --> 00:07:36,069
Here. You've earned it.

141
00:07:37,365 --> 00:07:39,798
Phase One of my plan is complete.

142
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,190
Now these guys have the right idea.

143
00:07:44,407 --> 00:07:46,731
The octopus has an excellent sense of smell.

144
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:50,705
Hence why we dare not lay the
groundwork for Itona's return ourselves.

145
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:54,937
Had he picked up even a trace of our
scent, the game would've been spoiled.

146
00:07:55,657 --> 00:07:59,625
I sympathize with your feelings on
the matter, Ryoma Terasaka, believe me.

147
00:08:00,015 --> 00:08:01,585
And I advise you to relax.

148
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:03,789
You have but to follow my plan to the letter.

149
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:06,577
The freak of nature will be dead,

150
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:10,256
and E Class restored to its former insignificance.

151
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:11,414
Hm?

152
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:12,726
I know you.

153
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:15,698
You're weaker than the red-headed one by far.

154
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:18,956
Your physique says otherwise, but I see.

155
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:20,775
Those eyes are a dead giveaway.

156
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:23,850
You have sight, but no vision.

157
00:08:24,444 --> 00:08:27,440
The only thing you see is the path of least resistance.

158
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,308
The wolf has eyes for prey. The cow has eyes for hay.

159
00:08:31,609 --> 00:08:34,622
One of them's a killer, the other his buffet.

160
00:08:35,157 --> 00:08:36,407
What the hell is that supposed to mean?!

161
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,172
There, there.

162
00:08:37,575 --> 00:08:40,048
Calm yourself. We're counting on you tomorrow.

163
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:51,180
Okay, could you please stop?

164
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,657
This crying business is ridiculous.

165
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:53,299
'Scuse me.

166
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:55,850
For your information, these are my nostrils.

167
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:58,490
I'm not crying, my nose is running.

168
00:08:58,573 --> 00:08:59,990
How am I supposed to know that?!

169
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:03,779
For some reason, my sinuses have
been running amok since yesterday.

170
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:06,354
Terasaka, thank heaven!

171
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:09,763
I had this awful feeling you abandoned our class for good!

172
00:09:11,824 --> 00:09:18,532
The so-called "bug bomb" you set off in class was in
fact a canister of concentrated, pollen-like allergens,

173
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:21,658
specially designed to blunt our foe's senses.

174
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,740
Now we move to Phase Two.

175
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,583
So, octopus.

176
00:09:25,618 --> 00:09:27,292
I think it's time we stopped messin' around

177
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,440
and killed you for real.

178
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:30,214
Come by the pool after class.

179
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:33,734
We all know you're big weakness is water, don't we now?

180
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:34,782
Hey, 's all right.

181
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:35,990
You guys can come, too!

182
00:09:36,298 --> 00:09:37,801
You can watch while I shove him in!

183
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,103
You can even help me out!

184
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:40,878
Where's this coming from?

185
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:44,698
You always make fun of our attempts and
now you expect us to be on board with yours?

186
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:48,034
Dude, you pride yourself on having
the worst attitude in this class.

187
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:50,591
Give me one good reason why any of us should help you.

188
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,476
Ha. Whatever. Suit yourself, man.

189
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:57,090
I didn't want to share the prize
money with you dead-asses anyway.

190
00:09:57,782 --> 00:09:59,282
The hell is his deal all of a sudden?

191
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,604
The guy's mood swings are too much for me.

192
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,399
Exactly. Count me out.

193
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,655
Yeah, me too.

194
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,688
Let's all go! It'll be fun!

195
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,573
What the... His snot's hardening
and locking us to the floor!

196
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:11,532
Terasaka's finally showing some initiative.

197
00:10:11,615 --> 00:10:12,865
We have to be supportive!

198
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:14,698
I realize he's been rather difficult in the past,

199
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,985
but this is everyone's chance to kill and make up!

200
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,971
Why are you so gross?

201
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:20,566
Terasaka, hold up!

202
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:21,115
Huh?

203
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:23,043
Are you for real about this, or what?

204
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:25,812
You tell me, man. Does it look like I'm joking?

205
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:30,109
I'm just sayin'. If you've got a plan, let
the rest of us in on it and we might be able...

206
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:31,220
Shut up!

207
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,557
Damn! You people make me sick, you know that?

208
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:36,695
Always huddling together,
terrified to make a move on your own.

209
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,875
I ain't like the rest of you, I have vision!

210
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,860
A wolf's got eyes for prey, a cow's got eyes for hay!

211
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:46,738
All right, then. Guess he knows what he's doing.

212
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,452
Still, it seems like he's more confident in his plan

213
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:51,560
than in himself.

214
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:56,327
I mean, "the wolf's got eyes for prey"? Seriously?

215
00:10:56,694 --> 00:10:58,718
No way he came up with that on his own.

216
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,976
Yeah, there we go!

217
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:05,224
Everybody stay spread out like that! Nice and far apart!

218
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:06,448
Yeah, we get it. Thanks.

219
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,448
I'm not so sure about this plan of yours.

220
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:11,073
It's highly unlikely we'll get Koro-sensei in the water...

221
00:11:11,157 --> 00:11:14,410
How unlikely is it that I get
you in the water against your will?

222
00:11:14,865 --> 00:11:17,740
Look at 'im. We cooperate and the jerk goes power mad.

223
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:21,282
Yeah. Sorta reminds me of the way he used
to push people around back in Second Year.

224
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:22,307
Ah-ha.

225
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:27,074
So I assume the idea is to push me in the water
and have everyone converge on me with their knives?

226
00:11:27,348 --> 00:11:29,181
Have you worked out how to actually push me in?

227
00:11:29,282 --> 00:11:33,199
It's only good sportsmanship to tell you
that fancy pistol of yours won't do the trick.

228
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,416
This is not a gun,

229
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:40,493
but rather a special transmitter that will
alert us to when all the pieces are in place.

230
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,321
Once your classmates are in position, pull the trigger.

231
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:44,727
We'll take it from there.

232
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:47,984
Best say your prayers, monster. This is it.

233
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:49,240
I'm ready when you are.

234
00:11:49,323 --> 00:11:51,233
My sinuses have even been cleared.

235
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,737
For the record I've always hated you with a passion.

236
00:11:53,957 --> 00:11:55,976
I couldn't wait for you to up and disappear.

237
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:57,602
Oh, I'm well aware.

238
00:11:57,638 --> 00:11:59,672
Methinks we should have a little sit-down after this.

239
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:01,030
Talk out our differences.

240
00:12:01,532 --> 00:12:03,924
This'll wipe that smile off his face.

241
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,457
Itona, you're up!

242
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:08,737
What?

243
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:10,071
Uh! Children!

244
00:12:11,934 --> 00:12:12,591
Help!

245
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:16,531
Surely you can't just leave these
poor young people to drown, can you?

246
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,013
What the hell, man? They never told me.

247
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:22,014
They never told me about this.

248
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:32,908
There's a waterfall up ahead.

249
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:34,599
If they go over it, they're doomed!

250
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,740
He can't rescue them without getting wet. and by the
time he saves them all, his fingers will be swollen.

251
00:12:41,281 --> 00:12:44,515
Normally he'd use his mucus as a
protective barrier against water.

252
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:46,063
Normally, yes.

253
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:48,989
In fact, his mucus can gelatinize water,

254
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:51,004
modifying the permeation pressure.

255
00:12:51,364 --> 00:12:53,817
But alas, his mucus stores have run dry.

256
00:12:58,489 --> 00:12:59,322
This can't be good.

257
00:12:59,374 --> 00:13:00,950
I-I didn't do it.

258
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,851
This wasn't part of the deal.

259
00:13:04,822 --> 00:13:07,664
Itona was just s'pposed to
help me push him in, that was all.

260
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:09,801
You never had a plan, did you?

261
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,239
Just let yourself be strung along by someone else.

262
00:13:12,322 --> 00:13:14,406
A pawn in a game you don't know the rules to.

263
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:16,906
Uh! Listen to me, damn it! It's not my fault!

264
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:19,489
Come on, you know I'd never
sign up for something like this!

265
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:21,031
I... I was played for an idiot!

266
00:13:21,114 --> 00:13:22,975
I'm not the one who swept them all away!

267
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:28,020
Hey idiot, the only person who got swept away here is you.

268
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:29,523
You've got two choices:

269
00:13:29,637 --> 00:13:31,708
Keep making excuses to cover your ass,

270
00:13:31,998 --> 00:13:33,747
or find a way to fix this.

271
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:40,461
Last one! Thank goodness!

272
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,898
Lovely to see you again, Koro-sensei.

273
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:49,718
Ordinary water is bad enough, isn't it?

274
00:13:49,906 --> 00:13:52,114
Worse still is water treated with a chemical agent

275
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:53,666
designed to slow you down.

276
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:57,806
Your own student saw to it that things went swimmingly.

277
00:13:58,156 --> 00:13:58,886
Itona.

278
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,460
How's it goin', brother?

279
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:04,884
I believe you an' me are slated
for a friendly little rematch.

280
00:14:07,903 --> 00:14:10,009
I always thought of myself as strong.

281
00:14:10,572 --> 00:14:13,536
I singled out the wimps and made
sure to put 'em under my thumb.

282
00:14:13,947 --> 00:14:15,673
Great way to feel like a boss.

283
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:18,358
But at this school,

284
00:14:18,695 --> 00:14:21,092
none of the usual tricks landed worth a damn.

285
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:25,095
Yo, let's ditch next period
and hit up the convenience store?

286
00:14:25,186 --> 00:14:26,325
Yeah, no.

287
00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:28,582
I'm sorry, man. I've gotta study up for my English exam.

288
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:31,812
Lighten up. Skipping one class
ain't gonna matter that much.

289
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:34,281
Does the ape not wanna play hooky by himself?

290
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:34,954
What?

291
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:38,936
Here, no one ever caved.

292
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:40,834
No one respected me.

293
00:14:41,494 --> 00:14:43,203
You need to get with the times, bro.

294
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:45,114
The alpha male crap might've worked in middle school,

295
00:14:45,197 --> 00:14:46,714
but it's a different story now.

296
00:14:47,478 --> 00:14:49,509
Once you're pushed to E Class, you're nothing.

297
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:52,464
And nobody's as scared of you as they are of that.

298
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:55,620
Your grades have been in a downward spiral all year.

299
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:58,822
One of these days, you're in for a rude awakening.

300
00:14:58,906 --> 00:15:01,499
People like me will be throwing rocks at people like you.

301
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
That's when the reality of it hit me.

302
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:07,937
When I realized my tough-guy
act was a joke to these people.

303
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:11,748
I was through. No one would ever take me seriously again.

304
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:16,229
All the dweebs and jerk-offs I used to
push around would grow up to be big shots.

305
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:17,492
They'd run the show,

306
00:15:17,636 --> 00:15:20,527
and shiftless dumbasses like
me would be under their thumb.

307
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,296
When I first got put into E Class, I figured,

308
00:15:23,364 --> 00:15:25,947
"Hey, no prob, Everyone's the same as me.

309
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:27,692
I can afford not to care."

310
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:29,447
But then he showed up.

311
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:31,745
Out of nowhere, things changed again.

312
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:34,335
Suddenly we had a goal, a purpose.

313
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:36,214
And now here I am.

314
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:39,156
A lazy, good-for-nothin' chump with no future,

315
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,675
caught up in someone else's master plan.

316
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:43,234
Dammit!

317
00:15:43,614 --> 00:15:44,504
He's fast!

318
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,283
And rather stronger than I recall.

319
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,197
We reduced the number of tentacles,

320
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,813
focusing the speed and power in those remaining.

321
00:15:52,197 --> 00:15:54,524
Now even a simple child can master them.

322
00:15:56,224 --> 00:15:57,295
This is unreal!

323
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,589
That's maybe a foot of water.

324
00:15:58,614 --> 00:16:00,634
Can it seriously throw him off that much?

325
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:02,489
The water ain't his only problem.

326
00:16:02,572 --> 00:16:03,614
You've got some nerve!

327
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,429
Look, he just saved you from drowning.

328
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:07,299
He can't go all out 'cause he's spent.

329
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,436
And his attention's still divided.

330
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:10,160
Oh, no!

331
00:16:10,397 --> 00:16:13,328
That branch can't support Hara's weight! She's gonna fall!

332
00:16:13,392 --> 00:16:14,618
He can't focus on the fight

333
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:16,231
because he's too worried about them!

334
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:18,989
'Specially her. That fatty'll be toast soon.

335
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:20,072
We have to help!

336
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:20,671
How?

337
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:24,322
Wait, hold on a sec. This wasn't even your plan, was it?

338
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:25,697
You got roped into this.

339
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:26,239
Hmph.

340
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,406
Like a head of cattle, but hey, that's what happens

341
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:30,864
when you got sight and no vision.

342
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:34,375
Some smartass wolf comes along and,
before you know it, you're on the menu.

343
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:35,647
Thing is, though.

344
00:16:36,364 --> 00:16:38,618
If I'm gonna be played, I pick the tune.

345
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:43,197
I've had it up to here with these jerks,
and the idea of them gettin' the prize money?

346
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:44,489
Don't get me started.

347
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:45,822
You're a smart dude, Karma.

348
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:48,031
You be the puppet master, and I'll be the puppet.

349
00:16:48,114 --> 00:16:48,637
Hm?

350
00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:50,129
Come up with something awesome.

351
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:52,631
If you"re the brains, then I'm the brawn, you got it?

352
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:54,614
Give me a plan and I'll save every one of 'em,

353
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:56,573
fatty and the monster included!

354
00:16:56,752 --> 00:16:59,289
I don't know. Sure you want to be my lackey?

355
00:16:59,447 --> 00:17:00,934
I'm pretty devious.

356
00:17:01,072 --> 00:17:01,683
Huh?

357
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:03,661
You might get killed.

358
00:17:04,114 --> 00:17:05,572
Ooh, big deal.

359
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:08,347
Devious I can handle, just make sure you've got a vision.

360
00:17:08,771 --> 00:17:11,232
Now, Itona. Strike the killing blow.

361
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,954
What's up?

362
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:14,179
Can I help you?

363
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:17,197
So, bet you jerks think you played me pretty good.

364
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:18,771
Does that wound your ego?

365
00:17:19,197 --> 00:17:20,197
There's something to be said

366
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:21,903
for being the perfect foil, my friend.

367
00:17:22,364 --> 00:17:25,781
Or are you suddenly upset we endangered
the classmates you care nothing for?

368
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:26,947
Laugh it up, man.

369
00:17:27,031 --> 00:17:28,861
Payback's about to be real bitch.

370
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,063
Itona! You an' me, one-on-one, right now!

371
00:17:32,145 --> 00:17:33,895
Don't be ridiculous, Terasaka!

372
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:35,096
He'll throttle you!

373
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,996
I wasn't talkin' to you, Tentacles!

374
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:39,897
He's tapped into his inner hero.

375
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:42,322
Shut him down, Itona. For good.

376
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,344
What've you done?

377
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:44,647
No worries.

378
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,276
They're not gonna to kill a student.

379
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:47,857
We're too valuable alive.

380
00:17:48,864 --> 00:17:50,031
As long as we're in danger,

381
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:52,315
Koro-sensei can't concentrate on the fight.

382
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,436
Even Hara isn't that bad off.

383
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:57,655
If she falls, either he or Itona is bound to catch her.

384
00:17:58,072 --> 00:18:00,181
It may look like he's in over his head,

385
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,303
but Terasaka knows exactly what to expect.

386
00:18:04,322 --> 00:18:06,433
Tentacle Boy will try to knock him unconscious,

387
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:08,864
but if he grabs on and rides it out, we're good.

388
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:11,531
That's an impressive grip you've got there.

389
00:18:11,614 --> 00:18:13,964
Let us see if it holds up under another lashing.

390
00:18:14,314 --> 00:18:14,731
Uh.

391
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:18,114
That's yesterday's shirt.

392
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:20,559
The one he had on when he bug-bombed the class.

393
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:22,531
Unless he did laundry last night,

394
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:23,864
there's still some residue on it

395
00:18:23,947 --> 00:18:26,351
from whatever weird chemical was in that can.

396
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:29,704
I figure if it affected Koro-sensei, it'll effect Itona.

397
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:30,863
And there you go.

398
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:32,614
Now Tentacle Boy's distracted

399
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:34,837
and the Octopus has a chance to rescue Hara.

400
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,656
You gotta love a good plan.

401
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:38,572
Yoshida! Muramatsu!

402
00:18:38,656 --> 00:18:40,762
Give us a nice big splash, okay?

403
00:18:41,502 --> 00:18:42,572
He's out of his mind.

404
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:43,393
I like it.

405
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:46,229
Logically, the two of them have the exact same weaknesses.

406
00:18:46,614 --> 00:18:49,995
Easy, turn the kid's own tactics against him, and voila.

407
00:19:00,864 --> 00:19:02,864
Well, that escalated quickly.

408
00:19:02,947 --> 00:19:05,781
Looks like you've got a problem
with water retention there, pal.

409
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:09,175
All right, here's the deal.

410
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:12,364
We're not okay with you hogging all the prize money,

411
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:14,322
or with the fact that your plan revolved around

412
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:15,856
putting our lives on the line.

413
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,377
Slapping one of our own around doesn't sit well either.

414
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:20,163
So if you wanna keep at this,

415
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:23,031
you're going to have to face all of us.

416
00:19:26,114 --> 00:19:27,487
Well played, children.

417
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:29,054
We withdraw.

418
00:19:29,947 --> 00:19:32,199
The slaughter of innocents was never our intention.

419
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:35,416
Who can predict how his anti-matter organs would react?

420
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:37,378
Come along, Itona.

421
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:39,629
Ah!

422
00:19:39,694 --> 00:19:42,572
Wasn't that a fun way to while away the afternoon, class?

423
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:44,982
And there's always room for one more.

424
00:19:45,822 --> 00:19:46,508
Itona.

425
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,906
I thought we'd never get rid of those two.

426
00:19:53,989 --> 00:19:55,531
We saved your bacon, didn't we?

427
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:58,281
It's a good thing we're quick
on our feet or you'd been a goner.

428
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,841
That's adorable.

429
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,605
I still had a few tricks up my sleeve, just so you know.

430
00:20:03,906 --> 00:20:05,092
Hey, Terasaka.

431
00:20:05,197 --> 00:20:08,239
In case you're wondering, I
heard your cracks about my weight.

432
00:20:08,322 --> 00:20:10,322
We "fatties" prefer the termc "full-figured."

433
00:20:10,414 --> 00:20:11,989
Oh, uh. Didn't mean to be a dick!

434
00:20:12,072 --> 00:20:13,989
Just sizing up the situation all objective-like.

435
00:20:14,072 --> 00:20:15,189
Sizing it up?

436
00:20:15,403 --> 00:20:18,239
I may be on the hefty side, but I can still kick your ass!

437
00:20:18,322 --> 00:20:20,919
Wow. Awkward. A little tact goes a long way, man.

438
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:22,174
You should try it next time.

439
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:25,114
Kinda hard to run from the wolves with
your foot in your mouth, just sayin'.

440
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:28,697
Why don't you get down off your perch and
say that to my face, you little turd bucket!

441
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:29,626
How 'bout that?!

442
00:20:30,822 --> 00:20:31,261
Hey!

443
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,033
I'm s'posed to be your puppet master, remember?

444
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:37,649
Don't even go there! That was a temporary arrangement
and you're not the one who took a tentacle to the gut!

445
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:40,114
That's right! I was down here taking all the hits

446
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,364
'cause you don't have the balls to do your own dirty work!

447
00:20:42,447 --> 00:20:44,513
True, you sorta kept your distance the whole time.

448
00:20:44,697 --> 00:20:46,656
Oh, don't like getting your hands dirty, huh?

449
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:47,716
We can fix that.

450
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:50,897
I think we can all agree

451
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:53,833
Terasaka isn't exactly cut out to be a mastermind,

452
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:57,752
but when tasked with putting
someone else's plan into action,

453
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:01,656
he's invaluable. On the field, his
confidence shines through and things get done.

454
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:02,874
It's as simple as that.

455
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:06,164
No self-respecting assassination
squad should be without him.

456
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:07,180
Definitely.

457
00:21:07,577 --> 00:21:10,915
Terasaka may be hot-headed, but he belongs here.

458
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:14,443
I'm glad he's finally adjusting. We all are.

459
00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:18,774
Trouble is, we're so caught up in
the moment, we've overlooked something.

460
00:21:19,364 --> 00:21:21,084
Something major, actually.

461
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,873
Koro-sensei's biggest weakness yet.
