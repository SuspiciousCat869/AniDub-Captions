[AIKO] Nagumo, is there anything
you can do about this army

[AIKO]
Please, Nagumo.

There must be something
you can do for us!

Without your help,
those creatures will destroy

the entire town, and hundreds
of innocent lives will be lost.

my students first.

I know I wasn't there for you

I'll swear my loyalty to you!

323
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,305
I'll do whatever you want.

324
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,807
Just let me live.

325
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,310
Please, no!

326
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,645
[gunshots]

327
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,484
How could you?

328
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,572
[HAJIME]
He was lying.

329
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,866
Not true.
You heard what he said!

330
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,744
[HAJIME] You think he's
magically reformed?

331
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,871
Sorry, but I'm not
some bleeding heart.

332
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,581
I don't believe
in crap like that.

333
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,167
You could've saved him,
but you chose death?

334
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,251
Exactly.

335
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,171
I killed one of your
precious students.

336
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,756
I thought over what you said.

337
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,008
But I won't let my enemies live.

338
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,009
You see.

339
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,428
I don't have any mercy
left inside of me.

340
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,431
Understand? Not a drop.

341
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,558
[AIKO]
Shimizu... No...

342
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,359
[HAJIME]
You want a reason?

343
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,780
I told you. He was our enemy.

344
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,240
[WILL]
That's not why you did it.

345
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,326
If you hadn't shot him,
he still would've been dead

346
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,368
in minutes.

347
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,621
Didn't realize you were
paying that much attention.

348
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,914
Hajime.

349
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,749
You're so nice to your teacher.

350
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,258
[SHEA] That shot that got
Shimizu was actually aimed

351
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,843
at Aiko, wasn't it?

352
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,138
But since you killed him,

353
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,432
she doesn't have to think
he died because of an attack

354
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,184
meant for her.

355
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,228
[TIO] It would've broken
her heart, but now,

356
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,396
she can still be the
profoundly caring teacher

357
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,898
she always was.

358
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:57,733
[YUE]
You know...

359
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,569
Aiko will realize what you did.

360
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,862
And I think...

361
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,323
...her words had a
profound impact on you.

362
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,741
They're in your blood now.

363
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,924
[MYU]
ARIFURETA:
