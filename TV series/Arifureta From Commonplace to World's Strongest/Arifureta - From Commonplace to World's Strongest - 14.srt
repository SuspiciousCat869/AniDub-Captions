[HAJIME] Well, let me
tell you what I think.

169
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,147
I think those monsters of
yours were created

170
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,191
by a form of ancient magic.

171
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,403
And there's only one
way to gain the ability

172
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,572
to use ancient magic
as far as I'm aware,

so I bet you demons
cleared a great labyrinth.

Looks like I'm
right on the money.

Tell me.

00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,413
Did you really think
you were strong enough

177
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,332
to make it to the end of hell?

178

It's starting to make sense.

If you were anything like them,

180
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,088
then your monstrous
appearance and inhuman strength

181

would check out.

"Anything like them," huh?

I think my eyes must be
playing tricks on me.

323
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,450
I could swear that
I see a thunder cloud

324
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,536
and a lightning dragon
forming behind Yue!

325
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,580
[MYU] And I see a big,
smiling, white face

326
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,540
floating behind Miss Kaori!

Look at the two of them.

This will be quite an
interesting journey.

By the way, I've been
meaning to ask you

332
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,427
about this "Papa" business!

00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,721
Is this girl really your
daughter, Hajime?

Yue? Shea?

Don't tell me it
was that pervert!

the only one! Is she?

00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,820
[HAJIME] Is it really okay
to bring her with us?

It'll be fine.

We're the world's

Hey, Nagumo.

351
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,700
Thanks for letting me use this.

352
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,326
You can keep it if you want.

353
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,621
I'm not really much
of a sword guy.

Well, thank you then.

355

[HAJIME] I made it by condensing
the world's strongest metal.

You'll never find a
sharper, more durable sword.

Wow. That's an incredible
skill you have.

I always thought a synergist
would be useless in battle.

But, hey, you've
proven me wrong.

360

About a lot of things.

361
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,182
I'll use this sword
as if it were a part

of my own body.

She's the real final boss.

What do you want me to say?

known she felt this way?

Oh, I've known for a long time.

a candle for Nagumo.

Anyone who tries to
stop me or gets in my way

is my enemy.
