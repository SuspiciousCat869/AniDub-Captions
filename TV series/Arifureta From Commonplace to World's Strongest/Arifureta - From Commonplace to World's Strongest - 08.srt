1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,763
[HAJIME sighs]

2
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,100
All this says is that the
entrance to the labyrinth

3
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,644
is in Reisen Gorge.

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,521
Thanks for nothing, mapmaker.

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,522
[SHEA]
Uh‐huh.

6
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,273
Sure, uh, whatever.

7
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,776
What's wrong?
Why are you squirming like that?

8
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,569
Um... I just...

9
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,197
...need to go powder
my nose pretty badly.

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,366
You won't find a
bathroom down here.

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,244
[SHEA]
Aww...

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,123
[HAJIME] Anyway, since we
can walk through the gorge

13
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,667
on the way to Gryuen,

14
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,253
we may as well hit up
the labyrinth if we can find it.

15
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,755
[SHEA]
Hajime!

16
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,757
I found something
I think you'll like!

17
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,676
Quick, come look over here!

18
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,015
[SHEA]
See? Isn't it weird?

19
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,645
[MILEDI] Hi, there!
Glad to meet you!

20
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,898
Let me be the first to welcome
you to Miledi Reisen's

21
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,442
Super Duper Exciting Labyrinth!

22
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,403
What? Where is that
voice coming from?

23
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,488
Who cares, it's the entrance
you were looking for!

24
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,366
Now our adventure
can really begin.

25
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,618
So... Do you
think this is legit?

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,661
Mm‐hmm.

27
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:18,745
Why's that?

28
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,872
Miledi was in Oscar's notes.

29
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,873
Okay.

30
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,917
Now, how are we
supposed to get inside?

31
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,711
Dunno.
It's probably complicated.

32
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,379
[SHEA yelps]

33
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,969
You're kidding.

34
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,203
Where'd she go?

35
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,873
[YUE]
Ugh.

36
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,458
The bunny wet herself.

37
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,295
[SHEA whines]

38
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,550
Don't look. Let's pretend
this never happened.

39
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,889
[MILEDI]
Did that scare ya?

40
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,975
Gave you quite
a fright, didn't it?

41
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,935
Gonna cry to your mommy?

42
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,896
Wah, wah! [giggles]

43
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,565
Looks like it's about
time for me to test out

44
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,567
that thing you made me,
right, Hajime?

45
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,237
[SHEA yells]

46
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,578
[MILEDI]
Aww, nice try!

47
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,038
But these stone tablets will
automatically regenerate

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,957
after a certain amount of time.

49
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,334
I'm thinking Miledi Reisen
wasn't one of the Liberators

50
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,335
after all.

51
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,130
She's just a scourge
on humanity.

52
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,423
I have to agree.

53
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,549
[SHEA growls]

54
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,012
[HAJIME] It didn't seem like
this was going to end up being

55
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,096
a real labyrinth,

56
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,223
but it's definitely
got some maze vibes.

57
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,559
[HAJIME gasps]

58
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,150
[rumbling]

59
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,945
Stop!

60
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,989
Just as I thought,
we're not able to use

61
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,283
projectile magic in this place.

62
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,576
Well, that's lame.

63
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,250
Let me handle these balls!

64
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,002
[yelling]

65
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,936
[SHEA grunts]
Done!

66
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,189
Hurry, now's your
chance to pass!

67
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,273
[HAJIME]
Got it.

68
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,154
[SHEA yells]

69
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,824
We made it through!

70
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,453
[MILEDI]
How're you doing?

71
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,122
It looks like you might be
getting a bit of a headache.

72
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,457
[laughs]

73
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,751
[MILEDI]
Uh‐oh!

74
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,796
The floor in here
is ooey‐gooey gross!

75
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,005
[laughs]

76
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,883
[SHEA groans]

77
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,895
[MILEDI] Hey!
How's your day going, huh?

78
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,149
[SHEA]
That stupid witch!

79
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,277
If she makes fun
of me one more time...

80
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,949
[HAJIME] I feel like we've
seen this place before.

81
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:06,741
Don't you?

82
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,118
[YUE]
Definitely.

83
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,619
The puddle's still here.

84
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,582
[SHEA groans]

85
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,250
So are we back
in the first room?

86
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,334
Looks like it.

87
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,043
[MILEDI]
Guys!

88
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,879
Tell me how you feel right now.

89
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,463
Go on, don't be shy!

90
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,632
[SHEA grunting]

91
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,678
[YUUKA]
So, Nia.

92
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,931
Tell me, when is Ms. Aiko
heading out on her expedition?

93
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,850
I believe that she's
been scheduled to depart

94
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,060
sometime in the next
few days, ma'am.

95
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,312
[YUUKA sighs]

96
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,105
It's all happening so quickly.

97
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,400
But... I guess...

98
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,612
We'd just get sad if
she stayed here any longer.

99
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,779
[NANA]
Hey, Yuuka.

100
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,907
That's a weird look
on your face, heh.

101
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,867
So do you have
something on your mind?

102
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,784
[YUUKA]
Yeah.

103
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,579
I've been thinking, and I can't
keep sitting around here

104
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,539
doing nothing all day.

105
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,792
So I've decided that I'm
going to go with Ms. Aiko.

106
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,211
Hey. Have you
gone crazy or what?

107
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,963
That's a terrible idea.

108
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,549
I assure you that
I've thought about this.

109
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,010
It isn't a sudden decision.

110
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,597
Honestly, I've been feeling
this way for a while now.

111
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,641
Ever since Nagumo died.

112
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,436
Sure, I'm scared, and
confused about some things.

113
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,814
But I have to do something.

114
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,026
Surely you guys feel
the same way, right?

115
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,110
Seriously?

116
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,737
It isn't safe out there.

117
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,949
No! You could end up
exactly like he did.

118
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,451
You said it. He's dead.

119
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,578
All because he tried
to be brave.

120
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,248
Yes, but if he
hadn't acted bravely,

121
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,376
I wouldn't even be
standing here today.

122
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,543
Not just me.

123
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,964
Nagumo saved each
and every one of us.

124
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,716
Yeah. I guess so.

125
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,009
Besides...

126
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,596
I'm not saying any of
you have to go with me.

127
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,474
Stay here, but I refuse
to waste any more time.

128
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,267
Wait, Yuuka.

129
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,769
Are you sure?

130
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,107
Look, I don't have the guts
to go with Amanogawa

131
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,733
and the others.

132
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,444
So the least I can do
is keep Ms. Aiko safe.

133
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:29,384
[HAJIME panting]

134
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,386
Now that is an impressive door.

135
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,222
I'm pretty sure we just stumbled
upon Miledi's chamber.

136
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,223
Yes.

137
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,143
Well, shit, I wish we
had time to celebrate.

138
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,145
Problem is, I've got a
real bad feeling about

139
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,188
these suits of armor
lining the walls.

140
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,150
Don't worry about it.
At least we know what to expect.

141
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,278
Does that mean they're gonna
come to life and attack us?

142
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,071
Hey. Ms. Runny rabbit.

143
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,365
[SHEA]
Um... Yes? What is it?

144
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,658
You're a tough bunny.

145
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,618
You can handle
yourself in a fight.

146
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,620
So get in there
and have some fun.

147
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,540
We'll save you if it starts
to look like you're gonna die.

148
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,127
I take care of my pupils.

149
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,546
Aw, guys. That's so sweet!

150
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,344
Right! I'll beat the
heck out of Miledi!

151
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,646
[SHEA yelling]

152
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,994
[YUE] Carelessness
will get you killed.

153
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,329
Or punished by me.

154
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,539
I know! I'm... sorry!

155
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,797
[SHEA grunts]
Take this!

156
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,728
[HAJIME]
There's no end to 'em.

157
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,483
[SHEA yelling]

158
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,197
Everyone, quick, jump!

159
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,834
[MILEDI]
Hi, there!

160
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,919
Look at you,
comin' all this way.

161
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,131
This has to be some
kind of joke, right?

162
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,383
Oh, perfect. A giant.

163
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:37,137
Yeah. This definitely
feels like the big boss.

164
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,390
[MILEDI]
I'm everyone's favorite!

165
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,685
Miledi Reisen, at your service!

166
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,196
[HAJIME]
Who are you really?

167
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:59,033
Miledi Reisen was human and
would be long dead by now.

168
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,244
We read about her
in Oscar's notebook.

169
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:04,539
[MILEDI] Ooh! Oh, my gosh,
are you the ones who made it

170
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,082
through Oskie's labyrinth?

171
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,960
I'm the one asking
the questions around here.

172
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,545
If you don't feel
like answering me,

173
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,297
I'll just have to fight you.

174
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,340
We've come down here
to find ancient magic,

175
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,968
and we'll destroy anyone
who gets in our way.

176
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,469
[MILEDI]
I'm telling the truth!

177
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,430
I'm the real Miledi Reisen!

178
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,973
Promise!

179
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,933
If you want to know more,
you better start being

180
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,351
a little friendlier.

181
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,315
[MILEDI] What do you want
this ancient magic for?

182
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,234
It must be something important.

183
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,736
My goal is pretty simple.

184
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,237
I want to get back to my home.

185
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,948
The only reason I'm here is
because of some insane god.

186
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,202
So trust me, I'm not
in this world by choice.

187
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,536
[MILEDI]
I see.

188
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,622
That must've been tough on you.

189
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,624
[HAJIME] We're looking for
a form of ancient magic

190
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,959
that allows you
to jump between worlds.

191
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,711
Because I have no intention
of putting my life

192
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,130
on the line for this one.

193
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,757
That's my answer.

194
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,800
So, will the ancient magic
in this labyrinth

195
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,594
let me get to my world?

196
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,222
[MILEDI]
Hmm, let's see.

197
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,058
Nope! I don't think
I'm gonna tell you!

198
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,184
Then die!

199
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,519
Destroy her core!

200
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,979
That should be like her heart.

201
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,525
[SHEA yells]

202
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,405
[MILEDI]
Wow.

203
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,573
You're pretty good.

204
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,741
[HAJIME]
You think so?

205
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,201
[MILEDI]
Whoa, and fast, too.

206
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,494
[HAJIME]
How's this feel?

207
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,248
Did it work?

208
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,999
It felt like it did, but...

209
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,168
I really hope that was
the end of this fight.

210
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,421
[MILEDI]
Nah.

211
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,966
All your attack did
was tickle me.

212
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,010
Good thing this labyrinth is
sapping your weapon's power.

213
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,806
Shit, her armor.

214
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,683
It's Azantium.

215
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,851
[MILEDI]
The hardest metal in the world.

216
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,854
Now, how about another round?

217
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,523
Watch out! Above us!

218
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,068
[MILEDI laughs]

219
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,945
Let's play a game.

220
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,489
The objective is not
to get squished!

221
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:04,951
Not good!

222
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,452
Both of you, grab on!

223
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,537
[SHEA]
Okay!

224
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,169
[HAJIME]
They just keep coming!

225
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,971
[MILEDI]
Aw. They couldn't handle it.

226
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,849
But I guess if they couldn't
get past me, there's no way

227
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,852
they'd be able to beat
those bastard gods.

228
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,313
[HAJIME]
I have no interest in doing so.

229
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,606
I told you,
I just want to leave.

230
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,567
[MILEDI]
How'd you get up there?

231
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,736
Why bother telling you?

232
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,988
I've finished my job
as the decoy.

233
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,407
[YUE]
Force Rupture!

234
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,872
[MILEDI] You're not gonna beat
me, you mean, wannabe bullies.

235
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,082
My arms can regenerate
and fix themselves!

236
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:53,958
See?

237
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,960
Not if we don't let up on you.

238
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,963
[MILEDI]
That move again?

239
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,341
There's no way you're
getting through my armor.

240
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,134
[HAJIME]
I know!

241
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,392
[YUE]
Freeze! Crystal Coffin!

242
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,147
That should keep
her from moving.

243
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,948
This is the part where you die!

244
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,496
[MILEDI laughs]

245
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,248
Looks like you'll need
to be a little stronger.

246
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,295
You see, down here,
your magic isn't as powerful.

247
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,630
Shea!

248
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,756
Finish her off!

249
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,718
[SHEA yelling]

250
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,516
[MILEDI screaming]

251
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,615
Nice work, you guys.

252
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:08,533
Rabbit.

253
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,992
Bend down for me.

254
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,542
Hajime won't pet you.

255
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,918
So I'll do it instead.

256
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,379
Don't bunnies like that?

257
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,131
You did a good job, Shea.

258
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,340
[SHEA]
Aww!

259
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,426
Aw, Yue. Thank you.

260
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,052
Really.

261
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,304
I was so scared!

262
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:34,058
I didn't think we were
gonna stop that giant!

263
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,726
[crying]

264
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,853
[gasps]

265
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,187
Hold on a second!

266
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,272
Just now...

267
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,565
She called me by my name!

268
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,732
Hurray!

269
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,736
[MILEDI]
Uh, hey.

270
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,656
Sorry to ruin the love‐fest
you're having, but...

271
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,283
Hi.

272
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,869
I don't understand.
We destroyed your core.

273
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,246
[MILEDI] I used the last of my
energy to buy us enough time

274
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,998
to have a little chat.

275
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,083
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

276
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,293
Die already.

277
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,504
Well, it's less of a chat
and more of a warning.

278
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,214
You said you were going
to get all the Liberators'

279
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,800
ancient magic to achieve
your goal, right?

280
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,969
Then there's something
I wanna say.

281
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,221
[HAJIME]
Okay, shoot.

282
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,306
[MILEDI]
Good luck.

283
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,560
Well, isn't that nice
from the killer tin can.

284
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,146
[MILEDI] The thing is, those
gods we tried to take down

285
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,482
are some really
super‐duper bad guys.

286
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,358
So, I just wanted you
to know what you were

287
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,444
getting yourselves into.

288
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,612
[HAJIME]
Wait. Back it up.

289
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,489
Why're you acting like
we're going to end up

290
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,157
fighting these gods?

291
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,909
[MILEDI]
Because you will.

292
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,161
Because you are who you are.

293
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,329
One day...

294
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,207
You will become the God‐Killer.

295
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,917
[HAJIME]
You're not making sense.

296
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,627
The only way I'll bother
taking them out

297
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,879
is if they get in my way.

298
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,130
[MILEDI chuckles]

299
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,423
That's fine.

300
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,968
Tell yourself whatever you want.

301
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,180
The decisions you make
will surely make this world

302
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:57,558
a better, happier
place in the end.

303
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,269
Well, look at that.

304
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,146
I think she's finally going.

305
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:04,899
[MILEDI]
Have fun.

306
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,528
I hope you're able
to live your lives

307
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,030
with all the freedom
that you could ask for.

308
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,721
Hi there, buddies!
Surprise! It's Miledi!

309
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,265
Your best friend!

310
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,937
[laughs] Didn't you enjoy
the dramatic speech I gave

311
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,105
while dying?

312
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,023
No, please, I'm not
that great of an actor,

313
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,692
but I do respect my craft.

314
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,859
Don'tcha think?

315
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,029
[MILEDI gasping]

316
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,493
[MILEDI]
Truce?

317
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,418
[MILEDI]
Wait, don't!

318
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,128
This body is really delicate!

319
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,838
Calm down, please!
Deep breaths.

320
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,506
Let's talk this out.

321
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,550
Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay?

322
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,677

00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:16,596
Ha!

324
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,023
[HAJIME] So, the ancient power
you have is gravitic magic.

325
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,816
[MILEDI]
Please use it wisely.

326
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,320
Oh, but you and bunny girl don't
really have an affinity for it.

327
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,448
You'd need to be
at much higher levels!

328
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,326
How would you know?
Don't just assume that!

329
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,078
[MILEDI] Blondie here would
be perfect for it, though!

330
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,748
If you train hard,
you'll become a master!

331
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,213
Yeah, that's a good start.

332
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,798
But don't you have other stuff?

333
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,968
Like some useful artifacts or
rare materials or something?

334
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,095
Come on, hand them over!
Where's the stash?

335
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,555
I wanna be weighed
down with crap

336
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,348
when I get outta here.

337
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,891
I know you're hiding
the good stuff somewhere,

338
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,142
you annoying little turd.

339
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:08,230
To think that the first people
down here would be so greedy.

340
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,732
Yeah, I'm over this.

341
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,901
Later, you guys.
Don't come back.

342
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,781
[HAJIME]
You bastard!

343
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,451
[MILEDI]
Toodle‐oo!

344
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,995
Try not to die in
another labyrinth!

346
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,258

[HAJIME coughs]

350
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,615
I'm gonna come back here one
day and obliterate that idiot.

351
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,242
Yue, Shea, you two all right?

352
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,618
[YUE coughs]

353
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,120
Yes, I think so.

354
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,831
[HAJIME]
Was that...?

355
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,212
Hey, can't you swim?

356
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,351
[HAJIME]
C'mon. Wake up! Shea!

You little‐‐ Go drown
again, ya damn rabbit in heat!

361
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,667
That girl. Rabbit.

362
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,669
I can't believe she went
full tongue right after

363
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,005
I brought her back from
the brink of death. Moron.

[GIRL 07A]
Hello, travelers!

366
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,057
Um...
Welcome to the Masaka Inn.

367
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,144
I need a room now.
And food, whatever you have.

368
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,021
Might as well add on
a bath, too.

369
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,774
[SHEA] Just one room
for all three, please.

370
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,900
[GIRL 07A]
Wait...

371
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,693
The three of you
will share one bed?

372
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,070
No. We'll take two rooms.

373
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,031
Hajime and I will have our own.

374
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,157
Shea's alone.

375
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,366
Wait, that's not fair,

376
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,244
why am I excluded from
the group sleepover?

377
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,997
A single room works.
End of story.

378
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,791
But you'll be distracting.

379
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,793
Distracting?

380
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,086
What are you planning
to do in there?

381
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,963
[YUE]
What do you think?

382
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,007
[SHEA] New idea.
You sleep by yourself.

383
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,717
In another inn, for all I care.

384
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,053
I'll snuggle with Hajime.
Got it?

385
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,096
Oh, yeah? Then what?

386
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,473
Uh... I guess...

387
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:48,557
After that...

388
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,060
I'll ask Hajime to
take my virginity!

389
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,781
What's wrong?

390
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,491
Was it something I said?
