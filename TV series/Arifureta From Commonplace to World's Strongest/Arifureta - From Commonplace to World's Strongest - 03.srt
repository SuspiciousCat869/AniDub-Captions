No! Hajime!

I guess that thing's
supposed to keep you in here?

Take this.

You gotta wear something.

Don't look at me like that.

00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,819
Hold on to me and
don't let go, okay?

Nice trick.

I know this is

And I'm sorry.

39
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,483
But do you think you
can cast it again?

40
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,278
I can, but it won't
be nearly as strong.

41
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,946
That works for me.

42
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:03,822
Now, then.

43
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,032
You remember the spot where
I shot him with my Donner?

44
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:06,867
[YUE]
Mm‐hmm.

45
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,159
When I give the
signal, you hit him

in the exact same place.

47
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,164

[HAJIME]
Huh?

54
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,455
Why didn't you just leave
me behind and run away?

55
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,166
[HAJIME]
That's not how I do things.

56
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,002
You were betrayed by the
people you put your trust in.

57
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,588
And I promised that
I would keep you safe.

58
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,798
I won't leave unless
you're with me.

00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,641
[HAJIME]
If I remember right,

60
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,184
300 years ago,

61
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:18,772
the vampires were supposedly
eradicated in a war.

62
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,273
Has it been that long?

63
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,734
[HAJIME] That must've started
after you were sealed.

64
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,195
Wait, exactly how old
does that make you?

65
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,237
Uh...

66
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,115
Don't be rude.

67
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,575
[HAJIME chuckles]

68
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,244
So, what's the deal?

69
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,622
Do all vampires live that long?

70
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,457
[YUE]
No, I'm the exception.

71
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,793
I don't age because
I can regenerate.

72
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:43,088
[HAJIME] Huh. Your special
magic makes you immortal.

73
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,381
[YUE]
Mm‐hmm.

74
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,298
Got it.

75
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,217
I don't suppose you'd
happen to know where we are

76
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,218
right now.

77
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,845
Or, better yet, a quick
way to the surface.

78
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,806
[YUE]
No, I don't.

79
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,891
But legends say this labyrinth

80
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,394
was built by one
of the Mavericks.

81
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,312
What's a Maverick?

82
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,856
They were once
messengers of the gods.

83
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,191
But then they rebelled.

84
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,235
And turned against
their masters.

85
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,821
They actually tried to
put up a fight against gods?

86
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:11,282
In doing so, they attempted
to destroy our whole world.

87
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,076
But their plans crumbled.

88
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,412
After their failure, the
Mavericks fled to the safety

89
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,080
of their labyrinths.

90
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,165
[HAJIME] And you think
we're currently sitting

91
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,417
in one of them.

92
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,129
It's said that they're still
stalking in the darkness.

93
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,173
Hiding in the deepest
depths of their new homes.

94
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,843
So that's what's waiting
in the last ring of hell.

95
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,470
[YUE] If we go there, we might
find a way to the surface.

96
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,850
Possibly, yeah.

97
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,727
If someone could
wield divine magic,

98
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,187
I'm betting they could
conjure up a path to the surface

99
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,522
without any problem.

100
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,986
The monster's carapace
is Shtar ore,

101
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,363
a stone with a unique
magical property.

102
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,742
The more mana it absorbs,
the stronger it becomes.

103
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,535
No wonder it was
so hard to kill.

104
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,754
What is that you're making?

105
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,880
It's a weapon.

106
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,716
An antimaterial rifle
meets a railgun.

107
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:10,842
Railgun?

108
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,011
Exactly. You saw my revolver.

109
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:18,850
Donner is a powerful gun.
The bullets are special, too.

110
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,727
But I'm gonna use this
Shtar ore to upgrade it

111
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,854
into something that
packs a bigger punch.

112
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,940
All done. Let's see now.

113
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,151
This one's named Schlagen.

114
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,404
How did you come to
be down here, Hajime?

115
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,157
And how is it you can
directly manipulate mana?

116
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,158
[HAJIME]
Huh?

117
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,285
Why are you able
to digest monsters?

118
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,662
Are you a human?
What happened to your arm?

119
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,456
Hey, one question at a time!

120
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,917
I'll explain everything,
just gimme a sec!

121
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:46,961
[HAJIME]
Let's see.

122
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,047
Where's the best place
to start the story?

123
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,802
One day, my classmates
and I were summoned

124
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,471
to this world by the god Ehit.

125
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,264
The people here said
we were supposed to be

126
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:02,435
the ones who'd save
humanity from demonkind.

127
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,187
I was assigned
to be a Synergist,

128
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,065
which isn't really a combat job.

129
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,818
Everyone said I was
totally useless in a fight.

130
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,778
Which seemed true.

131
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,696
We teamed up with the
Royal Guard to clear out

132
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,908
this labyrinth,
but things went wrong.

133
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,618
In the middle of
fighting a Behemoth,

134
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,954
one of my classmates
betrayed me and I ended up

135
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,205
in the depths.

136
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:27,335
A huge beast ate my arm,
almost killing me.

137
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,755
But I decided that I was going
to survive no matter what.

138
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,759
That meant using my Synergist
abilities to kill a monster

139
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,885
and eat it.

140
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:42,642
[YUE crying]

141
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,103
Whoa, why're you crying?

142
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,981
It's just... so sad.

143
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,816
You've suffered just like me.

144
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,736
You shouldn't be sad.

145
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,573
I don't give a crap about
my classmates anymore.

146
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,284
I don't even want revenge
for what happened.

147
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,577
All I care about

148
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,829
is getting as
strong as possible.

149
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,165
I have to do my all to survive

150
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,667
so that I can find
a way back home.

151
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,877
Back home?

152
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,503
[HAJIME]
Yeah, that's the plan.

153
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,256
I mean, sure, a lot
has changed about me.

154
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,342
But getting back home
is still my ultimate goal.

155
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,220
Oh. I'd say the same.

156
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,930
But I have no home now.

157
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,019
I don't need my old name.

158
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,854
I want one that you choose!

159
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,983
[HAJIME]
Ah, man.

160
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,198
[HAJIME] How about you
come with me, then?

161
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,242
Back to my home, I mean.

162
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,244
It might be pretty boring.

Well, if that is the case...

Then something
is controlling them?

Which means if we
don't kill whatever it is
