Am I alive?

00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,884
Or is this what happens
when you die?

3
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,263
It's so dark.
I can't see anything.

4
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,228
Nah. I don't think
I'm dead just yet.

5
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,398
So, am I still in the
Great Orcus Labyrinth?

6
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,525
I fell a long way.

7
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,402
I couldn't have gone
so deep that I'm in

00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:36,031
an unexplored area, right?

9
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,784
Either way, I need
to start going up.

10
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,744
There's gotta be some
stairs somewhere.

11

This level is huge.

Not like any of
the chambers before.

A rabbit? All the way down here?

supposed to be tougher

[HAJIME]
I'm alive, but how?

52
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:34,876
Is that...
a Holy Crystal? It is.

53
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,213
A mythical stone created
by mana crystallization.

Formed over a millennia.

55

"The saturation of mana
creates a liquid

56

that begins to flow
from the stone.

57
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,476
This liquid is called Holy
Water and has the ability

58
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,938
to heal any injury
and dispel any curse."

will help me survive if
I can't fight for myself.

I can't fight that

It's way tougher

Yes! We were in

You wouldn't say anything
when I called to you.

So what am I supposed to do?

Why should I have to suffer
such a horrible fate?

What did I do?
I don't deserve this!

210
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:33,855
I was brought to this world
in some crazy turn of events.

211
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,525
Then my classmates betrayed me.

212
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,320
The monsters here are too
powerful for me to fight.

213

I'm trapped in a metaphorical
and literal pit of despair.

So what next?

I want to survive and go home.

Which makes anything between
me and my goal the enemy.

Looks like eating monster
meat bumped my level up.

exactly what it sounds like.

I didn't even need
to say the spell.

261
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,924
Who knew that choking down
monster meat would do this.

262
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,800
It's like a training shortcut.

That move. Whoa. Check it out.

The mana's turning redder,
just like the monsters'.

266
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,858
I can't shoot it like that
two‐tailed wolf did,

267
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,986
but if I can manipulate the
voltage and not overdo it...

268
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,202
Smells like crap, but it's
better than eating the meat

00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,328
raw again.

270
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,165
I've got food and water.

some kind of weapon.

Nice!

273
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,549
I can identify a rock
just by grabbing it now.

274
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,384
I should be able to
make something useful

275
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,095
if I implement that
the right way.

276
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,306
Taur Stone. A solid black rock.

277
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,808
Hardness ranked at eight.

Toughness, eight.

279
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,020
Strong against physical
force and heat,

280
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,939
but weak against the cold.

281
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,524
Fragile when frozen.

282
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,651
Add heat to bond
with components.

283
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:56,909
Wow! Blast rock.
A flammable stone.

284
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,245
Can explode when pressure
and heat are applied

00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,205
in a confined space.

286
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,207
Sounds like gunpowder.

287
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,875
With enough volume and pressure,

288
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,379
explosions rival the highest
tier of fire magic spells.

289
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,716
And that's how you make bullets.

290
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,142
A six‐shot revolver and ammo,

291
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:25,021
both crafted from extremely
tough Taur Stone.

292
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,773
Each bullet packed
with Blast Rock powder.

293
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,736
Now, add a dash
of Lightning Field.

294

I'd better give my new
best friend a good name.

Now, then.

333
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,500
Time to get out
of this Labyrinth.

334
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,544
I'm gonna survive this nightmare
and find my way back home.

335
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,798
And I don't care
who stands in my way.

They try me, I'll kill 'em.
