1
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,517
[HANSEN]
Well, isn't that something.

2
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,644
[TOADY 11A] She was wanderin'
around all by herself

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,270
in the western seas.

4
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:21,730
[HANSEN]
Hell of a job, men.

5
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,235
This is a merfolk child.

6
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,530
She'll bring in a
hefty price, for sure.

7
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,949
Now, let's get ready
for the auction.

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,033
[TOADIES]
Yes, sir!

9
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,495
Mama.

10
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,805
[WILL]
Please forgive me, Ilwer!

11
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,849
I've been such a burden to you.

12
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,392
Don't be ridiculous!

13
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,561
I'm glad you're home safe.

14
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:27,105
To be honest, I didn't
think you'd make it back alive.

15
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,775
Eh. He just got
lucky, that's all.

16
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,861
Anyway. I'm gonna need one
more status plate, please,

17
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,529
if you don't mind.

18
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,656
[ILWER]
You got it.

19
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,163
[TIO] I'm sorry, but are you
sure it was appropriate for me

20
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,291
to receive a gold
top‐rank status plate?

21
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,584
[YUE]
Sure.

22
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,003
Oh! I forgot.

23
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,673
You made a promise, Hajime!

24
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,132
Hey, don't be mean!

25
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,759
You said that if I
worked really hard,

26
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,053
you would show me around
to all the touristy places

27
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,971
in Fuhren, remember?

28
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,934
Hm? What's the matter?

29
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,526
[TIO] I heard this city
was a hub for commerce,

30
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,529
but it seems there's more
to it than meets the eye.

31
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,031
Well, I don't care
who comes after us.

32
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,367
I'll take 'em down
in a heartbeat.

33
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,911
You honestly don't
care who they are?

34
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:23,870
[HAJIME]
Nope.

35
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,789
It could be a god
for all I care.

36
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,432
[TIO whimpering]

37
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,643
We have only one enemy.
God himself.

38
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:51,356
He's wise and strong, but still,
he's by no means indestructible.

39
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,191
[groans]

40
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,444
Someday, the time will come...

41
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:59,906
...when he must cease
his dark machinations.

42
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,324
One day, child,

43
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,494
a mighty being will appear
who possesses the ability

44
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,329
to defeat God.

45
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,248
So, Tio.

46
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,541
Yes, Father?

47
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,713
You must live.

48
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:19,426
[TIO crying]

49
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,184
[ELDER 11A]
Tio! You did come!

50
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,852
[TIO]
Indeed, Elder.

51
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,396
I felt a strange
thrumming in my chest.

52
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,940
Is there trouble here
on the continent?

53
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,610
Yes, it looks as though
God has summoned forth

54
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,655
a host of alien beings, and
their numbers are quite great.

55
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,282
Then I shall go at once.

56
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,200
[DRAGONPEOPLE gasp]

57
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,618
I have no choice.

58
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,913
This will change
our world immensely.

59
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,665
Something deep inside
is telling me it's true.

60
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,463
Esteemed leader,

61
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,300
and my beloved
dragon brethren, as well!

62
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,720
I have no way of predicting
what destiny awaits me,

63
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,307
nor what anyone's fate holds.

64
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,685
But... I feel that
things will change.

65
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,020
And that feeling...

66
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,234
...is really, really good!

67
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,777
[slap]

68
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,154
[TIO whimpering]

69
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,573
Hurry and wake up.
It's shopping time!

70
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,077
[TIO yelps]

71
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,876
This kind of weather
is perfect for a date!

72
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,295
Watch where you're
going, or you'll trip.

73
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,463
[SHEA chuckles]

74
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,473
Hey, Hajime, look at that!

75
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,308
Can we go there next?

76
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,644
[HAJIME]
Hm? An aquarium?

77
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,449
[SHEA]
Ah!

78
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,536
Wow. So this is a monster
that can talk, huh?

79
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,372
Says its name is Lehman.

80
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,833
Hey, pal.
Can you actually talk, or what?

81
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,005
Introductions first.
I don't know you.

82
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,423
My name's Hajime.

83
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,841
Tell me, Lehman.

84
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,885
Just what the hell are you?

85
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,261
[LEHMAN]
Don't be rude.

86
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,807
If I asked you what a human was,
how would you answer that, huh?

87
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:31,683
Fine.

88
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,102
If I have to give
an answer, I'm just me.

89
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,855
Nothing more than that,
and nothing less.

90
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,024
Now I have a question.

91
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,234
How exactly are you able
to detect the presence

92
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,111
of monsters nearby?

93
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,071
[HAJIME] If I had to guess,
I'd say it's 'cause I've

94
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,656
eaten monsters.

95
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,782
[LEHMAN]
Hmm?

96
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,913
[GIRL 11A]
Aw, that one's adorable!

97
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,915
[GUY 11A]
Not as adorable as you, darling.

98
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,583
[GIRL 11A]
You're so sweet!

99
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,709
[GUY 11A]
No, you!

100
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,004
[LEHMAN sobs]
You're making me cry!

101
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,007
To think, you were desperate
enough to eat monsters!

102
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:08,136
And despite all that, you turned
out to be such a decent fellow!

103
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,764
[SHEA]
Hey. No fair.

104
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,933
We're supposed to be on a date,
but you're still talking

105
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,684
to this crusty old monster.

106
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,270
Oh, no!
I'm spoiling your date?

107
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,272
I'm sorry about that, chum.

108
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,273
It's fine.

109
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,067
We should get
going soon, though.

110
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,235
Let me ask you
one more thing first:

111
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,363
what are you doing
in this aquarium?

112
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,199
Well... I had set off
alone on a journey,

113
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,285
but then I ended up swimming
into an underground current,

114
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,163
which brought me to the
surface, and here we are.

115
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,331
[HAJIME, SHEA gasp]

116
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,415
[LEHMAN]
What's wrong?

117
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,875
[HAJIME]
Uh... Lehman?

118
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,294
I'm just spitballing here,
but would you like us

119
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,587
to get you out?

120
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,968
Thanks, buddy. Really!

121
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,512
Uh... Don't mention it.
We're friends!

122
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,514
[BOTH laugh]

123
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,306
[LEHMAN]
You know...

124
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,141
When I was brought
to that prison,

125
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,561
there was a little
merfolk girl around, too.

126
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,813
Poor thing.

127
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:03,316
Seemed like she was being
bought and sold, just like me.

128
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,902
I should warn you,
there's a huge gang of slavers

129
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:06,987
in this city.

130
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,489
Better watch your back,
especially you, pretty lady.

131
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,908
[SHEA] Don't worry,
I'll be extra careful!

132
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,410
You do the same, okay?

133
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,995
[LEHMAN]
Thank you! Farewell!

134
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,043
Yue. Are you really
all right with this?

135
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,211
Him and Shea?

136
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,170
What else?

137
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,673
I mean, those two seem to be
growing awfully close recently,

138
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,590
don't you think?

139
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,925
[YUE]
That's wonderful.

140
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,969
[TIO]
What did you say?

141
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,096
You would honestly be
pleased to see another woman

142
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,597
with the man that you love?

143
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,349
[YUE]
She's not just anyone.

144
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,934
She's Shea.

145
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:42,897
[TIO]
Hmm?

146
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,315
You're chowing down.

147
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,692
Is it really that good?

148
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,653
Yes! Oh, question!

149
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,321
I just want to make sure.

150
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,949
You are okay with Tio
joining us, right?

151
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,200
Joining us, huh?

152
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,411
More like taking
advantage of the confusion

153
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,121
and then tagging along.

154
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,957
[SHEA chuckles]
You don't like her?

155
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,669
Well, putting aside the fact
that she's a raging pervert,

156
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,297
I don't mind her. And you?

157
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,175
Oh, I like Tio! Pervert or not!

158
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,141
Is there something wrong?

159
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,142
[HAJIME]
Not sure.

160
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,312
It's just, my Sense Presence
caught onto someone nearby.

they're small and weak.

Here's your change.

00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,913
Thanks so much.

171
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,499
At first, she was always
hanging on Hajime.

172
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,501
And her motives were
so blatantly obvious

173
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,835
that it was annoying.

174
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,838
But then I saw...

‐‐Something else?
‐‐Mm‐hmm.

176
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,260
She fights for the things
she loves, and people too.

177
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,179
She gives it
everything she's got.

178
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,181
That's so admirable.

179
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,058
She faces the world head‐on.

180
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,813
It's true that she
likes Hajime quite a bit.

181
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,731
However, she likes me, too.

She's one of the merfolk.

They live all the way
out in the western seas.

195

So it's strange to see one here.

196

And because they
benefit the kingdom,

197

they're the only race of
beastmen that are protected.

198
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,584
Obviously she's here because
something bad happened.

[HAJIME]
Myu, huh?

00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,855
I'm Hajime, and this is Shea.

[SHEA chuckles]

215
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,054
[HAJIME] Let's talk about
where to go from here.

216
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,348
Maybe we should find
out Myu's story.

217
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,724
[HAJIME]
Good call.

00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,309
Here you are. Enjoy.

219
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,147
[TIO] I see, so all three of you
have formed a close bond,

220
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,109
each bringing something
different to the relationship.

221
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,320
Still. You must be
at least a trifle worried.

222
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,321
[YUE]
Hm?

223
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,490
[TIO] What if she steals
Master's heart away?

224
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,868
She's a charming girl,
and he clearly cares for her.

225
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,911
Yes, he does.

226
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:10,290
I want him to be surrounded
by people he cares about.

227
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,249
But...

228
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,543
I'm special to Hajime.

229
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:18,006
If she tries to steal him,
then she will fail.

230
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,757
And so will you.

[TIO]
Please!

I have no desire
to challenge you.

233
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,470
So long as he continues
his rough treatment of me,

234
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,306
I'll be content.

was talking about.

242
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,318
They were probably
planning to sell her off

243
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,695
at some kind of
black‐market auction.

something like that?

like this city is full of 'em.

with the city guard.

00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,669
Dealing with lost kids probably
falls under their purview.

00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:57,628
But...

253

You said the merfolk
were protected.

I'm sure they'll take
good care of her.

Meaning they've sentenced
themselves to death.

Where's the girl now?

That's a good question

any solid leads.

So we figured the best
thing we could do would be

00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,670
to make an example out
of all the gangs involved

00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,612
You guys make me sick.

322
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,532
A trade that victimizes
innocent children.

323
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,659
I must admit,
I'm quite perturbed.

324
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,453
[TIO]
Hell is too good for you!

325
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,498
[TOADIES yell]

326
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,711
[SLAVERS]
Ooh...

327
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,343
[MYU] Are you leaving
because you hate me?

328
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:17,638
[MYU gasps]

329
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,808
Dammit! Don't just sit there.
Cry! Scream!

330
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,768
Put on a show for us!

331
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,730
Soon enough you'll learn
how a good girl acts.

332
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,732
You give me any trouble
and you're dead.

333
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,774
[HAJIME]
That's funny.

334
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,943
I was about to say the same
thing to you, asshole.

335
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,321
[HANSEN]
Who's there?!

336
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,239
[grunts]

337
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,034
Bastard!

338
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,000
[SLAVERS yelling]

339
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,804
[HAJIME]
Hey, Myu.

340
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,805
Aw, man.

341
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,682
Looks like we're gonna
have to dry you off again.

342
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,895
Big brother!

343
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,438
[crying]

344
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,029
Hold on. Close your
eyes for a second.

345
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,530
Uh, okay.

346
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,164
[HAJIME]
You can open them now.

347
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,173
Amazing! How are we flying?

348
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,676
Well, it's not
technically flying.

349
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,718
Anyway...

350
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,554
You're about to see one
heck of a fireworks display.

351
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,597
What's that?

352
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,140
Trust me, you'll like 'em.

353
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,518
Just say "Boom!"
when you're ready.

354
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,144
Okay, boom!

355
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,942
Pretty impressive, huh?

356
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,819
What do you think, Myu?

357
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,570
They're kinda scary.

358
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,158
[gasps]

359
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,918
Something's in the smoke!

360
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,671
Mm‐hmm. We've got some
bad guys to deal with.

361
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,571
[HAJIME]
I'd like for you to meet Yue.

362
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,531
She's my lover.

363
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,615
[MYU]
Huh?

364
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,247
No fair. You're just so cute!

365
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,875
Plus... You have been
very brave today.

366
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,168
You should be proud.

367
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,506
[MYU crying]

368
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:58,716
What's going on?

369
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,050
Wait, don't tell me.

370
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,136
I bet you said
something mean to Myu.

371
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,763
[HAJIME]
I don't bully little girls.

372
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,056
Feel free to take your
frustrations out on me.

373
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,266
[HAJIME]
Shut it, masochist.

374
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,976
[TIO]
Ooh!

375
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,519
[HAJIME]
Oh, yeah, that's our pervert.

376
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,189
Her name's Tio. Ignore her.

377
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,732
Big Brother.

378
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,317
Thank you for saving me!

379
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,485
Yeah, sure.

380
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,527
But hey...

381
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,697
How about we drop this whole
big brother thing now?

382
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,115
My name's Hajime.

383
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,784
[MYU]
How 'bout "Papa"?

384
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,202
No. That's worse.

385
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,828
Hajime will do just fine.

386
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,123
Unless it translates
to "Papa" in merfolk?

387
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,458
Papa's just Papa.

388
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,252
[YUE]
Why would you call him that?

389
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,463
Well, because.
I don't have a Papa.

390
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,465
But I can promote
my big brother!

391
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,009
Uh, this is all making
me very uncomfortable.

392
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,804
I know I have white hair,
but I'm still 17.

393
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,263
'Kay. What about "dad"?

394
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,599
[HAJIME] On second thought,
Big Brother works.

395
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,892
Let's go with that.

396
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,644
Just stop implying
I'm your father.

397
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,647
No! Don't be
so mean to me, Papa!

398
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,943
Hajime. I want a baby.

399
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,778
Ooh, yes, me too, please!

400
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,029
[TIO]
Cruel Master.

401
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,114
I, too, am prepared to conceive.

402
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,075
Let's not stall the
procreation any longer‐‐

403
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,952
[HAJIME] The only thing
that's stalled is your brain.

404
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,079
[TIO] Why am I the only
one you're admonishing?
