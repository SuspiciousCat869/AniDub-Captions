I can use Transmute

[MELD] Your Highness,
we found a new kind of trap

24
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,031
that utilized a glanz crystal.

25
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,410
It instantly transported
us to the 65th level.

Oh? That's quite deep.

27
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,624
Indeed, it's the deepest level
that's ever been reached,

[ISHTAR] I bid you welcome
to the world of Tortus.

On behalf of the entire kingdom,

00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,167
allow me to say
what an honor it is

00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:01,171
to have you brave
heroes here among us.

88
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,466
[KOUKI] According to Pope
Ishtar, there are three races

89
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,301
of creatures who
inhabit this world.

90
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:12,891
They are the humans,
the demons, and the beastmen.

91
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,520
For centuries, human and
demon‐kind had been engaged

00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,483
in a bloody war, with neither
side gaining the advantage.

93
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,819
But then, the demons
learned to control monsters,

94
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,655
tipping the scales
in their favor...

95
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,701
...and pushing humanity
to the brink of destruction.

96
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,665

creation worshipped

with incredible power

100
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,505
to this kingdom.

101
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,049
We are those heroes.

102
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,094

are in danger of annihilation.

and I say that we do it!

00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,776
I'll fight, too.

110
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,320

Uh...

323
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,794
Um, how about Yue?

324
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,920
[YUE]
Yue?

325
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:36,837
Uh‐huh.

326
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,799
Where I come from, it's a
word that means "moon."

327
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,300
[YUE]
Moon?

When I first walked in,

329
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,470
this room looked
like it was filled

330
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,389
with stars, and your
golden hair reminded me

331
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,643
of the moon in the night sky.

332
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,894
Sound good?

333
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,021
Perfect.

334
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,899
It sounds perfect!

335
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,859
Ah! Thank you!

336
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,736
It's no problem.

337
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:01,779

338
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,989
[HAJIME yells]

339
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,828
[YUE]
No! Hajime!
