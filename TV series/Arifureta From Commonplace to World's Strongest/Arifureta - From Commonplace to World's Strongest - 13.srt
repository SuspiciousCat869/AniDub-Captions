Maybe it's the floor we're on.

Yeah? So what?

325
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,015
[DEMON 12A] You should
learn more about exploiting

326
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,642
your enemy's weaknesses.

327
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,310
This is a war, after all.

Kouki, no!

Nagumo. I beg you.

331
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,528
Help them.

332
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,198
They need you.

333
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,202
I promise I'll protect you.

334
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,870
You'll be safe.

335
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,956
Even if it was, I owe you.

336
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,418
You gave me a chance,
and I am not gonna waste it.

00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,254
You could've saved him,
but you chose death?

00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,132
[MYU]
My Papa's strong!

339
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,218
He can save them, no problem!

[SHEA] Are you really sure
you don't want to?

341
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,392
It would be simple for
one such as yourself.

342
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,394
The decision is yours to make.

343
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,979
I'll always follow you,
no matter what.

344
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,358
Fine, let's go.

[KAORI]
I can't do it.

I... don't have enough

Look at you.

00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,755
I didn't think anyone in
your party actually had

351
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,090
the capacity for murder,

352
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,217
but you're really
prepared to kill me.

[SHIZUKU] Kouki's kindhearted
nature held us back.

00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,598
He wasn't ready
to kill, but I am.

I'll fix his mistake!

Kaori. You have to go back.
