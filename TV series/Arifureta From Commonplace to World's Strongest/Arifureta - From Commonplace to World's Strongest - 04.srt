00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:17,267
Wow.

2
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,241
This is some entranceway.

3
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,742
Check out those pillars.

4
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,162
Think we made it?

5
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,747
[YUE]
To the Maverick's lair?

6
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,507
Hope so, because that
means we're one step closer.

7
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,468
We'll beat whatever's down here
and then we'll get the hell out.

8
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,511
Okay.

9
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,900
[HAJIME]
Crap!

10
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,530
[HAJIME]
Hey, look.

11
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,115
See how huge that circle is?

12
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,950
This's gotta be the big boss.

13
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,868
[YUE]
Don't worry.

14
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,997
We're strong, we won't lose.

15
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,123
Hell no.

16
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,000
We're taking this bastard down.

23
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,189
[YUE] It looks like the
white one heals it.

24
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,274
[HAJIME]
All right, in that case...

25
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,067
...that one's the first to die!

[YUE, HAJIME gasp]

29
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,946
Okay, so the yellow
one's on defense.

30
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,073
One heals, one attacks,
one defends.

31
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,159
You're a well‐rounded
beastie, aren'tcha?

32
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,953
Take this!

What?

Is that me?

[BEAST growls]

44
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,550

Get the hell away from her!

[HAJIME]
Hey, wake up!

48
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,079
You've gotta snap out of it.

49
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,337
[YUE]
Hajime?

50
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,464
Yeah. Who else would it be?

51
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,673
You okay?

52
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,843
I was so frightened.

53
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,596
I thought I'd been
abandoned again.

54
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,473
Left alone in the darkness.

55
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,879
Listen up, we'll kill that
thing and get out of here,

56
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:46,341
make it to the surface,
and find a way home.

57
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,178
You and me.

58
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,682
Yeah!

59
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,481
That's settled.

60
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,149
Now how do we take it out?

61
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,153
[HAJIME]
I'm gonna try Schlagen.

62
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,823
I can only fire one shot
at a time, so I'll need cover.

63
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,991
[YUE]
I'm on it!

64
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,290
Just do what you need
to do‐‐I've got this!

[YUE chuckles]

69
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,653
That won't work on me again!

[HAJIME growls]

71
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,509
[HAJIME] Using a debuff to scare
the crap out of its enemies.

72
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,303
That's pretty intense.

73
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,847
But you'll need more
than that against me!

[HAJIME grunts]

75
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,113

[YUE gasps]

Are you okay?

No!

[BEAST growling]

114
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,796
[YUE]
I failed you.

115
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:22,922
I'm sorry.

116
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,475
Hey, stop crying. 'Kay?

117
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,685
You did great.

[YUE]
Hajime!

119
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,739
[HAJIME]
So slow.

Hurry! You need to run!

121
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,201
It's fine. Don't worry.

122
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:08,342
[HAJIME] Why do his attacks seem
so damn slow all of a sudden?

123
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,635
[YUE]
They're not slower.

124
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,721
You got faster somehow.

125
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,223
[HAJIME]
Yue, suck my blood.

126
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,517
We're gonna need
your magic soon.

127
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,228
So go on.
We've got a fight to win.

[HAJIME]
What the hell am I doing?

129
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,620
How long am I gonna
keep lying here?

130
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,004
[HAJIME]
If I don't get up,

131
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,215
I'm gonna lose her.

132

[YUE screaming]

133
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,760
[HAJIME]
Is that what I want?

134
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,803
To lose her to that monster?

135
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,767
My beloved... partner.

136

[HAJIME grunts]

138
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,816
I'll kill you!

139
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:11,489
[HAJIME] In that moment, I felt
something inside me awaken.

140
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,994
[HAJIME] Yue, when I give the
signal, cast Azure Blaze.

141
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,789
Focus on healing until then.

142
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,415
[YUE]
What about you?

143
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,334
[HAJIME]
Got a couple things to set up.

144

[HAJIME grunts]

145
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,848
You okay?

146
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,934
Hey, don't worry, I've got this.

147
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,363
[HAJIME grunts]

148
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,673
I've prepared a little
something special for you.

149
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,425
This is for hurting Yue!

[BEAST screeches]

151
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,411
[HAJIME]
Transmute!

152
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,413
Now it's time to close the trap!

153
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,711
[HAJIME]
Yue!

154
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,090

156

Hajime!

157
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,771
Sure hope we're done.

158
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,398
That's about all I got.

159
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,700
You did a great job.
I'm proud of you.

160
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,284
Yeah, back at'cha.

161
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,629
[AIKO]
You can't be serious!

162
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:14,964
You're going to
force those children

163
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,382
back into the fight already?

164
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,176
It's way too soon for that!

165
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,011
One of their friends
just died out there!

166
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,013
They should be taking time
to grieve and recover,

00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,391
not heading back out
into battle again!

168
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,728
The loss of that noble young
man was unfortunate, indeed.

169
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,771
Then don't force
the other students to risk

170
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,523
meeting the same fate he did!

171
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,985
If you do, I won't assist
on the farms anymore.

172
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,279
Allow me to make a proposal.

173
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,281
We'll take only
those who volunteer.

174
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,868
Any who do not wish to fight
will not be required to.

175
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,412
I suppose that
will just have to do.

Lady Aiko, as a Farmer,

177
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,207
your job is
incredibly important.

178
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,835
We humbly ask that you
continue using your abilities

179
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,838
to contribute to the
success of our agriculture.

180
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,089
[AIKO]
Excuse me.

181
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,218
[AIKO]
Nagumo, class.

182
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,262
I should have stood up
for you much sooner.

183
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,851
But I'll do better from now on.

184
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,019
I promise.

[SHIZUKU]
Kaori.

187
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,537
I'm okay. Don't mind me.

188
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,539
[SHIZUKU]
Take it easy, all right?

189
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,333
You're always
looking out for me.

190
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,462
[KOUKI] Kaori, I love how
kindhearted you are.

191
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,339
But we can't allow the
death of our classmate

192
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,757
to hold us back forever.

193
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,175
[SHIZUKU]
Hey, give her a break.

194
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,927
She needs to hear this, Shizuku.

195
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,346
Listen, we have to
keep moving forward.

196
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,097
I'm sure Nagumo would
want us to do our‐‐

197
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,682
I'm here for you,
so just let me know

198
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,018
if there's anything
I can do to help, okay?

199
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,186
Absolutely!

200
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:55,731
Whatever happens,
I've got your back 100%.

201
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,316
Thanks, Eri, Suzu.

202
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,859
That's so sweet of you.

203
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,569
[MELD]
All right, break's over!

204
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,904
Time to move out.
