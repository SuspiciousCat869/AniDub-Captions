1
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,347
Head of the Fuhren
Adventurer's Guild.

2
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,723
Ilwer Chang.

3
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,058
It's nice to meet you.

4
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:22,397
Hajime, Yue, and Shea.

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,317
You're not an easy
group to track down.

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,611
I've heard some
interesting rumors.

7
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,780
The people of Brooke
are all talking about a trio

8
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:33,033
of powerful travelers who carved
a path through Reisen Gorge.

9
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,451
Ya got the wrong group.

10
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,995
Local legends or not, I can
tell you've got the skills

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,289
to handle the request
I would like to make of you.

12
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,582
Don't think so.

13
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,504
Look, do you mind if I
just tell you what it is?

14
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,631
It's a lot less paperwork
for me if I can say

15
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,008
I formally asked for your help.

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,720
Tch. Just as I expected
from the head of a guild.

17
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,430
You won't take no for an answer.

18
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,910
She was unusually quiet.

19
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,703
Turns out she's asleep.

20
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,580
Well we're not
stopping on the way,

21
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,540
so let her rest while
she still can.

22
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,419
You're asking me to track
down a missing party?

23
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,379
[ILWER]
Correct.

24
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,506
A party of adventurers was
headed into the northern

25
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,341
mountains on a survey.

26
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,636
Count Cudeta's third son
was traveling with them.

27
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,222
I want you three to
rescue Will Cudeta.

28
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,682
A Count's son, huh?

29
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,518
He must've been traveling with
some pretty heavy muscle then.

30
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,648
[ILWER]
That's the troubling part.

31
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,483
Their disappearance might
mean they encountered

32
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,069
something stronger
than themselves.

33
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,904
And, if that's the case,

34
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,073
then a lot of people
are going to get hurt.

35
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:23,620
We know nothing of their fate,
and nothing of the enemy.

36
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,707
The Count is a friend of mine,
and he's turned to me for help.

37
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,958
[HAJIME]
A friend, huh?

38
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,379
Will your group agree
to take on this request?

39
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,880
Absolutely not.

40
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,634
Now, if there's nothing else,
I think we'd better go.

41
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,762
I'll make sure you're well
rewarded for your efforts.

42
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:44,099
[HAJIME] Sorry, but we're
in a bit of a hurry.

43
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,392
Well, then.

44
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:49,396
How about I simply agree
to always look the other way

45
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,273
when you find yourself
bumping up against

46
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,568
the rules of the
Adventurer's Guild?

47
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,779
I'll admit it's becoming
quite a tantalizing offer.

48
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,656
But I do have two conditions.

49
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:00,907
And they are?

50
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:01,742
[HAJIME]
First,

51
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,410
the three of us are going
to need you to make us

52
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,078
some Status Plates.

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,621
[ILWER]
And the second?

54
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,709
If we ever need you, you agree
to do exactly as we say.

55
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:11,877
Very well.

56
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,754
I think we have a deal.

57
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,963
Smart man.

58
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,719
Hajime.
You were so forceful.

59
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,803
Yeah, I was.

60
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,473
He clearly had his back
against the wall.

61
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,349
The more something
means to someone

62
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,728
the more you can get them
to agree to do for you.

63
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,605
There's something
more to it, though.

64
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,106
You figure it out?

65
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,775
Right now, we're headed to Ur.

66
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,068
We'll get some food and spend
the night in the continent's

67
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,279
largest rice farming
area before we go up

68
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,532
to the mountains to look
for that lost party.

69
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,075
Rice farming?

70
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,452
I'm so excited!

71
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,996
I haven't had any rice
since I came to this world.

72
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,998
It's been so long, it's weird
to think I used to eat it

73
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,041
every day.

74
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,000
In that case...

75
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,585
I can't wait to have some.

76
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,244
[AIKO] Good job out
there today, everyone!

77
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,831
Fill your bellies and get ready
to work hard again tomorrow!

78
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,123
‐‐Right!
‐‐Right!

79
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,459
[GROUP]
Let's dig in!

80
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,753
[sighs]

81
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,839
Are you feeling okay?

82
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,800
You're not thinking about
Shimizu again, are you?

83
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,093
[AIKO]
Where could he have gone?

84
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,678
It's been a whole week now.

85
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,471
It just doesn't seem right.

86
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,474
Nothing like this has ever
happened with him before.

87
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,519
I should've been keeping
a closer eye on him.

88
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,021
Don't worry. I'm sure he's fine.

89
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,064
Absolutely!

90
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,774
He'll be back before we know it.

91
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:58,775
Thank you!

92
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,987
You're right, worrying about him
isn't going to solve anything.

93
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,029
[YUUKA]
Heh.

94
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,366
[OWNER 08A] I hope you're
enjoying the food this evening.

95
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,826
How is the meal?

96
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,245
Everything's delicious,
as always!

97
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,747
Good, I needed to
hear that tonight.

98
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,417
Hm? Is something wrong?

99
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,753
[OWNER 08A] Unfortunately,
and I hate to disappoint you,

100
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,630
but the last of our
spices were used during

101
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,215
today's dinner prep.

102
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:25,010
Huh? How did a restaurant
come to run out of spices,

103
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,220
if you don't mind my asking?

104
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,014
[OWNER 08A] It sounds like
there's some serious trouble

105
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,725
up in the mountains, and it's
cut the spice traders off

106
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,643
from their usual route.

107
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,312
What trouble?

108
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,356
[OWNER 08A] Rumors say a gang
of monsters suddenly appeared.

109
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,399
And just the other day,

110
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,151
a group of high‐ranking
adventurers made their way

111
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,653
out there and didn't come back.

112
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,947
[AIKO] That's more than
a little concerning.

113
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,157
But thankfully,

114
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:50,076
Somebody else has been sent
here to deal with the problem.

115
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,078
A group of guests
checked in today saying

116
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,539
that they had been asked to
search for the missing party

117
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,459
by the head of the Fuhren
Adventurer's Guild himself.

118
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,209
Oh?

119
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,795
Well, whoever they are,
they must be pretty tough.

120
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,298
[SHEA] How many times
do I have to ask you?

121
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,133
Will you stop excluding
me to retreat into

122
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,551
your own little world?

123
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,637
Do you even hear me, Hajime?

124
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,347
[HAJIME]
Yeah, I hear you.

125
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,723
I just don't wanna see you.

126
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,475
So... Separate rooms.

127
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,936
[SHEA] Aww!
Yue, are you listening to this?

128
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,189
He's being so mean to me! Help!

129
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,690
[YUE]
Bad boy, Hajime.

130
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,734
[HAJIME]
Yeah, yeah.

131
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,863
Did they say what I
thought they just said?

132
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,823
Yeah, and his voice
sounds familiar!

133
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,116
Am I wrong here?

134
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,662
Nagumo?

135
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,875
Nagumo?

136
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,252
Uh... Ms. Aiko?

137
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,046
[gasps]
It is you.

138
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,675
It really is you, isn't it?

139
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,387
I'm so... I'm so glad
you're alive!

140
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,180
Nope, you got the wrong guy.

141
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,682
‐‐Huh?
‐‐Bye.

142
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,308
Wait! Hold on, please.

143
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,185
You may look a little
different than you used to,

144
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,812
but there's no hiding
the fact that you just

145
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,854
said my name!

146
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,731
No. You heard me wrong.

147
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,191
It's, uh...

148
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,025
Oh, right!

149
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,403
It's a regional word
that means "tiny woman!"

150
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,278
Yeah!

151
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,322
[AIKO] Then you were just
being incredibly rude?

152
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,617
Nice try, but no one is that
mean to a stranger immediately!

153
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,703
You can't trick me!
I'm a teacher!

154
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,246
Please!
What happened to you?

155
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,123
Why do you look like that?

156
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,709
Why haven't you come
back to everyone?

157
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,835
Answer me!

158
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,253
Nagumo!

159
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,379
[YUE]
Leave him alone.

160
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,673

327

00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,846
Huh? But I locked it.

into a woman's bedroom

00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,109
Sorry, sorry.

336

[AIKO]
What did you want to discuss?

338
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,288
You're in for a wild ride.

339
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,123
I'm here to tell you
the history of this world

340
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,876
as I've come to understand it.

341
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,836
And after that,
I'll tell you why I'm not

342
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,129
coming with you.

343
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,895
[HAJIME] Just after the
ancient Age of Gods,

344
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,272
the world was plagued by war.

345
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,192
Humans, demons, and the
countless forms of beastman

346
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,486
fought ceaselessly
against each other.

347
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,030
Blood flowed freely.

348
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,699
During those centuries
of war, a group of people

349
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,452
who wanted to stop
it came forward.

350
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,078
The leader of that
group learned something

351
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,164
important about
their god's plan:

352
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,084
He didn't have one.

353
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,295
He was just using his
creations as pawns

354
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,173
in a game of war
for his own amusement.

355
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,008
While this god lurked
in the shadows,

356
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,427
pulling the strings
to cause conflict,

357
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:55,389
heroes came forth, united
in their desire to stop him.

358
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,892
Around that time, they
started calling themselves

359
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,227
"The Liberators."

360
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,896
But their plans fell apart
before they could do any

361
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,815
actual liberating.

362
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,944
Their god declared them
blasphemers, heretics,

363
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,364
enemies of the Church, hell‐bent
on destroying the world,

364
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,325
and turned all of
humanity against them.

365
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,369
The Liberators,
unable to fight the people

366
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,747
they had sworn to protect,
were re‐labeled "Mavericks,"

367
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,709
hunted down,
and taken out one by one.

368
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,670
But a few members did survive.

369
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,964
They got together
and made a new plan.

370
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,258
There was nothing they could
do with their limited power,

371
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,719
so they abandoned the idea of
attacking their god directly.

372
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,055
Instead, they scattered
and built great labyrinths

373
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,765
so they could hide from
a world that didn't

374
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,141
understand them.

375
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,769
In these labyrinths,
they prepared trials.

376
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,564
Whoever overcomes those
trials is granted the powers

377
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,524
of the Maverick
who designed them.

378
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,693
If someone got strong
enough in this way,

379
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,238
they could end this god's
sick game once and for all.

380
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,199
That's what I learned at
the bottom of the abyss.

381
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,451
And that's just about
everything I've got.

382
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,912
Up to you whether
or not you believe me.

383
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,623
I know firsthand it can
be a lot to take in.

384
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,959
So, any questions?

385
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,295
Are you saying that
you're gonna be the one

386
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,922
to do something about
this evil god?

387
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:10,881
Hell no.

388
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,926
I don't give a damn what
happens to this stupid world.

389
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,847
I'm just using the Mavericks
to find a solid way home.

390
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,432
The labyrinths are the key.

391

You can come with us,
if you want.

392

But I have a pretty strong
feeling you wouldn't last long

393
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,107
out there.

394
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,652
[AIKO] Shirasaki never gave
up on you, you know.

395

She wasn't going to
believe you were dead

00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,872
Well, she sent me a letter.

through the labyrinth together.

401
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,129
[HAJIME] Then you should
tell her something.

There's more to worry about
down there than just monsters.

403

She should keep a close eye
on her teammates as well.

407
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,808
So I'll be perfectly clear.

Yes.

One of the magic spells lost
control and happened to hit you.

[HAJIME]
Lost control, huh?

412

told yourselves.

Unfortunately,
that isn't the case.

that spell hit exactly
