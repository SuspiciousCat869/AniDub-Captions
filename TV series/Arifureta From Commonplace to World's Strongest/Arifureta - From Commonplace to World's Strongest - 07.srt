1
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:25,317
[SHEA] Aww. How much longer
am I gonna have to wait?

2
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,529
Seriously, would they
just show up already?

3
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,488

[screaming]

8
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:49,132
If they don't get here soon,
it's gonna be too late!

9
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,394
Come on!

10
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,771
Hurry and save me before
this thing catches me

11
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,107
and I end up as monster food.

12
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:07,818
Here they come!

13
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,863
[SHEA yells]

00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,914
[SHEA grunts]

15
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,225
You're here!
You're finally here!

16
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,369
‐‐[YUE laughs]
‐‐[HAJIME] Yes!

17
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,870
[HAJIME]
We made it to the surface!

18
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,913
[YUE]
Mm‐hmm!

19
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:34,381
[SHEA] I've been waiting for
such a long time!

20
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:37,300
But here you are! Finally!

21
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,721
[HAJIME]
The hell is that?

22
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,597
[YUE]
A bunny girl?

23
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,808
And what'd she say? "Finally"?

24
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,394
Like she's been expecting
us or something?

25
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:51,106
Yeah. She's trouble. Let's go.

26
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,233
[SHEA]
Wait! Don't go!

27
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,777
I need your help!

28
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:56,820
[grunts]

29
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,199
Why would we help
a worthless rabbit?

30
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,666
[SHEA]
I'm begging you!

31
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,127
Please save my family!

32
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,337
[HAJIME]
Your family?

33
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,632
[SHEA whimpers]

34
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,843
Get off him.

35
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,845
No! I can't do that.

36
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,139
If I let go, you'll walk
away and leave me,

37
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,015
won't you?

38
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,433
Well, yeah, pretty much.

39
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,727
I don't see how I'm obligated
to help some bunny

40
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,312
I've never even met before.

41
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,483
[SHEA whines]
Shot down.

42
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,651
Could you really
abandon me like that?

43
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,321
A beautiful young
damsel in distress?

44
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,659
[HAJIME] Someone
thinks highly of herself.

45
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,077
[YUE]
Embarrassing.

46
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,210
[roars]

47
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,878
[SHEA yelps]

48
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,255
That thing.
Did it just roar at me?

49
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,840
[YUE]
Mm‐hmm.

50
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,509
No, wait! Stop!

51
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,843
You'll only get killed.

52
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,970
Let's run away while
we have the chance!

53
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:18,401
You took out a Diheadoar?
Wow! Amazing!

54
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,737
[HAJIME] C'mon, let's get
the hell out of here.

55
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,405
Without the extra baggage!

56
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,699
[SHEA yelps]

57
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,700
Please listen!

58
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,703
I am Shea, eldest daughter
of the Haulia beast tribe,

59
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,206
and we need your help.

60
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,209
If you save my family,
I'll do anything you ask of me!

61
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,337
Anything at all! Please help us!

62
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,472
[SHEA whines]

63
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,309
What's your major malfunction?

64
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,769
Just give up.

65
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:53,728
[SHEA]
I can't.

66
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,982
The future of my whole
race might be at stake.

67
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,316
[HAJIME]
All right, fine.

68
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,571
[SHEA yelps]

69
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,490
That really hurts! Ugh!

70
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,200
Well? Out with it.

71
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,661
What's your sob story?

72
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,748
[SHEA] Thank you so much
for giving me a chance.

73
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,668
Hey! Keep your
snotty‐ass nose off my coat!

74
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,044
That's freaking gross!

75
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,089
You jerk! I can't believe
you hit me again!

76
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,675
I'm a lady.
A beautiful young lady!

77
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,177
[HAJIME] How can you say this
crap with a straight face?

78
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,597
Especially in front of Yue,
who's a hundred times hotter

79
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,806
than you.

80
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,099
[YUE chuckles]

81
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,896
Yeah, well.

82
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,357
She may be pretty, but there's
gotta be at least one area

83
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,276
where I have her beat.

84
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:44,195
[gasps]
Oh, yeah, there totally is!

85
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,530
Look at her chest!

86
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,325
It's as flat as a boy's!

87
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,618
But mine's not.

88
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,829
What's wrong?

89
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,289
Are you hiding your face?

90
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:58,126
Aw, don't worry, I won't
tease you for blushing.

91
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,169
Huh?

92
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,006
Okay, you're mad.

93
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,592
Would it help if I said sorry?

94
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,802
Any last words before you die?

95
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,974
[SHEA]
No! Please don't kill me!

96
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,145
[HAJIME] So your tribe's
got monster trouble.

97
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,773
But why were you exiled
in the first place?

98
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,817
[SHEA] Beastmen aren't supposed
to be able to manipulate mana,

99
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,070
but for some reason, I can.

100
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,948
And on top of that, I can use
a special kind of magic

101
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,699
that only monsters use.

102
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,368
Why's it so special?

103
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,912
[SHEA]
Well, It's called Future Sight.

104
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,289
I see possible futures.

105
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,874
Like, if you make
a certain choice,

106
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,542
then this is what will happen.

107
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,669
You know?

108
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,254
Actually, that's how
I knew I'd meet you.

109
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,966
[gasps]
Please! Will you help us?

110
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:50,261
If you don't, then the
Haulia race is doomed!

111
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,429
[HAJIME]
Not happening.

112
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,395
[SHEA]
Please! Hear me out!

113
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,648
I saw this!
I saw into the future!

114
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,941
You help us!

115
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,652
You save me and my
people from the monsters!

116
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,820
Oh, do I?

117
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,197
And what do I get
for this noble act?

118
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,824
Huh?

119
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,701
[HAJIME]
Well? Nothing, right?

120
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,830
[SHEA] Wait.
You're headed for the Great Tree

121
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,916
in the Haltsina Sea
of Trees, aren't you?

122
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,961
Well, you should know
it's surrounded by fog.

123
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,921
Really thick fog, too.

124
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,590
People get
hopelessly lost in it.

125
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,925
So?

126
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,885
[SHEA]
So, if you had someone with you,

127
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,596
someone who was
a native of the Sea of Trees...

128
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,848
Let's take her.

129
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,435
[HAJIME]
Really?

130
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,395
Having a guide could be helpful.

131
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,233
[SHEA] You're the best!
Thank you so much!

132
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,487
It's okay.

133
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,614
I'm sure you'll warm up
to me eventually.

134
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,332
[RABBIT GIRL 6A]
Look! Look!

135
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,834
I found some fruit.

136
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,127
Don't they look yummy?

137
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,463
Wait! Get back here!

138
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,672
[CAM]
No!

139
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,759
[RABBIT GIRL 6A screams]

140
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,977
[SHEA]
Father, I'm home!

141
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,022
I'm back, and I
brought help with me!

142
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,106
[laughing]

143
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,316
[CAM]
Shea!

144
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,027
[RABBITMEN]
Huh?

145
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,948
[SHEA]
Everyone!

146
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,450
We're saved!

147
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,367
Owie.

148
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,453
[HAJIME] If you and your big
mouth are gonna get in the way,

149
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,872
I guess I'll have
to put you to work.

150
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,165
What do you mean, "work"?

151
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:42,999
[HAJIME]
Don't worry.

152
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,127
It's an easy job, and one
that you'll be perfect for.

153
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:49,214
Acting as bait for
those monsters.

154
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,174
Go get 'em,
you worthless rabbit!

155
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,593
[SHEA]
No!

[RABBITMEN gasp]

160
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,322
So scary!

161
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,074
I can't take it!

162
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,575
I'm fragile, you know,

163
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,411
and you're being awfully
rough with me... ah!

[grunts]

165
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,291
Treat me like the delicate
young lady I am, please?

166
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,505
Because I can use the same
powers monsters can,

167
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:34,050
my fate was to be detested,
and eventually killed,

168
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,468
by the other beastmen.

169
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,682
My father and the
rest of the Haulia tribe

170
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,809
refused to let that happen.

171
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:47,147
In order to protect me, they
left our home of Verbergen

172
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,773
and came to live out here.

173
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,695
But rabbitmen aren't fighters.

174
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,488
We have no way
to protect ourselves

175
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,282
from the dangers of this world.

176

[RABBITMEN snoring]

177
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,564
[SHEA] I never thought it
possible that my people

178
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,816
would know this kind of peace.

179
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,818
Thank you both so much.

180
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,528
Save your thanks.

181
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,030
It's all just part of the deal.

182
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,073
We protect your people,
and in exchange,

183
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,617
you guide us to the tree.

184
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,705
[SHEA] I've never met
anyone like you before.

185
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,790
Someone who could
use monstrous powers

186
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,250
like I can.

187
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,420
It may sound strange,
but I feel a sort of kinship

188
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,546
with you.

189
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,133
Can I ask what the goal
of your journey is?

190
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,885
[HAJIME]
It's simple enough.

191
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:02,305
I'm taking Yue and going home.

192
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,514
That's my goal.

193
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,227
[SHEA]
I've been thinking,

194
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,645
and I made a decision.

195
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,772
I'm going to join you
on your journey.

196

[HAJIME]
No thanks.

Yeah, you'll just hold us back.

We want to get stronger.

Don't tell me you

because of that flower.

Ooh! We can't help it.

217

Listen up, you
crap‐for‐brains rabbits!

If you don't want me to murder
each and every one of you,

226
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,775
then slay a monster for me!

I was gonna freeze to death!

I'm sure Yue won.

Nope!

00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,236
I managed to scratch her face,
so this was my glorious victory!

00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,029
I wish you could've seen it!

You know...

255
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,699
It's not often you meet someone
with both beauty and brawn.

256
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,700
Right.

257
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,328
So, Yue. How'd she do?

258
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,580
[YUE] She's worked hard
to strengthen her body,

00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,125
giving her a monstrous
level of power.

260

Well, damn. Good for you.

00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,586

Please let me come
on your journey.

wanna join us?

be with you, Hajime!

00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,898

Huh?

00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:42,859
[CAM]
'Ey boss.

271
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,237
We hunted down every last
monster we could find.

272
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,989
Whoa. Father?

273
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,615
Your voice is weird.

274
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,492
You seem so different.

275
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,452
That many?

276
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,371
I only said you needed
to bring me one monster.

277
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,790
[CAM] A whole pack of
'em attacked our party,

278
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,542
they had the nerve
to try to kill us,

279
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,419
so we cut the fiends to shreds.

280
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,963
Like you said.
Kill or be killed.

281
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,090
They were annoying,
but their dying screams

282
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,217
filled me with so
much raw pleasure.

283
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,679
Um, Hajime... Question.

284
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,473
What did you teach my people?

285
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,849
How to survive.

286
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,735
That's the Great Tree?

287
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,778
[CAM] It's been dead
since before Verbergen

288
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,697
was established.

289
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,491
But it never rotted away.

290
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,703
It's stood here for ages,
lifeless but unchanging.

291
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,289
[HAJIME] Up there.
It looks like Oscar's ring.

292
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,875
[YUE]
Yes. It's the same design.

293
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:41,876
That settles it.

294
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,212
We found the entrance
to another labyrinth.

295
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,007
[HAJIME]
What's this?

296
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,431
[YUE] This door will open
once more only to those

297
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,517
who possess the four symbols,

298
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,019
the power of regeneration,
and a beacon

299
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,271
formed out of ironclad bonds.

300
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,899
[SHEA]
What's that mumbo jumbo mean?

301
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,567
We need four symbols?

302
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,737
Then maybe those
are the labyrinth relics?

303
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,990
Ah. And that part about
the beacon formed of bonds

304
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,076
might be the fact
that you joined up

305
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,953
with some super‐brave beastmen.

306
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,622
The magic of teamwork!

307
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,958
But the power of regeneration.

308
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,006
I don't think that's
gonna get us through.

309
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,093
[YUE] Hmm. Perhaps if we
clear the other labyrinths,

310
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,011
we'll learn more ancient magic.

311
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,639
And in doing so, we'll gain
the regeneration ability

312
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,224
needed to get in.

313
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,976
[SHEA]
I get it now.

314
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,310
[HAJIME]
What a pain.

315
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,437
Guess we've gotta head to
those other Maverick dungeons

316
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,523
before we do this one.

317
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,234
Hear that?
I can't get inside.

318
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,028
That means I've got to
track down other labyrinths.

319
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,072
Our deal is officially over.

320
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,657
This is where we part ways.

321
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,617
Good luck, I guess.

322
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,869
With what you learned,
you should be able to survive

323
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,997
out here by yourselves now.

324

Nah, just keep training.

That's the best thing
you can do to help.

That way, when I come back,
maybe you'll be useful.

We're gonna keep on training

Am I a monster

[SHEA'S MOM] A white shadow
lurks in the Sea of Trees,

always vanishing

the second before you see it.

It must be a new
type of monster.

342

Something terrifying.

I bet you went out again

Do you want to be a monster?

Of course not.

350
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,436
That would be terrible!

a good thing to be different.

But here's a secret.

There are some things you can do
only because you're different.

Ways that you can
help other people.

Let's take this
worthless rabbit with us.

So those were the
stakes of your duel, huh?

Sadly.

gonna get along with you.

The future isn't absolute,
don't you know that?

Anything can happen!

391
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,885
And I believe that if
I try hard enough,

392
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,596
I can change the future
all by my lonesome.

but they still do.

397
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,399
And I always wonder
if maybe it's because

398
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,943
I didn't do my best.

399
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,238
But from now on, I don't
want to have any regrets.

Yeah, about that...
