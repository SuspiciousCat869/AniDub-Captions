A dragon's only weak point

They say they're

00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,647
[wails]

169
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,398
Now, then.

170
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,775
You must be one of
the dragonborn, yes?

171
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,776
[TIO]
Indeed!

172
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,821
I'm a member of the
esteemed dragonborn race!

173
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,490
Wild circumstances have
led me to this predicament.

174
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,700
I'll tell you everything.

175
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,952
But only if you remove
this foreign object

176
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,871
from my nether regions!

177
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,205
I think not.

178
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,916
[TIO squeals]
I am begging you!

179
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,877
You've pushed me
to the breaking point.

180
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,211
Plus, I'm almost out of mana,

181
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,881
and if I return to my original
form with this inside of me,

182
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,799
it'd be a disaster.

183
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,926
Why are you on this mountain?

184
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,095
[TIO]
I told you, I'll relay my story.

185
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,264
Just remove his sword
from my sheath.

186
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,683
Imagine what it feels like
to have this maniac ram you‐‐

187
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,393
[wails]

188
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,729
You better answer
Yue's questions.

189
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,731
[TIO]
It's going in deeper!

190
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:17,940
Don't force it like that!

191
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,067
This is too much.

192
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,570
It feels like
I'm going to rip apart!

193
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,949
[HAJIME] The dragonborn
are supposedly all dead.

194
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,911
So what's one doing out
here attacking adventurers.

195
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,705
Better start talking fast.

196
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,875
[TIO] No, please, twisting
it makes even harder to bear!

197
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,085
I'll spill my secrets.

198
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,879
When you stop
spearing my backside!

199
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,886
[TIO]
I was manipulated.

200
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:50,640
I was no more than
some horrible villain's tool!

201
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,724
He's the one who told me

202
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,811
to kill that young man
and his companions.

203
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,313
Keep going, ya beast.

204
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,607
[TIO] I left my hidden village
to investigate rumors

205
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,900
that were circulating

206
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:04,445
about travelers who
came from another world.

207
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,697
But on my journey
to the closest town,

208
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,825
I tired and paused for a rest.

209
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,495
A lovely nap on
a mountain ledge.

210
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,747
Naturally I stayed
in my dragon form,

211
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:18,209
as there were vicious
monsters in the vicinity.

212
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,794
While I slumbered in peace,

213
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,046
a man dressed in dark robes
somehow stumbled upon

214
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,299
my resting place and
took advantage of me.

215
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,343
He must have used some
sort of mind‐control magic

216
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:31,806
to steal my freedom and force me
to act out his terrible wishes.

217
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:36,519
The man was an expert
of his wicked craft.

218
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,856
And since he cast his spell over
the course of an entire day,

219
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,567
it was far too strong to resist!

220
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,778
So you're telling me, that you
were in such a deep sleep,

221
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,573
that this idiot was able to
spend a whole day castin' magic,

222
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,534
and you didn't even
know he was there?

223
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,287
[WILL]
I don't believe you!

224
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,247
You're saying
it's not your fault?

225
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:00,168
How convenient that someone
else made you kill my friends!

226
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,087
How are we supposed to know
if you're telling us the truth?

227
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,672
I bet you made
that entire story up

228
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,008
just to save your
worthless hide.

229
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,051
[TIO]
I swear, this is what happened.

230
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,345
The dragonborn
are a proud people.

231
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,431
We'd never stoop to falsehoods.

232
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,182
Liar!

233
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,476
[YUE]
What she says is true.

234
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,311
[WILL]
What proof do you have?

235
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,063
[YUE] The dragonborn
are noble and honest.

236
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:21,898
You heard her.

237
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,525
She put her pride
on the line, right?

238
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,611
That's how I'm sure
she's not lying.

239
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,612
But. Wait!

240
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,779
Besides,

241
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,449
I know what the eyes
of a liar look like,

242
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,034
and hers are pure.

243
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,329
[TIO] To think there
is someone in this age

244
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,624
who understands the way
of the dragonborn.

245
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,251
I am the last surviving vampire.

246
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,628
Three centuries ago,

247
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,838
I was often told to
look to the dragonborn

248
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,674
as models of how
royalty should behave.

249
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,967
[TIO]
Incredible!

250
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,344
We'd received news
in our village

251
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,554
that the vampires
were eradicated.

252
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,349
And, yet, here sits
a princess of their ilk.

253
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,767
Who cares?

254
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,769
It doesn't matter,
you still killed them all!

255
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,812
You can't get away with that!

256
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,689
[TIO] I don't wish to start
some kind of conflict

257
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,608
between our peoples.

258
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,070
That said, it is true that
I did take innocent lives.

259
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,240
But if you order me
to atone for my sins,

260
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,992
then, I will accept
a fitting punishment.

261
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,745
I only ask that you
temporarily postpone it.

262
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:22,750
Until I can stop that dangerous
man and whatever it is he plots.

263
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:26,546
Will you give me the chance
to prevent another tragedy?

264
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,340
Nah. You've caused me more
than enough trouble already.

265
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,134
Do you think I give
a damn about what you want?

266
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,928
It's time for you to die.

267
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:34,971
[TIO]
Seriously?

268
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:35,763
You would take my life

269
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,431
and let that man
get away with evil deeds,

270
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,560
causing unimaginable
disasters to befall humanity?

271
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,686
What kind of fool are you?

272
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,771
Have you know sense of decency‐‐

273
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,648
You're going to kill her?

274
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,902
Well, she's the one
who started it.

275
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,487
She was being controlled,

276
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,739
which means she's not our enemy.

277
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,032
Think about it.

278
00:17:55,074 --> 00:18:00,663
Don't you have a sacred vow
to not take innocent lives.

279
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,081
[TIO]
Apologies for interrupting.

280
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,666
But could you at
least remove that rod

281
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,585
while you decide my fate?

282
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,627
Huh?

283
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:07,837
[TIO]
If you leave it inside me,

284
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,298
I'll die no matter
what you choose.

285
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,757
[HAJIME]
Yeah? How so?

286
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,675
[TIO]
When I transform,

287
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,427
you'll be witness to
a beautiful young woman

288
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:18,598
whose buns have been skewered
by this oversized metal pipe.

289
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,933
Do you think anyone
could survive that?

290
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,018
My mana is running out.

291
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:22,935
I'm not exactly opposed

292
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,645
to this new sensation
I've been introduced to,

293
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,315
but I also don't want it
to be the death of me.

294
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,609
For the love of all that is
good and holy in this world,

295
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,153
‐‐I beg you, pull it out!
‐‐[HAJIME sighs]

296
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,572
Yeah, yeah. Fine.

297
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,741
[TIO screams]

298
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,118
Could you go a little
slower please?

299
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,871
Oh! I'm not used to this.

300
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,457
You're being so rough.

301
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,585
What is... [moans loudly]

302
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,337
What is this feeling?

303
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,506
Oh!! Something is
stirring deep within me.

304
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,799
Yes. Yes.

305
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,468
That's it. Just a little more.

306
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,553
You overgrown lizard!

307
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,640
[TIO squeals]

308
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,732
[TIO] I asked you
to be gentle with me.

309
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,443
And yet, you showed no mercy.

310
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,321
Never have I experienced this.

311
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,075
Oh. You've spared me.

312
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,993
I'm still in discomfort.

313
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:24,121
And a humiliating pain
courses through me.

314
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,916
And yet, it's still such
a sweet sensation.

315
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,209
Okay.

316
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,377
[TIO]
Ahem.

317
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,879
My sincerest apologies.

318
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,674
I belong to the Klarus clan
of the dragonborn.

319
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,509
My name is Tio Klarus.

320
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,927
Let's chat.

321
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,725
[AIKO] An army of monsters
is marching on Ur?

322
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,685
[TIO]
Indeed.

323
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,520
The dark‐robed man
I described intends

324
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,231
to use these creatures
to attack the town.

325
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,817
His army numbers well
into the thousands, I fear.

326
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,611
What? How do we stop them?

327
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,076
[HAJIME] This is more than
just a small army of beasts.

328
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,621
I'm counting 50, no,
make that 60 thousand.

329
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,082
They're already making
their way toward the town.

330
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:12,169
If they keep going at this pace,
they'll arrive in two days time.

331
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,380
Then we have to
go warn everybody.

332
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,589
We can evacuate.

333
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,632
And send for help.

334
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:17,508
Some backup.

335
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,759
[WILL]
Uh, hey.

336
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,595
Maybe Hajime could do
something about this army?

337
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,972
[gasps]

338
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:24,557
Nope.

339
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,641
My only responsibility

340
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,227
is getting Will back
to Fuhren safely.

341
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,228
How am I supposed to do that

342
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,439
if I'm fighting a
bunch of monsters?

343
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,982
Say, Nagumo.

344
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,068
Did you see any sign of the man
in the dark robes with them?

345
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,777
No.

346
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,571
I've kept an eye out
while scanning their ranks,

347
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,282
but I haven't seen anyone
like Tio described.

348
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,659
Oh. I see.

349
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,120
Could you, maybe,
look a bit closer?

350
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,580
Don't want to.

351
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,460
‐‐[HAJIME] See ya.
‐‐[yells]

352
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,170
[AIKO]
Nagumo, wait!

353
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,838
[HAJIME]
I just told you that my only job

354
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,757
is getting him back home alive.

355
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,717
The rest of you can
stay here if you want.

356
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,011
But, then, who's gonna warn
Ur of what's coming?

357
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,554
Yes, good point.

358
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:07,224
Ahem. This overly‐hostile
warrior is right.

359
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,935
Informing the town should
be our highest priority.

360
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:10,728
I can help.

361
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,273
But give me a day of rest,
so I'll recover to full health.

362
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,650
Oh. I see.

363
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,986
Unfortunately, Hajime
took so much out of me

364
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,197
that I can barely
move right now.

365
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,573
[HAJIME growls]

366
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,741
[moans]

367
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,577
That look makes me feel
like filth personified.

368
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,037
How lewd.

369
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,498
I'm starting to think I
should've killed you after all.

370
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,875
[TIO]
Your words puncture my heart,

371
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,544
just as your fists pummeled
the very core of my being.

372
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:39,089
And your weapon penetrated
my most personal areas.

373
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,259
My heart, body, and soul
are brimming with pleasure!

374
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,221
[moans]

375
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,057
[groans]

376
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,434
[TIO giggles]

377
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,644
Such horrid treatment.

378
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,187
Such new sensations.

379
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,105
I feel like I might explode.

380
00:21:55,147 --> 00:22:00,694
[shrieks, giggles]

381
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,491
[AIKO]
Hey! Wait!

382
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,868
We're coming, too!

383
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,215
