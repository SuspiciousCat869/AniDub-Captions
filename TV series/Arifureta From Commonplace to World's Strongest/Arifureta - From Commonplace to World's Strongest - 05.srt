00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,203
[HAJIME] We're supposed to be
at the bottom of a labyrinth.

00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:37,871
What's a bed doing here?

00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,379
Huh?!

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,507
Thank you, Hajime.

00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,468
Come on.
Rise and shine, Princess.

You sexy, blood‐sucking

00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,393
Will you wake the

Yeah, that's what they call me.

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,279
'Bout time you woke up.
Now, you wanna tell‐‐

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,239
[YUE]
You're okay!

[crying]

17
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,576
Don't worry.

18
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,495
It'll take more than some
overgrown snake to kill me.

19
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,349
[HAJIME]
So, where are we?

20
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,685
[YUE] We're inside
the Maverick's Lair.

21
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,729
Finally. All right.

22
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,398
How about you tell
me what I missed.

23
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,567
You collapsed.

24
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,994
After that, the door opened,
revealing this place.

25
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:27,249
I dragged you inside and
lifted you up onto the bed.

26
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,669
It looked like the Holy Water
was starting to take effect,

27
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,088
and my powers were all used up.

28
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,424
Sounds like you saved me again.

29
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,633
I owe you one.

30
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,429
So, Yue...

31
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,555
[YUE]
Hmm?

32
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,391
Tell me.
Why the hell am I naked?

33
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:48,437
You were dirty all over,
so I cleaned you up!

34
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,564
Okay, what's with
the lip‐licking?

35
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,440
[YUE giggles]

36
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,275
I don't trust
that laugh, either.

37
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,277
What'd you do while
I was sleeping?

38
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,404
Stop that!
It's really freaking me out.

39
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,284
[HAJIME] Looks like I've got
somebody's entire wardrobe

40
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,327
to choose from.

41
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,413
So this Maverick
must've been a guy.

42
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,166
This place is huge.
I found more than clothes.

43
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,917
I guess we should do some
exploring once we're

44
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,335
all dressed, then.

45
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,548
So, uh, what kinda look
are you going for there?

46
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,805
It's not my fault
nothing here fits me.

47
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,015
Whatever you say.

48
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,146
That sunlight?

49
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,231
No way. Not down here.

50
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,193
It changes, too.
Turns dark at night.

51
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,402
[HAJIME]
Neat trick.

52
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,339
So there's a freakin'
mansion down here, too?

53
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,674
I looked around a little bit,
but most of the doors

54
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,051
seemed to be locked.

55
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,428
Guards up. We don't know
what's waiting in there.

56
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,900
[HAJIME]
Ooh! Heh.

57
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,527
The water's nice and warm.

58
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,613
Aw, man. How many months
since I had a real bath?

59
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,698
So get in. I'll join you.

60
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,575
I'll take one solo later.

61
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,369
[YUE grumbles]

62
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,385
This one's a bust, too.

63
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,179
You weren't kidding about all
the locked doors in this place.

64
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,014
Let's check the third floor.

65
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,307
Might as well.

66
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,861
Doesn't seem to be
anything else up here.

67
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,404
Just one big room.

68
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,967
That's weird. It looks like
he was waiting for someone.

69
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,556
[HAJIME] This room's probably
the key to finding a route

70
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,099
to the surface.

71
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,642
And we don't have many options

72
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,437
with Transmute not working
on those other rooms.

73
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,898
Yue, be ready to help
if I need it.

74
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,191
Right. Just be careful.

Greetings, my name
is Oscar Orcus,

79
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,580
and I am the man who
built this labyrinth.

80
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:39,417
I congratulate you on
surviving my trials.

81
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,170
I assume the term "Maverick"
is familiar to you?

82
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,755
So you're him.

83
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,758
[OSCAR] I've no doubt you
have a great many questions.

84
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,387
Unfortunately, what you're
seeing is only a recording.

85
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:54,015
So I'm afraid that your
queries must go unanswered.

86
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,935
Instead, I wish to pass
along an important truth.

87
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,188
A truth about the history
of this war‐torn world.

88
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,357
One that inspired myself
and others like me

89
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,151
to stand up and fight for
what we believed was right.

90
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,533
[SHIZUKU]
The 65th floor.

91
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,535
That's right. Here we go again.

92
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,329
The deepest floor anyone's
ever descended to.

93
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,205
Not bad.

94
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,417
Honestly, I was a little
worried when we first set out.

95
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,460
But everyone's gotten so strong.

96
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,254
It's kind of crazy.

97
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,797
You've been working really hard.

98
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,008
How many times have
you leveled up now?

99
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,510
Not as many as
you have, Mister Hero.

[MELD]
Stay sharp, people!

101
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,639
This floor's only
been partially mapped.

102
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,350
We have no idea what
might be waiting for us.

Halt!

105
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,873
No. It can't be.

106
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,250
That monster again?

107
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,211
I thought it died
the last time, though.

108
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,713
It's the Behemoth.

109
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,386
Nobody knows the exact
respawn rate of monsters

110
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,013
here in the labyrinth.

111
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,348
But it is normal for some
creatures to re‐form

112
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,850
after being defeated.

113
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,353
It's coming.
Leave a path open to retreat.

115
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,403
A lot has changed
since the last time.

116
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,572
We're much stronger
than we used to be.

117
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:36,159
Trust me when I say that
thing's got nothing on us.

118
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,535
No one's retreating.

119
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,829
We'll stand our ground
and take that monster out.

120
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,165
I figure we're past
due for a rematch.

Hey, what's up?
Is something wrong?

[gasps] Sorry. You startled me.

It's nothing, really. I'm fine.

I guess I'm just having
a difficult time believing

184
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,381
we really made it this far.

I don't know who you are,

led you to pit yourself

against my labyrinth.

190
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,484
But you fought hard
and came far.

And so, I shall
grant you my power.

You may do with it

I make but one request:

that you not use what
you gain from me for evil.

What's going on?

That's all I have to say.

You'll understand
more soon enough.

What do we do now?

I don't give a crap

about this world or

[YUE]
Mm‐mm.

217
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,146
[YUE] I don't care
about anything else.

218
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,233
This is where I belong.

219
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,028
Anyway, I think I
learned a new spell.

220
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,865
That circle gave me
some kind of ancient magic.

221
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,450
What's it do?

222
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,077
[HAJIME] Apparently, it's
called "creation magic."

223
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,413
With it I can add
energy to raw minerals,

224
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:59,125
giving them special properties
and creating something new.

225
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,502
You're saying you
can make artifacts?

226
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,005
Sure can. Pretty badass, huh?

227
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,882
Oh, wow. Amazing!

228
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,176
You know, you could
learn the spell, too.

229
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,095
Except... I don't know
how to use transmute.

230
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,389
Well, yeah, I guess that's true.

231
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,600
But still, it's ancient
magic, right?

232
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,394
The way I figure,
there's no harm in learning it.

233
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,439
Okay, if that's what you want.

234

[HAJIME yawns]

235

You learn the spell?

236
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,286
Yeah.

237
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,998
I mean, I did, but I'm not
sure I'll be able to use it.

238
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,082
Too bad.

239
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,585
I guess this kind of ancient
magic is more compatible

240
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,421
with some casters
than with others.

241
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,090
In any case,
this place is ours now.

242
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,135
We might as well
ditch the skeleton.

243
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,470
Think we should bury it?

244
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,224
[HAJIME]
Bingo! Found it, Yue.

245
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,854
According to this,
that magic circle can take us

246
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,147
to the surface.

247
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:07,193
Except to connect it, we're
going to need Orcus's ring.

248
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,863
Luckily, that's not a problem.

249
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,907
I grabbed it before
we buried him.

250
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,786
The workshop's stocked.

251
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,622
Apparently, Oscar kept a bunch
of artifacts and materials

252
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,831
in there.

253
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,125
I say we take 'em.
Finders, keepers.

255
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,257
[HAJIME]
So that's how it works, huh?

256
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,841
Make it through
the other labyrinths

257
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,468
and we'll get our hands
on the other forms

258
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,221
of ancient magic
these people possessed.

259
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,557
And you might find
a way to get home, too.

260
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,558
That's right.

261
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,269
So I guess we know
what we've gotta do now.

262
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,688
Time to go conquer
some more labyrinths.

263
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,581
There's even more stuff in here.

264
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,129
Is something wrong?

265
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,299
Well, I was just thinking.

266
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,135
Maybe we should
stay here for a while.

267
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,178
I want to get
back to the surface,

268
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,974
but there are still so many
things we need to learn.

269
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,351
And if we're going to
face the other labyrinths,

270
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,438
we should be as prepared
as we possibly can.

271
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:29,483
I'm fine with anything,
as long as you're there.

272
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,735
Okay, then.

I wanted to bathe alone.

You could at least
cover up a little.

There were lots of
towels back there.

All of me is yours, Hajime.

in being shy.

Forget it, I'm out of here.

I don't think so!

[HAJIME chuckles]

304
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,928
We're fully geared up, and
I've gained all I'll be able to

305
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,181
from eating monster meat.

306
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,682
It took two whole months,

307
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,893
but I think we're as
ready as we're gonna be.

308
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,606
Yue, the weapons and
powers I've got now,

309
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,441
they'll draw attention.

310
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,359
Especially from the Holy Church.

311
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,278
I doubt they'll
be very accepting.

312
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,866
It would be one thing if
it was just them we faced,

313
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,035
but I wouldn't be too
surprised if we had the gods

314
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,536
targeting us, as well.

315
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,499
[HAJIME] It might just
be us against the world.

316
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,709
And honestly, I'm not sure
if we have enough lives

317
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,003
saved up to survive it.

318
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,254
[YUE]
We may not.

319
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:44,261
But if I look out for you,
and if you look out for me,

320
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,514
nobody can stop us. Nobody.

321
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,685
All right. We'll beat
everything and everyone.

322
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,732
And bust out of this
crappy world together.
