00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,432
[HAJIME] Yue, the weapons
and powers I've got now,

2
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,226
they'll draw attention.

3
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,228
Especially from the Holy Church.

4
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,188
I doubt they'll be
very accepting.

5
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,651
It might just be us
against the world.

6
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,903
And honestly, I'm not sure
if we have enough lives

7
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,905
saved up to survive it.

8
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,281
[YUE]
We may not.

9
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,324
[HAJIME chuckles]

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,203
But if I look out for you,

11
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,623
and if you look out for me,
nobody can stop us.

12
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,166
Nobody.

13
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,000
All right.

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,169
We'll beat everything
and everyone.

15
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,132
And bust out of this
crappy world together.

16
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,580
[HAJIME] One seemingly ordinary
day, we suddenly found ourselves

17
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,124
in the world of Tortus,
where we had been summoned

18
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,543
by Ehit, the god of creation.

19
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,713
According to Pope Ishtar, there
are three races of creatures

20
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,674
who inhabit this world.

21
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,844
They are the humans,
the demons, and the beastmen.

22
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,722
For centuries, human and
demon‐kind had been engaged

23
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,726
in a bloody war, with neither
side gaining the advantage.

24
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:08,438
But then, the demons
learned to control monsters,

25
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,857
tipping the scales
in their favor,

26
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,653
and pushing humanity to
the brink of destruction.

27
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,198
To prevent humankind's
fall, Ehit,

28
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,158
worshipped by the
people of this world,

29
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,412
summoned heroes with incredible
power to this kingdom.

30
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,080
[ISHTAR]
On behalf of the entire kingdom,

31
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,832
allow me to say what
an honor it is

32
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,459
to have you brave
heroes here among us.

33
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,550
The people in this kingdom
are in danger of annihilation.

34
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,260
We can't let them die!

35
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:42,013
We were brought here to fight,
and I say that we do it!

36
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,057
No! Amanogawa, you can't!

37
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,350
I understand why
you want to help,

38
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,519
but please think about what
they're asking you to do.

39
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,396
Your lives would be in danger!

40
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,232
I'll fight, too.

41
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,776
I wouldn't want you to
have to go it all alone.

42
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,111
[KOUKI]
Are you sure?

43
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,821
Yeah, count me in.

44
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,073
I don't see what
other option we have.

45
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,408
That's great!

46
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,163
[KAORI] And, um... If Shizuku's
going to fight the demons,

47
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,415
then I'll try to help, too.

48
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,083
[KOUKI]
Thanks, Kaori!

49
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,626
[AIKO]
You can't do this!

50
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,923
[HAJIME] In Tortus, some job
classes are combat‐oriented

51
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,426
and some... aren't.

52
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,345
My classmates were all summoned
with extremely rare jobs

53
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,765
that lent them extraordinary
fighting abilities

54
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,433
and unbelievable power.

55
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,689
But my class, Synergist,
isn't combat‐oriented.

56
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,026
It's more like being this
world's version of a blacksmith.

57
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,570
My status points are
depressingly average.

58
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,785
[HAJIME]
Shirasaki?

59
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,828
It's the middle of the night.

60
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,371
I'm sorry, but‐‐

61
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,415
but I don't want you to
go with us when we train

62
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,083
down in the Labyrinth.

63
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,168
It's just‐‐

64
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,504
I had a terrible
nightmare, and I‐‐

65
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,130
I think something bad'll happen.

66
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,840
[HAJIME]
Hold on. What?

67
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,092
Yes! We were in
a dark place, and...

68
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,804
You wouldn't say anything
when I called to you.

69
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,556
There was just this silence.

70
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,768
Then, after that...

71
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,228
You disappeared.

72
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,815
[HAJIME]
I see.

73
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,317
In that case...

74
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,610
Will you protect me?

75
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,195
[KAORI gasps]

76
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,531
[HAJIME] My Synergist job
is super commonplace,

77
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,784
and unfortunately, not really
well‐suited to combat.

78
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,203
But you're a Priest, Shirasaki.

79
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,454
So then...

80

If I do get hurt,

81
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,250
you can just use your
powers to heal me.

one of my classmates

I don't deserve this!

I was brought to this world
in some crazy turn of events.

Then my classmates betrayed me.

I'm trapped in a metaphorical
and literal pit of despair.

So what next?

I want to survive and go home.

Which makes anything between
me and my goal the enemy.

That's right.

in a confined space.

Sounds like gunpowder.

With enough volume and pressure,

explosions rival the highest
tier of fire magic spells.

And that's how you make bullets.

both crafted from
extremely tough Taur Stone.
