So I guess I came
here after all.

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,208
Well then, what
should I start with?

00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,791
[MAN]
What's with these prices?

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,250
This is a complete rip off!

00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,833
[SHOP OWNER] Do you mind keeping
comments like that to yourself?

00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,833
How exactly is this
a rip off, anyway?

00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:48,708
Are you serious?

00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,250
This is a scam!

Pilocchio, don't you
have any common sense?

13
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,000
Maybe you haven't noticed,

14
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,250
but this is a fair price
in The World right now.

15

And what's with that,

looking up my profile
without even asking?

17
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,125
Anyway, if you've
seen the prices

18
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,416
in all the shops around here,

19
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,583
it's pretty obvious
they're on par with mine.

20
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,916
Wait a second--you're
a newbie, aren't you?

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,541
No way.

22
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,916
Why would you lie
about something like that?

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,166
If you just started,

24
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,041
it's not like you can
buy anything, anyway.

25
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,791
So I guess I can understand
why you'd be upset...

Wait--no, it couldn't be.

Tawaraya?

I'm sure I don't know
of any player called Tawaraya.

[PILOCCHIO]
But the thing on your arm...?

You can call me Tohta.

Well, how do
you explain that?

32

Are you absolutely
certain you're not Tawaraya?

I'm not.

There were some bad
things said about him, but--

Well, it's not me.

36
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,125
Anyway, I was wondering if
I could ask you something.

37
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,791
What is the deal with
all these outrageous prices

I'm seeing
throughout the market?

39
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,250
TaN suddenly fell apart.

40
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,708
Then before we knew it,

41
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,083
we were hit with
massive inflation.

42
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,291
It came out of nowhere?

43
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,583
Pretty much.

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,750
Where did all of
TaN's inventory and funds go?

45
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,416
I really have no idea,

46
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,916
but it probably
all just disappeared.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,291
I get it.

48
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,416
So that's not really
what caused this inflation.

49
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,208
There's some information
on the forum

might have joined.

Probably.

you say that, then?

Naobi didn't quit after all;

disappeared from the game?

them to other players.

what tactic do you
think Tawaraya would use?

114

[ITA]
Well, knowing him,

115
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:07,833
he'd probably try
to keep everything

116
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,750
a little bit cheaper.

117

I'm not a hundred percent sure,

118

but I think
that was Tawaraya.

119
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,083
Anyway, I want him
to acknowledge me.

00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,250
That's why I'm doing things

121
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,250
the way I imagine
he would do them.

122

You gotta take it easy.

123
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,375
I think you should be
a little more sensitive

considering the situation.

If someone loses their account
and they come back as a new PC,

127
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:32,333

if we used their old name?

128
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,875
Probably not.

129
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,791

Why are these so cheap?

130
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:36,750
[WOOL]
Yeah, really.

131
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,958
I can't believe it!

132
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,583
That's because these
are the original prices.

133
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,291
Have a closer look!

134
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,333
We're interested
in selling these.

135
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,916
We're not looking for a lot.

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We don't actually
need them, anyway.

It's always good to
stock up on merchandise,

so I'll definitely buy them.

139

Besides, I think the price
for those weapons

140
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,333
is listed in the TaN manual.

So what is TaN?

147
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,208
Until recently,
they were a guild

who suddenly stops logging in,

where he or she is

where Tabby might be?

Tabby?

Do you know who
we're talking about?

Well, kind of,

but I'm not certain
if she knows about me.

she really is famous!

Okay! Let's go.

Hey, if you
happen to see Tabby,

could you do us
a really big favor

Sure.

Sorry about that.

Oh, right--I'm Tohta.

me all the items and money

183
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,041
[PC 19A] Lately, the

have gone so low

185
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,750
that no one wants
to pay our prices.

186
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:41,083
It seems it's because
of that guy named Tohta.

Speaking of that guy,

00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,833
I saw him loitering
around the shops.

[PC19A]
I don't think so.

00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,041
The prices started going down

after he started chatting
with the remnants of TaN.

It's only temporary.

If it's high in demand,
people will buy it.

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,541
Even if it means
using real money

No buts!

The fact that
we have a monopoly

the prices are so low

00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,291
[GROUP laughs menacingly]

321
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,416
If you have any
kind of proof whatsoever,

322
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,333
please, show it to me.

323
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,666
[CASHMERE] Are we
really gonna do this?

324
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,541
[WOOL] We have to help
people who are in trouble.

325
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,708
That's common sense.

326
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,625
[CASHMERE]
Maybe they're not in trouble.

327
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,166
[WOOL] Ita said they
were gonna have a showdown

328
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,666
with some bad guys.

329
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,958
[CASHMERE] But that has
nothing to do with us.

330
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,500
[WOOL] Come on,
they taught us a lot.

331
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,541
[CASHMERE]
What?

332
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,208
[WOOL]
We're lost.

333
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,083
[CASHMERE]
Are you serious?

334
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,083
[PI]
What should we do?

335
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:28,916
[YATA]
It's me.

336
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,500
I want to speak
to the authorities.

337
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,375
Master Yata?

338
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,083
[PILOCCHIO] We know
you guys are RMTing.

339
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,541
Then, like I said--
show me the evidence.

340
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,791
Before we show you,

341
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,041
promise you're
gonna quit doing it.

342
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,875
[OCHI chuckles]

343
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:45,916
Get 'em.

344
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,958
Why isn't Tohta here?

345
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:49,875
Hold on.

346
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,583
He'll be here soon.

347
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,750
Tohta, huh?

348
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,708
So you are
the remnants of TaN.

349
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,250
Now I see why
you get customers.

350
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,416
Pilocchio!

351
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:12,833
[ITA]
Huh?

352
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,416
[ITA]
It's you guys!

353
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,750
We thought we could help.

354
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,791
Come on, get up already!

355
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,958
This is becoming interesting!

356
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,583
[CASHMERE]
What are we gonna do now?

357
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,791
[ITA]
How should I know?

358
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,166
[WOOL]
Pilo, got any ideas?

359
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,833
I don't know.

360
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,708
Leave the proof
and everything else,

361
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,250
then I think you
should get outta here.

362
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:38,083
I'm afraid you're wrong--
it's time for you to go!

363
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:38,666
[PILOCCHIO]
Tohta!

364
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,583
[ITA]
Tohta!

365
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,125
[OCHI]
What did you say?

366
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,875
[TOHTA] Hasn't anyone told you
that if you break the rules,

367
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:46,708
your account will be
suspended or even deleted?

368
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,625
[OCHI]
Yeah, so what?

369
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,833
A small word of advice:

370
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,375
Items bought with
hard-earned money

371
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,416
have more value
than ones that aren't.

372
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,166
It is you, after all.

373
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,208
Are you forgetting
that there are some PCs

374
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,750
that don't have the time?

375
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,333
The demand is out there,
we're just supplying it.

376
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,041
That is nonsense.

377
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,958
You say you're selling
because people want it,

378
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,208
but in reality, you're no
better than a gangster

379
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,000
selling illegal
drugs to addicts.

380
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,666
Are you stupid?
It's just a game.

381
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,166
If you're moving
around real money,

382
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,083
then you have to understand
it's no longer just a game.

383
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,416
Why don't I teach
you something else?

384
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,250
You're starting to irritate me.

385
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,708
It is so typical of kids
to be irritated by adults.

386
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,208
Just listen.

387
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,416
You don't understand
your customers at all.

388
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,541
[OCHI]
What?

389
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,000
It's obvious that
players tend to buy

390
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,750
the strongest weapons
with real money.

391
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,916
But they usually end up
having a bad time in the game.

392
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,541
That's because
their actual ability

393
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,500
doesn't match the
weapon they choose.

394
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,541
Your business plan is flawed.

395
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,208
You've failed to make
the customer happy.

396
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,583
I don't care, you punk!

397
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,583
[PILOCCHIO]
Tohta!

398
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,833
[WOOL]
No!

399
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,208
[CASHMERE]
Now what are we gonna do?

400
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,625
[OCHI]
Huh?

401
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,791
[SYSTEM ADMIN 19A] Thank you for
your patronage in The World.

402
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,125
I regret to inform you

403
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,541
that by the authority of
the system administrator,

404
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,625
I have been ordered to
confiscate and record

405
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,791
your conversation logs

406
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,916
to check for
suspicious activity.

407
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,041
[SYSTEM ADMIN 19A] We'd like
to speak with you directly,

408
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,333
so you will now be transferred.

409
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,375
Huh?

410
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,833
--What?
--Huh?

411
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,750
[TOHTA] Sorry,
but could you revive me?

412
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,291
Thanks, come again!

413
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,541
It is you, Tawaraya!

414
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,500
It's Tohta.

415
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,208
[TOHTA]
Do you know what's funny?

416
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,708
[PHYLLO]
What is?

417
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,125
[TOHTA] I thought
I'd lost everything

418
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,583
during all that turmoil.

419
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,625
But there were some
things left after all.

420
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,416
[PHYLLO] What kind
of rare items are they?

421
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Well I can say

422
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,583
they're definitely
rare items to me.

423
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,583
I thought I'd leave
after I settled things,

424
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,125
but I think I'll continue
to play for a little while,

425
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,541
at least until I leave this
country to study abroad.

426
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,208
Really?

427
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,708
See ya soon.

428
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,541
[YATA]
I've paid back my debt.

429
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,916
[YATA] I welcome you
back to this world...

430
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,000
...from the
bottom of my heart.

431
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,625
[TOHTA]
Naobi.
