1
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,458
[TABBY]
Shino.

2
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,708
[TABBY]
Do you have a minute?

3
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,375
Of course, but I
was under the impression

4
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,083
that you had quit the game.

5
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,750
After hearing about
what happened to Shino,

6
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,500
I realized I couldn't leave,
so I changed my mind.

7
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:43,916
Anyway,

8
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,958
that's the reason
why I'm still here.

9
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,500
Hey, so what did happen?

10
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:52,750
I don't know anything

11
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,458
aside from the
rumors I've heard.

12
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,333
[TABBY] Those rumors
have been bothering me.

13
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,250
That's why I'm asking you.

14
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,208
Um... Where's Haseo?

15
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,083
Did Haseo say anything?

16
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,791
[PHYLLO]
Why don't you ask him yourself?

17
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,791
He's not gonna talk about it.

18
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,833
At least not with me.

19
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,375
[TABBY]
I hope I didn't bother you.

20
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,875
Sorry.

21
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,250
[PHYLLO] You're the only one
that can be by his side now.

22
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,500
Go and talk to him.

23
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,916
That'll be best.

24
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:12,708
[inaudible]

25
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,208
[inaudible]

26
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:43,416
[inaudible]

27
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,958
Shino.

28
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,041
Why won't you log in?

29
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,041
Why won't you answer
your cell phone?

30
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:10,333
Ovan!

31
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:14,958
Why did you leave us
when we needed you most?!

32
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,125
Where are you?!

33
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,291
It's here--this one.

34
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,500
I've tried three times,

35
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,916
and it's the same sector
I can't crack open.

36
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,208
Master Yata?

37
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,625
Which data is it
that you can't seem to analyze?

38
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,625
If the information
is random to begin with,

39
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,875
there's no way we can
analyze it, anyway.

40
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,833
You're forgetting
our presupposition.

41
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,250
[PI]
If this is random null data,

42
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,125
then Ovan's escape
cannot be explained.

43
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,416
I understand that.

44
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,416
[YATA]
So?

45
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,708
Possibly, there is a
logic in the architecture

46
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,333
that might be unknown to us--

47
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,541
a sort of self-creating anomaly.

48
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,583
[YATA]
Sounds like science fiction.

49
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:23,833
But to be honest,

50
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,166
that kind of data
actually exists here now.

51
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,958
And also...

52
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,333
[YATA]
What?

53
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:33,166
If you're going to use
the term "science fiction",

54
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,708
remember that
online gaming itself

55
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,333
was considered
science fiction in the past.

56
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,375
You've got a point there.

57
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,000
[chuckles]

58
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,875
Well, in any case, we've
discovered an anomalous entity

59
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,916
that no one has come
across here in The World.

60
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,250
Furthermore, we've
confirmed the existence

61
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:55,250
of this entity
within Ovan's PC body.

62
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:59,041
[PI] Then we have to find out
what that entity is all about.

63
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,291
We'll also need to confirm

64
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,625
whether it has anything
to do with the Factor.

65
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,458
[YATA]
Pi?

66
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,791
[PI]
Yes?

67
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,291
[YATA] The outcome
will depend upon your actions.

68
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,333
[PI]
Yes.

69
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,208
Tell me, little one.

70
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:19,916
When was the last time
you saw Shino around here?

71
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,250
That's worrisome.

72
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,625
[TABBY]
There you are!

73
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,666
You were really hard to find.
I looked everywhere.

74
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,250
[TABBY]
Hey...

75
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,958
...what about that Sign?

76
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,791
I heard it appeared
when Shino got killed.

77
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,416
And what if it did?

78
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,708
[TABBY]
You were there... right?

79
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,291
I was.

80
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,041
And I couldn't
do anything--at all.

81
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,875
Not a thing.

82
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,208
[TABBY] Maybe if I'd
contacted you sooner,

83
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,583
it would have
turned out differently.

84
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,166
It wouldn't have
been any different.

85
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,333
[TABBY]
But--

86
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,666
--[phone ringing]
--Just a sec. Hang on.

87
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,208
--[phone ringing]
--I gotta answer my cell phone.

88
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,250
--[phone ringing]
--[TABBY] Okay.

89
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,583
[HASEO]
Shino.

90
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,625
[TABBY gasps]

91
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,333
Haseo...

92
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,791
...what?

93
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,625
What happened to Shino?

94
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,458
Haseo!

95
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,291
What's wrong?

96
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:55,541
[TABBY] There's something
different about you, Phyllo.

97
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,750
[PHYLLO]
So did you see Haseo?

98
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,125
[TABBY]
That's why I came here.

99
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,583
But Phyllo, are you okay?

100
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,791
[PHYLLO]
Actually...

101
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,666
...I'm not doing very well.

102
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,583
[TABBY]
May I stay here?

103
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,958
[PHYLLO]
Certainly.

104
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,416
[TABBY]
Did something happen?

105
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,416
I'm thinking if that
really was Tri-Edge...

106
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,458
...we're in big trouble.

107
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,500
[TABBY gasps]

108
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,458
Did you meet him?

109
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,125
She's late.

110
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,416
[SABURO]
Oh, you are here.

111
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,458
Huh?

112
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,125
It is you, right?

113
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,666
Why'd you come from that way?

114
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,791
I got here early,

115
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,375
so I wandered over
to the Beast Temple.

116
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,333
It's like if you were
to visit Rockefeller Center,

117
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,250
it's not much different
to go further to Times Square.

118
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,458
Anyway, I think
your meeting place

119
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,583
is way too secretive
and a little too far.

120
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,416
You haven't changed.

121
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,583
Well, I guess my
PC body may be different,

122
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,500
but the inside's still the same.

123
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,666
Don't let it fool ya.

124
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,458
[PI] So since you
made it all the way here

125
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,791
using that character,

126
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,166
I can assume you're
accepting my offer?

127
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,250
Yeah! I like this PC.

128
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,666
I wouldn't be very comfortable

129
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,208
if I had to use
my previous character.

130
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,250
But you know--

131
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,500
[PI]
What?

132
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,416
I don't want to go back
into the secret service.

133
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,208
TaN doesn't exist anymore.

134
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,416
That means there's no longer
any secret service, either.

135
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,083
You shouldn't be concerned.

136
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,166
Then could you tell me why?

137
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,208
I'd really like to know

138
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,291
what you are trying
to get me to do

139
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,750
by giving me a
brand new PC body.

140
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,750
If it's the terms of use
you're concerned about,

141
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,125
don't worry, 'cause I'm
not gonna break them.

142
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,000
That sounds dangerous.

143
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,416
I get the feeling this character

144
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,875
has already broken
the rules, hasn't it?

145
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,333
So the question seems to be

146
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:03,875
whether or not you can deal
with that--nothing else.

147
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,458
Alright, I'll be in touch.

148
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,208
Oh, your name.

149
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,750
Are you gonna stick with Saburo?

150
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,375
That I can't give up.

151
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,125
Even though this game
is a different revision

152
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,916
with some changes,
The World remains the same.

153
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,625
I've given it some thought...

154
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:20,916
and I've decided.

155
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,250
[PI]
I don't really get it.

156
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,541
But if you don't mind,
then that's fine with me.

157
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,500
[PI]
What do you think you're doing?

158
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,416
Why'd we even bother
meeting in the dungeon

159
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,083
if we were going to
be seen together here?

160
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,625
Yeah, I guess...

161
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,583
But, I figured if it's
not the secret service,

162
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,875
then there's really no need
for us to sneak around.

163
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,083
[PI] You know what--
What is it you want?

164
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,583
About Tri-Edge...

165
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,666
So you have a connection.

166
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,416
[PI] Maybe I do,
and maybe I don't.

167
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,875
Lately, the rumors that
have been getting people

168
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,500
all hot and bothered
on the forum

169
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,291
have got me a little worried.

170
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,250
To be honest,
I don't even know right now.

171
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,666
Oh, yeah.

172
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,000
Another thing.

173
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,875
Isn't there gonna be
some kind of an event soon?

174
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,916
You mean the
time limited one?

175
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,875
Forest of Pain or something?

176
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,541
[SABURO]
Yeah, that's the one.

177
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,333
Are you guys involved in it?

178
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,291
I don't know who or what
you think that we may be.

179
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,125
But we certainly
do not have the power

180
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,916
to interfere in an event
controlled by the CC Corp.

181
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,875
I wonder.

182
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,541
A girl who dreams
of becoming a singer

183
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,750
could actually live
next to someone

184
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,083
who happens to be a
famous songwriter.

185
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,291
It's possible, you know.

186
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,750
[PI] I told you, I don't
get your metaphors.

187
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:13,791
Oh, well.

188
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,708
Your offer seems
pretty interesting,

189
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,125
so I'll use this character.
Thank you!

190
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,791
Keep in touch, okay?

191
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,916
[HASEO]
Where were you?

192
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,250
[PHYLLO] I'm not a
non-player character.

193
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,208
I have a real life, too.

194
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,375
It's not unusual for me
to leave sometimes--

195
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,416
you know--to feed my cats.

196
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,958
What happened to you?
It's not even bedtime yet.

197
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,708
[HASEO]
Um...

198
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,000
...nevermind. Next time.

199
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,250
Hey?

200
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,083
[PHYLLO]
Hm?

201
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,958
What do you
think about the rumor...

202
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,250
...on the forum?

203
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,583
There are a million rumors.
Which one exactly?

204
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:04,791
Haven't you seen it?

205
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,166
I don't know.
Which one?

206
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,500
The one that says PCs
who are killed by Tri-Edge

207
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,000
can't be revived.

208
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,291
The player in the
real world goes unconscious.

209
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,333
And then they become
a Lost One.

210
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,625
What about Shino?

211
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,666
I wasn't talking about Shino!

212
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,250
You understand?

213
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,750
We should go somewhere else.

214
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,208
Come with me, Haseo.

215
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,750
Why this place?

216
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,583
This is the spot where
I fought with Tri-Edge.

217
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,375
What?

218
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,583
Hold on.

219
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,625
You actually defeated Tri-Edge?

220
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,416
[PHYLLO]
No.

221
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,500
But wait...

222
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,708
I was under the impression

223
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,083
that if you met him,
you'd be killed.

224
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,000
[PHYLLO]
Yes, that's right.

225
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,375
I don't understand.

226
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,333
You're alive. How come?

227
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,375
[PHYLLO]
Haseo?

228
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,083
What?

229
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,666
The truth is,

230
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,291
for some reason,

231
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,708
Tri-Edge didn't find me
a worthy opponent.

232
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,583
[PHYLLO] I don't know why,
but he let me live

233
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,958
and simply disappeared.

234
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,916
Does that kind
of thing really happen?

235
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,041
Didn't I just explain
to you that it did?

236
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,291
Then why did he kill Shino?

237
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,458
Where is she now?

238
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,291
Shino is...

239
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,541
The real Shino is...

240
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,791
...unconscious.

241
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,708
She's in a hospital bed.

242
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,416
[HASEO] The way her
PC died wasn't normal.

243
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,083
I tried calling
her cell right away.

244
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:10,125
[HASEO]
Answer your phone! Come on!

245
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,833
Then I got a phone call.

246
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,541
It was from Shino's mother.

247
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,750
She saw your number
on Shino's call history

248
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,416
and called you back?

249
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,500
[HASEO]
She lives by herself.

250
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,916
Her friends started to
think something was wrong

251
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,958
and called her parents.

252
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,333
It turned out
to be pretty serious.

253
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,125
She...

254
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,166
[PHYLLO]
Huh?

255
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,666
[HASEO] She was alone until
the landlord opened the door,

256
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,458
found her on the ground
and called the ambulance.

257
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,125
All by herself.

258
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,708
If her friends hadn't called--

259
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,791
[PHYLLO]
What did her mother say?

260
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,208
[HASEO]
She said that if I...

261
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,708
...if I knew to call,
I must know something

262
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,333
about why this happened.

263
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,000
Like I was responsible.

264
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,708
[PHYLLO] It must have
been terrible for you.

265
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,416
[HASEO]
But it is my fault.

266
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,916
[PHYLLO]
Haseo.

267
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,291
[HASEO] I told you,
it is my fault!

268
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,708
Because...

269
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,791
...if I just got to the
Cathedral sooner--

270
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,708
[PHYLLO] It wouldn't
have made a difference.

271
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,791
Even worse, you could've
ended up as another victim.

272
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,333
But I w--

273
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,250
If that really was Tri-Edge,

274
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,458
you're definitely
no match for him.

275
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,416
[HASEO] So is this field
special or something?

276
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,000
[PHYLLO] It looks like
a normal field, but...

277
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,916
I can kinda understand
the Lost Grounds,

278
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,125
but right here?

279
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,625
Why would he...

280
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,875
...Tri-Edge...

281
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,291
Why would he come
to an area like this one?

282
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,125
Why were you here, Phyllo?

283
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,416
[PHYLLO]
Huh?

284
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
How come?

285
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,125
I was here by chance.

286
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,416
You're always holding
court in the same place

287
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,208
in the Mac Anu canal area, 

288
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:14,333
and you're telling me
that you came here by chance?

289
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,916
Am I really supposed
to believe that, Phyllo?

290
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,541
Spit it out!

291
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,625
Shino and Ovan...

292
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,916
This is where they
first met each other.

293
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,416
You have to be stronger.
