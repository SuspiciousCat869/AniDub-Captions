00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,291
[BOY A]
Okay, she's gone.

2
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,416
Here we go.

3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,833
[BOY B] But mom says I need
to study for my entrance exams,

4
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,250
so I'm not allowed.

5
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,541
[BOY A]
Don't worry.

6
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,958
She said she wouldn't
be back 'til tonight.

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,708
[BOY B] Fine, but just
for a little while, okay?

8
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:57,791
[BOY A]
All right.

9
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,375
[TABBY] How should
we search for them?

10
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,416
Remember, it's an item

11
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,916
that is not listed
in the specs.

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,250
Hey, I wonder...

13
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,250
...is Shino on a date
with her boyfriend?

14
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,333
Her boyfriend?

15
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,041
Of course she isn't.

16
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,583
Besides, she denied it.

17
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,500
Will ya stop jumping
to so many conclusions?

18
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,458
Okay.

19
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,750
Is that a problem?

20
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,583
Of course not.

21
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,208
It's none of my business.

22
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,458
[TABBY]
Are you jealous?

23
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,708
[HASEO]
Why would I be?

24
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,000
[TABBY] Well, you always
avoid looking at her.

25
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,541
Yeah, so?

26
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,958
A man avoids the gaze
of the woman he adores.

27
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,083
[groans]

28
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,791
[SAKISAKA]
There's no treasure box!

29
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,291
No monsters!

30
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,250
How are we supposed
to find anything here?!

31
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,083
[TABBY] Maybe we'll come
across one on the ground?

32
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,583
You know what?

33
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,166
It's not gonna be that easy
to find any of these things!

34
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,875
Boy, I'd sure like
to see those guys again.

35
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:40,125
Wonderful--just when I was
enjoying some sweet memories.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,041
Guess I'm not that
kind of character.

37
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,125
I think that maybe...

38
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,625
...I should think twice
about coming back here.

39
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,125
Huh?

40
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,625
What the heck is this?

41
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,833
I never learned about these
in my tutoring lessons.

42
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,083
Yeah, what's going on?

43
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,500
I didn't see anything
in the manual

44
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,583
saying there was gonna be
strong monsters here!

45
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,916
That's why I didn't
want to come here

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,125
in the first place.

47
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,500
Are you guys okay?

48
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,333
Uh... yeah.

49
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,625
What a relief!

50
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,833
[BOY A]
Thanks a lot!

51
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,750
Are you boys beginners?

52
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:48,916
Yeah.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,708
We only logged in
just a few minutes ago.

54
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,125
Come on, Yuta, you should say
"thank you" to this nice player.

55
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,750
I don't seem to recall
asking her to help us

56
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,333
in the first place.

57
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,833
And you're not supposed
to call me by my real name.

58
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,250
Oh. I'm sorry.

59
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,750
He wants people
to call him Cashmere.

60
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:05,833
[TABBY]
Cashmere?

61
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,666
That's right.
And he's called Wool.

62
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,458
So you're Cashmere,
and you're Wool.

63
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,916
My name is Tabby.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,375
Very nice to meet you!

65
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,125
--[WOOL laughs]
--[CASHMERE scoffs]

66
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,500
[PHYLLO]
What a rare occasion.

67
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,375
Why don't you sit down?

68
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,958
So I'm assuming
you must have come here

69
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,666
for a reason, correct?

70
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:36,875
Well, to be honest,

71
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,250
I'm not certain
I have a reason, per se.

72
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,791
Is that so?

73
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,750
[TABBY] I think this area
is a little too difficult

74
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,166
for beginners.

75
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,041
[WOOL] Have you
been here long, Tabby?

76
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,000
You could say that!

77
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,125
When I started,

78
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,750
I was a little awkward
and naïve like you guys,

79
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,916
but there were people
who helped me out.

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,875
With their training, I became
the player I am today.

81
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,625
Anyway, I think you're at risk

82
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,333
using that kind of equipment.

83
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,916
You gotta find items
that fit well

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,958
with your character
and skill level.

85
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,666
So let's go shopping!

86
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,791

Yes!

89
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,625
Now you look
totally excellent!

90
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,416
She thinks we look good,
Yuta--uh, Cashmere!

91
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,041
Yeah, well, whatever.

92
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,916
[CASHMERE] Look, I know
you're helping us and all,

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,250
and maybe I shouldn't
say this, but...

94
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,375
What's up?

95
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,875
...are you just
being overly nice,

96
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,041
or do you have some
other agenda with us?

97
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,625
It's too weird.

98
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,916
You only met us
just a few minutes ago.

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,083
Who are you?

100
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,916
And what do you want with us?

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,958
[WOOL]
Hey!

102
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,583
There were these players

103
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,916
who really helped me learn
my way in the game,

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,041
and I just want to do for
you what they did for me.

105
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,500
I'm not that smart,

106
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,458
but I can show you
what they taught me.

107
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,291
Okay!

108
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,791
Let's get going!

109
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,416
But where do
you want us to go?

110
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,875
It's obvious, silly!

111
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:30,041
I'm taking you back--
for revenge!

112
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,416
[PHYLLO] I wonder where he is
and what he's doing?

113
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,916
[KUHN]
Huh?

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,916
[PHYLLO] There was a fellow who
used to come visit me here

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,458
who was a lot like you.

116
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,250
He was a beginner,
and all he'd do

117
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,750
was stand there
with a scowl on his face

118
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,291
and listen without
saying anything.

119
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,458
Kind of difficult at first,
but he was a good kid.

120
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,833
He was a young
Black Adept Rogue.

121
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:56,958
Yes...

122
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,375
All right, I'll show
you first, okay, boys?

123
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,708
Watch and learn!

124
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:15,750
This will be easy!

125
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,416
C'mon! Take that!

126
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,500
So what do you think?

127
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,041
Well, I'm pretty sure
she doesn't know

128
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,625
what the heck she's doing.

129
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,500
Yeah, you're right.

130
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,041
The manual says that
when it comes to monsters

131
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,583
with water attributes,

132
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,750
you have to attack
using a fire component,

133
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,291
not a strike attack.

134
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,750
Maybe if it's like
an Elemental Hit...

135
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,958
...using this...

136
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,666
...and this.

--A dual attack should work!

be in trouble.

00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,833
Whoa...

140
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,000
Don't you know
what an attribute is?

Is this all you got?

you guys just do?

147
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,208
Are you serious?

Wait--there is no way

149
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
you've been playing
this game that long.

150
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,458
You haven't even
read the manual, have you?

151
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,666
With armored monsters,

152
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,958
you have to destroy
the shell to kill them.

153
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,916
Especially when you're
fighting giant crabs

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,458
like that one.

155
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,958
Oh, right!
Of course I know that!

Didn't I tell you already?
Once you break the shell...

[WOOL laughs nervously]

I guess we can't use
tartar sauce and lemon, can we?

[laughing]

160
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,666
What? Oh, no!

161
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,375
Wool, Cashmere, you two start
your attack on the right,

162
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,291
and I'll try to strike
it from the left.

Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

164
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,000
[TABBY]
Listen for my signal!

165
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,458
Three, two, one, go!

166
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,458
What are you doing?
The right! The right!

167
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,791
[WOOL]
This is right!

168
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,208
[TABBY]
That's the left!

169
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,125
[CASHMERE] I don't get it!
I thought you said right!

170
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,875
[TABBY] Yes, I said right!
You're going left!

171
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,708
[CASHMERE] Right from which
perspective? Be specific!

172
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,708
[TABBY] It doesn't matter
where I'm looking from.

173
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,500
Right is right!

174
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,541
I think we're dead.

175
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,500
Where are you going?

176
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,541
There's not much
use in me being here.

177
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,833
Now, remember you were the one
who decided to come visit me.

178
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,125
I... uh...

179
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,083
I've seen more than
a couple of people today

180
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,166
who I haven't seen
in a very long time.

181
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,833
[TABBY giggling]

182
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,583
Really, is that so?

183
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,625
Shino or Sakisaka
could've easily taught them.

184
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,083
But I'm pretty useless.

185
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,083
[PHYLLO] Don't get
so down on yourself.

186
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,750
This is only a game,

187
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,125
so you should just have fun
among your new friends.

188
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,625
Right, boys?

189
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,166
Uh, we're not friends.

190
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,166
We're actually brothers.

191
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,791
I totally thought
you guys were friends!

192
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,166
You're the younger one?

193
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,083
No. It's the other way around.

194
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,291
I'm older.

195
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,083
I've had enough.

196
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,500
I'm quitting this game.

197
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,208
See ya later.

198
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,083
[WOOL]
Cashmere...

199
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,500
Yes, well, it is
only a silly game.

200
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,583
However, this one
shouldn't be dismissed

201
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,166
just like that.

202
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,708
[CASHMERE]
Whatever.

203
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,458
[WOOL]
Hey, wait!

204
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,000
[TABBY]
What should we do?

205
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,625
I don't really
know what's going on,

206
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,166
but it's none of my business,

207
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,166
so I guess I'll be going now.

208
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,500
[PHYLLO] Tabby, why don't
you try once more

209
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,833
to make those two
challenge a quest?

210
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,041
[TABBY]
But I--

211
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,125
[PHYLLO] Don't worry,
there's someone here

212
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,375
who has plenty
of time on his hands.

213
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,083
[PHYLLO] This time, I can almost
guarantee you won't fail.

214
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,416
[laughs nervously]

215
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,750
[KUHN] Okay, Tabby,
Wool and Cashmere,

216
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:54,166
you joined The World to have
fun, but you all lack skill.

217
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,500
Obviously, you two
are beginners.

218
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,875
And you're sort of
an intermediate?

219
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,250
Yup!

220
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,041
I'm actually very busy
with many other things.

221
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,166
So, I'm wondering whether or not

222
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,916
I have the time
or desire to train you

223
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,750
how to be top-notch players.

224
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,500
Or if I should find
something better to do.

225
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,291
Please train us,
Mr... uh...?

226
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh. The name's Kuhn.

227
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:19,916
You know--

228
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
[KUHN]
Yeah?

229
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,791
Can you finish
training us by today--

230
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,166
or maybe by later this evening?

231
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,250
We actually have a bit
of a deadline to meet.

232
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,166
We have to log out
before our parents get home.

233
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,583
If they knew we were here,
they would probably kill us.

234
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,541
You don't have to worry.

235
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,416
If I log out, you can stay.

236
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,250
They don't ever get mad at you.

237
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,041
Yeah, but that's not the point.

238
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,875
That's exactly the point.

239
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,291
Uh, so... anyway...

240
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,583
You're no good
at schoolwork, are you?

241
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:48,625
Huh?

242
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,833
[CASHMERE scoffs]

243
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,416
Hold on a second.

244
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,916
What if I were to make you
a bit of a deal?

245
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,375
You know, I'm actually
a pretty easygoing guy.

246
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,416
Just stick around
for a little while.

247
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,750
I'll teach you
all there is to this game.

248
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,458
--Uh-oh.
--Oh boy.

249
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,416
[CASHMERE]
Whaddya want?!

250
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,625
[KUHN]
I own you!

251
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,666
[CASHMERE]
Cut it out!

252
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,041
[KUHN]
I'm serious!

253
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,791
Hey, what was that
all about, anyway?

254
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,458
My brother...

255
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,208
He's preparing for his
entrance exams for junior high,

256
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,166
and my parents
have decided that

257
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,208
if anything distracts
him from his studies,

258
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,916
he won't be allowed to do it.

259
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,458
They're pretty hard on him.

260
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,250
It's sad, 'cause they
weren't that tough on me.

261
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,375
But since I failed,
my mom's completely changed.

262
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,750
She's gotten
unbelievably strict.

263
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,750
She's become
an education fanatic.

264
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:45,166
There's a lot of expectation
on my brother now.

265
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,791
It's all because of me

266
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:50,208
that my brother is having to
deal with all this pressure.

267
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,833
He really wanted to play,

268
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,666
so we waited for our parents
to go out this afternoon,

269
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,250
and then we logged in secretly.

270
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,333
I hope we don't
get caught doing this.

271
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,083
I see.

272
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,458
Let go of me!

273
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,375
I'd rather be studying than
playing a game like this

274
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,333
with some stupid idiot

275
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,833
--like you!
--Sure thing.

276
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:08,875
[CASHMERE yells]

277
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,583
[KUHN]
Studying, huh?

278
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,041
Well, you're right.

279
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,916
I was never good at studying.

280
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,583
See, I knew it!

281
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:23,458
[KUHN]
But...

282
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,500
Huh?

283
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,333
...you know what?

284
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,291
There are idiots who can
only do well in school.

285
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,583
Sad, but true.

286
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,291
My sister,

287
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,041
she's a little older than me.

288
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:50,583
We've always been totally
different from each other.

289
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,500
She's very smart
and really good at school.

290
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,916
So my parents have
a lot of hope for her.

291
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:03,583
I think it would be kinda nice,
but it must be difficult too.

292
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,666
I mean, I don't
really understand it.

293
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,916
I wonder what
it must be like...

294
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
...for someone
to believe in you.

295
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,250
[WOOL]
I think...

296
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,041
...you really
don't need to wonder.

297
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,916
What are you talking about?

298
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,291
You should already know

299
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,250
what it feels like to have
someone believe in you.

300
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,458
[WOOL] We may have
said some rude things,

301
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,875
but we're depending on you.

302
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,083
I know that you really care.

303
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,958
I'm sure that your other friends
would say the same thing, too.

304
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,250
[KUHN]
Hey!

305
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,500
We're going!

306
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,208
Okay!

307
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,125
What do I do?

308
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,750
What am I supposed to do?

309
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,416
I wonder.

310
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,250
Y'know, I really
hate stupid people

311
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,750
who don't know how to study.

312
00:16:58,833 --> 00:16:59,916
If you just stay calm,

313
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,666
everything is
gonna be all right!

314
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,833
Okay.

315

All right,

You're not teaching us right.

I don't really
know what to tell you

except maybe... try harder!

00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,333
Okay.

325
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,625
[KUHN groans]

326
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,250
You see?

327
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,875
That's part of the problem!

328
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:49,541
You!

329
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,875
Enough excuses!

330
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,041
You!

331
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,791
For once, try voicing
your own opinion!

332
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,291
And you, too!

333
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,250
Merely being enthusiastic
is a waste of time and energy!

334
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,916
[KUHN] Well, we're
running out of time,

335
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,750
so let's get this one
out of the way

336
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,958
before your mom
and dad come home.

337
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,000
What?

338
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,083
A little revenge.

339
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,291
[TABBY giggles]

340
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,291
Huh?

341
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,416
I think this is it.

342
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,375
This is the place where
we were beaten, isn't it?

343
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,416
Look out!

344
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,250
[CASHMERE]
Man, this thing's huge!

345
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,833
[KUHN]
Tabby, don't do anything.

346
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,041
Why?

347
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,166
Let those two
take care of it.

348
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,416
[TABBY]
But--

349
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
It won't mean anything
if you try to help them.

350
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,083
I'm sure we'll
be fine this time.

351
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,125
Thanks, though.

352
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,250
Don't be ridiculous!

353
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,250
We can.

354
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,500
We can do it!

355
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,916
Cashmere, I want you
to take him from the right.

356
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,083
I'll take the other side.

357
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:10,625
While I'm distracting him,
you finish him off.

358
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,625
Let's do this!

359
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,291
Hey, you can't
just tell me what to do!

360
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,250
Look, he's in trouble!

361
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,416
Help him out!

362
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,416
You have to do something.

363
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,083
[TABBY] Kuhn! We have to
help them or else--

364
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,791
They're fine.

365
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,750
Hey, are you just a big
coward who's all talk?

366
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,708
Or are you gonna
help your brother?

367
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,416
It's true.

368
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,833
You're an idiot
who can't even study well.

369
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,500
I had you pegged.

370
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,750
Are you just gonna stand there?

371
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,375
Even though your brother
risked punishment

372
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,833
by secretly letting
you play the game?

373
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,791
Well you're just a
little brat, aren't you?

374
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,958
Yuta!

375

Don't forget,
big bro, it's Cashmere!

Lookin' good,
Wool and Cashmere!

377
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,916
All right then,

I think it's your
turn now, Tabby!

Huh?

380

In a critical
situation like this,

381
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,500
the one thing that's
needed above all else?

382
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,666
Um...

00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,041
Um, uh...

384
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,791
A positive attitude
to overcome the crisis at hand!

I think that's your cue.

Yeah!

Okay!

Now do exactly as I tell you!

Once the timing is right,

use your Rengeki at once!

...that we can really do it?

Well, that's that.

enjoyed yourself quite a bit,

Sure.

is what those two
are up to right now.

Who knows?

00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,333
Hanging out with
two complete beginners...

...it was actually kind of fun!

off as a beginner.

Yeah.

I guess you're right.

strange one, isn't he?

...tell me what
your plans are now.

I don't know.

00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:02,791
I see.

422
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:06,208
But, I'm gonna stick
around for a little while.

423
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,000
You never know, do you?

424
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,125
Maybe there's something
here that even I can do.

425

Ah, that reminds me, Tabby.

[PHYLLO]
You dropped this.

428

be needing it sometime...

00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,125
...right?
