1
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,875
It's nothing, really.

2
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,458
I know I can still do this.

3
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,916
[PI]
How does it look?

4
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,916
[YATA] The data in the PC body
itself is relatively normal.

5
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,416
However, most of the data in
his left arm is black boxed.

6
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,375
I've never seen
anything like it.

7
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,083
[PI]
Is it beyond your reach?

8
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,500
[YATA] I hope you're not
underestimating me.

9
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,083
[PI]
I didn't mean to.

10
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,291
If there is something inside,

11
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,791
I guarantee we'll find it.

12
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,208
There isn't a box
that can't be opened.

13
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,208
[PHYLLO] So, what do
you want to do?

14
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,375
[HASEO]
I don't know.

15
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:02,750
You know, I never thought
Ovan would disappear.

16
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,541
[PHYLLO]
You're such a child.

17
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,875
[HASEO]
Why?

18
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,791
[PHYLLO] Yesterday is like
today is like tomorrow.

19
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,583
Did you honestly think
it would last forever?

20
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,583
[HASEO]
It's not like that.

21
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,083
It's just weird.

22
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:18,000
Ovan may never return again.

23
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,083
What makes you
think that's the case?

24
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,833
Well, this is only a game.

25
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,041
And there's a million
other online games.

26
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:27,000
With things the way they are...

27
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,250
I mean, why would he
even wanna come back?

28
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,541
But Shino's waiting
for him, isn't she?

29
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,375
Yeah, she is.

30
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,958
But only because
she believes in Ovan.

31
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,166
Well then,
what about you, Haseo?

32
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,875
Are you saying that
you don't believe in Ovan?

33
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,583
It isn't whether
I believe in him or not.

34
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,833
I really don't
know Ovan that well.

35
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:52,041
I wonder if there's any reason
for me to stick around here.

36
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,666
[PHYLLO]
What do you mean?

37
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,583
[HASEO]
Well, I mean Ovan's gone.

38
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,416
So, the only reason
you were playing this game

39
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,416
was to please
that eccentric man?

40
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,666
I dunno.

41
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,500
Then why don't you start
playing for your friends

42
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,791
that are still in
the game right now?

43
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,125
Please calm down, Teacher!

44
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,583
[SAKISAKA] We didn't
know anything, did we?

45
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,916
What do you mean?

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,791
[SAKISAKA]
About Ovan.

47
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,958
He's a pretty mysterious guy.

48
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,000
Come on Teacher,
if you didn't know anything,

49
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,416
how am I supposed to?

50
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,333
[SAKISAKA]
You know...

51
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,583
What?

52
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,458
[SAKISAKA] What do you
think about all this?

53
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,458
What do you mean?

54
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,541
Are you talking
about our @HOME?

55
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,833
No, stupid. I mean the
Twilight Brigade itself.

56
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,833
There's no reason for the
guild anymore, don't you agree?

57
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,166
No reason?

58
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,875
[SAKISAKA] It was
created in order to find

59
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,625
the Key of the Twilight.

60
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:46,250
Didn't Shino tell you?

61
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,291
She said rather than
having to e-mail each other

62
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,791
each time we logged on,

63
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,916
it would be easier to play
if we were in the same guild.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,583
I figured if I hung out with
someone as cool as Shino is,

65
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,833
the whole game
would be way more fun.

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,416
I'm gonna quit.

67
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,625
[TABBY]
Why?

68
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:07,416
Shino has Haseo, and
Ovan's not coming back.

69
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,250
If the Key of the Twilight
doesn't exist,

70
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:13,291
there's no reason
for this guild.

71
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,416
But maybe it does exist.

72
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,208
[SAKISAKA]
Even Shino said it doesn't.

73
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,333
But it's supposed
to be a game, isn't it?

74
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,750
That's true,
but no matter what,

75
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,041
there's always supposed to
be an objective to a game.

76
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:28,083
I'm sorry, but the Key of the
Twilight is just different.

77
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,750
[TABBY]
Really?

78
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,458
Rather than getting
then losing hope

79
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,291
over and over again,
don't you think it's better

80
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,916
to do something different
and have fun?

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,250
It's pointless to force yourself
to play a stupid game like this.

82
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,291
I'm not forcing!

83
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,750
[SAKISAKA]
Ha! That attitude.

84
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,125
You are forcing yourself,
aren't you?

85
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,541
Oh, stop it!

86
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,250
Well, I'm outta here.

87
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,666
Come visit any time.

88
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,916
It's not like I'm in any hurry
to be leaving this game.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,625
Yeah. I'll see ya later.

90
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,791
You here for
his life advice, too?

91
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,333
I'm just killing time.

92
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,791
Huh?

93
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,416
Anyway...

94
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,791
So tell me...

95
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,500
...what's up with the Brigade?

96
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,791
[HASEO]
Same old.

97
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:28,625
Ovan still hasn't
made an appearance yet?

98
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,500
Keep an eye on Shino for me.

99
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,000
She's fragile. If her
weak points are pushed,

100
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,708
she might break.

101
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:36,958
Look after her.

102
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,541
You're telling me that, too?

103
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,625
Ovan.

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,666
Hi, Haseo.

105
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,916
Bset said she was
worried about you.

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,250
I see.

107
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,916
You know...

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,291
It's just that...

109
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,083
...you don't seem
very well today.

110
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,500
Why don't you
go ahead and log out?

111
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,916
Now is definitely
not the time to run away,

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,916
and logging out is certainly
not going to bring Ovan back.

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,625
I'm okay.

114
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,291
[HASEO]
Run away from what?

115
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,875
[SHINO]
I wonder...

116
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,833
[HASEO]
Hey, um...

117
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,750
I noticed you must be
tired or something...

118
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,875
Are you sleeping okay?

119
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,916
[SHINO]
I guess.

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,916
[HASEO] Um, well,
you know if you're ever

121
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,416
worried about something,

122
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,500
or if you ever need
someone to talk to...

123
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,500
I feel like...

124
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:23,083
...like I need to be here
to support the Brigade.

125
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,041
But with Sakisaka acting the
way he is and everything else,

126
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,666
it's getting to be
too much for me.

127
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,541
Shino, I think you're
better off ignoring

128
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,708
most of what comes out
of Sakisaka's mouth.

129
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,083
But I--

130
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,333
I can take care
of things now.

131
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,416
That's very nice of you...

132
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,791
Haseo.

133
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,916
[BSET] Ovan seemed like he was
bound to do something great.

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,458
Well, I guess he did present

135
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,958
that sort of
atmosphere about him.

136
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,083
Exactly.

137
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:08,250
I think that's why
I expected so much.

138
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,666
You know, I realized...

139
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,916
[PHYLLO]
Huh?

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,791
[BSET]
...what my feelings were.

141
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,083
The only reason
I stayed in the game

142
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,583
was so I could be near Ovan.

143
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,750
Tell me, will Ovan
be returning?

144
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,958
Why are you asking me that?

145
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,458
[BSET]
You know, don't you?

146
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,416
[PHYLLO chuckles]

147
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,041
[BSET]
Besides, Gord left.

148
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,000
I think I should quit, too.

149
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,958
[PHYLLO]
I won't stop you.

150
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,541
[BSET]
Thanks a lot!

151
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:44,083
[PHYLLO] If that's what you
decided, I can't hold you back.

152
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,166
[BSET]
I guess so, but...

153
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,875
...I only wanted
to see Ovan again...

154
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,791
...just one more time
before I go.

155
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,416
Yo!

156
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,916
I'm really sorry
for being late.

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,250
[SAKISAKA]
So, what's all this about?

158
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,166
I think we should
pick up where we left off

159
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,041
and start searching for the
Key of the Twilight again.

160

00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,375
I don't know about that.

320
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,416
But you guys are
almost always together.

321
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,666
No, we're not.

322
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,083
Admit it.

323
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,416
I always see you
looking fondly at Shino.

324
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,083
What exactly
are you suggesting?

325
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,375
I just think it isn't fair.

326
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,666
Well, you're always
hanging out with Sakisaka,

327
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,041
aren't you?

328
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,583
Yeah, but it's
not because I wanna be.

329
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,750
Wait, what does that mean?

330
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,416
I'm not telling!

331
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,875
I don't expect you to
understand the way I feel.

332
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,416
I really don't
want to know.

333
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,166
You would be satisfied
if I was with Sakisaka,

334
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,375
wouldn't you?

335
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,750
Whatever, I didn't
even say that.

336
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,125
[ringing noise]

337
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,458
[SAKISAKA]
What's going on?

338
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,958
[TABBY] I'm gonna
leave the Brigade, too.

339
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,916
Whoa, hey!

340
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,125
Are you sure?

341
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,916
I have more fun
hanging out with you anyway!

342
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,583
[SAKISAKA]
I see.

343
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,708
Sorry.

344
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,041
Teacher, that's
so not like you.

345
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,083
Hey, we should practice
our Rengeki attack

346
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,750
just like we used to.

347
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:23,708
I don't really feel like it
right now, but why not?

348
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,250
I'm perplexed that we both
ended up leaving the Brigade...

349
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,458
...and I'm surprised that
we're still together!

350
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,166
[TABBY] I haven't heard
that in a while,

351
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,833
the Sakisaka catchphrase!

352
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,416
[SAKISAKA laughs]

353
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,541
[SAKISAKA]
Well, ya know.

354
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,041
Thanks... for the e-mail.

355
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,583
Yeah.

356
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:07,500
[SHINO] I'm sorry I left you
alone at such a difficult time.

357
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,583
It doesn't matter, I'm fine.

358
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,333
[SHINO]
I've made a decision.

359
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,666
I'm not like her.

360
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,125
Aura lost hope for this world

361
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,125
and decided that
she had to run away.

362
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,583
But Shino...

363
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,041
...what happened?

364
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,291
Oh, this?

365
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,791
This must be me expressing
my determination.

366
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,250
I've decided that today

367
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,083
I'm going to disband
the Twilight Brigade.

368
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,083
Are you allowed to do that?

369
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,250
Even if there is no guild.

370
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,916
Even if I'm the only
one that's left.

371
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,583
I can and I will wait
until Ovan finally does return.

372
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,416
Don't say that
you're only one.

373
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,083
I'm here...

374
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,375
...and I'll wait with you.

375
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,083
Thank you, Haseo.

376
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,291
[HASEO]
You don't need--

377
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,750
I know--I don't need
to thank you now, do I?

378
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,583
As long as you've got
that down, it's all good.
