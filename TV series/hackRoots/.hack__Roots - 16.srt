[TAIHAKU] I'm sure we've
met before, haven't we?

00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,291
[OVAN]
No, we haven't.

3
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,708
But then again,
there isn't anyone

4
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,750
who doesn't know
of Taihaku from Icolo.

Shino!

Shino!

00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,666
Shino, hang in there!

00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:41,541
Talk to me...

00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,291
Hey! Shino!

What is this?

What the heck is this?!

[PC 16A]
Hey, are you going?

26
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,583
[PC 16B] I told you,
I have no interest

27
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:18,083
in going to a pointless
official event.

28
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,541
Did he say...

29
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,916
...official event?

30
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,250
[PC 16C] But I heard
if you drop out once,

31
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,916
you can't get back in.
What's that all about?

32
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,875
[PC 16A] That doesn't
sound like an event.

33
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,958
[TABBY]
Oh! Uh...

34
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,791
Hey! Huh?

35
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,500
Hey, you're that girl.
From the other day.

36
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,291
Tell me about
this official event!

37
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,541
You mean the Forest of Pain?

38
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,250
That's what it's called?

39
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,041
I'm surprised you didn't
get an e-mail notice for it.

40
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,291
I dunno what it is,

41
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,875
but there are players
who have already entered

42
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,375
and are talking
about it on the forum.

43
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,416
Oh.

44
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,875
My mind's been occupied

45
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,166
by lots of other
things these days.

46
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,708
[KUHN]
It's a week long.

47
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,291
During that time, you're
supposed to do something

48
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,458
at the deepest
area of the field.

49
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,250
[TABBY]
Do what, exactly?

50
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,875
[KUHN] I dunno.
Only those who reach that point

51
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,208
will find out.

52
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,500
[TABBY]
So no one knows yet...

53
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,958
[KUHN] The enemies
are unusually strong.

54
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,541
So far, no one
has finished it yet.

55
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,041
In the forum, some people
have been saying

56
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,916
it's impossible to finish.

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,916
Whoa.

58
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,458
Why don't you
read about it yourself?

59
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,916
I gotta get going.

60
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,583
I'm busy trying
to set up a new guild,

61
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,916
and I've gotta back to it.

62
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,625
Oh! I'm sorry.

63
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,583
I see.

64
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,625
So...

65
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,250
Kuhn is setting up a new guild.

66
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,750
[PHYLLO]
Ah, you came.

67
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,791
I just wanna
ask you something.

68
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
[PHYLLO]
About Shino and the guy?

69
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:17,250
Yeah, I came here
to ask you about Tri-Edge.

70
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,333
[PHYLLO]
What about him?

71
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,958
I want to meet him.

72
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,541
[PHYLLO] You know,
you can't just meet him

73
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,458
because you want to.

74
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,208
[HASEO] Tell me about
the time you met him.

75
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,083
Because if he appeared
somewhere other than

76
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,291
in the Lost Grounds
where those Signs are,

77
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,750
something must be up.

78
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,166
That doesn't change anything.

79
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,833
Please, Phyllo.

80
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,083
[PHYLLO]
Haseo...

81
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,916
I think you really need
to forget about Tri-Edge.

82
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,333
How could I forget
when things are like this!

83
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,750
Shino's still unconscious
in the real world, you know.

84
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,500
I'm aware of that.

85
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,666
The doctors have no
idea why she lost consciousness.

86
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,041
You visited her?

87
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,083
[HASEO] And because
they don't know the cause,

88
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,750
they don't know
how to treat her.

89
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:08,041
That's why I need to
track down Tri-Edge right now.

90
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,541
I understand,

91
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,208
but the answer's no.

92
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,875
Which one of them would you
like Saburo to follow?

93
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,000
[YATA]
Who is the real one?

94
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,916
They both joined
at the same time.

95
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,291
[PI]
Haseo.

96
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,583
Tabby.

97
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,750
Neither of them have
enormous amounts of data

98
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:58,916
like Ovan.

99
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,458
And earlier?

100
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,250
Anything strange about them
when you were with TaN?

101
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,875
No. I would have
said something.

102
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,458
[YATA] I know you
reported everything.

103
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:13,791
Even then, you never failed
to catch the small details.

104
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,416
However...

105
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,583
Tabby, for one, has had
contact with the unknown.

106
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,291
Haseo was there, too, though.

107
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,875
[YATA]
Well, we'll leave Haseo alone

108
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,833
for a little while longer.

109
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,750
If he manages to contact
Tri-Edge on his own,

110
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:36,041
there's no doubt
it'll be very interesting.

111
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,750
For now, I'll let you decide
how to move the pieces.

112
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,458
[PI]
You can count on me.

113
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,791
[PI]
What are you doing?

114
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,708
Hello?

115
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,416
So you're here.

116
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,750
[PI] I came exactly
when I said I'd be here.

117
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,291
This is actually a
really nice place, isn't it?

118
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:26,208
Don't you think it'd feel good
to sleep in a place like this?

119
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,208
[PI]
A nice place?

120
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,541
Is it really necessary
for us to meet here?

121
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,333
[PI] I just don't
want to meet in town.

122
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,875
Even though TaN isn't
even around anymore?

123
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,458
[PI]
Did you read my e-mail?

124
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,625
I did.

125
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,708
You mentioned the beast girl.

126
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,083
But it's strange.

127
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,041
How come?

128
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,375
[SABURO]
There's more going on

129
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,208
with the Black Adept Rogue
kid, don't you think?

130
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,833
You really should consider
just following orders.

131
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,916
Maybe quit thinking
so much and do as I ask.

132
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,708
[SABURO] But the other kid
seems so much more interesting.

133
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,916
It's as if my older brother
stole my favorite snack

134
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,083
that I'd been saving
to enjoy later.

135
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,250
[PI]
I don't get it.

136
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,875
But be sure to make contact.

137
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,000
Contact only?

138
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:09,916
[PI]
Right.

139
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,541
If you can do that properly,

140
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,416
I'll let you know
what to do next.

141
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,541
[SABURO]
Okay.

142
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,166
I hope she understands me.

143
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,291
[HASEO] There has
to be a Sign somewhere.

144
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,291
I need to find it.

145
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,958
[TABBY] I heard the
Forest of Pain was started

146
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,916
in order to find someone
to defeat Tri-Edge.

147
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,416
[PHYLLO]
What do you mean?

148
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,000
[TABBY] Apparently the CC Corp
is going to ask the winner

149
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,541
to take him out.

150
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,750
It's kinda like a competition
between the players,

151
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,250
and the prize is
a chance to fight Tri-Edge.

152
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,291
[HASEO]
For real?

153
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,583
Sorry, but that
simply isn't true.

154
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,291
If they wanted
to remove Tri-Edge,

155
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,500
all they would have to do
is terminate his account

156
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,958
or delete his character data.

157
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,458
[TABBY]
Oh, I see.

158
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,291
That's why it's a lie.

159
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,958
Don't let the rumors
get the better of you.

160
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,791
[HASEO] C'mon, why don't
you just tell me already?

161
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,000
What do you
want him to tell you?

162
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,291
[HASEO]
Mind your own business.

163
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,458
Don't talk to me
like that, Haseo.

164
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,166
[HASEO] It has
nothing to do with you.

165
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,500
What do you mean it has
nothing to do with me?

166
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,333
What the heck do you know?

167
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:26,083
I care about Shino.
I wanna do something, too.

168
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,083
There's really nothing
you can do here.

169
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,583
So don't bother
yourself with Shino,

170
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,458
'cause it's none
of your business.

171
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,916
[PHYLLO]
Don't say that!

172
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,125
Come with me.

173
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,583
I already came
here to look.

174
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,083
So is there something
here after all?

175
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,583
With the way
you are right now,

176
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,625
it won't do any good
for you to meet Tri-Edge.

177
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,458
You're mistaken
if you think he'll care

178
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,583
even a bit about what you say.

179
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,125
What do you mean by that?

180
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,083
He's completely unpredictable.

181
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,500
He'll attack you first
without saying a single word.

182
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,541
[HASEO] You ran away
from him, didn't you?

183
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,750
Personally, I don't
know of any players

184
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,583
who could defeat Tri-Edge.

185
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,750
Well we won't know until I try.

186
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,083
Fool!

187
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,833
But I have to try.

188
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,166
[PHYLLO]
If you try and fail,

189
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,958
you'll end up
becoming a Lost One.

190
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,250
The risk is too high.

191
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,041
But he spared you.
Isn't that right, Phyllo?

192
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,500
[PHYLLO]
Well he might not spare you.

193
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,333
Please don't start a fight.

194
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,000
Come on, let's
get on with it, please!

195
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,875
Haseo!

196
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,916
[PHYLLO] How can you
possibly match Tri-Edge

197
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,583
if you can't even
begin to stand up

198
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,833
against a
Harvest Cleric's attack?

199
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:18,958
[HASEO]
Uh, I...

200
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,416
[PHYLLO]
Don't you see now?

201
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,833
You're dead!

202
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:26,833
Come on!

203
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,333
I'm the only survivor.

204
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,833
As far as we know,
I'm the only one

205
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,000
who has gone up against him

206
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,291
and lived to tell
about his true strength.

207
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,083
Yeah, so what?

208
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,000
[PHYLLO]
Don't you want to help Shino?

209
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,416
You're gonna regret this.

210
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,625
Watch your mouth,

211
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,125
or I'll make you eat
your words, little boy.

212
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,583
Is that all you got?

213
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,708
Shut your mouth!

214
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,375
[PHYLLO chuckles]

215
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,625
[PHYLLO] It's not like I
don't understand how you feel.

216
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,250
But what happened to Shino
is not your fault.

217
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,666
But it is my fault.

218
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,166
[PHYLLO]
Don't make me repeat myself.

219
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,083
You're a child
who just won't listen.

220
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,291
You can't see
anything around you.

221
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,333
Both of you please stop it!

222
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,458
[YATA]
So there is a survivor.

223
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,041
Well, Phyllo,

224
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,416
What is your connection to Ovan?

225
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,833
[PHYLLO]
Do you get it now?

226
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,000
If you meet him,

227
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,916
you'll end up the same
as everyone else.

228
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,500
I'm not gonna give up.

229
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,500
Even if it means dying.

230
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:57,833
You listen to me!

231
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:58,916
Talking about death

232
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,333
is not something
you should take lightly!

233
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,375
But I told her...

234
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,041
...I can take care
of things now.

235
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,750
That's very nice of you,

236
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,083
Haseo.

237
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,125
I have to do something.

238
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,750
[PHYLLO]
Do something?

239
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:19,125
You can't do anything with
your current skill and strength.

240
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,708
You better go cool off.

241
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,125
Haseo!

242
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,833
[PHYLLO]
What's the matter?

243
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,750
Phyllo, that's enough now.

244
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,916
You should let Haseo
do what he wants.

245
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,708
You don't need
to speak for me.

246
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,291
Tabby.

247
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,333
I'm sure Haseo is
capable of doing it.

248
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,375
[PHYLLO]
If he can't even take me on,

249
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,750
how can he possibly--

250
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:50,541
Even so, violence can't
be a solution to everything.

251
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,916
But in this case,
I'm afraid it is.

252
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,791
[HASEO]
Forget it.

253
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,958
I understand what
you're trying to get at.

254
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,750
I just need to become stronger.

255
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,166
I can't tell if they're
actually friends or not.

256
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,666
I'm sorry about earlier.

257
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,750
[PHYLLO]
What for?

258
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,791
I think I might've
gotten in the way.

259
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,500
[PHYLLO] Didn't you
do it because you thought

260
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,416
it was the right thing to do?

261
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,416
I couldn't just stand by.

262
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,125
Now if only Haseo
would stop thinking

263
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,416
he can do everything
all by himself...

264
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,583
I hope things will become
a lot clearer for him.

265
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,375
[TABBY]
What? Sorry.

266
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,791
I think my system is
lagging just a little bit.

267
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:43,958
[PHYLLO]
Nevermind.

268
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,666
This is nothin'.

269
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,083
Let's go back.

270
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,958
They're too strong here.

271
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,875
[PC 16B] It's nothing
compared to the Forest of Pain.

272
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,750
[PC 16C] The rumors say there
are ridiculously strong monsters

273
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,625
that keep appearing without
giving you any time to rest.

274
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,083
[PC 16A]
Sounds horrible.

275
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,625
[PC 16C]
Not really.

276
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,166
Apparently if you clear it,
you become exponentially strong.

277
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,833
But that's a rumor, too.

278
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,125
[PC 16B] Where do you get
that kind of information?

279
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,250
Is that right?!

280
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,625
[SABURO]
Can I sit beside you?

281
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:38,666
Huh?

282
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,083
[TABBY]
Who are you?

283
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,666
Well, my PC data is public,

284
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,625
so why don't you
have a look at it?

285
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,375
This is nice, huh?

286
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,875
Must be good
for people watching.

287
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,083
Uh, I was wondering...

288
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,041
You are a girl, aren't you?

289
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,166
[SABURO]
Yeah. Why?

290
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,958
Saburo's just a weird
name for a girl, that's all.

291
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,500
Oh my gosh, that's such
a huge stereotype!

292
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,458
What's a stereotype?

293
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,208
[SABURO]
There are boys with names

294
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,666
like "Leslie"
or "Tracy", you know?

295
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,166
[TABBY] Do you think there's
any with the name Louise?

296
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,333
[SABURO] Louise is my
great-grandfather's name.

297
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,166
I'm kidding.

298
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,041
[TABBY laughs]

299
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,708
Haseo should be--

300
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,250
I'm just here
waiting for my friend.

301
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,625
He's supposed to
pass by here soon.

302
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:32,666
Oh.

303
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,333
He's amazing.

304
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,083
He always lives up to
everyone's expectations.

305
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,041
What about you?

306
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,458
What about me?

307
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,416
I'm just useless.

308
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,666
If you say
you can't do it,

309
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,541
you really won't
be able to, you know.

310
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,500
But if you think
everything's gonna be okay,

311
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,750
it will be okay.

312
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,291
It's a lot like
a stew that will last

313
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,083
for days and days
if you keep it simmering.

314
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,125
Oh!

315
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,583
What does that mean?

316
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,791
Looks like...

317
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,166
...I am alone.

318
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,958
[PI]
Excuse me?

319
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,250
Who are you?

320
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,333
Can I speak to
you for a moment?
