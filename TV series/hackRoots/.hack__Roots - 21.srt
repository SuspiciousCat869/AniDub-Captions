1
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,625
Hey, are you okay?

2
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:12,875
What happened?

3
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,250
[MIDORI]
Tri-Edge!

4
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,166
Tri-Edge?

5
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,583
Hey did you hear
there's a Player Character

6
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,541
that got away from Tri-Edge?

7
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,541
Of course!

8
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,583
It wouldn't be
such a big deal

9
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,166
if everyone who
encountered Tri-Edge

10
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,458
simply became a Lost One.

11
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:34,791
Yeah, that's true.

12
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:35,958
So, who was it?

13
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,500
It wasn't the
Black Adept Rogue, was it?

14
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,291
No, it was
a Blue Edge Punisher.

15
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,833
Really?

16
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,916
[IITA] I think the one that
got away is that stuffed animal,

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,458
the one who always sits
at the edge of the canal.

18
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,875
[PILOCCIO] Yeah it could be,
but he's a Harvest Cleric

19
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,541
and he's more brown than blue.

20
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,416
Yeah, I guess you're right.

21
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,791
I'm going to the port
to gather some information.

22
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,416
It's definitely
this Player Character.

23
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,541
[YATA/NAOBI]
So she escaped Tri-Edge.

24
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,291
She looks like
a rare character.

25
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,625
[PI/ENDER] That one
is legitimate, though.

26
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,375
Tri-Edge.

27
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:18,500
The Lost Ones.

28
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,416
A series of
mysterious phenomena.

29
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,000
Is this PC
just another player

30
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,250
that got swept up
with the tides,

31
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:29,291
or is there something
more at play here...?

32
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,916
What would you
like me to do?

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,083
Well, Pi.

34
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,625
Yes.

35
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,708
Think like Ovan would think,
then act like Ovan would act.

36
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,458
I see.

37
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,750
[TABBY]
Where's Phyllo?

38
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,625
[TOUTA/TAWARAYA]
Hi there!

39
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,958
I haven't seen
him yet today.

40
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,291
Oh.

41
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,791
He's usually here,

42
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,958
so it seems kinda weird
when he's not around.

43
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,583
Is something going on?

44
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,791
You don't have
time to talk do you?

45
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,000
Sure.

46
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,375
I was wondering...

47
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:23,958
If I were Shino, what
would I be doing right now?

48
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,166
I've been thinking
this whole time

49
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,875
about what it
is that I can do.

50
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:32,541
But no matter
how hard I try

51
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,166
I can't be like Shino.

52
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,583
So, I should just do
my best with what I can do.

53
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,291
And what would that be?

54
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,291
I'm actually not too
sure about what to do.

55
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,208
That's why I came
to get Phyllo's advice.

56
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,041
I think that you
should be a guild master.

57
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,458
Huh?

58
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,333
There are things
you can do with a team

59
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,916
that you simply
can't do alone.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,083
Why don't you just
make a guild for now?

61
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,291
Then see where
things go from there.

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,166
It's really too bad...

63
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,708
but like I said,
you guys are no match for me.

64
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,208
Come on.

65
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,083
How can you really know that
for sure until you try us?

66
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:29,458
Well, maybe the
rumors are false.

67
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,250
[HASEO] The word on the street
is that you know Tri-Edge.

68
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,541
Master Yata.

69
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,166
This is beyond anything
we could have expected.

70
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,625
Is that all you've got?

71
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,333
[SABURO] Man! That punk!

72
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,375
I can't get that
guy out of my head.

73
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:39,750
Don't think you can scare
me with your brute strength.

74
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:43,875
I am who I am because
I'm able to wield this power.

75
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:44,791
What do you want?

76
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,666
Your "hit-me-if-you-can"
service.

77
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,416
I get one minute, right?

78
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,083
Is that what you came for?

79
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,500
How much?

80
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:56,333
If you become a repeat customer,
the first time is free.

81
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,125
So that's why
I started up a guild,

82
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,750
but I still don't
know what to do.

83
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,291
[SEISAKU] Personally, I think
you should take things in order.

84
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,583
Huh?

85
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:10,958
First, what do
you want to do?

86
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,083
I really wanna help Haseo.

87
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,416
What do you
mean help?

88
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,208
I think that maybe
I'm capable of healing people.

89
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,583
Not just Haseo, but I'm
certain I can revive others

90
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,666
including those people
who've been killed by Haseo.

91
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,375
Healing is not a job
for a Tribal Grappler.

92
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:30,166
But I could... if I carried
the maximum number of items.

93
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,333
There's no way
you can get

94
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,750
enough money to do
something like that.

95
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,375
I guess.

96
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,083
But you did ask me
what I want to do.

97
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,583
True.

98
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,500
Alright,
let's move on.

99
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,166
Next you have
to figure out

100
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,291
what you need to do
in order to achieve that.

101
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't know.

102
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
I'll give you
a hand.

103
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,458
Huh?

104
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,583
Listen I'll do whatever
you need me to do.

105
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,625
So why don't we do
our best together?

106
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,333
That's all you get.

107
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:27,250
Your free minute is up.

108
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,958
So I guess that's it.

109
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,666
Master Yata,
look at this.

110
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,708
I've just finished
investigating

111
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,416
the details
of her player log.

112
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,333
It's here at
Briona Gwydion.

113
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,708
Give me the gist of it.

114
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,458
Please wait,
there's one more.

115
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:51,375
This is the log of
Tri-Edge and Ovan's battle.

116
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,541
Same time, same place.

117
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,208
In other words,
she witnessed

118
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,583
the battle between
Tri-Edge and Ovan.

119
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:01,083
She was there
the entire time.

120
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,250
Very interesting.

121
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,791
But that event is
already in the past.

122
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,083
Tell me.

123
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,083
What are you going to do
with this information?

124
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,750
As you said,
I will think like Ovan

125
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,916
and I will act like Ovan.

126
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,875
Welcome back Pilo.

127
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,041
"Hit-me-if-you-can."

128
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,541
Huh?

129
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,750
The survivor Midori has a
"hit-me-if-you-can" business.

130
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,833
I don't get it.

131
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:23,750
Basically,
for the right price

132
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,583
anybody can try
and attack her.

133
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,041
No, I still
don't understand.

134
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,875
She puts a bounty on herself

135
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,125
and gets other players
to pay to challenge her.

136
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,500
If they can hit her once,
they get a reward.

137
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,416
If not, she keeps the cash.

138
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
It really must be
the end of this world

139
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,500
for a business like
that to be profitable.

140
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,083
Is it really
successful?

141
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,291
It seems to be.

142
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,916
Welcome to our shop!

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Where's Touta?

144
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,000
Do you know him?

145
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,333
Well, yes.

146
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,916
The reason I'm here is
to offer some information.

147
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Sorry, but we don't buy
or sell information here.

148
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,750
I'm not trying
to sell information.

149
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,041
I said "offer," didn't I?

150
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,708
Well that
probably won't work.

151
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,916
There's nothing more
expensive than what's free.

152
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,333
It's not like
I'm not offering

153
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,250
the information
to you anyway.

154
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,333
Touta should be the one

155
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,000
to make that decision,
don't you think?

156
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,208
Yeah, I guess...

157
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,166
Alright then... so...
you wanna hear it?

158
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,458
Hi!

159
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,750
Hold on a minute--

160
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,666
You can have
this PC body back.

161
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,875
What do I need to do?

162
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,166
If I log out, will that
do the trick for ya?

163
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,125
Huh?

164
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,916
You did say you
wanted to use it.

165
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,250
So I'm giving it back now.

166
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,250
What are you up to?

167
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,333
Nothing at all.

168
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,875
Don't you think
it's much better to have

169
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,416
a cheap crappy car that
I can use whenever I want,

170
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,083
than a fancy expensive car

171
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,666
that could be taken
away at any moment?

172
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,666
I actually
understand you for once.

173
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,416
So what are you
planning to do

174
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,916
with your cheap crappy car

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,500
that you can use
whenever you want?

176
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,041
I'll give you a hint!

177
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,958
Haseo.

178
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,250
I think I'd just like to
watch him a little bit more.

179
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,541
I don't need it.

180
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,708
What?

181
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,041
That Player Character
is useless anyway,

182
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,625
you can have it.

183
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,875
But why?

184
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,333
Like I said,
it's become useless to me.

185
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,750
Didn't I just tell you
I don't need it anymore?

186
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,000
No matter how long
you keep sour milk,

187
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,500
it's not like you're ever
gonna drink it again, are you?

188
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,583
Even if it ferments
and turns into cheese,

189
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,750
that's not
the original intent--

190
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,083
I take back
what I said

191
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,333
'cause I'm sick of
your stupid metaphors!

192
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,833
Really?

193
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:58,916
That's right.

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm giving you
that PC body.

195
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:04,250
Don't come
near me again!

196
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,291
So those are the conditions
for me to be free?

197
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:15,000
Sometimes it's like dealing
with a grouchy five-year-old.

198
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,500
What a brat.

199
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:23,541
Hi guys!

200
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,625
How's business coming along?

201
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:26,791
Oh, hey Touta!

202
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,041
Pilo and I got some
amazing information!

203
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,625
Yeah it's about
the player who witnessed

204
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,583
the battle between
Tri-Edge and another PC.

205
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,000
You guys know who it is?

206
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,375
And we also learned that
the player in question

207
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,833
actually fought
with Tri-Edge too!

208
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,166
So I guess that would
make them a witness as

209
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,750
well as a survivor then.

210
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,958
Got a name yet?

211
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,041
Midori.

212
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,250
Midori.

213
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,916
She isn't logged in
right now by any chance?

214
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,375
She has a very
strange business.

215
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,958
A so-called
"hit-me-if-you-can" business.

216
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,791
Who's the source
of this information?

217
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:57,875
Some girl.

218
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,666
Her name's Pi,
and she has pink hair.

219
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,916
You know her?

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,250
She seemed to know you.

221
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,500
If you know her you should
show her your appreciation.

222
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,291
Plus she seemed
to know that we were

223
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,083
looking for that
information already.

224
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,291
I'll be back in a bit.

225
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,416
Why? Why not me?

226
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,250
How can Midori
come across Tri-Edge

227
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,583
when I've been
hunting for him?

228
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,916
 You're the one with the
"hit-me-if-you-can" business.

229
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,083
And you are...?

230
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:57,083
Well you can call me
the tip-off man, Touta.

231
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,833
So, you're here
doing business too.

232
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,541
There's something
I wanna ask you.

233
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,250
What?

234
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,875
You have to tell me
if you know Tri-Edge.

235
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,416
It's that again, huh.

236
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,875
What do you mean "again"?

237
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,125
You're actually
not the only one

238
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,000
who's wanted to
know about that.

239
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,000
You're pretty
popular, aren't you?

240
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,583
Word on the street has it
that you're not only a survivor,

241
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,625
but in fact
you're also a witness.

242
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,125
Isn't that right?

243
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,208
What are you suggesting?

244
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,208
What I'm saying is
that you faced Tri-Edge

245
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,291
and barely got
away with your life.

246
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:30,291
That's true, but I'm not
sure what you mean by "witness."

247
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,666
You encountered
Tri-Edge once before

248
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,625
and saw
something interesting.

249
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:39,291
A battle between Tri-Edge
and another player.

250
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,875
[gunshots]

251
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,250
The information
you have is correct.

252
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,791
I've encountered Tri-Edge
on more than one occasion.

253
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,041
Or perhaps I should say
I saw him one of those times.

254
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,375
So is that all
you wanted to ask me?

255
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,791
I wanna know more
about the player

256
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,708
that was
fighting Tri-Edge.

257
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,583
I don't think
I could tell you.

258
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,541
I was watching
from far away.

259
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,833
Then what
can you tell me?

260
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,791
I don't remember.

261
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,958
He seemed to know...

262
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,541
It was a guy then?

263
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:59,583
He knew his way around the
Lost Ground "Briona Gwydion."

264
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,291
I understand.

265
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,083
You won't get any more
information out of me,

266
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,875
no matter how hard you try.

267
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,875
That's all right.

268
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,791
What is this?

269
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,208
Just a little something
for the information.

270
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,625
Are you stupid?

271
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,333
After someone answers your
questions out of kindness.

272
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,958
You must know
the purpose of this

273
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,458
was only to show my
gratitude for your kindness.

274
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,625
I don't want it.

275
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,458
Then I guess that means
I still owe you one.

276
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,916
See you later.

277
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,208
Will Haseo fight
with Midori again?

278
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,791
Yes.

279
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,500
This time it won't be one of her
"hit-me-if-you-can" services.

280
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,916
She'll be fighting
with all of her strength.

281
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,250
Will it shake him up?

282
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,083
It won't hurt to try.

283
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,500
That's how Ovan
would think, isn't it?

284
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,291
Hey! Are you ready?

285
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,416
Yup!

286
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,583
That character...

287
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,166
I'm afraid you'll
have to get rid of it.

288
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,208
How come?

289
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,208
The impact of
first impressions.

290
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,958
A guild should
be well-rounded.

291
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,958
Are you saying I
should remake myself?

292
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,833
That's right.
Your vocation again?

293
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,375
Blade Brandier.

294
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,125
Then you should change your
vocation to a Harvest Cleric.

295
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,208
What?

296
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,333
How about me?

297
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,750
You've already
opened a guild

298
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,375
so you can't
change your character.

299
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,708
Oh yeah.

300
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,250
Hold on, so it's just the two
of you doing this together?

301
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,833
Uh, yeah.

302
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,916
What is the minimum
number for a party?

303
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,458
Um, three?

304
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,958
You're missing
one person.

305
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,916
One more, huh?

306
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,166
How about Phyllo?

307
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,750
Are you serious?

308
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,375
I guess not.

309
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,583
Of course.

310
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,083
If Phyllo was gonna
do anything like

311
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,791
that I'd have
him help me first.

312
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,916
Just one more person.

313
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,333
One of my
"real world" friends

314
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,208
said he's gonna
start playing soon.

315
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,500
I'll see if Hideyo
wants to join us.

316
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,666
Hideyo?

317
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,500
That's a very plain
name isn't it?

318
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,625
And then...

319
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,708
Uh-Huh?

320
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,000
I'll ditch this character.

321
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,458
Nya?

322
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,958
It's okay.

323
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,000
Alright, now that the members
have been decided,

324
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,541
you need to start thinking
about your catchphrase.

325
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,458
Catchphrase?

326
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,833
If you wanna be
remembered in the future,

327
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,708
you're gonna have to come up
with a mission statement.

328
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:07,916
I see.

329
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,916
So what are you
gonna call your guild?

330
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,041
Paw Pad Squadron!

331
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,250
Paw Pad?

332
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,041
What, you mean like...

333
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,083
the little soft parts
of a dog or cat's paw?

334
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,083
Yeah.

335
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,541
Is it bad?

336
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,375
[giggles] Perfect!

337
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,500
Sorry I'm late.

338
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,083
So what is it?

339
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,750
There's a Player Character

340
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,916
who defeated
Tri-Edge at Briona Gwydion.

341
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,583
What did you say?

342
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:52,083
Are you telling me that
Tri-Edge isn't around anymore?

343
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,958
I really don't
know about that.

344
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,208
Who was it?

345
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,916
Who and where is
the guy that defeated him?

346
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,041
I don't know.

347
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,625
My informant
doesn't seem to remember,

348
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,916
and there's no way I can
dig for the information.

349
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,416
Tell me who told you this.

350
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,833
Midori.

351
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,041
The player who has the
"hit-me-if-you-can" business.

352
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,250
I know her!

353
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,500
She's a survivor and
a witness or so I heard.

354
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,291
No, it would be
the other way around.

355
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,708
She was able to survive

356
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,166
because she has
witnessed him before.

357
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,958
That seems to
be more logical.

358
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,041
Where are you going?

359
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,666
Where do you think?

360
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,541
Well I guess that
was to be expected.

361
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,125
What do you
want this time?

362
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,375
You!

363
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,166
What do you
know about Tri-Edge?

364
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,625
I already told you!

365
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,250
I've heard that you were there
when Tri-Edge was defeated.

366
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,458
And if I was?

367
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,375
You'd better think harder

368
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,375
and tell me about
the one who beat him.

369
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:27,041
Get lost, I don't
want to remember.

370
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,625
I can smell
death in the air.

371
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,375
I wish you were good enough

372
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:55,958
to take Tri-Edge's place
and fight just like him.

373
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,166
You're not bad.

374
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,166
You're actually
pretty good.

375
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:04,083
Tell me... who
exactly are you?

376
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:08,458
I told you, I run a
"hit-me-if-you-can" business.

377
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,500
He was pretty strong
you know, that Tri-Edge.

378
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,083
Guess you're just
not strong enough.

379
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,791
Whatever.

380
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,833
Apparently the Factor
is still dormant.

381
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,750
What is this?

382
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:22,291
I can't even defeat the one who
barely got away from Tri-Edge?
