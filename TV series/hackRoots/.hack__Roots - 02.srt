1
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,333
[TABBY] I never knew a place
like this could ever exist!

2
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:22,958
It is beautiful,
isn't it?

3
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:26,000
It's known as
The Lost Ground.

4
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,583
You mean... "a place
that couldn't be found"?

5
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,083
Yes.

6
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,291
[OVAN] I hope you
weren't waiting long.

7
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,416
I was.
Just a little.

8
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,541
Pleased to meet you!!

9
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, you must be Tabby.

10
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,333
I'll do my very best!

11
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,541
So what should we do now?

12
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,583
Well, why don't we go @HOME?

13
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,125
You've never seen
it before have you?

14
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,875
By "home" do you mean like
headquarters for the guild?

15
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,250
That's right.

16
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,333
Well, let's go @HOME then.

17
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,625
What about you?

18
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,083
I think I'm going
to go see him.

19
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,625
Do you mean boyfriend?

20
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,500
He's another
candidate for the guild.

21
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,583
[TABBY] Awww!

22
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
[SHINO] You came.
I figured you would.

23
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,000
Would you like
to go for a walk?

24
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,291
[HASEO] Why?

25
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,500
Do you need a reason?

26
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,916
I guess not.

27
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,750
Well then, let's go.

28
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,166
Aren't you coming?

29
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,125
You don't need to worry,

30
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,208
Player Killers won't
target anyone in town.

31
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,083
No I know, it isn't that...

32
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,416
[SHINO] Why did you
start playing again?

33
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,583
[HASEO] Why?

34
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,916
After what you said,

35
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,625
I didn't think
you'd come back.

36
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,458
That doesn't matter.

37
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,916
But, Haseo, it does.

38
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,791
I really don't
get all of this.

39
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:42,125
[SHINO] You
have a gift.

40
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,750
Wait, what did you say?

41
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,625
A gift...

42
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,916
Ovan said so, too.

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,875
Listen lady, what is
the deal with you and Ovan?

44
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,708
There's more to it than just
being in the same guild, right?

45
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,166
Hey, it's not "lady."

46
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,166
Uh...

47
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,875
It's Shino.

48
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,125
Shino.

49
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,583
Um, Haseo?

50
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,541
You haven't joined
a guild yet, right?

51
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:11,208
How would you like
to come join Ovan and I?

52
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,416
Hello?

53
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,875
But first...

54
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:15,875
What?

55
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,541
Would you please
answer my question.

56
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,708
You mean about Ovan and I?

57
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:21,875
Yeah.

58
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,208
When Ovan isn't around

59
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,583
I take his place
as the guild master.

60
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:29,916
I suppose I might start
sounding like him sometimes.

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,291
What kind of
guild is it?

62
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,000
The Twilight Brigade...

63
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,125
Have you heard of it?

64
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,750
I heard you're
looking for something.

65
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,333
Yes that's right,
the Key of the Twilight...

66
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,458
But that isn't
the only thing.

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,708
So, what's your
answer to the offer?

68
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,166
Do you think you'd
like to join the guild?

69
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,916
I'm sure you'll
enjoy playing with us.

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,583
Where is Ovan?

71
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:57,666
Right now?

72
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,583
He's with a new
member who just joined.

73
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,041
New member?

74
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:04,166
Yes, in fact
I invited her to join.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,916
I'm gonna pass.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,916
Huh?

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,750
On the guild.

78
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,541
I see.

79
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,666
Oh well.

80
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,416
I'm sorry to hear that.

81
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,500
I...

82
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,000
We do need you Haseo.

83
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,875
But, I'm not going
to force you to join.

84
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:20,875
Here.

85
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,791
I'll give you
my member address.

86
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,333
This is a registered one.

87
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,333
Don't hesitate to
contact me if you need to.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,625
Oh... and...

89
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,125
When you're
talking with someone

90
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,333
you should at least try
to look them in the eye.

91
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,250
[HASEO]
In the eye?

92
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,708
Why should I bother looking
a CG character in the eye?

93
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,666
This is just a game.

94
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,083
[SHINO] So what
if it's a game?

95
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,375
You should do it specifically
because it's a game.

96
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,666
You don't want
to talk to someone

97
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,875
who's looking
the other way, do you?

98
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,750
I really don't get it.

99
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,250
You know,
like babies...

100
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,833
They can't talk,

101
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:02,250
so they watch their
mother's face very closely.

102
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,666
I'm sure you
can do something

103
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,666
that even a baby
can do, can't you?

104
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,916
I...

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,958
Well, see
you later!

106
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,416
[ODAN] Huh. Haven't
seen you in a while!

107
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,083
[SAKISAKA] Well I've
been here the whole time.

108
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,666
[TABBY gasps]
Oh, wow!

109
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,125
It's like some kind
of top-secret base!

110
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,833
A new member?

111
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:31,750
Yes. That's Tabby.

112
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,291
Tabby?

113
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,708
This is Sakisaka.

114
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,416
The two of you will
be working together

115
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,708
for the next little while.

116
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,125
Meow.

117
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,166
It's so very nice to
meet you, Mr. Sakisaka!

118
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,083
Yeah, yeah, it's nice
to meet you too.

119
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,583
So, are you
taking off again?

120
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,208
Yes, to gather
information.

121
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,083
Well, I guess it doesn't
matter if you're not around.

122
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,791
Since we're
getting more members,

123
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,750
we can probably
make do somehow.

124
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,083
It can't be helped.

125
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,750
It's Tabby, right?

126
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,166
Yes?

127
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,875
What level--wait, don't
tell me you just started?

128
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,541
I'm a fresh new beginner!

129
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,166
Thanks for taking me
under your wing!

130
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,625
What am I gonna do?

131
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,250
[PHYLLO] What do
you want to know?

132
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,041
Tell me about the Brigade.

133
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,958
You declined,
didn't you?

134
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,583
I did...
but I just...

135
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,708
Well, okay.

136
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,250
I don't know much though.

137
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,833
So... tell me then.

138
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,375
It's all about
The Key of the Twilight.

139
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,041
A legendary item
shrouded in mystery

140
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:44,000
that some people believe
once existed in The World.

141
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,708
The Twilight Brigade
is searching for it.

142
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,666
Legendary?

143
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,750
You can find all the details
posted on the forum.

144
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,166
I'm gonna go look.

145
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,166
Don't bother.

146
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,666
It's a waste of time.

147
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,625
In the end, the whole thing
is nothing but pure speculation.

148
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,708
It just says
that it exists,

149
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:09,250
but nobody knows where
it is or what it's for.

150
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,125
It might have an affect
on whether or not

151
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,666
your whole status is
raised to the highest level.

152
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,583
It might get you
more pocket money.

153
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,125
It might be a weapon that's
one of a kind in this game,

154
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:22,875
or it might be used to fulfill
any wish that you may have...

155
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,416
Okay, enough.

156
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,708
There are some
people who say

157
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,541
it can override
the rules of this game

158
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:28,708
from the very foundation.

159
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,541
If the rules
can be overthrown,

160
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,208
the game will
be completely undermined

161
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,958
and The World will crumble.

162
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,625
That would be catastrophic.

163
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,250
There's no such thing.

164
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,416
Maybe, but the Twilight
Brigade thinks there is

165
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,958
and they're committed
to finding it.

166
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,958
If it's a guild,
well then I'm guessing

167
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,083
they must have quite
a few members, right?

168
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,750
No, it's a small guild.

169
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,250
There are only
a handful of them.

170
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,833
Yeah, but still, do they
all believe in this thing?

171
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,458
Maybe they do?

172
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,083
Or maybe they just find pleasure
in their treasure hunting.

173
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:06,166
And you know, your friend
Ovan is the guild master.

174
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,375
Should I arrange
a meeting?

175
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,375
You mean with Ovan?

176
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,875
No, I'm referring
to a former member.

177
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,250
Former...

178
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,125
They happen to be
online right now.

179
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,791
Whether or not they'll
tell you anything

180
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,583
is another
matter all together.

181
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,750
If that's okay with you,

182
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,458
I'll arrange
an introduction.

183
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,625
We've exceeded 40 hits!

184
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,458
Um, um...
What do I do now?

185
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,125
[TABBY screams]

186
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,416
Ok now you're ready
for the Rengeki finish!

187
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,333
You've got your finger
on the skill trigger.

188
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,583
You're good to go!

189
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,375
Oh okay!

190
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,125
Sakisaka,
I'm goin' for it!

191
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,750
Awesome!

192
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,750
That attack was
really powerful!

193
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,708
Yeah that's right!

194
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:09,833
And if you keep
working at it,

195
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,708
you'll be climbing
levels faster than ever.

196
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,916
But, I can't do
this by myself, can I?

197
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Well, I guess not.

198
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,583
Then thanks for
being my partner!

199
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,625
What?!

200
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:22,666
Who me?!

201
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,083
Well, you know
how to use spells.

202
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,333
Ovan's too strong.

203
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,791
He'll destroy our opponents

204
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,958
before I have a chance
to use my Rengeki.

205
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:30,791
See?

206
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,666
You're the only
one for me.

207
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,375
I guess I have no choice.

208
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,625
[BSET] You're late.

209
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,750
Phyllo told me
about you.

210
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,625
Come on, follow me.

211
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,541
Uh, hey! Wait up!

212
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,291
How far are we going?

213
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,125
[BSET] Just be quiet
and follow me.

214
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,041
I don't want anyone
overhearing us...

215
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:17,583
And finding out that I used
to belong to that guild.

216
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,333
Here's fine.

217
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:30,083
So, I hear you want
to know why I left.

218
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,333
I suppose you're involved
with the Twilight Brigade

219
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,041
if it has the
old man talking.

220
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,625
No, not yet.

221
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,208
Well, whatever.
They're trouble.

222
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,583
You're better off
doing your own thing

223
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,416
and staying clear
of that guild.

224
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,208
You say "that guild"?

225
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,291
But didn't they
do lots for you?

226
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,708
Do lots for me?

227
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,791
I believe I did
lots for them.

228
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,250
Thanks to Ovan and his Key
of the Twilight or whatever,

229
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,208
I was sent to all kinds
of strange, stupid places.

230
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:04,083
I had to be on standby
for hours on end.

231
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,625
If you weren't being forced why
didn't you just stop playing?

232
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,000
I mean, even though you
were there voluntarily,

233
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,750
you stuck around, so you
must have believed in it.

234
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,916
Why was the Key of the Twilight
so important to the guild?

235
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Why were you
looking for it?

236
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:26,000
To be honest, it wasn't
the item I was interested in.

237
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,250
So what about you?

238
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,250
Why are you
interested in the guild?

239
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:34,000
Because of Ovan...
I guess.

240
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,708
Oh that's curious.

241
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,083
It was the same
reason for me.

242
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,166
But, you know,
even if you do join them

243
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,750
you will never
understand Ovan at all.

244
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,000
Maybe...

245
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,583
I know he's mysterious.

246
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,000
They'll only use you.

247
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,708
For what?

248
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,958
Well... actually, there's
some one else who quit,

249
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,208
who can tell you more.

250
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,583
Would you like to meet him?

251
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,041
Yeah sure.

252
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,750
Just gimme a second.

253
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,166
He's a bit troublesome,

254
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,250
but he says he's
willing to meet you.

255
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,041
Troublesome?

256
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,916
[TAWARAYA snoring]

257
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,375
[ENDER]
You're disgusting.

258
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,125
[TAKWARAYA]
I'm tired.

259
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,791
It's your job
to stoc the place.

260
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,333
Quit complaining.

261
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,541
Look, my job in
the real world is enough.

262
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,583
Hey Ender,
where'd you get that?

263
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,208
What? This old thing?

264
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,500
I just found it somewhere.

265
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,416
The god of good fortune
is smiling on me!

266
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,458
[TAWARAYA chuckles]

267
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,583
Huh? What?

268
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,000
This, my dear, is what
I've been looking for!

269
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,666
You could at least
let me try it out first.

270
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,583
Why not!

271
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,875
I'm not in a hurry.

272
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,375
You can use it for a while.

273
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,666
Just don't lose
it or break it.

274
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,583
Oh how very
generous of you.

275
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,875
Hey it's
not like that.

276
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,416
I told my client that
it would take a while...

277
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,208
You know what
I really want?

278
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,333
I want a weapon that's
one of a kind in The World.

279
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,666
Something that
would belong only to me.

280
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,708
What do ya say?

281
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,833
Can you find it
for me, Tawaraya?

282
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,125
Well this does sound
very interesting.

283
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,041
But what the heck
are you talking about?

284
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:18,958
I'm talking about
The Key of the Twilight...

285
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,958
No matter who
my opponent might be,

286
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,916
I could dispose of them
with a single stroke.

287
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,375
And you think
this thing exists?

288
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,791
No, I don't.
I'm kidding.

289
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,083
But, if somebody like
Naobi is looking for it,

290
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,416
can you really say
that it doesn't exist?

291
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,625
Yeah, but Naobi
is always interested

292
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,625
in whatever Ovan
is interested in.

293
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:42,041
Well wherever there's smoke,
there's always fire.

294
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,708
Actually, you know,
a really good businessman

295
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,791
knows how to make
smoke without fire.

296
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,625
Oh that's right!
I gotta get back to work!

297
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,000
And don't lose that!

298
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,125
Yeah, yeah.

299
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,375
[OVAN]
So, it didn't work.

300
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,458
[SHINO] You know, I think
it would be better

301
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,166
if you went instead of me.

302
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,083
He seems to be really
interested in you.

303
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,833
Is that right.

304
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,541
I don't know...

305
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,916
I think I probably
said too much.

306
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,750
I didn't say
Tabby's name,

307
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,000
but I told him that
she'd already joined

308
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,750
and that she
was off with you.

309
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,333
I see.

310
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,166
[SHINO] He's
pretty stubborn.

311
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,625
I'm not sure I'll get
through to him...

312
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,333
I think it would
be best if you went.

313
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,083
[ODAN] Okay.
I'll do that.

314
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,416
Do you really
agree with me?

315
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,583
I just sensed
the same thing.

316
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,625
Still...

317
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:42,333
I have a feeling that
Haseo will join the guild.

318
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,458
Yes, he definitely will.

319
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,750
Uh huh, and how
do you know?

320
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,458
Women's intuition.

321
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,750
[GORD yelling]

322
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,000
[GORD]
You passed the test.

323
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,541
You're weak, but you
have the will to win.

324
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,041
Who the heck
do you think you are?

325
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,375
Well you're Haseo,
aren't you?

326
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,750
Yeah.

327
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,041
What?

328
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,625
Didn't Bset
tell you anything?

329
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,500
She said I'd know
when I got here.

330
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,916
So.

331
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,625
Obviously she neglected
to tell you anything about me.

332
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:54,916
Huh?

333
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,833
Saving the weak!

334
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:56,791
Defeating the strong!

335
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,625
I am the righteous
hand of...!!

336
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,250
You're a PK?

337
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,333
Well, yeah.

338
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,833
I guess you could say that.

339
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,458
So, what are
you gonna do?

340
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,916
What, exactly,
do you mean?

341
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,416
Aren't you gonna
defeat Ovan?

342
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,708
What?

343
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,083
Oh, I see.

344
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,625
Just wanna
know about Ovan.

345
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:13,708
Mm hmm.

346
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,416
Well for now.

347
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,291
Sit down.

348
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,708
Listen to me.

349
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,208
Ovan is trouble.

350
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,125
The fact that he believes
that "thing" exists

351
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:28,000
not only makes him weird,
but downright crazy.

352
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,083
By "thing," you mean
the Key of the Twilight.

353
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,750
Listen, a legend's
place in the world

354
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,166
is to be just that... a legend.

355
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,333
What if demons and
ghosts and goblins

356
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,375
started popping up
everywhere for real?

357
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,000
It just doesn't happen.

358
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,750
Did you meet Ovan?

359
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,083
Yeah.

360
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,416
What did you think
of his left arm?

361
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,000
His left arm?

362
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,125
No matter how you look
at it that's cheating.

363
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,000
Normally you can't
customize like that.

364
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,541
Cheating?

365
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,958
Doing stuff that's illegal.

366
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:00,333
You're not supposed
to tamper with data.

367
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,916
You'd better stay
away from him.

368
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,208
I have no idea
why you took

369
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,083
an interest in him,
in the first place.

370
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,583
So, I'm charging
you an information fee.

371
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,041
Huh?

372
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,458
Nothing is free.

373
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,250
Come on, pay up!

374
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,791
But I don't... I...
I don't have that much!

375
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,958
Well then you won't mind if
I take it out of your hide.

376
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,750
Dude! I'm kidding!

377
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,041
You know?

378
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,625
This game may be
too much for you.

379
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,458
I'm goin' back.

380
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,708
Oh! Ovan!

381
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,333
Are you trying to advance
your levels by yourself?

382
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,666
Uh... yeah.

383
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,916
Wh-What are
you doing?

384
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,250
I'm meeting someone.

385
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,291
[TABBY panting]
Thanks for waiting!

386
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,916
Do you know him?

387
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,208
Mmhmm.

388
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,083
Haseo, allow me
to introduce you.

389
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,083
This is--

390
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,416
I'm Tabby!

391
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,291
I became a member of
the Twilight Brigade today!

392
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,041
Nice to meet you Haseo!

393
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,916
Can I go shopping now?

394
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,708
Sure.

395
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,083
Okay, see ya later!

396
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:24,583
Tabby seems to have
an abundance of energy...

397
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:28,333
Haseo why don't you
consider joining me?

398
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,958
Because I don't understand.

399
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,166
Words are inadequate...

400
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,583
For example,
Key of the Twilight.

401
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,500
The more we
talk about it,

402
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,166
the more
surreal it sounds.

403
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,416
Does it exist?

404
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,083
You can decide
it's not real.

405
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,750
Or you can think it might
exist and search for it.

406
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,791
As a game, which
is more interesting?

407
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:57,708
Haseo, will you come
look for it with me?

408
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,416
I'll give it
some thought.

409
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,416
That's fine.

410
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,083
Well, I gotta go.

411
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,708
It's been awhile.

412
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:31,208
It seems to me like you
never come into town anymore.

413
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,916
[NAOBI]
No, I don't.

414
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,916
So, did you come all
the way here to see me?

415
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,416
And what if I did?

416
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,375
It's about Haseo, right?

417
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,958
You never seem to change.

418
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,375
Well then, this place
won't do, will it?

419
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,708
Let's go somewhere else.

420
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,875
Hmm, I suppose
we should.

421
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,166
I think...

422
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,541
Haseo will definitely
join the guild.
