00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,541
It's frustrating, isn't it?

2
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:20,916
What's frustrating?

3
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,416
I'm pretty sure Haseo
is out there doing his best.

4
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,625
Yeah... I'm certain he is.

5
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,750
And still, there's
absolutely nothing

6
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,250
I can do to help him.

7
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,166
I don't even know if he's
really okay right now.

8
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,041
You can at least go
and ask him how he's doing.

9
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,250
Don't you know?

10
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,416
[PHYLLO]
What?

11
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,458
You can't send
messages, even short ones,

12
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,083
to the Forest of Pain.

13
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,416
[PHYLLO]
Is that so?

14
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,708
Yeah.

15
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,416
You can transmit
once you're in there,

16
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,166
but not from the outside.

17
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,583
[PHYLLO]
Really?

18
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,541
[TABBY]
It's strange, isn't it?

19
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,166
I think that's why
everyone's saying

20
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,916
this event isn't normal.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,250
[PHYLLO] Yes, but once
you're inside the forest,

22
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,166
you can contact him, right?

23
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:10,958
[TABBY] Well, if I go in there,
I'll just get in the way.

24
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,500
[PHYLLO]
You think?

25
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,666
You know what?

26
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,166
I wanna go in and
ask him how he's doing.

27
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,541
And also, I wanna be
helping out somehow.

28
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,708
But no...

29
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,625
Haseo--He wouldn't like that.

30
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,958
I understand.

31
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,291
That is frustrating.

32
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:31,416
Well...

33
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,875
Just three hours 'til it's over.

34
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,625
And it looks like it's
going to be a long three hours.

35
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,083
I can't be dealing with
these worthless monsters.

36
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,916
I gotta get to the deepest
area before I'm outta time.

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,166
There's no end to this!

38
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,333
Get out of my way!

39
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,541
I will get stronger.

40
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,833
I have to.

41
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,291
I will get stronger!

42
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,541
Their moves are simple,
but I'll be dead for sure

43
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,541
if I get hit. Great.

44
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,000
Anyway, I lost Taihaku.

45
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,250
I wonder what I should do?

Hey, how come you can e-mail
me from outside the forest?

[PI] I'm the one
with the questions here.

You're not beside
Haseo, are you?

51
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,166
[SABURO] Is that why
you came into the forest?

I can't seem to move.

56
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,583
I've actually started
thinking about quitting.

What?!

58

This isn't some joke!

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,250
[SABURO] Don't you
think it's as useless

00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,583
as putting an unopened can
of food in the fridge?

61

[PI]
I don't get it.

62
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,583
Anyway, keep some distance
and continue watching Haseo.

63
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,750
Okay.

64
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,208

Are you here?

00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,416
Yeah. Sorry.

71
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,625
I was...

00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,625
...just studying
for tomorrow's class.

73
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,916
There's still two hours
left in the event.

I'm always here like this.

[TABBY] I've been curious
about that for awhile.

79
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,875
So do you just sit there
looking at your monitor

80
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,875
until someone comes
and talks to you?

No, silly.

I read books, magazines,
and play with my dog.

You have a dog?!

A Schnauzer. Do you
know what that is?

[TABBY]
Yeah! The bearded dog, isn't it?

86
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,041
That's right.
He turned twelve last month.

87

In human years, he's
eighty-four years old.

He's an old timer

you were that old.

I'm not acquainted
with your daughter.

00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,375
'cause I hung around
even after I said he quit.

162
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,500
But you know,
I only thought he left.

163
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,666
I just lost sight of him

164
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,041
'cause he wanted
to get away from me.

165
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,625
But it turns out
he was still there.

166
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,958
[PI] You're the one
who didn't obey orders.

167
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,041
You know what?

168
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,291
I've had enough.

169
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,166
[SABURO] There's something
suspicious about you.

170
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,666
I don't like it.
I'm logging out.

171
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,666
[PI]
Don't think I'm going to--

172
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,916
[SABURO]
Forgive me for it?

173
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,875
That's fine.
Do what you want.

174
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,666
As long as it doesn't
stir up a hornet's nest,

175
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,166
everything will be okay, right?

176
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,666
[PI] You don't understand
anything, do you?!

177
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,166
[SABURO]
Then explain it to me!

178
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,583
I have to keep my mouth shut

179
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,750
and deal with enough pointless
work in the real world.

180
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,083
And to be honest,

181
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,250
that's the last thing
I wanna put up with here!

182
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,041
Taihaku of Icolo?

183
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,375
Well, yes,

184
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,166
I sort of know who he is.

185
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,791
Then there's no mistake.

186
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,375
I heard people
talking about it in town

187
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,333
and I checked
it in the forum.

188
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,000
He's the one.

189
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,541
Who finished the challenge?

190
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,458
[TABBY]
Yeah.

191
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,875
What kind of person is he?

192
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,333
Icolo is a group of people

193
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,541
who have a strong pride
in their own strength.

194
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,583
There are only four members.

195
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,416
Out of the four,
Taihaku's at the top.

196
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,750
[TABBY] He must be
very strong, then.

197
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,500
I wonder if Haseo's okay?

198
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,500
[PHYLLO]
Tabby?

199
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,333
[TABBY]
Yeah?

200
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,041
Be patient for now.

201
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,333
[TABBY]
Huh?

202
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,375
You won't always be
rewarded for working hard.

203
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,708
Sadly, the reality
is not that simple.

204
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,291
The idea of your efforts
always being fruitful

205
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,416
is really only a fairy tale.

206
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,916
Even so, Haseo
is doing his best.

207
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,125
Right now he's probably
all by himself in the forest.

208
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,583
Therefore, all
we can really do

209
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,541
is wait and hope for the best.

210
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:49,500
Yeah.

211
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,125
No matter what the outcome,

212
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,083
I'm certain Haseo
doesn't want to regret

213
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,958
having not tried his very best.

214
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,916
That's why he's fighting
on his own in the forest.

215
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,958
He's not looking for any reward.

216
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,625
I expect everything will
play itself out in the end.

217
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,458
Just believe in Haseo.

218
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,708
[TABBY]
Yeah.

219
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,875
[PHYLLO]
I'm going out for a bit.

220
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,125
Come on!

221
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,958
I didn't come all this way
to get a stupid weapon!

222
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,333
[HASEO screaming]

223
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,375
Master Yata?

224
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,333
[YATA]
He disappeared?

225
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,833
That's impossible!

226
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,166
Isn't it?

227
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,625
[YATA]
Interesting.

228
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,833
This is where
impossible things happen.

229
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,333
Only in The World.

230
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,125
[MALE VOICE]
I shall ask you a question.

231
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:44,083
[MALE VOICE]
Is my daughter safe and sound?

232
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,500
What are you talking about?

233
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,875
[MALE VOICE]
Answer me.

234
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,250
How should I know?
Wh-Who are you?

235
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,250
And who the heck
is your daughter?

236
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,916
[MALE VOICE] I shall not
bequeath those swords to you.

237
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:14,333
[choked screaming]

238
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,541
[PHYLLO] Even someone
like you, Taihaku of Icolo,

239
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,083
had a hard time
in the forest.

240
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,583
It was tougher than I imagined.

241
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,166
[TAIHAKU]
What kind of man is he?

242
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,250
[PHYLLO]
Huh?

243
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,500
[TAIHAKU]
It took me a long time

244
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,708
to realize you are the
same Phyllo from before.

245
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,750
Which reflects the depth
of our relationship.

246
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,166
Nevertheless, you,

247
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,375
who many call the
Mac Anu ornament,

248
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,125
or the teddy bear
on the bridge,

249
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,958
came all the way here.

250
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,750
There must be someone in the
forest you are concerned about.

251
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,166
That's right.

252
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,416
[TAIHAKU]
I won't push the question.

253
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,541
I hope your friend
comes back safely.

254
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,125
That player's
taken quite a beating,

255
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,125
so it's a good time to quit.

256
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,375
Well, that's my
opinion, anyway.

257
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,583
Hold on.

258
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,125
[PHYLLO]
Huh?

259
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,500
I've explained the
severity of that event.

260
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,291
And yet, you're perfectly fine

261
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,458
with letting your
friend fight alone?

262
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,833
How can you be so
dismissive of him...

263
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:32,583
...or her?

264
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,083
He's a boy.

265
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,458
It doesn't seem right

266
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,375
that you would disregard
that boy's earnest efforts.

267
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,708
There's something much worse

268
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,791
waiting for him once he
finally clears the forest.

269
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,625
Something truly terrible.

270
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,166
[TAIHAKU]
I don't know.

271
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,125
But if that's
the road he chose,

272
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:55,000
then no one has the right
to say anything about it.

273
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,875
[PHYLLO]
A game is a game.

274

The Net isn't
the same as reality.

275
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,750
And it just doesn't seem right
to link the two together,

276
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,166
no matter how tempting.

277
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,458
[TAIHAKU] Is that
what this is all about?

278
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:07,500
Right.

279
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,583
It's not an issue
I can figure out easily.

280

[PHYLLO] That large
sword you obtained...

281
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,250
Was it worth the
hardship in the forest?

I am sorry.

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,375

Hi there.

288
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,375
Why are you here?

289
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,458
You were really anxious
and worried about Haseo,

290
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,500
so I just thought
you might be here.

291
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:22,833
I see.

292
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,041
Is he still working
his way through the forest?

293
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,375
Yeah.

294
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,625
When he finally gets back,

295
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,291
I want to be the first
one to congratulate him.

296
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,750
I can at least do that.

297
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,791
I know it might
bug him a little,

298
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,166
but I thought that
I'd wait here anyway.

That's all it is.

Haseo must be very happy.

What?

302
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,916
To have such a
wonderful friend.

303
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,791
I don't know about that.

304
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,833
Haseo doesn't think
of me as his friend.

[SEISAKU]
Is that so?

306
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,583
[TABBY]
He thinks I'm annoying.

307

I don't understand why
you'd support him, then.

That's what I wanna do.

beginning to see it now.
