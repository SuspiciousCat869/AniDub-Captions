1
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,416
[HIDEYO] If you've
suffered injury...

2
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,083
[SEISAKU] Or been
defeated in battle...

3
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:03,791
[TABBY]
We wanna heal you!

4
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:04,750
We are--

5
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,625
Huh?

6
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,750
Wait, this isn't...

7
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,875
Retreat!

8
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,791
Hideyo!

9
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,916
Hey! How was your debut?

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,583
Looks like we gotta go
back to the drawing board.

11
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,416
[TOUTA/TAWARAYA]
What?

12
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,958
It's my
fault,I'm sorry...

13
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,291
It's not your fault Hideyo!

14
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,458
Look, we just gotta
build a stronger foundation.

15
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,250
Whoa, just
hold on a minute.

16
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,625
It seems to me you guys

17
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,458
might be
misunderstanding something.

18
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,583
Well we did think
of a catchphrase

19
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,250
just like you told us to.

20
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,791
Sorry about this, I've gotta
run but I'll see you later.

21
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,875
What is this thing?

22
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,166
[PI/ENDER]
Master Yata!

23
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:30,000
So, the second one
has been awakened.

24
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,708
Give me this PCs specs.

25
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,708
Yes.

26
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,500
Hmm? Like this?

27
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,916
Actually, I think it's better
if you hold your arm

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,958
out diagonally,
kind of like this!

29
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:44,291
And I do this?

30
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,750
Well you're in the middle,

31
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,583
so in my opinion
it would look better

32
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,875
if you kept it symmetrical.

33
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,875
Symmetrical?

34
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,125
It's the perfect
balance of left and right.

35
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,708
So... like this?

36
00:03:56,791 --> 00:04:00,250
Look at you guys!

37
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,625
It always seems
to work during practice.

38
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,583
But it was a total
mess in the field.

39
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,708
Hang on a second.

40
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,416
How come your
levels are all so low?

41
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,958
Well you can't blame
Hideyo--he just started.

42
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:16,625
And I've been focusing
on my role as a healer.

43
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,583
Yeah, so we
can't really help

44
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,750
being at a
low level right now.

45
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,250
What do you mean
you can't help it?!

46
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,416
Go out and raise
your levels at once.

47
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,416
Nothing starts
until that happens!

48
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,416
How do you expect to
go around helping adults

49
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,333
when all you have is the
strength of a three year old?

50
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,583
We're going now!

51
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:59,000
[KUHN] I don't understand...
what was that.

52
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,708
Do you have a moment?

53
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,041
You're confused about
your Player Character.

54
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,833
Is that what's
bothering you?

55
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,083
Ah, who are you?

56
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,166
An ally.

57
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,666
Just listen to me.

58
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,583
Your Player Character
is potentially dangerous.

59
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:24,041
You can cause trouble when
you involve those around you.

60
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,166
I came here to warn you.

61
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,208
Warn me?

62
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,083
Actually, to
recruit you.

63
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,958
Would you like
to join our guild?

64
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,875
What?

65
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,041
If you don't want
to endanger anyone else,

66
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:40,333
you should stay away
from your current guild.

67
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,916
You're saying
it's really that bad?

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,416
There's no telling if
and when you'll face

69
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,125
that strange
phenomenon again.

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,833
Here's my member address.

71
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:56,458
Contact me when you've decided
what you're going to do.

72
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,125
[PHYLLO] What do you
think you're doing,

73
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,875
acting like a loose cannon?

74
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,083
[HASEO] What's that
supposed to mean?

75
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,166
You're like some mad dog

76
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,250
Well Haseo,
isn't there something

77
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,208
you want to talk about?

78
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:38,500
Why don't you just
let things be for now?

79
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,916
Tri-Edge has disappeared,

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,208
and there's no telling
if or when he'll be back.

81
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,208
You should let
the hospital handle the rest.

82
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,791
It doesn't matter.

83
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:49,375
I still need
to track him down.

84
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,166
Let's say you
do find Tri-Edge.

85
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,625
You still won't be
able to get him to talk.

86
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,750
That's what I think.

87
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,375
You lost to that player,

88
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,041
the one who ran away
from Tri-Edge, didn't you?

89
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:05,458
It's not important.

90
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,416
Honestly it doesn't matter

91
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,708
whether or not
I won or lost to her.

92
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,250
My real enemy
now is Tri-Edge.

93
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,666
Him and only him.

94
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,750
That sounds like
a pitiful excuse to me.

95
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,458
If I can manage to
nail Tri-Edge down

96
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,250
then I don't care
about the rest.

97
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:29,750
Alright then, let's
just say it works.

98
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,625
Let's say you do manage

99
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,750
to pin down Tri-Edge
with your strength.

100
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,250
What then?

101
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:36,958
Do you think he's going to
tell you what you want to hear?

102
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:37,958
If he doesn't listen,

103
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,583
I'll follow him
until he answers me.

104
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,416
He'll just disappoint you.

105
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,166
What will you do if the
answer is not what you wanted?

106
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,250
You're dangerous right now.

107
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,041
What do you mean
I'm "dangerous"?

108
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:56,958
If your eyes are only on one
thing, if your focus is limited,

109
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,916
when something else happens

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,041
you won't be able
to deal with it.

111
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,041
That's what I mean
by "dangerous."

112
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,291
Something else huh?

113
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,916
Believe me.

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,791
There's no such thing.

115
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,250
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

116
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,291
Whatever!

117
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh yeah, you know what...

118
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,291
Huh?

119
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,541
Those goggles...

120
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,541
Yeah?

121
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,750
I was wondering,
why you need them?

122
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:34,708
Oh, those?

123
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,250
Seisaku told me he admires

124
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,000
the guild master of this
Twilight Brigade or whatever.

125
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,333
That's why he's wearing
the same goggles as that guy.

126
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,875
Why'd you tell her that?

127
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,125
Y'know, Ovan didn't
actually wear goggles.

128
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,125
He wore sunglasses.

129
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,291
They were red.

130
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,791
I guess I should
take them off.

131
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,791
Oh that's okay.

132
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,416
It doesn't
really matter much.

133
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,375
[GASPARD]
Oh, hey It's Kuhn!

134
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,916
Hey, you're here!

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,416
How you guys doing?

136
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,125
Can you take us
somewhere today?

137
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,250
Yeah, I'm up for that.

138
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,791
Anywhere you want!

139
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,083
Well as long
as you're with us,

140
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,125
we don't mind where we go!

141
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,083
What's the matter--are you
tired or something?

142
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,125
No. Not at all.

143
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,541
Then let's do something!

144
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,416
Okay, let's go
raise your levels.

145
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,625
--Alright!
--Sure.

146
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,375
Tabby, watch out!

147
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:20,291
Oh no! I won't
give up though!

148
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,583
I know if
I don't give up...

149
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,041
I'll kick butt!

150
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,583
Meow!

151
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,166
Hi...

152
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,083
Thanks a lot!

153
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,708
That was a big help!

154
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,083
Oh, it was nothing!

155
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,416
So, what are
you doin' here?

156
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,750
Trying to raise our levels.

157
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,000
What about you?

158
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,416
The same.

159
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,041
But don't you think
this place is too tough?

160
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,458
Well... yeah.

161
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,875
It's not effective
unless you train

162
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,833
in a field that fits
your own level.

163
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:01,833
Are those guys beginners?

164
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,458
Yeah, pretty much.

165
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,958
They're the
first recruits...

166
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,125
in the brand
new guild I started.

167
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,250
What was that?

168
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,875
Did you actually
create a guild?

169
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,250
Yeah!

170
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,416
The Paw Pad Squadron.

171
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,333
We heal players
from the sidelines.

172
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,000
Well that sounds
like a pretty tough job.

173
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,416
There are a lot of
Player Killers in this game.

174
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,125
Well there you go!

175
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,916
That's exactly why
I thought it was needed.

176
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,750
Master Yata,
about the awakened one...

177
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,458
I think it's going to take
a little more time and effort.

178
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,916
I see.

179
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,458
But I think...

180
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,583
He will definitely join us.

181
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,416
I don't see any
need to rush things

182
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,833
You know what?

183
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,250
The Twilight Brigade
used to meet here often.

184
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,375
Really?

185
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:18,000
We gotta keep at it, right?

186
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,750
So you're not afraid?

187
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,583
No I'm not.

188
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:25,375
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

189
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,250
My sister always
says the same thing.

190
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,708
Your sister?

191
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,833
You've never
mentioned you had a sister.

192
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:36,583
That's 'cuz we
don't really get along.

193
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:41,416
Actually, I guess you can
say that about my whole family.

194
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,041
Don't feel bad.

195
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:47,125
I think it's pretty
similar everywhere.

196
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,333
Your family doesn't
get along either?

197
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,208
Yeah, well you know...

198
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,416
we manage somehow.

199
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,250
A family that gets
along sounds so nice.

200
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,458
I really admire that.

201
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,791
Oh what am I talking about?

202
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,541
This place is so amazing!

203
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:20,791
Are you okay?

204
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,750
Hey wait... why
don't we be a family?

205
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,416
The Paw Pad Squadron.

206
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,833
I don't understand.

207
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:31,916
No matter how
uncertain things are,

208
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,791
a family would
stick together, right?

209
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:39,875
That's a little different.

210
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,541
I promise at the very least...

211
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,500
I know I won't run away.

212
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:48,083
Don't worry,
I trust you about that.

213
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,083
Let's go back.

214
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,750
Tabby?

215
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,375
Let's meet...
I mean in the real world.

216
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,916
Huh?

217
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,583
I think as far as
your loneliness goes...

218
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,958
I'm pretty sure I can
help take your mind off it.

219
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,583
You've called me out here...

220
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,666
does this mean you've
decided to join our guild?

221
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,916
Well...

222
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,083
So you haven't
accepted the truth yet?

223
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,041
Not really.

224
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,625
There's definitely
something strange about my PC.

225
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,708
But y'know, that whole
thing you told me

226
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,625
about causing trouble by
involving other players,

227
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,750
I can't imagine
it happening.

228
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,916
You're telling words are not
enough to convince you, right?

229
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,833
Well, yeah.

230
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:42,375
Fine then. Come with me.

231
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,333
So I guess I'm playing
the mother, huh?

232
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,833
That feels
really weird to me.

233
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,416
Well, you are
the guild's birth mother.

234
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,458
I guess so.

235
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,500
But then who's
the dad gonna be?

236
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,791
That's obvious!

237
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,041
Who? Who?

238
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:07,250
Will it be... Seisaku?

239
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,791
Mr. Touta!

240
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,833
What is that?

241
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,083
It's the same phenomenon

242
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,666
as the thing
that attacked you.

243
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,041
What is it? A monster?

244
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,291
They are anomalies

245
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,916
that have recently been
identified in The World.

246
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,833
A bug.

247
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:50,916
What?

248
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,625
And it's known to
be very dangerous.

249
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,583
So, it's a bug that's in me?

250
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,166
No, the thing that
lives in your PC body

251
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,625
is something different...

252
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,583
a very special power.

253
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,958
A special power?

254
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,083
Yes.

255
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,583
And it's also a very
dangerous quality.

256
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:26,875
You had better
move away from me!

257
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,458
I know the spells
and techniques

258
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,166
that are needed
to control this power.

259
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,125
But... you at the moment
don't know them.

260
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:50,583
Try to imagine the effects
of a power you can't control.

261
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:55,041
The results could
be catastrophic.

262
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,541
I think it looks kinda lame.

263
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,083
Yeah you're right.

264
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:09,125
Okay. I think... you should
follow Haseo around.

265
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,833
Why Haseo?

266
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,416
The plan is, you're gonna
go revive the players

267
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,000
that Haseo has killed...

268
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,708
and heal Haseo
whenever he gets hurt.

269
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:21,250
That way you'll become
the talk of the town.

270
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,958
I totally get it!

271
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,000
Let's do it then!

272
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,583
Hey!

273
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,416
Finished with your errands?

274
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,833
Yeah.

275
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,041
Great.

276
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,125
Then can we go hang out?

277
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,833
What's wrong?

278
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,250
Hey yeah, what's
the matter Kuhn?

279
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,916
Nothing.

280
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,583
Please tell us if
there's anything at all

281
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,833
we can do for you.

282
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,625
It's nothing like that.

283
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:33,208
I, umm... think
I'm gonna leave this guild.

284
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,541
But how come?

285
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:38,875
I'm really sorry
for being selfish

286
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,875
and quitting all
of a sudden, but--

287
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,416
No, I don't want you to!

288
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,416
I just can't accept that.

289
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,458
It looks like I might be
involved in something strange.

290
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,166
That's why I need to go.

291
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,666
Huh?

292
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,791
What do you mean by
"something strange"?

293
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,500
I don't know
how to explain it.

294
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,625
My PC is not in line with the
system or something like that.

295
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:05,166
Anyway, I don't want
to get you guys involved.

296
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,375
What about us?

297
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:10,250
Can't we do anything to help?

298
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,625
I know it's not cool

299
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,583
to be leaving a guild
I created myself

300
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,500
and I'm really sorry.

301
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,833
But I hope you
can understand.

302
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,416
No!

303
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,916
I don't want to be in a stupid
guild if you're not in it too!

304
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,500
It's not fair...
I'm gonna leave with you! 

305
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,416
Gaspard.

306
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,916
Kuhn!

307
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,625
You know it might be quite
dangerous if you come with me.

308
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,416
Sure it's hard to take.

309
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,416
I want you guys to be able
to play this game normally.

310
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,083
I don't quite understand.

311
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:46,750
But if you say it's serious...
then I trust you.

312
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:50,291
I'm glad, Thanks.

313
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:02,458
Can you take over this guild?

314
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,833
Yes I can.

315
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,291
And Gaspard's with me.

316
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:12,208
Gaspard, I'm sorry.

317
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,166
C'mon, don't cry.

318
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,375
Promise me that...

319
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,416
you'll come back
whenever you want to.

320
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,583
Okay, Kuhn?

321
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,666
Yeah.

322
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,000
Repth!

323
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,708
If you've been injured...

324
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,375
or defeated in battle...

325
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,208
We're here to heal you!

326
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,708
We serve...to regenerate.

327
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,208
Paw Pad Squadron!

328
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,000
What are you doing?

329
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,291
Get lost!

330
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,625
Here you go Haseo!

331
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:02,666
[HASEO]
Hey!

332
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,708
I've decided this
is what I want to do!

333
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,750
And?

334
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:21,166
You're making people miserable
by being so pushy like that.

335
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,750
You should calm down.

336
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,750
It's none of your business!

337
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,208
Dead people are no
longer useful to you.

338
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:31,166
So, there shouldn't be a problem
if we revive them, right?

339
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,875
You know what?

340
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,375
Bye-bye!

341
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,291
Idiots!

342
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,208
Hey, did you guys read
that weird e-mail?

343
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,875
The one about TaN's hidden
items being lent out for free?

344
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,500
You guys got that too?

345
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:10,083
It's risky but you know it might
be good for eliminating stress.

346
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,500
Wouldn't your
account get suspended?

347
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:12,916
Don't you get it?

348
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,708
You'd be acting as
their secret service.

349
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,916
So, what are you gonna do?

350
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,166
Shhhhh.
