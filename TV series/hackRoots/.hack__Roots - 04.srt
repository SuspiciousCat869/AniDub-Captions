1
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,875
[PHYLLO] 
Well young Haseo...

2
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:05,791
What's your role going to be?

3
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,333
[Nazo Grunty] Whaddya
go and do that for?

4
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,458
[SAKISAKA] Because
you were in the way!

5
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,416
[TABBY] Hey, come and join us.

6
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,083
[HASEO] Ah thanks, but
I'm fine where I am.

7
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,666
If you stand there,

8
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,458
you'll get in the way
of people coming in.

9
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:37,458
I can walk by myself.

10
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,291
Okay, let's go!

11
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,791
I was wondering

12
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,416
Wondering what?

13
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,875
Why on earth did you guys join

14
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,250
this guild in the first place?

15
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,125
Why'd I join?

16
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,125
Because I was asked to!

17
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,250
So, you're telling me you joined

18
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,916
just 'cuz you were invited?

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,833
And because Shino's so nice!

20
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:03,416
And you?

21
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,541
The same reason as that girl.

22
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,416
I'm not "that girl."

23
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,250
My name happens to be Tabby,

24
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,250
in case you didn't know.

25
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,791
Hey, what about you?

26
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,541
Why did you decided to join the
Twilight Brigade, Sakisaka?

27
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,041
Who, me?

28
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,833
Yeah! Tell me.

29
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:28,250
Is it that hard to remember?

30
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,875
You had a crush on
Shino, didn't you?

31
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,375
Whatever!

32
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,000
It's 'cuz Shino's
so kind and pretty!

33
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:38,041
I understand how you feel.

34
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,708
Would you cut it out?

35
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,916
[BSET] What are you looking at?

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,625
Well, well, so it's you.

37
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,958
What... did you
think I was the kid?

38
00:03:55,333 --> 00:04:00,541
I heard Haseo has decided to
join the Twilight Brigade.

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,458
Do you want to rejoin a guild
run by that strange,

40
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,208
eccentric man?

41
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,458
What are you kidding?

42
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:10,083
I'm relieved I was able to get
outta there.

43
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,291
Well then, what is it?

44
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,250
I really don't know.

45
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,333
It wasn't like Gord or I were
invited to be there.

46
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:23,500
I just feel...

47
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:27,750
...a little disturbed.

48
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,666
Disturbed huh?

49
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:38,791
Honestly, I'm a little
jealous of Haseo.

50
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:39,416
So, you've come to complain.

51
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,583
Well...

52
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,541
You hardly ever leave
the Alchemy Area,

53
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,458
so I'm pretty sure there must be

54
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,750
something else on your mind.

55
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,500
Maybe I'm
imagining things, but--

56
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,916
Huh?

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,791
I don't know.

58
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,416
Maybe I'm just tired.

59
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,833
You're not making
yourself very clear.

60
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,541
Have there been any
bugs in the game lately?

61
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:04,583
Like the graphics
being distorted

62
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,083
or the sound being muted
all of a sudden.

63
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,250
My friend was saying
the same thing.

64
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,041
I don't know.

65
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,291
With the game going in
a strange direction,

66
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,291
maybe there isn't any
reason to be worried

67
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:19,000
about something
like bugs anyway.

68
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,500
Well, there have
been lots of rumors.

69
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,583
What's really going on?

70
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,625
I wonder...

71
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,083
So do you think we should

72
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,916
continue playing here
like this, Phyllo?

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,208
Up you go!

74
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,041
Up you go!

75
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,083
Up, up!

76
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,750
Where is he?

77
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,333
Oh!

78
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,208
He left while you were off in
the bathroom for all that time.

79
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:46,958
Ovan called for him to come.

80
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:51,000
Does that bother you?

81
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,500
Not really

82
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,125
[SHINO] The rumors...

83
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,208
they're starting
to spread faster.

84
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,750
[OVAN] Don't worry
about that Shino.

85
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,416
Yes, but Ovan...

86
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,125
Someday someone will realize.

87
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,250
I do agree, but...

88
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,375
How can you stay so calm?

89
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:24,583
I wouldn't want to act in haste
and make a mistake.

90
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,916
Right.

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,208
Is it really okay for me

92
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,750
to take Haseo to "that place"?

93
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,083
I don't mind.

94
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,416
I wonder if he's
already been there.

95
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,000
I doubt it.

96
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,166
It's a very special place.

97
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,458
Where are we?

98
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,666
It's unusual, isn't it?

99
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,041
Not really.

100
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,333
So, what is it you want?

101
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:11,458
Yeah, what is that?

102
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,208
A special item
I want you to have.

103
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:21,708
For me?

104
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,958
Please, don't lose it.

105
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,083
[TAWARAYA] I already told you
not to accept that order!

106
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:34,583
[ENDER] This isn't like you.

107
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:38,500
Look, this is just
another one of the hassles

108
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,833
that comes with
having a large guild.

109
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,416
But really, there's no order

110
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,000
that you can't take,
isn't that right?

111
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,000
If it's rare we can make
it or steal it or something.

112
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,583
We're talking about
the Key of the Twilight.

113
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,666
Huh?

114
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,833
Haseo.

115
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,250
Even some of the core players

116
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,875
have their noses out of joint

117
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:00,000
because he decided to
join the Twilight Brigade.

118
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,500
You mean there are other
players who want him?

119
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:12,583
Well now I hafta
wonder why Ovan...

120
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:26,250
Well now I hafta
wonder why Ovan...

121
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,166
Wanted Haseo?

122
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,166
Why don't you go and ask Naobi?

123
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,458
I'm very interested to know your
opinion, Tawaraya.

124
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,500
Wouldn't you prefer
someone a bit more useful?

125
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:37,750
A beginner is only
a--an extra burden.

126
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:42,625
An Adept Rogue.

127
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,041
I believe Ovan needs
an Adept Rogue player

128
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,291
in order to get his
hands on the key...

129
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,916
You agree?

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,208
Sure, there aren't many,

131
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,916
and they're hard to come by...

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,291
But I have a couple of
Adept Rogues under my command.

133
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,750
You have a point there.

134
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:06,250
I wonder what this Haseo guy
could possibly have to offer.

135
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,541
Anyway, I'm gonna go see

136
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,583
what's going on with the new
headquarters.

137
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,375
[NAOBI] Ender.

138
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,208
Don't take your eyes off the
Twilight Brigade.

139
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,125
Huh?

140
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:28,291
Be extremely cautious and
watch their every move.

141
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,125
I understand.

142
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,666
Hurry up everybody!

143
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,208
We're gonna announce
this new area very soon!

144
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,916
It's important
that we understand

145
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,625
we shouldn't act too quickly

146
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,541
before we really
know what's going on.

147
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:58,166
True or false, the rumors still
hold valuable information,

148
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,416
so we should look into them
further.

149
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,791
It's important to
enjoy the process.

150
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,166
So, the search
should not be hastened.

151
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,541
I'm just sick of hearing it.

152
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,500
Certainly you've been in our
guild long enough.

153
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,625
I have a question!

154
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,458
So, what are we supposed to do?

155
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,083
Should we all go
looking for clues?

156
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,416
Right now you need to work on

157
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,250
advancing your levels
with the help of Sakisaka.

158
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,250
Okay!

159
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,083
Let's go!

160
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,125
Right now?

161
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,666
Better now than never?

162
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,583
Don'tcha think?

163
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,291
What are you talking about!

164
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:33,958
Hey, wait!

165
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,166
Come on!

166
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,083
Wait a second!

167
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:36,750
Hey!

168
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,916
You two have fun!

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,791
What about me?

170
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,500
Oh don't worry; you will be
coming with me.

171
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,583
Oh? And Ovan?

172
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,250
I'll join you later.

173
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,083
Well Haseo...

174
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,833
Shall we go?

175
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,916
It's big, isn't it?

176
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,416
You'll find this place

177
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,916
is much different from
the normal game area.

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,666
How exactly is it different?

179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,291
Well... come in!

180
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,833
So, there are no monsters here?

181
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,625
That's right.

182
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,208
There used to be a statue
of a girl here

183
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,500
but that was a very
long time ago.

184
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,416
A girl?

185
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,125
Yes, Aura.

186
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,083
That is the name
they used to call her.

187
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,166
So why isn't she there anymore?

188
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,750
Who knows...

189
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:18,208
Maybe she just lost
interest in the end...

190
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,208
Lost hope for this world.

191
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,666
What does that mean?

192
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,666
I mean...

193
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,041
What I want to know is...

194
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,375
what is this place for?

195
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,125
The Lost Ground.

196
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,291
The Lost... what?

197
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,958
It's the Lost Ground.

198
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,291
A place that is nowhere to be
found.

199
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:38,708
There are no monsters;

200
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,458
even the
administrator can't touch it.

201
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:44,583
It's a mysterious area.

202
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,750
The Arche Koeln
Waterfall is the same.

203
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,750
You mean that waterfall
we were just at?

204
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,708
Yes.

205
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:54,583
You said no one can touch it...

206
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,666
You mean it can't
even be erased?

207
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,041
It seems that way.

208
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,041
Just when you've forgotten about
a Lost Ground,

209
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,916
another one may be
revealed unexpectedly.

210
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,333
What do you mean?

211
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,166
Regular players
stumble upon them

212
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,208
from time to time.

213
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,750
This is a weird game.

214
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:15,083
That's right, Haseo.

215
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,500
It's important to recognize this
game

216
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,583
has a very mysterious autonomy.

217
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:22,291
Autonomy?

218
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,500
Neither the
system administrator

219
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,041
nor any other
entity can control it.

220
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,083
In fact, parts of The World
are completely governed

221
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,416
by the rules of the game itself.

222
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't get it.

223
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:36,791
In other words,
the Key of the Twilight

224
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:41,541
is not created by a programmer
or the system administrator.

225
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:47,083
It's a phenomenon that was truly
created by The World itself.

226
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,625
But does it truly exist?

227
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,083
It does.

228
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,458
You must play this game

229
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,458
with the assumption
that it does exist.

230
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,708
That is why we are known
as the Twilight Brigade.

231
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,291
Is it real?

232
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,083
Suppose it's real...

233
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,291
Then it'll be more exciting.

234
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,500
Oh.

235
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,333
Excuse me.

236
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,750
You've been asked to check out
this Player Character.

237
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:33,125
You can go ahead and bring him
in.

238
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,500
But when you do,
make sure the others

239
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,250
around us don't
hear anything.

240
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,750
Yes, of course.

241
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,333
And emphasize
the fact we don't take

242
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,583
responsibility for
anything that happens.

243
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,000
And compensation
will be advanced

244
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,916
exactly as the manual says.

245
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,333
Do you understand?

246
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,000
I understand.

247
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,708
Fix.

248
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,666
Okay.

249
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,750
You're climbing the
levels very quickly.

250
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,875
Well, I don't know
if I can agree.

251
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,708
Or maybe, it's just
because I'm here to heal you.

252
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,250
I never asked you to.

253
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,416
Is that so?

254
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,666
Okay, I won't do it ever again.

255
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,791
Hey, isn't this area
too tough for me?

256
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,875
You won't get stronger fighting

257
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,250
with something that
is weaker than you.

258
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,375
Don't you agree?

259
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,750
Well, I guess you
got a point there.

260
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,250
Become stronger.

261
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:44,666
I'm going on ahead.

262
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,791
I don't like being
bothered with formalities,

263
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,666
so I won't beat
around the bush.

264
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,958
I need you to tell me
everything you know

265
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,416
about the Key of the Twilight.

266
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,375
I don't know.

267
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,000
I don't know anything.

268
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,625
What do you mean you
don't know anything?

269
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:08,916
The Twilight Brigade was--

270
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,583
No wait! Not here.

271
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:18,291
I don't want people to
know I was in that brigade.

272
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,166
So, what does the notorious
Ender want from me?

273
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,875
You know who I am and you still
brought me here?

274
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,791
I just told you;
I don't know anything.

275
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,958
I never did find out...

276
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,500
Then how could you have
been a member of that brigade?

277
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,583
That's why I left.

278
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,916
Then who knows the information?

279
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,875
I wonder if any of
them knows anything.

280
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,166
Even Ovan seemed to
be groping for answers.

281
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,625
Are you guys all idiots?

282
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,500
Don't count me with them.

283
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,541
I told you already,
I'm not a part of it.

284
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,583
If you want to know anything

285
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:06,958
go and ask one of
the current members.

286
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,000
Did you have
to be somewhere?

287
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:12,166
If we meet in the field,
remember me.

288
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,291
Oh I'll remember.

289
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,083
That was scary.

290
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,500
[GORD] It's been awhile.

291
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,666
Hey!

292
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,291
Hey, Gord!

293
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,833
You haven't changed a bit!

294
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,208
Who is this guy, Sakisaka?

295
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,500
It's Gord.

296
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,916
He used to be in the Brigade.

297
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,291
It's very nice
to meet you, Gord!

298
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,916
I'm Tabby.

299
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,833
So, you're a newbie.

300
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,083
What happened with Haseo?

301
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:12,333
Wait a second.

302
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,583
How do you know about Haseo?

303
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,416
I met him.

304
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,708
He asked me some
questions about the brigade.

305
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:22,333
So then you are Haseo's friend?

306
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,541
No.

307
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,625
You could say he's
kinda like my pupil.

308
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,375
Pupil?

309
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,125
Listen, I would love
to stay and chat,

310
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,041
but we're gonna
have to do it later.

311
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,541
I've got somewhere to be.

312
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,458
See ya later!

313
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,583
Haseo sure seems to
have a lot of contacts.

314
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,041
What about you?

315
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,208
About me?

316
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,541
Your contacts.

317
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,000
Umm...

318
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:52,750
Sakisaka and... Shino and...

319
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,166
I'm one of them, huh?

320
00:18:54,250 --> 00:19:01,083
What's up with that?

321
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,125
Who exactly is Haseo?

322
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,541
Seriously, c'mon!

323
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:11,291
I mean what's so
special about him anyway?

324
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,916
You know something?

325
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,458
I'm special, too!

326
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,250
Why are we the only ones

327
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,791
who have to advance our levels?

328
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,208
Who cares?

329
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,041
I bet you anything
Haseo has gone off

330
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:27,500
somewhere else with
Ovan... without us.

331
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,083
Are you serious?

332
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,625
You are serious?

333
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:34,083
I'm telling you,
we've just been sidelined.

334
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:34,916
No, silly!

335
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Shino isn't like that.

336
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,250
You just don't get it.

337
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:44,166
Why do I have to be stuck
with someone so freakin' silly?

338
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,166
Sakisaka, I am not silly!

339
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,583
You're late.

340
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,541
My fault, sorry.

341
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,750
You're the one who
called me and you're late.

342
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,375
Who do you think you are?

343
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,083
I'm gonna need some
backdoor work done.

344
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,375
What kind?

345
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,166
You know, just the usual stuff.

346
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,500
But make sure you find out

347
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,583
without getting yourself caught.

348
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,583
What about compensation?

349
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,583
Unfortunately, our guild does
not have the wonderful system

350
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,500
of personally advancing
compensation.

351
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,916
Even though there's the risk

352
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
my account might
actually be suspended?

353
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,791
Well that's business.

354
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:39,166
And Ender...

355
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,500
What else?

356
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,833
I want you to
warn the manufacturers

357
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:46,375
that the distribution
has become too large.

358
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,583
Isn't it supply and demand?

359
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,416
Well yes it is, in principal.

360
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,583
But we can't become too visible.

361
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,541
Considering we did get
this great big building.

362
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,375
I'll warn them,
but you know they're not

363
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,250
the types who listen very well.

364
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,791
That'll depend on
how you deal with them.

365
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,458
Yeah. Yeah.

366
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,916
Where are Ovan and Shino?

367
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,625
They went somewhere.

368
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,583
Haseo, what were you up to

369
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,875
before you joined the guild?

370
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,833
What do you mean?

371
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,666
You talked to Gord, right?

372
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,166
How come?

373
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,916
No reason.

374
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,291
No reason?

375
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:47,416
I won't let you off that easily.

376
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,041
Get your hands off me!

377
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,000
What exactly,
did you come here for?

378
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,458
That's none of
your business.

379
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,750
Look I'm a member
of the Twilight Brigade,

380
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:02,250
so of course it's my business!

381
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,750
Dude, you know it's just a game,

382
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,291
why don't you chill out.

383
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,541
You punk!

384
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,916
It's Tabby...

385
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,083
A Player Killer got her.
