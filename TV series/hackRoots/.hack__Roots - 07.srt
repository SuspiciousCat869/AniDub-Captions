1
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:10,500
[TAWARAYA] Do you have
some good info for me?

2
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,125
Come on now,
why would you bring me

3
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,541
all the way out here if
you have nothing to say?

4
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:16,958
Do you think
I have the time,

5
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,375
the patience, or
the desire just to hang out?

6
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,958
[SAKISAKA]
You can have it back.

7
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:24,958
Why?

8
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,500
All of a sudden...

9
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,166
I...

10
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,375
Huh?

11
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,500
I don't want anything
more to do with you.

12
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,541
What?

13
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,375
See ya.

14
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,250
You're gonna regret this.

15
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,500
No. I won't.

16
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,458
We'll see.

17
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,708
You better
take care of that.

18
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,166
What's the matter with him?

19
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,666
[SHINO] This is a problem.

20
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,750
There's nothing we
can do about the past.

21
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:57,916
Sakisaka, come on!

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,583
What?

23
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,625
You're the problem.

24
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:00,666
When I specifically
told you not to,

25
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,916
you went on the attack.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,625
[TABBY] Now what
are we gonna do?

27
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,833
We're only
really safe in here.

28
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:10,291
If we're out in the field
we might get attacked.

29
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,125
If we're in town,
where we think it's safe,

30
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,458
we might be followed.

31
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,375
They're gonna hunt us
and now I'm really scared.

32
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,833
Oh well, even if something
happens I think we'll be okay!

33
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,416
Why d'ya say that?

34
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,458
Because silly, I know I'll be
fine if I just stick with you!

35
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,000
Even then, you're going
to need to be very careful.

36
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,500
Of course!

37
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,041
And Haseo will come right
away if I email him for help!

38
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:39,791
[HASEO] What?

39
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:40,833
Well, you did.

40
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:41,666
Remember?

41
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,666
But that was...

42
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,500
You don't have
to be embarrassed!

43
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:48,833
It's not like you acted
like a knight in shining armor.

44
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,625
But it still made me
happy that you came.

45
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,333
Remember, RCDC!

46
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,666
Check everything twice!

47
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,666
Huh? RCDC?

48
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,916
Report. Communicate.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,041
Discuss and Check.

50
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,291
Most importantly, everyone
has to be sure to communicate.

51
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,166
Okay?

52
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,208
10-4.

53
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,208
Okay!

54
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,625
Haseo, you understand?

55
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,375
Yeah. RCDC.

56
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,541
And remember to check twice.

57
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,125
Hey, have you noticed there
are a lot of TaN members around?

58
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:19,916
Yeah.

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,500
Maybe something happened.

60
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,375
[BSET] Something
did happen, didn't it?

61
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,333
See that?

62
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,708
Maybe the rumor that TaN

63
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,625
is trying to mislead
the Brigade is true.

64
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,750
[PHYLLO] It certainly
seems to have

65
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,750
something to do with
the Key of the Twilight.

66
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,916
I wonder if... maybe
they found a clue or something.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,041
Does that bother you?

68
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:43,166
No, I wouldn't say so.

69
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,250
There's been something
wrong about the Brigade

70
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,375
ever since
Haseo showed up.

71
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,666
Now, do you really
think the Brigade

72
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,458
has gone awry
because of Haseo?

73
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,666
No.

74
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,833
The guild was created
by an eccentric man.

75
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,500
Perhaps there was
something wrong

76
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:02,833
with the Brigade
to begin with.

77
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:03,958
My understanding
was that's the reason

78
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,000
you left them
in the first place.

79
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,416
I don't know if there's
anything I can say to that.

80
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,291
[GORD] Boy that was too easy...

81
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,125
Gord! It's me! It's me!

82
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,458
Oh.

83
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,166
Wow, looks like you
really creamed those guys.

84
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,166
They weren't even good
enough for practice.

85
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,875
So, what is it that you want?

86
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,708
I have some information
on the "problem item."

87
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,750
What have you got?

88
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,250
Oh, you know,
nothing really.

89
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,416
Although, I'm pretty
sure it has something to do

90
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,208
with the Key of the Twilight,
but I could be wrong.

91
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,583
Besides I think
it was only a rumor.

92
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,416
I must... defeat Ovan.

93
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,125
I might know who
has the problem item.

94
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,083
Aren't ya curious?

95
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,000
How much do you want?

96
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,500
A big 5-O.

97
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,791
50 grand huh?

98
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:00,666
If it turns out to
be garbage, you'll be sorry!

99
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,541
Hey, on my way here
I heard of a Player Killer

100
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,000
who's specifically targeting
members of the Twilight Brigade.

101
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,416
I heard about that too.

102
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,250
I think it's
someone from our guild.

103
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,500
Seriously?

104
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,166
But we just got access
to our exclusive area.

105
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,375
That can't be true.

106
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,208
Why doesn't Mr. Tawaraya

107
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,375
just put an end to
the rumors right away?

108
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,583
Yeah, really.

109
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,500
They don't have the
Key of the Twilight,

110
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,500
so how can they be called
the "Twilight Brigade"?

111
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,958
Yeah.

112
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,708
Screw this.

113
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,541
[ENDER] Fine.

114
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,583
But I don't really like
working out in the open.

115
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,208
Well, it's not like
you to be concerned.

116
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,000
[NAOBI] So, how's it going?

117
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,750
I carefully fed the bait
to the Twilight Brigade,

118
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,166
but nobody seems
to wanna bite.

119
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,458
Maybe I should try
some other approach.

120
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,458
If you let me do
some follow up,

121
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,833
I'll put the pressure on.

122
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,291
Nice and heavy.

123
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,416
You might want to leave the
business affairs up to me.

124
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,416
Y'know, I wasn't
offering to help you

125
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,083
or worry about
you, Tawaraya.

126
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,083
Either way, it doesn't matter.

127
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,208
As long as you
maintain a low profile

128
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,500
and nobody knows you're part of
TaN,

129
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm pretty sure we'll be fine.

130
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,625
And if they already know?

131
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,708
What? Are you
telling me that they do?

132
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,625
Even if they know who
Ender is it won't be a problem.

133
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:19,416
TaN can't be shaken
so easily, correct?

134
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,791
Yeah, of course.

135
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,333
Well, for now why don't
I just shake up the Brigade.

136
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,708
Certainly, and
let them show us

137
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:28,666
the way to the Key
of the Twilight.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,833
Hey, Teacher!

139
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:40,708
What?

140
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,083
What about Ovan?

141
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,416
Isn't he gonna do anything
about this situation?

142
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,458
Nope, he's not
gonna do anything.

143
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,791
It seems to me that
for the most part

144
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,583
Shino's more like
the guild master.

145
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:58,333
Where did Haseo go?

146
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,583
I'd say he's probably gone to
check out that information.

147
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,083
He should know by now that it's
way too dangerous to go alone.

148
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,916
We should've gone
with him too.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,583
I guess he forgot
about RCDC.

150
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,833
You're right.

151
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,666
Haseo doesn't like to
discuss anything.

152
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,125
What are you doing?

153
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,666
I was watching you.

154
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,791
Why are you standing there?

155
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,125
No reason.

156
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,041
You're in the way.

157
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,125
You mind moving?

158
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,250
Uhh...

159
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,291
What?

160
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:49,541
Well... um... nothing.

161
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:55,541
If you get stuck, start looking
in the places you can go to.

162
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,666
Huh?

163
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,333
That's what I did.

164
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:02,916
What am I doing, giving
advice to a newbie?

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,375
I'm not even a guild
member anymore.

166
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,833
Did you predict
this situation?

167
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,416
[OVAN] What do you
mean "this situation"?

168
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,750
The pressure from TaN.

169
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:31,666
Are you sure this is the
scenario you were hoping for?

170
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,791
You're acquainted with Naobi?

171
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,166
Can't you speak to him?

172
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,833
It's already gone too far

173
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,833
and pretty soon I think
it will be unbearable.

174
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,208
It's nothing I can't
handle at this point,

175
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:48,000
but I feel bad for Haseo and
Tabby 'cause they're new.

176
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,000
They'll have to deal with it,
sooner or later.

177
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,500
What do you mean?

178
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,625
It just means
we're in the process

179
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,166
of getting closer to our goal.

180
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,416
I have to go back to work
for a little while.

181
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,375
Are you in trouble for being
absent from work so often?

182
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,416
Well, I...

183
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,291
It's hard to explain.

184
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,083
I understand.

185
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,000
I like to think that I know
about your work after all.

186
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,958
You'll take charge
while I'm away...

187
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:25,916
We should just proceed
in our usual manner, right?

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,500
I'll leave it to you.

189
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,708
If we know the whereabouts of
the rest of the Virus Cores...

190
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,208
Where should we investigate?

191
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,500
At the Lost Grounds.

192
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:36,041
The rest doesn't matter.

193
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,500
Only the four of us?

194
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,750
Only the three.

195
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,083
What about me?

196
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,333
You?

197
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:47,875
Wait for my communication.

198
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,333
Hey, got a sec?

199
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,083
What is it?

200
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,500
You have something
rare and valuable,

201
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,500
and I'm here to
steal it from you.

202
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,416
You're here to
steal it from me?

203
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,916
I didn't think
you're a thief.

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,375
Now if I just asked you for
it would you give it to me?

205
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,666
What are you talking about?

206
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,750
Old man, don't hide it.

207
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,791
I already know you
have it, so give it up!

208
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,791
Alright then. Follow me.

209
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,666
Boy, if that's all you got...

210
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,166
How do you expect
to "defeat Ovan"?

211
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,791
If you really want to know,

212
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,625
I don't even have
the item anymore.

213
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,041
W-What?

214
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,083
You're insolent and I thought
you could stand to learn

215
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,666
a little lesson about
respecting your elders.

216
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,375
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

217
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,250
I know who has it though.

218
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,125
I can't believe this!

219
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,000
You're not gonna tell
me the truth, are you?

220
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,375
Relax, I'm getting to that.

221
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,291
The Brigade has found
all but half of the items

222
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,125
that have been
discovered so far.

223
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,291
So there is more
than one Virus Core?

224
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,958
That's what I've heard.

225
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,250
TaN apparently has one too.

226
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,708
Where's the one that you had?

227
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,208
I gave it to Shino.

228
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,250
I'm sure the Brigade is
taking good care of it.

229
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,708
Aren't there any more?

230
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,958
Sadly, I'm not blessed with
that kind of information.

231
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,291
But I've heard there
are as many Virus Cores

232
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,833
as there are "Lost Grounds."

233
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,625
Lost Grounds?

234
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:24,625
Five.

235
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:28,166
No, another one
was found, so six.

236
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,583
Okay, if you get any
information, you tell me!

237
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:37,166
Is that how you ask
a favor from someone?

238
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,208
I'm not so good at being humble!

239
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,541
Well, you certainly aren't!

240
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,458
So, they say this item
isn't in the specs.

241
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,875
Weird.

242
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,875
Meow!

243
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:06,666
Hey?

244
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,833
Huh?

245
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,875
I was just thinking
about the other day.

246
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,333
What...

247
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,333
are you talking about that
meteor shower-like incident?

248
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,583
Yeah.

249
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,416
If that was a monster
that drops Virus Cores,

250
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,000
then we just let it slip
through our fingers.

251
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,958
It could be but
I really don't think so.

252
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,291
I've never heard of a monster
that can disintegrate weapons.

253
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,916
To be totally honest I don't
have any idea what it was.

254
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,750
But... couldn't
that be why it might

255
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,958
be connected to the item
that's not listed in the specs?

256
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,666
No, of course not.

257
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,000
It's more like...

258
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,416
More like what?

259
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,875
You know!

260
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,791
Something along the lines of...

261
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,666
menacing or sinister...

262
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,791
I don't get it.

263
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,500
Oh man, I don't know.

264
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,875
Did something happen?

265
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,208
I suppose if nothing happened,

266
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,833
you wouldn't be here, would you?

267
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,541
I guess so.

268
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,833
Tell me.

269
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,458
I'm realizing this game...

270
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,708
...has a lot of bugs.

271
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:09,791
Why?

272
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,333
What did you see?

273
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,833
Just now all of a sudden there
was this disturbance.

274
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,416
It's happened before.

275
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,000
Maybe it's nothing to
be worried about.

276
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,583
Well, there have been rumors
about stuff like that happening.

277
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:27,166
Nevertheless... for now
they're just rumors.

278
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,416
I understand.

279
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Besides that, how have
you been doing lately?

280
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,166
What do you mean?

281
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,916
There are more blogs
about the Brigade

282
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,875
than there are
mysterious rumors.

283
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:42,666
Well, an eccentric
man like Ovan

284
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,750
is quite likely to
attract attention.

285
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,041
Did someone contact you?

286
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,541
Umm...

287
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,625
Yes?

288
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,791
Do you think...
oh, never mind.

289
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,333
Hey...

290
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,916
Whenever you find me here,

291
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,458
I'm more than happy to give any
advice you might be looking for.

292
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,500
Yeah. Thanks.

293
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,166
See ya later.

294
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,791
Haseo, you're always late.

295
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,250
So?

296
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,333
Okay, we're all here now.

297
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,583
You're going to begin searching
for the Virus Cores again.

298
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,083
You'll concentrate your search
on the Lost Grounds.

299
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:23,125
Never mind, it's nothing.

300
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,750
Shino, I don't get it.

301
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,750
Why do we keep
looking in those areas?

302
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,875
Every single one
of the Virus Cores

303
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,416
that have been found
so far were discovered

304
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,250
in and around
the 6 Lost Grounds.

305
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,458
Even the one you have?

306
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,000
Yes.

307
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,333
But at a time like this,

308
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,333
do you really think
going there is a wise move?

309
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,916
We don't know how long all
of this is going to last.

310
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,833
Do you really plan on
waiting until TaN gives up?

311
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,541
I guess not.

312
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,791
The purpose of the Twilight
Brigade is the pursuit

313
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,000
of the Key of the Twilight
that may or may not exist.

314
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:54,916
Right.

315
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,750
So...

316
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,250
What do we do?

317
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,458
Sakisaka, Tabby and Haseo...

318
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,916
Good luck.

319
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,333
What about you?

320
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,375
The three of you will
make up the whole team today.

321
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,041
I'll be waiting here so I
don't miss Ovan's communication.

322
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,125
Well, shall we go?

323
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,666
Okay.

324
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:27,041
How should we search for them?

325
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,333
Remember, it's an item
that is not listed in the specs.

326
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,666
Hey, I wonder...

327
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,500
...is Shino on a date
with her boyfriend?

328
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,666
Her boyfriend?

329
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,333
Of course she isn't.

330
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,666
Besides she denied it.

331
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,000
Stop jumping to
so many conclusions.

332
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,625
Okay.

333
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,250
Is that a problem?

334
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,291
Of course not.

335
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,208
It's none of my business.

336
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,125
Are you jealous?

337
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,833
Why would I be?

338
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,791
Well, you always
avoid looking at her.

339
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,666
Yeah, so?

340
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,041
A man avoids the gaze
of the woman he adores.

341
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:06,208
There's no treasure box!

342
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,458
No monsters!

343
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:10,333
How are we supposed
to find anything here?!

344
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,500
Maybe we'll come
across one on the ground?

345
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,000
You know what?

346
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,708
It's not gonna be that easy
to find any of these things!

347
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,416
What is this?

348
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,666
Is it some kind of pattern?

349
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,708
No, there are no
patterns like this in the game.

350
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:40,541
Gee, I wonder what it is?

351
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:45,375
I see.

352
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,000
That's why it's
necessary for you

353
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:50,916
to find the Key of
the Twilight before Ovan does.

354
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,833
Just leave it to me.

355
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,916
Here's my report.

356
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,458
The Brigade members look calm

357
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,083
but under the surface
they're anxious.

358
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm certain after
the scare I gave them

359
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,125
they're panicking right now

360
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,041
and they're eager to
find another item.

361
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,666
Haseo is most likely
checking out the information

362
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,375
that I gave him.

363
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,041
I guarantee he'll bite.

364
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,583
Tawaraya, would you excuse us.

365
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,000
But why?

366
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:16,416
Sometimes it's better if you
don't know everything.

367
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,833
Alright.

368
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,958
So, we'll be moving along soon.

369
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,541
Are you getting rid of him?

370
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,916
How are the preparations going?

371
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Good.

372
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,916
But what if Ovan
decides not to come?

373
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,250
What then?

374
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,625
If we use the Key of the
Twilight as bait he will.

375
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:41,125
And the trap is set.

376
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,166
But with this trap
we'll only catch one.

377
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,166
That's not a problem.

378
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,000
And after, what about Tawaraya?

379
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,666
Just leave him alone.

380
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,000
I understand.

381
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,708
I'll keep a watch
on the Brigade.

382
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,458
This area is really big.

383
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,041
I think they should be
around here somewhere.

384
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,958
What's wrong?

385
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,583
Huh?

386
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,833
This is a weird
place, isn't it?

387
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:37,625
I have no idea why it's here.

388
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:38,708
Don't you agree?

389
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,000
Yeah.

390
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,166
No, you don't.

391
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,833
What?

392
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,208
You're hiding something,
aren't you Haseo?

393
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,541
Huh?

394
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,708
You're dead if you even
think of betraying us.

395
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:54,750
Over here! Over here!

396
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,333
What is this thing?

397
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,166
This isn't a coincidence.

398
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,750
It's not that simple.

399
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,625
Besides, there's
more Lost Grounds.

400
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,333
That's true, but still...

401
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,833
You know what?

402
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,666
Alright. Let's get outta here.

403
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,750
We gotta get to the next
place and keep looking.

404
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,583
Quit wasting time!

405
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,291
O-Oh, okay!

406
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:48,958
Hey!

407
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,041
What?

408
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,708
Meow.
