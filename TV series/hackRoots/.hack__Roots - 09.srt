1
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,250
[SAKISAKA]
Hold on a second.

2
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,416
--Huh?
--Huh?

3
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
What the heck
are we doing here?

4
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,666
We haven't even found
all the Virus Cores yet.

5
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,750
[OVAN] The remaining
two will move our way

6
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,125
because we are here.

7
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,791
Yeah, I suppose...

8
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,416
But we'll be screwed
if TaN surrounds us

9
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,791
in a place like this.

10
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,458
What are we gonna do then?

11
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:24,625
We'll be fine as long
as we stick together.

12
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:25,958
Have faith.

13
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,666
Aren't you coming, Teacher?

14
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,708
I... know what's gonna happen.

15
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,291
Huh?

16
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,625
[TABBY]
Hey, wait!

17
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,916
[BSET]
I won't let you go!

18
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,250
[GORD] It has nothing
to do with you!

19
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,166
[BSET]
Of course it does!

20
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,250
[GORD] Why? You quit
when I did, remember?

21
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:54,750
[BSET]
That's not it.

22
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,375
[GORD] You know what
my objective is, right?

23
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,916
This is my only chance.

24
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,333
If I want to defeat him,
I have to act now.

25
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,333
The information is
leading me this way.

26
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,500
I understand that.

27
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't think you do!

28
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,541
He wasted our time on
something that doesn't exist!

29
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,125
You remember, don't you, Bset?

30
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,083
You quit as well.

31
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,083
[BSET]
Yeah.

32
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,833
All that aimless searching.

33
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,083
It must have been
especially upsetting for you.

34
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,208
Yeah, but...

35
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,083
...no one forced me.

36
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,500
I followed him out
of my own free will.

37
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,000
How very gracious of you.

38
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,666
But me,

39
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,541
I won't ever forgive him.

40
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,333
I think you're wrong, Gord.

41
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,208
What are you talking about?

42
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,250
You know what?

43
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,750
I really don't care
if I'm wrong.

44
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,750
He's gonna pay for all
the times he tricked us

45
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,291
into working like dogs.

46
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,833
Ovan's gonna regret
ever meeting me.

47
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,875
And this will be
the end of him.

48
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,541
[NAOBI]
Is everything ready?

49
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,083
[ENDER]
Nothing's been overlooked.

50
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:30,166
[NAOBI] Ender, you know
what your job is, I assume?

51
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,375
I chase him into
the highest floor.

52
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,750
He finds himself trapped.

53
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,291
Then he's ours.

54
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,083
[NAOBI]
Exactly.

55
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:41,583
I won't tolerate failure.

56
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,458
There's evidence

57
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,500
of someone
secretly investigating

58
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,625
our illegal activities.

59
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,166
Who could it be?

60
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,500
The Administrator?

61
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,083
[NAOBI]
No.

62
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,500
Who else, then?

63
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,791
[NAOBI] Don't let it
be a concern to us.

64
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:15,583
It's about time for us
to leave this place, anyway.

65
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,000
And also...

66
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:26,875
Ovan isn't the type to be
lured out like this very often.

67
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,958
We only have this one chance.

68
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,833
I understand completely.

69
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,208
Hey, Ovan?

70
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,208
Uh, Ovan, I'm
going to go, uh...

71
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,750
...get the other Virus Core.

72
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,916
--Huh?
--Huh?

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,333
Are you?

74
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,416
How do you know the whereabouts
of another Virus Core?

75
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,750
[SAKISAKA]
Well, I, uh...

76
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,416
I'm certain that Tawaraya
from TaN has one.

77
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,000
Tawaraya has one?

78
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,666
You guys know each other?

79
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,083
[OVAN] The most important
thing right now

80
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,375
is that we get
the Virus Cores.

81
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,666
[SAKISAKA]
Well, I'll go get it then.

82
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,083
But Ovan...

83
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,125
Do you want me
to come with you?

84
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,916
Do you think you
have the courage?

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,208
It seems kinda scary,

86
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,083
but if I'm with
Teacher, I'll be fine!

87
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,250
[SAKISAKA]
Don't bother.

88
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,791
The game should be
enjoyed, right?

89
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,875
Huh?

90
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:46,375
That leaves one more.

91
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,958
Our friend Gord.

92
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,458
He'll be here soon.

93
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,750
[PC 9A] He's not
here today, either?

94
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,666
[PC 9B] Is he really
gonna trap the Brigade?

95
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,833
[PC 9A]
As if.

96
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,291
[PC 9B]
Yeah, really.

97
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,625
I wonder what
they're up to.

98
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,291
What the...?

99
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,250
Start by eliminating
the weakest.

100
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,791
After that,

101
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,458
wait for my command.

102
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,833
[ENDER] The tastiest part
should always be left for last.

103
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,333
We're not running, are we?

104
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,875
I can take 'em!

105
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,416
For the sake of our goal,

106
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,250
I don't intend to leave now.

107
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,250
Huh?

108
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,416
Ovan, you're sure?

109
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,041
I'm goin' for it!

110
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,416
Just keep them at bay.

111
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,458
Hopefully we won't have
to fight them long.

112
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,333
We just need time to get
the other Virus Cores.

113
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,083
Battling monsters
is acceptable,

114
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,708
but it is not the way
to gain true strength.

115
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,125
The only way
to gain true strength

116
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:32,041
is by fighting unpredictable
player characters.

117
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,625
Isn't that right?

118
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,458
Become stronger, Haseo.

119
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,916
The time is now.

120
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,750
What about you?

121
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,083
You don't need
to worry, Tabby.

122
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,458
I'll be all right.

123
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,625
[TABBY]
But you're a Harvest Cleric.

124
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:49,166
It's okay, I'm still
able to fight. 

125
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,500
[HASEO]
Here they come!

126
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,250
[BSET]
I wonder...

127
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,125
...what's happening with them.

128
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,666
Are you really
that concerned?

129
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,708
[BSET] And don't say it
doesn't have anything

130
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,916
to do with me.

131
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,791
I still haven't come
to terms with everything.

132
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,333
[PHYLLO]
I see.

133
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,291
Ovan's dream

134
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:15,541
is to get a hold of
the Key of the Twilight.

135
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,625
Sometimes I wonder if he will.

136
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,083
Ovan isn't the type of man

137
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,500
you need to
worry about, is he?

138
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,458
[BSET]
I guess not.

139
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,750
[PC 9C] I heard the Brigade
finally made a move.

140
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,583
Wanna go watch?

141
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,916
[PC 9D]
No way!

142
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,833
A group of Player Killers
just headed that way.

143
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:34,333
I don't wanna get
caught up in that.

144
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,708
It sounds like the competition
for the Key of the Twilight

145
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,250
seems to be finally underway.

146
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,333
Well...

147
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:46,666
[PHYLLO] If you're that
concerned, you should go.

148
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,416
I can't...

149
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,250
Sometimes it's better to forget
about what's holding you back...

150
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,583
...and let your
actions speak for you.

151
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,750
Go on! Get moving
before it's too late.

152
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,625
If you don't, you'll
undoubtedly regret it.

153
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,250
You're gonna have
to give that up!

154
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,750
It was mine in
the first place.

155
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,416
Why don't you go get your own?

156
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,416
But it's completely
useless to you.

157
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,666
Even so, it's still
valuable merchandise.

158
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,416
Hey, Tawaraya,

159
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,000
wanna know why I came
here all by myself?

160
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,708
To steal the Core
back from you!

161
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,791
I'm not leaving
here empty handed!

162
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,916
Whoa, whoa, you're a
little worked up!

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,333

The reason's simple.

is right in front of him,

You should be less
concerned about their demise
