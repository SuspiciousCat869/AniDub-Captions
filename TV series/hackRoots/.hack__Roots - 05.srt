1
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,458
[OVAN] So this
is the last one.

2
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,000
[SHINO] It's okay,
you're safe now.

3
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,041
[TABBY] Why did
that Player Killer

4
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,916
do such a horrible thing?

5
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,125
I know...

6
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,625
[SAKISAKA] Hey, what
did this guy look like?

7
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,416
I'm not sure...

8
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,625
Did you see him?

9
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,166
I don't remember
it that well...

10
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,500
But, it wasn't a guy...

11
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,000
...it was a woman.

12
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,208
She was really strong
and I had no chance.

13
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,583
I just heard a rumor
that Gord got PKed.

14
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,791
It couldn't be
the same person, could it?

15
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,375
What are you
thinking, Sakisaka?

16
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,291
I don't think
Tabby was randomly PKed

17
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,541
and I suspect that our
Brigade is being targeted.

18
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,250
But, Gord isn't a
member anymore.

19
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,916
And besides, why would
anybody target the Brigade?

20
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,208
That's what
I'd like to know.

21
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,500
Did she say anything?

22
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,750
She asked me
about our guild.

23
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,083
And?

24
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,625
I told her I just joined
and didn't know anything.

25
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,708
[HASEO] Stop mumbling
just 'cause you got PKed.

26
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,291
Well, what
about you, huh?

27
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,375
Excuse me?

28
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,125
Arguing is forbidden here.

29
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,208
But Shino, since
this guy joined...

30
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,875
Nothing must be
done out of revenge.

31
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,000
But...

32
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,916
This is a time
for patience.

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,458
It makes me angry.

34
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,750
But I don't like
PKing or getting PKed,

35
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,291
so I agree with Shino!

36
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,083
It's just a game,
so it's gotta be fun!

37
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:55,166
Well, what can I do?

38
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,250
[BSET] I wonder what
the Twilight Brigade

39
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,833
is doing right now.

40
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,833
[PHYLLO] If you really care
you should join them again.

41
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:10,458
My interest doesn't
go as far as caring.

42
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,750
When she came after me

43
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,291
I told her
I didn't know anything.

44
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,583
I hate to admit it,

45
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,708
but I sincerely
don't know anything.

46
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,916
It really has
nothing to do with us.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,208
As long as
you're not planning

48
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,916
to have anything to
do with the Brigade.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,083
It's not that easy

50
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,791
to try and make
a clean break.

51
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,250
It's about the job you
gave me the other day.

52
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,166
[TAWARAYA] You need
to be more specific.

53
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,708
Umm, you wanted me

54
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,750
to check out a
certain Player Character.

55
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,375
Is there a problem?

56
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,875
You getting complaints?

57
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,500
No, but in addition
to compensation I

58
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,458
was given something strange,

59
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,458
and I'm not sure
what to do with it.

60
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,083
There's nothing wrong
with accepting a tip.

61
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,208
But, it's an item
I've never seen before.

62
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,916
Where's the guy
who gave you that?

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,083
He took off.

64
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:11,208
Find out where he is
and contact him immediately.

65
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,250
I'll take care of this.

66
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,333
Okay.

67
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,791
Haseo, wait a second!

68
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,583
It's too dangerous
to be out alone!

69
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:31,125
Listen, Tabby,
I'm not like you.

70
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:35,500
Anyway, stop
following me, will ya?

71
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,541
It's strange for this
to be happening now.

72
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,875
Yes.

73
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,125
Why has a new Lost Ground
suddenly appeared?

74
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,625
And why is it here?

75
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,958
There was a dragon sleeping
at the bottom of this lake.

76
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,083
I heard that to gain
strength it was eating

77
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,125
any monsters and travelers
who looked into the water.

78
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,666
And one day,
it revealed itself.

79
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,500
Yes.

80
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,250
That's the kind
of place this is.

81
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,250
It would be nice if things
would go smoothly from now on.

82
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,250
They will.

83
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:25,375
They're not
the types to withdraw

84
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,083
just because
someone was PKed.

85
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,208
I know.

86
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,208
Why don't you
talk to them?

87
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,166
Because that's your job.

88
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,083
I'll leave it to you.

89
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,666
I see...

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,375
Do you know what that is?

91
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,500
[NAOBI] Yes.

92
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:53,875
It's an anachronism.

93
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,583
An anachronism?

94
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:01,083
There were lots of them
in the old game.

95
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,750
Where did you get it?

96
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,083
I can't say.

97
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,541
It seems your anachronism

98
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,416
was being passed
around by many players.

99
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,250
Interesting.

100
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,416
Nobody knew
what to do with it.

101
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,583
If you want to disturb
the Brigade, use this.

102
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,416
And depending
on how you use it,

103
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,875
some interesting
things could happen.

104
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,666
Is that so?

105
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,083
[ENDER] Hold on a sec!

106
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,708
If it's work involving
the Brigade I'll do it.

107
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,500
Concerning the use
of this item,

108
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,750
it's better if you
leave it to Tawaraya.

109
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,833
Well, then. I'll be going.

110
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,583
You're always here.

111
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,416
I had a feeling you'd come.

112
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,375
I wanna talk to Gord.

113
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,708
Where is he?

114
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,208
Is this your friend?

115
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,375
My name is Tabby and I'm a
member of the Twilight Brigade.

116
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,041
Pleased to meet ya.

117
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,041
You can call me
Phyllo, young lady.

118
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,500
You've been through
a lot, haven't you?

119
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,541
Tell me where Gord is.

120
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,500
My guess is he's probably
somewhere in this town.

121
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:14,458
Did you see him?

122
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,250
No, he's with Bset.

123
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:20,791
I heard that someone
was chasing her as well.

124
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,291
Really, Bset?

125
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,333
Yes, I think she and Gord
are still in the alchemy area.

126
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,583
You'll always find
Bset there, guaranteed.

127
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,541
You've been there,
haven't you?

128
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:36,708
So, I'm your second
choice after Haseo?

129
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,500
We have different
plans for you.

130
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,083
In business, you have to look

131
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,166
into any opportunity
that could be profitable.

132
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:49,000
Profitable?

133
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,250
We've decided that
you might be useful.

134
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:51,916
That doesn't sound
like a compliment.

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,458
Here, think fast!

136
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,750
Ovan has his eye on that.

137
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,166
He wants this?

138
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,416
To be honest, I have
no idea what it is...

139
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,833
...or what he's planning
to do with it.

140
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:11,375
However...

141
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:15,708
So what's the big deal?

142
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,791
This item is not
in the game specs.

143
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,250
Not in the specs?

144
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:25,041
Key of the Twilight?

145
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,375
You never know,

146
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,958
it could possibly have
something to do with that.

147
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:33,041
So ask Ovan about it.

148
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,791
He is your guild master, right?

149
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,625
You really
don't know anything?

150
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,083
Now, that's a problem.

151
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:49,250
You see,
if he doesn't

152
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,666
pass along information
to his members,

153
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,000
it means he doesn't
trust you guys.

154
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,375
Or possibly,
he's just using the guild

155
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,666
and is going to take
whatever you find for himself.

156
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,041
Impossible.

157
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:03,416
Quit then...

158
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,041
...to come work with me.

159
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,375
I think I'll
hang on to this.

160
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:22,458
Thanks, come again.

161
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,250
Hey.

162
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:41,916
Where's Gord?

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,083
He's not around right now.

164
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,583
Logged out?

165
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,166
No.

166
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,916
But you should leave him
alone for a little while.

167
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,708
Gord has been flaunting around
his plans to defeat Ovan.

168
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,416
You know that,
don't you?

169
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,750
He was just PKed
by some unknown player

170
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,083
and I'm guessing he's
still a little bit freaked out.

171
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,708
He wants to defeat Ovan?

172
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,291
Do you feel that way too?

173
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,583
Of course I don't.

174
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,583
Are you a newbie?

175
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,166
My name's Tabby!

176
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,666
Who are you?

177
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,833
Are you targeting Ovan too?

178
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,458
No. I'm not.

179
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,333
So, what is this about?

180
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,375
Did you get PKed?

181
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:25,041
No.

182
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,000
Because I was in town,
I was only chased.

183
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,083
Well, do you happen
to know who it was?

184
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,625
What're you gonna do?

185
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,291
At your current level
you'll be quickly defeated.

186
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,500
But I...

187
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,375
Ender.

188
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,916
Ender?

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,416
You know her?

190
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,791
[HASEO] Well no,
but why is TaN...

191
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,375
TaN?

192
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:48,041
Wait! Haseo!

193
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,791
You know Ender,
don't you?

194
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,916
You do, right?

195
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,250
I don't know her!

196
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,041
But, just a minute ago...

197
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,000
Hey, just stop following me.

198
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:05,083
It's too dangerous
on your own.

199
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,250
Well, Sakisaka's
by himself.

200
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,750
No, you don't understand.

201
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,916
Sakisaka will be fine.

202
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,083
Huh?

203
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,666
Because he's my teacher.

204
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,583
He can't lose!

205
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,708
You're getting
on my nerves.

206
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,291
Who's this?

207
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,916
What are you doing here?

208
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,416
What do you mean?

209
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,000
I was following Haseo.

210
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,208
So where exactly
have you been?

211
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,416
Umm...

212
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,916
I was just...

213
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,416
I'm going back home.

214
00:12:47,500 --> 00:13:00,875
Hey, that guy who just
came by TaN's home area...

215
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,791
wasn't that Haseo?

216
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,666
He's already switched guilds?

217
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,000
Well the Twilight Brigade
is nothing compared to TaN.

218
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:11,125
What did he say?

219
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,458
Why did you call me here?

220
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,666
I would like to hear
your opinion on something.

221
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,875
My opinion?

222
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,333
There's an item that doesn't
exist in the game specs.

223
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,541
Without it you can't
get to the place

224
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,708
where the Key of
the Twilight is.

225
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,333
An item that's not in the specs?

226
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,541
Whaddaya say about that?

227
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,791
Interested?

228
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,708
So?

229
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:37,666
So what?

230
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,375
So what if
I have no opinion?

231
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,208
Do you think
it could be true?

232
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,125
Who knows?

233
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,000
Aren't you a member
of the Twilight Brigade?

234
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,416
The Isn't the Key
of the Twilight

235
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,666
what you're hunting for--

236
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,791
I don't care what
info you have to offer...

237
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,125
this has nothing
to do with you.

238
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:03,625
Oh, it certainly does,
you just don't see it.

239
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:11,250
Tawaraya leaked
the information directly.

240
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:17,250
Ender, you know
what to do next, right?

241
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,416
Yes.

242
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Go for the weakest link.

243
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,583
Done.

244
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,375
Who exactly... are you?

245
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,750
What's this?

246
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,958
Are you
interested in me now?

247
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,416
Well why wouldn't I?

248
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,916
You're the one sniffing
around the Brigade

249
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,750
and PKing everyone,
aren't you?

250
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:46,875
So, what?

251
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,333
But why?

252
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,125
I've got the same agenda
as you and your friends:

253
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,250
finding the
Key of the Twilight.

254
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,083
Hey, there's Haseo!

255
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,875
Good luck to ya,
little boy.

256
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,666
Haseo!

257
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,291
Haseo!

258
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,208
Oh! What happened?

259
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,000
You look really grim!

260
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,333
Is something the matter?

261
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,041
Please leave me alone.

262
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,166
And here I was I was
worried about you.

263
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,666
Sissy!

264
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,166
Stupid PKer.

265
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,125
[NASUBI] It's very rare
to see you in town.

266
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,083
Shut up!

267
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,333
If you have time
to talk to me,

268
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,041
you have time to look
for some information!

269
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,500
Idiot...

270
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,666
Is that...?

271
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:15,791
Haseo, what do you think
about your information

272
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,416
on the item that's
not in the specs?

273
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,958
I think...

274
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,666
we all need to take a closer
look at this item either way.

275
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,333
We should try to find out

276
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,541
if it has anything to do with
the Key of the Twilight.

277
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,833
Well then, investigate it.

278
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:34,916
If your information is correct,
then you take credit for it.

279
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,875
Haseo smiled!

280
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,791
No, I didn't.

281
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:48,333
Now, there's something
I want you all to do.

282
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,250
What is it? What is it?

283
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,000
There's an item
called a "Virus Core"

284
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,583
that's not in the manual.

285
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:54,875
I want you to search for it.

286
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,500
Virus Core?!

287
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,541
Do you know about it?

288
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,750
No.

289
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,375
Shino, show
them where to go.

290
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,500
Okay.

291
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,333
We need a Virus Core.

292
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,958
It's a special item
found only in a Lost Ground.

293
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,458
So, you mean it's a rare item?

294
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,083
Exactly.

295
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,083
Let's spread out
and look for it.

296
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,333
Well, how many
of them are there?

297
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,166
I'm not sure how many,

298
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,208
but I think
there's more than one.

299
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,791
What does it look like?

300
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,541
I believe it's
shaped like this.

301
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,875
It's really small.

302
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,500
I wonder if
we'll find them.

303
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,750
You'll never know
what's to be discovered

304
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,583
if you give up even
before you start looking.

305
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,083
That's right!

306
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,083
And I'm gonna be
the first one to find it!

307
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,041
Do you really think
we should separate?

308
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:54,583
After all, we are
being targeted, you know.

309
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,583
Sakisaka,
you worry too much.

310
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,916
Whatever.

311
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,666
Then I guess
I'll go have a look.

312
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,708
It's beautiful, isn't it?

313
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:26,458
Yeah but,
I really don't think

314
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,875
we're gonna find that
item in a place like this.

315
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,541
No matter what
information there may be,

316
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,375
the Twilight Brigade
always tries.

317
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:37,208
You wanted to check out the
information, too, didn't you?

318
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:48,750
What is that?

319
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,541
I don't know what that is.

320
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,250
But that's okay.

321
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:57,250
Things we don't understand
surround us constantly.

322
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,583
It's true, and not
just in the game world.

323
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,791
It's the same in the real world,

324
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:06,750
at home or in school,
or at your part-time job.

325
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:07,791
Because of the unknown,

326
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,208
there's the joy
of understanding.

327
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,541
And because
of the mysterious,

328
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,875
there's the excitement
of discovery.

329
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,500
Even if you don't
always know the rules,

330
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,291
just enjoy your role
and take things as they come,

331
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,791
and everything
will fall into place.

332
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,083
There would be
nothing left to enjoy...

333
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,375
...if we knew everything.

334
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:42,958
Tabby!

335
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:49,916
The woman who PKed me!

336
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,250
Hei.

337
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,541
Our running speed
should have increased!

338
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,125
So, hurry!

339
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,541
It doesn't matter
how fast you run...

340
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,250
...or how far you go.

341
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:12,250
You're all trapped like mice.

342
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,291
It's so quiet.

343
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,750
Where did she come from?

344
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,958
She showed up as if
she was waiting for us.

345
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,583
Haseo, did you do something?

346
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,833
Me? Why would I?

347
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,083
Well, I've been
hearing rumors.

348
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,291
People are saying
that you switched to TaN.

349
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,375
Tabby!

350
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,250
What?

351
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,041
Something isn't right!

352
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,916
Well, where did you get the
information you gave to Ovan?

353
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,791
What's all this "defeat Ovan"
stuff you've been talking about?

354
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,291
Fine, whatever.

355
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,666
Haseo.

356
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,208
No one's gonna complain
if I quit this guild, right?

357
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,500
Tabby, that was way too much.

358
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,166
Goodness me.

359
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,000
Oh, this isn't like you.

360
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,583
Are you feeling down?

361
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:50,583
Hey, Haseo?

362
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,750
Would you buzz off?

363
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,791
If you need anything else,
don't hesitate to call me.

364
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,875
So it's true...
Haseo is...
