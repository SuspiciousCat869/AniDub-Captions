1
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,250
[HASEO] Looks like we
haven't sparked any rumors

2
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,750
even though we've disbanded.

3
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,416
[SHINO] It's probably
because people realized

4
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,291
it has nothing
to do with them,

5
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,083
and they've grown tired
of talking about us.

6
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,500
[HASEO]
I guess so.

7
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,750
And what about Ovan?

8
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:30,541
Have you heard
anything from him?

9
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:34,250
His cell phone isn't
even working anymore.

10
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,791
I see.

11
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,125
Can I...

12
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,791
...ask you something?

13
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,083
What is it?

14
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,750
[HASEO]
Your... Your cell phone number.

15
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:56,916
I'm afraid you
might disappear, too.

16
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,916
Don't worry, I won't leave!

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,125
Maybe I am worrying too much.

18
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,416
Got something to write on?

19
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,958
[HASEO]
Uh... uh, yeah.

20
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,125
[SHINO] Here,
I'll give you my number.

21
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,916
If something happens--

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,125
No, even if nothing
happens, you can call me.

23
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,833
[HASEO]
Okay.

24
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,458
I'll give you mine, too.

25
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,750
Wanna do something?

26
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:31,750
Practice Rengeki--

27
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,208
Not that again.

28
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,166
Yeah, you're right.

29
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,625
You know what?

30
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,541
It doesn't feel like
the Brigade's disbanded.

31
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,625
Huh?

32
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,291
I feel like we
could go to our @HOME

33
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,458
and Shino would
be there just like before.

34
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,958
Hey, listen...

35
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,291
What is it?

36
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,416
The Brigade's gone,
and so is our headquarters.

37
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,166
We don't have
an @HOME anymore.

38
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,750
I guess so.

39
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,958
She's probably hangin' around
in a field or in town...

40
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,458
waiting somewhere
for Ovan to show up.

41
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,875
Y'know, when the
Twilight Brigade was together...

42
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:11,375
Every single day
was so much fun.

43
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,708
I have an idea!

44
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,166
Teacher, why don't
we just make our own?

45
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,250
Own what?

46
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,416
Our own guild!

47
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,833
Seriously?

48
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,625
Come on! Let's go!

49
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,666
Let's go apply
for our own guild.

50
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,583
Wha...

51
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,666
Well then...

52
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,291
What do you think
we should call it?

53
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,625
I see you're alone again today.

54
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,708
Shino was with me
just a minute ago,

55
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,875
but she had to log out

56
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,833
'cause she's got
a paper to do for school.

57
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,291
Duty calls.

58
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,583
Don't you have one of
those to do yourself?

59
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,791
Whaddaya mean?

60
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,083
A term paper.

61
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,083
Yeah, but I don't
feel like doing it.

62
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,625
It has nothing
to do with how you feel.

63
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,666
Sometimes you have to do
what you have to do.

64
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,083
I just won't feel comfortable
until Ovan gets back.

65
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,333
Just because Shino logged out

66
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,125
doesn't mean I feel
okay doing the same.

67
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,166
I don't know.

68
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,500
What exactly was that thing
we were searching for, anyway?

69
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:17,416
[PHYLLO] You've asked
that same question before.

70
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,125
Yeah, I remember.

71
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,625
[PHYLLO]
I suppose it turns out

72
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:25,750
that the Key of the Twilight
isn't real after all.

73
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,416
--[HASEO] But...
--Huh?

74
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,166
Do you really think Ovan

75
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,833
would've wasted
his time like that?

76
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,791
I don't understand
what you mean.

77
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,208
Well, I have no doubt
he totally believed it existed.

78
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,000
Are you surprised
such an eccentric man

79
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,125
believed in something
that isn't real?

80
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,541
It's just not like Ovan.

81
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,958
Don't you think?

82
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,250
I suppose that could be true.

83
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:01,416
[PI] We still cannot
trace Ovan's whereabouts.

84
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,916
[YATA]
The search must continue.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,625
At the same time,
analysis of the data

86
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,625
we have so far
must be done quickly.

87
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,416
I understand completely.

88
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,583
Boy, Teacher sure is
taking a long time.

89
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,250
[PC 13A]
Hey!

90
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,583
[SAKISAKA]
How's it goin'?

91
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,500
[PC 13A] You're still
hangin' around here?

92
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,541
Everyone's already
switched, you know.

93
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,458
You should come
with the rest of us.

94
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,083
[SAKISAKA]
Yeah, so I've heard.

95
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,291
[PC 13A]
As long as you know.

96
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,458
Well I'm gonna get my stuff
ready and cancel my account.

97
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,833
[SAKISAKA]
Okay.

98
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,708
[PC 13A] I'll be waiting
for you over there.

99
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,708
Oh, just hang on a second!

100
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,125
[HASEO]
You like those?

101
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,083
[SHINO]
Mmm-hmm.

102
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,458
You had one...

103
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,833
...at the Twilight
Brigade's headquarters.

104
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,416
I don't have much room
for plants in my apartment,

105
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,041
so I thought I'd at least
like to have one in the game.

106
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,041
I asked Ovan if it was okay.

107
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,250
He said he liked them, too.

108
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,583
[HASEO]
I see.

109
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,458
My place is cramped.

110
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,458
I live by myself.

111
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,750
[HASEO]
Hmm?

112
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,166
I have so many bookshelves,

113
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,708
but not enough space
for other things.

114
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:48,416
Dracaena Massangeana.
The Tree of Happiness.

115
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,125
When I live in a bigger house,

116
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,750
that's the first thing
I'm going to buy.

117
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,291
Well, when that happens,

118
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,291
I'll buy you one as a present.

119
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:04,083
Sometimes you say
the same things as Ovan.

120
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,000
The same as Ovan... right.

121
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,416
[SHINO]
Let's go.

122
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,083
You're late and you're
also in a bad mood.

123
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,791
Did something happen?

124
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,916
I'm bored.

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,958
We made a guild and
there's still nothing to do.

126
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,583
[SAKISAKA]
Right.

127
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,916
[TABBY]
Oh! You wanna do something?

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,208
[SAKISAKA]
I think I'm gonna quit.

129
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,708
You're quitting?
Why all of a sudden?

130
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,041
I'm still sore about
what happened with the Brigade.

131
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,916
I-- This game isn't fun anymore.

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,250
You can't quit.

133
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:59,458
My friends in the real world,
they've invited me.

134
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,250
[SAKISAKA] Have you heard
of the game Riot Gun?

135
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,000
No.

136
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,500
That's, uh...
what I'll be playing.

137
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,583
You're gonna quit even
though we made a guild?

138
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,416
I'm sorry, Tabby.

139
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,083
I honestly thought
I could forget about

140
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,250
the Twilight Brigade.
But I don't think I can.

141
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,625
Don't go.

142
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:24,250
I know, why don't
you come with me?

143
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,083
I dunno...

144
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,750
Shino's still playing, so...

145
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:32,708
But of course.

146
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,458
[SAKISAKA]
Well... take care!

147
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,958
Do you remember this place?
You and I have been here before.

148
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,250
Yeah. I recognize it.

149
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,958
And remember,

150
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,666
you asked about Ovan,

151
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,083
and I told you that over
time we had become alike?

152
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,708
--Huh?
--When you wanted to know

153
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,125
what I was to Ovan.

154
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,375
When you said that
you'd become like him?

155
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,208
I was telling a lie.

156
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,916
[HASEO]
A lie?

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,458
The truth really is...

158
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,708
I admire him deeply.
Don't you think it's wonderful

159
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,083
that he's been able
to make a home for all of us?

160
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,791
You wanna know what?

161
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,958
I think I wanted to become
someone like that...

But Shino, you are.

00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:33,625
Even though I
disbanded the Brigade?

165
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:37,083
You gave me something--

166
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,791
A reason to stay.

167
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,333
What the heck just happened?

168
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,166
Is this what I think...?

169
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,875
[HASEO]
You know what this is?

170
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,458
Nothing to worry about.

[TABBY giggling]

172
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,833
Even in the game,
I'm all alone.

173
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,666
[PHYLLO] Worrying so
much won't do you any good.

174
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,458
[SHINO] Using clichés like that
won't do you any good, either.

175
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,083
[PHYLLO]
You're right.

176
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:38,958
[SHINO]
You're the one who always

177
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:42,291
picks on my choice of words.

178
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,083
[PHYLLO] So, you still
haven't heard from him?

179
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,833
[SHINO]
I think I will soon.

180
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,541
[PHYLLO]
Why is that?

181
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,125
[SHINO]
I just have a feeling.

182
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:56,208
[PHYLLO] It would be nice
if he'd come back.

183
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,375
If something should
ever happen to me,

184
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,916
please take care of Haseo.

185

Look out for him.

186
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,583
What are you trying
to tell me, Shino?

187
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,083
If you were to disappear,
he'd go nuts.

188
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,041
I can't even imagine.

189
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,291
He might even go
and kill himself.

190
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,666
Are you kidding?

191
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,583
I'm not entirely joking.

192
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,708
But there is some truth to that.

193
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,833
Don't you agree?

194
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,500
He's been really
helpful in so many ways.

195
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:26,791
I'm glad that Ovan asked him
to join the Twilight Brigade.

196
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,416
Seriously.

197
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,333
That's why I want you
to take care of him

198
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,916
if something
should happen to me.

199
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,583
Promise me that.

200
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,791
This isn't like you at all.

201
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,458
Maybe you're right.

202
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,250
[TABBY]
Wait a minute!

203
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,833
It's been a while.

204
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,166
Yeah.

205
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,166
What do you want?

206
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,041
Do you have a second to talk?

207
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,416
Well, there's
nothing you can do.

208
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,916
You can't stop someone,

209
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,083
especially if they
really wanna leave.

210

I know that, but...

211
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,125
So, what are you going
to do without Sakisaka?

212
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,416
I'll probably stick around,

213
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,208
for a little while,
just hanging out.

214

Stick around
for a little while?

What do you mean?

216
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,500
I'll see how it goes,

217
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,000
then I'll probably quit.

218
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,458
I'm not gonna stop you.

219
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,875
Well, I didn't ask you to...

220
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,958
I don't expect you to begin
to understand what I'm feeling.

221
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,125
What if Shino were
to try to stop you?

222
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,541
Would you stay then?

223
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,708
Probably.

224
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,958
But...

225
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,958
...Shino hasn't been in
touch with me at all.

Well, I'm going now.

Where to?
