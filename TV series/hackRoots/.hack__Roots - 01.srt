You'd better be careful.

Right now, there are

Yes, Player Killers.

kill other players.

You worked very

There's no
need to thank me.

But without your help

I'd be completely
and hopelessly lost!

There's a map

on the upper left of
the screen, isn't there?

Yeah!

Like I told you before,

you won't get
lost if you use it.

But maps
confuse me.

You'll get it.

But, until I do,
it'll be difficult.

just stand by and watch.

the game today.

He revived him
after being PKed.

Then he disappeared.

about this beginner.

00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:04,916
How lame.

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,458
He sure picked
a weak vocation.

147
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,583
And black?

to remain concealed.

my ear to the ground!

worth a shot.

Yeah! Let's
follow him.

They're underestimating us.

That's no good.

Today's youth seem to

Huh?

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,708
Ovan left you
behind, did he?

Sorry.

They like to nose
into my gaming.

invite me to a chat.

If we talk in a chat,

able to eavesdrop.

Why what?

00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,250
Why did I start
talking to you?

Or maybe why
do I know Ovan?

Which one did
you want to ask?

I wanna know
about Ovan.

you had met him.

A mysterious...

the word subtle.

Tell me.

Do you know
what the difference

between mysterious
and eccentric is?

Is Ovan...
eccentric?

else is eccentric?

He even made his own
guild, which, of course,

223

means there are other
players working with him.

yet you refuse.

ashamed of your ignorance,

town he's been following you.

must be a reason.

he must have some
eccentric reason.

I was being followed?

to why Mr. Eccentricity

to play this game

pawns the newbies off on us,

Come on Sakisaka,

don't forget you were
a newbie at one time too.

If the old guys
were still around,

to be a baby sitter.

left our guild.

this stupid guild anyway?

Do you regret it?

I'm still around.

Humph. Listen, I have
a very short temper,

309

so you better just
answer the question.

310
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,916
There's no connection.

killed me, that's all.

When did you
start this game?

was my first time.

You're honest.
That's good.

So, what was it
that made you

wanna start playing
this game anyway?

318
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,583
Well, basically because
my friend said The World game

319
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,208
was interesting and
I thought I'd give it a try.

320
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,458
"Was?" Past tense?

321
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:42,333
Maybe your friend was playing
the old version of The World.

322
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,333
The one that existed
prior to this one...

323

So?

324
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,708
What do you mean, "so"?

325
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,291
So, what do you
think the chances are

326
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,750
that your friend or,
for that matter, you,

327
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,500
know the real Ovan?

328
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,208
How should I know?

329
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,375
Now think
about it carefully.

330
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,666
You said you
got PKed correct?

331
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,375
I wonder why?

332
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,541
No reason.

333
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,250
I think those guys
just went around

334
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,666
PKing people to
get their kicks.

335
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,458
Tell me Haseo,
how did they do it?

336
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,250
P... K.

337
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,291
Was it like this?

338
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,958
Not gonna beg?

339
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,833
You can run away now.

340
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,666
This is lame.

341
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,916
What could Ovan possibly
want with a loser like you?

342
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,666
You're not even worth
the effort of PKing.

343
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,583
See ya, little boy!

344
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,250
I can't believe this...

345
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,458
Why?

346
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,666
Why does this stuff
keep happening to me?

347
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,208
[GIRL A]
That was so easy!

348
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,958
[GIRL B] And those two
amateurs followed us.

349
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,666
And you know,
using female characters

350
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,208
really lures
those idiots in, doesn't it.

351
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,833
What should we
do with the loot?

352
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,291
Let's sell
it to TaN.

353
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,541
50-50, right?

354
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,083
Of course!

355
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,583
[GIRL B] This is why
I can't stop PKing.

356
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,291
[HASEO groans]

357
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,166
Wait a minute, I think
I saw that guy earlier.

358
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,125
You noticed him too?

359
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,458
[GIRLS laughing]

360
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,083
[OVAN] You have
to be stronger.

361
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,000
You have a gift.

362
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:16,000
Something completely unique,
that only you possess.

363
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,333
Let's meet
again soon Haseo.

364
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,583
Meet again?

365
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,458
But when exactly?

366
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,250
What is this gift?

367
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,083
And why was it given to me?

368
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,791
I shouldn't have
started playing this game.

369
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,583
I can't do this.

370
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,291
[footsteps]

371
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,458
Hello, cutie!

372
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,875
All by yourself now?

373
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,625
Wanna have some fun?

374
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,416
I'll give you a handicap.

375
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,125
[GIRL B laughing]

376
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,208
You just touched
him barehanded!

377
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,125
Oh! So brave!

378
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,541
But I don't think
you're strong enough

379
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,958
for what's
coming up next!

380
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,083
Goodnight, sweet prince!

381
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,666
Wonder how much longer
you're gonna last?

382
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,083
Why aren't
you killing him?

383
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,916
Weird... you
should be dead.

384
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:31,083
Hey, you're not posing
as a beginner, are you?

385
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,541
This little twerp?
Can't be.

386
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,250
He's just lucky.

387
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,583
Plain. Dumb. Luck.

388
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,916
You're way too weak to be
playing solo, little boy.

389
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,583
Yup.

390
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,333
[HASEO yelling and panting]

391
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,375
Chill out.

392
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,458
I said chill out.

393
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,666
[SHINO] Stop
what you're doing.

394
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,708
If you want to fight
with other players,

395
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,791
you should go
to the arena.

396
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,250
It's not what
you think, okay?

397
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,666
I know it's hard,
but don't quit.

398
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,083
I don't know you,

399
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,916
but I don't wanna
go on with this game...

400
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,625
it's so stupid,
and pointless.

401
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:03,708
It's not stupid.

402
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,333
And it's not pointless.

403
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,041
Because...
we need you.

404
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,791
Welcome, Haseo...
welcome to The World.

405
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:26,333
I have no absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.
