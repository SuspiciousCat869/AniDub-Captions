1
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,500
You can run away now!

2
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,791
Haseo.

3
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,583
Was that the player
who killed

4
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,750
over a hundred PKers
at one time?

5
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,333
You mean Haseo,
"The Terror of Death"?

6
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,458
The title's a bit much.

7
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,666
Anyway, we better
leave that psycho alone.

8
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,333
Master Yata!

9
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:41,750
It's Ovan... he's made a move.

10
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,416
So he's back.

11
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,833
Who is that?

12
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,291
Someone we're watching.

13
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,666
How long do you plan
to keep coming here?

14
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,833
Until you disclose
some insider info.

15
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,083
How's that?

16
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,291
I already told you,
I'm not an informant.

17
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,000
I was kidding.

18
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,916
I like hanging out
here just for the view.

19
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Well I find it irritating.

20
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,791
Tell me Phyllo,

21
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,208
why do you think Haseo
stopped coming here?

22
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,416
I'm sure he has his reasons.

23
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,583
Yeah.

24
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,083
I really don't know.

25
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,125
They're calling him
'The Terror of Death.'

26
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:52,750
Well, I guess he can't
turn back anymore, can he?

27
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:57,958
Of course he can...
if he chooses to.

28
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,708
He's got another chance if
he's willing to take it.

29
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,958
And that's not
just in the game...

30
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,916
but in the real world too.

31
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:14,083
Willing to take it... huh?

32
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,750
I doubt he'll cool off.

33
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,708
What do you think?

34
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,125
It's all because...

35
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,166
Shino became a Lost One...

36
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,333
Tell me something.

37
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,416
Are you still planning on
supporting Haseo like this?

38
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,416
I'm sorry, I...

39
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,458
I don't want a Papa like that!

40
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:06,416
I don't think I can continue
to help him either.

41
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,708
But!

42
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:12,750
But I think supporting Haseo...

43
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,291
Enough. Let's go!

44
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,833
I guess Haseo must
be the way he is...

45
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,708
because Shino became a Lost One.

46
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,625
That's why.

47
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,333
Meow?!

48
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,166
Well, it's been awhile.

49
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,083
Saburo!

50
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,458
I thought you'd be at this
so-called "historical area,"

51
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,666
so I stopped by.

52
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,916
I see.

53
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,416
What's the
matter with you?

54
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Well I...

55
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,625
There used to be
this dog that would

56
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,916
always be barking
on my way to school.

57
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,541
He was so annoying
but then he disappeared,

58
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,541
and instead of being relieved,
I really kinda missed.

59
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,250
You see as much
as it bothered me...

60
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,000
it was part of my day.

61
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,375
I guess...

62
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,875
it's kinda like that.

63
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:19,208
I'm not a dog... am I?

64
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,416
Well I guess you're a cat here.

65
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,250
You're so funny.

66
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,541
By the way, I heard
some rumors at Mac Anu.

67
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,833
But I'd take them all
with a grain of salt.

68
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,916
They're probably true--
all of them.

69
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,708
Maybe, but be reasonable.

70
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,041
What good is it if
you keep moping around?

71
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,750
I'm not moping.

72
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,416
It's just...

73
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,541
I know Haseo's actually
kind deep down inside.

74
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,583
That's why I can't decide
what to do about him.

75
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,750
Haseo is kind?

76
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,166
You're kidding, right?

77
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,416
Well...

78
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,583
You should know...

79
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,416
he often goes to
the Hulle Granz Cathedral.

80
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,083
I think he goes
there so he can pray.

81
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,125
Because it's a church?

82
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,875
It's not like that. I mean...

83
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,583
it's a special place for him.

84
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,583
You know, I should I should
be visiting it too.

85
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,083
So he goes there everyday?

86
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,083
I dunno.

87
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,250
But he ends up there every
time that he's logged in.

88
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,958
That's not like him.

89
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,208
He's thinking of
Shino all the time.

90
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,875
Don't you think that's kind?

91
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,416
He's such a sweetheart.

92
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,000
Shino?

93
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:29,916
Oh! Sorry.

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,708
You don't know her?

95
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:37,416
Haseo's like this...
because of Shino.

96
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,250
I really don't
know what happened,

97
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,000
But from what I can see,
he just wants to get stronger.

98
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,250
That's not true!

99
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:49,083
I know for sure that Haseo's
doing this to save Shino!

100
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,250
Okay, what about you?

101
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,333
Huh? M-Me?

102
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,750
Haseo's doing
something for Shino.

103
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:03,791
What are you doing then?

104
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,875
You're not doing anything, huh?

105
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,666
Wait!

106
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,708
Are you certain
you're okay with all this?

107
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,416
Have you ever considered
how Shino would react

108
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,625
to you being called
"The Terror of Death"?

109
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,583
Tri-Edge is not
the kind of opponent

110
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,041
you can defeat with
just your strength.

111
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,708
He's on an entirely
different level.

112
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,125
I can't stress enough

113
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,291
that this is not something
you can easily carry out.

114
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,625
No matter how
strong someone gets,

115
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,750
they're still no match
for Tri-Edge.

116
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,958
That's why Shino--

117
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,458
It doesn't matter
what Shino thinks!

118
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:08,041
Is that really what
you believe Haseo?

119
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm gonna go help Shino now!

120
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,375
I'll deal with
your criticism later!

121
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,875
Stop and listen to me!

122
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,750
We should just
do things on our own.

123
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,875
We'd still have a good time.

124
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:35,375
Like I said, she wasn't that
type of girl to begin with.

125
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,916
Just get over it.

126
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,541
Come on, it
isn't even like that.

127
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:44,166
Look, I supported you when you
wanted to make a guild...

128
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,458
one that helps beginners
and intermediates

129
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,083
find their way around
this game, remember?

130
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,583
That is true...

131
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,250
Yeah. But not her.

132
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,000
All she ever wanted to do was
help The Terror of Death!

133
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,916
Well, I'm determined to do it.

134
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,708
I'm not gonna end things half
way like this!

135
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:04,083
I guess you're right.

136
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,750
I can't do this alone.

137
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:09,541
Look, we have to work together
if you wanna be serious!

138
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,333
What's going on?

139
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,625
It's an argument between
the Moon Tree Guild's

140
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,416
Sakaki and Haseo,
The Terror of Death.

141
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,833
Wow, that's like
mixing water and oil!

142
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,916
Moon Tree hates
Player Killers, right?

143
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,125
Yeah!

144
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,583
Let's go check it out!

145
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,708
As usual, I'm useless.

146
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,791
Phyllo!

147
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,083
Phyllo!

148
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,083
Where'd you go?

149
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,791
Sorry, my cat and dog

150
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,083
were playing around
and pulled out the plug.

151
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,541
Never mind that Phyllo.

152
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,500
Haseo's over there!

153
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,083
You're saying you met him?

154
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,250
No, but...

155
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,291
I saw him fighting
someone in the plaza!

156
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,416
Almost time.

157
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,833
Ovan!

158
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,000
Hey!

159
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,458
Where do you think
you're going?

160
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,958
Oh Haseo...

161
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,416
Ovan!

162
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,750
It's been a long time, Haseo.

163
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:58,333
Or maybe I should call you
"The Terror of Death"?

164
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,625
You've gotten quite strong.

165
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:07,666
In fact much stronger
than before.

166
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,083
Well I was forced to
become stronger.

167
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,166
Thanks to you.

168
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,083
Haseo.

169
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,166
Always the reliable one.

170
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,750
I knew I could count on you.

171
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,416
When the Twilight
Brigade broke up,

172
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
why didn't you come back then?

173
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,750
Tell me.

174
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,208
What have you been doing
for the last six months?

175
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:30,500
Ovan, when you suddenly
disappeared, we all just...

176
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:34,083
How could you have
disappeared like that?

177
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:38,125
We were all waiting for you,
each one of us.

178
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,875
At the very least Shino and I
believed you were coming back.

179
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,416
The others began to doubt.

180
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:58,416
After that... Shino...

181
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,083
So I'm guessing
you want to know...

182
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,125
about Tri-Edge?

183
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,083
You saw Ovan?

184
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,291
That character...
it's really rare!

185
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,583
No one's seen him
for a long time.

186
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,916
Yeah, we saw him watching,
when Haseo was fighting.

187
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,083
Haseo was there?

188
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,750
He was, and as soon
as he spotted Ovan,

189
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,416
Haseo just took off after him.

190
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,583
Where'd he go?

191
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,166
I dunno...

192
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,750
But someone said they saw Ovan
at the Hulle Granz Cathedral.

193
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:39,708
When?

194
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,291
Just now, I think.

195
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,875
Apparently he was praying.

196
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:52,708
Look, He will be back today.

197
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:56,583
Can you guess where?

198
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,791
At the Hulle Granz Cathedral?!

199
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,958
Yes.

200
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,916
The place where
Shino was killed.

201
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,500
Tri-Edge is coming.

202
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,375
He's gonna be back.

203
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,791
Yes, finally...

204
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,500
I'll get my chance!

205
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:23,750
I swear I'm gonna be
able to bring Shino back!

206
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,250
Right Ovan?

207
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,291
Yes.

208
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,708
You and I.

209
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,416
We're the only ones who could
possibly bring her back.

210
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,083
We're the only ones.

211
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:37,375
Ovan?

212
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,291
I'll meet you
at the Holy Ground.

213
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,916
There are some
things I must do.

214
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,375
I have to know.

215
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,625
Is there anything I can do?

216
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
I wonder if he
really came here to pray?

217
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,583
Can I stay like this?

218
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,875
Just for a while?

219
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,291
Shino.

220
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,958
What is this?

221
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,625
What the...?
Master Yata!

222
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,208
There's an anomaly
occurring in the Cathedral!

223
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:25,041
You bastard! You're dead!

224
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:50,875
I failed...

225
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,666
I should've tried
to get his attention.

226
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,250
Well, if you're feeling regret

227
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,583
then maybe yes you
should have tried harder.

228
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,125
I wonder...

229
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,708
if Haseo has really become
The Terror of Death?

230
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,291
It doesn't matter.

231
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,291
You must now realize

232
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,416
that you're the only
one that can stop Haseo.

233
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,750
It's entirely up to you, Tabby.

234
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,416
Just me?

235
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,458
Really?

236
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,583
You can too, right?

237
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:21,416
Am I wrong?

238
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,375
My words don't get
through to him anymore.

239
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,833
It's the same with me.

240
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,250
He doesn't listen.

241
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,000
No, yours get through.

242
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,250
It's easy to tell that they do.

243
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,541
That's why he runs away
from you all of the time.

244
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,750
What is happening?

245
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,375
It seems that...

246
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,500
Haseo's battle with Tri-Edge...

247
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,583
has altered his data.

248
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,000
Has it been awakened?

249
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:08,625
No not yet.

250
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:10,875
What the...

251
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,500
Huh...?

252
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,833
It's been initialized?

253
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,916
Perhaps he's being data
drained...

254
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,541
What's happening?

255
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,583
This is-- 

256
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,500
You, shut up!

257
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,541
No.

258
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:54,791
I wasn't here.

259
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:55,375
Tell me...

260
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,875
What happened?

261
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,916
Haseo was...

262
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,333
It's true what they say about
getting really confused...

263
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,750
when so much seems to be
happening...

264
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,708
all at the same time.

265
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,750
Just stay calm.

266
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,625
What happened to Haseo?

267
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,500
He's been erased.

268
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:22,958
What?!
