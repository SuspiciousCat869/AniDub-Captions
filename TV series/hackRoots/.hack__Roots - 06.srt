1
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,666
[TABBY] Hey!

2
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,500
[PHYLLO] You're like
a sulky 12-year-old,

3
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,750
mad because he
didn't get his own way.

4
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,291
What are you
going to do next?

5
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,541
Steal a bike and
ride away with it?

6
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:13,916
If you don't like being
suspected then log out.

7
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,958
And if you still
don't like it, then quit.

8
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:21,166
After all, it's just a game.

9
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,458
Am I wrong?

10
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:32,166
Maybe we can't
trust Haseo anymore.

11
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,416
You think?

12
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,958
But at least I have
my teacher--Sakisaka!

13
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,000
Are you listening?

14
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,000
[SAKISAKA]
Huh? Uh... yeah.

15
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,250
You're acting strange.

16
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,666
What do you mean?

17
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,125
Are you going as well?

18
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:53,500
Uh, going where?

19
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,166
To see the meteor shower!

20
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,208
Huh?

21
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,958
It was on this morning's news.

22
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,291
It's something that only
happens every few decades.

23
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,125
And they said
there are gonna be

24
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,083
lots and lots
of shooting stars!

25
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,625
Huh?

26
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,166
You don't know about it?

27
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,291
Uh... no I don't.

28
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,958
I guess you're not
a teacher in the real world.

29
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,416
You should pay attention

30
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,125
to the Eastern sky tonight.

31
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:19,125
I live in a small
bachelor apartment.

32
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:22,750
I probably
won't see anything.

33
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,958
[SHINO] After I tell
the others about their mission,

34
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,541
I'll be taking a break
and logging out for today.

35
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,708
[OVAN] Alright.
I appreciate all your work.

36
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,125
The doctor at the hospital

37
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,416
says my recovery
is going smoothly.

38
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,833
But I'm afraid I still
have much more ahead of me.

39
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,166
Ah, I see.

40
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,041
I was thinking that
perhaps it would be best

41
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:58,250
if I give this mission
to Tabby and Sakisaka.

42
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,041
Haseo is
rather hard-headed,

43
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,916
and he can't cooperate
under these circumstances.

44
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,125
I'll leave it up to you.

45
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,041
Thank you Shino.

46
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:24,833
[TAWARAYA]
Alright.

47
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,541
[ENDER]
Working again?

48
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,958
My goodness, you never
take a break, do you?

49
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,500
For now, just
keep picking away

50
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,208
at the Twilight Brigade's
soft spots!

51
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,500
Well, see ya.

52
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:40,500
Picking away huh?

53
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,583
More like slashing!

54
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,541
If you think you've
been falsely accused,

55
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,750
you need to prove
your innocence on your own.

56
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,541
Otherwise...

57
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,250
You could log
out early today

58
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,208
and admire
the stars--and relax.

59
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,500
[HASEO]
Stars?

60
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,875
You haven't heard?

61
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,541
Tonight you can see
the meteor shower.

62
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,958
I'm not interested.

63
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,500
Okay, if I can
see the stars,

64
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,583
I'll contact you
and let you know, okay?

65
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,875
I don't care.

66
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,583
Anyway, I'll let you know.

67
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,875
Okay. Whatever.

68
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,833
We have to go
treasure hunting again?

69
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:35,958
Shino's calling us!

70
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,666
We have to go now!

71
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,291
What are you doing, teacher?

72
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,333
I almost left you behind!

73
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,000
I can't believe it,

74
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,208
this has got to be
the worst timing ever.

75
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,833
Sorry Tabby,
I'll just be another minute.

76
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,000
You go on ahead okay?

77
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,000
I'll catch up!

78
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,958
Hey, wait a second!

79
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,958
Oh! That was quick!

80
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:21,916
Don't just stand there.

81
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,333
Go on, have a seat.

82
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,375
What do ya want?

83
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,541
So, have you
made up your mind?

84
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,250
Have you decided
whether or not

85
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,458
you're going to join me?

86
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,708
Is it Haseo or me?

87
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,083
Tell me, which
one of us is it

88
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,208
that you want
or need more?

89
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,333
I'm the one who
asked the question.

90
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,166
Just answer me.

91
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,000
Don't be so
dim-witted, kid!

92
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,083
Huh?

93
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,333
If I were to come across

94
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,625
2 pieces of jewelry
on the ground,

95
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,208
which one would I pick?

96
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,041
The answer is easy!

97
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,208
I'd have to pick both
of them, of course!

98
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,458
Come on, don't tell me

99
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,166
you haven't any
business sense at all?

100
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,375
Business, huh?

101
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,291
Think about it
very carefully.

102
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,250
But remember...

103
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,083
It only took
a single e-mail

104
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,041
to get you to come
all the way here.

105
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:15,041
You wanted to see me
that badly, didn't you?

106
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,500
Did you know?

107
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,541
That you can see
the meteor shower tonight?

108
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,875
Come on, you're talking
about in the real world?

109
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,458
It has no value
and time is money!

110
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,041
Do you honestly
think I have time

111
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,875
for petty distractions
like a meteor shower?

112
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,250
I see.

113
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,041
Aww, really?

114
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,208
Sorry.

115
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,625
Hi!

116
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,250
Hey, what took so long?

117
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,291
Haseo won't be joining us
on this mission.

118
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,166
That doesn't matter to me.

119
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,125
Yeah, it doesn't
matter if Haseo comes

120
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,416
as long as
Sakisaka's with us. Right?

121
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,250
So, what are we
supposed to be doing here?

122
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,958
Today we're going to
focus on other fields,

123
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,458
instead of just
the Lost Grounds.

124
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,666
I want you to see if
you can find the Virus Core

125
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,666
in ordinary places,
like this dungeon.

126
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,500
Sounds like fun!

127
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,166
I'm gonna find every
one of those Virus Cores!

128
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,375
Teacher?

129
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,875
Alright!

130
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,416
Let's all three of us go in
there and find 'em together!

131
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,625
Actually, Shino
needs to take care

132
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,000
of some stuff
in the real world,

133
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,583
so today it's
just gonna be you and me.

134
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,125
I'm sorry.

135
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,458
Shino's probably
going on a date

136
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,458
to watch the meteor
shower with her boyfriend.

137
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,708
What?

138
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,125
I know! I know!

139
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,208
I bet Shino's pretty
and kind in person, too!

140
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,333
I'm sure men in the real
world can't leave her alone!

141
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,083
Tabby, that's not--

142
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,458
Don't worry about it!

143
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,250
Just leave this
to Teacher and me.

144
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,500
We can handle it.

145
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,458
You go enjoy your date
with your boyfriend!

146
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,625
Okay, let's go Teacher!

147
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,208
Hey, stop
calling me that!

148
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,958
Why can't I call
you that, Teacher?

149
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,166
How about Brother Sakisaka?

150
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,208
Not that, either!

151
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,583
Well, we'll be able
to see the stars soon.

152
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:09,000
Are you logging out?

153
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,416
Of course.

154
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,333
I haven't seen a meteor
shower since I was very young.

155
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,083
Bye for now.

156
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,041
See ya.

157
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,458
You don't even
have the slightest bit

158
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,000
of romance in you,
do you kid?

159
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,833
I wonder where it could be?

160
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:36,625
Oh Teacher, I always wanted
to do something like this.

161
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,041
It's like we're real
treasure hunters, isn't it?

162
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,375
Yeah, I guess.

163
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,541
What?! Tabby?

164
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,625
I really saw it!

165
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,541
I saw the meteor shower!

166
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,625
What?

167
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:57,958
You're talking
about the real world?

168
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,083
Can you see it from
your house as well?

169
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,125
Let's go.

170
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,291
Hey!

171
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,875
I asked if you can
see it from your house.

172
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,625
I told you that
it'd be impossible

173
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,708
to see it
from my apartment.

174
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:11,083
But Teacher,
it's so beautiful.

175
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,208
Am I going crazy or did
something just sparkle?

176
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,541
There you go,
you can see it!

177
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,500
No!

178
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,916
There's something
over there!

179
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,208
Be careful, Tabby.

180
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,125
I'm okay,
'cause you're with me!

181
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,458
Besides, we'll be
done here soon, right?

182
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,958
Sooner than you think.

183
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,625
There's a meteor shower
happening right now!

184
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,583
Really?

185
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,000
I can't see it
from my house.

186
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,958
Shooting stars...

187
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,291
I didn't even think of that.

188
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,750
They look like
falling stars!

189
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,083
I heard you the first time.

190
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,583
Now, you need to--huh?

191
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,916
What is this?

192
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,416
It's so pretty!

193
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,958
Huh?

194
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,583
Amazing!

195
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,458
No!

196
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,166
Tabby, send Shino
an e-mail now!

197
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,833
But didn't Shino say that
she was gonna log out today?

198
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,958
It doesn't matter--
it's an emergency.

199
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,416
Just send it
to all members!

200
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,208
Okay!

201
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,916
Alright...

202
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,083
Here I come.

203
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,791
What is this?

204
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,833
Tabby!

205
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,041
Tabby, let go, quickly!

206
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,708
But I can't
seem to get it off!

207
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:37,916
We need help right now.

208
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,458
Somebody has
to answer us!

209
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,416
I'll try e-mailing
one more time.

210
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,958
Tabby, don't be an idiot!

211
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,291
Just forget about it and
just worry about yourself!

212
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,083
Aw geez, I don't get it!

213
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,458
Why do we always have to
get screwed over like this?

214
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,500
Forget it Teacher,

215
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,750
you gotta move away from
me or you'll get hurt too!

216
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,500
No, I won't leave you.

217
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,333
It's the Player Killer!

218
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,583
You have to
run away, Teacher...

219
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,625
Or we're both gonna die!

220
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,166
Shut up!

221
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,083
Damn it.

222
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,041
Teacher, I'm so sorry...

223
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,750
Tabby, be strong!

224
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,000
Haseo... why you?

225
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,666
Hey Haseo!

226
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,708
You're late, as always!

227
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,500
I was just
about to log out.

228
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,958
You guys are a nuisance.

229
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,916
Haseo!

230
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,500
You're gonna wish
you did log out.

231
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,333
Haseo!

232
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,625
Hey little boy.

233
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,958
It's been awhile.

234
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,458
Oops, my bad.

235
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:24,875
Sorry to give you away!

236
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,375
Maybe I should have
said "Nice to meet you?"

237
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,916
to save you
from embarrassment.

238
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,541
Teacher she's lying...

239
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,333
She's lying... right?

240
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,041
You don't know her...

241
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,958
Do you, Teacher?

242
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:45,791
Please tell me
you don't know her ...

243
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,708
Answer me!

244
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,708
Boy Sakisaka,
you're a disappointment.

245
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:56,958
I thought you could've
actually been useful to us.

246
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,458
Oh, just deal with it.

247
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,791
I'll do you last.

248
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,250
Now wait here,
you little traitor.

249
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:09,583
I'm gonna have fun
with you first!

250
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,833
Help Teacher!

251
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,916
We have to help
Haseo or he'll die!

252
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,375
Come on!

253
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,083
I won't kill
him that quickly!

254
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,791
Don't worry about that!

255
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,958
You should be more worried
about the terrible things

256
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,291
I'm going to do
to you, silly girl.

257
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:34,416
Teacher!

258
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,583
Did you finally muster
up the courage,

259
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,458
or do ya wanna die?

260
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,708
Not just yet.

261
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:49,958
Did you happen to know

262
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,375
that you can see the
meteor shower tonight?

263
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,125
I'm not interested.

264
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,541
Of course you aren't.

265
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,791
If you had made
it easy for me

266
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,458
I would have
simply PKed you.

267
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,000
Now I'm gonna
make it hurt!

268
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,791
Sakisaka.

269
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,833
Careful Teacher!

270
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,583
Listen Tabby,
I have a confession.

271
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,666
You convinced me
to take a look outside,

272
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,166
and I can see
the meteor shower.

273
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:23,166
Teacher.

274
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,375
Are you okay?!
