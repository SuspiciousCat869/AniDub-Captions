We don't even know

It's almost like
the speculations

are just
breeding more rumors.

Doesn't that happen
a lot on the forum anyway?

You're right.

originated from Ovan himself...

That's my take.

Ovan? But why?

00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,166
I mean, do you
actually know Ovan?

99
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,458
To give and take.

100

It's the principle
of business.

What?!

117

Plants are very
mysterious things.

118
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,750
Even if you forget
that you planted the seed,

119
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,083
when the season arrives
it will naturally sprout.

120
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,125
And when its time
for them to die,

121
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,625
they leave new seeds.

122
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,083
The cycle can
then be perpetuated

123

by providing water,
light and nutrients.

Give and take.

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,916
That is the principle
of business.

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,458

Uh-huh?

Y'know, I just
don't understand.

Why is Ovan so
interested in him?

146
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,250
Beats me.

147
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,916
Either way, Ovan's
interested in Haseo...

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,708
So it really doesn't
matter what we think of him.

149
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:19,666
Well, as long as Ovan holds
his interest in the newbie...

we as TaN have
got to make our move now.

What?

166
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,333
You don't know
what a guest key is?

167
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,958
How should I?

168
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,583
You joining
the Twilight Brigade?

169
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,416
You haven't
joined a guild right?

170
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,375
You know...

171
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,375
You should join our guild.

172
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,791
As long as you
have that guest key

173
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,250
you can enter
the Twilight Brigade's @HOME.

174
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:47,500
Ovan's waiting for you.

175
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,250
I know you're also waiting

176
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,916
to meet Ovan again.

177
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,750
Ovan.

178
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,458
Shino's waiting as well!

179
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,541
Oh come on!

180
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,583
Excuse me.

181
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,916
What?

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,375
Close your eyes
for just a minute.

183
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,916
Oh nice try.

184
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I close my eyes
and you run away?

185
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,750
No...

186
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,833
I won't close my eyes!

187
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,958
I can't do it!

188
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,833
Um... Uh-what?

189
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:38,833
I thought I could keep
from shutting my eyes,

190
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,958
but I kept them
open in reality too.

191
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:45,458
Oh, they're
all watery now!

192
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:51,125
You're getting on my nerves.

193
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,333
Nya!

194
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,416
Ovan.

195
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,791
Have you made up
your mind yet?

196
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,583
Was that you?

197
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,500
Did you make that happen?

198
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,833
Huh?

199
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,166
What do you mean?

200
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,708
Just a second!

201
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,916
Don't play dumb!

202
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,750
What the heck was that?

203
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,291
What did you see?

204
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,916
Tell me what you saw.

205
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,583
I guess... it wasn't you.

206
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,458
Now I see.

207
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:37,125
I'm no longer surprised
why Ovan has his eye on you.

208
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:42,000
Because there is
something special about you.

209
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,750
The question is...

210
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:50,375
Who will you choose to give
that "something special" to?

211
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,666
[PC 3F ]
Hey, that guy...

212
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,958
[PC 3G]
Yeah, that's the guy

213
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:54,958
everybody's talking
about in the forum, Haseo.

214
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,500
[PC 3F]
No way!

215
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,416
And that's Tawaraya
from TaN with him!

216
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,083
Consider the
consequences of saying no

217
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,875
to the invitation
to our guild.

218
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,791
Think about it
very carefully.

219
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,958
I don't know.

220
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,250
[PC 3F] Wow, he's
already getting scouted.

221
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,000
[PC 3G] Yeah, of course
TaN's not gonna

222
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,125
ignore someone like that.

223
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,666
I don't know!

224
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,416
Oh I don't know!

225
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,916
He said I was getting on his
nerves and then he just left.

226
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,666
Am I annoying, Sakisaka?

227
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,083
Am I annoying?

228
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,833
I'm not annoying, am I?

229
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:33,750
Right?

230
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,000
Right?

231
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,000
[SAKISAKA] Well...

232
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,416
Well?

233
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
I'm perplexed
that I tolerate you,

234
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,166
and I'm surprised that
I still hang out with you.

235
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,750
Oh! There it is!

236
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,208
Your catchphrase!

237
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,541
Why, thank you!

238
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,416
So, answer my question!

239
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,750
Why, thank you.

240
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,666
I said answer my question!

241
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,416
Ovan, I think I need to
meet with Haseo one more time.

242
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,291
What for?

243
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:03,000
Well I...

244
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:08,583
It appears that TaN has already
started to make their move.

245
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,583
If Haseo decides...

246
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,250
Everything here
has been predetermined.

247
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:19,875
Haseo is...

248
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,875
Become stronger, huh?

249
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,166
Well ask me already.

250
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:46,000
Ask what?

251
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:51,208
Nevermind.

252
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,541
See ya.

253
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,166
Okay.

254
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,750
Not surprising.

255
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,166
So...

256
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,583
Waddya think
we should do now?

257
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,333
Who knows?

258
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:51,416
But, one thing
is absolutely certain.

259
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,625
There's definitely no doubt
that Haseo's existence

260
00:20:55,708 --> 00:21:05,666
has become vitally
important to Ovan.

261
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:12,458
has become vitally
important to Ovan.

262
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,416
Haseo, welcome to the--

263
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,791
It's okay...

264
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,375
I can let myself in.

265
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:54,208
All I did was plant
the seed, nothing more.

266
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,250
About the rumors
that are accusing you

267
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:01,833
of posting those
messages on the forum.

268
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,875
What were you doing?

269
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:07,250
Ah, hmm...

270
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,791
Well I...
