Huh?

00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,958
Papa, where are
you going today?

00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,333
Papa?

6
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,666
We just thought of doing
a little role-playing!

7
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,291
You're annoying!

8
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,916
[SEISAKU] Hideyo,
I thought you said

9
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,500
that Touta was the Papa.

10
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,375
Oh, ah, yeah that's right.

11
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,375
But I guess if we're
gonna use the family analogy,

12
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,333
I think Haseo would
be kinda more like the Papa.

13
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:35,916
Huh? Oh...

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,291
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,333
You don't have to
apologize, Hideyo.

16
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:40,666
She's right.

17
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,041
I dunno though,

18
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,916

like Haseo doesn't like us.

Isn't this a
little unnecessary?

Tri-Edge is a
Player Killer too!

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,750
If I keep hunting PKers,
it'll eventually lead to him.

30

Is that really
your only reason?

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,583
And him?

32
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,541
Can you honestly
say you needed

33
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,291
a reason to kill that guy?

about the dot hackers?

Well yeah...

66
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,333
it's part of the game's story.

67
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,083
It's not a story,
it's real...

68

...just like the power
that dwells within your PC.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,750
It originates from something
beyond the system specs.

70
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,583
In The World
there is a factor

71
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,375
that does not
exist in the specs.

72
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,125
Our duty as Raven is first
find a way to control it

73
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:36,416
and second, to find an
explanation for why it exists.

74
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
And how do you expect me

75
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,041
to accept this
all of a sudden?

76

That's why
I was telling you

that it's too early
for you to come in here.

some new information?

Yes.

Regarding the situation
involving Haseo.

wanna talk about?

Yeah. But why?

Tell him to be careful.

00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,541
Be careful?

Yeah.

00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,333
The Player Killers
have targeted him.

You do?

91
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,583
It's obvious that if
he recklessly goes around

92
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:31,666
killing so many PKs he'll
have to pay for it eventually.

93
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,291
But why...

94
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,666
What reason would he
need for being so reckless?

95
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,583
I dunno...

96
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,500
It's kind of a long story.

Well, when you feel
like it, let me know.

101
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,125
I'm wondering...

102
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,666
how can someone end up having
several dozen PKs after him.

103
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,166
It really seems odd.

What are you talking about?

106

Well, there are rumors that
all the PKs who hate Haseo

107
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:06,416
are gathering together
to gang up on him.

108

That's what you meant...

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,416

00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,666
I'm sure he's already
caught wind of the rumors.

113
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,250
No I'm sure he hasn't.

'Cause Haseo's all over
the place right now.

116
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,708
Then it's about time that
someone sets him straight.

117
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,916
It'll be good
medicine for him.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,166
Don't you think
that's a little too harsh?

119
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,166
It's only a game.

120
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,875
Even if he experiences
something bad,

121
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,458
it's not real,
so it won't matter.

122

Yeah, but...

123
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,166
He'll end up having
to endure bad experiences

124
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,583
if he carries on like that;

125
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:55,083
regardless of whether it's
in the game or in real life.

126
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,666
Haseo should
come to realize that.

127
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,500
That's enough.

128

00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,583
Just a little more!

168
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,291
You guys can win!

169
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,125
It's beginning.

170
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,833
Where are you?

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,333
TaN? No it can't be.

172
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,291
Did you know
that hidden items

173
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,583
were being
lent out for free?

174
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,625
So that's what this is.

175
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,791
I'll take you all on!

176
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,708
It's like this?

177
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,500
Be strong Mama!

178
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,250
You little pests are
getting on my nerves!

179
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,166
What do we do?

180
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,000
Huh?

181
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:27,833
There're so many,

182
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,000
we can't be healing

183
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,875
and reviving everyone
in this situation.

184
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,166
We should focus
on Haseo, right?

185
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,833
Good idea.

186
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,416
Let's do it.

187
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,166
This is way
too much for him!

188
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,625
Yeah.

189
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,333
Let's support
our Papa, Haseo!

190
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,083
Even if I die I'll keep fighting
and continue to heal you!

191
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,625
We are...

192
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:55,458
The Paw Pad Squadron!

193
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,583
What's up?

194
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,291
[TOUTA/TAWARAYA]
I'm guessing

195
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,458
that it must
be very important...

196
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:13,458
for you to have
to send me a message.

197
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,625
I did hesitate a bit.

198
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,833
I've had more than
enough of you guys!

199
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:25,958
You're wasting your time trying
to use those useless items!

200
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,791
Haseo!

201
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,666
Haseo?

202
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:35,750
Mama!

203
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:36,583
Hideyo!

204
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,333
Mama!

205
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,291
Hideyo!

206
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,666
Hideyo!

207
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,083
Mamaaaaa!

208
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,791
Hideyoooo!

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,208
Here I come!

210
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,083
I understand
what you're saying,

211
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,583
but I don't understand
why you're telling me this.

212
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,750
You expect me to go
out there and stop it?

213
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,083
It's probably too
late at this point.

214
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:03,541
My guess is it's already
started and out of our control.

215
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:08,000
What are you scheming?

216
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,125
I'm not scheming anything.

217
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:17,500
I'd just like you to find out
who set the trap this time.

218
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,500
Think you can
do that for me?

219
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,333
Alright!

220
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,666
I guess I'll go have
a look into it then.

221
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,708
Outta my way!

222
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,625
Papa is...

223
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:35,958
Haseo! Hold on!

224
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,375
We're gonna heal you.

225
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,125
It's no use, we're too far
to heal him from out here.

226
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,458
I need you to go
catch a Player Killer.

227
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,208
We're gonna sell one?

228
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,583
I'm pretty sure
no one would buy him.

229
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,250
I just want
to talk to one.

230
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,625
I'm sure you can
convince one with money.

231
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,708
We meet again!

232
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,250
You!

233
00:13:58,666 --> 00:13:59,916
Everybody stay back!

234
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,958
This guy's mine!

235
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,708
Let's help Papa Haseo

236
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,625
I did it!

237
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,083
Haseo!

238
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,416
We were just in time!

239
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,666
Who are they?

240
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,958
Whaddaya think you're
doing helping Haseo?

241
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,125
We have to
stay close to him.

242
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,583
[SABURO] Wow, this
really is a Haseo festival!

243
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,208
There's only about
half of them left.

244
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,875
I've never seen healing
supporters accompanying a PK.

245
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,083
Get out of the way!

246
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,708
Not so fast!

247
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,291
You want some too?

248
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,208
Oh no!

249
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:52,833
Cut it out!
Stop it! Stop it!

250
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,583
You're next!

251
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,666
And where do you think
you fellows are going huh?

252
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,666
Don't think you can get
away with eating sushi,

253
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,166
using cutlery, and having
your miso soup after dessert.

254
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,250
What did you say?

255
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,750
It's a little
cowardly that you attack

256
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,666
with such a large force and
as soon as it gets dangerous

257
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,250
you run away to get
recovery medicine.

258
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,666
Okay, you should
go back now!

259
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,041
Which side are you on?

260
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,500
Who me? I'm just watching.

261
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,750
[BORDEAUX] So I'm
guessing you're the one

262
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,291
who wants to talk to me?

263
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,250
I heard you and your friends
are trying to gang up on Haseo.

264
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,458
Trying to?

265
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,500
We're actually in
the process of doing it.

266
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:01,041
I see. Then why aren't
you there with them?

267
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,250
Never mind...
what did you want?

268
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:07,333
Who's idea
was this? Tell me.

269
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,583
What will you do about it?

270
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,583
Don't worry, I'll decide
once I know who it is.

271
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,458
Do you know who it is?

272
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,666
What if I...
said it was me?

273
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,458
I'd say, "how come"?

274
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,750
Because that kid's
a pain in the neck.

275
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,083
Everyone thinks so,
not just me.

276
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,291
You don't really
think that many people

277
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,750
would get together
just for a costume party?

278
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,041
That's it then?

279
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,833
Well not entirely.

280
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,041
Okay, tell me the rest.

281
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,500
After Haseo
earns the reputation

282
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,541
of defeating
100 Player Killers,

283
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,250
my party will take him on.

284
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,166
And when we
finally defeat him

285
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,916
everyone will
respect us as superiors.

286
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,416
That's the reason
why I'm not there today.

287
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,250
Oh, that's
what this is about?

288
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,125
You can run away now!

289
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,250
Haseo.

290
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,208
I didn't get any proof.

291
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,625
But for the most part I think
your worries are unnecessary.

292
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,125
You say "my worries"?

293
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,291
That's right.

294
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,875
I can tell that
you're worried that Haseo

295
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,250
might get lured into some
kind of grand conspiracy.

296
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,916
What happened?

297
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,916
My cat just
scratched my foot.

298
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,583
What are you
fooling around for?

299
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:40,625
And?

300
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,750
Well there's nothing
to worry about, really--

301
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,666
it's pretty
trivial and unimportant.

302
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,125
Tell me something.

303
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,250
Are you still planning on
supporting Haseo like this?

304
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,458
I'm sorry, I...

305
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,291
I don't want
a Papa like that!

306
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:22,083
I don't think I can
continue to help him either.

307
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,750
But!

308
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,083
But I think supporting Haseo...

309
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:32,458
Enough. Let's go!

310
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,666
It happened.
I'm all by myself again.

311
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,125
[SHINO]
Haseo.

312
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:49,708
Hey! Please, please hurry!

313
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:10,666
Shino! Sh-Shino.

314
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:21,125
I will not...
forgive him for this!

315
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:34,916
Why are--

316
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,625
Don't ever
follow me again!

317
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,250
Haseo.

318
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't need anybody's help.

319
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:25,083
I'm gonna do this on my own!
