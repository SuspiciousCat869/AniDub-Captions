1
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,916
[SAKISAKA]
What just happened?

2
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,958
[TABBY]
Weren't we here earlier?

3
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,291
[SAKISAKA]
Hmm...

4
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,291
[SAKISAKA]
Did we get transported?

5
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,083
[SAKISAKA] Is this some
sort of transporting device?

6
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,125
We should go right
back to those towers.

7
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,916
Let's go somewhere else.

8
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,291
I think if we keep looking,

9
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,833
there might be a chance
we'll find the same patterns

10
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,291
in the other Lost Grounds.

11
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,750
Did you forget that we're
looking for the Virus Cores?

12
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,916
I might be wrong, but I
don't think those patterns

13
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,875
have anything to do
with our search.

14
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,125
We don't know that.

15
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,041
What if they are
related somehow?

16
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,583
Come on. Let's go!

17
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,708
[SAKISAKA groans]

18
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, okay, fine.

19
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,875
Haseo, we're going
to the next place.

20
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,458
Yeah. Alright.

21
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,166
[TABBY gasping in surprise]

22
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,708
Oh, wow!

23
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,916
Where... are we?

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,041
Is it your first time here?

25
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,125
Yeah.

26
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,083
Have you been
to this place before?

27
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,125
Yeah.

28
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,916
There used to be a
statue of a girl here,

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,333
but that was a
very long time ago.

30
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,458
[OVAN]
That's right, Haseo.

31
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,000
It's important to
recognize this game

32
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,791
has a very
mysterious autonomy.

33
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,208
Aura.

34
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,583
That was the name
they used to call her.

35
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,333
Neither the system administrator
nor any other entity

36
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,708
can control it.

37
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,916
In fact, parts of the world
are completely governed

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,958
by the rules of
the game itself.

39
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,208
Maybe she just lost
interest in the end,

40
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,250
lost hope for this world.

41
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,833
It does.

42
00:03:55,916 --> 00:04:00,083
You must play this game with the
assumption that it does exist.

43
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,291
That is why we are known
as the Twilight Brigade.

44
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:15,583
Hey, Haseo, you in the bathroom?

45
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,250
[SAKISAKA]
Hurry up!

46
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,750
Coming!

47
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:19,791
[TABBY giggles]

48
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,666
Okay! Let's go!

49
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,708
Hey!

50
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,666
How are we supposed
to find these things?

51
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,250
I really don't think
it's gonna be very easy

52
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,958
to find an item that's
not listed in the specs.

53
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,875
[SAKISAKA]
I've never seen you like that.

54
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,541
What?
--It's not important.

55
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,750
Anyway, I don't think
there are any here.

56
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:08,375
[HASEO] Yeah, I doubt they'd put
the item in a place like this.

57
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,416
This is a pretty special
area, so I thought

58
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,625
maybe we'd find at least
one of the Virus Cores here.

59
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,125
Didn't Shino tell you?

60
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,791
The Lost Grounds
are unusual areas

61
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:21,208
that can't be touched
by anyone or anything.

62
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,041
I already know that.

63
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,250
[SAKISAKA] Not even the
administrator can modify

64
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,333
or delete it.

65
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,833
It appears and
disappears randomly.

66
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,833
Just like that last transport.

67
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,791
That would have been
impossible in the normal areas.

68
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,250
[HASEO]
I guess.

69
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,875
[SAKISAKA] But in the Lost
Ground, it becomes possible.

70
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:40,750
[TABBY screams]

71
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:41,791
--Huh?
--Huh?

72
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,125
[SAKISAKA]
Tabby!

73
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,000
Where'd she go?

74
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,583
Tabby, where are you?

75
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,916
Haseo, send her
an e-mail, right now!

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,458
Huh?

77
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,416
Hurry up!

78
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,916
I think I saw her
searching here.

79
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,750
[HASEO] I don't think
the e-mail went through.

80
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,916
[SAKISAKA screams]

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,583
Sakisaka...?

82
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,833
Where are you?

83
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:17,541
[ENDER]
Oh, my. Are you alone?

84
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:21,041
Aren't your friends with you?

85
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,500
Listen lady, That is
none of your business.

86
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,333
[ENDER]
C'mon kid, take it easy.

87
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,291
Don't hide things from me.

88
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,333
Now where did they go?

89
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,416
Three came in here,
but now there's only one.

90
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,083
What's going on?

91
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,750
If you don't answer me
now, you might end up dead.

92
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,041
[ringing noise]

93
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,583
[ENDER] Too bad,
something's come up.

94
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,333
See ya later.

95
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,125
[GORD]
Who has the Virus Core?

96
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,250
If you don't tell me,
I'll PK you.

97
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,666
Why are you after us?

98
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,750
Is it 'cause we're
members of Kestrel?

99
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:13,750
Yeah!

100
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,250
Why? You got a
problem with that?

101
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,500
It's only a rumor.

102
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,750
I don't know anything
about any Virus Cores.

103
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:19,791
I swear it!

104
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,416
I told you,
I don't know anything.

105
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,166
[GORD]
Oh man. You're useless.

106
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,708
Revive him and get out of here.

107
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,416
[BOY 1A]
Rip Maen.

108
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,416
Dude, I'm sorry!

109
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,666
I got stuck at work.

110
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,250
What's up with that craziness?

111
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,833
[GORD] Just my own little
way of collecting information.

112
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,250
[NASUBI] I can't believe
you're using violence

113
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,500
to get it out of them.

114
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,583
[GORD] Whatever.
Did you find any leads?

115
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,250
[NASUBI]
Well, something, but I...

116
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,333
[GORD]
What?

117
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,833
[NASUBI] I think
it's gonna be trouble.

118
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,500
[GORD] I've heard rumors that
it's someone from Kestrel.

119
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,083
Who is it?

120
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,208
[NASUBI]
Bordeaux.

121
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,625
You know who that is.

122
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,208
A player killer.

123
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,750
[NASUBI] It fell into her
hands purely by coincidence.

124
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,375
Very interesting.

125
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,416
Welcome back.

126
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,333
[HASEO]
Have you seen the others?

127
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,916
I heard about what happened.

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,166
Huh?

129
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,750
[SHINO] Sakisaka is
working by himself now.

130
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,125
But Sakisaka disappeared!

131
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,250
Yes, he did.

132
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,833
But, it's okay, I'll explain.

133
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,541
I'm pretty sure Tabby
will be back soon, as well.

134
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,541
Not here, huh?

135
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,041
[ENDER]
What are you doing?

136
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,125
[TAWARAYA]
Ender!

137
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,041
I just wanted
to ask you something.

138
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,916
Well, what is it?

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,916
Apparently, there's
more than one of these.

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,500
You know, it's not a
good idea to keep that here.

141
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,250
[TAWARAYA]
But I can't just let it go.

142
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,125
Either way,
they're gonna come for it.

143
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,875
So. What about you?

144
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,750
Have they made their move yet?

145
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:08,750
Taken the bait?

146
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,416
Disappeared.

147
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,000
Anyway, I think they'll
probably meet at Mac Anu,

148
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,250
so I'll just rest until then.

149
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,125
[TAWARAYA] What do
you mean "disappeared"?

150
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,708
The scars.

151
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,041
Haven't you heard about these
anomalies in the Lost Ground?

152
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,458
Oh! That's right.

153
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,125
I've heard those scars
can even distort the graphics.

154
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,083
I was thinking I should
name them pretty soon.

155
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,333
TaN is on the leading
edge of any trend.

156
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,708
We gotta live up
to our reputation.

157
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,250
So, what about them?

158
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,291
They seem to work
as a transporter.

159
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,375
So that's how you
lost the Twilight Brigade.

160
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,625
Where'd it happen?

161
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,916
Shut up, I didn't lose them.

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,208
[TAWARAYA]
Oh, it doesn't matter.

163
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,208
Where was it?

164
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,750
Hulle Granz Cathedral.

165
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,083
Oh!

166
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,625
That's the Lost Ground
that was just discovered.

167
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:59,625
[GORD] So I can find this
Bordeaux character there, huh?

168
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,416
Will you let me
ask you something?

169
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,416
Only if it's a question
I can answer.

170
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,583
Why on earth are you
spending so much time and energy

171
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,583
trying to get the Virus Cores?

172
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,625
And why do you
want to defeat Ovan?

173
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,583
How else am I gonna prove
that I'm better than he is?

174
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,041
What a childish motive!

175
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,541
...and before I knew it,
there was this flash

176
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,000
and I was inside of the wall.

177
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,000
There were all these weird
lines and stuff everywhere.

178
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,250
And I tried real hard to move,
but I couldn't, and I realized

179
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,750
I couldn't log off normally.

180
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,625
So I had to reboot
and log back on.

181
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,166
Where did Sakisaka go?

182
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,083
Don't worry.
Sakisaka is safe,

183
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,083
he's just working alone
for a little while.

184
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,250
Oh.

185
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,250
Sakisaka got hit by
a bug like you did.

186
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,000
But he came back right away.
He's off on a another task.

187
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,791
He was confused, but he's fine.

188
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,041
That's my teacher!

189
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,791
I was panicking and
struggling for quite a while.

190
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,750
I have to admit
I was a little confused,

191
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,125
and couldn't
recognize it was a bug.

192
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,458
Also, after hearing
what happened to Haseo,

193
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,416
I think it's too dangerous
for the three of you

194
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,000
to work together for now.

195
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,458
What do you mean?

196
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,541
After you and
Sakisaka disappeared,

197
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,541
that freak Ender showed up.

198
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,833
[SHINO] It's likely
you're being followed.

199
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,333
You must be very cautious.

200
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,333
Hmm.

201
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,000
[HASEO] So, what are
we supposed to do now?

202
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,583
[SHINO] Tabby, I want you
to continue searching

203
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,916
for the Virus Cores.

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,291
[TABBY]
Okay!

205
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,583
What about me?

206
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,416
I'd like you to check
out the information

207
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,791
you brought us about
the Key of the Twilight.

208
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,625
Information about...

209
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,083
... the Key?

210
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,833
The information you brought
to us regarding the items

211
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,041
that aren't listed in the
specs, and without them,

212
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,583
we'll be unable
to find the location

213
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,291
of the Key of the Twilight.

214
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,958
Don't you remember, Haseo?

215
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,916
Yeah, I do.

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,500
Good luck, you two!

217
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,041
Just hand it over,
and you'll spare yourselves

218
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,083
pain and embarrassment.

219
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,750
[BORDEAUX] Is this thing
really that important?

220
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,208
The item isn't even
worth anything to you.

221
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,541
[BORDEAUX laughing]

222
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,875
I guess sometimes it's okay...

223
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,291
...to become a
Player Killer Killer!

224
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,375
[SHINO]
You're still here.

225
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,166
[HASEO] Hey, the items
that aren't in the specs

226
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,625
are these Virus Cores, right?

227
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,000
[SHINO]
Probably.

228
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,083
Have a look.

229
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,291
Exactly how many of
these things are there?

230
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,750
If the rumors are true,

231
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,666
then there must be as many
as there are Lost Grounds...

232
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,750
So, six then.

233
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,083
But it's interesting...

234
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,500
These two are different colors.

235
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,583
Maybe the other ones
are also different?

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,125
You really don't think you
can take me down, do you?

237
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,666
I admire you for having the
courage to fight by yourself.

238
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,333
But it means nothing
if you're gonna end up dead!

239
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,333
Carelessness is
your worst enemy.

240
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,291
I'm a pro at fooling people.

241
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,166
[BORDEAUX]
Wait!

242
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,708
You can have it!

243
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,166
That's all you want right?

244
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,375
You're not putting
up much of a fight.

245
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,916
[BORDEAUX]
Always know your limits.

246
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,416
Damn you!

247
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,416
Now, are you gonna behave
yourself and give it to me?

248
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,916
[BORDEAUX]
Who are you?

249
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,791
Saving the weak!
Defeating the strong!

250
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,208
I am known as the PK of Justice!

251
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,833
But you can call me Gord.

252
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,541
All right. You win.

253
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,916
Here, take it!

254
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,458
Thanks for the gift.

255
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,875
More than anything else...

256
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,750
trust is the key
to good business.

257
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,666
I wonder how I
should hand it over.

258
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,666
What do you see?

259
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,875
[HASEO]
Hold on!

260
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,666
I think there's some
kind of significance

261
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,333
to the glowing lights
in these towers.

262
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,625
[SHINO]
What do you mean?

263
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,166
Maybe this is where
we're supposed to use

264
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,708
the Virus Cores.

265
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,500
[SHINO]
Haseo!

266
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,916
I'm pretty sure we
only need three more.

267
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,458
I bet we're gonna have to
find the colors that match

268
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,583
the rest of these towers.

269
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,250
[SHINO] Five Virus Cores
plus one for the final level.

270
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,708
There should be six in total--

271
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,291
as many as there
are Lost Grounds

272
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,333
that have been discovered.

273
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,791
[HASEO]
We have to tell Ovan!

274
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,000
[SHINO]
I'll tell him.

275
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:38,250
[SHINO] What will you do if you
find the Key of the Twilight?

276
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,000
[HASEO]
I don't know.

277
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,375
What about you?

278
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,583
[SHINO]
I think I'll...

279
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,666
...keep it a secret.

280
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,166
What do you mean?

281
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,041
Tell me, Shino,
what are you to Ovan?

282
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,041
No more than
an acquaintance...

283
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,666
...in the real world.

284
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,166
I'm going now.

285
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,416
I have to go let Ovan know.

286
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,833
Oh, I'll go with you.

287
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,083
Uh-uh. No, Haseo.

288
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,291
You keep looking
for the Virus Cores.

289
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,708
[HASEO groans softly]

290
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,041
I'm asking you.

291
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,041
Follow Ovan's wishes.
Thank you.

292
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,666
Follow Ovan's wishes.

293
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,041
[OVAN]
Welcome back.

294
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,500
[SHINO]
Did you get my e-mail?

295
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,000
[OVAN]
Yes.

296
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,666
An amazing discovery, even
if it did happen by accident!

297
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,916
[SHINO]
Is work going okay?

298
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,166
[OVAN]
Yeah.

299
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,333
I really hope that we
can find it this time.

300
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,916
[OVAN]
As do I.

301
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,708
It's about time.

302
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,041
[SHINO]
Yes.

303
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:10,958
[OVAN]
If we...

304
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,583
[SHINO]
Huh?

305
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,750
[OVAN] If we find the
Key of the Twilight,

306
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,583
I think I'm going to
leave for a little while.

307
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,583
[SHINO]
Huh?

308
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,458
[OVAN]
If you can't reach me...

309
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,708
[SHINO]
What?

310
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,416
[OVAN]
Don't worry.

311
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,083
Did I just hear you say 'if"?

312
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,625
That's not like you at all.

313
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,166
And if I...

314
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,500
If I don't worry
about you, who will?

315
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,583
You'll push yourself too hard.

316
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,458
[OVAN]
The time has come.

317
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,125
[NAOBI] They've begun
working separately.

318
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,916
[ENDER] Do you want
me to follow them?

319
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,375
[NAOBI]
Just Haseo.

320
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,458
If he enters phase one,
you may commence.

321
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,125
I understand.

322
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,875
Tawaraya has one of the Cores.

323
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,750
What do you want me
to do about that?

324
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,958
[NAOBI]
Ovan is always thinking ahead.

325
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,791
Don't tell Tawaraya anything.

326
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,125
[ENDER]
Yes.

327
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,083
Every one of the Virus Cores

328
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,583
that have been found so far
were discovered in and around

329
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,375
the six Lost Grounds.

330
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,958
Here's another one.

331
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,458
It happened again.

332
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,500
What is this?

333
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,958
Where am I?

334
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,958
This is for Ovan's wishes.

335
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,791
It's him.

336
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,583
Well it looks as
though that damn Ovan

337
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,458
is about to make his move.

338
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,333
[ENDER] I've completed the
preparations as you requested.

339
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,666
[NAOBI]
Good work.

340
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,083
[ENDER] I'm hoping that
it will operate smoothly.

341
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,458
[NAOBI]
Are you uncertain?

342
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,375
[ENDER]
I'm not.

343
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,416
[NAOBI] What I want
is Ovan's character data.

344
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,791
As long as you can
transfer the data,

345
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,333
there's nothing
to worry about.

346
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,250
[ENDER]
Yes.

347
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,083
[NAOBI]
If you can trap Ovan,

348
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,916
everything after that
will follow as planned.

349
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,833
[ENDER]
Is that okay?

350
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:31,083
[NAOBI]
The guild has done a lot...

351
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,791
More than I expected.

352
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,625
I understand.

353
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,875
[OVAN] The path to the Key of
the Twilight has been opened.

354
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,500
[TABBY cheers]

355
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,791
Each one of the Virus
Cores is a different color,

356
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,541
and there are towers
with matching colors

357
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,333
in the Coite-Bodher area.

358
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,333
I think we can safely
assume that is where

359
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,708
the collected Virus Cores
are to be used.

360
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,500
I don't remember
anything like that.

361
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,166
Really? You can't recall
the five little towers?

362
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,333
Oh... I remember.

363
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,083
But don't you agree
it's probably kinda...

364
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,500
I mean, isn't it
a little too easy?

365
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,541
We couldn't be
that lucky, could we?

366
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah, Yeah.

367
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,583
[OVAN]
The Key of the Twilight.

368
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:33,250
It can turn the core program
of this game upside down,

369
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,875
shaking the foundations
of The World.

370
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:39,000
It exists within
the program...

371
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,250
Or it may live
within the program.

372
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,583
Is there more than one?

373
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,333
Or only one?

374
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,083
It would be enough
to answer this question alone.

375
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,958
[OVAN] This is our only chance
to get a head start on TaN.

376
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,625
[OVAN]
The time for action...

377
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:17,916
...has come.

378
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,333
Let's do it.

379
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,625
Now!
