1
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,625
[TOHTA]
So you're alright.

2
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,125
Well then, Haseo, what happened
to all of your weapons?

3
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,541
I'm not too sure.

4
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,666
[TOHTA] I guess that's what it
means to be initialized,

5
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,708
doesn't it?

6
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,250
[TOHTA]
Oh, nothing.

7
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,875
I'm glad you're safe.

8
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,000
[TOHTA]
Haseo!

9
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,125
Phyllo is not coming back.

10
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,041
[HASEO]
What?

11
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,333
[TOHTA]
He didn't actually quit,

12
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,458
but I guess
it's the same thing.

13
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,583
[HASEO]
I don't get it.

14
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,500
[TOHTA]
We have no privacy here.

15
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,208
We need to go somewhere else.

16
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,541
I have something to tell you.

17
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,875
[OVAN]
Shino.

18
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,541
It's starting now.

19
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,833
[TABBY]
I need to report to Shino.

20
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,458
What's that?

21
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,041
Oh, it's nothing.

22
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,416
No way.

23
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,916
Phyllo was in the
game the whole time

24
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,416
just hangin' around.

25
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,333
He never did anything
other than sit on the bridge

26
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,083
staring at the water.

27
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,041
That's right.
He was always there.

28
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,000
And he was worried about you
until his last days.

29
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,083
[HASEO]
But why--

30
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,166
At the very end,

31
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,125
Phyllo specifically asked
me to look out for you.

32
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,666
I just don't understand.

33
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,708
Really?

34
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:48,750
[HASEO]
Knowing he had cancer

35
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,791
with only eight
months left to live,

36
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,625
how could he continue
to calmly play the game?

37
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,791
And he was worrying about me?

38
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:59,208
He should have been worrying
about himself, not me!

39
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,708
[TOHTA]
He couldn't help it.

40
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:03,875
Phyllo...

41
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,583
Phyllo had taken care of
everything around him

42
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,750
and all he had left to
worry about was you.

43
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,750
[HASEO]
But--

44
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,083
What would you do

45
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,583
if you were told you had
just eight months to live?

46
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,958
Do you know?

47
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,250
What?

48
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,791
[TOHTA]
Would you be anxious?

49
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,125
Or depressed?

50
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,083
Or would you frantically
try to achieve something

51
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,375
so that you could
leave behind a legacy?

52
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,125
Those are about
the only possibilities

53
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,625
people like us
can imagine, right?

54
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,166
Well, I... I guess.

55
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,833
[TOHTA] Phyllo didn't
choose any of those paths.

56
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,166
During his last few days,

57
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,916
he wanted to
live them out calmly,

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,500
as though nothing had changed.

59
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,000
And that was how
he wanted to live his life.

60
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,166
Calmly, huh?

61
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,416
While it is true Phyllo
knew he was dying,

62
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,916
he also knew that those of us

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,333
who aren't dealing
with an illness

64
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,666
could very well die
tomorrow or the next day

65
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,250
in an accident.

66
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,541
"Now who do you
think is the one...

67
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,750
...who'd feel regret
in the end?"

68
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,125
Yeah, Phyllo said
that with a chuckle.

69
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,375
He told me that
you're trying to do

70
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,125
too much by yourself.

71
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,500
And that he was overly harsh...

72
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,125
...and regretted it.

73
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,125
I guess.

74
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,208
To be honest,
I mostly ignored him.

75
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,625
Wrote him off
as just a nuisance.

76
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,666
That's all.

77
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,583
Remember this:

78
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,291
"Whatever happens, you
have to stick to your guns."

79
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,125
That's Phyllo's message to you.

80
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,458
Right, as if I need it.

81
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,791
[PI]
Master Yata,

82
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,291
I've found the
unidentified phenomena.

83
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,125
[YATA]
Where's Kuhn?

84
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,875
I believe he's
in the main room.

85
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,416
[YATA]
Destroy the target.

86
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,416
If possible, get a sample.

87
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,333
Yes.

88
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,708
So what's up?
Something new happening?

89
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,750
It's Haseo,
he's back again.

90
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:26,958
Yeah, I know.

91
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,166
Don't you wanna go see him?

92
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,125
Why would I?

93
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,500
Whaddaya mean, why?

94
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,416
I guess I can understand.

95
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,583
Well, if he logged in,

96
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,541
that means he's fine,
doesn't it?

97
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:40,500
Maintain a moderate distance.
That's one of my principles.

98
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,500
[TOHTA] Oh, so you're
a spectator by nature?

99
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,583
I don't wanna get burned

100
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,333
by getting involved with others.

101
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,625
That depends on who
those others might be.

102
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,250
[SABURO] You have a history
of getting involved

103
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,041
with the wrong people
and finding yourself

104
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,291
in sticky situations, right?

105
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,541
Well, I won't deny it.

106
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,083
Y'know, Haseo's
kinda like Chinese food.

107
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,416
What?

108
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,833
You get full just by
smelling its enticing aroma.

109
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,291
It's kinda like that.

110
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,583
But it makes you hungry,

111
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,416
and you won't get sick of,
well, looking at it.

112
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,750
So you're fine with
just smelling and looking?

113
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:12,791
Yeah.

114
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,166
It's way more fun.

115
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,291
Are you in the bathroom?

116
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,083
As long as there's
someone like you around,

117
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,958
I'm pretty sure I don't
have to worry about anything.

118
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,333
[SABURO]
Are you gonna quit again?

119
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,791
This game is only
one aspect of real life.

120
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,250
I have all these other things
I have to take care of.

121
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,500
I dunno what you're up to,

122
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,125
but I'm sure you'll
be fine, Tawaraya.

123
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,291
Leave things here to me,

124
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,416
and go do whatever
it is you need to do.

125
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,166
[TOHTA]
Uh-huh. That's my plan.

126
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,541
Danke Schön!

127
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,833
First you call up the Avatar,

128
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,708
and then you proceed
with your attack.

129
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,458
If you don't think
you can handle it,

130
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,583
withdraw your Avatar,
and I'll do it myself.

131
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,416
I've done this before, okay?

132
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,958
I know what I'm doing!

133
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,208
Whoa!

134
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,500
[KUHN]
What is this?

135
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,500
Let's go.

136
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,750
Wait a second!

137
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,833
[PI] There's something
inside the bug hole.

138
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,791
What are your orders,
Master Yata?

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,166
[YATA] I'd like to see
what comes out of it.

140
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,875
[YATA] It's imitating
an active life form?

Master Yata!

142
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,416
Your orders?!

143
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,541
[YATA]
That's enough.

144
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,625
Destroy it!

00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,666
Yes!

Don't chicken out now!
Let's go!

147
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:05,958
All right!

148
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:36,125
I really can't believe
you're dead, Phyllo.

149
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,208
I just can't accept
that you're gone.

150
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,583
Why now?

151
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,041
Forget about
getting a sample--

152
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,791
that thing was a beast.

153
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,666
For now,
let's just go back.

154
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah, for sure.

155
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,083
If that kind of thing

156
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,083
starts popping up
all over the game,

157
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,375
this world will be destroyed.

158
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:33,916
[MAN]
Are you the Haseo

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,125
that's being talked
about in the forums?

160

I've been through a lot, too.

become friends with you.

162
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,375

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,125
Well.

165
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,333
I am the Silver Knight.

166
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,958
You and I have a lot
in common, you know.

167
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,250
Maybe we'll meet again sometime.

168
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,958
I'm not interested.

169
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:01,708
[TOHTA]
That's the story.

170
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,250
So you guys just
keep playing the game

171
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,500
like you have been.

172
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,583
[PILOCCHIO] We started
an information service!

173
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,625
Are you serious?

174
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,666
[ITA]
That's right,

175
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,125
we decided to
expand our business!

176
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,666
[PILOCCHIO] We figured
we'd be better off

177
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,791
than dealing with items.

178
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,166
You know what--

179
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,375
[PILOCCHIO] So don't worry,
you go abroad and study!

180
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,666
[ITA] Come back any time
if you're lonely.

181
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,583
Nevermind that.

182
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,916
[TABBY]
There he is!

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,250
Hey, Tohta!

184
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,291
Hi! What's going on, Tabby?

185
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,416
[TABBY]
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,666
For what?

187
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,458
I feel kinda bad that
I disbanded the guild

188
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,541
that you helped me start.

189
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,791
[TOHTA]
Oh, that doesn't matter.

190
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,083
It seems like you've
settled down a bit now.

191
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,166
Mmm-hmm.

192
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,000
And about these,

193
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,666
I won't need them anymore.

194
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,041
Are you quitting?

195
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,375
[TABBY] I have a goal
in real life now.

196
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,833
As much as I'd like to take
them off your hands, Tabby,

197
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,250
the fact is, I'm quitting too.

198
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,333
[TABBY]
Meow?

199
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,166
Like you, I've
also got my real life.

200
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,166
Would you like us
to take them for you?

201
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,541
[TABBY]
Huh?

202
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,416
'Cause we'll always be here
if you want them back.

203
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,666
I'm sorry, but they're
not really for sale.

204
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,916
Don't worry, you can
trust them. It's safe.

205
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,625
They won't sell these.

206
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:10,750
[TABBY]
Really?

207
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,250
Here, yeah.

208
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,583
If I can achieve my goal,

209
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,250
then I'll come back
and get them.

210
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,750
Thanks! Come again!

211
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,375
That's my line...

212
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,791
This is it.

213
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,625
I guess I'm alone, then.

214
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,875
Any regrets?

215
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,916
Yeah, but you
can't turn back time.

216
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,791
Well, I can imagine
after all that,

217
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,250
you wouldn't have any
energy left, would you?

218
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,875
That's not it.

219
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,583
Haseo, are you lonely
being by yourself?

220
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,833
Just look around

221
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,958
and you'll see a lot
of people are that way.

222
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,583
I mean, you only
have to look at me!

223
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,666
[HASEO]
You, too?

224
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,458
You know,
before there was TV,

225
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,250
people used to
watch the fireplace

226
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,958
or gaze at candles.

227
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,833
Where do you get
this crap from, anyway?

228
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,375
[SABURO]
Human beings just require

229
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,083
plenty of visual stimulation
from things that have movement.

230
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:30,916
[HASEO]
What?

231
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,625
[SABURO]
Don't you get it?

232
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:32,958
[HASEO]
No, I don't.

233
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,291
[SABURO] There's someone
who's watching you

234
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,833
and who cares about you.

235
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,541
So why don't you go and
make your move, already?

236
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,875
What was that for?

237
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:41,833
[SABURO laughs]

238
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,291
You should know...

239
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,833
...I'm always on the move.

240
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:51,166
Hey, how would you like
to heal PCs with me?

241
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,250
[PC 26C]
Huh?

242
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,416
[SEISAKU]
In a game like this,

243
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,875
people need to be healed,
don't you think?

244
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,083
You should--

245
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,125
C'mon, quit messing around!

246
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,250
[SEISAKU]
W-Wait!

247
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,541
--[SEISAKU] But she's hot!
--[HIDEYO] I can't believe you!

248
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,833
[SEISAKU] Wait!
C'mon man, she's a babe!

249
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,083
Look at her! She's smokin'...

250
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,125
Loser.

251
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,333
[TABBY]
Haseo?

252
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,208
[TABBY]
Haseo! Haseo!

253
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,250
Haseo!

254
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,958
Welcome back!

255
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,958
[HASEO]
Hey, get off me!

256
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,000
But I'm so happy
you're back!

257
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,916
[HASEO]
You're getting on my nerves.

258
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,958
[TABBY]
It's you!

259
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,541
It really is you!

260
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,833
It's totally you!

261
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,000
Haseo!

262
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,083
[HASEO]
Hey, get off me!

263
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,250
[TABBY]
You're lying.

264
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,375
I wouldn't lie about that.

265
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,166
But why?

267
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,708
Why wouldn't he tell me,
of all people?

268
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,375
We were so close
and we always talked a lot.

269
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,416
Yeah, well,

270
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,375
it's not exactly
small talk or anything.

271
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,541
Phyllo. It's just like him.

272
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,041
You know what?

273
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,041
Oh, nevermind.

274
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,375
[HASEO]
I'm going.

275
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,708
Where to?

276
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,916
[HASEO]
I don't know. Wherever.

277
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,500
But I can't stand still.

278
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,250
Are you...

279
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,125
...gonna kill PKs again?

280
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,958
Don't worry.

281
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,208
There's absolutely no use
in doing the same thing twice.

282
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,708
[TABBY]
I see.

283
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,750
Are you gonna keep
playing the game

284
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,916
even though you're back
to where you started?

285
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,083
[HASEO]
Well, to be honest,

286
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,083
I can't think of any
other way to go on.

287
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,166
[TABBY]
Haseo.

288
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,125
[HASEO]
Uh-huh?

289
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,625
[TABBY]
Listen to me.

290
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,125
You're the one, Haseo.

291
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,500
The only one
who can save Shino.

292
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,958
No, not on my own.

293
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,583
You're right.

294
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,291
Listen.

295
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,083
I've been thinking
of becoming a nurse!

296
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,333
[HASEO]
That's great.

297
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,583
The way I see it is...

298
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,541
...I'd be much better off
helping Shino in the real world.

299
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,500
That's gonna
take years, y'know?

300
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,250
[TABBY]
Oh yeah, you're right.

301
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,291
Well until then,

302
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,375
I guess I'll be
the one saving her.

303
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,958
[TABBY]
But if you can't do it...

304
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,041
Whatever!

305
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,458
That's why you can't be messing
around by yourself anymore.

306
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,041
Look, if you
can't do it, I will.

307
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,083
What're you tryin'
to say? I'm weak?

308
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,375
I like you, Haseo.

309
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,916
I've decided.

310
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,125
I'm gonna do my best for my
sake and study really hard.

311
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,708
That's why...

312
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:56,583
That's why you need to do
your best for your sake!

313
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,625
[HASEO]
Yeah.

314
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:01,791
Of course.

315
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,208
The time has finally come.

316
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,791
What do you mean?

317
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,083
As the Raven guild,

318
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,041
as a group of players
who possess the Factor,

319
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,083
let's make contact with Haseo.

320
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,916
You can leave it to me.

321
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,250
[YATA] And we'll need
a name for these.

322
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,708
[KUHN]
A name?

323
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,833
[YATA] The characteristics
will be defined by the name.

324
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,833
So we must be careful
of what we label it.

325
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,500
Of course.

326
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,416
[YATA]
A.I.

327
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,750
[PI]
Artificial Intelligence.

328
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,750
[YATA] It seems the
unidentified phenomenon

329
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,750
is the outcome of an
uncontrolled and abnormal A.I.

330
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,500
that originated from
the realms of the Net.

331
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:54,250
Therefore, we'll
refer to it as AIDA,

332
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,416
an Artificial
Intelligence Data Anomaly.

333
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,458
[PI]
AIDA?

334
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,708
[OVAN]
Become stronger, Haseo.

335
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,708
Strong enough to kill me.

336
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,208
And if you can't
get stronger than that,

337
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,458
it will...

338
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,791
Something completely unique
that only you possess.

339
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,750
[HASEO]
I don't get it.

340
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,000
It's amazing!

341
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,083
Today's youth seem to lack
manners and morality.

342
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,750
Read the manual!

343
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,791
So tell me, are you?

344
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,291
I'll read it later.

345
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,458
I know it's hard,
but don't quit.

346
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,583
I don't know you,

347
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,833
but I don't wanna
go on with this game.

348
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:19,083
It's so stupid and pointless.

349
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,208
It's not stupid.

350
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,500
And it's not pointless.

351
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,291
Welcome, Haseo.

352
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,458
Welcome to The World.

353
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:37,208
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

354
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,250
There would be
nothing left to enjoy

355
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,000
if we knew everything.

356
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,875
I'm so sorry.

357
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,791
[HASEO]
Huh?

358
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:21,875
It's just...

359
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,333
...I have to stay strong.

360
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,208
Know what, Shino?
You are staying strong.

361
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,458
I'm not like her.

362
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:57,791
Aura lost hope for this world

363
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,000
and decided that
she had to run away.

364
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,708
[SHINO]
You know what?

365
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,750
The wonderful thing
about this place

366
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:15,083
is that it allows you
to think and feel calm.

367
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,500
I feel as though I'm at the
beginning of something.

368
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,833
Of knowing what I need to do.

369
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:25,583
This is where I
decided to change

370
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,958
my Player Character's color.

371
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,166
This is where Ovan and I decided

372
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,500
to search for the
Key of the Twilight.

373
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:41,583
And this is the place where
I first heard of you, Haseo.

374
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,416
This is where I always came

375
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,041
when I was about
to begin something new.

376
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,458
Now...

377
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,500
...it's clear!
