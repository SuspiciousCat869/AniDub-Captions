Tell me if you
know Tri-Edge.

No, never heard of
him... right guys?

Yeah.

00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,333
[PHYLLO] Isn't it a little
pointless coming here everyday?

Don't you have
anything better to do?

Whether or not coming
here is pointless...

I'll decide that.

Alright?

Hello.

Hi!

Tri-Edge!

00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,833
What about him?

00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,916
I heard he's disappeared!

He's gone?

he just vanished.

Uh... are you a beginner?

Something like that.

But I have heard
the rumors about him.

What do you think?

Maybe they--Maybe they
decided it was time

to suspend his account?

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,375
That may have
been the case

00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,416
if he in fact had
an account to begin with.

Are you leaving?

that I gotta run.

00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,625

[TABBY] I wonder what Shino
would do at a time like this.

00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,416
[YATA/NAOBI] There's
absolutely no doubt now

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,416
that he's in
possession of the Factor.

41
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,833
The real question is how
we should go about rousing it

42
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,166

May I suggest that...

44
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,416
we try shaking him up?

45
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,750
Shaking him up?

46
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,166
Yes.

47
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,583
Previously, when
I was first awakened...

48
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,916
An unimaginable truth
was suddenly thrust upon me.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,541
Terrifying and
all-encompassing...

50
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,416
I didn't want to believe it.

51
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,500
I didn't want to accept it.

52
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,500
Then...

53
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,875
Something grabbed me
and pushed me over the edge.

54
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,583
I was totally and
completely overwhelmed.

55
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,000
It was such a profound
rush of emotion.

56
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:55,875
Reason screamed at me to
control myself, but I couldn't.

What happened is
difficult to explain.

I can assure you Haseo
is very unstable right now.

All it'll take is
swaying him a little.

lose consciousness
in reality.

00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,250
Is this PC just some
crash test dummy for Haseo?

168
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,708
Huh?

169
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:02,125
I don't know what you're
planning on using this for...

170
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,000
but I'm not
giving it back to you.

171
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,083
Well not right away,
in any case.

172
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,791
You have to admit
I've done a lot for you.

173
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,041
You've got
exactly one week.

174
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,291
I'm not gonna
wait any longer.

175
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,625
She's gonna try something?

176
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,166
What could it be?

177
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,583
I just get in his way

178
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,291
and he doesn't
even want what I offer.

179
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,333
I... try to be helpful.

180
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,375
I just wish there
was something I could do.

181
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,750
How can he be like that

182
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,458
when you're trying
so hard to help?

183
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,666
Is he blind to the fact
you're so deeply concerned?

184
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,708
Well he's my friend.

185
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,416
I just don't want
to see him get hurt...

186
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,458
or something worse.

187
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,416
Shino wouldn't want that...

188
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,541
...if she were here.

189
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,375
No she wouldn't.

190
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,958
Something that can
be tested in this world.

191
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,708
What are they
trying to do?

192
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,500
Oh hey.

193
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,250
So I thought you quit

194
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,250
Says who?

195
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,916
Oh, you know...

196
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,375
Well, don't worry about it
'cuz I plan on quitting too.

197
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,791
Get outta here.

198
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,375
You're wasting my time--

199
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,916
Listen, if you're gonna quit

200
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,625
then why don't you
leave me alone and get going.

201
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,541
Things are gonna
get really interesting.

202
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,291
Switch on!

203
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,125
They're gonna try something.

204
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,291
My guess?

205
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,291
It's probably
something like this.

206
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,166
Something that can
be tested in this world...

207
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,125
Something they'd
like to try on Haseo.

208
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,791
My hunch?

209
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,791
They want to measure
his newfound strength.

210
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,791
Would you mind if we
exchange some information?

211
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,583
I'm not an informant.

212
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,875
Whatever.

213
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,125
It doesn't
really matter much.

214
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,750
You know,
there's another player

215
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,958
who fought
Tri-Edge and didn't die.

216
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,708
So then... how
did you survive?

217
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,041
It's been a while!

218
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,791
Well you look different.

219
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:14,958
What's that?

220
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:20,000
Is that the reward
for clearing the forest?

221
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,708
Tell me, what do you
know about Tri-Edge?

222
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,791
Whoa, hold on a second.

223
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:24,875
What?

224
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,750
Aren't you glad
you got my contact?

225
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,666
Seems like you
liked my little gift.

226
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,375
I have no time.

227
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,083
Being too hasty...

228
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,583
it won't bring back
the Lost Ones, Haseo.

229
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,416
Just tell me
what you know.

230
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,666
"A drowning man
catches at a straw."

231
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,833
I've always
wondered what that meant.

232
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,916
Stop messing around!

233
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,958
Just relax...
it's only a game.

234
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,250
No, you're wrong.

235
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,916
I hope this goes as planned.

236
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,833
Well you gave
her the bait...

237
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,416
because you thought
it would go well, right?

238
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,250
I feel she's
just teasing him

239
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,750
and it won't
amount to anything.

240
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,583
That's very unlike you.

241
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,125
I'm sorry.

242
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,125
Tell me now.

243
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,750
Boy, Haseo.

244
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,583
You sure have changed.

245
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,916
You used to be
straightforward.

246
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,708
What do you mean...
I am straightforward.

247
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,416
You think so?

248
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500
You've done
a 360-degree turn.

249
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,833
You're not very
straight anymore.

250
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,333
You're twisted.

251
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,458
I'm not gonna let
the others get at you before me.

252
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:00,541
You really wanna do this?

253
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,666
You want information right?

254
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,500
Yeah I do...
bring it on!

255
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,000
Tell me why.

256
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:20,916
It's for you, you know.

257
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,666
Saving your favorite snack
'til the end to enjoy it last.

258
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,791
It's kind of like that.

259
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,875
Now I can see
why you've been able

260
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,916
to fight off so
many Player Killers.

261
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,041
But now it's time
for you to show me...

262
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,958
this thing that
no one else has.

263
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,125
Is that all you've got?

264
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,833
It seems...

265
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:24,416
he needs to be
shaken up a little harder.

266
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,250
My apologies,
Master Yata.

267
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,333
That's all right.

268
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:35,083
I guess regular players
are no match for him.

269
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:38,166
We should try
setting him up

270
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,583
against that
mysterious phenomenon.

271
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,958
Yes, but I don't think

272
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,916
that will be
necessary just yet.

273
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,791
It's too risky.

274
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,666
If his PC body ends
up disappearing again,

275
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,750
it'll be quite
a hassle to locate it.

276
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,875
He has many enemies now.

277
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,541
Are you talking about Haseo?

278
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,000
Haseo is the only
thing on my mind.

279
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,416
I'm still very
worried about him.

280
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,250
He should
really give up soon.

281
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:25,416
So that's what you've
been thinking all along?

282
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,666
I certainly don't recall

283
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,291
ever disguising
my feelings from you.

284
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:34,833
Haseo!

285
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:45,458
You have a gift, Haseo.

286
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Hey.

287
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,875
What exactly...
is this gift?

288
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,375
Haseo, did somebody tell
you that you had a gift?

289
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:58,583
What is this thing
that no one else has?

290
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,416
Just relax now.

291
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,208
Can you tell me
what happened?

292
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,833
No, you tell me.

293
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,291
Where's Tri-Edge?

294
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,958
Tri-edge is gone.

295
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,083
You have to
forget about him.

296
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,541
How am I supposed
to let him go?

297
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,958
You can yell...

298
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,541
but it simply won't change
the fact that he's gone.

299
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,166
What's wrong with him?

300
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,500
Is that the guy
the rumors are about?

301
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,875
Looks like he's lost it.

302
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,291
You don't want to be messing
with that kind of wacko.

303
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,541
Hey, it's Touta!

304
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,583
What's he getting
himself into,

305
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,166
hanging around that guy?

306
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,041
[TAIHAKU] I saw the player
I met in the forest.

307
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,333
Are you talking about Haseo?

308
00:19:56,416 --> 00:20:01,958
What do you think
has changed about him?

309
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,916
I'm not the one to ask.

310
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,708
Didn't he clear
the Forest of Pain?

311
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,041
Well I may be mistaken,

312
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,083
but aren't you the one
that got the sword?

313
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,250
You had asked me before

314
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,416
whether it was worth
the trouble to get the sword.

315
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,000
And?

316
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,125
Maybe it was,
but maybe it wasn't.

317
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,333
In the end though,

318
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,708
it doesn't
really matter to me.

319
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,333
That was a quick way
to become stronger.

320
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:34,041
I believe that was the purpose
of the Forest of Pain.

321
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:37,041
But when I think about it,
maybe I was mistaken.

322
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:43,375
My uncertainty
has led me to suspect

323
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:47,791
that maybe he was the only
one that completed that event.

324
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,875
But if that was the reward
for getting through it,

325
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,416
then I'm thinking
it was best for me

326
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,791
not to have
cleared it after all.

327
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,750
You sure have changed.

328
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,291
So this is the place.

329
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,583
Well I've changed too.

330
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,333
But honestly,
you really surprised me.

331
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,791
I wasn't expecting this.

332
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,041
I want you to tell me
if you know Tri-Edge.

333
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,875
Hey, don't
get so aggressive

334
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,458
if you're gonna
ask for a favor.

335
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:51,333
I will get
the information for you.

336
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,125
Who do you think you are?

337
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,500
Listen, you're going to buy
the information from me.

338
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,083
Trust is the number one
key to doing business.

339
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,916
You have to believe in me.

340
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,125
Alright?

341
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,083
Come again.

342
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,750
Tawaraya.
