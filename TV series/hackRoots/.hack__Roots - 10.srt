1
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,333
Meow!

2
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,208
[TABBY screams]

3
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,375
[SAKISAKA]
Calm down.

4
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,750
Just pretend they're a pack of
monsters and it'll be a breeze.

5
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:37,791
Okay!

6
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,250
Save your victory
celebration for later.

7
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,750
[HASEO]
There's so many of them!

8
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:56,916
Where's Ovan?

9
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,833
[SHINO] No word.
I haven't heard anything.

10
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,333
We'll go to the
next floor and regroup.

11
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,625
We're gonna run out
of recovery items soon!

12
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,583
Just a little longer!

13
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,333
Remember, the enemies in
front of us are insignificant.

14
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,125
If Ovan finds the
Key of the Twilight,

15
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,250
then victory is
ours for sure.

16
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,250
Got it?

17
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,333
[SAKISAKA]
Exactly!

18
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,916
Even though they've
got us cornered,

19
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,958
we've got the upper hand.

20
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,291
[OVAN]
Shino.

21
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,333
It's time!

22
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,791
[OVAN]
I must go now.

23
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,541
Take care of the rest.

24
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,583
Ovan!

25
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,625
What?

26
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,125
Nothing to worry about.

27
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,791
Just a little longer!
Keep it up!

28
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,333
--Okay!
--Right!

29
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:42,166
[NAOBI]
I was waiting for you.

30
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,291
Finally, it's time
to commence phase three.

31
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,125
[OVAN]
Just as I thought.

32
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,208
This is what it's all about.

33
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,375
[NAOBI]
Oh?

34
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:56,250
You predicted this
and yet you still came?

35
00:04:56,333 --> 00:05:00,333
Or are you too proud
to admit defeat?

36
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,750
[OVAN]
I had to come.

37
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:05,416
That's why I'm here.

38
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,916
That's all there is to it.

39
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,250
[NAOBI]
That's unlike you.

40
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,583
Or is it?

41
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,583
Searching for the Key of
the Twilight at all costs

42
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:19,666
is very much like you.

43
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,000
However, never doubting
the assumption

44
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,666
that the Key of
the Twilight exists

45
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,958
is not like you at all.

46
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,916
[OVAN]
The Key of the Twilight.

47
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,458
At one time, it took the
form of a forbidden bracelet.

48
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:40,041
And yet another time,
it was the ultimate AI.

49
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:44,166
You were the one that
told me it once existed.

50
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,375
[NAOBI]
Yes. We did talk about it.

51
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,416
Not only does this
game have a realm

52
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,333
that's beyond the reach of
the system administrator,

53
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,458
but the program itself
has its own autonomy.

54
00:05:55,541 --> 00:06:00,375
It's a mysterious game that can
change its shape on its own.

55
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,916
That is "The World".

56
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,708
In it, there exists an entity

57
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,916
that is trying to
steer our universe

58
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,291
towards a better future.

59
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,708
That is the
"Key of the Twilight".

60
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,416
You also told me
it was the key

61
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,083
that will bring about
the twilight of dawn.

62
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,541
[NAOBI]
Yes.

63
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:25,208
That is also why I prepared
this scenery for you.

64
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,500
[OVAN] So, twilight is
the dimming light of dusk

65
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:32,666
and it's also the
breaking light of dawn.

66
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,833
[NAOBI chuckles]

67
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,375
[NAOBI]
Ovan, have you forgotten?

68
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:40,291
I also told you that since
the second revision of the game,

69
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,750
the Key has been lost.

70
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,041
[OVAN]
How could I forget?

71
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,416
Anyway.

72
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,083
I'm still very much inclined
to continue my search

73
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:52,208
for the supposedly mythological
Key of the Twilight.

74
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:56,000
If it had existed at one time,
it could still exist now.

75
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,208
And I will focus all
my energy into finding it.

76
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,458
[NAOBI]
Why?

77
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,791
Let's just say it's personal.

78
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,458
[OVAN]
But enough talk.

79
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,708
Why hasn't Ovan
tried to contact us yet?

80
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,750
[GORD] You're still
naïve as ever, Sakisaka!

81
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,583
What was that?

82
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,375
Honestly, has Ovan
ever been good at

83
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,916
communicating with people?

84
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,125
No, he hasn't!

85
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,541
Why are you guys so
mindlessly enthusiastic?

86
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,708
You look like you're
enjoying yourself, too!

87
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,833
[GORD]
Shino, go on upstairs.

88
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,916
We should be able to
take care of things down here.

89
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,416
[BSET]
I agree with Gord.

90
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,833
Why don't you go check on how
things are going up there?

91
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,500
[SHINO]
No, I should stay here...

92
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,833
Haseo, you have to go.

93
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,125
[SAKISAKA]
It doesn't matter who,

94
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,291
somebody has to
go check on Ovan.

95
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,541
C'mon, Haseo.

96
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,250
Please just listen
to Shino, okay?

97
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,208
But why do I have to go?

98
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,041
Because, Haseo...

99
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,166
 ...you are Ovan's future.

100
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,375
Would you just go already?

101
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,000
[NAOBI]
It's no use.

102
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,458
You can't do anything here.

103
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,791
You've determined your fate

104
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:36,750
the moment you passed
through those doors.

105
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:41,958
This is gonna be fun!

106
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,250
Boy, what a showoff.

107
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,083
He...

108
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,250
...he's so dreamy!

109
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,750
What?

110
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,708
Someone, come in and help me!

111
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,541
See, I told you he's a showoff.

112
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,166
I'll help, too!

113
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,916
[OVAN] What are you
going to do with me?

114
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,708
[NAOBI]
I'm not going to harm you.

115
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,625
I'm merely interested
in the mystery

116
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,833
behind that PC body of yours.

117
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,416
[OVAN]
What kind of nonsense is this?

118
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,791
It's just some
Player Character data.

119
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,500
[NAOBI]
Don't pretend you don't know.

120
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,583
Aren't you aware of
your PC data size?

121
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:25,833
It's enormous--bigger in
scale than a whole area.

122
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,250
From my understanding,
what you've achieved

123
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,291
simply can't be done.

124
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,791
It's impossible.

125
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:37,041
I want to know exactly what
you did to make that happen.

126
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,416
I'm going to examine
you thoroughly.

127
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,250
That has been my
intention all along.

128
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,250
[NAOBI]
There's no use in struggling.

129
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:57,583
I'm restraining your PC body to
find out what makes you tick.

130
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,083
Mission accomplished.

131
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,000
Retreat with me, slowly.

132
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,375
[HASEO]
Ovan!

133
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,750
Where'd he go?

134
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,083
Ovan.

135
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,833
[PHYLLO] I just gave
you a little push.

136
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,250
You decided on your own
to go and help the Brigade.

137
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,041
There's really
no need to thank me.

138
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,375
I know.

139
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:14,458
But I still wanted to
show you my appreciation.

140
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,583
I guess sometimes
these things happen.

141
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,083
Haven't you heard?

142
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,000
There's rumors spreading around
about the Twilight Brigade

143
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:24,333
actually finding
the Key of the Twilight.

144
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,041
I hear it all even
when I try my best not to.

145
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,500
It's kinda funny, isn't it?

146
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:32,000
In fact, we didn't
actually find the Key.

147
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,291
Then Ovan disappeared,

148
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,708
and no one's seen or
heard from him since then.

149
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:39,000
[PHYLLO] And TaN's secret
service put on a big show.

150
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,583
[BSET]
Yeah.

151
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,333
There's that, too.

152
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,083
And the fact that TaN had
secret operations all along

153
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,750
is now out in the open.

154
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,416
[PHYLLO] You know, everyone
who's playing this game

155
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,750
just wants a story that
makes some kind of sense.

156
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,125
By talking about it,

157
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:01,416
it makes them feel like
they're part of the action.

158
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,125
That's how the rumors
continue to spread.

159
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,166
That's all there is to it.

160
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,833
[BSET]
You sure keep your cool.

161
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,333
Well, when you're
as old as I am,

162
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,916
nothing really comes
as much of a surprise.

163
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,541
It all just gets boring.

164
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,833
Phyllo, I think you might
be wrong about that.

165
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,458
[PHYLLO]
Is that so?

166
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,041
Think about it.

167
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,125
If you don't move
and you're always here,

168
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,625
no surprises
will come your way.

169
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,958
You taught me the importance
of acting on your gut feelings.

170
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,875
That's why I wanted to
thank you for your help.

171
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,875
Thank you, Phyllo.

172
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,083
[SAKISAKA]
I'll ask you one more time.

173
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,333
Ovan wasn't there at all?

174
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,000
Cut it out already!

175
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,041
You saw it too, Sakisaka!

176
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,250
There was absolutely positively
no one on the top floor.

177
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,375
That wouldn't have been the case

178
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,250
if you hadn't let him go.

179
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,708
What are you talking about?

180
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,250
[SAKISAKA]
Well, it's too weird!

181
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,375
Where did Ovan go?

182
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:17,416
[SHINO]
Settle down, Sakisaka.

183
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,750
We all checked it out
just to know for certain.

184
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,875
There was no structure
that would transport anyone,

185
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,416
no scars or anomalies.

186
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,083
It's obvious that place
was a complete dead end.

187
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,833
[TABBY] It's true,
because the only way

188
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:31,416
we were able to get out
of that place was to reboot.

189
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,625
[SHINO] And I'm sure you
performed a thorough check

190
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,250
for any strange openings.

191
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,541
You know, like the ones in
the Hulle Granz Cathedral

192
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,166
where you got
trapped in the walls?

193
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,708
[TABBY]
Yeah, there weren't any. Right?

194
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:42,916
[SAKISAKA]
Yeah.

195
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,375
But still--

196
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,125
So if you think
about it logically,

197
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,333
there's absolutely no way
on earth that Ovan could

198
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,916
have moved from that place.

199
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,375
[SAKISAKA]
Unfortunately, I disagree.

200
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,625
[HASEO] Yeah, if he
would've rebooted like us,

201
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,666
he easily could've gotten
back to the town gate.

202
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,250
[TABBY]
I guess so, but why?

203
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,000
Would Ovan purposely
disappear like that?

204
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,041
[HASEO] I'd like to
ask him that myself.

205
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,916
Well...

206
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,125
...maybe Ovan wanted to
keep the Key of the Twilight

207
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,250
for himself or something...

208
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,583
I doubt it.

209
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,083
Ovan's not gonna
sell us out like that.

210
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,708
I don't think he
would do that, either.

211
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,166
Besides...

212
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,625
Yeah, but still...

213
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,708
Why the heck hasn't any one
of us heard from him yet?

214
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:30,500
[SHINO] Maybe it's not that
he isn't contacting us...

215
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:35,750
What if he wants to, but can't?

216
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,500
We have to be
a little more patient.

217
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,708
Okay?

218
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,500
Did you think I was Ovan?

219
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,208
No. You just surprised
me a little bit.

220
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,875
About Ovan,
you're friends with him

221
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,000
in the real world,
aren't you?

222
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,833
I know I really
don't have the right

223
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,416
to ask about
your relationship,

224
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,000
but have you tried
contacting him in reality?

225
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,666
It's been useless.

226
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,833
I have tried to reach him,
but I got no reply.

227
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,458
I see.

228
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,333
I'm so sorry.

229
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,416
Huh?

230
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,083
It's just...

231
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,875
I have to stay strong.

232
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,916
Know what, Shino?
You are staying strong.

233
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,500
Can I stay like this?

234
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,166
Just for a while.

235
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,541
There's a mountain
of complaints--

236
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,000
I can't handle them all.

237
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,083
You will handle
them, you idiot!

238
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,083
You're not a real man if you
can't deal with all the claims!

239
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,750
Why don't you think of it
as a personal quest

240
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,291
to prove yourself?

241
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,666
But...

242
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,583
I don't wanna hear any more
"ifs", "ands" or "buts".

243
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,750
Those are just pitiful excuses
and I've heard more than enough!

244
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,500
[PC 10B] There's someone
here who insists on seeing you.

245
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,000
You don't get it, do you?

246
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,458
[PC 10B] Someone called Shino
from the Twilight Brigade

247
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,875
has requested
a meeting with you.

248
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,500
From the Brigade?

249
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,375
Welcome!

250
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,083
What is your business with TaN?

251
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,583
I'm going to skip
the formalities

252
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:07,333
and go straight to
the reason why I'm here.

253
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:10,666
I'm asking you,
please give Ovan back.

254
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,958
I'm pretty sure I don't have
that kind of merchandise.

255
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,291
You're not looking for any
information, are you?

256
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,041
I heard you're
a character who plays

257
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:22,791
the role of a
merchant in this world.

258
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,625
Where's Ovan and what
have you done with him?

259
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,125
I wonder...

260
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,916
[SHINO]
Are you pretending not to know?

261
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,125
Or maybe they kept
you out of the loop

262
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,083
and didn't tell
you anything.

263
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,708
Alright, if you're
such a know-it-all,

264
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,208
what else do you know?

265
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,041
Ovan gave me data that
reveals all the dirty things

266
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,750
TaN's been up to.

267
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,041
For example, the fact that
you have a secret service

268
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,416
working under you.

269
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,583
And all the activities that
the system administrator

270
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,208
turns a blind eye to...

271
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,625
Believe me, I do have it.

272
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,708
[TAWARAYA]
Wait.

273
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,708
What do you mean,
"turns a blind eye"?

274
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,125
I see.

275
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,708
So you were just another
player unwittingly being used.

276
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,541
I think you should ask Naobi.

277
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,958
I know you like to make
deals, so let's make one now.

278
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,583
Guarantee the safe
return of Ovan,

279
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,083
and I promise
I won't do anything.

280
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,166
If you don't comply,
the data I have on TaN

281
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,625
will be made public
without hesitation.

282
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,291
So do we have a deal?

283
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,916
[TAWARAYA]
Well now...

284
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,916
That's not a deal.

285
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That's a threat.

286
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,041
[SHINO] Either way,
I'll only wait twelve hours.

287
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,041
Get me Naobi, now!

288
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,458
And until I say so,
stop taking orders.

289
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:46,333
And cancel all the ones
you've already taken.

290
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,916
Why are we doing that?

291
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,416
[TAWARAYA] TaN is on a special
holiday effective immediately!

292
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,416
No matter what, you have to
go and locate Naobi!

293
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,708
Okay, I get it...

294
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:55,583
Right now?

295
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:56,583
Don't ask questions

296
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,041
when you already
know the answers.

297
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,541
Get a move on, go!

298
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,416
[HASEO]
What do you want?

299
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,708
[GORD] Nothing much.
I just wanna talk.

300
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,500
If it's nothing,
then why am I here?

301
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,791
What do you think, Haseo?

302
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:15,000
Has Ovan found the
Key of the Twilight or not?

303
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,166
I guess at this point,

304
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,916
it doesn't really
matter anymore, does it?

305
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,916
Well I think it does.

306
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,416
Listen, I'm fairly
certain you never really cared

307
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,791
one way or the other if the
Key of the Twilight existed.

308
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,750
You were just happy Ovan
gave you a place in this game.

309
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,833
You've got to admit
that was the only reason

310
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,833
why you were searching for the
Key of the Twilight, wasn't it?

311
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:43,250
Why would you say
something like that?

312
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,416
You wanna know?

313
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,375
'Cause it was the same for me.

314
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,958
[HASEO] Then what was all
that "defeat Ovan" stuff?

315
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,000
Only our initiation
to the Twilight Brigade

316
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,291
was the same...

317
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,583
but our exits
will be different.

318
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,166
Still, because our
motives are similar,

319
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,541
I know what you're up to.

320
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,708
Don't go thinkin' you can
understand me so easily.

321
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,916
See ya later.

322
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,125
Say hi to Ovan for me.

323
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:21,333
[PC 10C] I heard the Brigade is
waging an all out war on TaN.

324
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,875
[PC 10D] It's the other
way around, isn't it?

325
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,583
[PC 10C] Of course,
TaN is a much bigger guild.

326
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,958
But it is the Brigade
that's waging the war.

327
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,250
[PC 10D] Maybe the
Key of the Twilight

328
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,375
gave them some
sort of advantage?

329
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:35,291
[PC 10C] They probably just
got fed up over something.

330
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,500
[ENDER] It seems the
girl from the Brigade

331
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,125
gave the administrator data

332
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:43,833
that proves that TaN has been
involved in illegal activities.

333
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,000
[NAOBI] So, that's what
Ovan was preparing.

334
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:50,541
[ENDER] Well, don't you feel
that might make things easier?

335
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,791
[NAOBI]
Why?

336
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,750
[ENDER] Because TaN
is no longer needed now.

337
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,708
[NAOBI]
That's true.

338
00:21:56,791 --> 00:22:00,041
It simplifies things
if TaN is disbanded

339
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,458
because of its activities.

340
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:06,958
[ENDER] These PC bodies will
become useless pretty soon.

341
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:10,541
[NAOBI] I never felt much of
an attachment to this character

342
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:14,750
in the first place.

343
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,291
Yeah.

344
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:21,541
[NAOBI] Well then,
I'll continue examining Ovan.
