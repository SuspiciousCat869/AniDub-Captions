1
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,458
What do you mean Haseo quit?

2
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:45,500
Well that's the rumor

3
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,750
that's been floating
around recently.

4
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,916
Do you think we should
take it seriously?

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,750
Well, don't ask me.

6
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,916
Yeah right, but you know...

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,125
we are supposed to deal
with information as well.

8
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,750
Alright, I guess
I can look into it.

9
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,791
Where's Phyllo?

10
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,750
Meow!

11
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,916
Lemme guess, your pets pulled
the cord out of the socket?

12
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,875
No.

13
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,583
They're not around anymore.

14
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:23,666
What?

15
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,083
Well where'd they go?

16
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,666
So, what's going on?

17
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,791
Um, it's about Haseo.

18
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:32,541
And what did he do this time?

19
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:36,208
There's a rumor going
around that he quit.

20
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:41,666
But I know It isn't true.

21
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,000
I just can't imagine Haseo
giving up like that.

22
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,458
So, he quit, huh?

23
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,583
Well, I guess
that's within reason.

24
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,916
Phyllo!

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,833
This is just a game.

26
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,250
If he doesn't want to play
anymore then...

27
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,666
But he...

28
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,958
Huh?

29
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,541
I'm sure Haseo will come back.

30
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:03,625
Because...

31
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:08,416
Because what? Please go on.

32
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,583
Cuz' I think he's the only one

33
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:15,458
that has a chance
at saving Shino.

34
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,541
Do you really believe that
he's the only one, Tabby?

35
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,708
No one else but
Haseo can do it.

36
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,166
Well what about you?

37
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,208
Wouldn't you want to try?

38
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,583
But I'm not...

39
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,958
It's really not a good idea
to rely on Haseo so much.

40
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:34,833
Yeah. You're right.

41
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,875
So, you saw the whole thing.

42
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,916
Yeah, I did.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,458
It was like I barely missed
getting hit by a car.

44
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:51,250
I don't think that's
an appropriate metaphor.

45
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:55,583
Actually it's a simile.

46
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,666
Why were you there anyway?

47
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,291
Coincidence.

48
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,291
C'mon now, don't you think it's
about time

49
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,750
we reveal our ace in the hole?

50
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:08,333
Okay well, the remnants of TaN
have been watching Haseo.

51
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,750
Right now, that's pretty
much all the information

52
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,791
I know for certain.

53
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:17,500
Actually you're one of the
remnants of TaN yourself,

54
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,750
am I wrong?

55
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,916
Tawaraya, the face of TaN.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,416
You are too. Secret Service.

57
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,625
Any change?

58
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,250
Unfortunately the data
on the Lost Grounds

59
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,666
is still relatively unstable.

60
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,750
I don't have any information
yet.

61
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:38,833
I have a very strong feeling

62
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,750
that something will happen now.

63
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,541
I'm almost certain.

64
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,041
At the moment our
most important task

65
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,250
is to determine what
Ovan was doing

66
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,000
at the Hulle
Granz Cathedral.

67
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes.

68
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,416
And Haseo has the key
to this equation.

69
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,916
We've seen that
he's been initialized,

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,916
so I don't know
if he'll come back.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,666
In the unlikely
event that occurs,

72
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,958
we'll look for another suitable

73
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,416
candidate... but I'm
confidant he'll return.

74
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,291
Did he become a Lost One?

75
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,750
Did who?

76
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,166
Haseo.

77
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,791
I doubt that's
what happened to him.

78
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,416
How do you know for
sure that he didn't?

79
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,291
Because he
possesses the Factor.

80
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,666
So the power of
the Factor was able

81
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,333
to prevent him from
becoming a Lost One...

82
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,625
But you're saying
he's back to level one?

83
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,916
Yeah it's probably
something like that.

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,250
I think I'm gonna go out.

85
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,916
What is it?

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,625
I can't leave you by yourself.

87
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,916
Listen, Hideo's
okay with this, right?

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,458
If you hang out with me,

89
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,208
he'll probably
get a little mad.

90
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,000
I...

91
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,416
I wanna tell you
that I like you Tabby.

92
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,583
That's why I
can't leave you alone.

93
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,291
W-What are you trying to say?

94
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,583
I got rid of my character

95
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,083
'cause I wanted to help you.

96
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,166
I did it for you Tabby.

97
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,291
Thank you.

98
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,250
That makes me really happy.

99
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,916
But...

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,958
Let's forget about Haseo.

101
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,500
Even though you've
tried so hard to help,

102
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:37,500
that guy won't
even log in now.

103
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:43,041
No, I was relying
on Haseo too much.

104
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,625
Tabby?

105
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,833
Not just him,
but on Phyllo--on everyone.

106
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:50,916
Okay, what about you?

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,041
It's really not a good idea
to rely on Haseo so much.

108
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,666
I wanna stop fooling myself

109
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,583
and always leaving
things to others.

110
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,916
First thing's first--

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,083
there's something that
I'm gonna need to do.

112
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,541
Can I give you
my answer after that?

113
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,041
If that's the case then...

114
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,125
I'll be happy to wait.

115
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,416
Take all the time you need.

116
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,458
Thank you.

117
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,583
Did I keep you waiting?

118
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,375
No, no, I just got here.

119
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:39,083
It's been awhile.

120
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,416
Yeah.

121
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,458
There's something I've been
wanting to ask you.

122
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,208
Well, there are very few
questions I can answer.

123
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,750
I've realized Haseo hasn't
logged in for a while.

124
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,583
I heard there was some
sort of confrontation

125
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,458
between him and Tri-Edge.

126
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,666
Maybe it's better if
he doesn't come back,

127
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,041
but still I am a little
worried about him...

128
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,750
There is absolutely no
doubt Haseo will come back.

129
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,208
Listen to me.

130
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,416
Ovan, you must tell me exactly

131
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,083
what it is that you
want Haseo to do.

132
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:13,083
Betrayal is
definitely a sin...

133
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,041
however...

134
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,416
Communicating with you
is certainly difficult.

135
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,166
You can't just read the lines,

136
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,416
you have to read between
the lines themselves.

137
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,375
So.

138
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,916
Tell me, what did you do?

139
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,916
No need to worry about it.

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,083
I promise to take whatever
you tell me to my grave.

141
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,458
I understand what it
means to be a Lost One.

142
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,708
But me?

143
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:56,791
Will I ever be able to
do anything to help Shino?

144
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,416
I thought you'd be here.

145
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,166
Seisaku.

146
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,125
Our new guild's ready.

147
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,000
We're calling it
the "Medic Troop."

148
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:08,958
Wow!

149
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,375
Great.

150
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,083
And Hideyo made
friends with a guy

151
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,958
called Governor
Tadashi who's gonna--

152
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:18,166
Come on Seisaku, you don't
need to report to me anymore.

153
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,583
What am I doing...

154
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,083
I guess I shouldn't talk
to my successor like that.

155
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,291
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,541
That's okay.

157
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,458
I thought Hideo would
become the guild master.

158
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,541
He said he didn't
want the responsibility,

159
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,208
and would be happy
if someone else did it.

160
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,583
And I was looking
for the option

161
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,208
of leaving
whenever I wanted.

162
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,458
Seisaku, about that...

163
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes?

164
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,041
I was...

165
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,000
Where am I?

166
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,125
I didn't think that
I'd be transported here.

167
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,750
So, it was this
thing that helped me.

168
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:20,333
Ovan! Ovan!

169
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,541
Ovan!

170
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,375
Ovan.

171
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,708
I have heard enough.

172
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,125
That is the truth.

173
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,125
Why did it happen?

174
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,416
Phyllo.

175
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,208
My problem is...

176
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,125
my problem is exactly
the same one that you have.

177
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:35,291
Hey!

178
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,375
Are you in the bathroom?

179
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,500
Well now, look who it is!

180
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,250
Did something happen to you?

181
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,750
I'm fine.

182
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,083
Well you have been acting
pretty strangely lately, y'know.

183
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,583
It's your imagination.

184
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,291
I just met someone
who saw what happened

185
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,458
to Haseo when he disappeared.

186
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:02,166
Seems like Tri-Edge got him.

187
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,958
I know.

188
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,166
That's why I was
telling him it was dangerous.

189
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,708
But there aren't any rumors
about him being a Lost One.

190
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,416
It was only his
character that was destroyed.

191
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,333
As long as he's safe in real
life, that's all that matters.

192
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:20,250
You can't play the game
if you're not alive.

193
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,708
Well, that's true.

194
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,916
But, to him
it's not just a game.

195
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,791
It's the same as real life.

196
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,333
No, actually I think that maybe
sometimes

197
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,125
it may be more
important than that to Haseo.

198
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,875
That's why you've been
worried about him too.

199
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,958
Right?

200
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Now when are you going
abroad for your studies?

201
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,916
It's not very often I'm
asked about my real life.

202
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,625
It's alright to talk about it
every once in awhile.

203
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,041
I'm not leaving for a while.

204
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:56,125
Why?

205
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,625
Because there's a favor
I need to ask of you.

206
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,208
Wow, these are some
pretty rare goods.

207
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,750
That's right.

208
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,250
I think this thing
looks really interesting!

209
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,250
Hey Kuhn!

210
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,000
I missed you so much buddy!

211
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,791
You guys got a minute?

212
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,000
To be honest, I don't
think I should ask you this,

213
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,791
but there is something
I'd like you both to do.

214
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:33,916
Alright, what is it?

215
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,250
If you're asking for a favor,

216
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,750
then I'm definitely
willing to help out.

217
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,916
It's about Haseo.

218
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,875
You're talking about that player

219
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,500
who's known as
The Terror of Death?

220
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,916
Yeah.

221
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Okay, well what about him?

222
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:53,208
I'm not sure, but I think
the next time he logs in...

223
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,000
Well, let's just say
he might be in trouble.

224
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,500
So The Terror of Death...

225
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,375
is in trouble?

226
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,333
Well sort of...

227
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,625
Anyway If you see that guy

228
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,458
I'd like you to
take care of him.

229
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:10,333
From what I hear,
he's always alone.

230
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,875
Come on, I just
can't imagine that.

231
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,583
Yeah, Yeah.

232
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,625
I mean, people are calling
him The Terror of Death!

233
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,250
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,541
I'm being called.

235
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,875
Hey no problem.

236
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,375
And we'll be sure
to talk to Haseo

237
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,583
if we come across
him in the future.

238
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,458
Thank you guys!

239
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,625
Yeah!

240
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:31,416
Don't forget, you
can always count on us!

241
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,208
I know!

242
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,083
I'm leaving it to you.

243
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,916
I'm sure I can do it.

244
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,375
But why did you choose me?

245
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,875
Is there a problem?

246
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,833
No, I'm not saying that.

247
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:52,125
It's just no easy task.

248
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,875
Look all that matters

249
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,708
is that you're aware of
the seriousness of it.

250
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,208
I wouldn't leave
this in the hands

251
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,250
of someone who
didn't understand.

252
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:07,333
I'll pass the message on.

253
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,625
Why are you taking off?

254
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,833
I actually didn't really
mean to come here.

255
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,208
You wouldn't come here
unless you had a reason.

256
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:43,500
Maybe not.

257
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,458
Even if you go to
the beach in the winter

258
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,916
on your own just for fun,

259
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,375
you'd never go to an amusement
park alone, would you?

260
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,833
What does that mean?

261
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,833
This is the place where
Haseo ceased to be himself.

262
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:58,083
Haseo is Haseo.

263
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,708
I guess I can't deny
it if you still say it's him

264
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,541
after his appearance and
disposition have changed.

265
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,000
Why are you here, Saburo?

266
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,875
I'm visiting a grave.

267
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,750
What does that mean?

268
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,083
Exactly what I said.

269
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:16,416
I think I may have met Haseo.

270
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,750
What?

271
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,750
I just couldn't believe
that Shino was a Lost One,

272
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:25,250
so I decided to check myself.

273
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:30,375
I went to look in the hospital
and I'm pretty sure I found her.

274
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,291
And what about meeting Haseo?

275
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,375
I heard a rumor about
a guy around Haseo's age

276
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,458
who visits everyday and
I think we passed by each other

277
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,875
at the nurse's station.

278
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,291
You really think it was him?

279
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,166
Yeah.

280
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,416
I see.

281
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,041
So, he thinks of Shino
not only in the game,

282
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,625
but in real life too.

283
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:55,083
You know, I wish there
was something I could do.

284
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,333
Okay, let me guess,

285
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,958
that's what you came
here to think about?

286
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:02,250
That's funny, I didn't realize
you were so analytical.

287
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,333
You're not the type to think
about everything, are you?

288
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,583
It's better just to
worry about one thing.

289
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:12,083
Just concentrate on
the most important thing.

290
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,666
If you mix that up with
a whole bunch of other stuff,

291
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,000
you'll never find
the answer, right?

292
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,750
Yeah.

293
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,583
Well, I myself
prefer to observe.

294
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:26,125
You have all sorts of
things you want to do, right?

295
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,125
I kind of have an idea
of what I'd like to become.

296
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:33,208
Then I'll keep my eye on you.

297
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:37,333
It's a deal!

298
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,000
Sorry, I'm late.

299
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,416
Did something happen?

300
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,208
There's something
we want to show you.

301
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,541
What is it?

302
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,500
The reason we feel Ovan
requires special attention.

303
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,458
We thought that showing it
might help you grasp it better.

304
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:10,833
Please, no more .

305
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,708
What's happening?

306
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,708
The data has become enormous!
I'll handle it!

307
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,916
Wait.

308
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,166
What is this?

309
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:39,833
Recover it now!

310
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,541
Yes.

311
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,208
Where did he go?

312
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,750
What is this footage?

313
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,250
What have you people
done to that player?

314
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,958
He has something special.

315
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:52,000
No, something completely
and utterly foreign.

316
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,791
Players like him can
have an enormous amount of data.

317
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,416
In other words, they're
potentially dangerous.

318
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,750
They can't be analyzed

319
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,333
so someone has to keep
them under control.

320
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:08,291
He got away.

321
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,833
But how could he?

322
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,333
Just as you saw here.

323
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,916
His method remains a mystery.

324
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:54,000
Are you Mr. Touta?

325
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:08,833
Mr. Touta... isn't it?

326
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,916
Yes I am.

327
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,083
I was asked to
come here so I did.

328
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,666
I am sorry, but--

329
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,666
I understand.

330
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,916
I uh...

331
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,791
Thank you, yes I already know.

332
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,666
Is that right?

333
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,791
Well I guess it
must be the case then.

334
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,583
Thank you again for
taking the time to meet me.

335
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,708
Take care.

336
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,916
And the game...

337
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,250
I think you can force-quit
it if you need to.

338
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,375
Oh yes.

339
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,208
I'll do that then.

340
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,541
I'm sorry to say this,

341
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:09,625
but I can't return
the feelings you have for me.

342
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,666
It made me happy...
but I can't...

343
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,458
'Cuz Haseo... he's alone.

344
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,541
I know He's doing
all that he can...

345
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:23,791
It's like when Ovan was gone;
Shino had to keep it together.

346
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,583
What do you mean?

347
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:29,291
I learned that you can't always
be depending on other people.

348
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,250
But Tabby don't you
think there are limits

349
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,958
to what someone can
do by themselves?

350
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,083
Right now, it's time for
me to figure out who I am...

351
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:41,500
on my own.

352
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,750
I'm gonna try my best!

353
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,333
You should try your best
with your new guild too, okay?

354
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,000
Bye!

355
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,958
What is this?

356
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,333
It can't be...

357
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,208
So this is it...

358
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,666
Every man for himself, huh?
