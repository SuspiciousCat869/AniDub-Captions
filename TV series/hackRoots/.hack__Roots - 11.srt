1
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,791
[PC 11A] Isn't that the guy
from the Twilight Brigade?

2
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,583
[PC 11B] He's that PC
the Brigade and TaN

3
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,416
were fighting over.

4
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,583
[PC 11C] It's amazing that they
destroyed such a huge guild.

5
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:03,541
[PC 11D] I can't believe
TaN cheated like that.

6
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,416
[PC 11E] Didn't they fall
into the Brigade's trap

7
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,083
and get exposed?

8
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,125
[PC 11F]
Yeah.

9
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,750
Hi, Haseo!

10
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,083
Isn't it amazing?

11
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,625
Haven't you heard?

12
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,791
We're really famous!

13
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:22,875
Yeah, you know what...

14
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,125
[SAKISAKA]
Shut up!

15
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,875
Hey, um...
--Huh?

16
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:39,958
Where is...

17
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,083
...you know.
I, uh...

18
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,291
Where is Shino?

19
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,625
It's weird, she hasn't
logged in yet today.

20
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,583
But when she does,
you know what?

21
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,291
I bet she's gonna be surprised
now that we're famous!

22
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,166
[TABBY]
Speak of the devil.

23
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,708
What's that?

24
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,250
[TABBY giggles]

25
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,750
Has Ovan been in
contact with you yet?

26
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,791
Not yet.

27
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,625
Don't you think this
is just a bit weird?

28
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,000
[HASEO]
Stop yelling!

29
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,041
I wasn't talking
to you, Haseo.

30
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,125
Didn't we all fight for
the Key of the Twilight,

31
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,083
and didn't we all
believe in Ovan?

32
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,500
Why did he take off
and abandon us?

33
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,250
What's the matter,
Teacher? Are you angry?

34
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,416
I just wanna know
where he went.

35
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,500
[HASEO]
Well, I'm here.

36
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,750
What is it you want?

37
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,333
I wanted to say sorry.

38
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:06,291
Jeez, something feels
wrong to hear you apologizing.

39
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,625
Yeah, y'know...

40
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,750
I guess you may be right.

41
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,458
In exactly thirty
minutes' time,

42
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,916
my account will be suspended.

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,208
So then I'm guessing they
know that you're involved?

44
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:26,541
Makes sense.
I am the face of TaN.

45
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,125
I won't run away.

46
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,583
[HASEO]
That's honorable.

47
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:36,125
Iúm not trying to be
honorable, you know.

48
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,208
You could say...

49
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,250
[HASEO]
Hm?

50
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,958
...I have something you
might call merchant's pride.

51
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,750
I take responsibility
for my dealings.

52
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,250
That's all there is to it.

53
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:54,083
I gotta admit, I learned a
pretty good lesson this time.

54
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,625
By the way,
if I were to ask you,

55
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,625
would you be able
to do me a favor?

56
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,791
Well, it depends.

57
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,750
I'm not gonna say
yes to just anything.

58
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:01,750
I think you're aware

59
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,125
of the distorted
graphic anomalies

60
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:06,083
that are unique to
the Lost Grounds, aren't you?

61
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,625
They look like triangles.

62
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,958
[HASEO]
The scars?

63
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,125
[TAWARAYA]
Yeah.

64
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,666
I've never seen a
cheat like that before.

65
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,500
[HASEO]
And?

66
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,250
Since Revision Two,

67
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,791
TaN has always been
at the leading edge

68
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,500
of any new trend
in The World,

69
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,958
and that has consistently been
the reputation of our guild.

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,500
"Signs".

71
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,916
I've given it some thought, and
that's what I'm gonna call them.

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,500
Signs?

73
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,916
[TAWARAYA]
Yeah. If someone asks you,

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,791
I'd like you
to tell them that.

75
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,875
[HASEO] You really
think someone would ask?

76
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,458
[TAWARAYA] They're like
omens or harbingers.

77
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,875
I named them with that in mind.

78
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,541
The day will come
when Signs will be

79
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,416
the topic of
conversations everywhere.

80
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,416
I guess my time is up now.

81
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,958
I understand.

82
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,291
See ya later.

83
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:05,916
But if his account
is being suspended...

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,250
...there's never
gonna be a "later".

85
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:13,750
[SAKISAKA] I wanna know if Ovan
found the Key of the Twilight.

86
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,250
Haven't you heard anything?

87
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,333
[SHINO] I can't
get in contact with him.

88
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,416
[SAKISAKA]
You have no idea

89
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,416
how tired I am
of hearing that, Shino.

90
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,291
[SHINO] There's no use
getting all worked up about it.

91
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,875
No use getting
worked up about it?

92
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,666
What if he got greedy
and took it for himself?

93
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,833
No, Sakisaka.

94
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,250
Do you really think that...

95
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:43,041
...Ovan would do
something like that?

96
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,708
Have patience.

97
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,416
But how long can we wait?

98
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,583
There's a time limit
for everything, isn't there?

99
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,125
Even with Ovan?

100
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,833
[BSET]
Hey, you.

101
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,958
[BSET]
Come with me.

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,208
You shouldn't be
so cheerful right now.

103
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,666
But why not?

104
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,666
Why not?

105
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,125
Ovan hasn't come
back yet, has he?

106
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,791
Are you telling me
you're not worried?

107
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,666
Don't you wonder where he is?

108
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,791
But Ovan's
hardly ever around.

109
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:38,375
Besides, Shino is here!

110
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,125
You have got to stop
acting like you're still

111
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,750
in junior high school.

112
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,166
You're completely wrong!

113
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,375
I'm not a junior anymore!

114
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,208
I'm a senior, silly!

115
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,000
[TABBY]
Haseo!

116
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,916
[TABBY laughing]

117
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,875
What's up?

118
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,750
I was warning her about
being way too cheerful.

119
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,250
Can you please
take her with you?

120
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,916
I didn't do anything
that deserves a warning.

121
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,500
Anyway,

122
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,916
what are the chances that Ovan
might be coming back here?

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,583
I really couldn't say.

124
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:15,458
You're probably better off
asking Shino about that.

125
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,541
It's not that easy.

126
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,791
That's why I'm
asking you instead.

127
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,750
I'm gonna go back
and ask Shino myself!

128
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,916
Hey, hey,
let go of me! Ow!

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,625
Oh...

130
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,666
You know those scar-like
graphic distortions

131
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,166
in the Lost Grounds?

132
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,666
People are starting
to call those things Signs.

133
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,041
I didn't realize
they had a name already.

134
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,166
Yeah, it only just
happened recently.

135
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,708
Just in case someone asks you,

136
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,708
I'd appreciate
if you told them that.

137
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,375
I guess I can.

138
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,541
[TABBY]
Haseo, come on, let's go.

139
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,958
Signs?

140
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,541
Some kind of symbol...

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,916
[GORD]
Now where did you go?

142
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,041
I guess it's my turn.

143
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,291
I think the moment's
come for me to move on.

144
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,125
[PHYLLO]
I see.

145
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,750
[GORD] It doesn't look like
Ovan's gonna show up again.

146
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,583
It's about time for me to quit.

147
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,166
[PHYLLO]
Oh?

148
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,208
I have to say that
since we first met,

149
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,583
you've done a lot for me.

150
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,458
I'm flattered,
but it was nothing.

151
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:50,000
Besides, how else is an
old man supposed to kill time?

152
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,625
But Phyllo,
won't you be lonely?

153
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:57,166
No, The World is
just like a playground.

154
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,458
Everyone will leave eventually.

155
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:03,416
Just like leaving
the playground at night.

156
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:09,708
Sooner or later, one by one,
everyone goes home.

157
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,833
Everyone eventually leaves, huh?

158
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,583
Do you think you're
going to be all right?

159
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,625
What do you mean?

160
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,250
I'm talking
about the real you.

161
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,916
That's the reason why
I have to quit this game.

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,166
I just can't keep running away

163
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,916
from my real life problems
here in The World.

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,416
Running away.

165
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,875
Ahhh.

166
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,791
I know the first thing
I need to do is redeem myself.

167
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,041
[PHYLLO] You know,
you can make a fresh start

168
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,916
not only on the 'net, but
in the real world, as well.

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,625
Wouldn't that be nice.

170
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,458
Teacher!

171
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,958
Where're you goin'?

172
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,333
[HASEO]
What's up with him?

173
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,708
[TABBY]
Hey there, Shino!

174
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:16,833
What happened?

175
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,916
Sakisaka just
stormed outta here.

176
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,291
He'll be okay.

177
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,916
Did something terrible happen?

178
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,250
Whatever happened,

179
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,083
it's something you guys
don't need to worry about,

180
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,625
so you really don't
have to look so serious.

181
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,291
[NAOBI]
So you're here, as usual.

182
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,833
Well anyone can find me
here easily, can't they?

183
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,875
Are you sure you want
to be wandering around

184
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,083
after what's happened
to your guild?

185
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,833
[NAOBI]
I'm not concerned.

186
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,416
[PHYLLO]
I see.

187
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,166
There are so many
rumors going around,

188
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,416
I thought you might
be a little concerned.

189
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,375
[NAOBI] Today's the
last day for this character.

190
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,250
I think I understand.

191
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,791
None of these
rumors would matter

192
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,750
as long as you leave
this character behind.

193
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,625
So, what brings you
out here today?

194
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,833
[NAOBI] I have something
to tell you, old man.

195
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,250
All right then,
let's go somewhere else.

196
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,500
[NAOBI]
Forget about Ovan.

197
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:51,125
He can't come back anymore.

198
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,166
Ovan, please...

199
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,166
I'm pretty sure Teacher

200
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,291
hasn't logged out
of the game or anything,

201
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,916
but he still doesn't seem
to have replied to me yet.

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
How are we supposed
to find him

203
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,708
when he's just
wandering around?

204
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,083
I just don't know.

205
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,458
What do you think we should do?

206
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,791
I would totally call him
if I knew his phone number.

207
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,583
But I don't actually have it.

208
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,583
Do you know it, Haseo?

209
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,916
Come on, if you don't
know Sakisaka's number,

210
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,916
why would I have it?

211
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,291
Yeah, I guess you're right.

212
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,208
[HASEO] It's probably
better if we wait at home

213
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,375
instead of wandering around.

214
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:44,583
[TABBY]
Aww!

215
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,375
What was that for?

216
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,000
t's so cute you wanna
be with Shino that much!

217
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,250
I what?

218
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,250
[TABBY] I saw that look
in your eyes earlier,

219
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,750
when you were gazing at Shino.

220
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,333
You're not being serious.

221
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,916
It's a CG you're looking at.

222
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,500
No.

223
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:04,083
I can tell you were gazing at
her fondly through your display.

224
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,291
Well, you're pretty awesome,

225
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,833
but you can't really
replace Ovan, can you?

226
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,416
What do you mean by that?

227
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,458
I mean at the moment,
you're unable to support Shino.

228
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,041
What?

229
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,583
You're trying to tell me that
you could support her yourself?

230
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:16,625
Probably...

231
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,500
...I'd say probably not.

232
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,458
[SHINO] It's very rare
to see you here, Phyllo.

233
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,458
[PHYLLO]
You haven't seen him

234
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,541
since he disappeared
from that place?

235
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:46,833
No.

236
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,416
[PHYLLO]
Has he been in contact?

237
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,875
[SHINO]
Uh-uh.

238
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,250
[PHYLLO]
I see.

239
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,416
So it's true.

240
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,750
Hold on just a second.

241
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,250
What do you mean by that?

242
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,583
Please, Phyllo.

243
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,541
You're going to have to
tell me exactly what it is

244
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,250
that you know.

245
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,750
[TABBY]
Sakisaka wasn't in town.

246
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,583
I think we should check out
the Lost Grounds.

247
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,250
[HASEO]
Or you could send him an e-mail

248
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,750
telling him to come back.

249
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,000
I mean, he is
wandering around, right?

250
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,541
[TABBY]
I told you he's not replying.

251
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,625
[HASEO]
Well just keep trying, then.

252
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,958
Oh! Hey, Bset!

253
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,208
You're a little early.

254
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,708
[BSET]
Mmm-hmm.

255
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,875
[NASUBI] The rumors say all
the Lost Grounds have them.

256
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,041
So this is one of them, huh?

257
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:51,416
[BSET]
They're called Signs.

258
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,833
[NASUBI] I wonder if
they're gonna be used

259
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:56,083
in a new event or something?

260
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,250
So. What is it you want?

261
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,625
[NASUBI]
Oh, yeah.

262
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,208
It's about Gord.

263
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,250
I understand now.

264
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,083
He had a feeling from the
beginning that it was a trap.

265
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,083
I just hope that he
isn't suffering too much.

266
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,000
Even if he's being held captive,

267
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,375
I know he's strong and I'm
certain he'll come back

268
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,583
and rejoin his friends soon.

269
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:23,250
In the meantime,
with the way things are,

270
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,166
we'll need to stick
together more than ever.

271
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,791
But I know I can't gather
the Brigade by myself.

272
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,291
So Phyllo, who was
the one that told you

273
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,208
Ovan isn't coming back?

274
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,416
It was Naobi, wasn't it?

275
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,750
[PHYLLO]
Why do you ask?

276
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,625
You met Ovan...

277
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:45,583
...before I ever did, and
you know more about him.

278
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:50,250
So I just figured that you were
acquainted with Naobi as well.

279
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,916
Maybe it's just
women's intuition.

280
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,500
It's not like I thought
you and Naobi

281
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,583
are working together
or anything like that.

282
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,791
Don't worry.

283
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,625
I just can't believe it.

284
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,125
It's as I feared.

285
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:07,333
Ovan wasn't able to find the
Key of the Twilight, was he?

286
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,875
[PHYLLO]
Well, that's the way it is.

287
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,916
I'm sorry.

288
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,375
It'll be okay.

289
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,083
At least I think so.

290
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,750
Anyway, most importantly,
I need to tell everyone

291
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,458
what's happened to Ovan, right?

292
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,125
[PHYLLO] Ovan, is it really
true that you're gone?

293
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,083
What are you two doing?

294
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:55,291
You guys aren't waiting here
for Sakisaka, are you?

295
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,625
[Actually, we were
thinking about

296
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,083
where to look for him.

297
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,125
You don't need to
worry about that anymore.

298
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,750
I'd like you both
to go home right away.

299
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,791
Why? What's up?
Did something happen?

300
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,083
I have some important
news for everyone.

301
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,458
What is it?

302
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,125
Let's just go home first
and I'll tell you there.

303
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,416
[SHINO] After examining
various reports...

304
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,791
I've come to the conclusion
that we were wrong

305
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,291
and the Key of the Twilight
does not exist.

306
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,625
Huh?

307
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,000
Are you trying to tell me
there's no such thing?

308
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,916
[SHINO] "Does not exist"
means exactly that.

309
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,250
What about Ovan?

310
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,208
He ran into
a little trouble.

311
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,291
I don't think we'll be seeing
him around here for a while.

312
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,083
Trouble or not,
it doesn't matter.

313
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,625
So regardless, there's
no way he's gonna show up

314
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,333
if there's no
Key of the Twilight.

315
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:29,000
He can't face us again
after all we've been through.

316
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:32,166
Well then, whaddaya
suggest we do now?

317
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,791
No, are you saying Ovan
isn't coming back anymore?

318
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,625
You're not saying that
we're gonna be disbanded

319
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,291
like TaN was, are you?

320
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,958
No, I'm sure that
after a while he'll return.

321
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,875
So don't worry about it.

322
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,625
Yay! We'll just
have to wait, then.

323
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:51,166
Besides, we're already used to
Ovan never being around anyway!

324
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,041
Right?

325
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,291
Are you an idiot?

326
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,500
Can't you see that
it's different this time?

327
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,041
If there's no
Key of the Twilight,

328
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,083
then there's no way
he'll show his face.

329
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,583
Just forget about it.

330
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,333
Don't say that.

331
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,708
[SHINO]
He'll be back, for sure.

332
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,208
Prove it to me!

333
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:10,375
[HASEO] There's no use
fighting about it.

334
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,750
Besides, arguing like this

335
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,458
is not gonna change
anything, is it?

336
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,583
[SAKISAKA] Excuse me,
but I'm gonna go cool off.

337
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,375
Sakisaka, wait.

338
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,666
[TABBY] I'll go
check on my teacher!

339
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,708
[SHINO]
I'm sorry.

340
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,708
Shino, there's no reason
for you to apologize.

341
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:43,166
But its my...

342
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,916
Thank you, Haseo.

343
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,750
Listen, you don't need to
thank me for anything, either.

344
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:14,666
I think I'm going to
log out for the rest of the day.

345
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,041
Teacher, wait for me!

346
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,708
[SAKISAKA groans]

347
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,083
Teacher, wait.

348
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,041
I said wait!

349
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,666
Why can't you
just leave me alone?

350
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,458
Why?

351
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,250
I just want some time
on my own so I can think.

352
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,083
But what could there be
to think about?

353
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,041
More than you could ever know.

354
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,791
Are you gonna leave, too,

355
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,875
just like Bset and Gord left
the Twilight Brigade before?

356
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:44,208
[SAKISAKA]
Huh? Of course not.

357
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,041
Okay! Let's go!

358
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,625
Why don't we head back home?

359
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,541
Let's go! Come on!

360
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,625
Enough!

361
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:59,916
Why are you always so
blindly and annoyingly cheerful?

362
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,250
Don't think it's
because I want to be!

363
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:11,333
