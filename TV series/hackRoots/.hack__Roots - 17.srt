1
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,791
Haseo!

2
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,958
[PHYLLO] How can you
possibly match Tri-Edge

3
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,500
if you can't even
begin to stand up

4
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,791
against a Harvest
Cleric's attack?

5
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,875
I'll get even stronger.

6
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,416
I'm gonna save Shino
no matter what.

7
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,166
[PI] So you don't want
to go somewhere private?

8
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,333
[PHYLLO]
There's no need for that.

9
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,583
[PI]
Why?

10
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:04,708
[PHYLLO]
Why?

11
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,916
Because I have
nothing to say to you.

12
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,083
[PHYLLO] I don't care
how many times you ask.

13
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,125
I'm not going to explain my
relationship to that girl.

14
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:21,333
[YATA] Tell me, how long
have you been sitting here?

15
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,041
You've encountered the girl.

16
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:40,250
After observing you
sitting still for some time,

17
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,250
she approached you
out of curiosity.

18
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,000
Perhaps she thought
you were a stuffed animal

19
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,000
sitting there doing nothing,

20
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,208
like a little toy
in a store window.

21
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,666
It seemed she was
enjoying this world

22
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,875
by chatting with you
while passing the time

23
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,583
waiting for someone else.

24
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,958
Isn't that right?

25
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,208
[PHYLLO]
Who gave you the right

26
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,625
to pry into other
people's memories?

27
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,291
If I'm not
entirely mistaken,

28
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,208
it was through her
that you and Ovan met.

29
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,208
But is that
all there is to it?

30
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,541
[PHYLLO] If you've
already checked me out,

31
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,416
then there's no need
for me to tell you.

32
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,041
[YATA] I want to know
the exact details

33
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,375
of your relation to Ovan.

34
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,583
[PHYLLO] There's nothing more
than what you just said--

35
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,041
I keep things simple.

36
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,208
[YATA]
Oh?

37
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,375
[PHYLLO] I'm sorry
you wasted your time.

38
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,250
Hey, where are you going?

39
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,791
[PHYLLO]
It's dinnertime.

40
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,958
Master Yata, he--

41
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,041
Don't worry about it.

42
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,583
So this is it.

43
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,416
[TABBY]
I hope Haseo is doing okay.

44
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,083
[SABURO]
Don't forget it's only a game.

45
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,958
You don't have to worry so much.

46
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,625
[TABBY]
Yeah, you're right.

47
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,916
I thought Haseo
hated official events

48
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,583
and things like that.

49
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,083
He usually tries to avoid them.

50
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,500
[SABURO]
What about you?

51
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,500
[TABBY]
Me?

52
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,958
[SABURO]
Yeah, why don't you do it?

53
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,250
[TABBY]
It's too hard for me.

54
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,250
I can't do anything.

55
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,583
[SABURO] If you think it's
too difficult, it will be.

56
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,958
Don't you agree?

57
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,666
Unless you act on your own,

58
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,416
nothing will begin.

59
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,166
[TABBY]
Maybe, but--

60
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,666
[SABURO] You know,
there have even been people

61
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,000
who are afraid of heights

62
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,625
who fall in love with
skydiving after trying it.

63
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,833
I don't care anymore.

64
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,916
I don't wanna
talk about it.

65
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,958
[ringing sound]

66
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,916
I gotta go now.

67
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,500
Yeah, whatever.

68
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,041
You'll get
cobwebs in your head

69
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,291
from moping around
like that, you know.

70
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,250
Come on!

71
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,000
It's totally unnecessary
for us to meet in this place.

72
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,083
[PI] You're involved with
other player characters

73
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,375
aside from me,
so from now on,

74
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,708
we have to move very cautiously.

75
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,541
You want me to do
something that might be risky?

76
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,625
[PI] Nothing that would
break the rules.

77
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,750
So, what am I doing next?

78
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,750
The Black Adept Rogue
from the Twilight Brigade.

79
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,041
You remember him, don't you?

80
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,750
[SABURO]
Haseo, right?

81
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,000
For your next mission,

82
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,125
I want you to follow him
into the Forest of Pain.

83
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,375
I see...

84
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,625
So that one's your
favorite snack after all.

85
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:06,125
Look, just do your job
and stick to my orders.

86
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,166
You just want me
to make contact with him?

87
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,083
I'll be giving you
additional instructions

88
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,333
once you've accomplished that.

89
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:17,750
Now I know how a Beagle feels
when he's used for hunting.

90
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:18,958
Don't you think?

91
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,750
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

92
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,458
You know the Forest of Pain?

93
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,291
It seems like a
really terrible place.

94
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,458
[PHYLLO]
Hm?

95
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,916
I heard it's full
of high-level monsters

96
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,250
that you don't see in
any of the normal areas.

97
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,583
[PHYLLO]
Mmm.

98
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,541
There's no weapons shop,
and the only items you get

99
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,791
are the ones you pick up
when the monsters drop them.

100
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,708
In other words,
you can't just go in there

101
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,708
and expect it to be
an everyday walk in the park.

102
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,250
I wonder if Haseo
went there to get stronger.

103
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,791
Well, what other
reason could there be?

104
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,750
I really hope he's okay.

105
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,333
I wouldn't worry about it.

106
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,791
If he simply went there to get
stronger and raise his level,

107
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,541
I'm sure he'll be fine.

108
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,916
But if he wants
to fight Tri-Edge,

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,625
that won't be enough.

110
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,833
Yeah, well right
now I'm wondering

111
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,375
if there is anything that
I can do to help him out.

112
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,458
Who did that?

113
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,041
Was that you?

114
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,208
What's the matter?

115
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,416
You got something
against healing spells?

116
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,583
Well don't expect
me to say thanks.

117
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,916
[SABURO] This is a Lost Ground,
so even if you clear it,

118
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,583
nothing will happen.

119
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,375
What did you say?

120
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,625
Well, that's just
one person's opinion.

121
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,583
But I don't think
I'm necessarily wrong.

122
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,416
I really think
you're wasting your time.

123
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,625
[HASEO]
I won't know unless I go.

124
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,875
[SABURO]
I guess that's true.

125
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,708
[HASEO]
Who are you?

126
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,958
[SABURO]
Saburo. Nice to meet you.

127
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,458
What, aren't you gonna
cast a stereotype on me?

128
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,833
[HASEO]
Huh?

129
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,250
[SABURO] Don't you think
my name doesn't sound girly?

130
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,083
[HASEO]
Whatever, I don't care.

131
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,708
[SABURO]
You're a good guy.

132
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,416
[HASEO]
What's that supposed to mean?

133
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,916
[SABURO] Why are
you doing this event?

134
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,166
Don't you think it's weird

135
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,708
that they haven't
revealed the final reward

136
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,833
for clearing this
Forest of Pain?

137
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,416
I think the CC Corporation
opened the event to save face,

138
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,833
because they couldn't do
anything about the Lost Grounds

139
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,583
that appeared so suddenly.

140
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,041
It doesn't seem too far-fetched.

141
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,666
After all, this game does
have a mysterious autonomy.

142
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,750
[OVAN]
That's right, Haseo.

143
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,250
It's important
to recognize this game

144
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,458
has a very mysterious autonomy.

145
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,833
Autonomy?

146
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,375
Neither the
system administrator

147
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,791
nor any other entity
can control it.

148
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,125
In fact, parts of The World
are completely governed

149
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,166
by the rules of the game itself.

150
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:16,958
'Kay, that's enough.

151
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,750
Just stop following me.

152
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,708
What an interesting kid he is.

153
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,791
[OVAN]
So you came.

154
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,625
[OVAN chuckles]

155
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:04,208
Hey you, have you
ever heard of Tri-Edge?

156
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,708
[HASEO]
Do you know something?

157
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,250
[SABURO]
No.

158
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,375
Is he really a player character?

159
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,208
I mean, rumor has it that PCs

160
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,083
destroyed by him
are lost forever.

161
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,333
[HASEO] Are you saying he's
a non-player character?

162
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,583
[SABURO]
That's impossible.

163
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,416
If he was an NPC,
then CC Corp

164
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,291
would delete him
or take countermeasures.

165
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,083
[HASEO]
Then what is he?

166
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,416
[SABURO]
An A.I.

167
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,666
[HASEO]
A.I.?

168
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,416
[SABURO]
Yeah, artificial intelligence.

169
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,750
That's why CC Corp
can't do anything.

170
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,333
[HASEO] Can't they just
erase the program?

171
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,375
Aura.

172
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,625
Have you heard of her?

173
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:38,666
Aura?

174
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,041
There used to be
a statue of a girl here,

175
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,833
but that was a
very long time ago.

176
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,541
A girl?

177
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,166
[SHINO]
Yes, Aura.

178
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,708
That is the name
they used to call her.

179
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,375
The statue in the cathedral.

180
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,875
Yeah, so?

181
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,666
[SABURO]
Half right, half wrong.

182
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,708
There's the statue,
but apparently,

183
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,083
there was once
an A.I. called Aura.

184
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,583
And they couldn't erase it?

185
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,083
[SABURO]
Probably not.

186
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,375
People wrote about it in the
forum from the old revision.

187
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:16,083
[HASEO] Does that A.I.
character still exist?

188
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,250
[SABURO]
I dunno.

189
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,666
But if there aren't
anymore rumors,

190
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,458
then it's probably gone.

191
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,500
I think Tri-Edge
appeared in place of her.

192
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,875
Like a father
begging for forgiveness

193
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,083
because his daughter
ran away from home.

194
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:32,916
[HASEO]
In place of her?

195
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,916
What for?

196
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,041
Huh...

197
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,125
I wonder.

198
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,541
I guess you're gonna
have to ask him yourself.

199
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,666
[TABBY]
Oh!

200
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,208
Hi! What's goin' on?

201
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,125
Hey, what are you up to?

202
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,083
Me? I'm not doing anything.

203
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,750
I think I'll
pass on your offer.

204
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,250
Alright, then.

205
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,333
If you change your mind,
don't hesitate to contact me.

206
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,916
[TABBY]
Hm?

207
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,958
[KUHN] Oh, well
I just started a guild

208
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,291
and I was looking
for members, and I was

209
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,083
asking him if
he wanted to join.

210
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,666
Hi, nice to meet you.

211
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,125
I'm Seisaku.

212
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,125
My name's Tabby!

213
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,291
A guild? What kind?

214
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,250
I guess it's like a
support guild for beginners.

215
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,666
Hangin' out with
you the other day

216
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,750
made me realize that's something
I'd be capable of doing.

217
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,208
A support guild
for beginners, huh?

218
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,875
[KUHN]
It's called Canard.

219
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,291
Wanna come join us?

220
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,708
[KUHN]
Are you listening?

221
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:36,750
Oh.

222
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:38,916
No, thank you.

223
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,291
Okay, well I
gotta get goin' now.

224
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,041
Something he can do, huh?

225
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,291
But is there
something I can do?

226
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,750
[HASEO]
What did you come here for?

227
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,250
Sightseeing.

228
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,291
[HASEO]
What?

229
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,708
Wait a second.

230
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,708
You're that...

231
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,750
[HASEO]
Hmm?

232
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,458
What?

233
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,875
[HASEO] You're clear if you can
get to the deepest area, right?

234
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,375
[TAIHAKU]
I haven't been there yet,

235
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,250
so I still don't know.

236
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,000
[SABURO] It's unthinkable
that you'd get a reward

237
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,375
just for reaching
the end of the forest.

238
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,041
[HASEO]
You stay out of this.

239
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,166
[TAIHAKU]
What do you think, young lady?

240
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,041
[SABURO]
There is no clearing it.

241
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,583
This event's a scam.

242
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,250
[TAIHAKU] There may be
some truth in that.

243
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,750
[HASEO]
Can you clear it or not?

244
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,000
[TAIHAKU]
You may think that you can,

245
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,583
or you may think
that you cannot.

246
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,583
But then which approach is
more interesting as a game?

247
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,125
That question is
for each of us to decide.

248
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,916
It does.

249
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,083
You must play this game

250
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,208
with the assumption
that it does exist.

251
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,666
That is why we are known
as the Twilight Brigade.

252
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,541
[TAIHAKU]
Did I say something strange?

253
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,583
[HASEO]
No.

254
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,250
Well, I'm going
to keep moving on.

255
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,541
Sure.

256
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,083
If it's possible,

257
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,458
let's meet up again
in the deepest area.

258
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,500
Yeah.

259
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,416
So why didn't you
take up Kuhn's invitation?

260
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,833
You mean my reason
for not joining Canard?

261
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,375
Yeah.

262
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,750
Mainly because
it's my impression

263
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,125
that it's not only the beginners

264
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,208
who need help finding
their way in The World.

265
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,208
What exactly do you mean?

266
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,625
I realize that in a game

267
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,291
where there are lots
of Player Killers,

268
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:17,083
it becomes very challenging
for beginners to last.

269
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,583
But from what I've seen,

270
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,750
I'd have to say it's
toughest for intermediates.

271
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:22,625
Really?

272
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,791
For example,

273
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,416
if you're equipped
with valuable weapons,

274
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,333
a PK would
target you for sure.

275
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,583
That makes sense.

276
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,208
And until they've
obtained their objective,

277
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,791
they'll continue to PK.

278
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,125
There are a lot of
players like that.

279
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,625
They always go
after a certain class.

280
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,541
The ones that really need help
are the intermediate players,

281
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,958
because they're the ones who
aren't really strong enough yet.

282
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,625
Have you decided what it is
that you want to do, Tabby?

283
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,958
I'm really not sure
what I should do.

284
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,083
In fact, I don't even
know what I can do.

285
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,041
That's not what I'm asking.

286
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,083
What is it that you
want to do for yourself?

287
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,541
I really want to save Shino.

288
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,583
And I want to be there
for Haseo, too.

289
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,875
But I'm...

290
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,125
Master Yata,
I recently made an analysis

291
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,250
on what happened
at Briona Gwydion.

292
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,125
And what exactly
did you discover?

293
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,500
I came across some
data that can't be analyzed.

294
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,916
So it's Ovan.

295
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,333
Yes, I believe it's him.

296
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,708
Anything else?

297
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,625
There's evidence that
he fought against Tri-Edge.

298
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,666
Well!

299
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,041
[PI]
A Sign?

300
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,375
When did that happen?

301
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,083
You know, I'd rather go solo.

302
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,166
But I think you're gonna
get to the deepest area first.

303
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,791
Is that why you're here?

304
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,708
Well, since there's
only one day left

305
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,708
'til this event is over,

306
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,500
and since I came
here as a sightseer,

307
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,041
I'd like to
see some action.

308
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,166
You know what they call
people like that, don't you?

309
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,208
[SABURO]
Hm?

310
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,958
Parasitic.
