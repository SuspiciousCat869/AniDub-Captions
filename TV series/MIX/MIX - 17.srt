School Baseball Championship.

00:00:33,982 --> 00:00:36,568
[NARRATOR] Finally, a top-ranked
high school is making

5
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:37,902
an appearance!

6
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:42,949
It's been 30 years since
that glorious summer.

7
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:46,119
And now, the once triumphant
Meisei baseball team

8
00:00:46,202 --> 00:00:49,622
will be making its
electrifying return.

9
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:51,541
This is the story
of two brothers,

10
00:00:51,624 --> 00:00:54,711
a pitcher and a catcher;
along with their younger sister,

11
00:00:54,794 --> 00:00:56,504
they face life's
countless adventures

12
00:00:56,588 --> 00:00:57,881
while aiming for the top.

13
00:00:57,964 --> 00:00:59,841

How do I put this?

20
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:04,758
We won't even be facing Seinan
unless we make it to the finals.

21
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:06,634
[HARUKA]
Then make it to the finals.

22
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:08,261
[SOUICHIROU]
Okay, but to do that,

23
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:11,222
we need to defeat Tousei,
a top-ranked school.

24
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:13,058
And just so you know,
they won their last game

25
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:15,727
in five innings because
of the mercy rule.

26
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,479
[HARUKA]
Then you'd better defeat them.

27
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:20,482
[SOUICHIROU] Yeah, okay,
gotcha, but think about it.

28
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:22,233
Our team has a long
list of weaknesses

29
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:24,402
when you compare us
to a top-seeded team.

30
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:25,779
There's no contest.

31
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:27,864
Look, I'm not saying you
have to win all ten games

32
00:03:27,947 --> 00:03:29,115
against them.

33
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,658
Just beat them once.

34
00:03:30,742 --> 00:03:32,285
It's not rock-paper-scissors.

35
00:03:32,369 --> 00:03:34,329
That'll be tougher
than you think.

36
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:35,538
It's a nine-inning game.

37
00:03:35,622 --> 00:03:37,165
Winning by chance is rare.

38
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:41,252
Are you the type of
person who just likes

39
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:43,713
to contradict everything
anyone says?

40
00:03:43,797 --> 00:03:45,173
Hey, take it easy.

41
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:47,384
It's the catcher's job to
observe things objectively.

42
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:48,927
I gotcha covered, 'kay?

43
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:53,473
[HARUKA] This isn't news
to me or anything,

44
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:55,934
but you and I will
never get along.

Uh... Wait a minute!

Don't you know what they say?

48
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:10,824
Opposites attract,
especially when we're talking

49
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:13,451
about romantic situations.

50
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:15,286
What do you mean, "romantic"?

[NISHIMURA]
Dang it!

54
00:04:25,338 --> 00:04:26,881
I really had my heart
set on this game

55
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:28,258
being a no-hitter.

56
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:30,385
But with that, it'll be nothing
but a reference record

57

in the end.

58
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:33,054
Stop being such a perfectionist.

greet the other team.

Yeah, but, you know.

If we end up making
it to the finals,

69
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:56,745
then there's a high
likelihood we'll play Saijyou,

70
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:58,997
and they're the team
playing in the next game.

Well, this seems to be
a lucky coincidence.

and find ourselves some seats.

Come on, isn't it obvious?

He's mad that the
manager sent Souichirou

to the game with Haruka
instead of with him.

That'd make no sense.

He sent the team member who's
best at collecting data.

Of course, but try
explaining that to him.

we can do until we try?

Look, like I said,

89
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:06,523
baseball's not the same kinda
game as rock-paper-scissors!
