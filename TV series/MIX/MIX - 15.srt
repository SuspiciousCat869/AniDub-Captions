[PUNCH barks]

4
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,866
[NARRATOR] It's been 30 years
since that glorious summer.

5
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,953
And now, the once‐triumphant
Meisei baseball team

6
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,413
will be making its
electrifying return.

7
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,458
[NARRATOR] This is the
story of two brothers,

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,377
a pitcher and a catcher.

9
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,254
Along with their younger
sister, they face

10
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,298
life's countless adventures
while aiming for the top.

11
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,553
The three share one goal:
Get to the Koshien Tournament!

12
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,038
He looks just like him.

13
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,847
[ICHIBAN] Top of the eighth.
Top of the order.

14
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,474
[DAISUKE]
Hmm..

15
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,810
[ICHIBAN] Oh! You'd
better watch this first.

[NARRATOR]
Okay, then! Previously on Mix!

17
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,820
[NARRATOR] The fight for a spot
in the summer Koshien kicked off

18
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,155
with the start of the
East Tokyo Tournament!

19
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,491
After 30 years,
Meisei High School

20
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,786
is giving their all to
return to their former glory.

21
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,246
Their first opponent
of the tournament

22
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:29,418
is Kenjo High School, and their
famed slugger, Tomohito Akai.

23
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,337
By the way, they used
to be called "Sumi Tech."

24
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,596
[TOUMA]
Hmph!

25
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,391
[NARRATOR]
It's the bottom of the eighth,

26
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,727
and, trailing Kenjo
by a single run,

27
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,521
Meisei is batting from
the top of the order.

28
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,860
[ICHIBAN] Shouldn't we be happy
they're going back to the top?

[DAISUKE]
Hmm...

30
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,487
[ICHIBAN]
Although, our first two batters

31
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,239
haven't found their timing yet.

32
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,543
[UMPIRE 13B]
Out!

33
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,671
[OOYAMA]
Hmm.

34
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,507
Right!

[sighs]

38
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,650
[ICHIBAN] Oh, man, we're up
to two outs now. Not good.

39
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,070
But Souichirou is up next,
and I know he's got this.

40
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,532
[ICHIBAN]
Surely.

41
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,121
[UMPIRE 13A]
Foul! Ball four!

42
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,625
[ICHIBAN]
And he got nothing to swing at.

43
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,503
[ICHIBAN]
So...

44
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,590
[ICHIBAN] Guess it's up
to our cleanup hitter!

45
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,386
[DAISUKE] Whaddaya think‐‐
can we trust his swing?

46
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:08,433
[ICHIBAN] Hmm. Uh, well, as a
person, sure, we can trust him,

47
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,353
I think he's a good guy‐‐
pretty sharp out there.

48
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,772
Someone you can rely on.

49
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,981
[DAISUKE]
No doubt.

50
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,318
He's saved my ass plenty
of times, that's for sure.

[ICHIBAN]
Wait? You mean in a game?

52
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,324
[DAISUKE gasps] I will not
tolerate any bad‐mouthing him.

53
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,909
[ICHIBAN] Ah, like I said,
I think he's

54
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,537
a really great player,
a very reliable guy!

with this lineup?

the lineup back when he was

00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,721
a second‐year in junior high.
Just so ya know.

Well, most of the time,
I wouldn't worry.

Hmm..

he's got that vibe.

He looks like
a real cleanup hitter.

But our pitchers are solid, too,
and the infield defense may

all be 10th graders,

And after a while,
that broke his spirit.

By the time
he got to 11th grade,

beat them in the first round.

316
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,660
That's a team resurrected.

317
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,288
Cool, cool. But why
do you look so happy?

318
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,583
[ISAMI growls]
Because it isn't as exciting

319
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,211
unless we're all there.

320
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,797
Meisei, Sumi Tech, and Seinan.

321
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,465
All of us.

322
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,383
What's the big deal?

323
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,302
[ISAMI]
You don't have to get it.

324
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,888
You just have to stay
healthy and on your game.

325
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,265
You start in five days,
don't forget it.

326
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,725
[NISHIMURA]
Roger that.

327
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,103
[ISAMI]
And until then...

328
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,065
You better not get caught
taking creepy pictures.

329
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,293
[TOUMA]
Next time, on Mix.

330
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,795
[SOUICHIROU] There's just one
thing the Meisei team lacks.

331
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,005
Can you guess what it is?

332
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,632
[TOUMA]
Come on, there's more than one.

333
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,634
I can think of two:
offense and defense.

334
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,635
[SOUICHIROU]
Not that.

335
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,928
[TOUMA]
Endurance? Concentration.

336
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:49,929
[SOUICHIROU]
Nope.

337
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,930
[TOUMA]
A manager who perseveres?

338
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:51,931
[SOUICHIROU]
No.

339
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,266
[TOUMA] Then what is it?
Intelligence? Magical powers?

340
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,310
[SOUICHIROU]
No! We're lacking girls!

341
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,270
Next time! "Full of Spirit!"

342
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:01,023
[TOUMA] But, admit it, there are
a lot of other things we lack.

343
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,274
