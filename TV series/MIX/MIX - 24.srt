Are you crazy or something?

This game is taking forever!

How much longer are these
jerks gonna let this go on?!

11
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:15,899
[NARRATOR] It's been 30 years
since that glorious summer.

12
00:01:15,982 --> 00:01:19,069
And now, the once-triumphant
Meisei baseball team

13
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:21,529
will be making its
electrifying return.

14
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:24,574
[NARRATOR] This is the
story of two brothers,

15
00:01:24,657 --> 00:01:26,451
a pitcher and a catcher.

16
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:28,286
Along with their younger
sister, they face

17
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,373
life's countless adventures
while aiming for the top.

18
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:35,794
The three share one goal:
Get to the Koshien Tournament!

19
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:17,562
[HARUKA] Who were you thinking
of putting on the mound next?

[OOYAMA]
Hmm?

21
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:21,232
Y'know, to replace Touma?

22
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:23,651
[OOYAMA]
Hmm...

23
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:26,613
[HARUKA] You'd be asking a lot,
making them step into

24
00:03:26,696 --> 00:03:28,323
this high pressure situation,

25
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:31,576
not to mention facing that
intimidating Toushu lineup.

26
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:32,994
In fact, you'd have
trouble finding anyone

27
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:35,538
in the country who'd
be willing to fill in.

28
00:03:35,622 --> 00:03:39,459
[OOYAMA] True. Whether these
guys manage to score or not,

29
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:42,087
the moment I take
Touma out of the game...

30
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,214
...this thing is
as good as over.

31
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:46,299
So, I'll ask again:
who are you going to stick

32
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:48,510
with doing the dirty work,
and the responsibility

33
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:50,720
of losing the game?

34
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:53,515
The dirty work, is it? Huh.

do it! It's impossible!

Don't sweat it, Eisuke.

00:04:30,427 --> 00:04:32,470
He was also a senior
at the time.

45
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:35,223
They all assumed they knew
how this game would end,

46
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:38,143
from the moment
that Sawaii got hurt.

47
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:40,478
No one will be surprised
if you get hit,

48
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:43,815
and no one'll blame you, either.

49
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:46,276
I can't imagine
anything less stressful.

50
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:48,778
[EISUKE]
Yeah, you're right.

00:04:48,862 --> 00:04:50,196
Huh?

52
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,907
I get it! It's the truth!

53
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:54,409
I've got nothing to worry about

54
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:56,578
because no one's
counting on me out there!

[EISUKE] That's great news!
Let's do this!

00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,044
All righty, then, Tachibana.

57
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,922
You've got ammunition
that Sawai didn't have.

of the East Tokyo Tournament.

60
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:18,183
[NARRATOR] After pitching
two straight shutouts,

61
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:20,852
Meisei's ace pitcher was
about to throw another,

62
00:05:20,935 --> 00:05:24,439
limiting his opponent to just
two hits in seven innings.

63
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:27,567
Keiichi Sawai, tenth grade.

Souichirou and Otomi's
biological father.

65
00:05:31,863 --> 00:05:33,740
[NARRATOR] Sawai was
going for the third out

66
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,367
in the seventh inning.

67
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,619
And while he was
covering first base,

68
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:39,579
he crossed paths
with the runner.

69
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,665
[NARRATOR] His pitching
hand caught a spike,

70
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:45,627
and he was rushed to
the hospital immediately.

71
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,046
The team was about ready
to throw in the towel,

72
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:51,174
when number 12 suddenly
got sent out on the mound.

73
00:05:52,592 --> 00:05:54,552
[NARRATOR] His Meisei
teammates weren't the only ones

74
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:57,764
who felt deeply disturbed
by the incident.

75
00:05:57,847 --> 00:06:00,225
The guilt of injuring
the opposing team's ace pitcher

76
00:06:00,308 --> 00:06:02,602
was weighing heavily
on all the batters.

Their fighting spirit faltered,

00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:09,150
and their
concentration suffered.

80
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:12,487
But, on the other hand,
the Meisei substitute pitcher--

81
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,573
who usually threw pitches
that begged to be hit--

82
00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:18,034
seemed a little
sharper than usual.

83
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:19,494
As a result...

84
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:23,873
[NARRATOR] Naturally, no one on
the team was more surprised

85

than the guy in the
number 12 uniform.

[NARRATOR]
In the top of the ninth,

88
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:33,925
Meisei scored a run on
an error by the opponent.

89
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:37,303
This gave number 12 the chance
to be the winning pitcher.

90
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:39,014
That set the dugout on fire,

91
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:42,100
along with the crowd, who
had assumed all was lost.

92

The opponents, who'd given up
their lead and found themselves

93
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:48,690
on the verge of defeat,
were focused solely on the game.

94
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:50,567
But uniform
number 12 had misjudged

95
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,695
the situation and was
suddenly very nervous.

96
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:56,614
His mind was consumed
with fear of giving up a hit.

102
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:16,760
It's starting to drive me crazy!

00:07:16,843 --> 00:07:19,137
I'm having a hard time

[OTOMI]
Maybe I'm imagining it,

106
00:07:25,352 --> 00:07:27,228
but his pitching seems
to have gotten even better

107
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:29,647
since we went
into extra innings.

108
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:32,317
There's no way.
That can't be right.

Yeah!

Don't get too confident,

Don't get carried away.

117

You've had help
from these guys--

118
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:52,712
swinging at balls
outside the strike zone.

119
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:54,297
That's what happens
when high-scoring teams

120
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:56,174
like this panic.

121
00:07:56,257 --> 00:07:58,385
They come close to
scoring but fail to clinch it,

122
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:00,178
and that goes on,
inning after inning,

123
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:03,348
until, finally,
we're in extra innings.

124
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:04,933
It's such an unexpected
development

125
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:09,187
for a team like Toushu that it
really disrupts their batters.

126
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,689
But...

127
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:13,024
I'm keeping that in mind and
calling pitches accordingly.

128
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:15,068
[TOUMA]
Interesting. That makes sense.

129
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:17,404
I see what's happening now.

130
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,364
I couldn't figure it out before.

131
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:22,784
Here I am, completely
exhausted, and yet...

132
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:25,620
So, you two can agree. Wow.

133
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:29,249
What? I don't always disagree
with what Souichirou has to say.

134
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:31,751
When it comes
to baseball, that is.

135
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:34,004
And you're not
wrong in this instance.

136
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:36,423
But, still... That's not all.

137
00:08:36,506 --> 00:08:38,550
There's more, right?

138
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,135
Yeah.

139
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:41,720
Come on.

140
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:44,764
It'd be dumb to flatter him now.
We're in the middle of a game.

I find no lie in that statement.

[MORI] East Tokyo Tournament
semifinals, game one.

144
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:54,065
In this matchup between
Meisei and Toushu,

145
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:57,235
both teams are still
scoreless after 12 innings.

146
00:08:57,318 --> 00:08:58,445
According to the rules,

147
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:00,447
they'll keep playing
until the 15th inning.

148
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,157
Will we have a winner by then?

149
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,869
Or will the game end in
a tie leading to a rematch.

150
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:07,162
While Toushu was up to bat,

151
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:09,748
we saw their batters
being overly aggressive,

152
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:12,834
swinging at every pitch,
even the bad ones.

153
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:14,502
Do you think this is a sign
that the Toushu lineup

154
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:15,795
is starting to panic?

Quite intriguing. Is this
the kind of pitcher that he is?

recall me pointing out

in the tenth grade--

times are you gonna say it?

Shouldn't he be sitting down

to get all the rest he can
before the next inning?

just let the guy work.

as hard as he could to me.

179
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:31,788
There were some innings
where he appeared to focus

180
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:33,623
more on control,
but even then

181

burdens on himself.

could last a full nine innings.

at peak exhaustion...

as night and day.

Hey, what's your problem?!

315
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:38,983
Do you realize how annoying you
two are being over there,

316
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,360
insulting me?!

[MAYUMI] Oh, Touma!
I didn't know you were awake.

322
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:55,685
There, you see?

323
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:57,729
That's what you
get for being so loud.

324
00:19:57,812 --> 00:19:59,481
You woke him up, Otomi.

325
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:01,066
[OTOMI]
What? I did not!

326
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:02,692
You can go back to sleep now.

327
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:04,527
We didn't save any cake for you.

328
00:20:04,611 --> 00:20:07,155
He's lying. Of course
we saved you some.

329
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:08,656
It's in the fridge
when you want it.

330
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,241
[TOUMA]
And the video?

331
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,494
[SOUICHIROU] I stopped it
for you when you nodded off.

332
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:14,746
You should really copy
it to another platform.

333
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:17,248
You're gonna ruin it by
watching it over and over.

334
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:19,000
[TOUMA]
Right.

335
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,628
Here. Hurry up
and eat it, though.

336
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:24,547
We don't have any for Dad,
so we don't want him to know.

337
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:26,049
Oh, he'll be fine.

338
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:28,343
He'll get over it, as long as
he still has some snacks

339
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:29,678
to go with his beer.

340
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:33,264
[SOUICHIROU] Dad's been
watching that tape every day

341
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:36,851
since we lost the game.
The poor guy.

342
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,521
[OTOMI] He and our dad
watch it together, I guess.

All the hopes
and disappointments

348
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:57,956
of their baseball forebears.

349
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:00,250
I think it helps them
play better, right?

350
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,461
Or at least not take it
too hard when they lose.

351
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:05,088
What do think, Sawai?

Okay, you're on, Tatsuya!

353
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:11,177

Champions once again.

are bright and sunny today!

Hey, Mayumi,
don't you think he looks

357
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:17,517
a little bit like Touma?

358
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,727
I think so!

359
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,148
[screams]
What am I gonna do?

360
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:25,525
--All is lost!
--Is something the matter, dear?

361
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:27,235
[EISUKE] Of course there's
something the matter!

362
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:30,864
The tape! The most
important tape ever broke!

363
00:21:30,947 --> 00:21:32,449
What's with all the racket?

364
00:21:32,532 --> 00:21:34,993
[EISUKE] We've got to fix it!
Or find another copy somewhere!

365
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:36,786
I was smart and copied
the contents onto

366
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,582
a DVD years ago. Dad's got
nothing to worry about.

367
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:42,584
Tell him, before
he hurts himself.

00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:46,671
[TOUMA]
Hmm?

371
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:48,757
Wasn't Otomi saying
something to you?

[TOUMA] Hmm...
Yeah, she did say something.
