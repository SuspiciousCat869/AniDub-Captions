Hmm?

[NARRATOR] It's been 30 years
since that glorious summer.

8
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,583
And now, the once-triumphant
Meisei baseball team

9
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,125
will be making its
electrifying return.

10
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,125
[NARRATOR] This is the
story of two brothers,

11
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,958
a pitcher and a catcher.

12
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,875
Along with their younger
sister, they face

13
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,875
life's countless adventures
while aiming for the top.

14

The three share one goal:
Get to the Koshien Tournament!

Oh, hi! What a nice surprise!

16
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,541
You're home early.

17
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,375
[EISUKE]
Yeah. But because I left early,

18
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,333
I saw something
I'd rather not've.

19
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,083
Dare I ask what it was?

20
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:57,125
[EISUKE] I caught a baseball
club practice game.

21
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,166
Oh. I heard all
the cheering and wondered

22
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,791
what was going on over there.

23
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,583
Makes sense they're
playing a ball game.

24
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,833
[EISUKE] Touma's throwing,
if you can believe it.

That no-good Ooyama--

he's doing this so he can
hold it over my head.

29

Now I get all that "rumors
don't do him justice" crap.

it's a way to mooch

Hey, calm down!

38
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:33,333
Judging by the crowd noise,
the game was, uh...

Ah, yeah. We're losing, bad.

40

Five to nothing in the fifth.
At this rate, it's all over.

They made it
to the quarterfinals

in last summer's Koshien!

50

And they've got this amazing
pitcher named Hiroki Mita!

51

They got totally robbed
in the spring tournament,

How's it going out there?

161
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,125
The seventh inning just ended!

162
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,250
It's not going well--
we're losing five to zero!

163
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,791
What? Wait, isn't
Touma pitching, though?

164
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,708
He gave up five runs?

165
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,208
[OTOMI] No! Since the moment
Tou went out onto the mound

166
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,000
in the third inning,
they've only gotten one

167
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,541
sad, pathetic, hit!

168
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:34,458
And they definitely haven't been
able to score another run!

169
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,000
Ah, that makes more sense.

going on out on the field?

What do you mean?

You told her that Meisei
hadn't scored at all yet,

a totally normal occurrence!

[SOUICHIROU] He doesn't have
experience playing this long,

189
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,416

to lose velocity.

[SOUICHIROU]
But thanks to all the running,

191
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,208
he's built up lower

[SOUICHIROU] It's an old
saying in baseball that,

as long as you can
maintain accuracy,

195
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,500
the ball will always be hit
to the fielder's front side.

But, of course...

00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,666
You know him.

320
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,666
Whatever you expect,
he'll do the exact opposite.

321
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,833
Well, yeah, but... I meant...

322
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,416
[OOYAMA]
Hmm...

323
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,416
[SCOREKEEPER 09A]
Manager?

324
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
[OOYAMA]
Hmm? Oh.

325
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,125
[gasps]

326
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,791
Good game, boys,
nice hustle out there.

327
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,625
[TOUMA]
What was that about?

328
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,583
His pitching was on fire
in the ninth inning.

329
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,625
[SOUICHIROU]
He was sending a message.

330
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,583
We were surprised by
his skill level already,

331
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,125
right up through
the eighth inning.

332
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,291
You think he was telling us
to give up because, no matter

333
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,958
what, we'll never be
as good as him?

334
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,500
Oh, come on, we both know

335
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,625
it wasn't anything that petty.
Not throwing heat like that.

336
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,666
[TOUMA]
Yeah, you're right.

337
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,958
[MITA]
Where's my sister?

338
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,333
She was--?

339
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,708
Oh, uh...

340
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,583
If you're looking for Arisa,
she said she was headed

341
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,583
over to the junior
high soccer field.

342
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,333
Akai's match was about to start,
and she wanted to watch.

343
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,166
Yeah, she left right
after the eighth inning.

344
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,250
[BOTH gasp]

345
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,166
[growling]
Excuse me?

346
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,583
[BOTH whimper]

347
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:13,916
Oh, ah... I...

348
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,083
I'm sorry.

349
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,583
[MITA] Hey, this Akai kid, the
one who's on the soccer team.

350
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,500
What's he like?

351
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,833
Well, he's the class
rep, so there's that.

352
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,958
And he's the team captain, too.

353
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,958
He's a great student
and nice to everyone.

354
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,083
He's popular, and pretty
much universally liked.

355
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,166
But, having said that,
he's really handsome,

356
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,125
very sociable, and virtually
faultless across the board.

357
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,375
So, to be honest, all the guys
think he's kinda boring.

358
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,208
Oh, but don't worry,

359
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,791
he's not someone you should
concern yourself with.

360
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,875
I don't think he's interested in
your little sister in the least.

361
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,125
You "don't think
he's interested"?

362
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,541
Please shut up?

363
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,083
Yeah, he may be
so perfect that it's boring,

364
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,833
but I will say he has
great taste in women.

365
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,291
You care to elaborate
on that, buddy?

366
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,750
I guess what
I'm saying is that

367
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,333
your little sister
is kind of a-- [whack]

368
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,416
--Ow, my head!
--Shut your mouth!

369
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,333
[TADASHI]
What are they fighting about?

370
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,541
[MITA]
You take that back!

371
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,875
You're lucky there's
a net between us!

372
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:09,750
[ICHIBAN]
Her personality sucks!

373
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,041
[OTOMI]
Shut your face!

374
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:14,833
All right! That was
a good game, pack it up!

375
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,416
[OTOMI] That Mita.
He kinda freaks me out!

376
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,000
He was totally ticked
off by that stupid Natsuno!

377
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,083
The dummy.

378
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,500
If the netting
hadn't been there,

379
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,333
I think that loud mouth would've
gotten himself beat up!

380
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,375
[TOUMA] Too bad Mita
didn't kick his butt.

381
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,750
If Hiroki Mita had gotten
mixed up in a fight like that,

382
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,625
he would've been forced
to quit the team,

383
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,750
which would make
the summer tournament

384
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,333
way more interesting.

385
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,500
--[OTOMI growls]
--[PUNCH barks]

386
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,333
Don't joke around like that.

387
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,125
--[TOUMA] Who's joking?
--Jerk.

388
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,083
[TOUMA]
Come on. I'm only half serious.

389
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,083
[thunk]

390
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,833
--[TOUMA] Ow!
--[PUNCH barks]

391
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,333
Of course you wouldn't
understand a guy

392
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,583
who cares about
his little sister!

393
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,208
I could say the same
thing to you for hitting

394
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,750
your loving brother over
the head with a bucket!

395
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,125
You're right.

396
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,708
My poor brother is no match
for his little sister!

397
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,375
You poor thing, are you okay?

398
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,416
Oh, just shut up!

399
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,166
[PUNCH barks]

400
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,833
Shut that dog up, too!

401
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,625
Really. Can you take
him for a walk already?

402
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,250
[OTOMI]
Fine.

403
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,750
[PUNCH howls]

404
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,333
Be safe! You two
have fun on your walk!

405
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,791
How long do you plan
on wielding that stupid bucket?

406
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,000
[OTOMI chuckles]

407
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,375
[OTOMI]
Hey, Akai!

408
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,166
Ah. Hi, Tachibana!

409
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,541
[RYOU]
Good afternoon to you as well.

410
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,625
What's up with your leg?
Did you get hurt?

411
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,875
[RYOU] Oh. I just sprained
it during the game,

412
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,875
no big deal.

413
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,458
But we still beat those
guys two to nothing.

414
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,583
So, it was worth it.
I had a goal and an assist!

415
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,791
Never mind the game.

416
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,333
I'm more concerned
about your injury!

417
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,625
Don't worry, the school
nurse took a look at it.

418
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,500
She said it isn't serious.

419
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,875
That means nothing!

420
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,083
She says that about everything

421
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,000
just so she doesn't
have to deal with it!

422
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,458
You need to go to the doctor
and get it checked out!

423
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,000
All right, all right!

424
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,875
I'll sleep on it, and if it
still hurts in the morning,

425
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,458
then I'll go have it looked at.

426
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,083
[OTOMI]
No way! We're going right now!

427
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,083
Come on. I'll push
your bike for you.

428
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,583
Uh, okay. I guess.

429
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,375
[OTOMI]
Now, then, you get on the back.

430
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,541
[RYOU] We can't both ride,
that's not safe!

431
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:24,666
I'm just gonna push it for you.
It's fine, don't worry.

432
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,375
I'm kinda heavy, though.

433
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,208
[OTOMI]
Stop fussing and get on.

434
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,000
We've gotta get
that leg looked at.

435
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,041
[RYOU]
Yes, ma'am.

436
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,375

'Bye! I'll see you later!

[RYOU]
Nice to meet you!

438

[OTOMI]
Ready? Hold on tight!

00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,875
Well, Punch.

441
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,083
At least we're covered if
you make a big poopums.

Ugh.

445
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,291
[OTOMI]
What's wrong, Haruka?

446
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,958
[HARUKA] I was thinking
of going out next Saturday,

447
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,000
but getting where I want to
go is kind of an epic journey.

448
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,500
[OTOMI]
How far away are you going?

449
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:44,166
[HARUKA] It's two hours by
train, with three transfers.

450
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,000
Then a two-hour walk
from the station.

451
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,750
Then over a mountain, through
a valley, and you're there.

452
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,458
[OTOMI]
Where in the world...?

453
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,583
Next time:
"Just a Walk."

454
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,375
I'm dying to know
where she's going!
