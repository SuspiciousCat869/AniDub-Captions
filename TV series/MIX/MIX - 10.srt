1
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,333
[NARRATOR]
The weather is perfect today!

2
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,750
[PUNCH barks]

3
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:16,166
[NARRATOR] Otomi is taking
Punch out for a walk.

4
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:24,750
[ARISA]
Oh, hey. A real-life stalker.

5
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:28,291
[NISHIMURA grunts] Uh!
Who are you calling a stalker?

6
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,000
Don't talk to me like I'm some
kind of deviant creeper!

7
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,458
Well, If the shoe fits...

8
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,541
Look, my name
is Takumi Nishimura!

9
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,541
I'm in the tenth grade
at Seinan High,

10
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,500
I'm the ace pitcher for
the baseball team, and,

11
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,791
once the summer
tournament starts,

12
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,958
the whole country's gonna
be talkin' about me!

13
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:45,000
'Kay, so how's that
explain the binoculars?

14
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,541
Uh, I'm friends
with her brothers,

15
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,458
so I'm looking out for
her like a good friend.

16
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:49,583
Uh-huh.

17
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,125
Come on, it's the truth.

18
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,041
This area's gotten kinda shady,
with the creepy guys preying

19
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,000
on young girls, even
in the daytime!

20
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,333
Hang on!

21
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:58,625
See, here comes one of
those dirty predators now!

22
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,666
[NISHIMURA]
Mm... Nah.

23
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,125
Never mind; that actually looks
like a pretty cool dude.

24
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,083
I think you need to have
your eyes examined!

25
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,208
[NISHIMURA]
Hmm?

26
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,166
[ARISA]
That guy is a notorious playboy.

27
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,708
He's known as, the "Red Smile."

28
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,958
He draws them in with
that charming, boyish grin,

29
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,708
then breaks their hearts,
leaving sadness in his wake.

30
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,666
[NISHIMURA whimpers]
What?

31
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,875
[OTOMI]
Hate to say I told you so,

32
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,625
but I told you not to
trust a single word

33
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,208
that school nurse said.

34
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,000
You did, and you were right.

35
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,625
It was a good thing we went
to the hospital when we did.

36
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:32,625
Oh, and another thing--

37
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:33,625
[NISHIMURA]
Red Smile!

38
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,541
Get away from Otomi! Hey!

39
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,458
[yells, grunts]

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,333
I know exactly what you're
after here! [growls]

41
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:44,250
Leave her alone, or you won't
like what happens next!

42
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,625
Huh?

43
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:46,875
Are you trying to be funny?

44
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,291
[ARISA]
Oh, wow!

45
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:51,708
Is it that Nishimura guy
everyone's been talking about?

46
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,750
Nobody more than Miss Tachibana.

47
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,166
She tells me that
he's the ace pitcher

48
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,791
for the Seinan High
baseball team.

49
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,916
I do what?

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,833
She goes on and on
about this guy.

51
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,375
She's been worried that all
the girls will be after him--

52
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,708
once the summer
tournament starts

53
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,375
and the whole
country takes notice.

54
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,458
It's really sweet, the way
she gets so worked up!

55
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:12,208
You are that Nishimura, right?

56
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,625
Okay?

57
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,666
Hey, Akai, let's go.

58
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,500
We wouldn't wanna interrupt
these two lovebirds.

59
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,125
C'mon! We better
give them some space.

60
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,833
Oh, I get it. She wanted
to get him away from me.

61
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,500
[NISHIMURA]
Otomi! Are you okay?

62
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,375
He didn't hurt you, did he?
Did he do anything bad?

63
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,916
Are you injured?
Emotionally scarred?

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,125
I'm fine, jeez!

65
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,083
[KOMA] Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

66
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,666
[OTOMI]
Hmm?

67
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,333
[yelps, grunts] If you so much
as touch one hair on her head,

68
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,333
I'll punch you in the face!

69
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:43,250
[ICHIBAN]
What? Otomi! What's up?

70
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,125
What's going on?
Who is that, anyway?

71
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,708
[arguing continues]

72
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,500
[NARRATOR] It's been 30 years
since that glorious summer.

73
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,583
And now, the once-triumphant
Meisei baseball team

74
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,250
will be making its
electrifying return.

75
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,041
[NARRATOR] This is the
story of two brothers,

76
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,916
a pitcher and a catcher.

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,833
Along with their younger
sister, they face

78
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,833
life's countless adventures
while aiming for the top.

79
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:09,958
The three share one goal:
Get to the Koshien Tournament!

80
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:57,833
[TOUMA groans]
Man, I am freaking starving!

81
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,333
Well, Otomi is going
to be home any minute now.

82
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,000
Just hang in there till then.

83
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,583
She said she'd make her special
Spaghetti Napolitan for you

84
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,083
when you finally got out of bed.

85
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,000
Why's it always
gotta be special?

86
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,208
I mean, jeez. Not every single
thing has to be special.

87
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,708
Normal is good enough.

88
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,750
I've never once
complained about

89
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,500
regular old spaghetti.

90
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,000
But she has to make it all fancy
and add random ingredients

91
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,166
for no reason.

92
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,875
[MAYUMI] She has
a tendency to go overboard

93
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,500
where you're concerned,
Touma, whether you ask or not.

94
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,708
--But be nice.
--[TOUMA sighs]

95
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,375
Think of it this way,
she's showing kindness

96
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,500
and compassion for you, so why
not let her do what she wants?

97
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,500
[TOUMA]
Fine.

98
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,833
[MAYUMI giggles]
I'm grateful.

99
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,250
For what?

100
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,791
If it weren't for the
influence you've had on them.

101
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,916
I'm not sure Otomi and
Souichirou would've grown

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,208
into the lovely people
they are today.

103
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,583
Yeah, right?

104
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,583
When I first met those two,
they were a couple of

105
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,375
awkward shut-ins who
almost never left the house!

106
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,500
But now they're both popular
and have so many friends

107
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,208
they don't even know
what to do with themselves!

108
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,416
You're popular, too! Just look!

109
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,958
[TOUMA]
Hmm?

110
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,000
[MAYUMI] You've been getting
cards and gifts ever since

111
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,625
that practice game
the other day.

112
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,875
Our poor mailbox.

113
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,875
Who's this stuff from?

114
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,000
[MAYUMI]
But, in any case.

115
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:12,583
I have a feeling Otomi is always
going to be your number one fan.

116
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,708
[TOUMA]
Hmm?

117
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,916
[TOUMA]
I. A. O? Who is that?

118
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,041
[gasps]

119
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,375
[OTOMI]
Hey, I'm home!

120
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,333
Good, glad you're back!

121
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,000
[TOUMA sighs]
I'd better get something to eat.

122
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,666
[NISHIMURA, KOMA, ICHIBAN]
Don't forget about us!

123
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,208
Wha--? What are
you guys doing here?

124
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,208
[OTOMI] I have no idea why,
but they insisted on

125
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,166
walking me all the way home.

126
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,375
Jeez, what is this, Momotaro?

127
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,291
[barks]

128
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,041
What the heck's going on here?

129
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,958
Well, the thing is,
the Momotaro gang

130
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,666
got here before you did.

131
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,166
Oh!

132
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,083
And it looks like you brought
the villain of the story.

133
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,500
Very funny.

134
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,416
We saw each other
at the noodle shop,

135
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,625
and he decided
to follow me home.

136
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,000
Villain?

137
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,625
What the heck did I do
to deserve a day like this?

138
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,875
How many times
do I have to tell you?!

139
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,333
I dunno, how many do you got?!

140
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,916
Jeez, do you
know anything at all?!

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,333
[NISHIMURA] You don't
understand these things!

142
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,833
--Why don't you shut up?
--Yeah, yeah, whatever, weirdo.

143
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,625
Hey, wait. Where'd Touma go?

144
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,208
[OTOMI]
I dunno.

145
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,250
[TOUMA] Maybe it's not
I-A-O, but something else.

146
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,291
Could it be One A-O?

147
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:32,500
First year. Class A. Ooyama?

148
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,166
[HARUKA]
This may be forward,

149
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,291
but when we're done with
our midterms next week.

150
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,500
I'd like us to go out on a walk.

151
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,791
If that'd be too much
of a hassle, forget it.

152
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,583
But, if you want to join me,
then tomorrow I'll say,

153
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,666
"good morning."
If you say it back to me,

154
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,791
I'll know you wanna go.

155
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,291
If you'd rather not,
then just say,

156
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,583
"Ahnokutara Sanmyaku Sanboudai."

157
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,166
That'll be our code
for "No, thanks."

158
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,125
Huh? What the--?

159
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,000
Ano-ku-ta. What now?

160
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,708
[HARUKA] P.S. At the request
of the noodle shop manager,

161
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:05,333
I've taken a part-time job at
Ramen Dragon when it's busy.

162
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,250
If you're ever in the area,
feel free stop by.

163
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:13,166
I'll throw in an extra slice of
meat for you. Haruka Ooyama.

164
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,333
[TOUMA]
Hmm...

165
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,875
Now it's all starting to
make more sense.

166
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,208
Ah... Mm!

167
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,875
[KOMA gulping]

168
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,041
[grunts]
Hey! Stop!

169
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,458
[NISHIMURA]
Wanna make me?

170
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,291
[KOMA] Can't you keep your
elbows outta my space?

171
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,458
[NISHIMURA]
I'm a pitcher!

172
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,375
I can't help it if my arms
need more room!

173
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,250
[TOUMA]
Hmm.

174
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,458
I thought I understood,
but now I'm all confused again.

175
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:42,791
[STUDENTS murmuring]

176
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,166
--[SOUICHIROU] Later.
--Bye.

177
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,541
I started studying a while back.

178
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,250
I think I'm gonna do
really well this time around.

179
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,375
[TOUMA] Anyway. This walk could
really turn into a hassle.

180
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,125
So, it'd be safer
to just decline.

181
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,291
All right. What am I
supposed to say to decline?

182
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,041
[TOUMA]
Ano...?

183
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,708
Ano... Kuta... ra...

184
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:01,750
[HARUKA]
Good morning.

185
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,958
[TOUMA]
Hmm? Oh, good morning.

186
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,625
[HARUKA giggles]

187
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,958
Uh...

188
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,375
[TOUMA] Dang it! That
response is so automatic!

189
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,833
She made it hard to say
no on purpose, didn't she?

190
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,375
[TEACHER 7A]
Five more minutes, folks.

191
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,791
[HARUKA]
I'd like us to go out on a walk.

192
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,541
[gasps]

193
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,666
[TOUMA] Don't get distracted!
Gotta focus. Focus!

194
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,791
[TEACHER 7A]
Right! Pencils down!

195
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:41,958
[TOUMA grunts]

196
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,000
[OTOMI]
So? How'd your test go?

197
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,916
[TOUMA]
All my answers were guesses,

198
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,375
so we'll see when I get it back.

199
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,500
[sighs] You say the
same thing every test.

200
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,750
[SOUICHIROU] This one
might be particularly bad.

201
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,333
--Don't get your hopes up.
--[TOUMA] Huh?

202
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,750
I couldn't help but notice

203
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:01,250
that you've had trouble
concentrating. This whole week.

204
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,000
And what makes you say that?

205
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,250
Also, it's about time.

206
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,458
Time for what?

207
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,333
[SOUICHIROU]
It's been over ten minutes.

208
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,625
You know, since you
added the hot water

209
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,000
to your instant noodles.

210
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,291
[TOUMA groans]

211
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:17,875
How is it?

212
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,500
Delicious! Thanks.

213
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,958
Hey, now that I think about it,

214
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,291
you never eat noodles at
home anymore, do you, Sou?

215
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,500
Yes, I do.
Why would you say that?

216
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,041
[TOUMA]
Hmm...

217
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,083
[HARUKA] I've taken a part-time
job at Ramen Dragon

218
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,791
when it's busy.

219
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:37,708
[TOUMA] Hmm. This could
become a problem.

220
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:42,000
But, wait. Why?
What is there to worry about?

221
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,958
I mean, it's not
like I did anything wrong.

222
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,166
And it's not like
I have any idea

223
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,666
how Sou feels about her, either.

224
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,833
Besides, we're just
going for a walk.

225
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,000
Hey. Since tomorrow's Saturday,

226
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,875
you don't have
baseball practice, right?

227
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,291
Right. They'll be working
on the field all day,

228
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,041
filling in the sunken parts.

229
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,625
[TOUMA]
Oh, yeah. A free day.

230
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,083
Our only one for a while.

231
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,333
[OTOMI]
Well, perfect.

232
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,041
Then you guys wanna go
see a movie tomorrow?

233
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,500
[grunts, coughs]

234
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,750
What is your problem, man?

235
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:16,291
[TOUMA]
Oh, crap. She just said a walk.

236
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,250
She didn't say anything about
a time or place for it yet.

237
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,666
We haven't settled the details.

238
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,250
Wait, that's perfect!

239
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,375
If I already have
plans for tomorrow.

240
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,666
[slurps]

241
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,791
Let's do that!
Going for a movie sounds fun!

242
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,000
[MAYUMI]
Hey, kids, I'm home!

243
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,625
Oh, hi, Mom.

244
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,250
Touma. There was another letter

245
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,333
in the mail for you.
A fan letter!

246
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,916
[TOUMA]
Uh. Crap. Well, this sucks.

247
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,250
I read this before I could
finalize any other plans.

248
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,458
[MAYUMI]
Otomi. Can you do me a favor?

249
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,208
Will you take this gift over
to the Idas's house tomorrow?

250
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,666
Tomorrow? Wait, what?

251
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,166
Have you forgotten already?

252
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,250
You're the one who suggested
it when we went over there

253
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,041
to visit them last week.

254
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,625
You said that you would give
their daughter flute lessons!

255
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:06,833
I swear!

256
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,583
[gasps]
Uh, guess I forgot.

257
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:10,958
[TOUMA]
Hmm?

258
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,541
Well, I guess we can
all go to a movie

259
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,291
the next time parts of the
baseball field start to sink.

260
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,750
The team really
can't afford for that

261
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,083
to keep happening,
just so you know.

262
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,291
[TOUMA]
Which would mean.

263
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,458
[TOUMA] Well then, the two of
us can still go. How 'bout it?

264
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,666
I don't wanna go with just you.

265
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,500
Okay, then.

266
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,083
[TOUMA] There's no reason
to keep it a secret from him...

267
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,916
...but there's also no reason
to tell him, either.

268
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,166
And besides.
We're just going for a walk.

269
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,041
[PUNCH barks]

270
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,791
[PUNCH barks]

271
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,833
[HARUKA giggles]

272
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,083
[NARRATOR]
The weather is perfect.

273
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,875
A great day for a trip!

274
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,208
[TOUMA]
How far is this place?

275
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,041
Just a bit farther.

276
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,458
[TOUMA] Of course.
It is just a walk, after all.

277
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,041
Hey, how much
farther are we going?

278
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,166
[HARUKA]
Relax, we're almost there!

279
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,500
[TOUMA] She keeps saying that,
but we took three trains

280
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:30,333
to get this far, and we've
been walking forever.

281
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,125
This is just a walk, isn't it?

282
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:38,791
Oh! I remember those rocks!

283
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,416
Should be just
downhill from this marker.

284
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,916
Hey! Wait for me!

285
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,750
[HARUKA]
Bingo! We finally made it!

286
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,458
We did?

287
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,333
Here, look at this.

288
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,625
[TOUMA]
Hmm?

289
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,000
[HARUKA] That's a picture
of me at three years old.

290
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,833
[HARUKA]
Ha! Finally! Mystery solved!

291
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,458
[TOUMA]
Uh? Mystery?

292
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,416
It has been bugging me forever!

293
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,875
Every time I've seen the photo.

294
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,875
See right there.

295
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,833
It's the little persimmon
on the corner of the sign.

296
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,125
Oh, yeah.

297
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,500
[HARUKA]
Isn't that weird?

298
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,791
Like, why would they put a
random persimmon there?

299
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,791
That's a good question.

300
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,916
Nothing that would
bug me, though.

301
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,291
That's the mystery.

302
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,791
So, I've been thinking.

303
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,375
Maybe there's another clue on
the sign, on the part that

304
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,958
you can't see in the picture,
'cause it's hidden behind me.

305
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,291
I've been dying to find out!

306
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,916
Now, follow me over here...

307
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,833
[HARUKA]
Ta-da! Check out this guy!

308
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,916
In Japanese, "tanuki"
also means "Take out the ta!"

309
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,250
Okay?

310
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,541
So cut the "tas" from,
"Katatataki"--the falls.

311
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,083
"Kaki."

312
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,375
Right, the Japanese
for "persimmon!"

313
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,666
So, we just solved the riddle!
Doesn't it feel great?

314
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,000
[TOUMA]
I guess?

315
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,583
It's nothing to write home
about, that's for sure.

316
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,875
[HARUKA]
Wow! So satisfying!

317
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,416
I'm so glad we came!

318
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,958
[TOUMA] I don't mean to dampen
the mood--no pun intended--

319
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,375
but It's gonna be
getting dark soon,

320
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,583
so I think we'd better
start heading back.

321
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,833
Yeah, but there's
no rush, or anything.

322
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,125
There's a bus stop
not too far from here.

323
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,375
If we hike that way,
we'll run right into it.

324
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,666
There it is. I told ya so.

325
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,583
How do you do that?

326
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,791
I can't remember anything
from when I was three.

327
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,375
I gotta say, I'm impressed.

328
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,875
Why, thank you.

329
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,875
I guess that means you don't
remember us getting into

330
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:45,916
that little fight, huh?

331
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,958
Ah, wha--? No.

332

Huh? Where's Haruka?

Well, she took
the day off, so I dunno.

337
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:18,333
She said something about
plans for a little day trip.

Hey! I'm glad to see you boys!

so I was at a bit of a loss!

I just figured Haruka
would have gotten home by now,

but she hasn't yet.

Where is she?

Well, I'm-- I'm not
quite sure, actually.

So, why are you here?

I assumed you knew.

00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,958
Wherever she went,
it was with Touma.

I'm gonna need some answers.

Right this way, Manager.

Where's the dang bus?

Good question.
It should have been here by now.

362

[TOUMA] Hmm? What's this piece
of paper on the ground?

363
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,625
[TOUMA] Huh? Are these
annoying riddle signs

364
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,416
a tradition around
here, or what?

365
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,500
I think it may have
been posted on this.

366
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:44,083
"Losing hair can mean
take away the 'Ke' in Japanese."

367
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:48,541
So, that's...
"Hotenjitsu, batesu, yatesumi."

368
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,416
That doesn't
mean anything at all!

369
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,666
This is stupid.

370
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,166
[HARUKA] Hold on.
Look there-- the drawing.

371
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,750
The writing for
"lost hair" is sloppy,

372
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:56,916
compared to the rest,

373
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,458
and "sloppy" can
mean "take out the 'te.'"

374
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,958
Ah-ha! Just take
out 'ke' and 'te!'

[TOUMA]
Huh?

376
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,416
When you take those away,
what does it mean?

377
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,875
[TOUMA] "The bus will
be out of service today."

378
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,083
Awesome!

00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,041
"Awesome"? Sure,
we solved the dumb riddle,

come until tomorrow!

of us carry a cell phone?

Perfect.

[EISUKE] A little girl
threw soda in Touma's face

So, that little
meanie was Haruka!

at his mom's funeral?

at the funeral were crying,

00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,916
but he was romping around
laughing and making

404
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,291
lots of noise.

405

Apparently, Haruka took
major offense to that.

406
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,333
Touma didn't mean any harm.

407
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,083
He didn't understand
his mom had died.

408

He was little.

409

And, also, he always
got overexcited

around big crowds.

of an oddball in that way.

the whole thing.

And she was thrilled she got
to see him once again.

00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,333
[TOUMA]
Next time, on Mix!

470
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,791
[SOUICHIROU]
An unlikely rescue.

471
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,250
Touma and Haruka are lost
on a dark mountain road,

472
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,875
when all of a sudden,
the Seinan High school bus

473
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,083
comes barreling
out of the darkness!

474
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,416
Then, the father-son Nishimura

475
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,750
interrogation team bombard
the two with questions!

476
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,916
Also, the bus is haunted
by ghosts and goblins!

477
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,541
Will our friends
make it home alive?

478
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,750
Whatever will become of them?

479
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,541
Next time, "Try Pitching."

480
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:54,375
[TOUMA]
Jeez, stop exaggerating!

481
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,583
