[NARRATOR] It's been 30 years
since that glorious summer.

2
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:47,996
And now, the once triumphant
Meisei baseball team

3
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,457
will be making its
electrifying return.

4
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,543
[NARRATOR] This is the
story of two brothers,

5
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:55,420
a pitcher and a catcher.

6
00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:57,297
Along with their younger
sister, they face

7
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,342
life's countless adventures
while aiming for the top.

8
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:04,721
The three share one goal:
Get to the Koshien Tournament!

is all over that article!

Why aren't you more upset?

19
00:03:33,787 --> 00:03:36,331
This is exactly what
I was telling you about!

20
00:03:36,414 --> 00:03:38,750
A reference record by
itself is not good enough!

21
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,127
They got that
coverage for a reason.

22
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:43,213
People love a comeback.

23
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:46,341
The public never gave them
the time of day before this.

24
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:50,011
Not that battery,
or even Meisei itself.

25
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:51,554
That's why they're so appealing.

26
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:54,933
You don't say? I get it now!

27
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:57,227
So, if I pulled the same thing,
no one would be surprised

28
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,895
because they expect
me to be that great!

29
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:00,146
[ISAMI]
Oh, yeah, sure.

30
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,356
[NISHIMURA]
Uhh...

31
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,732
[ISAMI] At this point,
there's only one person

32
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:05,485
who wouldn't surprise anyone,
and that's Hiroki Mita

33
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:06,695
of Toushu.

34
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:08,238
Throw me a bone.

35
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:09,989
You should know me
better than that.

36
00:04:10,073 --> 00:04:11,741
I'm the type of person
who performs better

37
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:13,368
with positive reinforcement.

38
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:15,161
Meaning... You want me to stroke

39
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:17,455
your ego so you can
feel better. Right?

40
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:19,165
[NISHIMURA growls]

41
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:23,294
[ISAMI] I know that feeling.
I am the same way, after all.

42
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:24,713
Point taken.

43
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:27,549
We're related, yeah, but
we're not exactly the same.

44
00:04:27,632 --> 00:04:29,426
We share some qualities.

45
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:33,013
Being similar doesn't mean we're
identical in every single way.

46
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:36,975
[ISAMI] Well... I hope so.
For your sake.

47
00:04:38,643 --> 00:04:40,103
For example...

48
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:42,772
You're way too old-school to
know how to use one of these.

49
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:44,065
[ISAMI]
Hmm?

I'm gonna use it to give Otomi
a call and congratulate her!

Heh, heh! Now, let's see...
What was her number again?

53
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:55,702
[ISAMI]
In our next life,

54
00:04:55,785 --> 00:04:58,204
I'll make sure to live
next door to you!

55
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:06,671
[ISAMI]
Then we can always be friends!

56
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:16,348
[ISAMI]
And then, 30 years pass. Huh.

57
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:19,851
[NISHIMURA]
Really? She went out?

58
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:23,229
But I thought she had the day
off 'cause of Foundation Day.

59
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:25,273
Heh. Of course I know about it.

60
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:27,525
I looked it up on the Internet!

61
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:29,402
Hm? Nah. Nah, that's
not creepy at all!

62
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:30,820
It's totally normal nowadays!

63
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:34,616
But, uh, never mind that.
Who did Otomi go out with?

64
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,577
Huh? What do you mean "that
isn't any of my business"?

65
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,996
Ha! C'mon, man! Wait, hello?

66
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,665
We might not be the same,
but we're pretty damn close.

67
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:44,167
[NISHIMURA]
Hmm?

68
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:53,885

It's a rainy Foundation Day.

[MEISEI TEAM grunting]

70
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:10,610
[OOYAMA] The schedule
getting pushed back a day

71
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:13,947
was a big help.
Especially for Touma.

72
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,865
Is that your plan
until the finals?

73
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:18,743
You're using Touma
as the only pitcher?

74
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:22,122
[OOYAMA] Well, ideally, if we
could win with the mercy rule,

75
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:25,125
it would cut down on the innings
he would need to pitch.

76
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,043
But we don't have the
offense needed on our team

77
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:29,129
to support that. It's fine.

78
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:32,465
We'll just go as far
as we can-- Huh?

You said "finals"?

we'll make it that far?

Seriously?

since I became the manager!

ahead of yourself!

I guess you have a point.

we can't rely on

She saw how committed
I was to baseball.

103

I was just following my passion.

104
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:28,188
But that led to empty bank
accounts and a neglected family.

105
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:31,024
Guess that made me
a pretty lousy father.

106

Doesn't that bother you at all?

to be bothered!

Huh?

111
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:42,869
I'm pretty sure your dream
is to take Meisei back

00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:45,705
to the Koshien again! Isn't it?

Oh. Yeah.

00:07:49,376 --> 00:07:52,545
You're right about that.
Almost forgot about the Koshien.

What's up?

a "great leader"?

I guess?

119
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:03,598
You did put in a lot of
time and effort as a coach,

120
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:05,934
but all you did was turn
a mediocre baseball team

into an ordinary one.

122

Sure, the club members
liked you and everything,

123
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:12,649
but they treated you more like
a friend instead of a coach

124
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:14,442
they actually respected.

No, I didn't.

00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:01,174
Obviously.

159
00:10:01,257 --> 00:10:03,051
[AKAI] So, why are you
wearing a jacket that says

160
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:05,887
"Toushu High School" on it?

161
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,597
[ARISA]
Oh, this?

162
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:09,516
I didn't want one of my
own jackets to get soaked

163
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,892
in the pouring rain.

164
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:14,354
That's why I borrowed
this one from my brother.

165
00:10:14,437 --> 00:10:16,606
It's your brother's?

166
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,108
Tell me again.

167
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:19,192
What?

168
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:20,902
Tell me your name.

169
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:22,487
Why do you care?

170
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,489
It's Mita.

171
00:10:24,572 --> 00:10:25,907
Mita.

172
00:10:28,284 --> 00:10:29,202
[AKAI]
Wait.

173
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:30,370
Huh?

174
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:32,956
Come inside for some tea.

175
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:37,377
Okay?

176
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:42,841
[TOUMA pants]

177
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:53,476
[TOUMA sighs] Man, the rain
started coming down

178
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,562
super hard outta nowhere!

179
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:56,771
And that's exactly
why I told you

180
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:58,732
to do your laps in the gym.

181
00:10:58,815 --> 00:11:00,900
I don't like exercising indoors.

182
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:02,652
It just doesn't feel the same.

183
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:05,071
[TOUMA gasps]

184
00:11:05,155 --> 00:11:06,531
[SOUICHIROU]
What's up?

185
00:11:06,614 --> 00:11:08,825
[TOUMA] Ah, dang it. I don't
have a change of clothes.

186
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:10,618
You've gotta be kidding me.

187
00:11:10,702 --> 00:11:12,162
All right, fine.

188
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:14,706
I'll call Otomi and have her
bring you something from home.

189
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:16,249
[phone rings]

190
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:18,585
[MAYUMI]
I'm coming, I'm coming.

191
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:19,753
Hello?

192
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,173
[SOUICHIROU]
She went out?

193
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:26,468
Mm-hmm. Okay. Got it.

194
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:29,179
She said to go get it yourself.

195
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:30,347
Aww...

196
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,598
[SOUICHIROU]
It's not a big deal.

197
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:32,891
We live across the street.

198
00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:34,976
Did Mom just say
Otomi's not home?

199
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,854
[SOUICHIROU] Yeah. Apparently,
she left in the morning.

200
00:11:39,022 --> 00:11:41,983
[TOUMA] What could she be
doing in the kind of weather?

201
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:44,110
Apparently, she's on a date.

202
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:46,613
What? But it's raining.

203
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:49,532
[SOUICHIROU]
She can still go on a date.

204
00:11:50,658 --> 00:11:52,452
[TOUMA]
But the rain's really bad.

205
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:53,995
[SOUICHIROU]
Doesn't seem to matter.

206
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:07,592
[NARRATOR]
It's a rainy Foundation Day.

207
00:12:08,802 --> 00:12:10,345
[NARRATOR]
In the afternoon.

208
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:13,640
[pins clattering]

209

[thunder rumbles]

211
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,704
[TOUMA]
Was that thunder?

212
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:38,123
Yeah. I heard it, too.

213
00:12:38,206 --> 00:12:39,541
Sounded far.

214
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:42,127
I'm goin' for it.

215
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,420
I was jogging in
the rain earlier,

216
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:45,046
so running home should be fine.

217
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,007
Do you wanna call first?

218
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,677
Nah, I'll be okay.
I have a key with me.

219
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,679
I meant, call Otomi first.

220
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:58,435
[TOUMA]
I wouldn't bother.

221
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:01,104
She might resent us if we try
to meddle in her business!

222
00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:04,399
[thunder cracks]

223
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:07,819
Whoa. Better hurry.

224
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:08,945
[pins crashing]

225
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:13,366
[RYOU growls]

226
00:13:16,911 --> 00:13:19,664
Yikes. That's rough.

227
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:20,999
Tch!

228
00:13:21,082 --> 00:13:22,542
Stop it with that grumpy face!

229
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,712
It's supposed to be fun!
So, just try to relax!

230
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:29,549
I am not grumpy.
That's just how my face is.

231
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:33,094
[ICHIBAN]
Huh?! A seven-ten split!

232
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:34,429
Hmm!

233
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:37,724
[chuckles]

234
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:40,935
Here ya go! I got you a drink!

235
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:42,437
Oh? Thank you.

236
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,231
Hurry and bowl your
second ball already!

237
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,485
[RYOU]
Hmph!

238
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:49,986
[ICHIBAN] That's a good
representation of the distance

239
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,571
between you and Otomi.

240
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:54,574
You can try as hard as you want,
but it's never gonna work out!

241
00:13:54,657 --> 00:13:56,034
[laughs]

242
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,668
Uh!

243
00:14:06,252 --> 00:14:08,046
[gasps]

244
00:14:09,923 --> 00:14:11,424
So close!

245
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:14,052
Way too close!

246
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:15,637
[growls]

247
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,598
[ICHIBAN]
All righty! It's my turn!

248
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:21,267
Watch closely!
This one's for you!

249
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:23,311
Yeah. Sure.

250
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:24,729
[RYOU]
What does he think he's doing?

251
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:26,898
[ICHIBAN]
Let's do this!

252
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:29,150
[NARRATOR]
Kids, do not do what he's doing.

253
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:30,944
I'm glad I was able
to get his call before

254
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:32,696
I left home today.

255
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:34,948
He asked me if I was planning
to meet up with you later,

256
00:14:35,031 --> 00:14:38,660
so I told him I was!
That's why he tagged along!

257
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:40,787
Why'd you have
to tell him about this?

258
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,914
It was supposed to be our date!

259
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:44,416
Uh... Our wha...?

260
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:45,959
--[pins clatter]
--[BOTH gasp]

261
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:49,337
All right!

262
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:52,340
[RYOU gasps]

263
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,010
Come on. Didn't you say
you wanted to go bowling?

264
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:56,636
I thought you meant
you wanted to go out

265
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,888
and get some exercise together.

266
00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:00,348
So, I figured if
that was the case,

267
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,975
the more the merrier, right?

268
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:03,685
[pins clatter]

269
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,522
Yeah!

270
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:08,565
Yay!

271
00:15:08,648 --> 00:15:10,025
But, you...

272
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:12,360
It took a lot for me
to ask you out.

273
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,988
I was scared you'd say no,
but I finally worked up

274
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:16,740
the courage to do it.

275
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:20,118
[ICHIBAN laughs]

276
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:21,870
Never underestimate
the instincts of

277
00:15:21,953 --> 00:15:23,538
a pitcher like myself!

278
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:25,498
I'm always gonna be
one move ahead of you,

279
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:27,042
so you better step it up!

280
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,877
The way I see it,
you're light-years away

281
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,129
from outwitting someone
as clever as me!

282
00:15:31,212 --> 00:15:32,589
But I can let you try.

283
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:34,507
Hurry and bowl your second ball.

284
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:35,800
We're waiting.

285
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:38,595
[ICHIBAN growls]
I already did.

286
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:42,640
[RYOU]
You left so many pins standing.

287
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:44,601
I'm the type of pitcher
who mixes things up

288
00:15:44,684 --> 00:15:46,186
and throws to the corners.

289
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:47,312
Throwing it straight
down the middle

290
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:49,105
is just too boring for me.

291
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:52,025
I'm not a normal pitcher, so
don't lump me in with them.

292
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:55,612
[OTOMI] Well, if that's how you
wanna play, then be my guest.

293
00:15:55,695 --> 00:15:57,614
But I hope you haven't forgotten
that the one who scores

294
00:15:57,697 --> 00:15:59,657
the lowest pays for
the games we bowl.

295
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,368
That's what we all agreed upon.

296
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:04,371
[laughs]
I didn't forget!

297
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:05,872
No way!

298
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:07,499
I'm playing with
a handicap of 20,

299
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:09,584
so it's a little
different for me.

300
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,836
But while you've been
busy aiming for the corners,

301
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,589
Akai's been catching up
to you bit by bit.

302
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,674
Watch out.

303
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:17,550
Huh?! No way!

304
00:16:27,143 --> 00:16:29,104
[ICHIBAN] So, if I scored this,
he would have to score that,

305
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:34,067
--and I'd still win...
--Sorry. I was insensitive.

306
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,111
I'll be more careful.

307
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:37,362
What?

308
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:48,998
So close!

309
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:00,176
I understand that you
wouldn't hurt me intentionally,

310
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,388
and I don't want you to feel
like you're being insensitive.

311
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:04,764
So don't worry.

312
00:17:04,848 --> 00:17:07,434
There is no need to apologize
to an idiot like me.

313
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:09,144
This is all my fault.

314
00:17:09,227 --> 00:17:12,731
I jumped to my own conclusions
and I'll do better next time.

315
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:14,399
Sure, but, uh...

316
00:17:14,482 --> 00:17:17,569
An average girl would've
picked up on that kinda stuff.

317
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:19,279
I think.

318
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:21,156
[RYOU] I don't think
you're an average girl.

[OTOMI gasps]

322
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,251
So this is probably
the part where an average girl

323
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:36,254
would fall for you. I think.

324
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:38,673
[ICHIBAN]
Okay, I figured it out!

325
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,801
The only way for me to lose
now is if I throw gutters,

326
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:44,387
and Akai finishes the final
frame with two strikes,

327
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:45,972
but that won't happen.

328

Wow, that's impressive!

00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:48,975
You calculated that
all in your head?

330
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:50,310
Naturally.

331
00:17:50,393 --> 00:17:53,146
[OTOMI] Okay, then!

332

00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:03,114
between me and Otomi.

Okay! Get ready, Akai!

at the batting cages!

[BOWLING CLERKS, OTOMI]
Huh...?

354
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:51,996
[TOUMA]
Interesting. Let's see...

355
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,457
Otomi got a call from
Akai a little bit after 9

356
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,751
and he invited her
out to go bowling.

357
00:18:56,835 --> 00:19:00,088
Then, after she was ready to go,
it was around 10:30.

358
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:04,050
That's right! Those times
all sound correct to me!

359
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:05,468
And how did she react to that?

360
00:19:05,552 --> 00:19:06,636
[MAYUMI]
Huh?

361
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:10,724
A. She seemed happy about it.

362
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:13,727
B. She looked like
she was unwilling.

363
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,520
C. She got so excited,

364
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:17,397
she was skipping
straight out the door.

365
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:24,571
[MAYUMI]
Hmm... "A," I guess?

366
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:27,282
But she only mentioned that
she was going bowling, right?

367
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:29,993
And she didn't say anything
about it being a date?

368
00:19:30,076 --> 00:19:31,161
[MAYUMI]
That's right.

369
00:19:31,244 --> 00:19:34,289
But still! A date's a date!

370
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:35,790
I wouldn't say that.

371
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,043
It all depends on how
she interprets it.

372
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:41,046
If she doesn't realize it's
a date, then it isn't one.

373
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:43,715
So. To figure out
what she thought, was she--

374
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:46,551
A. Wearing something
kinda fancy.

375
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:48,928
B. Dressed normal.

376
00:19:49,012 --> 00:19:51,431
C. Wearing a jersey.

what she normally wears.

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,941
That's great.

381
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:03,401
It was raining,
so I think her outfit

382
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:05,487
was appropriate.

383
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,906
Yeah, that's a good point.

Oh! I almost
forgot to mention that

386
00:20:12,118 --> 00:20:13,870
she got another phone call
the moment before

387

she went out the door.

It's the boy who's also
in Otomi's class.
