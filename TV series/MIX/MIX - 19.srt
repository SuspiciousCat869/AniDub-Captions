How do you explain this?

00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:40,488
Every single one
of my borderline pitches

6
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:42,240
is being called a ball,

7
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:45,744
and all of their stupid swings
have been turning into hits.

Do you think I used up
all my good luck

a lot of luck, either.

You've been complaining
since the game started,

hits and three walks

managed to score.

They do look pretty frustrated
over there, don't they?

16
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:09,726
Well, anyway, they don't
have any power hitters.

17
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:12,604
All they want is
to keep the ball in play.

18
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:14,773
[SOUICHIROU]
They won't get great hits,

right down the middle.

I've been thinking about it
since the start of this game.

47
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:13,243
These guys, they haven't got any
real hitters on their lineup,

48
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:15,203
so, all you've gotta
do is overpower them,

317
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,624
My goodness.

318
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:15,710
[indistinct chatter]

319
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:19,297
The crowd of spectators just
keeps getting bigger every day.

320
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,634
Well, that makes sense.

321
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:31,643
Oh! Hey, Otomi! Congrats to ya.

322
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:33,478
Your brothers are doing well!

323
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:35,480
[OTOMI]
Yes, thank you!

324
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:37,065
[SHOP CLERK A]
I'm rooting for you guys.

325
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:38,900
Here's a little extra.

326
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:42,737
[OTOMI]
Wow. You sure? Appreciate it!

327
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,739
[FISH SHOP MANAGER]
And this one's on the house.

328
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,908
[OTOMI]
What? That's not necessary!

329
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:50,078
[FISH SHOP MANAGER] I know,
my treat! A good luck gift!

330
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,872
[FRUIT SHOP MANAGER]
Otomi! Otomi!

331
00:18:53,873 --> 00:18:55,875
[SHOP CLERK B]
Hey! Otomi!

332
00:18:57,043 --> 00:18:58,461
This is heavy.

333
00:18:58,545 --> 00:19:01,381
People don't know how much
weight their kindness carries.

334
00:19:02,757 --> 00:19:04,300
[OTOMI]
Hm?

335
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,721
[OTOMI panting]

336
00:19:07,804 --> 00:19:09,347
[OTOMI]
Hmm?

337
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:14,477
[OTOMI]
Mita?

338
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:17,731
[OTOMI]
Interesting.

339
00:19:17,814 --> 00:19:20,316
I wonder who that guy could be.

340
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,818
[KOMA] That's Ryou Akai's
older brother.

341
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:23,778
[OTOMI]
Huh?

342
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:26,865
Whoa, okay.

343
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:29,951
Who is this person talking
to me like we're friends?

344
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:33,413
Yo!

345
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:35,248
What, Koma?

346
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:37,584
I hope you're not stalking me.

347
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,627
[KOMA]
No, no, no.

348
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,047
It's just that there are
so many Meisei fans around,

349
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,257
I can't seem to get
a break from all of it.

350
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:47,260
I was about to pass out from
lack of air, so I dressed up.

351
00:19:47,344 --> 00:19:49,387
[OTOMI] And you're
skipping practice, too?

352
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:51,639
I like to refer
to it as a break.

353
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,641
Not that it's
really my business,

354
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,227
but your outfit,
what's the deal with that?

355
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:59,814
I can't exactly walk around town
wearing my uniform these days,

356
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,067
so I came up with this disguise.

357
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,653
Seems like you've taken
"breaks" like these before.

358
00:20:06,654 --> 00:20:08,865
Wait did you say
Akai's older brother?

359
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:11,534
Oh, back to that subject?

360
00:20:11,618 --> 00:20:14,162
[inaudible]

361
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:16,581
That's the stepbrother
he can't get along with,

362
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:21,002
the baseball genius, who happens
to be Kenjo's cleanup hitter.

363
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,170
Uhh...

364
00:20:22,253 --> 00:20:23,421
Are you for real?

365
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:25,632
I hadn't heard
about all that drama.

366
00:20:25,715 --> 00:20:30,720
Is he dating Mita?
If so, since when?

367
00:20:30,804 --> 00:20:32,681
[KOMA]
I'll go ask 'em. [gasps]

368
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,307
No, you will not, blockhead!

369
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:35,767
What?

370
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,935
[OTOMI grunts]

371
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:38,103
Right.

372
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:41,606
[OTOMI] Since we're almost
out of time in this episode,

373
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,150
I'll pretend
I didn't see anything!

374
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:45,235
[KOMA]
Huh?

375
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:50,824
[KOMA] Got a lot to carry.
Been shoppin'?

376
00:20:50,907 --> 00:20:54,035
I didn't plan to. My dad
begged me to pick up a copy

377
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,495
of every morning sports paper,

378
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:58,248
and people just gave
me all this stuff.

379
00:20:58,331 --> 00:21:00,500
[KOMA] Your dad must be
thrilled about the whole thing.

380
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,294
To say he's thrilled is the
understatement of the year.

381
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:05,547
He was going on about
it the whole night.

382
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,008
Talk about disturbing
the peace, right?

383
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:09,884
He's not the only
one going nuts.

384
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,220
Lots of people are freaking out.

385
00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:14,723
Yeah, you're not wrong.

386
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:18,518
Toushu's next if we win?

387
00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:20,437
[KOMA]
That's right.

388
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,480
[OTOMI]
Hm?

389
00:21:22,564 --> 00:21:23,982
[KOMA]
Hm?

390
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:26,443
Things seem to be
going too well.

391
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,989
Yeah, now that you mention it,

392
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:34,617
developments like this
always make me a little uneasy.

--Just because--

[KOMA, OTOMI]
Hm?

You idiot! You trying
to get killed?

Do you know that guy?

I don't, not at all.

400
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:00,602
All right! I can see it now--

Are you serious?

00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,996

Next time, on <i>Mix</i> :

404

Huh? Where'd our manager go?

405
00:23:45,165 --> 00:23:46,166
[SOUICHIROU]
If I remember correctly,

406
00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:47,709
he's at the local shrine.

407

[TOUMA]
Let's see...

408

good health, safe delivery...

410
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:55,550
He got all these amulets?

411
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:57,802
[SOUICHIROU] There's even
a pressed four-leaf clover.

00:23:57,886 --> 00:23:59,888

I also pulled a fortune slip!

[SOUICHIROU] Next time,
"You're Praying for Help."

What does the slip say?
