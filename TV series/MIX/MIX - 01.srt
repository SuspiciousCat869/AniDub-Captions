[NARRATOR] It's been 30 years
since that glorious summer.

And now, the once-triumphant
Meisei baseball team

will be making its
electrifying return.

a pitcher and a catcher.

13

Along with their younger

life's countless adventures
while aiming for the top.

The three share one goal:
Get to the Koshien Tournament!

[NARRATOR]
Meisei High School only tasted

17
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,250
a championship victory once.

18
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,500
Many summers have
followed since their win.

19
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,500
And though generations
of teams tried their best,

20
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:31,000
the school never again
managed to return to Koshien.

You're the one who
should be squatting, Sou!

Y'know, most kids do what their
big brothers tell them to.

[TOUMA laughs] Why would
you be my "big" brother?

25
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,833
We were born on
the exact same day!

26
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,083
[SOUICHIROU] Yeah, but you've
seen the birth certificates.

27
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:54,250
I was officially born ten
minutes earlier than you!

28
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,708
[TOUMA]
And why should I trust those?

29
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,833
For all I know, my hospital
could've just been lazy!

30
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,166
Or maybe they forgot to check
the time and just guessed!

31
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,833
Even if mine's right,
yours could've been wrong!

32
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,166
They were probly sick of waiting
for you and just wrote down

33
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,708
whatever time they wanted.

34
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,291
Plus! We have no way of knowing

35
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,958
if the clocks in
either one of our hospitals

36
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:17,208
were right that day. Heck,
they could even still be off!

37

Man, it sure sounds
like someone's put

a lot of thought into this.
