[SOUICHIROU]
After today's match,

182
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,750
I'm convinced our team
has what it takes

183
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:02,291
to become an actual threat.
With some adjustments, that is.

184
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,208
First, we need to
make you our ace pitcher

185
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,791
and actually give our backup
pitchers the support they need.

186
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,875
Yeah.

187
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,250
Although...

188
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,541
What can we do if you're
still stuck at third base,

189
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,333
when autumn rolls around?

190
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,666
Our manager may
keep you there, you know.

191
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,250
It's obvious he's
trying to tame us.

192
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,791
Also... In high school,

193
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,125
Nikaidou will be
on the team again.

194
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,500
His father's influence
there is just as big as it is

195
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,333
at our junior high.

196
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,333
Plus, I could even see him

197
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,000
getting our current manager to
take over the high school team.

198
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,916
[TOUMA] That's enough.
Don't worry about it.

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,333
I'm not planning on dealing
with them for that long.

200
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,333
This isn't the only school
with a baseball team.

201
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,750
But your dad
went to Meisei High.

202
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,125
Yeah. And because of that,

203
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,291
I've been forced
to root for Meisei

204
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,375
for as long as I can remember.

205
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,083
And every time,
I'm so disappointed

206
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,208
when we lose so bad.

207
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,166
Honestly, I don't
care about that place.

208
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,958
The only thing it has
going for it is the fact

209
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,000
that it's a minute
away from our house.

210
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,125
And that's all.

affects both of us.

I doubt you've forgotten,
but you're the one

00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,958
who made me a catcher.

let you regret it.

You just had the horrible
misfortune of landing

321
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,541
a lousy manager, and now
you gotta deal with it.

[ICHIBAN sighs]

324
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,166
[OTOMI] So did you
submit the resignation?

325
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,708
There's no way
I would quit the baseball club!

326
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,458
It's my destiny!
Summer's ace pitcher!

327
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,416
I'll take the mound at Koshien!

328
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,958
Yeah, yeah.

329
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,541
You know if things don't work
out, you can change schools.

[ICHIBAN]
No way!

331
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:34,000
I can't, because my destiny
goes beyond just pitching there!

332
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,541
Now it includes
pitching while Otomi Tachibana

333

performs in the background

[TOUMA]
Not really.

375
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,041
He doesn't have enough pitch
variety to give him the luxury

of saying no to you.

Either way, I gotta
give the guy credit.

When the chips are down, you can
still sense he's determined,

still looked happy...
