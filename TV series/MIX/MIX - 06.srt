Oh. I, um...

I'm just curious,
has this family suffered

some misfortune recently?

[NARRATOR] It's been 30 years
since that glorious summer.

00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,583
And now, the once-triumphant
Meisei baseball team

00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,250
will be making its
electrifying return.

11
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,125
[NARRATOR] This is the
story of two brothers,

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,041
a pitcher and a catcher.

00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,958
Along with their younger
sister, they face

life's countless adventures
while aiming for the top.

The three share one goal:
Get to the Koshien Tournament!

Dang it! Well, it looks like
we worried for nothing.

They insisted there's
been no misfortune

for the Nikaido family lately.

was more like a miracle.

[TADASHI]
Hey! Sorry I'm late.

[NARRATOR]
A long time ago,

24
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,083
the ace pitcher's father was
also on the Meisei team,

25
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,000
and in the very same position.

26
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,291
[NARRATOR]
Although, unlike his son,

27
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,333
in all the years he spent in
junior high and high school,

28
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,291
he never wore the ace uniform.

29
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,333
But, in those six years,
his genuine personality,

30
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,125
in stark contrast to his severe
looks, was the source

31
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,000
of countless fond memories
shared by the team.

32
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,791
Helping the boys forge
lifelong friendships.

33
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,625
The man's talent
would continue to bloom

34
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,000
after he took over
his father's business,

35
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:42,375
which he developed into
a successful major corporation.

36
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,541
Because of his stern look,
some were wary of him.

37
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,750
But those who knew him
well never had a harsh word

38
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,250
to say about him.

39
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,458
Or, so it goes.

40
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,833
The man had his only child,
a son, later in life.

41
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,708
He cherished the boy more
than most parents might.

42
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,375
When his son
began to play baseball,

43
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,333
the father was overjoyed.

44
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,208
He didn't care what anyone
thought when he bragged

45
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,416
that the boy was
a veritable prodigy.

46
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,875
In autumn of the
boy's seventh grade year,

47
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,416
the man couldn't help but
weep at the sight of his son

48
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,416
in the number one uniform.

49
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,000
Even though the team
manager had been

50
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,541
the man's best friend
since they were boys,

51
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:21,125
the man believed in his son's
talent and never doubted him.

52
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,833
It never crossed his mind
that the manager

53
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,666
might be playing favorites.

54
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,083
Then, six months later,

55
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:31,000
the son was diagnosed
with a rare heart condition.

Oh. Hey, Natsuno.

I went by your house,

but your mom was
the only one home.

She told me you came to
the pool, so I ran over.

I'm actually looking
for your brothers.

tell anyone why or anything!

of the operation
succeeding were.

the manager was the only person
who knew about your condition.

I've daydreamed about
you learning the truth.

[DAISUKE]
Only my dad had any hope.

He was sure the operation
would be a success.

109
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,500
Why were you so sure
it would be a failure?

110
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,875
Your dad was right.

111
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,208
But would you say he was right

112
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,875
when he told everyone
I was a baseball prodigy?

113
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,750
I didn't think I had much time.

114
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:46,208
So, the best way I knew to thank
my dad for believing in me

115
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,750
was to wear the
ace uniform and pitch

116
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,458
as many games as possible.

117
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,291
I mean, I can
think of other ways.

I dunno, like not dying
before your time?

119

You shouldn't hate
the manager for this.

120

I insisted on being
the ace pitcher,

121
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,375
and he was a loyal friend.

122

He refused to crush my father's
dreams and his unwavering belief

00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,708
that I really was ace material.

00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,333
Well, he took responsibility
and ended up quitting.

125
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:14,125
[DAISUKE] Yeah. I tried to stop
him, but he wouldn't listen.

Look, I'm not
going to apologize.

'Cause, like I said, I was
convinced I wouldn't make it.

What if something
happened to her?

160
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,125
I would hold you responsible!

161
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,208
If you're so worried,

162
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,000
why don't you go
and get her yourself?

163
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,708
Because it's your duty
as her older brother

164
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,916
to make sure she's
safe at all times!

[TOUMA]
You know what?

[SOUICHIROU] Stop talking
nonsense and go get your sister!

[DAISUKE'S FATHER] You're Touma
Tachibana, aren't you?

178
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,583
[TOUMA]
Uh, yeah?

179
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,666
[DAISUKE'S FATHER]
My son asked me

180
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,750
to personally
deliver this to you.

181
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,583
[DAISUKE'S FATHER]
For a single game,

182
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,666
the pitcher who will become the
next ace is supposed to borrow

183
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,750
the previous ace's number,

184
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,833
then replace it with a new
number one after that.

185
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,458
It's an old tradition in
the Meisei baseball club.

186
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,500
Well, you've got to follow
a prodigy like my son.

187
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,166
I'm sure you're feeling a
tremendous amount of pressure.

188
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,875
[NARRATOR]
He feels no pressure.

189
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,791
Whatever you do,
make sure you pitch in a way

190
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,125
that won't bring shame
to that ace number.

191

[laughs]

192
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,333
[NARRATOR]
That's going to be easy!

193
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,291
And please return
the number after the game.

194
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,041
It is a treasure
in our family, after all.

195
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,291
Yes, sir, I understand.

196
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,541
[DAISUKE'S FATHER]
Right. I'll be going now.

197
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,291
[TOUMA]
Oh, the surgery!

198
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,250
I'm really happy
it was a success.

Age, 14 years and two months.

[NARRATOR]
Now, then.

209
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,708
Because of the fact that
Manager Kuroyanagi just resigned

210
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,333
without giving the
team any explanation...

211
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,750
[NARRATOR] ...many of the
players left and never returned

212
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,500
after the Tokyo Tournament
because they were fed up,

213
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,958
[NARRATOR] On top of that,
most of the players who left

214
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,750
were in their
final year at Meisei

215
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,708
and had the most experience.

216

However, the Meisei
Junior High baseball club--

a mostly new team now made up
of seventh and eighth graders--

218

were still an elite force with

You haven't given me
a single sign

Shut up, moron.

Don't you dare
talk to me like that, ya jerk!

235
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,125
You know your
fastball wouldn't even

236
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,583
make contact with their bats.

What?

238
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,416
[SOUICHIROU] What our
guys need most right now

239
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,583
is practice fielding in a game.
So, that's what I'm focusing on.

240
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,291
[ICHIBAN]
He's a good captain.

[TOUMA]
Oh, I get it!

242
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,083
Then how 'bout I just
throw you a breaking ball

243
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,375
that won't hit the bat either.
Is that what you want?

to me like that, dammit!

Know why your
breaking balls work?

247
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,250
It's because of how effective
your fastball is.

He is a good Captain.

a hang of the rules now?

255
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,500
I think so. I had no idea
there were so many

Especially for Touma.

259
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,333
The new captain is just

260
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:28,166
trying to help us save face.
For my dad and I, that is.

261
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,500
If a new ace stepped
on the mound

262
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,458
at the first practice
and blew them away,

263
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,125
it would put us in a bad light.

264

When you're in high school,
can't you keep playing baseball?

it's a miracle I'm
even standing here.

267

00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,208
that I got so upset
over his toe.

474
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,333
But then Sou
misunderstood the situation

475
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,666
and punched Tou for laughing.

476
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,208
That's why Tou ended up
becoming the ace pitcher.

477
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,291
Heh. Just kidding.

478
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,208
[ICHIBAN]
Hey, Otomi!

479
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,625
Where ya head--

480
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,416
[yelps, yells]

481
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,958
[grunts]

482
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,750
Are you all right, Natsuno?

483
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,125
I hope you didn't
tear your nail off.

484
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,375
[ICHIBAN]
Huh...?

485
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,916
When spring comes,
you're off to high school.

486
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,416
Crazy.

487
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,583
[ICHIBAN]
You'll be in ninth grade, too.

488
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,291
[OTOMI]
Yeah. I suppose so.

489
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,333
[OTOMI]
Next time, on Mix!

490
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,541
[TOUMA] Apparently, Meisei High
School won the national trophy

491
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,125
in something other than
the Koshien tournament.

492
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,416
[SOUICHIROU]
Yeah. Rhythmic gymnastics.

493
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,333
[TOUMA]
That's not what I expected.

494
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,500
I wondered what
was going on in the gym.

495
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,250
Hey.,where are you going?

496
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,375
[SOUICHIROU]
Out for a jog.

497
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,750
[TOUMA]
Oh? Then I am, too!

498
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:50,125
[OTOMI] The gymnasium's
the other way, guys!

499
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,125
[OTOMI]
Next time: "Worried?"

500
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,416
Hey! You better stop peeking!

501
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,708
[PUNCH barks]
