He stopped them before

21

He just got insanely lucky.

22
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,250
The last half-dozen pitches
he threw would have been

23
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,500
a homerun with a good batter.

he gave up only one run.

two grades below us.

To be perfectly clear,

73
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,916
me and the wife never
spoke much about the guy.

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,625
I thought it better not
to ask too much about him.

75
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:21,000
So I only learned who
he was after we got married.

know a thing about it.

80
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,000
Apparently, Sawai
rarely talked about

baseball or otherwise.

00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,541
Can't you see
I'm trying to clean here?!

161
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,791
Get out of the way!

162
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,041
Would you stop?!

163
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,791
If you ruin this shirt,
you're gonna pay for it

164
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,208
out of your allowance!

165
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,750
[SOUICHIROU yawns]

166
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:26,083
[OTOMI] C'mon! Just let go!
Seriously, you're such a jerk!

167
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,666
[SOUICHIROU] Hey, Touma.
Wanna go for another run?

168
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,791
Sure.

169
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,250
If you two are itching
for a workout that badly,

170
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,291
why don't you
just go to practice?

171
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,083
No way! If I ran
into our manager right now,

172
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,125
I don't think I could resist the
urge to clock him in the jaw.

173
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,250
Yeah. I guess I'd have trouble

174
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,625
listening to him after
that last game, too.

175

[PUNCH whines]

176
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,958
[OTOMI] But what do you guys
plan to do from now on?

177
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,000
[TOUMA] We've been thinking
about that a lot.

178
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,666
--Haven't we, Sou?
--Yeah.

179
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,875
Could you be more cryptic?

180
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,333
[doorbell rings]

181
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,750

--[SOUICHIROU] Nishimura.
--Uh, hey, Tachibana brothers!

185
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,500
This is weird.
How'd you find our address?

186
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,500
[NISHIMURA chuckles]
I asked around the neighborhood

187
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,958
and got a quick answer.

188
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,333
Home of remarried
couple, each with kids.

189
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,375
The two sons are both
in the same grade.

190
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,916
And they have a sister who's
one year younger than them.

191
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,250
Speaking of which.
That's her, right?

192
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,291
[SOUICHIROU]
Yeah.

193
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,625
She's pretty cute.

194
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,541
So I hear you didn't
make it past the semifinals

195
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,958
at the Tokyo Tournament.

196
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,750
Yeah. We missed our chance

197
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,291
of getting into the
Kanto Tournament by a hair.

198
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,291
But... It's pretty
obvious why we failed.

199
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,500
Why did you?

200
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,083
Well, when it comes down to it,

201
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,208
I've never been blessed
with a good catcher.

202
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,208
What's her name?

203
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,208
Huh?

204
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,375
Your sister, duh.

205
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,791
[growls]
Otomi.

206
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,208
Oh, cute name, too.

207
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,583
That's enough. Why are you here?

208
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,625
[NISHIMURA] Oh, I was wondering
if you'd be interested

209
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,750
in meeting my dad today.

210
00:12:58,833 --> 00:12:59,916
[BOTH]
Hmm?

211
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,333
If you seriously
wanna make it to Koshien,

212
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,375
you're gonna need
to make some changes.

213
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,708
You know the spring tournament?

214
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,208
Seinan High made it there.

215
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,333
My dad's the current
manager of the team.

216
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,500
Whaddya say?

217
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,666
Team up with me
and we'll make it far.

218
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,583
Beyond Koshien,
we'll go to nationals!

219
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,458
Sorry, but I have
no intention of leaving Touma.

220
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,791
Totally fine!

221
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:22,083
My dad's looking for
a solid third baseman, too.

222
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,666
Come on, what
have you got to lose?

223
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,333
Just come take a peek at Seinan.
You'll start dreaming bigger!

224
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,666
Your thoughts?

225
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,875
Well, we have been
thinking about other schools.

226
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,416
And we've got
nothing else to do.

227
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,125
That's the spirit!

228
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,750
Hey, maybe your sister
wants to come along.

229
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,041
She does not!

230
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,125
What's that school?

231
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,375
That one over there?
That's Kenjyou High School.

232
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,833
If I'm remembering right, it
used to be called Sumi Tech,

233
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,166
but they changed the
name a few years back.

234
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,041
I'm pretty sure that's
the opponent Meisei High

235
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,500
faced in the finals
the year they made it

236
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,291
to the Koshien Tournament.

237
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,666
Yeah, and now both teams
are equally uncompetitive.

238
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,708
It's pretty crazy
how much has changed.

239
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,458
Come on! A little further!

240

dad-- Uh, is the manager around?

our pitchers practice.

[ISAMI sighs]
What's up?

246
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,250
I brought a couple of guys that

247
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,541
I thought you might
want to meet.

248

Are you busy?

00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,791
[ISAMI] I've always got time
for the Tachibana brothers.

[BOTH]
Hmm

Do you know 'em?

Coach Kamata has been
singing both their praises.

253
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,416
He's had his eye on them
for quite some time.

Oh...

255
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,041
Sorry to hear about
the summer tournament.

256

You made top four, right?

257
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,250
Yeah. Winning
a tournament that size

258
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,750
is no cake walk,
that's for sure.

259
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,583
But, I can tell you
the exact reason that we lost.

00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,583
[PLAYER 05J grunts]
One more, just like that!

261
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,125
[ISAMI] It's become
increasingly clear to me,

262
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,583
since the Spring Tournament.

263
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,541
What this team really
lacks is an ace pitcher

264
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,208
and a main catcher.

265
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,541
[PLAYER 05L grunts]
That's it!

wait two more years, Dad!

And his brother
will come with him?

270

Oh, he's a great third baseman!

271
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,541
He's fast and
his throwing arm's--

272
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,500
[ISAMI] Hold on.
You're a pitcher, right?

273
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,583
[NISHIMURA]
Eh?

274
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,708
[ISAMI] What's more.
The word on the street

275
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:44,541
is that you're every bit
as talented as my son.

276
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,291
What?

277
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,208
[ISAMI]
I'm told that if you join us,

278
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,500
my son may not be able to
wear the number-one uniform.

279
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,541
So, I should
probably pass on it.

280
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,250
Who said that?

281
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,500
[ISAMI]
If you must know.

282
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,958
It was actually
your current manager.

283
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,416
Really...?

284
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,375
Well. Not that
I believe what a manager

285
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,333
with no achievements
has to say.

286
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,708
I only trust talented sources.

You might not
know just how bad

288
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,750
that man's reputation is.

289
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,541
No surprise there.

00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,416
Ah. Hmm...?

291
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,750
[ISAMI] Show me a pitch.
One'll be enough to tell.

292
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,500
Know why? Because I know
how to manage a team.

If you must.

00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,958
Given they were talented,

298
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,875
would you ever consider
giving the ace number

299

to someone other than your son?

Get a load of this guy, Takumi!

Listen up. Don't ever forget.

302
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,541
There's no such thing as
a pitcher more talented than

the manager's flesh and blood.

[YAMAKURA]
Yeah?

--[ISAMI gulps]

320
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,916
You were right.

321
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,416
It does look like you gotta do
something about your catchers.

322
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,250
Uh, yeah...

323
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,666
I'm sorry, Nishimura.

324
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,166
I want to see my brother
wearing the number-one uniform.

325
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
While we're on the same team.

326
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,666
Besides...

327
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,666
I think we've had just about all
we can take of doting fathers.

328
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,208
[laughs]

329
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,958
I can't blame you for
trying, Takumi,

330
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,041
but they're just not
meant to be here.

331
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,250
Let's get this straight.

332
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,875
First of all,
I hate Meisei High School.

333
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,750
I feel sick every time I take
a glance at that uniform.

334
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,416
But! To be fair.

335
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,208
Since becoming manager,
I haven't lost a game to them!

336
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,041
And it's pretty nice to have
a team that you know

337
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,208
you can destroy.

338
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,583
[laughs]

339
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,916
Seriously though,
they've turned into

340
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,208
such a pathetic
excuse for a team.

341
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,500
It's a damn shame.

342
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,083
[SOUICHIROU]
Touma. Let's go.

343
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,458
Okay.

344
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,000
[ISAMI]
Hmph.

345
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,458
After all these years.

346
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,458
Seeing him pitch reminds
me so much of Uesugi.

347
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,791
Why is that?

348
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,208
[NISHIMURA]
Tachibana!

349
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,208
Let me ask you just one thing!

350
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,541
What is it?

351
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,916
I wanna know how you
spell your sister's name.

352
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,958
[baseball bat clanks]

353
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,791
[window shattering]

354
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,625
[TOUMA] Nishimura's
pretty skilled. Isn't he?

355
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,291
[SOUICHIROU]
His dad, too. Right?

356
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,875
[TOUMA]
Seems so.

357
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:15,291
[ISAMI] They've turned into such
a pathetic excuse for a team.

358
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,541
Man, you know what sucks?

359
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,958
What?

360
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,708
How much it pisses me off
when someone else says it.

361
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:20,791
When they say what?

362
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,250
Bad stuff about Meisei.

363
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,875
[SOUICHIROU]
I gotta say, I'm surprised.

364
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,750
It's not easy to imagine
our manager saying

365
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,333
you're a better pitcher
than Nishimura.

366
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,000
I doubt it's true.

367
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,916
I mean really, that's
probably the last thing

368
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,625
the guy would ever say.

369
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,375
[SOUICHIROU] Yeah. The
man's trying to rein us in--

370
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,250
Why would he talk
about you that way?

371
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,500
[TOUMA]
Yup! Now you got me thinking

372
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,750
about how horribly he
handled our last game!

373
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,375
We could have won!
Doesn't he want us to do well?

374
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,666
He's so bad!

375
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:55,041
[SOUICHIROU]
I agree. Unless, for instance,

376
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,833
that was Nikaidou's
last time taking the mound.

377
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,041
Well, it was.

378
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,291
It's his last summer
in Junior High School.

379
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:07,166
[SOUICHIROU]
No. That's not what I mean.

380
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,958
I meant ever.

381
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,666
[OTOMI]
Hmm? [yelps]

382
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,375
[OTOMI] It's their stupid
baseball team manager.

383
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,416
Is that all he came here to do?

384
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,625
[TOUMA]
Next time, on Mix.
