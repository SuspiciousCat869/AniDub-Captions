[YOSHIKO'S MOTHER]
Now, Otomi, are you sure

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,666
that's the one you want?

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,791
[OTOMI] Totally! Had my heart
set the moment I saw him!

[DOG pants]

00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,458
[YOSHIKO'S MOTHER]
As long as you're sure.

6
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:19,458
[YOSHIKO]
Just promise me you're not

7
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,583
gonna change your mind later.

8
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,541
[OTOMI]
I promise.

9
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,833
[YOSHIKO]
Take good care of him, okay?

10
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,083
[OTOMI]
I will!

11
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:36,166
We'll have lots
of fun together, Punch!

[PUNCH barks]

13
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,125
[NARRATOR]
With a name like "Punch,"

14
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,041
you've got to have
a stronger bark!

15

[PUNCH growls, barks]

16
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,416
[NARRATOR] It's been 30 years
since that glorious summer.

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,541
And now, the once-triumphant
Meisei baseball team

18
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,166
will be making its
electrifying return.

19
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,125
[NARRATOR] This is
the story of two brothers,

20
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,000
a pitcher and a catcher.

21
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,250
Along with their younger
sister, they face life's

22
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,916
countless adventures
while aiming for the top.

23

The three share one goal:
Get to the Koshien Tournament!

[PITCHERS groaning]

26
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,083
Nice catch, man!

27
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,166
[SOUICHIROU] It doesn't
look like there's much hope

28
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,833
this time, either.

29
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah...

30
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,916
Our pitcher's the problem.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,750
We need someone else
on the mound.

32
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,291
That way we could
at least put up a fight.

33
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,791
But unfortunately
for us, the manager's the one

34
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:10,458
who gets to make that call,
and he only likes one player.

35
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,791
[SOUICHIROU]
Yup. Nikaidou.

36
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:17,041
He's only gonna be our ace
until this summer, though.

37
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,000
[TOUMA] Well, I certainly hope
you're right about that.

38
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:23,083
[MAYUMI]
Souichirou! Tou, dear!

39
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,708
Hope you're hungry,
'cause I bought some taiyaki!

40
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,291
Come home soon
so you can have some!

41
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,916
Hey, Tou, dear. You hear that?

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,458
Shut up.

43
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:43,208
[TOUMA] Could you just call me
by my full name already?

44
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,291
You worry way
too much about that.

45
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:49,208
I'm your mother, can't I have a
cute little nickname for my son?

46
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,333
And before you say anything,

47
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,041
no one thinks you're
five little tootsies.

48
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,708
Nobody in this
neighborhood at least,

49
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,625
they're used to it.

50

Oh, she's telling the world,

51
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,458
even explained it to the
mailman the other day.

52
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,875
[MAYUMI laughs] Well, I want you
to be comfortable with it.

53
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,000
And besides you call me
"mother," even though

54
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,500
I'm technically
your step mother,

55
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,916
so you deserve
an endearing name, too!

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,750
[TOUMA] You want me to
call you "step mother"?

57
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,083
By the way...

58
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,875
Could someone explain
why this little furball's

59
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,416
slinking around the house?

There you are, Punch!

[PUNCH grunts, barks]

63

[MAYUMI] That's the puppy
Otomi got from Yoshiko.

I'm sure you remember
us talking about it.

[OTOMI giggles]

66
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,791
What made you decide
to go with the name "Punch"?

67
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,458
[OTOMI]
Well... It's kind of silly.

68
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,125
But before I went
to bed the other night,

69
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,666
I was trying really hard
to think of a good name.

70
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,166
[OTOMI] And then this strange
person appeared in my dream.

71
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,208
[OTOMI]
He gave me the idea, said he's

72
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,041
"leaving the rest to me,"
and disappeared.

73
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,541
[MAYUMI] Interesting. Then he
was meant to be named that.

74
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,625
It must be fate.

[school bell chimes]

Got lucky. I overheard your mom.

She was explaining it
at the taiyaki place.

You know, the one
right by the station?

101
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,125
She wasn't quiet.

102
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,000
She explained
the whole family structure.

103

baseball! It's so funny!

Now that that's out of the way,

What is with our baseball club?!
It's all over the place!

Anyone with a brain
can see that your brother

109
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,375
is leagues better than
our current ace pitcher!

110
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,000
Obviously.

111
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,583
That's not the half of it!

112
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,458
The team doesn't have a single
decent backup pitcher, either.

113

So why'd I get stuck
kicking dirt in the outfield?!

Well, in a way,

115
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,791
that's actually proof that
you've been recognized

116

as a decent pitcher.

makes a lick of sense!

What's the point if they're not
even gonna be serious about it?

Well, they've got some
really good gear and facilities,

don't they?

Don't you think?

You want out, Miyata?

Ah. I, uh...

[TOUMA] If you don't wanna
do it anymore, just tell him.

145
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,208
He isn't some total jerk.

146
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,916
He wouldn't take advantage
of the fact that your dad

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,250
works for his to make
you his lackey.

148
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,666
He's too good for that.

00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:10,041
I've heard things.
Like what you do after I leave.

152
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,833
They say you've been
secretly practicing pitching.

You're wasting your
time doing that.

As long as I'm here, you
have absolutely no chance

155
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,291
of taking the pitcher's mound.

156
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,583
[DAISUKE]
You can count on that.

157

Oh, I'm fully aware.

be here much longer.

159
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,750
Just until fall.

160
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:30,958
[gasps]

161
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,000
I guess you're right.

162
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,041
I'll need to have a nice,
long chat with the manager.

163
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,083
We'll see what
happens after that.

164
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,166
[NATSUNO]
So that alumnus called Nikaidou.

165
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,875
Any relation to our ace?

166
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,083
[TADASHI] Yeah. He happens
to be our Nikaidou's father.

167
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,625
[TADASHI] President of
the appropriately named

168
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,375
Nikaidou Electric Company.

169
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,291
[TADASHI] Every year, he gifts
a ton of expensive equipment

170
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,625
to our club.

171
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,583
So that's where
we got all this stuff.

172
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,125
[TADASHI]
It gets more complicated.

173
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,708
He and our manager are former
players of the junior high

174
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,250
and high school teams.

175
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,541
And they're apparently
still pretty good friends.

176
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,541
[TADASHI] In case you
haven't put it together,

177
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,791
that's the reason that
our club's selfish ace gets

178
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,291
a free pass to do
whatever he wants.

179
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,250
Well, that explains a lot. Wait!

180
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,291
You're not telling me you're
okay with that, are you?

181
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,041
You're the captain Imagawa,
you should do something!

182
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,916
I wouldn't hold
your breath for that.

183
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,166
You see, Nikaidou and
I have known each other

184
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,250
since we were in grade school.

185
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,375
We may not be very close,

186
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,291
but I still consider
him a friend.

187
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,708
Don't know if he does.

188
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,541
[NATSUNO]
Hmm.

189
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:03,208
[SOUICHIROU]
Touma. Wanna throw? I'll catch.

190
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,125
But the manager hasn't left yet.

191
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,166
He's right there.

192
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,666
And why should
we care about that?

193
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,958
Good point. Why should we care?

194
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,416
[PLAYERS groan, chuckle]

195
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,875
Look at that throw.

196
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,333
[TEACHER 02A]
Miss Tachibana!

197
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,250
Break time is already over.

198
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,583
Would you be so kind as to
return to your seat now, please?

199
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,958
Natsuno, you want a turn?

200
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,208
Show us your arm.

201
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,333
[gasps]
Yeah, that'd be great!

202
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,916
Don't try copying
Touma's fastball.

203
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,250
Just focus on pitching
with your own style.

204
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay!

205
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,666
Hey, Tachibana. Just checking.

206
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,625
I didn't approve or
disapprove of this, did I?

207
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,250
Sure didn't. Just like usual.

208
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,916
It's all us.

209
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,458
That's the right answer.

210
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,625
[NATSUNO growls]
Hang on. I know this tune.

211
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,333
Don't they often play
this song at the Koshien?

212
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,458
I'm pretty sure they do.

213
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,458
I want to say it's
from that baseball anime

214
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,500
they had on TV a long time ago.

215
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,333
Uh... What's it called?

216
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,875
I think it's--

217
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,041
If you're not
gonna pitch, then I will.

218
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,333
Right.

219
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:21,750
[TOUMA groans]
Hey, Sou? What time is it?

220
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,166
[TOUMA]
Sou!

221
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,083
[TOUMA]
Hmm?

222
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,666
[TOUMA yawns]

223
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,833
[gargling]

224
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,416
Morning, everyone.

225
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,750
[OTOMI] Hey, lazy. Do you have
any idea what time it is?

226
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,458
I know it's Sunday,
but you still shouldn't

227
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,000
sleep in until 11.

228
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:53,125
[TOUMA] I tried to ask Sou
the time, but he disappeared.

229
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,666
Seen him?

230
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,833
He's on a date.

231
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,208
With who now?

232
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:03,125
No idea. With all these
girls lining up to date Sou,

233
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,750
there are too many
to possibly keep track of.

234
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,583
[TOUMA]
What about Mom and Dad?

235
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,125
They're on a date of their own.

236
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,416
Apparently, they're visiting
the Asakusa area.

237
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,875
They're eating lunch out
and should be home

238
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:15,875
before it gets dark.

239
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,291
[PUNCH snores]

240
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,166
[TOUMA] It's nice that
they still do stuff like that.

241
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,125
I know, right?

242
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,666
[TOUMA]
Although...

243
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,708
Mom's lowered her standards.

244
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,416
Seriously. They're both
just so different.

245
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,375
It's kinda funny.

246
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,416
Do you really think so?

247
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,041
Depending on the
angle of the shot,

248
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,375
Dad could pass as
a pretty good-looking guy.

249
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,750
Just like your biological Dad.

250
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,083
If you can show me
even one photo that proves that,

251
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,500
I'll treat you to all the cake
you can stuff your face with.

252
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,583
Whoa, really?
Challenge accepted!

253
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,250
Never mind.

254
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,416
If I keep looking,
it'll confirm I'm wrong.

255
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,583
You've gotta be
pretty familiar with Rakugo

256
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,750
to understand this.

257
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,791
It's fine,
I'm just happy to be here.

258
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:18,708
[TOUMA sighing]

259
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,208
Look at these.
Our Dad's an idiot.

260
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,916
He's got no decent photos.

261
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,791
[TOUMA groans]

262
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,916
Why am I not surprised he was
like that in school, too?

263
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,916
[TOUMA] Your double-digit number
is nothing to brag about, Dad.

264
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,375
[TOUMA] Yeah, this pitching
form says it all.

265
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,916
[TOUMA]
Man. So lame.

266
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,458
[OTOMI] Are you planning
to sit there all day

267
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,291
and make fun of our Dad, Tou?

268
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,333
Will you stop
calling me that already?

269
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,291
It's kinda confusing.

270
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,333
Confusing?
Because of the homophones?

271
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,916
I don't think so.

272
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,250
You're the only one
who has a problem with it.

273
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,750
[PUNCH chuckles]

274
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,958
[TOUMA]
Is the dog laughing?!

275
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,083
[sighs]
Whatever.

276
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,875
[TOUMA]
Now that I think of it.

277
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,541
There's something
about that uniform.

278
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,666
Oh, yeah. You're right.

279
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,041
Did you ask Dad about it, yet?

280
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:23,000
[TOUMA] I actually don't think
we should tell him we found it.

281
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,333
But why not?

282
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,041
I dunno, think about it.

283
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,875
He could have stolen it from
the club for all we know.

284
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,541
I kinda doubt that.

285
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,875
Hold on.

286
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,250
It's not as ridiculous as
you're making it sound.

287
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,666
You remember what he says
after a couple of drinks?

288
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,458
Come on...

289
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,875
[TOUMA] How just one time,
he would've loved to wear

290
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,541
the number one uniform
back in the day?

291
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,166
[EISUKE]
If I could just wear it once...

292
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,916
That is true.

293
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,041
[TOUMA]
So, let's keep our mouths shut.

294
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,291
Until he confesses.

295
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,750
Roger that!

296
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,083
[OTOMI]
Uniform number one.

297
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,291
[TOUMA]
Hmm?

298
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,458
[OTOMI] I'm looking forward
to when you take

299
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,875
the pitcher's mound...

300
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:05,041
...and are finally
Meisei's number-one.

[barks]

302
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,875
[OTOMI] Hey, if you feel like
going out somewhere, go ahead.

303
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,083
I'll hold down the
fort while you're gone.

304
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,916
Oh.

305
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,416
I did tell Koma I'd hang out
with him one of these days.

306
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,875
[OTOMI]
See you later.

307
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,583
[TOUMA]
Hmm?

308
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,166
[PEEPERS grunt]
Run!

309
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,750
[PEEPER 02B]
Hmm? Hmm?! Ahh!

310
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,416
[TOUMA groans]

311
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,625
[SOUICHIROU]
Thanks for today.

312
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,458
It was a lot of fun.

313
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,916
I should be thanking you!

314
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,250
You're not the only one who
thought today was a blast.

315
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,541
Sorry I don't have
more room in my schedule.

316
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,500
We'll have to spend more time
together on our next date.

317
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,708
Totally! I'd be happy to!

318
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,708
We'll talk again soon, okay?

319
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,125
Sounds like a plan.

320
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,250
Feel free to call me anytime!

321
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,500
I'll be waiting
to hear from you!

322
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,708
[gasps] Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing here?

323
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,750
I was just passing by,
no need to get so offended.

324
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,083
And where do you plan on going?

325
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,916
What's with the third degree?

326
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,333
Koma's house. I was gonna
go play some games with him.

327
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,833
And where's Otomi?

328
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,500
[TOUMA]
She's back home.

329
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:19,666
Didn't you notice
that Mom and Dad

330
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,583
aren't at home today either?

331
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,333
[TOUMA]
Yeah, I did.

332
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,125
And yet, you still left
her all by herself?

333
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,750
What's there to worry about?

334
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,958
She's not an elementary
schooler anymore.

335
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,041
[gasps]

336
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,208
Are you a complete idiot?

337
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,416
The older a girl gets, the more
dangerous it is for her

338
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,583
to be left on her own.

339
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,125
Go back home right now!

340
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,291
The only reason I made plans
today, despite Mom and Dad

341
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,083
going out, was because
I thought you'd be with Otomi.

342
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,583
[TOUMA]
That's not fair!

343
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,500
If that's how you feel,
why don't you go home

344
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,708
and stay with her!

345
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,458
You're finished
with your date, right?

346
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,500
The first game of the day. Yeah.

347
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,541
[TOUMA]
Huh?

348
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,583
But I've got
a doubleheader lined up.

349
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:09,666
[GIRL 02B]
Sou! Sorry if I'm a little late!

350
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,125
No worries!
I just arrived myself!

351
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,375
Listen, just turn
your bike around and go.

352
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,666
If anything were
to happen to Otomi,

353
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,208
I won't hesitate to beat
the crap out of you.

354
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,375
Come on, Sou.

355
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,208
You'll scare the
poor guy like that!

356
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,125
[SOUICHIROU chuckles]
I was just kidding, don't worry.

357
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,375
What do you say
we get outta here?

358
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,875
[TOUMA groans]

359
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,541
[NATSUNO chuckles]

360
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,208
[TOUMA]
Natsuno. What's up?

361
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,458
Not much. Hey, is Otomi
home today by any chance?

362
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,166
[growls]
And if she is? What's it to you?

363
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,708
Huh? Oh, nothing.

364
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,958
I was... Never mind.

365
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,583
Tell her I said "hi"...

366
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,166
--[TOUMA] Natsuno!
--[NATSUNO whimpers]

367
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,416
Yeah? That's me!

368
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,083
About your pitching form.

369
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,250
You've gotta relax your elbow
more, otherwise you'll end up

370
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,583
hurting your arm, and
then you'll be done for.

371
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,875
Keep that in mind.

372
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,375
Whoa. Okay.

373
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,208
Thanks a lot for
the advice, man.

374
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,333
[TOUMA]
Give me a break...

375
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,958
Two dates in one day?

376
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,291
[sighs]
He's so full of himself.

377
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,583
And why do I have to--

378
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,583
[PEEPERS chuckling]

379
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,208
--[PEEPERS scream]
--Get lost, you buncha perverts!

380
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,250
[PEEPER 02B] We weren't
doing anything, I swear!

381
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,541
No shame. [gasps]

382
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:31,375
[flute playing]

383
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,583
[MAYUMI] Otomi is an
especially shy girl, Tou, dear.

384
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:14,166
[TOUMA]
It took her... a whole month.

385
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,750
Hey, I'm back.

386
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,083
That was a short trip.

387
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,958
Was Koma not at home, then?

388
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:28,375
[TOUMA sighs] No. I never
made it to his place actually.

389
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,000
I remembered we had an argument
and didn't want to see him.

390
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,208
[OTOMI]
If you forgot about it,

391
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,541
it couldn't have been
that big of a deal.

392
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,333
[TOUMA]
I just didn't feel like going.

393
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,416
Yeah, I felt you the first time.

394
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,791
[barks]

395
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,000
Punch seems to have
really taken a liking to you.

396
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,333
That was fast.

397
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,583
[TOUMA] A far cry
from someone else I know.

398
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,250
Huh?

399
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,083
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

400
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,166
[OTOMI]
Hmm.

401
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,291
[barks]

402
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,625
[OTOMI]
Next time, on Mix.

403
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,583
What do you like about
Meisei High School?

404
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,750
[SOUICHIROU]
It's one minute from home.

405
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:36,958
[OTOMI]
What else?

406
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,375
[TOUMA] If you run,
it could be 30 seconds.

407
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,541
[OTOMI]
What else?

408
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:40,458
[SOUICHIROU] I can
come home during breaks

409
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:41,875
to get things I forgot.

410
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,125
[TOUMA] I can get up that
much later in the morning.

411
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,333
[SOUICHIROU]
I won't get wet on rainy days.

412
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:45,791
[TOUMA] My friends
can come straight over.

413
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,250
[OTOMI] So really, all you
care about is the distance.

414
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,708
[TOUMA, SOUICHIROU]
Huh?

415
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,875
[OTOMI] Next time, "The Heck
with Meisei High School."

416
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,333
What I like about it is... Huh.

417
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,291
[barks, chuckles]
