Dang. It sucks
that he's playing us.

194
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,000
If only he was facing
a weaker team,

195
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,916
especially for the opening game.

196

He could've made a much
stronger debut as a hitter.

[SOUICHIROU] Hmm...
A home run and a double?

Plus, the out at first base
that could've easily been

199
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,875
an extra-base hit.
His debut is plenty strong.

200

What if he strikes
out his last at bat?

201

the batter before him reaching

who's fault that is.

That's encouraging and all.

But I'm not sure that should be
coming from our cleanup hitter.

Especially when he can't
bring our third batter home,

Huh?

316
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,625
[DAISUKE] He deserves to wear
the number-one uniform.

317
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,625
[MAYUMI]
I'm home!

318
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,875
[PUNCH barks]

319
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,750
[MAYUMI sighs]

320
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,666
Today sure is a scorcher.

321
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,416
Well, would ya look at that?

322
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,875
You were a legendary
pitcher, weren't you?

323
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,541
[home phone rings]

324
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,041
[MAYUMI]
Hello? Tachibana residence.

325
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,458
Oh, hi, dear.

326
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:13,000
Huh? The result?
For what? For the game?

327
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,500
Oh! That's right.

328
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,500
[MAYUMI] No. I haven't
heard from them yet.

329
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,416
They said they'd call when
they're done with the game,

330
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,208
so I imagine
they're still playing.

331
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,333
[MAYUMI]
Yes, I know.

332
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,791
But there isn't anything
I can do about that!

333
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,291
All right, dear. I understand.

334
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,541
I'll see you later. Bye!

335
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,666
You never told me
much about it,

336
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,166
and you didn't have to.
I know your dream lives on.

337
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,958
Souichirou shares the
exact same dream you did.

338
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,833
[MAYUMI] And he's met the
best partner he could ask for.

339
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,625
[MAYUMI]
Of course!

340
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,750
I can't believe that
I didn't realize it sooner.

341
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,125
Now I finally understand
why I was able to move on

342
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,875
without any regrets.

343
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,041
It's all starting to make sense.

344
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh! That reminds me.

345
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,208
I picked up something
at the bookstore.

346
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,958
[MAYUMI] I'm going
to study so I can cheer

347
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,416
those kids on properly.

348
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,708
And I just know you
and Touma's dear mother

349
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,791
will be cheering for them, too.

350
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,083
[PUNCH barks]

351
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,166
[MAYUMI gasps]

352
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,166
Please try and
keep it down, Punch.

353
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,833
I know you haven't
appeared much lately,

354
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,375
but you can't make
a scene like this.

355
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,708
[PUNCH barks]

356
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,250
[MAYUMI sighs]

357
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:49,166
[MAYUMI] I wonder if
we're winning. I hope so.

358
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,166
[NARRATOR]
No. We're losing.

359
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,416
[HARUKA]
Next time, on <i>Mix</i> .

360
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,791
[OOYAMA]
Hmm...

361
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,333
[HARUKA] Sounds like
something's bothering you, Dad.

362
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,375
[OOYAMA] I'm just wondering
what the best order would be.

363
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,958
First up, I'll start with beer.
Second, some tofu.

364
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,208
Third, sashimi.

365
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,708
Fourth, fried chicken.
Fifth, skewered chicken.

366
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,458
I'll put whisky and soda sixth.

367
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:48,250
Seventh, Kimchi, and
eighth smashed pickles.

368
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,416
[HARUKA] I thought you were
talking about batting order!

369
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,666
Next time: "I wanted
to See That Expression."

370
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,291
[OOYAMA]
I'll top it off with some ramen!

371
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,333
