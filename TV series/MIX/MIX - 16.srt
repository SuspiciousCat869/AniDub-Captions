He can't be blamed for the way
the whole thing went down.

and get back to you.

a swim class the other day?

170
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,314
I'm sure we did.

171
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,357
Yeah, we did. Episode 14.

172
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,651
I knew it! Also,
why don't the boys ever

they're wearing swimsuits?

wouldn't have happened

180

to have seen any random car keys
laying around here, wouldja?

We've seen nothing
of the sort here, sir.

we're going to have a 50‐meter,
freestyle race between

got the top five times

Good luck!

Otomi! You got this, girl!

214
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,760
Just so you know...

215
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,513
I am in peak
condition for this race.

216

Huh?

217
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,516
In the last one,

218
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:32,186
I only lost because I had
sprained my neck in my sleep.

219
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,148
Do I even remember
the last race?

220
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,108
[ARISA] When I'm in
top shape like I am now,

221
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,569
there's no way that
you can outswim me.

even call that a race.

The Miss Meisei runner up
sure can swim fast!

Huh? Where's Otomi?

235
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,048
Otomi hasn't risen
to the surface yet.

236
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,758
Is she all right?

237
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,468
She'll come up in a sec,

238
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,553
after she's secured
a healthy lead.

She's giving them
a handicap to make the race

241
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,733
that much more exciting!
Good strategy, there, Otomi!

242
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,568
Mm‐hmm!

two girls in no time flat!

Nice! And the only one
left to overtake is...

Arisa! Don't let
her catch up to you!

an exciting battle!

that you sprained your neck

in your sleep, are ya?

You were amazing
out there, Arisa!

Yeah, that was so exciting!

264
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,895
I can't believe how fast
you were swimming!

What were you
doing out there, Otomi?

266
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,278
She's the one person you
can't lose to intentionally.

267

You'll never hear the end of it.

That's not it.
I didn't lose on purpose.

269
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,251
She was way faster
than last time, honestly.

270
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,628
Maybe Arisa really did
sprain her neck in her sleep

271
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,879
before the last race.

272
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,589
She did not, and you know it!

273
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,717
She was obviously
making crappy excuses!

Well, if that's the case...

Eleventh grade!

317
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,675
[MUROTANI]
Kenjirou Murotani!

318
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,972
[KOUMOTO]
I love flyballs! Twelfth grade!

319
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,933
[KOUMOTO]
Shigeru Koumoto!

320
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,019
[OGURA]
I have a great throwing arm!

321
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,522
Eleventh! Shuji Ogura!

322
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,483
[TADASHI]
Hey!

323
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,778
[SHIGEMATSU]
Leave the grounders to me!

324
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,448
Eleventh grade, Shigematsu!

325
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,199
[HIRAO]
I'm fast and good, too!

326
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,034
Twelfth grade! Hirao!

327
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,244
[TAKESHITA]
Any time, any place!

328
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,122
I'm your guy, Takeshita!

329
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,040
[We really gotta do
something about that.

330
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,584
They're overselling every play.

331
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:57,757
I think it's awesome.
They're so full of spirit.

332
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,176
If that's all it is, then fine.

333
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,469
But...

334
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,016
[NANGOU grunts]

335
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,396
[NANGOU grunts]

336
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,111
They're all trying way too hard.

337
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,197
I think the guys are trying
to show off for Haruka.

338
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,657
Well, let's just
hope it doesn't have

339
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,826
a lasting effect
on their swings.

340
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,020
[SOUICHIROU grunts]

341
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,942
Whose swing did he
say would be affected?

342
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,485
Yeah...

343
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,459
[TOUMA]
Next time, on Mix.

344
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,711
[SOUICHIROU] Our second game
is against Sankou High School.

345
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,838
Apparently, they've got
a stellar cleanup hitter.

346
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,423
[TOUMA]
Sankou High School.

347
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,008
Why does that
name sound familiar?

348
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,760
[SOUICHIROU] I think it's 'cause
that's who Mita from Toushu

349
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,511
played in his debut match.

350
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,680
[TOUMA] No, I know it from
something before that.

351
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,223
[SOUICHIROU] Back in the day,
they made it to Koshien

352
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,224
two years in a row.

353
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,225
[TOUMA]
No, even before that.

354
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,769
It was something to
do with Meisei High.

355
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,938
[SOUICHIROU] Next time:
"He Reminds Me of Someone!"

356
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,649
[TOUMA] I remember! That one
game from 30 years ago!

357
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,942
[PUNCH barks]
