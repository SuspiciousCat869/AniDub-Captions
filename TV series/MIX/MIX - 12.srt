[DAISUKE'S FATHER]
Rainy season's almost here.

2
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,333
Seems like it shows
up earlier every year.

3
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,583
Right, Son?

4
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:25,958
[DAISUKE]
Hmm?

5
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:30,583
Uh. Such a gloomy
few months, huh?

6
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,375
[DAISUKE] Tournament match-ups
will be drawn on the 21st.

00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,833
Opening ceremonies
on the 5th of next month.

Uh, wha... What are
you talking about?

9
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,000
[DAISUKE]
Guess.

10
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,666
[ISAMI] I hear he's playing
well in the practice games.

11
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,291
Hasn't given up
a single run yet.

[PLAYER 12A grunts]

13
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,791
I gotta hand it to ya,
you were right when you said

14
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,666
you saw great things
in that third baseman.

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,541
Shyeah.

16
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,458
It might actually be
possible for us to face them

17
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,666
this year for a change.

18
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,416
Meisei High School,
at the summer tournament.

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,291
That would be kinda cool. Yeah?

20
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:12,041
If I had a say in it.

21
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,625
I'd honestly rather not.

22
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,875
Because, if I beat
them up too badly,

23
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:19,750
Otomi might decide she
doesn't like me anymore.

[PLAYER 12A grunts]

25
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,041
The way you talk about it,

26
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,791
sounds like you're
confident she likes you now.

27
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,375
Sure, she likes me!

28
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,958
The other day,
she made me her special,

homemade spaghetti Napolitan!
Anyway, I am the greatest, so...

30
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,166
You know just because
you are my son does not mean

31
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,541
you have to make
the same mistakes I did.

32
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:38,625
Huh? Sure, whatever.

33
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,791
Only thing in
the way of Koshien

34
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,500
is Hiroki Mita from
Toushu High School!

00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,625
Noice!

36
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,250
Okay, if you say so.

37
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,083
Tokyo is, you know, kinda big.

38
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,458
[NARRATOR] It's been 30 years
since that glorious summer.

39
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,625
And now, the once-triumphant
Meisei baseball team

40
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,125
will be making its
electrifying return.

41
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,041
[NARRATOR] This is the
story of two brothers,

42
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,916
a pitcher and a catcher.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,791
Along with their younger
sister, they face

44
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,875
life's countless adventures
while aiming for the top.

45
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:16,875
The three share one goal:
Get to the Koshien Tournament!

Oh, do you know him?

Kind of. He's one of
Otomi's friends from school.

[TOUMA] I'm guessing
that's his house.

I, uh... I heard
that Ryou had to

68
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,333
stay home today with a cold.

69
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,000
I got kinda worried.

70
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,625
I came to... see...

71

[ARISA]
Uh?

73
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,083
My little brother
did not catch a cold.

74
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,458
He's just skipping school.

75

[AKAI] He ran off to play
somewhere and hasn't come home.

[TOUMA] Why would you tell
a ridiculous lie like that?

00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,416
I literally saw him open
the window to his room

78
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,166
a few minutes ago.

79
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,666
He was wringing out
a wet towel and coughing.

80
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,291
Who're you? His stalkers?

81
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,375
Nah, we were just passing by.

82
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,125
[AKAI] How about you hurry up
and "pass by" then?

Hey, what the hell
is your problem, man?

She went through the trouble
of checking on your brother,

85
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,333
so you should tell
her the truth!

the drama. I'm leaving.

around, maybe carry an umbrella.

to check out his bag?

Why?

98
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,708
He's on the Kenjo

That's why.

Oh. They used to be Sumi Tech.

like that in a few years?

102

That's so rude!

It's incredibly rare.

about our late dad.

on the Meisei team! Also, he--

160
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,416
[SOUICHIROU] Was the ace
pitcher in his first year.

161
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,791
And I hear they
made it all the way

162
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,791
to the quarterfinals
that summer.

163
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,041
[OTOMI sighs]
Wait, how do you know?

164
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,875
[OOYAMA]
Nah, it's amazing.

165
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:53,333
You remember everything,
don't you, master?

166
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,083
For real. I can't believe
you remember all that.

167
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,416
Of course I do!

168
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,750
How could anybody ever
forget the pure thrill

169
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,833
of that Meisei
championship year?

170
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,500
[RYUUICHI] I've been following
the Meisei team ever since

171
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,416
that summer, and I didn't
even go there myself.

172
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
For years, I didn't
miss a single game--

173
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,250
not even a practice one.

174
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,833
I'd close shop every time
they were playing,

175
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,458
so the coffee shop
I ran in those days

176
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,791
went out of business in no time.

177
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,583
I'll be. Well, that's
quite a story, huh.

178
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:24,125
Is it, though, Dad?
The man lost his shop.

179
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,500
[RYUUICHI] But, the truth is,
these past few years,

180
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,125
I haven't been motivated to keep
up with their progress.

181
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,333
At least not enough
to lose business.

182
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,958
Yeah, they've been
in a long slump.

183
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,416
It's sad, really.
I hope to change that.

184
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,375
[RYUUICHI]
Here you go. Hot gyoza.

185
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,416
[OOYAMA]
Thanks, looks delicious.

186
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,916
This year, I'm watching
the tournament.

187
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,458
I'll cheer you on.

188
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,875
Huh? Well, thank you,
I'd appreciate that.

189
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,208
Sorry, buddy.

190
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,416
It has nothing to do with
you managing the team.

191
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,125
--[OOYAMA] Huh?
--It's because of Keiichi Sawai!

192
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,833
Keiichi Sawai, man!

193
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,958
[OOYAMA]
Hmm?

194
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,708
Ever since the year Meisei won
the national championship,

195
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,625
no other pitcher
could compare to him.

196
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,958
Sawai was just that incredible.

197
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,458
He gave Meisei something
to dream about.

198
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,958
[OOYAMA] Do you remember
the catcher from back then?

199
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,791
He was the captain,
in his senior year.

200
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,750
[RYUUICHI] Hmm...
I don't really follow catchers.

201
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,541
I mean, does anybody?

202
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,458
But Sawai... It was
only for a few games,

203
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,166
but who could ever forget?
His arm was a cannon!

204
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,416
[OOYAMA growls]

205
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,041
And I hear you've
got Keiichi Sawai's son

206
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,833
on your team! Tenth grade?

207
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,125
[OOYAMA grunts]

208
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,875
I don't know of
anybody named Sawai

209
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,291
who's in the tenth grade.

210
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,875
[OOYAMA]
'Cause his name's Tachibana.

211
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,208
[HARUKA]
Huh?

212
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,041
Souichirou Tachibana.

213
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,583
[OOYAMA] Keiichi Sawai was
Souichirou and Otomi's father

214
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,625
who passed away, sadly.

215
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,750
Was he really
that great of a pitcher?

216
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,166
[OOYAMA]
Yeah.

217
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,916
Of all the Meisei pitchers since
that championship year,

218
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,166
Sawai was number one,
hands down.

219
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,791
Oh, yeah. For sure.

220
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,333
And I would know
that fact better than anyone,

221
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,125
since I was the
catcher getting fired at

222
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,208
by that guy's cannon arm.

223
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:10,375
[RYUUICHI grunts] Uh, manager,
this one's on the house.

224
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,166
Have some kiriboshi daikon.

225
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,541
[OOYAMA]
Hmm...

Is it true?

Are these guys really
the Kenjo team?

234

They're so good.

Yeah, and their starting lineup

is mostly made up
of first years.

237

Including that guy
batting fourth,

Akai. Tomohito Akai, I think.

243
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,250
They used to be
Sumi Tech. Right?

244
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,000
[NARRATOR] That's right.
They used to be Sumi Tech.

245
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,458
[NARRATOR] In that famous
summer tournament.

246
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,125
Sumi Tech and Meisei
battled it out for the right

247
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,958
to play in Koshien.

248
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,541
[NARRATOR] Although,
these days, just like Meisei,

249
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,041
they've been in a slump,
and Koshien's been nothing

250
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,041
but a dream.

251
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,791
So, yes, that school
used to be Sumi Tech.

The Ramen Dragon master
told you, didn't he?

257
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,708
About your late
father and all that.

258
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,500
Yeah, the whole thing.

And your old man's
dashed hopes, right?

[SOUICHIROU]
Yes.

261
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,541
I see. Well, then.

262
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,458
How would you feel about trying
to become the ace pitcher?

263
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,333
Do you take him
lightly? My brother?

264
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,208
[OOYAMA]
Hmm?

265
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,958
I never saw my father pitch,

266
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,375
so I don't know how
good he really was.

267
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,333
But I have faith
that my brother

268
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,458
can take us to the championship.

269

Hmm.

Well, excuse me, then.

The Tachibana brothers.

272
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,125
[HARUKA]
They'll make it.

273
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,625
[HARUKA]
Koshien, get ready!

274
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,833
[TOUMA] It's crazy--how do you
remember practically everything

275
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,458
about that tournament, master?

276
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,166
Come on, how could I not?

277
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,416
It was the most thrilling summer
championship any of us

278
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,833
had ever witnessed, no joke!

279
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,250
I've followed 'em ever since.

280
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,208
Which is kinda weird because
I didn't even go there!

281
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,208
I mean. That must have
been quite a tournament.

282
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,583
Seriously.

283
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,541
[RYUUICHI]
Anyway, like I said before.

284
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,125
Ever since that
championship summer,

285
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,083
Meisei has had no other pitcher
anywhere near as good as...

286
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,708
"...Keiichi Sawai was." I know.

287
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,000
[RYUUICHI]
That's the truth!

288
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,250
And as a player on
Meisei's baseball team,

289
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,333
you had better not
forget it for sure!

290
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:08,208
Keiichi Sawai was
the best pitcher ever.

291
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:12,250
Got it. So... is that ramen
I ordered ready yet?

292
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,458
Aw, crap!
It's probably gone soggy,

293
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,166
but it's still good! Enjoy!

What about you? Any siblings?

314
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:15,250
[RYOU]
Yeah. I have one older brother.

315
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,125
[TOUMA] Apparently, the
older Akai's had a reputation

316
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,791
for being a great batter
ever since junior high.

317
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,416
Oh...

318
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,791
[TOUMA]
Guess it was meant to be.

319
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,541
People with older brothers
who have extraordinary

320
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:28,166
baseball talent seem to flock
to you like nobody's business.

321
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,500
[OTOMI]
Hmm?

322
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,083
First, it was the little
sister of the pitching ace

323
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,833
from the East Tokyo Tournament,

324
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:36,708
and now, the first-year cleanup
hitter's little brother.

325
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,833
I'm Japan's best
battery's little sister.

326
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:40,958
[TOUMA sighs]

327
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:50,500
[OTOMI] You know what's weird?
Mom had no clue about any of it.

328
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,875
I mean, I know when they met,

329
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,916
those days were
already long gone,

330
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,458
and I do know Dad was
never one to talk that much,

331
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,875
but it still seems odd to me.

332
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,041
[TOUMA sighs]

333
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,166
[RYUUICHI]
It was the quarterfinals of

334
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,125
the East Tokyo Tournament.

335
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,666
The other team couldn't
get any hits on him

336
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,125
up until the seventh inning.

337
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,083
But then, while he
was covering first base,

338
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,291
he collided with a runner.

339
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:14,208
His pitching arm got spiked,
he tore a ligament.

340
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,625
And that was that.

341
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,500
He would never again step out
onto the mound to pitch.

342
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,625
He stayed on the team
and he was the scorekeeper

343
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,875
until he graduated.

344
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,500
He just kept smiling, still.

345
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,875
[EISUKE] My only dream when
I was your age was to wear

346
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,291
Meisei's number one uniform.

347
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,708
And yet none of
that stuff really meant

348
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:39,000
anything to him. The ace
number was meaningless.

349
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,791
Well, regardless,
you shouldn't be

350
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,541
stealing other
people's uniforms.

351
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,250
I stole nothing,
this was my uniform!

352
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,500
After his operation,
he passed the ace number patch

353
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,166
along to me!

354
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,000
The number had become legendary,

355
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:54,000
and he gave it to me
because he was generous!

356
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,958
[TOUMA] I wouldn't go
shouting that from the rooftops.

357
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,750
Hold on. I'm not done!

358
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,708
Sawai said he thought
the uniform should be worn

359
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,250
by a senior player.

360
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,875
But, the manager said
he thought there was too big

361
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,166
a difference in talent,
and that a first year ace

362
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,708
would make for a better story,
at the end of the day.

363
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,041
Sounds like that manager
was right on the money.

364
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,208
Don't you think?

365
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,375
[OTOMI chuckles]

366
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,000
[EISUKE]
Well. That's enough about that.

367
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,333
[TOUMA] Oh, now he wants
to change the subject.

368
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,000
[EISUKE] After that,
Meisei got into a slump.

369
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,000
They were eliminated in the
first game of the tournament

370
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,333
two years in a row.

371
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,125
Their confidence tanked,
but Sawai would still

372
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,125
chant his favorite line.

373
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:34,125
"Let's go to Koshien!
Let's go to Koshien, guys!"

374
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,416
And he never stopped, not even
after he couldn't pitch anymore.

375
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,375
[EISUKE]
He just really loved baseball,

376
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,375
and he loved the Meisei baseball
team with his whole heart.

377
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,958
It's interesting
he married a woman

378
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,416
who couldn't care less
about his favorite sport.

379
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,375
But he'd be happy to know
he could have talked about it

380
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,291
at length with his two kids.

381
00:20:56,458 --> 00:21:00,833
It's true, especially
with Sou. Right?

382
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,083
I agree. He would.

383
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,083
Well, I gotta say, great story.

384
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,583
A tragic ace and
a number thief. Wow.

385
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,000
[EISUKE] I keep telling you,
I didn't steal it!

386
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,958
But don't you worry now, Touma!

387
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:16,791
You inherited some talent,
and not from me, obviously.

388
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,166
Your late mother was
an ace pitcher in her own right

389
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,583
on the softball team.

390
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,375
She finished runner-up in
the national championship!

391
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,916
Her lively pitching
style earned her

392
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,250
a pretty wonderful nickname

393
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,750
Sorry to interrupt,
but we don't wanna be late.

394
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,500
Which is why we have to
leave for practice now.

395
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,125
--[EISUKE] Hey, Sou.
--Touma, you ready?

396
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,666
--[EISUKE] I was about done.
--[TOUMA] Yeah, coming.

397
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,791
--[EISUKE] Hey.
--[OTOMI] Oh. Hey, listen.

398
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,208
About that first
year cleanup hitter.

399
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,291
You know, Akai's older brother.

400
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,708
If we keep up
this winning streak,

401
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,750
do you think we have
a chance of facing him?

402
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:45,958
[TOUMA]
Sure, we do.

403
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,458
[TOUMA] Even if we don't
keep up the streak.

404
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,750
Huh?

405
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,333
[ICHIBAN]
Next time, on Mix.

406
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,958
[OTOMI] The East Tokyo
Tournament is about to begin!

407
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:37,041
[ARISA] Ryou, here's
the book I promised you.

408
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,208
[RYOU]
Oh, thanks!

409
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,041
[OTOMI] It's finally time,
the first round!

410
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,416
[ARISA] Oh, here, Ryou.
I bought way too many snacks.

411
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,875
[RYOU]
Oh, thanks.

412
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,291
[OTOMI]
Our opponent's Kenjo High!

413
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:46,541
[ARISA]
Do you want some juice?

414
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:47,833
[RYOU]
Thanks?

415
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:50,458
[OTOMI] Hey, are you
listening? Natsuno? Hey!

416
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,666
[ICHIBAN] Next time.
"Because We're Brothers."

417
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,416
[OTOMI]
Natsuno, where are you?

418
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,666
[PUNCH barks]
