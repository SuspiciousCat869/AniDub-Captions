for the summer Koshien continue

with the East Tokyo Tournament.

00:00:35,358 --> 00:00:37,485
[NARRATOR] For the
first time in 30 years,

4
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:39,988
Meisei is a major contender,

5
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:43,408
and, because of that, people
are beginning to pay attention

6
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:47,328
to the team's progress and
support them like they used to.

7
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:51,499
[NARRATOR]
Excitement is mounting

8
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:54,502
as this team comes to life,
and people are starting

9
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:57,505
to remember the
legendary Meisei team

10
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:01,634
that won Koshien in their first
tournament 30 years prior.

11
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:05,472
[NARRATOR] All of the focus
is on the impressive,

the Tachibana brothers.

13

It's now the quarterfinals,
and if they continue to win...

14

will be waiting to face

16
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:21,363
Are they serious?

17
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:23,365
Do these jerks really
think that'll happen?

18
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:24,991

[NARRATOR] It's been 30 years
since that glorious summer,

22
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:41,174
and now, the once-triumphant
Meisei baseball team

23
00:01:41,257 --> 00:01:44,135
will be making its
electrifying return.

24

This is the story
of two brothers,

25
00:01:46,054 --> 00:01:47,722

26
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:50,600
along with their younger sister,
they face life's countless

27

aiming for the top.

28

Yep.

No upsets this time around.

39

the mercy rule again.

[KOMA]
Hmm.

41
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:40,061
[TADASHI] Their ace, Mita,
only pitched five innings.

42
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:41,521
And to add to that,

43
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:44,482
they got to play one fewer
game 'cause they're seeded.

44
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:45,859
I see how it is.

45
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:47,736
They have the advantage
of getting more rest

46
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,529
and settling their nerves.

47
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:51,698
[TADASHI] Welp, we only
have to worry about that

48
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:53,700
if we win tomorrow.

49
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:57,162
It's crazy. My whole family
is going nuts over this,

[TADASHI]
Hm?

Eh. Nobody in my family
gives a crap about baseball.

54

None of 'em.

55
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:11,551
In fact, I'm not even sure
they know I play a sport at all.

I find that hard to believe.

It's the truth, though.

My parents don't have
time to think about it.

They barely notice me.

that area was inundated with

00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,034
[RYOU'S MOTHER]
Would you do me a favor?

322
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:08,411
Can you take these bags up
to your brother's room?

323
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:10,288
You know if I go in there
without his permission,

324
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:12,665
we're only gonna end
up fighting again.

325
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:14,584
Don't worry, I'll
tell him I was the one

326
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:15,543
who brought them in there.

327
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:16,670
Please, sweetie?

328
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:18,296
This stuff is
getting in the way.

329
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,090
[COLORCASTER]
Here's the second pitch.

330
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:21,925
[RYOU]
Okay, fine.

331
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:13,560
[RYOU grunts]

332
00:19:13,643 --> 00:19:15,103
Mita?

333
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,902
If he didn't have such
good control out there,

334
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:25,697
then all of his pitches
would definitely be hittable.

335
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,658
He's consistently keeping
'em low to the ground.

336
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:31,036
[KARASHIMA grunts]

337
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:35,832
[BASE UMPIRE]
Out!

338
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:37,167
[KARASHIMA chuckles]

339
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,085
[HARUKA] Seriously! I can't
decide which is worse,

340
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:40,795
his form or his face!

341
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,715
Again, looks mean
nothing in baseball!

342
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:45,550
--[bat clinks]
--Right, Nan...

343
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:47,010
...gou?

344
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:49,512
[NANGOU]
Hm.

345
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:57,687
[CROWD cheering]

346
00:19:57,771 --> 00:19:59,397
[OOYAMA]
What did I tell ya?

347
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:02,108
Looks aren't
important out there!

348
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:05,111
They sure took the lead
pretty quickly, didn't they?

349
00:20:05,195 --> 00:20:08,782
Yeah, but in a game
like this, one run, no fun.

350
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:12,285
[NARRATOR] Second time at bat
for the Kaiou Nishi lineup.

351
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:18,792
[CROWD cheering]

352
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,169
Whaddaya know, those guys
took the lead in no time!

353
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:22,045
Scary.

354
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:23,963
Four innings with just two runs?

355
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:24,798
That's all right.

356
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:26,049
[bat clinks]

357
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:28,093
[COLORCASTER] Souichirou
Tachibana sends the ball

358
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:30,470
right between the out fielders!

359
00:20:30,553 --> 00:20:32,472
The out fielder takes too long

360
00:20:32,555 --> 00:20:35,350
and Tachibana makes it to third!

361
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:39,229
Bottom of the fourth,
still one out.

362
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:40,647
[COLORCASTER]
Cleanup hitter Imagawa

363
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,692
with a high flyball
to the outfield.

364
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:46,361
--[CROWD cheering]
--And the game's tied up again!

365
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:47,737
[EISUKE]
Yes!

366
00:20:58,832 --> 00:20:59,916
What a game.

367
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,002
This one's really
wearing me out.

368
00:21:02,085 --> 00:21:04,796
Ooyama expected it
to go down like this,

369
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:06,381
right from the start.

370
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:07,799
The main theme of today's game

371
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:10,176
is to give Touma's
throwing arm a rest.

372
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,303
Doesn't matter
if we win or lose.

373
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:13,805
Hey, hold on.

374
00:21:13,888 --> 00:21:15,432
Even if we were to beat them,

375
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:17,308
if we make the
semifinals without him,

376
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:19,436
we might as well
throw in the towel.

377
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,731
To stand half a chance
in the next pitchers' duel

378
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:26,317
we need to send Touma to
the mound in peak condition.

379
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:29,154
If we lose this one he'll have
the whole rest of the summer

380
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:31,823
to get into peak
condition. Y'know?

381
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:34,075
[OOYAMA]
I want to see it!

382
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,744
How Touma's pitching stands up

383
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:39,122
against Toushu in
a high-stakes game!

384
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:41,124
You want to see
that, too, right?

385
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:43,335
Rather than wasting him
on a mid-range opponent

386
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:44,669
like these guys,

387
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:47,172
I wanna see a tenth-grader
make a shocking debut

388
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:50,091
against the south paw that
all the pros are raving about!

389
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:52,761
I guess I see where
you're coming from, sure.

390
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,221
And I know in my heart
it's what they want, too!

391
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:58,308
The Baseball Gods want
it just as much as I do!

392
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:00,310
To see that matchup!

393
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:01,478
I see now.

394
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:03,563
[bat clinks]

395
00:22:03,646 --> 00:22:05,023
[HARUKA]
You're praying the Baseball Gods

396
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:07,108
can get us through this game.

397
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,162
[SOUICHIROU]
Next time, on <i>Mix</i> !

398
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:44,539
[TOUMA]
Summer, the ocean, and Koshien!

399
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:46,583
[SOUICHIROU] Hey, Shakespeare,
don't get ahead of yourself.

400
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:47,834
--We still have--
--[TOUMA] The semifinal

401
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:49,336
--[SOUICHIROU] Well, yeah,
--against Toushu.

402
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:51,338
but first we've gotta win
this game against Kaiou Nishi.

403
00:23:51,421 --> 00:23:52,756
[TOUMA]
I'm finally pitted against Mita!

404
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:53,798
[SOUICHIROU]
Unless we win this game,

405
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:55,300
you won't get that matchup!

406
00:23:55,383 --> 00:23:57,344
[TOUMA] If I beat him, I'll
face Nishimura in the final!

407
00:23:57,427 --> 00:23:58,470
[SOUICHIROU]
Will you listen?!

408
00:23:58,553 --> 00:24:00,347
The game continues
in the next episode!

409
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,222
[TOUMA]
Wait, it does?

410
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,515
[SOUICHIROU]
Next time, "If."

411
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,601
[TOUMA] So, the game
will be decided next time?
