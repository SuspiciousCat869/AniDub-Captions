[KOMIYAMA] That's right. I can

That's beyond impressive.

That's right, and they've

will be celebrating their
60th anniversary next year,

years they were Sumi Tech.

And, ever since

until three years ago.

112
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,333
He faced criticism for
his controversial coaching style

113

and some of the
guidance he gave,

He got into an argument
with administrators and quit,

which is when Kenjo
offered him a job.

For his first two years,
he was the assistant manager.

He personally visited junior
high schools across Tokyo

118

and made a list of
promising players.

his top choices
to transfer to Kenjo,

sleep during his lunch break.

that he's sleepy is a good sign.

Strike! You're out!

315
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,125
[KENJO SCOREKEEPER]
In this inning,

316
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,375
both teams will start
with their second batter.

317
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,208
[KENJO SCOREKEEPER]
Up to this point,

318
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,166
it's been an equal
pitcher's duel.

319
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,833
[KOMIYAMA]
Not quite equal.

320
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:13,833
Huh?

321
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,291
Not at all, in fact.

322
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,333
Compare the lineups
between pitchers.

323
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,291
Uh...

324
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:23,000
[KOMIYAMA]
Compare Kita... to that kid.

[UMPIRE 13A]
Strike! You're out!

327
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,416
Which middle
school did he go to?

328
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,416
That first-year Meisei pitcher?

329
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,125
According to this, he also
went to Meisei Junior High.

330
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,666
[KOMIYAMA]
That's odd.

331
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,583
I went to check out Meisei's
junior high team two years ago,

332
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,375
but they didn't have
a pitcher worth mentioning.

333
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,583
[PLAYER 13A]
Actually, I remember hearing

334
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,333
a rumor around that time.

335
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,416
What was it?

336
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,916
I just heard that Meisei had

337
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,916
some talented pitchers but
weren't ever allowed to pitch

338
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,458
back in those days because
some rich guy insisted

339
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,125
that his kid had to be the ace.

340
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,250
An ace pitcher who was only
there because of his father?

341
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,916
Oh, now that you mention it...

342
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,125
I seem to remember a ninth
grade ace who acted big,

343
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,291
but his ego didn't
match his talent.

Huh?

00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,416
Wait, do you actually
have a cold?

347
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,291
[DAISUKE] No, just had
something caught in my throat.

[SOUICHIROU] I thought I told
you that wasn't allowed.

354
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:32,416
[sighs] Is there some
kind of punishment for it?

355
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah.

356
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,083
[TOUMA sighs]

357
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,625
Now you had
better get a strikeout.

[TOUMA] I'd better get
a strikeout, he says.

Great.

call that a punishment.
