00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,803
[NARRATOR] It's the first
game of the semifinals

2
00:00:21,886 --> 00:00:26,224
in the East Tokyo Tournament.
A trip to Koshien's on the line.

6
00:00:38,153 --> 00:00:40,822
[NARRATOR] It's been 30 years
since that glorious summer.

7
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:43,908
And now, the once-triumphant
Meisei baseball team

8
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:46,369
will be making its
electrifying return.

9
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:49,497
[NARRATOR] This is the
story of two brothers,

10
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:51,458
a pitcher and a catcher.

11
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,251
Along with their younger
sister, they face

12
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:56,338
life's countless adventures
while aiming for the top.

13
00:00:56,421 --> 00:01:00,759
The three share one goal:
Get to the Koshien Tournament!

[CROWD cheers]

15
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:42,777
[MORI] Meisei High School's
tenth-grade pitcher,

16
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:44,195
Touma Tachibana.

17
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:48,742
[TOUMA grunts]

18
00:02:49,826 --> 00:02:53,163
[MORI] And here is tenth-grade
catcher, Souichirou Tachibana.

19
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:56,166
Fun fact, he and his brother
Touma share a birthday.

20
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:59,210
[HYOURI] I see,
that's pretty interesting.

21
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:00,879
Like hot springs're
known for eggs,

22
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:02,339
Meisei is known for twins.

23
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:04,049
That's just how it is, you know?

24

[MORI growls]

25
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:08,428
Well, as I'm sure
the majority of our viewers

26
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:11,389
are already aware,
these two aren't actually

27
00:03:11,473 --> 00:03:13,850
fully biological brothers.

28
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:15,560
They're not?

29
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:18,355
[MORI] It's the second
marriage for both parents.

30
00:03:18,438 --> 00:03:20,106
While that in and
of itself isn't

31
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,566
anything particularly unusual.

32
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:24,069
But considering the fact that
both boys happened to be

33
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:26,237
born on the same day,

34
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,199
you get a sense that it was
all meant to be somehow.

35
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,375
Sounds like a novel.

36
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,835
Meant to be, huh? Oh, well.

37
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,463
Hey, speaking of birthdays,
I was born on the same day

--as the famous Hachiro--

And he hits the fourth
pitch but it's a soft hit,

40
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:48,343

00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:51,096
Right fielder, Koma, runs in
and makes the catch.

Hmm.

[TSUKIKAGE] Oh. So you
weren't joking, after all.

[MAYUMI]
Sorry?

47
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:17,455
[MORI] With one out, Mita, ninth
up to bat, connects ball to bat.

48
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:19,207
And it splits the
outfield defense.

49
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,500
That's a double.

50
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,002
The first extra-base
hit of the game

51
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:25,213
goes to Toushu pitcher Mita,
the team's star.

52
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:27,632
That's one out,
runner on second.

53
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:29,592
[SOUICHIROU]
I see what's up.

54
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:31,511
Your plan is to force him
to run around the bases

55
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:35,390
in order to tire him out, right?
I can't that say I'm impressed.

56
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:37,017
Come on, gimme a break.

57
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,894
I lost control of the pitch
and it drifted a little high.

58
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:41,438
First time this game!

59
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:44,024
So, listen!

60
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:45,859
From here on out, you
better include any mistakes

61
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:47,902
I might make in
your calculations.

62
00:04:47,986 --> 00:04:49,571
You're not the boss of me.

Keep your guard up.

00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:55,994
Let's avoid getting
a runner on third

when we only have one out.

It's not gonna happen.

the steal, but gets tagged out

in the scorching heat!

was gonna try to steal third!

a buncha dumb luck.

to rounding the bases,

that double and then

312
00:16:53,336 --> 00:16:54,713
None.

313
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:57,841
[HARUKA] Okay, but that's
nothing to cry about, jeez.

314
00:16:57,924 --> 00:16:59,467
[OOYAMA]
Have you forgotten?

315
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,971
Every year in front of the TV,
even if it was a game between

316
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:04,889
two teams I didn't know,

317
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:07,642
no matter how lopsided
the score might be...

318
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,145
...I would always cry when
I'd hear the siren signaling

319
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:11,771
the end of the game.

320
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:13,982
Getting to see a game
like this up close?

321
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:16,192
It's over. Niagra Falls.

322
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:17,527
[sobs]

323
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,697
Yeah, but the game isn't
finished yet, you know!

324
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:26,244
[OOYAMA]
Souichirou. I'm replacing Touma.

325
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:28,705
My lack of preparation
is to blame.

326
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:32,250
I was happy just being hired to
coach my old high school team.

327
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:33,960
I was in over my head.

328
00:17:34,044 --> 00:17:36,171
I came in without
a firm grasp of the strengths

329
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:38,048
and temperaments
of all the players.

330
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:41,551
I owe the seniors
a huge apology.

331
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:43,345
I wanted a competitive team.

332
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:47,349
Next year, and the one after,
so I neglected you guys.

333
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:48,350
I'm sorry.

334
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:51,311
It's okay.
That was the right call.

335
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:53,355
If we keep going like this,

336
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:55,899
we'll just be waiting
for Touma to burn out.

337
00:17:55,982 --> 00:17:57,233
Hmm?

338
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:58,693
Where is he?

339
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:03,490
[SOUICHIROU] He's on the
mound, getting warmed up.

340
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:06,659
But he's way past
his limit. Isn't he?

341
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:09,788
[SOUICHIROU]
Yeah. But, from what I can see,

342
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:11,706
he may have just leveled up.

343
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,874
[OOYAMA]
Hmm?

344
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:15,001
--[SOUICHIROU] Manager.
--Ah?

345
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:18,797
Please, sir. Leave Touma to me.

346
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,675
He's not about
to break down yet.

347
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:23,677
Thanks to Mita
raising the bar consistently

348
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,388
out there, before
we even knew it,

349
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:27,889
Touma was playing
beyond his limits

350
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:30,558
and getting better
in the process.

351
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,477
I need you to trust me.

352
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,853
I promise you.

353
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:36,314
I'll throw in the towel
before he breaks down.

354
00:18:37,524 --> 00:18:39,734
One, two, and...

355
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,361
Three! Strikes.

356
00:18:41,444 --> 00:18:45,448
[MORI] That's 20! Monster Hiroki
is a thing to be feared!

357
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:46,825
[CROWD cheers]

358
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:50,787
We've got to respond with
that kind of pitching.

359
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,956
[MORI] Meisei High School
was still unable to score

360
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,125
in the top of the tenth inning.

361
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,003
Now Toushu hopes to
score in the bottom half.

362
00:18:58,086 --> 00:18:59,838
And if they can,
the game ends there,

363
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:02,424
and they'll earn
a spot in the final.

364
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:03,883
After pitching nine innings.

365
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:07,178
Meisei High School's tenth
grade ace, Touma Tachibana,

366
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:09,931
heads back out to
the mound once again.

367
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,391
Just checking the stats.

368
00:19:11,474 --> 00:19:14,060
Apparently, it's been three
years since the last time

369
00:19:14,144 --> 00:19:16,563
a single pitcher kept Toushu
from scoring through

370
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:19,441
nine innings in
an official game.

371
00:19:27,532 --> 00:19:29,451
So, I'll ask you one more time.

372
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:32,454
What're some of Tachibana's
good qualities as a pitcher?

373
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:34,789
Wha--?! Gimme a second.

374
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:35,915
Let's see, good qualities.

375
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:38,168
Uh, his sparkling
personality, maybe?

376
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:39,753
Look, my editor
told me to just ignore

377
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:41,755
deadlines and stuff, so...

378
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:45,258
Huh...?
Now. Touma turns to his team.

379
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:47,635
It seems like he's trying to get
them pumped up or something.

380
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,890
[TOUMA] Mix the anime is
playing on TV to great reviews!

381
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:53,975
Are we sure he
hasn't broken down?

382
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,393
Because...

383
00:19:57,103 --> 00:20:01,066
[MORI] Wow. Tachibana also
throws his fastest pitch today.

384
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,943
But it misses, slightly,
and he walks the batter.

385
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:06,071
I don't know what
to feel right now.

386
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:08,365
Should I be glad or worried?

387
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:10,283
For the time being...

388
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,077
...let's settle for surprised.

389
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,038
[MORI]
They've got runners on base.

390
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:17,248
And they've moved them
into scoring position!

391
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:19,209
[sighs]

392
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:20,460
[MORI]
Here's the pitch.

393
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,300
[PLATE UMPIRE 22A]
Out!

394
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:30,178
[MORI] The Meisei battery won't
let them get that next hit!

395
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,642
When we played,

396
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:39,062
you were the only one who was
able to score runs against me.

397
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:40,772
[AKAI]
Hmm.

398
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:45,902
[ARISA]
What's so funny?

399
00:20:45,985 --> 00:20:49,823
[AKAI] Don't you feel anything?
Watching your brother pitch?

400
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,076
Before he started
playing baseball,

401
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:54,619
we were inseparable.

402
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:58,623
Everyone talked about it.
How well we used to get along.

403
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:01,209
Unlike you and
your brother, right?

404
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:05,630
[AKAI] Speaking of which...
Is Ryou here?

405
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:07,048
Cheering Meisei on?

406
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,300
[ARISA] The soccer team
is at a training camp.

407
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:10,719
You didn't even know that?

408
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:15,765
[ARISA] All he ever does
these days is play baseball.

409
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:18,476
You know at first,
my parents used to tell him

410
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,061
to hang out with me.

411
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:23,440
They said we were supposed
to spend time together.

412
00:21:23,523 --> 00:21:24,941
[TAKESHITA grunts]

413
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:26,901
[MITA'S MOTHER] Whoo! That's
another strikeout, Darling!

414
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,821
[laughs] Dear, you should
maybe calm down a bit.

415
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:31,406
Hiroki! You're doing great!

416
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:33,116
But ever since they
realized how much potential

417
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:35,410
he has, they've been nuts.

418
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:38,371
And they say, "Don't
get in the way of his practice!"

419
00:21:38,455 --> 00:21:40,248
Or, "Stay out of trouble!
You wouldn't want to

420
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:42,125
embarrass your brother!"

00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,587
I've lost all of the
freedom I used to enjoy.

422
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,422
[AKAI] That's why he
wants you to watch him.

Huh?

Hiroki.

[HYOURI]
This sure has been a long one.

That's extra innings for ya.

We're in extra innings now!

up to 15 of those!

is this game gonna last?

and have to play a rematch?

finish this here for sure!

that with such certainty?

Yeah! How?
