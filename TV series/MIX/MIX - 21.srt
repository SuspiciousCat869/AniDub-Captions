the game in the last inning.

And there's the first pitch!

since that glorious summer.

Meisei baseball team

electrifying return.

This is the story

interesting part.

They haven't used
their ace pitcher.

And strike three!

What?

24
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:07,635
[COLORCASTER] Up to bat is
left fielder, Touma Tachibana.

[MITA]
Don't you want to see him pitch?

If we played them, you could
see his form up close again.

27
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:17,687
If we do end up playing Meisei,
we'd use our official lineup,

Regardless of who we play,

But that kid gives
me the creeps.

that as a compliment?

I wonder,

44
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,158
could having Souichirou pitch
in this game be an option?

Nope.

We can't afford
to take Souichirou

off his catcher position.

48

The cost of doing that would
greatly outweigh the benefits.

Without him acting as
the backbone of the team,

161
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,209
That kind of stuff
is necessary, once in a while.

What're those?

00:09:57,003 --> 00:09:58,630
Business cards.

165
00:09:58,713 --> 00:10:01,424
I got 'em from some
supposed alumni.

166
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:02,801
There was a company president,

167
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:05,804
some general manager,
an editor, and a legislator.

168
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:08,181
I kept having to meet
these random fancy old guys

169
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:09,974
and pose for photo ops.

170
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:13,103
It's starting to get
in the way of practice!

171
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:14,354
[TOUMA sighs]

172
00:10:14,437 --> 00:10:17,399
[TADASHI] Yeah. I guess
that's just how it goes.

173
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,526
If we do end up making
it into the Koshien,

174
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:21,027
the school's gonna
need the funding.

175
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:24,197
That means we gotta do whatever
we can to keep 'em happy,

176
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,492
so for the school's sake,
just keep playin' along.

177
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:29,369
Fine, I'll do what I have to do.

178
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:32,205
But they should do their
research before jumping the gun.

179
00:10:32,288 --> 00:10:35,959
Excuse me, Touma!
Do you have a second?

180
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:38,294
[TADASHI] Looks like those
guys are next in line.

181
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:39,295
Better hurry.

[PUNCH barking]

184
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:50,432
[MAN A] Touma, please!
Just a moment of your time!

185
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:52,851
Wait. Where'd he go?

186
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:53,935
Hmm?

187
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:56,771
[TADASHI]
Huh, what's that?

188
00:10:57,897 --> 00:10:59,983
Souichirou, where's Tou?

189
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:02,527
I told him to duck out
and go for a run.

190
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,778
Good call, right?

191
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:06,114
Uh-huh. Good call.

192
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:07,323
One question though.

193
00:11:07,407 --> 00:11:09,784
How'd he get away
completely unnoticed?

194
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:12,454
Touma was practically
surrounded.

195
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:15,040
It's pretty simple.

196
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:16,249
Since we live next door,

197
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:17,876
the school has basically
been our playground

198
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,754
since we were little and
we'd sneak in all the time.

199
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:23,840
We know this whole place
like the back of our hands.

200
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:27,093
Which means we also know
the secret ways outta here.

Mm?

203
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,563
Be careful when you're
riding with the dog!

204
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:41,941
He's in the basket. It's fine.

205
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:43,693
He's too fat for that basket.

What's the matter?

211
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:05,340
Is that freshman prodigy
of yours in a slump already?

212
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:07,092
Ah, good to see ya.

213
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:09,135
He's having some
trouble bouncing back,

214
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:11,680
but his dream was shattered,
so I can't blame him.

215
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:14,641
He'll have more chances in the
next two years, so it's fine.

216
00:12:14,724 --> 00:12:15,892
[KOMIYAMA grunts]

217
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:18,144
You're assuming that
his dream was Koshien,

218
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:19,896
but that isn't the case.

219
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:21,272
Really?

220
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:23,191
[KOMIYAMA] Ever since
he was in elementary school,

221
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:25,819
his goal has always
been Hiroki Mita.

222
00:12:25,902 --> 00:12:29,531
The same Hiroki Mita
that goes to Toushu?

223
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:31,783
That boy idolized Mita.

224
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:33,368
And hoped that one day

225
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:37,372
he could face those pitches head
on and swing with all he had.

226
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:39,624
This year was his only chance,

227
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:40,875
and now it's gone.

228
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,127
[OOKUMA]
No, it's not!

229
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,879
Hey, it's not like
the guy died or anything.

230
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:47,424
Ya never know, the two
of them could end up going pro

231
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:49,718
and playing against each
other in the big leagues.

232
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:52,470
I'm afraid the solution
isn't that simple.

233
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:56,266
Counting the Sumi Tech days,
it's been almost 60 years,

234
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:59,811
and only one student's gone
pro, y'know what I'm saying?

235
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:01,187
I see your point.

236
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:04,149
That one pro never got
promoted to the first league,

237
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:07,068
and his career ended
after a measly two years.

238
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:08,570
[KOMIYAMA]
It wasn't that bad.

239
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:10,780
Things would've been fine
if he didn't have that injury.

240
00:13:10,864 --> 00:13:13,742
That injury was a result
of him trying to reach too far

241
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:16,286
and achieve more
than he was capable of.

242
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,329
The truth is, there was
only one player

243
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:20,540
who was significantly
better than me,

244
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:23,460
and he was Sumi Tech's
one, true genius.

is waiting for you!

got there is without a doubt

this team has ever had.

so what brings you here?

My dog. We were out here
taking him for a walk,

but then he got off his leash
and ran in this direction.

So? What's your point?

Point is, the better I do,
the better it reflects on you

00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:11,461
This is ridiculous.

What are you talking about?

317
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:18,635
He just doesn't like to open up.

318
00:16:18,718 --> 00:16:19,803
I wonder why?

319
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:21,388
Eh, who knows.

320
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:23,098
[OTOMI]
Hm? Hmm?

321
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,225
Hey, Touma? Where's Punch?

322
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:26,643
Huh?

[NARRATOR] The East Tokyo

324
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:36,695
Meisei High School versus
Toushu High School.

325
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:41,282
The game everyone's been waiting
for begins tomorrow morning.

[NISHIMURA]
You have got to be kidding me!

327
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:46,788
I told you! There's
another semifinal game!

328
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:47,914
Hold on.

329
00:16:47,997 --> 00:16:49,332

Hey, Otomi!

333
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,024
Gimme a sec,
and I'll be ready to go!

334
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:15,692
Yeah, okay!

335
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,693
Hm?

336
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:20,947
Hey mom, are you sure you don't
wanna come to the game with us?

337
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:23,908
Someone has to stay back
and keep an eye on the house.

338
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:25,452
Especially after
one of the neighbors

339
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:27,996
had their place
broken into recently.

340
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,832
I have trouble keeping
track of the rules anyway,

341
00:17:30,915 --> 00:17:34,169
so watching it on TV with
the commentary is better for me.

342
00:17:34,252 --> 00:17:36,921
Don't worry, and just
go enjoy yourself!

343
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,343
[MAYUMI] The three of us
will be here rooting for them.

344
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,805
Right! Now let's go, yeah!

345
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:48,892
Don't you need to be in
disguise, Dad? Or am I wrong?

346
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:51,353
Don't you worry about that!

347
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:56,441
Because today is Sunday,
all across the nation! [laughs]

Now, the time has come.

The East Tokyo
Tournament Semifinal.

351
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:05,367
It's the game between
Meisei High School

352
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,327
and Toushu High School.

353
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,538
[COLORCASTER] Behind the first
base dugout, third base dugout,

354
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:13,708
even behind home plate, there's
not an empty seat in the house!

355
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,752
[HYOURI] It's only because
of the media attention

356
00:18:15,835 --> 00:18:17,879
on top of today's
being a Sunday.

357
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:20,090
The media jumps on a better
than average freshman,

358
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:21,591
and blows things
out of proportion.

359
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:24,010
They've been pulling
this stunt for years.

360
00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:26,971
It's a nice story,
but it doesn't seem to mention

361
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:28,431
that Meisei was
on the receiving end

362
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:31,267
of Mita's perfect practice game
before the tournament.

363
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:33,103
Oh, did that really happen?

364
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:34,354
But there's nothing
about it here

365
00:18:34,437 --> 00:18:37,273
in the information that
was submitted by Meisei.

366
00:18:37,357 --> 00:18:39,693
Of course not, since
that manager of theirs

367
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:42,028
likes to pretend that
whole debacle never happened.

368
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:44,739
They're the sloppiest
baseball team I've ever seen,

369
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:45,990
just a mess.

370
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:48,284
As far as the
first-years are concerned,

371
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:51,079
Nishimura from Seinan
is a much better player,

372
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:52,706
but he's not popular
with the masses,

373
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:54,541
so he doesn't get
any of the attention.

374
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:56,251
I see.

375
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:59,045
So, let me just
spell it out for you.

376
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:01,047
There's only a single
aspect of the game

377
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:03,133
that's gonna be
interesting to watch,

378
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:05,552
and that's how bad
Meisei's gonna lose.

379
00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:07,220
[ASSISTANT DIRECTOR]
On air in five minutes!

380
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:10,181
They'll all regret making
it this far in the tournament.

381
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:12,517
And after they get torn
apart, limb from limb,

382
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,602
they'll never wanna
play baseball again!

383
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,688
[chuckles]

384
00:19:21,735 --> 00:19:22,861
[KOMA]
Well?

385
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:25,321
What do ya make of that
ace pitcher of theirs?

386
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:27,782
[SOUICHIROU] Hard to say
by watching the warm up.

387
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,368
[KOMA] Yeah, but can you tell
if he's having an off-day?

388
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:33,163
Any pitcher can have
one of those, right?

389
00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:34,497
Yeah, maybe,

390
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:36,875
but look at all those
scouts in the crowd.

391
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,669
Even if he did have an off-day,
I doubt we'd notice.

392
00:19:39,753 --> 00:19:41,087
He'd still be good
enough for the pros

393
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:43,465
to be paying attention
to him regardless.

394
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,302
[SOUICHIROU] It all depends
on Touma at this point.

395
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:49,471
How badly we lose is up to him.

00:19:51,264 --> 00:19:52,682
What was that for?

For you giving up before
the game's even begun!

Yeah, right!

400
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:57,979
I'm only saying those things

401
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,190
to get Touma in
the right headspace.

402
00:20:00,273 --> 00:20:03,485
I know him better than anyone,
and that's what works.

00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,573
[HARUKA]
You sure about that?

Stop it! Wait!

they're as easy goin' as ever.

went a second ago.

[COLORCASTER]
All right, then.

424
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,246
After some respectful
greetings by the two teams,

425
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:57,706
the starting members of Toushu,

426
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,417
who are batting in the bottom
half, take to the field.

427
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,043
The stands are packed today,

428
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:06,464
the crowd is ready to see
this highly anticipated match.

429
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:08,758
This game features
the prodigy from Toushu,

430
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:11,678
the left-handed,
ace pitcher, Hiroki Mita!

431
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:14,681
It won't be easy to score
against this pitcher.

432
00:21:14,764 --> 00:21:17,809
He hasn't given up a single run
in the entire tournament.

433
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:20,562
Together with their powerful
lineup, this flawless team

434
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:23,523
has their eyes set on
the National Championship.

435
00:21:23,606 --> 00:21:26,192
Many have considered Toushu
to be the overwhelming favorite

436
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:28,153
to win the tournament
from the very beginning.

437
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:30,071
I wouldn't be too
sure about that.

438
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,406
Much like any game,

439
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:33,575
you won't be sure of
the outcome until it's over!

440
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:35,035
So, keep an open mind!

441
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:37,328
The resurgence of Meisei
is nothing to scoff at,

442
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:38,913
so don't underestimate them!

443
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,875
Keep an eye on the first-year
ace pitcher, Touma Tachibana.

444
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,003
There's something special about
that kid, I can just feel it!

445
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:47,464
So, I'm sure we'll be treated
to an exhilarating game!

446
00:21:47,547 --> 00:21:49,007

the other semifinal!

456

the monstrous Hiroki Mita.

[HARUKA] How can our
freshman ace compete with him?

There is another freshman ace,
