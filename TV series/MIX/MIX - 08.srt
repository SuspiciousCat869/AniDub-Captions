Why would he tell
you to wait here?

he's very talented.

160
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,333
His sister's in
my homeroom class,

161
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,125
and she's always bragging
about how great he is.

162
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,375
Oh, yeah? What position?

163
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,208
Huh? Uh, well...

164
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,083
[MITA]
He's a catcher.

165
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:14,416
His brother's a pitcher, and
they're a great sibling battery.

166
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,166
[REPORTER 08A]
I see. So, you've heard of 'em.

167
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,083
I was watching for
that no-hitter at last year's

168
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,916
junior high tournament in Tokyo.

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,166
It was pretty impressive,
to say the least.

170
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,666
Some great pitching,
and you led the way nicely.

171
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,166
'Preciate it.

172
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,166
Yeah, it must
have been impressive.

173
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,500
Had to be, for a star
like Mita to remember.

174
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,666
Guess we'll keep an eye out
for you two this year.

175
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,166
The Tachibana brothers
of Meisei, was it?

176
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,541
[SOUICHIROU]
Uh, yeah.

177
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,250
But, to be frank, we're still
only in tenth grade.

178
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,250
If you'll excuse me.

179
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,500
That means nothing.

180
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,000
I've been my team's
ace since I was your age.

181
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,958
Your grade's irrelevant
out on the field.

182
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,291
[SOUICHIROU grunch]

183
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,541
Would it kill you
to brag a little more?

184
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,500
Sorry?

185
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,791
You're in a totally
different league than him.

186
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,291
Why show him such respect?

187
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,666
[MITA]
Idiot. You should be quiet.

188
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,833
Come on. You've never even
seen me pitch a single game.

189
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,125
That's because
I don't even like baseball.

190
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,375
It's boring.

191
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,583
Then shut your mouth.
You're embarrassing me.

192
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,875
But they're nowhere
near as good as you!

193
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,166
You're a celebrity, in
newspapers and magazines!

194
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,041
The best high
school pitcher ever!

195
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,041
[MITA] You know I don't
care about that stuff!

196
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,750
Print's dead anyway

197
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,791
Oh. I mean no offense.

198
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,708
[BOTH]
It's okay, none taken.

199
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,625
[MITA]
How about this?

200
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,333
When the summer
tournament starts,

201
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,833
come to a game and see me pitch.

202
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,250
All I ask is one game,

203
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,625
but you have to watch it
from start to finish.

204
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,625
By the end, I'll turn
you into a baseball fanatic.

205
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,833
So, how'd everything
go over there?

206
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,416
How was that
nasty girl's famous brother?

207
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:58,375
Went well. Now I really
want his autograph.

208
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,583
[OOYAMA]
Dang! Rain tagged me out

209
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,166
right before I hit home base.

210
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,875
[HARUKA]
Yeah this rain's crazy!

211
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,583
I'm glad I went
shopping earlier.

212
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,750
Come to think of it.

213
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,250
I wonder if Nan
made it home okay.

214
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,916
He lives pretty far.

215
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,416
With family in Saitana.

216
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,708
So, you're right,
that's quite a trek.

217
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,541
I'm surprised his parents
in Kyushu let him move.

218
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,500
Tokyo's nothing like Kyushu.

219
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,125
They've got so many
other kids to keep track of.

220
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,958
And besides, when he
gets an idea in his head,

221
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,875
he won't back down.

222
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,291
[HARUKA] He really wants to pay
you back for what you did.

223
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,166
It's kind of sweet.

224
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,875
Yeah, it is endearing.

225
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:44,708
It rained like this,
the day all that happened.

226
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,250
Ah! Forgot my pants again!

227
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,166
[PUNCH barks]

228
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:55,958
[PUNCH barks]

229
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:58,625
[HARUKA giggles]

230
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:04,875
[OOYAMA] That tall lefty, he's
got a 93 mile-an-hour fast ball.

231
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,583
[OOYAMA]
His slider drops off a cliff.

232
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,708
Then there's his
two-seam fast ball.

233
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,583
Every pitch is top-notch.

234
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,333
I can't believe
he's in high school.

235
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,750
I mean, a regular
teenage boy could never

236
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,916
stand a chance against
pitches like that.

237
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,333
[TOUMA]
They're a great team.

238
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,458
Quarter-finalists at
the Summer Koshien,

239
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,541
and they have an
incredible ace pitcher.

240
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,875
Why would they be slumming
a practice game against us?

241
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,833
What do you mean
"slumming"?! Come on!

242
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,833
They only made it
to the quarter-finals!

243
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,875
We've been the
national champions!

244
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,541
The best team in Japan!

245
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,750
[TOUMA] Yeah, but that
happened 30 years ago.

246
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,000
Might as well be yesterday!

247
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,583
It's ancient history.

248
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,166
[KOMA]
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

249
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,250
[SOUICHIROU] He's doing it all
to impress his younger sister.

250
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,875
Huh?

251
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,250
[SACHIE, YOSHIKO]
What?!

252
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,000
[YOSHIKO]
Arisa, he's your brother?

253
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,000
[ARISA]
That's right.

254
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,291
[SACHIE]
The hero from Koshien!

255
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,875
[YOSHIKO] Hiroki Mita, who's
being scouted by the pros?

256
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,291
[ARISA] Is he really
as good as they say?

257
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,250
Oh, my brother, I mean.

258
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,541
Sure, as far as I can tell.

259
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,250
Then I really do have
the right to brag about him.

260
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,208
The way you brag about yours?

261
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,333
Yeah. I suppose you do.

262
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,458
[SOUICHIROU]
From what Natsuno tells me,

263
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:20,333
Arisa considers Otomi
to be a major rival.

264
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,125
At least for the moment.

265
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,750
Otomi has the upper hand,
but that could change

266
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,666
before we know it.

267
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,041
[SOUICHIROU] And today, a
practice game has been arranged

268
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,166
between the two teams,
making it a showdown

269
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,833
between the two girls.

270
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,458
[TOUMA] I think the whole thing
is ridiculous. Don't you?

271
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,833
[SOUICHIROU]
No. We should be grateful.

272
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:37,958
We're getting a chance
to play against

273
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,291
a superhuman
high-school pitcher.

274
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,083
A rare opportunity.

275
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,291
Even though
it's gonna make things

276
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,083
uncomfortable for Otomi.

277
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,541
[SOUICHIROU]
It isn't like that.

278
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,833
I don't think it'll bother Otomi
one way or the other.

279
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,000
[gasps]

280
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,875
So? You think we'll
get a chance to play?

281
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,500
Finally?

282
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,583
[SOUICHIROU sighs]

283
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,916
[TAKESHITA grunts]

284
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,958
[ARISA] Huh? What about
the famous sibling "battery"?

285
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,125
Well both of them
are only in the tenth grade.

286
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,208
Is that so, my brother
tells me he was already

287
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,833
the team's ace pitcher by the
time he was in tenth grade.

288
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:19,833
[YOSHIKO]
What?

289
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,333
Oh, wow!

290
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,750
[ARISA]
Is that really as impressive...

291
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,958
[ICHIBAN] So, you're going
to let her talk like that?

292
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,625
[OTOMI] Not like I have
anything to say back to her.

293
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,583
For the time being, that is.

294
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,875
But we'll see.

295
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,708
[OOYAMA]
Takeshita will start.

296
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,083
Second time through
the lineup, it's Takaoka.

297
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:38,208
On the third time through, we'll
put in the younger Tachibana.

298
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,333
Then we'll finish it
out with Nojima.

299
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,875
Before they get
used to a pitcher's style,

300
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,208
we'll put in a new one,
which will throw them off.

301
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,000
Doing that will
disrupt their rhythm.

302
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,375
There's no restrictions on

303
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,500
how many player
replacements we get.

304
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,375
Which goes to show that
they've totally written us off.

305
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,500
Let's teach them what
happens when you underestimate

306
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,250
former national high school
baseball champions!

307
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,083
Again, that was a different
team and 30 years ago.

308
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,083
[OOYAMA]
Right! You ready to win this?

309
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,458
[PLAYERS]
Yeah!

310
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,625
[chatterin]

311
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,916
[UMPIRE 08A]
Play ball!

312
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,791
[TOUMA]
I'm third up.

313

this that seriously?

Of course he is.

Why do you think

Seems so unlike him.

323
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,083
Usually, when he pitches,

something really nasty.

using their backup guys.

But, instead, they're going
with their starting lineup.

One thing about Takaoka.

When he pitches more
than one inning, he can

turn into a completely different
pitcher out of the blue.

Takaoka does exactly that.

He walks consecutive batters,

and loads the bases with
no outs, at which point,

00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,375
Moron.

471
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,958
[TOUMA]
Moron?

472
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,958
There're two outs
in the sixth inning,

473
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,708
and Nojima's the only
pitcher we have remaining.

474
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,958
[TOUMA] What's that sign
supposed to mean?

475
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,708
[SOUICHIROU]
It's totally obvious.

476
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,875
I mean, come on--what manager
in their right mind would pull

477
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,458
a pitcher who's been
out there pitching no-hitters?

478
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,708
Against the starting lineup of
an all-star team, no less.

479
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:35,916
This is only a fluke,

480
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,125
he won't be able to keep
pitching no-hitters.

481
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,416
Even against the same batters,

482
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,791
his arm's gonna start
getting fatigued.

483
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:45,625
That's the reality of facing
a national-level team.

Big news, guys! Big news!

488
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,958
[TOUMA]
What's with you, Natsuno?

489
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,458
[SOUICHIROU]
Why're you so worked up?

490
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,625
[ICHIBAN] It's a big deal!
This is huge, huge, I tell ya!

491
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:40,958
[TOUMA]
We know, man, what is it?

492
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,291
[SOUICHIROU]
Spill it, dude.

493
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,083
[ICHIBAN] It's incredible.
I can't even believe it!

494
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,500
This is the biggest news
I've heard in

495
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:46,833
I don't even know how long!

Out with it!

[SOUICHIROU]
Stop wasting our time.

[ICHIBAN] Look, okay,
l-like, check it out--
