A long, long time ago...

00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,500
[NARRATOR]
...the two kids who were

3
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:15,916
stranded in the mountains,
unable to get home...

4
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:20,750
[NARRATOR] ...were saved by the
Seinan High School Team bus.

00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,500
Or, so the story goes.

6

a walk. That right?

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,250
Uh-huh.

00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,833

all the way out here,

9
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,791
alone with a girl, when
it's pitch black outside?

10
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,500
What do you guys want me to say?

11
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,041
We didn't know the bus
wasn't running today,

12
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,666
and we got stranded.

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,416
[ISAMI] Then what's your
relationship? You two dating?

14

We're childhood friends.

15

[ISAMI]
Mm-hmm.

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,583

It's gotten pretty late,
and I want to call my parents

And now, the once-triumphant
Meisei baseball team

38
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,125
will be making its
electrifying return.

39
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,041
[NARRATOR] This is the
story of two brothers,

40
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,000
a pitcher and a catcher.

41
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,875
Along with their younger
sister, they face

42

life's countless adventures
while aiming for the top.

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,916
The three share one goal:
Get to the Koshien Tournament!

44
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,916
Hello? Tachibana house.

45
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,041
Tou, thank goodness!

Huh? Tanuki?

Take out the "Te" and "Ke"?
I don't get it.

00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,125
I should be home
in about an hour or so.

All of Japan'll be

when the summer Koshien starts.

63
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,416
Y'know, the guy who became
the ace pitcher of Seinan

64
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,208
in his first year
of high school.

65
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,500
So, check it out,
we had an away game today.

66
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,875
I had a shutout of course,

67
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,625
but they got two whole
hits on me!

68
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,500

76
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,083
[TOUMA]
He outclassed us in every way.

[TOUMA]
We got destroyed.

78

[ISAMI] Hmm, maybe...
But that's not all.

79
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,791
I also heard you pitched
seven straight innings.

80
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,208
And with you on the mound,
Toushu got zero runs

81
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,625
and only two hits.

82
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:08,708
Well, you're not wrong,
but it was only a practice game.

83
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,625
[ISAMI]
Oh, and don't you forget it.

84
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,083
The difference
between an official game

85
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,666
and a practice game
is like night and day.

[NISHIMURA] Wait, no!
It says I have service.

87
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,333
Why's is it disconnecting then?
It starts ringing, then, poof!

88
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,625
It sounds like you've been
keeping your eye on them.

89
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,791
Is there any particular
reason for that?

90
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,625
Hah! Just thinking it'd
be nice to face them

91
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,166
at the summer
tournament for a change.

92
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,833
But obviously,
that's just wishful thinking.

93
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,250
Because every year, by the
time we reach the third round,

94
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,416
Meisei High has already
been eliminated.

95

This year'll be the same.

96
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,291
Don't worry about that.

97
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,958
They won't be
eliminated this time.

00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,625
[VETERINARIAN 11A]
Seems pretty cut and dry.

159
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,041
He's suffering from
heat exhaustion.

160
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,458
[OTOMI] But it's not even
the hottest time of the year.

161
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,500
[VETERINARIAN 11A]
Then he must be eating too much.

162
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,375
[OTOMI]
What do you mean, "then"?

163
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,916
Can you please just
actually check on him?

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,750
He's been looking exhausted
and won't make a sound,

165
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,250
no matter what I do!

166
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,875
[VETERINARIAN 11A]
Not to worry.

167
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,208
When he gets hungry,
he'll start barking.

168
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,958
Based on that belly and
the greedy look on his face,

169
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,750
there's no doubt in my mind!

170
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,750
He's been eating too much!

171
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,416
Okay, we're done here.

172
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,083
[OTOMI]
Gimme a break.

173
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,333
If something bad happens to
Punch, I'm gonna sue that guy.

174
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,541
[OOYAMA]
Hmm?

175
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,708
[HARUKA] It just came out.
I hear it's selling well.

176
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,541
Do I really have to tell you not
to have her over while I'm away?

177
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,791
What's the problem?

178
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,875
It's not like you got
divorced or anything.

179
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,500
You're just not living together.

180
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,041
Yeah, well, she's
the one who wanted

181
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,875
to move out so bad! And you
remember what she said to me?

182
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,916
Seeing my face every day, all
she could write were comedies!

183
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,666
C'mon, Mom's talented!

184
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,166
And that's not all she said.

185
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,458
Remember? She said that if she
didn't pursue her talent,

186
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,375
she'd regret it
for the rest of her life.

187
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,958
And I don't think
that's very responsible

188
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,333
when you're a mother.

189
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,375
All I can really say
is that Mom trusts me.

190
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,666
And she thinks that
as long as I'm around,

191
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,083
she doesn't have
to worry about how

192
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,750
you'll manage while she's gone.

193
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,375
I don't think that's
very responsible

194
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,291
when you're a father!

195
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,208
I have two parents who are
both pursuing their dreams.

196
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,541
I think that's pretty awesome.

197
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,666
[OOYAMA]
Hmm...

198
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,708
[OOYAMA] So, it's selling
well? That's good.

199
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,916
[HARUKA] Seems like she
gets a ton from royalties.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,250
Wait, how do you know that?!

201
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,166
I better not find out you
took any money from her!

202
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,583
[HARUKA]
Don't worry.

203
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,416
She tried to leave money
with me, but I turned it down.

204
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,791
I know you would have
hated if I took it.

205
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:41,125
[OOYAMA]
Hmph. That's right. Good call.

206
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,375
[OOYAMA] So how much
money we talkin' here?

207
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,458

Huh?

208

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,500
Why are you being so loud?

213

something caught in my throat.

215
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,916
I'll go gargle some water.

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,208
[SOUICHIROU] Or maybe
you could just get Haruka

217
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,208
to throw some soda in your face.

218
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:53,333
You're not going to let
this go anytime soon, are you?

[PUNCH breathes heavily]

222

Hey, what are you
still doing up so late?

223
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,666
Punch is still so
quiet. Too quiet.

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,166
[PUNCH breathes heavily]

225
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,041
He doesn't feel like barking.

226
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,125
The vet told you not
to worry, didn't he?

227
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,500
So don't worry.

228
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,958
I can't trust that vet--
he's the worst!

229
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,166
He didn't even examine Punch!

230
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,708
[TOUMA]
He's a professional.

231
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,958
At the very least, if Punch was
dying, he would have known.

232
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:27,958

Don't say that!

Hmm?

00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,166
You know, when my Dad died.

238
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,833
I doubt I understood
what was happening.

239
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,250
Not enough to cry
about it at least.

240
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,666
Apparently, he was
a very kind man.

241
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,958
And Dad, he showered me with
a lot of love and affection.

242
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,000
At least that's
what Mom tells me.

243
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,041
But it's sad, to have
a dad like that pass away,

244
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,875
and not even be
able to cry about it.

245
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,750
I didn't cry, either,
till I got a face full of soda.

[PUNCH whines]

247
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,666
[TOUMA] I guess seeing him this
quiet does worry me a little.

248
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,666
He's usually so loud.

249
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,708
[OTOMI] I know, right?
But that stupid vet was like,

250
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,916
"He just ate too much,
he'll be okay!"

251
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,250
Wait, what?

252
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,750
He said Punch will bark again

253
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,041
once he gets hungry enough,
but it's not like I've been

254
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,750
giving him more
than I usually do!

255
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,833
So you fed him? When?

256
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,708
[OTOMI]
Early evening.

257
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,000
I fed him, too. When I got home.

00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,416
[OTOMI]
Huh?

259
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,791
His bowl was
empty so I filled it.

260
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,333
[SOUICHIROU] It was empty
when I gave him food, too.

261
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,416
[TOUMA, OTOMI]
Hmm?

262
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,333

00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,541
"when he gets hungry enough."

267
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:08,875
Guess so.

269
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,000
Would anyone mind
if I smacked him?

270
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,000
Just a little?

Yeah, there it is!

[SOUICHIROU]
What are you so excited about?

You're falling back
into old habits!

I am?

281
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:57,666
You're opening your body

and releasing
the ball too early.

I want you to try pitching.

Okay?

295
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,375
[OOYAMA]
After that summer,

296
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,708
he began to adore Meisei's
number one uniform.

297
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,208
[OOYAMA] His seniors had left
the team the previous autumn,

298
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:09,750
so Eisuke Tachibana became the
number two starting pitcher.

299
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,583
Not only that,
but the starting pitcher,

300
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:15,166
Obokata, lost his form and was
having trouble getting it back.

301
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,916
[OOYAMA]
Since it was his senior year

302
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,625
and last summer tournament,
it was the perfect chance

303
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:24,500
for Eisuke to earn
the number one spot.

304
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,666
That's what you'd think.

305
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,458
[NISHIO]
Well, Tachibana?

306
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,166
You can tell he's
much better, right?

307
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,791
Much better
compared to who, sir?

bother you too much, kid.

what number you are!

that you've made up your mind?

[NISHIO]
Hmm...

00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,208
How does 11 sound?

315
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,916
Or 12, if you prefer.

316
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,375
[OOYAMA]
Give it up, Tachibana.

317
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,625
[OOYAMA]
He's much better.

318
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,625
[TADASHI]
Hmm?

319
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,875
[TADASHI gasps]

320
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,208
I see Souichirou's throwing with

321
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,708
the same form
and grace as always.

322
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,083
Wait, he pitches, too? Really?

323
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,166
Uh, yeah. Did you
really not know that?

324
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,666
On their team
in elementary school,

325
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,208
he and Touma competed
with each other

326
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,791
over who'd become
the ace pitcher.

327
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,250
He could compete
for the position right now.

328
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,541
If he decided he wanted to.

329
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,750
Yeah.

330
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,875
[OOYAMA]
Hmm...

331
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,250
Why did you give up
on becoming a pitcher?

332
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,416
Rock-paper-scissors.

333
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,208
'Scuse me?

334
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,958
When we started Junior High,

335
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,083
Touma and I decided who'd pitch
with rock-paper-scissors.

336
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,541
You did?

337
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,125
Based on our track
record, I was pretty confident.

338
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,333
I was a shoe in.

339
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,250
But of course, I lost that day.

340
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:17,875
First time, I think.
He had always lost to me before.

341
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,333
You need that.

342
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,541
What?

343
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:24,208
That type of extra crazy
strong luck he has.

344
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,333
And you're okay
deciding by pure luck?

345
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,416
[SOUICHIROU] To be honest,
I've always had a disadvantage.

346
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,458
[OOYAMA]
Whaddya mean?

347
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,791
When Touma pitches,

348
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,375
he's got Souichirou Tachibana
catching for him.

349
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,166
And that's just not
possible when I do it.

350
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,208
[OOYAMA]
Huh?

351
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,333
[laughs]

352
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,833
Know what, kid?

353
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,041
I'm startin' to think
I've got that luck, too!

354
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,166
With the two of you
on my team. Amiright?

355
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,416
Rock-paper-scissors.

356
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,000
Shoot.

357
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,791

[OTOMI]
Hey, Akai!

361
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,500
[RYOU]
Hmm?

362
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,583
Hi.

363
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,791
Hey, Otomi! You come
to watch me play?

364
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:23,833
What are you doing?

365
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,791
Don't take your
eyes off the game.

366
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,250
Okay.

367
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,291
He's doing well
out there. Isn't he?

368
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,875
Yeah. When it comes
to playing baseball

369
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,625
he's not just all talk.

370
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,708
You can tell he
loves to practice.

371
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,375
And he studies the
game with passion.

[ICHIBAN grunts]

373
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,291
[OTOMI]
Now that I think about it,

374
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,583
his form is getting
pretty similar.

375
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,333
Huh?

376
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,083
[OTOMI]
To Tou's form, I mean.

377
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,750
Well, everyone learns
from someone.

378
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,458
Tou's form originally
came from Sou.

379
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,083
[RYOU sighs]
Guess your brothers get along.

380
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,666
I'm glad to hear that.

381
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,708
Well, they don't
sugar-coat things,

382
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,750
so they end up
fighting pretty often.

383
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,916
What about you? Any siblings?

384
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,208
[RYOU]
Yeah. I have one older brother.

385
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,000
Hyah!

386
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,333
You're really good
at sports so I gotta ask.

387
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,583
Was playing baseball not an
option for you growing up?

388
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,833
Yeah, you could say that.

389
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,375
Anything but baseball.

plan on starin' at me, dude?

to soccer practice already!

Oh, that's Kenjyou High.

401
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,500
I'm pretty sure it used to
be called Sumi Tech, I think,

402
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,541
but they changed the
name a few years back.

403
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,000
The year Meisei
made it to the Koshien,

404
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,083
this was the team they
faced in the finals.

405
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,750
Different name now but
it's the same school. Huh.

406
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,000
Yeah, and now both teams
are equally uncompetitive.

407
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,083
It's pretty crazy how
much has changed.

All right "Kenjyou High School."
Let's both do our best.
