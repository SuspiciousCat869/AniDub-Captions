Even if he times
his swing to the fastball

or breaking ball, there's still
a lot of movement on the pitch.

So the batter may make contact,
but it still won't go very far.

At least we have an edge.

206

Although, when they
used to play catch,

210
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:26,069
it was more like
they were fighting,

[MORI] But that's
easier said than done!

317
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:28,139
[HYOURI] Yeah, you got
that right. And Mita's not

318
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,433
the kind of pitcher you
can get a sacrifice bunt

319
00:18:30,517 --> 00:18:32,727
against very easily.

320

[MORI growls]

321
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:36,856
[HYOURI] Anyway, even if they
get the ball on the ground,

322
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,193
the guys on first and third will
dash in and grab it, no doubt.

323
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:42,529
I don't know if you're
aware of this, but those two

324
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:46,616
are great at handling
the ball. Sorry, Meisei!

[ANNOUNCER 22A] Batting second,
second baseman, Murotani.

[OOYAMA] The infielders are
back to their normal positions.

327
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:55,625
Yeah, that's because
there are two outs.

328
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:56,668
Question.

329
00:18:56,751 --> 00:18:58,753
Who on our team
is best at bunting?

330
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,338
Be honest.

331
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:02,882
[IMAGAWA]
I'd say Murotani for sure.

332
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:04,175
[OOYAMA]
Agreed

333

[IMAGAWA]
Hmm?

334
00:19:07,887 --> 00:19:09,639
Huh?! Hmm!

335
00:19:09,723 --> 00:19:12,726
But... there are two outs.

336
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:14,227

Yeah, so what?

Murotani bunts it!

339
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:23,862
Third baseman, Kaga, wasn't
expecting that and reacts

340
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:26,364
a little too late getting
his hands on the ball.

341
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:28,616
But he makes up for it
with a lightning fast play

342
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,701
to first base.

343
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:31,911
That's the ball
handling I mentioned!

344
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:33,288
Top notch!

345
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:35,498
But, unfortunately,
he throws it off the mark,

346
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:39,294
pulling the first baseman's
foot off the bag!

we've got on the team?

352

Guess that would be me.

But, Dad, in both
of his at bats so far...

359

...he's gotten struck out
swinging for the fences.

That is the whole point.

but it just barely drifted

the ball to that spot.

You're right.

what is with this heat wave?

You're right.

412

Wait! Just like that,

413
00:23:57,927 --> 00:23:59,512

on first and third?
