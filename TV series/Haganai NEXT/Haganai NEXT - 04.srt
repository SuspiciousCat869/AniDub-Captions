1
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,250
[HAYATO]
Is it true?

2
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,166
Are you going to
marry Zaki's girl?

3
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,375
Are you serious?

4
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:24,791
[HAYATO]
Yeah.

5
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,875
I just got off the phone
with him, and he went on and on

6
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,875
and on about setting a wedding
date for the two of you.

7
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,625
Although, I guess he did
sound a little sloshed.

8
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,708
I'm assuming you and Sena
are at least dating.

9
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,666
No, absolutely not!

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,500
[HAYATO]
Aw, well, that's a bummer.

11
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,791
But you do have
a girlfriend, right?

12
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,333
No girlfriend.

13
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,625
For that matter, I don't
even have a friend-friend.

14
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,333
[HAYATO]
Huh? What'd you say?

15
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,083
[KODAKA] By the way,
Kobato has a boyfriend.

16
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,791
She's staying at
his place again tonight.

17
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,166
[HAYATO]
Kobato what?

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,416
Who the hell is he?

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,291
Who's the bastard that
made a move on my angel?

20
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,875
I'm coming back home right now
and making that criminal pay!

21
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,666
[KODAKA] Relax; I was
kidding. Bye, Dad.

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,250
[HAYATO] Wait, are you
saying she isn't---

23
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,000
Yo guys, what's up?

24
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:39,708
Hey!

25
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,291
Kobato's here; awesome!

26
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,208
Go away.

27
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,500
You're so funny.

28
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,041
By any chance,
do you wanna go with me

29
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,625
to the amusement park tomorrow?

30
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,333
No!

31
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,750
Are you sure about that?

32
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,958
Check it out; I've got a pass
to Yokoshima Wonderland.

33
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,208
Somebody from work gave
my Daddy some tickets.

34
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,583
Oh, and there's this!

35
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,375
There'll be limited
edition stuff there,

36
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,125
and I'll buy you snacks
and a yummy hamburger, too!

37
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,416
Limited edition?

38
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,458
Hamburgers?

39
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:04,791
That does sound like fun.

40
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,375
There's no reason to be scared.

41
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,250
I'll be really gentle with you
and I promise we'll have fun.

42
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,250
So whaddya say, little sister?

43
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,375
Good grief, Meat.

44
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,833
How pathetic can you get?

45
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:16,750
What do you think you're doing?

46
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,541
Give that back, you stupid jerk!

47
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,666
Have you been to that
park before, Yozora?

48
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,416
Yeah, I went on a field
trip there when I was

49
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,541
in the eighth grade.

50
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,916
I'm pretty sure
I spent the entire time

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,833
reading a book, though.

52
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,583
Yeah, that sounds about right.

53
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,750
I've actually been there before,
but it was with my family.

54
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,041
And ever since then I've
wanted go to an amusement park

55
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,666
with some of my friends.

56
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:38,333
Yeah.

57
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,041
I kinda have, too.

58
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,625
Kay!

59
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,166
Tomorrow we are all gonna go to
Yokoshima Wonderland together!

60
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,708
[GROUP]
We are?

61
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,375
School's out and we've got time
to kill anyway, so why not?

62
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,916
[KODAKA]
Good point.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,333
[RIKA] It's a weekday, so it
probably won't be too crowded.

64
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,791
Rika is all about it!

65
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:54,833
Big Brother.

66
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,625
I shall accompany you as well.

67
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:57,500
Yay!

68
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,666
I'm going to the amusement park!

69
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,750
I suppose I could entertain
myself with a human pastime,

70
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:03,708
just this once.

71
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:04,375
All right.

72
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,416
It's decided, then.

73
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,833
[SENA]
Not so fast.

74
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,416
I only invited Kobato, not
the entire freakin' club!

75
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,791
What, this ticket admits
six adults, doesn't it?

76
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,500
We're helping you make sure
it doesn't go to waste.

77
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,333
Hold on.

78
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,833
It's for adults not kids?

79
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:18,458
Hooray!

80
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,625
Hooray!

81
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,500
Wait.

82
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,166
Does this mean I can't go now?

83
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,000
Cause I'm a little girl?

84
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,875
You're too young for the ticket.

85
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,833
[MARIA] I guess I
forget sometimes that

86
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,750
I'm just a little girl.

87
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,541
Don't worry, I'm used to it.

88
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,166
You all go and
have a great time.

89
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,083
No, I guess I can shell out
enough to buy a kid's ticket.

90
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:41,958
You can still go.

91
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,791
Do you really mean it?

92
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:44,916
You're such a good person!

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,208
Thank you so much, Sena!

94
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,208
Thank you, thank you!

95
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,625
Hey, um, Sena?

96
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,041
What is it?

97
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,000
Was it just me, or did you
notice something kinda off

98
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,125
about your dad yesterday, too?

99
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,708
I dunno.

100
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,791
Although, now that you mention
it, he got all happy and started

101
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,208
drinking after giving me
those tickets to the park,

102
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,125
which I guess
was a little random.

103
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,083
You know why?

104
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,625
No clue.

105
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,750
All I could think about was
inviting Kobato to go with me,

106
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,583
so I wasn't really
paying attention.

107
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,958
Naturally.

108
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,541
[KODAKA] It was
probably just a bunch of

109
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,666
drunken rambling anyway.

110
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,125
[SENA]
Tomorrow is going to be awesome.

111
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,291
Isn't it, Kobato?

112
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,833
[KOBATO]
No!

113
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,541
[SENA]
You are so adorbs!

114
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:31,541
[squealing]
This place is amazing!

115
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,958
We finally made it to
the fabled amusement park.

116
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,541
[KODAKA] I wonder if this is
Sena's first time here, too.

117
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,541
So which ride do you guys
think we should go on first?

118
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,291
You guys?

119
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,208
[YOZORA]
This one.

120
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,541
[ALL]
The Black Dragon!

121
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,333
[KODAKA]
What?

122
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,750
Are you crazy?

123
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,125
You seriously want to go
straight to the Black Dragon?

124
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,708
I swore to myself I'd ride this!

125
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,958
For the record, I didn't stay up
all night deciding whether or

126
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,000
not to ride it like some people.

127
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,541
I just figured I should since
it's famous and everything.

128
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,500
Prepare yourself,
Dragon of the Night!

129
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,875
The Black Dragon.

130
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,791
That title seems fitting
for those who are real men.

131
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:08,416
Come on, let's go!

132
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,041
Let's go ride it!

133
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:09,666
Let's go ride it!

134
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,875
Let's go ride it!

135
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,083
Fine, but don't come
crying to me later.

136
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,416
So far this isn't all that bad.

137
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,750
From up here,

138
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,958
all the common folk on
the ground look like ants.

139
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,125
What's the problem, dark dragon?

140
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,958
Is this really
all you have for me?

141
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,375
How sad.

142
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,541
[RIKA] Rika's getting
stimulated by these vibrations.

143
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,916
And they're definitely making
her all hot and bothered,

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,250
as they say.

145
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,041
Crap.

146
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,583
I don't think I like
how high we are.

147
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:49,458
Oh yes.

148
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,250
Bring it on.

149
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,833
Take me, Black Dragon!

150
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:56,625
Take me to the far reaches of
time and space and, um-- Uh.

151
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,750
I want to get off now, please!

152
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,916
[YOZORA] There is something
so wrong with whoever

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,875
thought up this lame ride.

154
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,916
I bet it was a freak pervert...

155
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,333
You lied to me again,
you poopy Yozora!

156
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,666
If I die, it's your fault!

157
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,041
[SENA]
Okay, seriously, stop the ride.

158
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,083
I want to get off.

159
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:17,625
Yes.

160
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:18,958
Here it comes.

161
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,958
We're all gonna die!

162
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,250
We're all gonna die!

163
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,958

00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,125
Oh!

327
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,541
You bought all that for her?

328
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,208
Why?

329
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,041
You didn't have to.

330
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,833
Nonsense, it was no trouble.

331
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,041
I enjoyed looking
after your sister.

332
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,416
It was an honor.

333
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,916
Here you go, honey.

334
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,458
Yay!

335
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,416
I love curry!

336
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,125
It looks like poo--

337
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,083
Your life depends on you
not finishing that sentence.

338
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,833
Curry tastes really yummy.

339
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:51,583
Good.

340
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,875
Ow, that hurt.

341
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,666
What do you guys wanna do
after we finish eating?

342
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,000
I want to go back and ride
the Black Dragon again!

343
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,083
I think we've all had enough
of the Black Dragon today.

344
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:06,916
Right?

345
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,500
Wrong.

346
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,250
I mean, I'm totally down to hit
up that roller coaster again;

347
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,458
it was a blast.

348
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,041
But if you guys are
just too scared to go,

349
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,291
I completely understand.

350
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,750
Don't go playing
all tough, Meat.

351
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,333
You thought for sure
you were gonna die.

352
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,833
Oh?

353
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,250
Says the girl who was screaming
for help the entire time?

354
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:21,791
Shut up.

355
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:22,916
I was so not.

356
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,666
[SENA]
Help!

357
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,708
Yeah, that's right;
your pathetic screams are

358
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,333
perfectly preserved
in my memory.

359
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,208
At least I wasn't
the one who was crying.

360
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,458
And, I happen to know you
peed in your pants a little!

361
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,666
How did you know that?

362
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,958
 Are you kidding?

363
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,500
You really did?

364
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,000
Of course not.

365
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,583
Don't be stupid; that lame
coaster didn't scare me at all

366
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,291
unlike you and your
panicked cries for help!

367
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,166
Fine, then why don't you prove
it to us by going another round.

368
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,333
Cool, let's do it.

369
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,541
But I'm not going
unless you go with me!

370
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,375
My camera will prove
you can't ride that thing

371
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,291
without screaming
your nasty head off!

372
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,416
Hold on, since when
do you have a camera?

373
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,083
Hidden and ready since always.

374
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,541
[YOZORA]
Who are you hiding it from?

375
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,166
[SENA]
No one.

376
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,416
It doesn't matter.

377
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,416
[MARIA]
Let's go on this one next!

378
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,708
[KOBATO] Don't listen
to her, Big Brother!

379
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,541
We're so high right now.

380
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,958
[KOBATO]
Those humans look like ants.

381
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,083
That thing's no joke.

382
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,958
I've never been on a coaster
that intense before.

383
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:42,041
Speaking of, I wonder how
Yozora and Sena are doing.

384
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,541
It's been a really long time
since we split up.

385
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,750
Do you think we should go
find out where they are?

386
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:52,916
[YUKIMURA]
Big brother.

387
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,583
The girls are over there.

388
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:05,750
[YOZORA]
My head hurts.

389
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,625
[SENA]
I feel sick.

390
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:08,416
Whoa.

391
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,625
What happened to you two?

392
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,875
Eight times.

393
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,208
Black Dragon.

394
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,291
[KODAKA] You rode the
Black Dragon eight times?

395
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:17,291
Yozora wouldn't admit that
she lost to me, big time.

396
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,541
Meat wouldn't hurry up
and just die, big time.

397
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,666
Interesting.

398
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,041
Which one of you was
the final winner?

399
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,000
Unfortunately,
this battle's not over.

400
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,083
It's time to get
the ninth round started.

401
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,125
Are you about ready?

402
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,375
Come on, guys.

403
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,458
You don't have
to do this anymore.

404
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,041
Nothing wrong
with calling it a tie.

405
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,166
Not happening.

406
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,916
Over my dead body.

407
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,708
She'll never beat me.

408
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,750
I won't allow--

409
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,916
[KODAKA screaming, gagging]

410
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,250
It's settled?

411
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,583
Meet in the
waiting room at four?

412
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:02,666
Maria.

413
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,333
Why are you coming
to the mens side?

414
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,416
Because I don't want
to go with the girls because

415
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,291
they smell like vomit
and that's gross.

416
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,333
Fair enough.

417
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,708
I guess I can't
fault you for that.

418
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,875
[MARIA]
Yay!

419
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,916
I'm gonna take a bath
with Big Brother!

420
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,041
[YUKIMURA]
Big Brother?

421
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,708
I shall wash your back for you.

422
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,666
[KODAKA]
No thank you, I'm fine.

423
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,958
I can do it myself!

424
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,333
[YUKIMURA]
Of course, as you wish;

425
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,250
I can see that I am
completely useless to you.

426
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,291
In that case, I must--

427
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,416
[KODAKA]
Okay, fine, you can wash it.

428
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,208
Please wash my back, Yukimura.

429
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,083
[YUKIMURA]
As you wish.

430
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,833
I will not let you down.

431
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:46,000
[YUKIMURA breathing heavily]

432
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,916
[KODAKA] Come on,
get it together, Kodaka.

433
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,833
Don't forget this guy is a dude!

434
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,583
So this must be what
a weenie looks like.

435
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,208
Bad girl.

436
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,500
Gimmie that towel.

437
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,250
Yeah, okay.

438
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,041
But I don't understand why
you have that weird thing.

439
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,416
What do you mean by weird?

440
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,541
It's perfectly normal;
all guys have these.

441
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,958
[MARIA]
Oh.

442
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,791
Okay, well, how come Yukimura
doesn't have one, then?

443
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
[MARIA] Yukimura is a boy
without a weenie!

444
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,250
That makes him weird!

445
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,750
[YUKIMURA] It's only because
I haven't matured enough yet.

446
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,000
[MARIA] Does that mean you'll
grow one when you get older?

447
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,500
[YUKIMURA]
Yes.

448
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,625
I shall work hard to be a
full-fledged man like my mentor,

449
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:25,916
Big Brother.

450
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,875
[MARIA]
I hope you get to get one soon.

451
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,125
You're not making sense--

452
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,416
[KODAKA]
What the-- He doesn't have one.

453
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:43,916
[YUKIMURA]
Forgive me.

454
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,416
I'm just easily embarrassed.

455
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,708
[KODAKA]
I feel so much better.

456
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:54,375
Of course a guy this cute
isn't actually a guy.

457
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,666
Where do you wanna go now?

458
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,916
Over there!

459
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,375
[RIKA] Well, Rika did not
see that one coming.

460
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,333
Excuse Rika for a minute.

461
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:09,625
Hold on.

462
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:10,750
Rika!

463
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,375
It is true.

464
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,750
There's no doubt
about it, Kodaka.

465
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,708
Yukimura's been
a girl this whole time!

466
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,791
That's exactly
what I just told you.

467
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,333
Oh.

468
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,250
Rika's used to checking things
out personally, for science.

469
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,791
Good, I'm glad you're convinced.

470
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,000
Can you make
Yukimura believe it, too?

471
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,083
I didn't have
much luck with that.

472
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,666
Weird stuff is all
you ever want Rika for.

473
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:42,750
Fine.

474
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,125
Yukimura, dude,
come with me, please.

475
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,541
You don't have a yaoi hole.

476
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,958
[YUKIMURA]
Really?

477
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,750
[RIKA]
Nope. Sorry, girl.

478
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,208
[YUKIMURA]
People have said that before,

479
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,583
but I thought I would get
one and be a boy eventually.

480
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,083
Kodaka.

481
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,708
I have bad news.

482
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,166
I'm afraid I am not
a true, powerful man.

483
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,208
That's probably because you're
not even a man to begin with.

484
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,333
No! Wait! Don't cry!

485
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,041
Please, stop that!

486
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,916
[YUKIMURA]
I deeply apologize.

487
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,250
Hey.

488
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,750
Can you at least tell me

489
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,250
what made you think you were
really a boy all this time?

490
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,333
Just family circumstances.

491
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,875
Uh-huh.

492
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,583
Wait.

493
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,083
That's the end of
the explanation?

494
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,333
It is.

495
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,166
I'm shocked that no one
figured this out before.

496
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,875
Actually, a few people have
noticed and pointed it out

497
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:45,416
to her previously, but she
decided not to listen to them.

498
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:45,916
[KODAKA]
Right.

499
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,291
Of course.

500
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,583
[KODAKA] I'm glad Rika
managed to bring her around.

501
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,458
[YUKIMURA]
Kodaka.

502
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,625
Do I still get to be
your little brother?

503
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,916
I'm not a boy, but I can't
just stop looking up to you.

504
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,833
You're still my little bro.

505
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:06,083
It's gonna take a lot more than
you being a girl to change that.

506
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,000
Good.

507
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,166
That's such a relief.

508
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,416
Thank you so much.

509
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,083
I'll always remain
your devoted servant.

510
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,500
Jeez, Kodaka,
why are you blushing?

511
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,875
How crazy is this?

512
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:20,041
Yukimura's suddenly looking
totally adorable to me.

513
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,625
I mean, talk about moe!

514
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:22,291
Moe?

515
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,125
Yeah.

516
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,375
The pretty little maid type.

517
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,416
Damn it.

518
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,541
How could I be
so completely blind?

519
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,458
All this time I thought
he was just strange.

520
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,333
Hey, guys.

521
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,666
What's the matter with Yozora?

522
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,083
She's so pretty and sweet
and super submissive.

523
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,291
Perfectly willing
to be his personal slave.

524
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,750
Gimmie a break!

525
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,750
I can't take it.

526
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,875
I have the worst luck.

527
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:49,166
Why does everything
always have to suck so hard?

528
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,958
[KODAKA]
They all look so cute.

529
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,041
When they're sleeping

530
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,375
they almost remind me
of normal girls.

531
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,708
Big Brother.

532
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,791
I'm still so shocked.

533
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,791
I never imagined
I was actually a girl.

534
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,875
It's not that uncommon
for a pretty-boy character

535
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,458
to turn out to be a girl, but
this is the first time Rika's

536
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,666
seen it in third person.

537
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,833
Yeah, well.

538
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:10,458
Change isn't always
that awesome, okay?

539
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,583
My apologies, sir.

540
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:13,625
Next time.

541
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:15,708
"That Kind of Play
is Not Allowed"

542
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:19,000
and "My Worldview is
Disturbed When You Are Around!"

543
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,000
Hey, Rika wonders what
"you" they're talking about.

544
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:21,791
It's you, Rika.

545
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:23,041
That was a spoiler alert!
