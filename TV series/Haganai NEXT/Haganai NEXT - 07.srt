[KODAKA] You've been obsessed
with your hair lately

but you don't care
about your clothes.

92
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,916
It's kind of a
strange combination.

wearing the same clothes

Aren't you just
full of surprises!

98
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,375
But to be honest, Rika has never
thought that worrying about

99
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,458
her clothes would
make a difference.

100
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,208
There's no incentive,
considering you don't even

101

105
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,833

all of that out loud again?

learn from the master!

You're such a

Actually.

00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,333
I honestly don't go shopping
that often, and when I do

119
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,541
it's at the fancy name-brand
places near my house,

so I don't know
what to tell you.

121
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,333
The only places close to your
house are a few mountains

122

and rice fields.

123

Is that true, Sena?

124

No, Miss Sena is fibbing.

You're right,
I'm sorry I lied to you.

126
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,791
Stella's the one who
picks out all of my clothes.

127
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,500
She styles my hair
and puts on my makeup, too.

128
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,625
What was that for?

129
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,166
It's not like
you know any better!

130
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,083
Femininity level of only five?

131
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,083

Hey, neat, a scouter!

133
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,083

do you buy your clothes, Yozora?

134
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,666
I get all my stuff online.

135
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,791
If I see a model with a
decent-looking outfit in

136
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,541
a fashion magazine
or on a website,

137
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:45,916
I'll buy the whole thing.

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,541

that you can look good

00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,958
It's very feminine, and
such an adorable sort of sexy!

145
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,083
[YOZORA]
Feminine?

146
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,375

Take it back!

150
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,000
This was in the "How to
Look Boyish" section,

151
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,916
there's no way
this can be sexy!

Yozora, listen to me.

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,416
When women rock
the "boyish" look,

155
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,416
it doesn't mean they're
dressing like a man would,

156
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,750
in fact it's usually
the other way around.

157
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,333
It's a way to draw out
your feminine charms

158
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,000
by being more androgynous.

159

Think shorts instead of skirts
and knits instead of wovens.

160
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,666
Seriously, you'd have to be
blind not to notice this stuff!

161
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,416
How often do you see dudes
strutting around in hot pants

162
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,791
and showing off
their belly buttons?

163
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,041
[YOZORA] But you're the
only guy whose wardrobe

164
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,125
I ever even noticed.

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,583
Oh, just forget it!

166
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,541
[YOZORA] I'm gonna do some other
shopping after I get her gift.

167
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,041
Kodaka, you can't come along!

168
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,041
[KODAKA]
That's cool.

169
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,583
Are you gonna be
okay by yourself?

170
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,333
[RIKA]
Rika will keep her company.

171
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,625
Yeah, all right.

172
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,250
Yukimura, do you mind tagging
along with Yozora and Rika

173
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,583
and keeping them in line?

174
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,000
We wouldn't want them to
freak out in the middle of

175
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,750
a public place,
do you know what I mean?

176
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,541
Yes sir.

177
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,916
I've got it under control.

178
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,958
I'll see you later.

179
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,916
Best of luck
shopping for Kobato!

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,583
Thanks!

181
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,916
Yeah, you too!

182
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,541
Well then.

183
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,791
That's that.

184
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,875
Why don't the two of us
start looking around?

185
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,208
[SENA]
Hey Kodaka.

186
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,458
What's something I could

187
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,625
buy for Kobato that'd
make her like me more?

188
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,208
I know she's into
Fullmetal Necromancer.

189
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,250
[KODAKA] Yeah, but she's pretty
much got all the merchandise

190
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,041
she could want already.

191
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,916
Oh, and please, don't
get her any expensive stuff.

192
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,541
[SENA] You're a more considerate
big brother than I thought.

193
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,083
What would you recommend, then?

194
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,083
[KODAKA]
I'm almost out of ideas.

195
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,500
How 'bout something you'd like?

196
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,250
[SENA]
Duh!

197
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,541
I totally want Kobato!

198
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,208
[KODAKA]
You can't have her!

199
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:01,708
Hey.

200
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,083
Over here.

201
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,958
I just thought of a gift
I know for sure she'd like.

202
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:05,916
[SENA]
What's that?

203
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,125
[KODAKA]
Meat.

204
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:10,000
I mean meat the food,
not meat as in you!

205
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,875
I knew that, don't rub it in.

206
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,250
[KODAKA]
Steak, bacon, wings, anything.

207
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,500
Get her some jerky
and she's yours for life.

208
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,041
Maybe so, but a meat snack's

209
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,458
kind of a messed-up birthday
present, don't cha think?

210
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,375
[KODAKA]
Good point.

211
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,041
Jerky?

212
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,500
What am I thinking?

213
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,375
Meh, remember that as a last
resort for the time being.

214
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,041
I'm sure we'll
find other good stuff.

215
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:29,625
[KODAKA]
Oh my gosh!

216
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:30,625
They have it!

217
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:31,791
They have what?

218
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,166
[KODAKA]
It's so beautiful.

219
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,583
[SENA] Seriously, since when
is the girl supposed to keep

220
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,500
the guy company when
they go shopping?

221
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,166
Normally it's
the other way around!

222
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,666
[KODAKA]
Sorry.

223
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,375
[SENA] And what the heck's so
special about frying pans,

224
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,416
anyway?

225
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,625
[KODAKA]
You've got to be kidding me!

226
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,083
D-fol pans aren't just
any 'ol frying pans!

227
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,000
Here, lemme try and
break it down for you.

228
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,500
[SENA]
Not necessary!

229
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,541
You are the
weirdest person I know.

230
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,041
It's almost kind of really sad.

231
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,208
[KODAKA] There's
nothing wrong with

232
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,666
liking high-quality cookware.

233
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,916
You've got a lot more issues
than just that one, dummy.

234
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,208
[KODAKA]
Shut up.

235
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,916
What do you think is
taking the girls so long?

236
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,916
[SENA] Girls always take a
long time to finish shopping.

237
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,833
At least they do
in dating games.

238
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,916
[KODAKA] You learned that
from a video game?

239
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,291
Hey Kodaka?

240
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,333
What do you think of the other
girls in the Neighbors Club?

241
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,125
Like, do you like them?

242
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,000
[KODAKA]
What do you mean?

243
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,500
[SENA] Man, why are you
so-- Ugh, never mind.

244
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,375
Do you ever even think about
dating and having a girlfriend?

245
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,500
[KODAKA] I guess I wouldn't say
I don't not want to date.

246
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,375
[SENA] Thanks for
clearing that up.

247
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,250
[KODAKA] Well, for
right now my main goal is

248
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,583
to make some friends.

249
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,791
Think about it, a boring
guy without any friends

250
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,750
isn't going to
impress many ladies.

251
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,583
Girls'll think
of him as a loser.

252
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,458
I don't think
that's necessarily true.

253
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:56,958
Man, how are you
so--Ugh, never mind.

254
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,166
[KODAKA] Hey, why do
you keep saying that?

255
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,166
Ah, random question.

256
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,291
Um, well-- What do you think
about the fact that Yozora

257
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,416
and I used to be friends?

258
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,166
You know, when we were kids.

259
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,541
[SENA] I was honestly surprised
when you first told us,

260
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,166
but then I thought things over.

261
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,583
I don't think
it's that big a deal.

262
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,291
In fact, it doesn't
matter at all.

263
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,375
[KODAKA]
You mean you don't care?

264
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,458
Well I mean,
it's in the past, right?

265
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,250
The present is
what's really important.

266
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,708
Yeah, I guess you're right.

267
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,500
Still, I haven't quite figured
out what Yozora's intentions

268
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,708
are with you.

269
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,500
[KODAKA]
With what?

270
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,125
Never mind.

271
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,333
I doubt I'm gonna
lose to her, anyway.

272
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,875
That's all.

273
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,583
[SENA]
Hey, before I forget.

274
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:45,208
And this is important, so please
make sure you remember it.

275
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,666
Don't think of
yourself as boring.

276
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,041
Anybody I like
can't be that lame!

277
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,708
[RIKA] Do you have any opinions
on Rika's new outfit?

278
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,750
This is what the clerk
recommended Rika try on for you!

279
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,250
[KODAKA]
Oh?

280
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,208
Well, it's-- I'd say that
whenever you try to look good,

281
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,708
you pull it off nicely.

282
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:07,791
Rika will interpret

283
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,875
that messed-up comment
as a compliment.

284
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,500
[YUKIMURA]
Um, Kodaka?

285
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,958
Do you think I look okay?

286
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,666
Yozora bought something else,
so she let me have this.

287
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,583
[KODAKA]
Damn Yukimura, that's hot!

288
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,958
Uh, I mean-- it
looks nice on you.

289
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,666
I'm very glad you like it.

290
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,708
Thank you.

291
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,291
Last but not least.

292
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,791
What the hell is that?

293
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,250
[SENA]
What are you wearing?

294
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,333
I'm so confused.

295
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,208
Woman, you're a disaster
in black cotton.

296
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,833
Oh, be quiet, flapjacks.

297
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm not in the greatest
of moods right now.

298
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,208
[KODAKA]
A tracksuit?

299
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,666
I found it marked down
at a sports store.

300
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,208
Don't you like it?

301
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,333
[YOZORA] Anyway, all these
crowds are making me

302
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,666
kinda groggy.

303
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,083
I'll just grab something
for Kobato near my place.

304
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,500
See ya later.

305
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,083
[RIKA]
Rika's gonna head home, too.

306
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,041
Thanks for the fun.

307
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:53,916
[KODAKA]
Sorry Sena.

308
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
My bags are getting heavy

309
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,833
and I'm tired of
lugging them around.

310
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,000
[SENA]
Not you, too!

311
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,458
[YUKIMURA]
I shall accompany you, Kodaka.

312
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,458
[SENA]
You have got to be kidding me.

313
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,166
You guys are so the
worst shoppers ever!

314
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,208

There!

00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,041
It's perfect!

316
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,666
But no surprise there.

317
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,000
Then again, do you think
Kobato will even enjoy having

318
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,041
a birthday party
that looks this lame?

319
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,125
[KODAKA] Cut us some slack, no
one here actually knows what

320
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,041
a normal birthday
party looks like.

321
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,583
This'll have to work for now.

[YUKIMURA] Along those same
lines, what are people supposed

324
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,708
Do you know, Kodaka?

most of the time.

327
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,333
Though that doesn't
sound like a lot of fun.

328
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,750
[RIKA]
Maybe everyone plays games.

329
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,166
It's a party, after all.

330
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,791
[YOZORA]
Fat chance that's gonna happen.

331
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,166
The only games we have are
your wonky computer games

Oh please.

There's no way she's not coming.

the bugs figured out!

00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,916
Yeah, too bad there aren't any
board games in here, though.

337
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,250

closest toy store and get one.

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,666
Sukiyaki?

475
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,833
That's that tasty-sounding
meaty dish that the dumb hag's

476
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,958
too stupid to make!

477
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,458
Hold on Big Brother,
lemmie help you set the table!

478
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,750
Go on, Kobato.

479
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,625
Tell Maria thank you
for the birthday present.

480
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,750
Oh.

481
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:16,750
Thank um--Thank--
Thank you, ah, poop.

482
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,041
Did you just
say something to me?

483
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,208
[KOBATO]
Never mind, dumb-butt!

484
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,208
[MARIA]
What was that for, pooper?

485
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,166
[KOBATO]
Jerkface!

486
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:22,958
[MARIA]
Devil dummy toilethead!

487
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:23,833
Gimmie back that present!

488
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,791
Kneel and repent your poopiness!

489
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,458
[KATE]
Thanks for the awesome meal!

490
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,125
[KODAKA]
I barely got any beef!

491
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,708
There were at least
four pounds worth, too!

492
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,166
[KATE] Those girls have
quite the appetite!

493
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,541
[KODAKA]
Hey, so do you.

494
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,333
[KATE] All that food
is making me tired.

495
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,333
Hey Kodaka.

496
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,083
Do you mind if
we stay the night?

497
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,500
It's okay by me.

498
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,333
Seriously?

499
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,375
Thanks bro!

500
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,791
There is no way
you're only fifteen.

501
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,833
Fine, I turned
sixteen a while back.

502
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,083
Here, check this out.

503
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,375
Maria gave it
to me on my birthday.

504
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,958
Hey, that's a nice locket.

505
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,500
What's with the bug?

506
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,750
Maria gave me the cicada shell,
and I got a buddy to make it

507
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,625
into a totally wicked necklace.

508
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,125
It's the only thing that
girl has ever given me.

509
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,708
Your life has been
kind of rough, huh?

510
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,791
Hey, I'm a big sister;
it is what it is.

511
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,000
Maria!

512
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,500
Big Brother's letting us
stay for the night.

513
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,291
[KATE]
Come on, get up.

514
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,333
You need a bath.

515
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,958
[MARIA]
I want one with Big Brother.

516
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,458
[KATE]
Hurry it up, girl!

517
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,041
I decided to be nice and wash
you, so you better behave!

518
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,916
I'll check and see if we have
any pajamas that'll fit you.

519
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,250
[MARIA]
Let me go, poopy old hag!

520
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,041
[KATE]
Shut up and hold still!

521
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,458
I'm glad Kobato isn't
that hard to deal with.

522
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,458
[KODAKA]
Kobato?

523
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,791
[KATE]
You gonna take a picture?

524
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:58,500
No!

525
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,041
I'm sorry!

526
00:20:59,125 --> 00:20:59,916
I'm so sorry!

527
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,791
[KATE] No wonder you
wanted us to stay the night.

528
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,375
I'm sorry about that, Kate.

529
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,666
[KATE]
Fine, I forgive you.

530
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,166
Well, that was quick.

531
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,500
Well, I'm pretty sure you
didn't stumble in on purpose.

532
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,250
[KODAKA]
Of course I didn't, geez!

533
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,625
Exactly, so it's not worth
getting all pissed off at you.

534
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,958
It's cool that you're

535
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,083
not making up excuses or
trying to defend yourself.

536
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,666
[KODAKA]
Yeah, when I do something bad,

537
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,666
I think it's best
to own up to it.

538
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,666
You really are
a halfway decent guy.

539
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,875
It totally makes sense

540
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,833
why Pegasus likes you
as much as he does.

541
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,125
[KODAKA] Oh, do you and the
president know each other?

542
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,833
Sure, me and Pegasus are
actually fishing buddies.

543
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,375
We go out ayu fishing
once or twice a month.

544
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,875
[KODAKA]
That's super random.

545
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,166
[KATE]
It's fun.

546
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,666
You oughta come along sometime!

547
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,583
Yeah?

548
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,083
Maybe someday.

549
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,458
[KATE] Hey, thanks for
letting us crash.

550
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,416
Till next time!

551
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,125
[KODAKA]
Yeah.

552
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,583
See you guys at school.

553
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,041
[KATE] Man, sometimes
I wish that you really were

554
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,416
our bigger brother.

555
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,375
Then again.

556
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,791
To be honest.

557
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,291
I wouldn't mind if you
were more than just a brother,

558
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,416
because that way you could
walk in on me all the time.

559
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,541
But you do have Sena,
so-- Well that's out.

560
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,041
Alrighty, see ya!

561
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,458
[KODAKA]
It wasn't long before

562
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,125
I figured out what Kate
was getting at.

563
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,375
It wasn't very long at all.

564
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:58,875
Ah, that was delicious!

565
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,125
Let's go home and take a nap.

566
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,333
Hey!

567
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,458
Do the preview like
a normal person, hag!

568
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,250
Yeah, whatever,
you annoying brat.

569
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,875
Next: "My Childhood Friend Is
Too Much of a Battleground."

570
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,833
If Big Brother has
childhood friends,

571
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,375
that means he's all grown up!

572
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,125
I wanna have a
childhood friend, too!

573
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,583
Don't be dense, you're
still in your childhood.

574
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:15,833
Though in another five years,

575
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,416
I bet Kobato could be
your childhood friend!

576
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,375
I don't want no poopy vampire
to be my childhood friend!

577
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:23,166
You and her will be
my enemies forever!

578
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,416
Take that, poopy hag!

579
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,458
Fine, fine!
