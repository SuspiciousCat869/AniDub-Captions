1
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,416
[SENA]
I have a question for you.

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,958
[KODAKA]
Yeah. What is it?

3
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,416
Why were you talking
to Yozora in that dream?

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,625
I mean, if you
went back ten years.

5
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,000
Why was what?

6
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,250
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,500
She's talking about how
you were sleep talking.

8
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,083
You kept shouting,
"Yozora, Yozora, Yozora!"

9
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,583
Don't you think
that's kinda weird?

10
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,000
[KODAKA]
Are you serious?

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Agh, you guys, there's
nothing at all strange about me

12
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,750
showing up in a dream that
took place when he was younger.

13
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,583
We played together when
we were little kids.

14
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,000
You played together?

15
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,375
Like you and Kodaka did?

16
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:52,541
Did I stutter?

17
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:53,875
It was a long time ago.

18
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,041
Kodaka moved away from here
for about ten years,

19
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,208
but before that, we both
went to the same school.

20
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,625
We hung out and played
and all that stuff.

21
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,375
So I guess you could
say we were friends.

22
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:04,708
Friends?

23
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:05,791
You were?

24
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,791
Well, why have you
never said anything?

25
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,375
Look, we were friends
when we were kids;

26
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:11,875
it's not like it's personal.

27
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:14,750
Honestly, I didn't think anybody
would even care about it.

28
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,708
I don't get why
it's such a big deal.

29
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,416
Rika had a feeling
something fishy was up.

30
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,500
You were friends.

31
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,666
Rika didn't expect that, though.

32
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,708
Yeah.

33
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,458
I didn't either.

34
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,375
[IN-GAME GIRL]
Any other suggestions?

35
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,416
[KODAKA]
Guess it's back to normal.

36
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,541
[IN-GAME GIRL]
Okay, then our contribution

37
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,416
to the school festival
is officially...

38
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,291
Thanks.

39
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,500
Hey, that reminds me.

40
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,208
Don't we have
a school festival coming up?

41
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,166
Kodaka.

42
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,291
I believe you just
stepped on a land mine.

43
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,291
Explain that.

44
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:41,791
No.

45
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,125
Never mind.

46
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,083
In fact, I don't even know
what those words mean.

47
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,375
Whatever, the school festival
is all a lie anyway.

48
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,875
Come on.

49
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,708
You're being ridiculous, and
this time no one's sure why.

50
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,250
[YOZORA]
Think about it.

51
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,500
We're talking about a school
festival here; also known as

52
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:58,291
an event for people with real
lives also known as not us.

53
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,458
Kay, I see your point.

54
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,875
Uh huh, I thought you might.

55
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,166
Yeah.

56
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,791
I suppose an event
like that has nothing to do

57
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,125
with losers like us, huh?

58
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,541
[SENA]
Shut your mouth!

59
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't lump everyone
into Loserville with you.

60
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,208
Just so you know, I'm
a big deal at this school.

61
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,291
And I was all over
last year's festival;

62
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,791
they couldn't get enough of me.

63
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,041
True!

64
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,000
Rika remembers seeing
a lot of Sena last year.

65
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,041
She watched the festivities
from the guest seating,

66
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,000
on the President's
personal invitation.

67
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,291
See, so you can tell them
how amazing I was!

68
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,500
Now go ahead, Rika, and don't
leave anything out, either!

69
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,083
Oh.

70
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,375
Okay, well I saw you in a bunch
of the athletic competitions.

71
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,458
That's right.

72
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,000
Like running the
two hundred meter dash.

73
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,666
As well as the
scavenger hunt race,

74
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,583
and of course
the obstacle course.

75
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,458
I did the bread-eating race.

76
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,041
And I rocked the marathon.

77
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,291
Oh, and my favorite was
the mock cavalry battle!

78
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,958
It was awesome, as was myself.

79
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:46,666
[KODAKA]
Wow.

80
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,958
That's impressive, Sena.

81
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,583
Thanks; I did the
Culture stuff, too.

82
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,750
I'm more than an athlete.

83
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,166
Right, Rika saw you
in the class play.

84
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,291
Sena bravely cut down all
the bad guys with her sword.

85
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,541
Yeah, no surprise there.

86
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,041
I was the star of the show.

87
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,291
No matter what it was, you
were the one way more into it

88
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,208
than anybody else,
which was awkward.

89
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,750
Everybody there
was super annoyed.

90
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,916
Don't be hateful.

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,083
That's not true.

92
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,708
All of the audiences
went crazy over me.

93
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,458
[RIKA]
Well, of course they went crazy.

94
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,291
With your running and jumping,
your boobies jiggled like crazy

95
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,708
all over the place,
so the guys loved it.

96
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,000
They saw your panties
during the play, too.

97
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,541
You're telling me they
weren't mesmerized by my

98
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,291
brilliant performance, they were
excited about a panty shot?

99
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,541
That's so awesome.

100
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,416
Sounds like a tragically
hilarious case of Meat

101
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,416
acting Meat-like to me.

102
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,291
Wow.

103
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,458
You were so close yet oh so far.

104
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,125
[SENA]
I was not.

105
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,291
You shut your face!

106
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,166
See.

107
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,250
This proves the school festival

108
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,208
is no place for
people with no lives.

109
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,708
So we should sit it out
and let them have their fun.

110
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,541
So, Kodaka, I was
wondering, who do you think

111
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,833
you're gonna spend the
day of the festival with?

112
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,291
I know; the Neighbors Club can
present our own special event

113
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,250
in the Culture portion
of the school festival!

114
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,041
No, we can't.

115
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,250
Whaddaya mean we can't?

116
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,791
It's perfect for us.

117
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,041
This kind of cheesy stuff is
pretty much our club's thing.

118
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,083
She's right, if anything's
our formula, it's this.

119
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,166
And, if you think about it,
this will be great practice

120
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,166
for when we go to
festivals with friends.

121
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,541
It can be new research.

122
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,416
Good idea!

123
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,291
No, no it's not!

124
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,666
Rika has no objections to it.

125
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,875
You guys, hold on!

126
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,083
[YUKIMURA] Big Brother's
wish is my command.

127
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,916
Kodaka.

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,708
What's wrong now, Yozora?

129
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,458
Nothing, fine!

130
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,250
You're just really stupid.

131
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,208
Very well.

132
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,791
The Neighbors Club
will participate

133
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,375
in this year's school festival.

134
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,166
We shall take hold of those real
lifers in the middle of their

135
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,250
festivities and we'll cast them
into hell where they belong!

136
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,208
Yay hell!

137
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,458
Understood completely.

138
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,083
Yep.

139
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,416
I'm in; let's go!

140
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,666
I dunno.

141
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,208
Casting them into hell
seems a little extreme.

142
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,833
All right, first we have

143
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,125
to decide what we want
to contribute as a group.

144
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,250
[SENA]
How about a maid café?

145
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:43,958
Go die.

146
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:44,750
What's wrong with that?

147
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:45,916
Everyone knows a maid café

148
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,208
is the easiest path
to festival victory.

149
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,750
Don't be such an idiot, Meat.

150
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,583
Isn't it obvious I'm
not the kind of girl who

151
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,083
can wait on customers?

152
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,375
Yeah, I can't imagine Yozora
ever being able to manage that.

153
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,583
Especially not
dressed up as a maid.

154
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,750
I just pictured Yozora
wearing a maid outfit

155
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,625
waiting on customers, and
it was the funniest thing

156
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:05,791
I've ever imagined.

157
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,125
Oh, my sides!

158
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,416
Sure.

159
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,166
It's true that I'm not
very good at customer service.

160
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,416
So what.

161
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,958
I mean, it's not like
any of you are either!

162
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,458
Hey.

163
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,250
Gimmie a break; I think I can
at least handle that much.

164
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,583
Though I have no experience.

165
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:20,291
Yeah, right.

166
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,625
If Kodaka tried

167
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,875
customer service all the
customers would run away.

168
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,375
Don't be rude; they would not!

169
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,291
I can act nice
whenever I want to!

170
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,583
But the problem
is you never want to.

171
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:31,833
Okay, Miss Know-It-All,

172
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,083
then what about you--can
you do customer service?

173
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,833
You should know by now not
to underestimate the power

174
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,458
of genius inventor Rika Shiguma!

175
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,750
Hey, Yozora?

176
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,375
Do you have the maid
costume Yukimura wore when

177
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,791
we thought he was a boy?

178
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,083
Yeah, I think so.

179
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,458
Hold on.

180
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,541
Rika might as well try
the outfit on so she can

181
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,166
practice it right.

182
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,416
Close your eyes.

183
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,250
Rika's going to change
clothes, so no peeking!

184
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,583
Got it.

185
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,041
[RIKA]
You may open your eyes now.

186
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,541
Your face is telling Rika

187
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,916
you've simply acknowledged
Rika is wearing maid clothes.

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,041
However, you don't have
any comments in particular

189
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:18,916
on the matter.

190
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,333
You're right about that.

191
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,041
That was pretty cool;
you just totally read my mind.

192
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,041
You're an imbecile!

193
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,791
Why are you so stupid, Kodaka?

194
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,333
And you kept your eyes closed
the whole time I was changing!

195
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,250
You moron--you were
supposed to sneak a peek!

196
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,250
What for?

197
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,666
[RIKA]
What for?

198
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,708
Forget about it.

199
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,166
Listen up, jackwagon.

200
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,083
Get your boneheaded ass
out of this room,

201
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,541
and come back in again!

202
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,000
You know, you've had
a really foul mouth lately.

203
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,000
You twisted twat-face
with pudding for brains!

204
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:49,833
Ow, jeez, Rika!

205
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,291
What the hell was that for?

206
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,708
Shut up and sit down in your
chair, you fucking clown!

207
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,083
Bitch, I said sit down!

208
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,583
 Ow...

209
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,125
You understand you're being
kicked, but for some reason

210
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,500
you can't grasp the idea
of sitting your ass down?

211
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,791
What kind of poorly
trained fleabag are you?

212
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,958
Rika seriously questions
whether there are brains in

213
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,125
that thick skull of
yours, which, by the way,

214
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,666
is the color of her poop
after she eats curry!

215
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:13,791
Stop!

216
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,000
You can't do whatever
you want just because

217
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,000
you've randomly decided
to be a dominatrix!

218
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:17,541
Ha!

219
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,750
Rika says ha.

220
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,208
Good grief.

221
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,750
Rika doesn't remember giving
a brainless dog permission

222
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,666
to sit in the chair
of a human being!

223
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,833
Fine.

224
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:26,916
Then just tell me
where you want me to sit.

225
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,541
There's a chair
right in front of you.

226
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,958
Unfortunately,
it's invisible to fools.

227
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,458
Rika is going to set this
here, but it is not for you.

228
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,541
And, just so you know, the
coffee costs nine hundred

229
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,375
and eighty yen,
is that understood?

230
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,333
I can't believe you're
gonna charge me for coffee

231
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,750
I didn't even order.

232
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,291
And it's expensive.

233
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,375
[RIKA] Whatever, just take off
your pants and pathetically

234
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,958
humiliate yourself in public
by exposing your privates

235
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,666
as you enjoy the diabolical
combination of coffee aroma

236
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,791
and the stench of
your own crotch.

237
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,000
You perverted worm.

238
00:09:59,083 --> 00:09:59,875
[KODAKA]
Please.

239
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,333
I'm begging you.

240
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,041
I can't take any more.

241
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,375
Oh.

242
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,083
Promise that you'll
come back to see Rika again!

243
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,833
[KODAKA]
Not on your life!

244
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,208
Come on, admit it.

245
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,000
You love seeing Rika like this!

246
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,666
How can I admit to
liking something that

247
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,000
was so brutal to me?

248
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,375
Well, that's unexpected.

249
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,833
Rika was sure this attitude
would be quite popular.

250
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,958
Illogical thought process aside,

251
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,916
this could be a good
direction for us to take.

252
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,625
Nope.

253
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,875
I beg to differ on that.

254
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,583
What did you think, Yukimura?

255
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,083
[YUKIMURA] I'm afraid
your skills are still

256
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,500
somewhat immature.

257
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,875
Oh.

258
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,958
Well, you're a former maid,
right, so, do you think

259
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,000
you could teach us the essence
of what a real maid should be?

260
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,125
[YUKIMURA]
Yes.

261
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,875
The essence of a maid.

262
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,250
Simple.

263
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,083
It is complete and utter
devotion to Big Brother.

264
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,583
Okay, you're up next.

265
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,625
Care to give us a little taste

266
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,416
of your customer
service skill set?

267
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,125
Uh.

268
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,125
You wanna see me?

269
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,958
[RIKA]
Rika knows she does!

270
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:54,958
Come on, Sena.

271
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,666
Rika bets you're
really good at it.

272
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,541
[SENA]
Guess I don't have a choice.

273
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,166
All righty, Kodaka.

274
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,250
I'm gonna change now,
so go wait in the hallway.

275
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,375
I can't just close my eyes
like I did before?

276
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,916
[SENA]
No, of course not!

277
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,875
I mean, we already have two
full strikes on our record, so.

278
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,458
Our what?

279
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,166
[SENA]
Never mind!

280
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,458
Just get out of here!

281
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,500
What's her problem?

282
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,333
[SENA]
You can come in now, Kodaka!

283
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,125
Welcome home, Master.

284
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,625
How has your day been?

285
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,083
[KODAKA]
Uh.

286
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,625
Is that too small?

287
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,916
Stop staring at me
like that, gah.

288
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,416
How did you two fit into this;
it's like crazy tight;

289
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,041
I can barely even breathe.

290
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:39,791
Holy shit.

291
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,375
You can say that again.

292
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,166
Okay, holy shit.

293
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,333
[SENA]
What would you like?

294
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,333
We have special maid sandwiches.

295
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,041
Special maid tea and coffee.

296
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,708
Special maid yummy cake.

297
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,791
We have what ever
your little heart desires,

298
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,125
so what'll it be, Master?

299
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,083
Coffee I guess.

300
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,083
That sounds great.

301
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,541
[SENA]
Coffee it is.

302
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,500
Coming right up, Master!

303
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,791
I'm really confused right now.

304
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,916
How come you're
so good at doing this?

305
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,166
It's not all that confusing.

306
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:10,791
Uh.

307
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,541
I'm just uh-- Oh!

308
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,458
I'm just copying
Stella, that's all!

309
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,583
Is that what it is?

310
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,250
You have a
professional butler at home,

311
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,625
so that's almost the same thing?

312
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,333
Totally.

313
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,666
Almost exactly.

314
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,291
So you have a
professional butler.

315
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,541
I fail to see how watching

316
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,791
a butler would make you
the perfect café maid.

317
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,708
Well, whatever it is,
you're really good.

318
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,708
Stop flattering me, silly.

319
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,916
Wait, I forgot.

320
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,916
I have to do a spell
to make it taste better!

321
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,250
What kind of spell?

322
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,458
Taste better,
taste better, now.

323
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:37,875
Oh!

324
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:38,750
Kay!

325
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:39,791
Yummy!

326
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:41,583
Um.

327
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,583
That kind.

328
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:44,500
Really?

329
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,125
Uh.

330
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,416
Yes, Miss Master.

331
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,875
Really, really, really.

332
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:49,875
Really?

333
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:50,625
Yep.

334
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:51,458
Haha.

335
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,666
Really.

336
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,250
Really, Meat?

337
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:58,958
No, I don't visit maid cafes

338
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,833
as much as I can when I'm not
in school, leave me alone!

339
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:06,666
All right.

340
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,583
Maid cafes are off the table.

341
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,125
See ya; I'm heading home now.

342
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,416
Cool.

343
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,125
Oh, right.

344
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,750
Hey, Yozora, I forgot I had
something to ask you.

345
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:30,375
[YOZORA]
No, wait.

346
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,916
It's not.

347
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I uh.

348
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,166
This isn't what
it looks like, Kodaka.

349
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,416
I swear to you!

350
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,000
Uh.

351
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:36,875
I have reasons.

352
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:37,541
I mean.

353
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,083
Wait.

354
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,125
No!

355
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,625
Leos!

356
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:49,500
[FEMALE TV HOST] This week,
be sure and keep your eyes out

357
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,208
for a disturbance in the force.

358
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,416
Because, if you don't have
the right attitude about it,

359
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,666
you might end up
hurting your friends.

360
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,958
All my Virgos will need...

361
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,125
Like I have any friends anyway.

362
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,625
What are you doing today?

363
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,291
Do you have any more
make up classes?

364
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,708
I do not, today marks the end
of my two week long ordeal.

365
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,625
I am free to live as I please.

366
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,333
Must be a relief, huh?

367
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,208
Maybe next time try not
to fail your classes.

368
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,666
[KODAKA]
Hm, let's see.

369
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,791
I like the idea of
a fortune telling booth.

370
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,000
Please tell me you don't
really believe in that stuff.

371
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:24,666
[KODAKA]
Well.

372
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,083
Not personally, no.

373
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,208
But I guess I thought a lot
of people liked having

374
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,375
their fortunes told.

375
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,958
'Specially high school girls.

376
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,250
Not me; I don't
buy any of that BS.

377
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,750
I mean, when
you're chosen by God,

378
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,791
every day is your lucky day.

379
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't need some wrinkled,

380
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,791
old hag to tell me
how wonderful my life is.

381
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,916
[YOZORA]
You're exactly right, Meat.

382
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,666
You are blessed and
every day is your lucky day.

383
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,791
[SENA]
Yozora.

384
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:49,750
So you admit the truth?

385
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,000
I do.

386
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,833
You've been lucky every
single day of your life.

387
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,708
Meaning you've
hit your luck ceiling.

388
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,458
There's nowhere else to go.

389
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,041
You will never
make a new friend.

390
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,166
The girls at school will
forever hate and shun you,

391
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,791
so they'll keep ganging
up on you, which means

392
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,291
you'll always be
alone in gym class.

393
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,375
When people pair up
for home ec or a field trip,

394
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,958
someone will inevitably say,
"Hey, Sena, why don't you

395
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,041
pair up with a boy?" And
then everyone will laugh.

396
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,666
Your memories will be ruined.

397
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,166
And right now is the happiest
your life will ever be.

398
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:17,875
[SENA]
Rude much?

399
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,125
How can you say that?

400
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,500
For what it's worth.

401
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,833
Rika thinks you should just
try to be happy anyway.

402
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,291
I feel so sad, now.

403
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,500
Poor, poor Sena.

404
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,750
You don't really
believe her, do you?

405
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,375
[YOZORA]
Still though.

406
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,833
I think I can get behind
the fortune telling idea.

407
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,083
[KODAKA] Are you a believer
in that kind of thing, Yozora?

408
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,083
No, I absolutely am not.

409
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,083
For three months in middle
school, I checked every fortune

410
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,666
I could get my hands on.

411
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,791
TV, newspapers, magazines,
I checked them all.

412
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,291
I also recorded in detail
everything that happened to me

413
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,375
on those days.

414
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,583
Afterwards.

415
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,125
I objectively assessed
my so-called "luck",

416
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,791
tallied it against
all the fortunes,

417
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,458
and collected the statistics.

418
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,125
Not a single fortune had
an accuracy rate higher

419
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,791
than seven percent.

420
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,208
Therefore!

421
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,916
I decided I could not
believe in fortune telling.

422
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,500
By taking it to that extreme

423
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,541
you seem more than
a little fortune obsessed.

424
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,375
For real.

425
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,791
More importantly,

426
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,416
why are you agreeing to do
the booth after all that?

427
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,458
[YOZORA] All we have to do is
make up a bunch of random crap.

428
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,083
Then we'll be able to screw
over all the real-life-havers

429
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,541
who are unintelligent enough to
take fortune telling seriously.

430
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,208
I can't imagine anything
more fun than that.

431
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,375
[KODAKA]
How cruel.

432
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,000
[SENA] You're an actual
witch, aren't you?

433
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,458
[YUKIMURA] If you ask me,
I think you sound crazy.

434
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,625
[YOZORA]
Meat.

435
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,750
I'll read your fortune
as an experiment.

436
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,333
Why would you wanna do that?

437
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,666
Yes.

438
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,000
I see it.

439
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:44,583
[SENA]
Uh.

440
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,083
See what?

441
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,458
[YOZORA] Something is troubling
thee right now, is it not?

442
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,500
[SENA]
Troubling me?

443
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,416
For real?

444
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,833
Thee?

445
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,833
[YOZORA] Tis something to
do with thy relationships.

446
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:55,708
Well.

447
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,541
Now that you mention it, yeah.

448
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,625
I guess that's accurate.

449
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,958
[YOZORA]
I know.

450
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,541
Thou art giving off
a faint purple mist,

451
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,333
a mist that
symbolizeth uneasiness.

452
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:08,000
I can tell from the shape
of the mist that relationships

453
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,000
are the root of this trouble
in your life right now.

454
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:11,666
Wow.

455
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,500
You're right.

456
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,750
A hundred percent.

457
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,250
Yes, because I see-eth
and knoweth all things.

458
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,166
I can also tell, thou
generally thinkest in a manner

459
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,291
which brings about
a positive attitude.

460
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,750
However, occasionally
thou feelest regret.

461
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,791
How could you know all that?

462
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,250
And here we go.

463
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,791
Thou hast certain gifts.

464
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,250
Gifts that are far and above
what those you find around you

465
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,791
have been given.

466
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,958
Yet I can sense thou are often
frustrated at not being able

467
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,583
to express these gifts
to their fullest.

468
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:41,500
Though thou hast an optimistic
side, at times thou waverest

469
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:45,666
about thy actions and
decisions, growing worrisome.

470
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,166
And whilst thou art
normally cheerful.

471
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,916
Thou art also prone
to great loneliness.

472
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,875
Impossible!

473
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,583
Tell me how you know that!

474
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,375
[KODAKA]
Hey.

475
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,833
This type of reaction
has a name, doesn't it?

476
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,541
Yeah; that's right;
it's called the Barnum effect.

477
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,833
It's a psychological
phenomenon wherein the subject,

478
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,375
when told general things
that could apply to anyone,

479
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,375
takes them to be an accurate
personal diagnosis.

480
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,791
You know, I honestly didn't
expect you to understand me

481
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,041
so well, Yozora.

482
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,125
How funny.

483
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,916
It's making me
feel happier in a way.

484
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,083
And, she fell for it hook,
line, and sinker.

485
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,666
Shocking.

486
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,916
I am willing to tell thee a way
to immediately improve the life

487
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,416
of a sweet yet awkward
person such as thyself

488
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,041
if thou art willing to listen.

489
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:29,875
Really?

490
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,291
Tell me, I'm listening!

491
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,833
[YOZORA] Tonight at midnight
on the dot, thou must go

492
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:37,291
to the roof and balance a
bowl of water upon thy head,

493
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,583
turning around three times
whilst giving an eerie shriek

494
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,833
and shouting, "Sexy Beam!"

495
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,625
loud enough for the
whole house to hear.

496
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,583
If the water doth not spill
from the bowl, thou shalt attain

497
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,041
the moon's blessing,
and thy life will be visited

498
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,791
by great fortune.

499
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,041
Shut the hell up.

500
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,333
Oh, thank you, Yozora.

501
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,583
I've misjudged you,
and I'm so sorry.

502
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,875
It's not a problem.

503
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,000
Go forth now.

504
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,750
May thee... be happy.

505
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:10,791
[PHONE]
You've got mail.

506
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,708
[PHONE]
You've got mail.

507
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,041
Sena?

508
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,458
[SENA]
Daddy spanked me so hard,

509
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,625
but I don't mind if
it's for my happiness!

510
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,500
Sexy beam!

511
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,541
Oh, crap; don't tell me
she actually did it.

512
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,500
Yozora!

513
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,708
What do you want, Meat?

514
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:39,875
Don't you--

515
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,166
Don't you "what do you want" me.

516
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,166
You skank.

517
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,625
How dare you
trick me like that?

518
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,708
Trick you?

519
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,791
Why whatever do you mean?

520
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,458
That fortune telling yesterday.

521
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,250
You made up
that stupid mean lie.

522
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,416
It was so mean.

523
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,708
And hateful.

524
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:56,875
And then--

525
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,083
Hey, don't let
your dad get you so upset.

526
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,750
His favorite pastime is yelling
at you about the stupid stuff

527
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,208
you always do;
it's kinda his thing.

528
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,583
That's not the issue!

529
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,166
Yesterday, I felt so happy.

530
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,041
I had hope again.

531
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:11,791
You-- I don't know,

532
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:16,541
you just really--You just--
you're so mean.

533
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,541
And dumb.

534
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,000
You're mean and dumb.

535
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,416
I feel like crap,
so I hope you're happy.

536
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,000
Come on.

537
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,583
Let's go ahead and go
to the clubroom, okay?

538
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,791
I have been awaiting
your arrival, my other half.

539
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:39,500
Oh, hi--

540
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,208
Yay!

541
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,500
You're here!

542
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,833
It feels like it's
been forever, right?

543
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,208
What up, girl?

544
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,208
Did you just come by
to hang out with me?

545
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,291
Too cute!

546
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,291
Oh, you are my angel!

547
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,000
It's true, your
angelicness is...

548
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,666
Kodaka, help!

549
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,458
[KOBATO]
Shut up.

550
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,666
I don't like this.

551
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,875
Why do you always talk
like a crazy person?

552
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,541
What the hell
are you looking at?

553
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,625
Oh, nothing, never mind.

554
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,666
How lucky am I that I get to
see you today, am I right?

555
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,750
[YOZORA]
It seems that good fortune

556
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,958
has visited you after all.

557
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,208
You're right.

558
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,000
I think I'm like totally
back on a roll again!

559
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,291
What on Earth could be luckier
than being visited by Kobato?

560
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,541
Look.

561
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,708
She's just here 'cause
she doesn't have to stay

562
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,416
after school to make up
classes any more.

563
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,125
Yes.

564
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,666
I suppose that is right.

565
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,125
This has nothing what so ever
to do with Yozora's mean old

566
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,625
fake magic.

567
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,875
So you say, but how will
you ever know for sure?

568
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,583
Y'know, that right there
is why nobody likes you.

569
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,333
Well.

570
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,250
It's whatever.

571
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,541
I'll forgive you this time.

572
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,625
There's no sense being mad
when Kobato's here.

573
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,041
Like I care what spoiled
meat thinks about me.

574
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,250
Glad you're
finally back with us.

575
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,833
[RIKA] So have we decided
whether or not we're doing

576
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,291
the fortune telling booth
for the festival, yet?

577
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,208
Rika brought reference books
with her just in case.

578
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:00,791
Cool.

579
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:01,875
I dunno, Rika.

580
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,958
I guess we can decide later.

581
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,458
Agreed.

582
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,583
Birthday Fortune-Telling?

583
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,291
Oh.

584
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,458
Hey, that reminds me,

585
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,875
guys, Kobato's got
a birthday next week.

586
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,875
Wait, seriously,
Kobato's birthday?

587
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,000
That's what I said.

588
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,708
It's October
eighteenth, every year.

589
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,500
We have to celebrate, obviously.

590
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,291
You heard me.

591
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,500
We're having a
birthday party for Kobato!

592
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,958
At last, I have returned
victorious from my long

593
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,458
and brutal battle to the death!

594
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,000
Yeah, congratulations.

595
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,166
Now, study every day so you
don't fall behind and have to

596
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,458
make the next test up.

597
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:11,291
I only failed that last exam
because the akashic records

598
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,000
randomly malfunctioned on me.

599
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,666
No more excuses, young lady.

600
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,833
Get to studying!

601
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,708
Yeah, okay.

602
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,333
Next time: He's My Brother,
But As Long As There's Love,

603
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,833
It Doesn't Matter If He
Gets More Sisters, Right?

604
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:23,500
Wait!

605
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:24,708
Yes it does matter!
