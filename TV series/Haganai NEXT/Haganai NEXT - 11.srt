00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:22,375
Look, guys!

2
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,833
It's Kobato!

3
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:24,791
Where's Rika?

4
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,291
[MARIA]
Rika is... not here?

5
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,291
Then that means the movie
isn't here, either.

6
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,250
[YOZORA]
Yup.

7
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,625
This is so stupid.

8
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,583
She messaged me late last night
saying it would be done today

9
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,458
no matter what, and we
had nothing to worry about.

10
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,125
So dramatic.

11
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,541
[KODAKA]
Hold on.

12
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,291
Does that mean she
pulled an all-nighter again?

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,458
I'm gonna go check on her.

14
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,333
[KODAKA]
Rika!

15
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,583
You in there?

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,250
What the-- Why is it unlocked?

17
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:08,708
Rika?

18
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,208
Rika!

19
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,166
[KODAKA] The doctor said
it was just a cold.

20
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,333
Okay, seriously.

21
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,000
She didn't have
to worry us like that.

22
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,708
[YOZORA]
I was thinking.

23
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,083
Is it possible we put too much
pressure on her by letting her

24
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,458
edit the whole thing by herself?

25
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,958
[KODAKA]
Maybe.

26
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,791
[YOZORA]
Whatever.

27
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,000
We don't have time to waste
worrying about that now.

28
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,250
How is that a waste of time?

29
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,791
[YOZORA]
We can't do anything about it!

30
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,166
We have work to do!

31
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,375
[KODAKA]
What are we gonna work on?

32
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,250
We have to cancel
all the screenings.

33
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,833
Cancel them?

34
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,916
Such a waste of good close-ups.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,791
[YOZORA]
It's not finished.

36
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,500
What else are we supposed to do?

37
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,583
Besides.

38
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,208
It's pointless to have
a premiere of the movie

39
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,375
when all seven
of us aren't there.

40
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,250
I agree.

41
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,500
[AOI]
No touching!

42
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,083
Mitts off the bulletin board!

43
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,333
It's sacred!

44
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,500
Oh, Kodaka.

45
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,875
I didn't recognize you.

46
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,250
Hey, it's okay, Aoi.

47
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,208
Didn't mean to
freak you out like that.

48
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,708
Something came up and my group
had to cancel the presentation

49
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,666
so I was taking
down the posters.

50
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,416
My bad.

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,666
Hey, guess what?

52
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,666
Remember that time
I accused you of touching

53
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,958
the bulletin board
and you didn't?

54
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,208
That was dumb.

55
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,333
You're not the kind of
guy who would do that!

56
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,125
I'm sorry, but this is so lame.

57
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,541
I'm not trying to pansy out but
you might be the first person

58
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,083
ever to believe that I'm not
trying to ruin their lives.

59
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,541
[AOI] I'm not trying
to understand anything

60
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,375
you're saying right now, but
it's obvious your heart is

61
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,750
as sweet as the nose on
your perfect little face.

62
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,083
No wonder you and
Sena are together.

63
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,708
You're like an angel-mouse
couple straight out of

64
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,625
a pastry cart!

65
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,416
I could eat you alive!

66
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,208
Put that in park.

67
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,500
Sena's not my girlfriend.

68
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,458
We're in a club together.

69

[AOI]
Not possible.

I know Sena Kashiwazaki and
home girl's not in any clubs!

She is, but it's
only been since June.

00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:49,958
[AOI]
Huh.

73
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,458
"The Neighbors Club"?

74
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,541
I've never heard of this

75
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,916
and I've got at
least four neighbors!

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,375
What do you guys do in there?

[KODAKA]
We-- uh.

00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,791
Right now we just
take these posters down.

Right, I'm sorry.

for you in here.

Of course there is.

joke's getting ol--

[KODAKA]
Wow.

Maybe you shouldn't get better.

91
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:30,916
Why do you want Rika

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,666
to keep suffering from
a terminal illness?

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,291
[KODAKA]
No!

94
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,750
I was just joking!

95
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,625
You guys aren't showing
the movie at all anymore?

96
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:39,708
Nope.

97
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,083
But Rika was so
close to finishing it.

98
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,083
There's no point in making
you do that if you just end up

back in here.

Fine, but it's
seriously almost done!

You guys could show what we have
and nobody would ever know!

We're not gonna do that.

[KODAKA] We can't have a
premiere of a movie we all

worked on if not all
of us are there.

That's what Yozora said.

[KODAKA]
Yeah.

but I agree with her.

your game face?

in case I ever take you up

Rika just had
the best idea ever!

on campus, much less
in the building!

324
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,500
Yeah, it does say outsiders
aren't allowed on property

325
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,625
even if accompanied
by a legal student.

326
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,125
[AOI]
Okay, then!

327
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:44,416
However, middle schoolers are
not considered outsiders!

328
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,625
They may go to school on a
different campus, but they're

329
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,958
still students of Saint
Chronica's Academy, right?

330
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,041
But more importantly,
since when is your own brother

331
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,208
or sister considered
an "outsider?"

332
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,708
And let's talk
about this chapel.

333
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,083
Yeah, it's on campus, it's
open to the public--anyone can

334
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,916
come in here at any time whether
they're thirteen or ninety!

335
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,541
Which means, someone who's a
student and sister of a member

336
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,375
in a public location
can't be an outsider!

337
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,000
[KODAKA]
What she said.

338
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,833
You're okay.

339
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:15,666
This isn't over!

340
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,916
I'm gonna think of something!

341
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,291
Come here, shoes.

342
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,833
Ugh.

343
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,833
Is there anything we can do to
make sure she doesn't come back?

344
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:34,125
Conversations with stupid people
make me want to throw up.

345
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,166
Presidential wisdom.

346
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,416
Good work.

347
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,083
Get ready to pack up
'cause I got you this time!

348
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:45,750
Gross.

349
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,333
Do you still exist?

350
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,666
I really am over your
pointless cockiness.

351
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,708
I happened to find a section
that says this Neighbors Club

352
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,541
crap is definitely in
violation of school rules.

353
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,333
My god, you're obsessed!

354
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,125
Section Two, Rules for
Extracurricular Activities.

355
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,291
Look.

356
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,625
Right here it says,
"as a rule, classes,

357
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,333
clubs and other activities
undertaken in groups,

358
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,125
must be conducted under the
supervision of an instructor!"

359
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,083
That just means we have
to have an advisor present

360
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,375
at all the meetings, doesn't it?

361
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,500
[AOI]
Yeah!

362
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,541
And you don't have
an advisor present!

363
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,666
It says here in
Article seventy-eight.

364
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,750
"Student Council bylaws say that
club advisors must be faculty

365
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,333
or staff of the school!"

366
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,291
Great because in Section Two it
says that a Sister's authority

367
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,083
is equal to that of any
faculty member on campus.

368
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,541
So yeah, we're all good there.

369
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,791
[AOI]
Um, how?

370
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,416
You don't have a Sister
you can call an advisor!

371
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,625
I hope you weren't
referring to Maria Takayama

372
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,958
during that speech, 'cuz
she's not an actual Sister!

373
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,541
That's right.

374
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,083
I checked the roster
of Sisters thoroughly.

375
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,958
There is absolutely
no Maria Takayama listed.

376
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,833
There is someone registered
with that last name

377
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,291
and it's her sister, Kate.

378
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,583
Which means Maria here is
just a random little girl

379
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,208
who hangs out in a chapel.

380
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,875
Illegally!

381
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,041
No freaking way!

382
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,750
We listed her as our club
advisor and it was approved!

383
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,625
Someone on staff made a mistake!

384
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,333
Hold on.

385
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,416
I'm gonna clear this up!

386
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,083
[KATE]
Hey Broseph!

387
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,166
What's up?

388
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,916
[KODAKA]
I need your help with something.

389
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,458
Maria's a Sister, right?

390
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,625
Like, she's legit?

391
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,458
[KATE]
No.

392
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,083
[KODAKA]
Huh?

393
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,416
What do you mean?

394
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,708
[KATE] She's my assistant,
but it's not official.

395
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,208
I'm just trying to help her
develop the skills

396
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,666
for when she gets older.

397
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,875
Plus, it's easier for me
to keep an eye on her

398
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,375
if she's at the same school.

399
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,708
[KODAKA] But why does she tell
everyone she's a teacher?

400
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,541
[KATE]
I don't know!

401
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,958
Great imagination, I guess?

402
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,541
[KODAKA] She wears the nun
outfit every freakin day!

403
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,250
[KATE]
'Cause it's adorable!

404
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:30,833
Apparently it's true.

405
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,500
She's not a real Sister.

406
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,333
Well, that sucks.

407
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,375
Man, talk about
a bubble being busted.

408
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,166
But if I'm not a real
Sister, then what am I?

409
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,833
[AOI]
That's right, turd-faces!

410
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,083
You don't have an advisor!

411
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,291
And if you don't
have an advisor,

412
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,083
you don't have
a legitimate club!

413
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,708
If you're trying to
form a club illegally,

414
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,416
then you're trying
to get disbanded!

415
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,000
And if that's not
what you're looking for--

416
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:55,208
[SENA] If Maria were an official
advisor we'd be all good, right?

417
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,500
Yeah, but she isn't one.

418
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,833
Her sister said she was fake.

419
00:17:58,916 --> 00:17:59,666
Uh-huh.

420
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,791
Shut up and wait here a sec.

421
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,208
Uh.

422
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,625
Want coffee?

423
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,958
Huh?

424
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,291
[KODAKA] Don't worry; I promise
no one's trying to poison you.

425
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,583
[YUKIMURA]
Oh no.

426
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,666
Forgive me, sir.

427
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,291
I'm afraid I've
missed the opportunity

428
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,750
to destroy our enemy.

429
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:20,916
[KODAKA]
Stop.

430
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,833
Hurting her isn't
gonna solve anything.

431
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,833
[SENA] Thank you very much for
your patience, Commoners.

432
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,375
Good news!

433
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,041
Maria's just been offered a
part-time specialty position!

434
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,083
Huh?

435
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,291
[MARIA]
That's nice.

436
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,708
But, what's a part time
specialty person do?

437
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,625
You teach classes part time.

438
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,875
So glad I have the
greatest Daddy in the world.

439
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:38,625
No way!

440
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,500
Serious?

441
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,708
I'm a real live teacher?

442
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,083
Not just pretend?

443
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:42,875
[SENA]
Yep.

444
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:43,750
Think you can handle it?

445
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:44,583
Totally!

446
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,000
Heck yeah!

447
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,125
[SENA]
Sweet.

448
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,583
We'll add that to
the paperwork, then.

449
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,708
Yay!

450
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:50,375
I'm a real teacher
in a real school...!

451
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,208
[SENA]
Hey Daddy.

452
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,625
Okay, she accepted.

453
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,041
Yeah.

454
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:53,833
Okay.

455
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:54,583
Okay.

456
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,333
Yeah.

457
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,458
'Kay, bye.

458
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,416
 This is ridiculous!

459
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,333
I won't allow it!

460
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,708
Really?

461
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:01,958
'Cause the president of the
school thinks it's fine.

462
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,500
'Cause you didn't
tell him the whole truth!

463
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,708
Just because you decided to get
an advisor now doesn't mean

464
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,291
the club wasn't
founded illegally!

465
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,541
It's still not legit!

466
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,041
Omigod, shut your flytrap!

467
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,791
Listen and listen well.

468
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,916
No matter how hard you
work to get us shut down,

469
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,250
I can still make a phone
call and have it reversed.

470
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,833
We have an advisor now, okay?

471
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:19,916
Your narking paid off.

472
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,083
You look like a hero.

473
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,166
You're freaking welcome.

474
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,625
I don't believe you.

475
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,875
You're lying about something.

476
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,500
[SENA] You don't know
when to quit, do you?

477
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,916
This club and
everything in it is mine.

478
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,875
I can do whatever I want;
so if you keep pulling

479
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:34,916
this student council crap,
you won't be a member anymore!

480
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,166
If you'd rather not deal,
I can have you expelled.

481
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:37,875
What?

482
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,458
But you can't expel me!

483
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,500
[SENA]
Wanna test it and find out?

484
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,541
You better hope you're right.

485
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:49,916
Um.

486
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,083
Sorry I ruined your meeting.

487
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,958
I hope you can forgive me.

488
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,333
And the club was saved by the
rich girl who abused her power

489
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,083
and threatened to
have someone expelled.

490
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,541
Well, I guess we know
who the villain is.

491
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,875
Oh whatever!

492
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,958
At least I got it done
and we still have a club!

493
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,833
You made me miss
Kaoru's bunny costume!

494
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,166
Did you do that for the club or
were you just trying to get back

495
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,708
to your stupid bikini game?

496
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,875
Be honest, Sena!

497
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,625
[SENA]
I was trying to finish the game!

498
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,333
At least we know her priorities
will always be the same.

499
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,875
Please.

500
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,125
If that's all it took to get
rid of her, then she's totally

501
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,875
not worth stopping the
game to try to impress.

502
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,083
If she was someone worthy of
respect, she would have ignored

503
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,041
me and kept fighting for what
she thought was actually right.

504
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,625
[KODAKA] I do sort of
feel bad for little Aoi.

505
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,291
But at least we know
if Sena's around,

506
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,750
the Neighbor's Club won't
be shut down any time soon.

507
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:38,541
[SENA]
Oh.

508
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,708
Kodaka, I have a question!

509
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,416
Actually, Daddy reminded me
of this when we were on

510
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,000
the phone a little while ago.

511
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:45,791
What?

512
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,916
[SENA]
Just curious.

513
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,875
Would you ever
reconsider marrying me?

514
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,750
It's been on my mind ever since
that whole betrothal thing.

515
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,375
I mean, I've told you before.

516
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,208
I don't care about some
stupid promise our fathers

517
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,208
made to each other ages ago.

518
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,333
That is still true, but
this time it's different.

519
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,416
Now I don't care that
the promise was made,

520
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,875
because even if it's what our
parents want, it's what I want,

521
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,125
too, and I wish I had never
called off the wedding.

522
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,000
I know this
seems kind of random,

523
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,041
but I totes love you and stuff.

524
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,041
It just kinda
makes sense, ya know?

525
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,875
I'm sorry it took me
awhile to realize it.

526
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,541
[KODAKA]
What the hell are you saying?

527
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,208
Hey!

528
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,875
You made me lose
the entire game!

529
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:25,875
I'm sorry.

530
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,958
So, what were you saying before?

531
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:28,625
Evs!

532
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,750
I know you heard me!

533
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,458
Whoa.

534
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,625
I, uh, said that
out loud, didn't I?

535
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:43,250
Well, I was planning to
tell you sooner or later anyway.

536
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:43,875
Wow.

537
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:44,666
Yeah.

538
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,083
So um-- Now you know.

539
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,333
Let me know when
you have an answer.

540
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:00,958
[KODAKA]
Um.

541
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,750
The uh-- that game
you were playing.

542
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,000
It's so loud, I couldn't
hear anything you said.

543
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,708
What was it again?

544
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,000
Are you serious?

545
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,250
Sorry!

546
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,333
There's an important
errand I forgot to run!

547
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,666
Found you, Demon Astaroth!

548
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,291
I have decided today I will
use the magic my teacher

549
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,625
taught me to destroy you!

550
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,625
I admire your spirit, Guernica,
and respect your right to

551
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:10,291
destroy me, but you should
know-- I am your father!

552
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:10,833
What?

553
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:11,625
You're a horse!

554
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,083
How is that even possible?

555
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,250
It's actually a long story.

556
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,000
I don't want to know.

557
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:15,708
Hang on!

558
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,125
One more, and I'm out!

559
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,791
Join us next time for the final
episode of Haganai Next:

560
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,041
I 'blank' Many Friends!

561
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,125
Shatter the very
soul of my enemy!

562
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:24,083
Nine Lives Breaker!
