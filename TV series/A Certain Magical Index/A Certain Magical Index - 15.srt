1
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,958
Toma!

2
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,041
Come on, Toma!

3
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,250
I am currently away
from Academy City...

4
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,333
Index and I are staying at

5
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,416
some out of the
way beach resort...

6
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,041
Obviously, this little
vacation was not my idea.

7
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,291
What do you mean

8
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,750
I have to get out of
the city immediately?!

9
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,166
Your recent adventures

10
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,000
have caused quite an uproar
among the higher-ups...

11
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,958
The things you've
been up to...

12
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:34,791
reflect poorly
on Academy City,

13
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:37,375
so they want you to
keep a low profile...

14
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,708
at least until the
worst of it blows over.

15
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,041
They've even arranged
a place for you

16
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,750
to stay for a while...

17
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,125
Let's see here...

18
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,208
Ah! There it is...

19
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,500
It looks like a pretty
nice place, don't you think?

20
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,916
I'm going!

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,666
I don't care what you say,
I'm coming with you...

22
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,958
You have to take me!

23
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,500
I've never even been
to the beach before!

24
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:57,166
I told you no... Got it...?

25
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,041
Think you can be reasonable
for once in your life?

26
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,625
You're an illegal
immigrant with no ID.

27
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,208
If I brought you along,

28
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,208
we'd just be stopped at the
gate by Antiskill and arrested.

29
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,208
No, means no,
that's final.

30
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:11,541
Go on through.

31
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:14,958
How is that possible?

32
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,416
You call yourself security?!

33
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,666
So, just like that,
I'm on the beach with Index,

34
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,125
and I don't really
understand why.

35
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,791
I have a bad
feeling about this.

36
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,833
I'm guessing they had a
reason for picking this place.

37
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,500
I don't think it was
a random decision.

38
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,041
Toma...

39
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,250
I found a cute hat when
I was out on the beach...

40
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,750
I brought it back here
as a present for you.

41
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,583
Uh... thanks.

42
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:39,750
Here, try it on.

43
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:48,125
[Music]

44
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,500
What bad luck, this happening
so soon after you arrived.

45
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,458
It's early in the
season for jellyfish,

46
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,791
but this year they've been
all over the place.

47
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,666
Business has really taken a
nosedive thanks to the outbreak.

48
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,416
I didn't mean to,
I swear...!

49
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,291
I didn't know what jelly
fish looked like.

50
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,375
This is the first
one I've ever seen.

51
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,833
All right, then.

52
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,875
I'll come back in a little
while for the first aid kit.

53
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,625
Oh, sure... Thanks.

54
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,208
Sorry to interrupt.

55
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,416
While you were out there
was a call from the party

56
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,166
that's joining you.

57
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,583
They said that there
has been a delay,

58
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,125
and they will arrive
tomorrow morning instead.

59
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,041
What...?!
That can't be right!

60
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,333
I was supposed to
meet them today!

61
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,708
-I was looking...
-We understand.

62
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,208
Thanks for giving
us the message.

63
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,833
It's not a problem.

64
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,083
If you'll excuse us.

65
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:04,875
Well, that's
disappointing!

66
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,541
Yeah... this is where I'm
supposed to meet them.

67
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,125
Their names are Toya
and Shina Kamijo.

68
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,958
In other words,
my parents.

69
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,125
Hey, Toma!

70
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,000
Are you ready...?
Let's go!

71
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,083
Miss Komoe must've
arranged this get together

72
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,333
because we don't see
each other often...

73
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,416
My little cousin is
supposedly with them, too.

74
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,250
Hey, tell me something.

75
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,625
What?

76
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:41,750
Tell me about
your parents.

77
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,541
What are they like?

78
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,833
Wh-What are they like...?

79
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,916
I bet you're a lot like
your dad, aren't you...?

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm excited to meet them.

81
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,458
I hope they like me.

82
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,708
Well...? Are you
listening over there?

83
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,250
Yeah, I'm listening...

84
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,416
You'll find out what
they're like tomorrow.

85
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,166
Hey... why are you always
so rude to me, Toma?

86
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,416
Would it kill you to tell
me something about them...?

87
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,541
You, Toma Kamijo, are
a cold, heartless, curt,

88
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,250
indifferent, impolite, mean,
inconsiderate young man.

89
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,500
I swear, half the time

90
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,583
I don't know why I bother
putting up with you!

91
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,125
Well... we'll both
find out tommorow.

92
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,250
I can't tell
Index about them.

93
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,500
Since I lost my memory,
I don't know.

94
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,416
I wonder what
they're like...

95
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,750
What kind of son am I...?

96
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,541
How am I ever gonna
pull this off?

97
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,750
And now, the man you've
all been waiting for...

98
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,375
Welcome Hitotsui Hajime!

99
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,958
Hi.

100
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,041
Hey, everybody.

101
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,375
Considering everything
that's going on,

102
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,583
I don't think it's
too surprising

103
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,208
that I'm anxious right now.

104
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,666
Is everybody gonna
finally find out

105
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,083
that I've lost my memory?

106
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,750
Oh well, worrying's not
gonna help anything...

107
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,750
I'll just deal with
tomorrow when it gets here.

108
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes?

109
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,250
Oh right.

110
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,250
Thanks!

111
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,666
Toma!

112
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,541
You're looking well, son...

113
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,541
Anything new with you?

114
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,166
Oh... no...

115
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,416
You look good, too.

116
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,000
I've got something
here for you,

117
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,875
if I can just find
where I put it...

118
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,500
I went to India on
business not too long ago.

119
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,708
I got this souvenir
while I was there.

120
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,833
The shop owner told me
it's one of their gods.

121
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,500
It's great, thank you.

122
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,916
Is something
bothering you?

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,791
The way you're talking,
you'd think you just met me.

124
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh, uh, no, I....

125
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,458
Here, let me get your bag.

126
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,666
You can get your
mother's and Otohime's...

127
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,166
They should be getting
here about now.

128
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,333
We can wait.

129
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,833
So this man is my father.

130
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,583
Sorry we were so late...

131
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,208
I know we said we'd
be here yesterday,

132
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,083
but we just finished
moving in...

133
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,500
You know how
hectic moving is.

134
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,791
We're still
getting adjusted.

135
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,958
You guys moved?

136
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,208
I told you...

137
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,708
last month when we
spoke on the phone.

138
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,375
Oh... right.

139
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,125
All right... I guess I
won't get to see the house

140
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,250
I grew up in...

141
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,375
Oh well, it's fine.

142
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,500
Toma!

143
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,583
Oh... they made it.

144
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,875
Toma!

145
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,500
So that's my
little cousin.

146
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,458
I'm so happy to see you!

147
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,083
I missed you so much!

148
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,791
I'm so glad we're
all here...!

149
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,125
Are you happy to see me...?

150
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,208
Huh?

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What d'you say, Toma...?

152
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,541
Will you take me to
the beach later?

153
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,500
So? Will you?

154
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,041
Well...? You
will, won't you?

155
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,083
Wait... Hold on a minute!

156
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,750
Huh...? Why?
What's wrong?

157
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,208
What the hell do
you think is wrong?

158
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,708
What are you
doing here...?

159
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:44,583
And what's with this gross
younger sister act you're doing?

160
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,666
What do you mean?

161
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,916
Dad, what are you doing

162
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,833
bringing her along on
vacation with you...?

163
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,583
And how do you even
know each other?

164
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,125
What're you talking
about Toma...?

165
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,000
I've known her as
long as you have.

166
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,083
She's your little cousin
Otohime, isn't she?

167
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:00,791
You idiot, cut it out...

168
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,208
Stop it... right now...!

169
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,625
Get off my back!

170
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,250
Look at you two.

171
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,916
Toma, there's no need
to be embarrassed.

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,416
Otohime just
wants to hug you

173
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,125
because she hasn't seen
you in so long, that's all.

174
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,208
Great timing...

175
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,625
What the hell are
you doing here?

176
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,125
My goodness...

177
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,083
What's happened to your
language, young ma...

178
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,208
When I left a minute ago,

179
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,125
you were sleeping
soundly in the room...

180
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,708
What did you do,
teleport here...?

181
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,958
I mean do you think you're
Kuroko Shirai or something...?

182
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,541
And why are you talking
like some old lady?

183
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,833
Scolding me for
my language,

184
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,000
and calling me young man?

185
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,708
That's enough.

186
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,250
What's gotten into you
today...? Apologize.

187
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,125
That's no way to
speak to your mother.

188
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,291
Well, are you
gonna answer me?

189
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,625
I asked what's
gotten into you.

190
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,916
Explain yourself.

191
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,541
Seriously, Dad...?

192
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,166
This girl right here...

193
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,291
She barely looks old enough to
see a PG-13 movie unsupervised,

194
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,500
and you're trying to tell
me that she's my mother?

195
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,791
Oh, how sweet...

196
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,458
If you keep telling
me how young I look,

197
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,708
I might forgive you for
the way you spoke earlier.

198
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,333
And what about this girl...?

199
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,208
You want me to believe
that this human bug zapper

200
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,416
is my little cousin?

201
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,125
What do you mean?
I'm not a bug zapper!

202
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,375
Yes, that's
what I'm saying.

203
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,583
She's your cousin and
this is your mother...

204
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,666
What on Earth has
come over you, Toma?

205
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,250
What on Earth hasn't
come over me?!

206
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,958
Am I being punked or
something...?! I give up.

207
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,541
Where'd you stash the
hidden camera...?

208
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,291
I don't appreciate being the
butt of your practical joke.

209
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,166
I'm not laughing!

210
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,666
What do you people have
against me, anyway?!

211
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,875
Now, now. Let's just
calm down a minute...

212
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,458
Here, take a look
at this pen...

213
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,375
It changes whenever you
turn it upside down...

214
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,125
-See, the woman's dress is...
-Later!

215
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,833
Hold on, Toma...!
Where are you going?

216
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,000
We're not done talking.

217
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,708
Yeah, wait for us!

218
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,208
Toma, dear!

219
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,916
Mess with me, will he...?

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,708
I can't believe that's
what my dad is like.

221
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,166
Welcome to our inn.

222
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,083
We have everything
prepared for you...

223
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,166
Come in and make
yourselves at home.

224
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,791
Thanks... we're
glad to be here.

225
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,458
Somethin' wrong, Toma?

226
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,625
So... you're in on it,
too, Misaka Sister...

227
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,416
How long have you
been planning this?!

228
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,750
Huh?

229
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,291
Oh, please...
pay him no mind...

230
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,083
It's been a while
since he's seen us.

231
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,541
His emotions are
running high.

232
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,041
It's a pleasure to
welcome you to our inn.

233
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,125
Please allow me to show
you all to your rooms.

234
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,666
Now, then. Shall we?

235
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,083
It's right this way.

236
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:36,083
Oh... It looks like your other
guest has woken up as well.

237
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,125
Ah... beautiful
morning, isn't it...?

238
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,958
Let's hurry and grab
some breakfast, okay?

239
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,666
Come and play!

240
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,416
Come on, hurry up!

241
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,833
And now I'm at the beach
with Mikoto Misaka,

242
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,041
who is wearing a swimsuit

243
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,958
and acting like she's
my little cousin...

244
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,708
Obviously, this little
outing was not my idea.

245
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,166
You're kidding me!

246
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,875
Stop it, Toma.
I can't breathe!

247
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,125
Let me go!
Damn you!

248
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,333
Take it easy, Toma!

249
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,958
This stupid joke is
ending right now!

250
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,875
Why don't we go to
the beach for a swim?

251
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,291
That should cool you
down a bit, ya' think?

252
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,333
We'll settle in and
join you later okay?

253
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,166
Damn my luck.

254
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,666
How much longer can they
keep this farce going...?

255
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,625
This is one elaborate
practical joke.

256
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,208
Are you feeling
calmer, Toma?

257
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,541
I don't understand what's
got you so troubled......

258
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,458
but here maybe
this'll help.

259
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,791
It's a souvenir I picked
up on a trip to Russia...

260
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,208
It's a doll...

261
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,291
and another... and another.

262
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,041
Well? It's pretty cool,
don't you think?

263
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,541
No, it's not even
a little bit cool.

264
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,166
What a shame.

265
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,250
It's really too bad that
you and your father

266
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,250
don't share more of the
same interests, Toma.

267
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,250
Whoa...! What are you...?
Why are you...?

268
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,458
Now that's what
I'm talkin' about!

269
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,166
It looks fantastic
on you...

270
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,083
It's definitely worth
every cent I paid for it.

271
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,416
You mean you're the one who
bought this abomination...?

272
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,291
Is this another
hobby of yours?

273
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,375
Well... You see, when you
travel all over the world

274
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,666
for business like I do,

275
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,333
you develop an eye for
more sophisticated sty...

276
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,083
What do you think
you're doing, Toma?

277
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,500
What do you
think I'm doing?

278
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,583
I've just learned my father's
a disgusting pervert...!

279
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,083
A dirty old man with a
damn Lolita complex!

280
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,500
Oh, hey, look over there...!

281
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,500
Your little friend
is joining us.

282
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,208
Toma!

283
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,333
Not nice!

284
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,666
C'mon, why are you
acting all weirded out?

285
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,708
Toma, dear!

286
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:03,958
Shut up!

287
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,375
And now for more news...

288
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,333
The president will be
holding a press conference

289
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,208
at the White House in
just a few minutes,

290
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,541
in response to the
recent scandal

291
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,666
What's my doctor
doing on TV?

292
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,791
Komori reporting.

293
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,000
We're live in Washington,

294
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,708
where every eye is on
the president today,

295
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,375
waiting to see
what he will do...

296
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,125
How will he respond to
the latest allegations?

297
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,125
Miss Komoe, what
are you doing?!

298
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,041
Excuse me but
we can't see.

299
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,250
He's flashing a confident
smile for the crowd.

300
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,625
Yes...!We...!Can!

301
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,750
And now Kuroko Shirai,
too...?

302
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,958
What's going on...?
This is getting ridiculous.

303
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,250
It's way too
involved for a prank.

304
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,708
There's no way they went
overseas to stage all this.

305
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,291
If this isn't a
practical joke...

306
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,291
Thank you, young man.

307
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,666
-Have a nice day,
-Good afternoon.

308
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,458
Let's see, here. First you wanna
head straight on up that hill...

309
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,291
Shana is so hot!

310
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,208
He's so lame.
And what's with his hair?

311
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,500
Do you think I should
block his number?

312
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,708
What is this...? What
the hell is going on?

313
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,458
Ah hah! I found you!

314
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,833
Oh, joy.

315
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,250
Here, take a look!

316
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,166
It's us from
last New Year's.

317
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,375
See, that's you and me.

318
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,541
Do you remember me now?

319
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,083
Please say you do.

320
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,708
Hey, is there
something wrong...?

321
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,916
You've been acting
seriously weird all day.

322
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,666
Let's see if
I've got this ...

323
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,833
You're saying this girl in the
picture with me is my cousin.

324
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,166
That's me all right...

325
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,000
Otohime Tatsugami.

326
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,375
That's weird.

327
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,666
She doesn't seem to realize

328
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,125
this isn't what
she looks like.

329
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,958
I don't understand...

330
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,375
It's like everybody's
personality

331
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,125
has been transplanted into
somebody else's body...

332
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,791
Even worse, no one
seems to know it...

333
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,208
How could that happen?

334
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,541
I know what's
going on here...

335
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,416
It's happened
enough lately.

336
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,958
Whenever somebody shows up in a
ridiculous costume like this,

337
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,333
they seem to know me...

338
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,666
even if I have no
idea who they are.

339
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,791
In this situation, I just
need to remain cool and casual.

340
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,083
Yo... long time no...

341
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,166
Question one...
are you the spell caster?

342
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,125
I'll repeat.

343
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,208
Are you the spell caster?

344
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,416
Hold on a minute.

345
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,625
It's too soon to conclude
that he's the one.

346
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,000
Whew...

347
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,166
Looks like we made
it just in time.

348
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,375
Tsuchimikado?!

349
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,375
Oh, and that's an
interesting development.

350
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,708
I look like Motoharu
Tsuchimikado to him.

351
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:37,125
Yes... however, the fact that
he can correctly identify you

352
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,208
might indicate that...

353
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,750
Oh, I don't think so,
sweetie...

354
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,166
Do you see any traces
of that on Kami's body?

355
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:47,250
It appears he has eluded
the problem, just as we have.

356
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,541
I am a sorcerer

357
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,666
with the English Puritan
Church's Necessarius...

358
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,166
Kaori Kanzaki.

359
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,500
Our purpose in coming here
is the same as yours:

360
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,666
to gauge the center
of the distortion...

361
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,625
However, it's ridiculous to
think that boy is the caster.

362
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,791
Russian Orthodox Church's
Annihilation Survey...

363
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,583
I'm Misha Kruezhev.

364
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,375
Wow...! Imagine meeting a member
of the Annihilation Survey

365
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,458
here at a beach resort.

366
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,708
Question one...

367
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,916
where is your proof that
he is not the caster...?

368
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,291
Question two...

369
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,375
if he is not the caster...
then who is?

370
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,958
Whoa, I don't understand a
word you guys have said...

371
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:26,291
and Tsuchimikado, what are
you doing here, anyway?

372
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,791
This boy is not
a sorcerer...

373
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:28,833
He's an esper...

374
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,500
a Level Zero, at that.

375
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,916
Hey! Hello! Are we just
skipping over the part

376
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,708
where she almost
cut my head off?!

377
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,208
Still annoying, I see...

378
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,208
Lucky me, I get to put up with
your whining all over again...

379
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,416
You haven't grown up even
a little bit, have you?

380
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,583
So she's someone
I know, too....

381
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,208
Maybe I can get
something out of her.

382
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,833
You know I would
really appreciate it

383
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,916
if you could at least tell
me what's going on here.

384
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,708
Just for old times' sake.

385
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,125
I guess I must...

386
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,166
It will be difficult
for us to move forward

387
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,458
unless the major players
understand the situation.

388
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,625
A major player...?

389
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,833
Does she mean me?

390
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,583
Currently, there is a
massive spell at work

391
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,166
on a global scale.

392
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,916
Its format and formula
are still unknown...

393
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,291
For the sake of convenience,
we have named it.

394
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,750
We are referring to
it as Angel Fall.

395
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,625
Angel Fall. Right.

396
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,208
"Sephirotic Tree"...

397
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,291
Have you heard that
term used before?

398
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,416
You might think of it as
a chart of rankings...

399
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,458
It shows the souls of Gods,
the angels, and humans...

400
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,458
Ordinarily, humans cannot
rise to the rank of angels...

401
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,500
Naturally, the opposite
is true as well.

402
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,791
You see, each ranking is
already filled to capacity.

403
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,125
However, one of the angels

404
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,791
has fallen to the
human level, going...

405
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:38,916
Time out!

406
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,791
Please. Time out for a second.

407
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:41,916
You don't understand?

408
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,666
That's hardly surprising.

409
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,041
No... I don't...
but, I mean, angels?

410
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,541
Are you messing with me?

411
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,041
Think about it, Kami.

412
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,750
You should have noticed the
effects of the spell by now.

413
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:51,791
They're pretty obvious.

414
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,333
What effects?

415
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,416
The switching of people's
appearances, for one.

416
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,125
Not everybody looks like
themselves, do they?

417
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,666
When the angel fell
to the human level,

418
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,875
the shift caused our world's
physical manifestations

419
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,916
and inner
workings to alter.

420
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,708
In a game of musical chairs,
the fastest one is the winner...

421
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,625
It's like that, with our
appearances scrambling

422
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,875
to sit down on our
"inner selves."

423
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,500
Oh... You mean that's why
everybody looks so funny?

424
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,458
There's still plenty
that we don't know...

425
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,750
It's not clear who put
this spell into motion

426
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,625
or what their
motivation was...

427
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,333
The important thing
right now, Kami...

428
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,458
is that you're at the
center of the distortion.

429
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,708
You are the prime suspect in
the casting of Angel Fall...

430
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,666
You narrowly escaped
the spell's effects...

431
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,958
Because of this,

432
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,291
your life will likely be
threatened by sorcerers

433
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,791
who are trying to
halt its progress.

434
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,958
However, I find it
impossible to believe

435
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,541
that Toma Kamijo
here is the culprit.

436
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,958
For one thing, he has no magical
knowledge whatsoever...

437
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,833
For another... the traces that
are left on espers' bodies

438
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:50,791
whenever they use magic are
nowhere to be found on him.

439
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,291
Counterargument one...

440
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,833
He is obviously not suffering
the effects of the spell.

441
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,125
That's easy to explain.

442
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,833
Kami has the ability
to cancel out

443
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,458
any extraordinary power...

444
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,958
Imagine Breaker has set up
residence in his right hand.

445
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,125
Oh, I see...
So that's why.

446
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,583
Wait, Tsuchimikado!

447
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,458
How do you even
know about that?

448
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:12,166
Valence reading... forty....
nine... thirty... and seven...

449
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,791
together that's
eighty-six.

450
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,375
Accordance....
Water, form a serpent

451
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,833
and strike at the target.

452
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:26,916
Very well...

453
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,708
I accept his
response as proof

454
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,791
that he should be cleared
of all suspicion...

455
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,083
Young man...
I hereby apologize

456
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,916
for mistakenly turning
my blade on you.

457
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,041
All right. Even though we
know you're not the caster,

458
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,375
the fact remains that Angel Fall
is centered around you

459
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,625
and still growing...

460
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:44,958
Which means that
there's a good chance

461
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,666
the caster is
somebody close to you.

462
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,458
It's hard to believe
that a single caster

463
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,125
is responsible for a spell
of this magnitude.

464
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,666
Most likely,
there's a ritual site

465
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,041
somewhere behind a magic
circle or barrier.

466
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,083
So, we either have to
destroy the ritual site

467
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,000
or the casters themselves...

468
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,125
Those are the
only two ways

469
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,000
we're gonna bring an
end to Angel Fall.

470
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,291
I still have a question.

471
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,250
What do you have to do
with this, Tsuchimikado...?

472
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,291
How are you involved
in the magic world...?

473
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,708
And how do you know
about Imagine Breaker?

474
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,166
Answer me, already!

475
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,750
It's a simple
explanation, really.

476
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:17,916
You see, Kami...

477
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,833
I'm a member of
Necessarius, too.
