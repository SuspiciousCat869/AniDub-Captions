1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,083
In order to stop
Angel Fall,

2
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,000
we must either defeat
the spell's caster

3
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,541
or destroy the site
of the ritual.

4
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,750
Suspicious of Misha's
recent behavior,

5
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,666
Tsuchimikado and I followed her
to my parents' new home,

6
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,083
where she had gone with my
mother earlier in the day.

7
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,083
However, when we arrived,

8
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,125
we found a surprise
waiting for us.

9
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:09,000
[Music]

10
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,500
Dad...

11
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,000
You're back, huh...?

12
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,083
Did your mother
come with you?

13
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:34,833
So, you saw the house...

14
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,833
What do you think
about our new place?

15
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,666
Why the long face, son?
Is something the matter...?

16
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,541
Have you and your mother gotten
into a fight, or something?

17
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,291
I wanna know why.

18
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,583
I want to know...

19
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,291
Why did you get involved
with the occult?

20
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,458
Whoa, slow down.
What are you--

21
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,291
Don't play dumb!

22
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,416
Yeah... I know you're
mixed up in sorcery,

23
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,291
now I wanna know
the reason why!

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,625
Oh, is that what
you meant...?...

25
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,125
Give me a second to think.

26
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,333
Where should I begin?

27
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,250
Toma.... think back a bit
to when you were a kid,

28
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,250
there was a nickname
everybody called you by.

29
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,416
You remember what it was?

30
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,958
Everybody called you... Jinx.

31
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,416
For whatever reason,
one unlucky thing

32
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,166
after another always
seemed to happen

33
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,583
when you were around.

34
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,791
At first it was just your
peers, but in time,

35
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,083
even adults started
giving you a wide berth.

36
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,000
That was the reason
I decided to send you

37
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:33,041
to school in Academy City.

38
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,083
All the superstitious
people who surrounded us

39
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:38,166
back home were
terrified of you.

40
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,583
So I sent you to a world
that was devoid

41
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,333
of such superstitions...

42
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,041
or so I thought.

43
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,583
However... even though you
were in a city of science...

44
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,375
you began to be treated
the same way you always

45
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,291
had been at home...

46
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,708
Clearly, science couldn't
rid you of your bad luck,

47
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,583
but I had to keep searching
for something that could.

48
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,166
And so, in a last desperate
move, I turned to the occult.

49
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,333
Ludicrous, isn't it...?

50
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,958
I was so determined to eliminate
other peoples' superstitions

51
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,708
that I found
some of my own.

52
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,000
You blind idiot.

53
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,208
Yeah... I've got
rotten luck, all right...

54
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,625
Even so...

55
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,958
It's a part of who I
am, and I accept that.

56
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,958
You should accept it, too.

57
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,291
I still have to
walk my own path,

58
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,333
despite whatever bad
luck may come my way.

59
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,041
You were happy...
just the way you were?

60
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,416
Well, you were right...
I was blind.

61
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,458
By trying to help,
instead I threatened

62
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,958
to take your happiness
away from you...

63
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,708
Of course, I think a part
of me always knew

64
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,666
that collecting all of
those good luck souvenirs

65
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,166
wasn't going to change anything
for you in the end, anyway.

66
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,833
Good luck souvenirs?

67
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,083
That's right...
but don't worry.

68
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,250
I'm gonna give up
souvenir hunting now.

69
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,125
Wait... What are you
talking about...?

70
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,458
You are the person
responsible for

71
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,375
bringing on Angel
Fall, aren't you?

72
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,250
I don't know this
"Angel Fall."

73
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,041
What country does that
souvenir come from?

74
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,708
I have one more
question...

75
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,166
Do you know where Mom is
right now? Answer honestly.

76
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,416
You're the one who
insisted on following her

77
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,708
to the new house...

78
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,833
You would've had
a better idea

79
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,875
of where she is than I would.

80
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,333
He isn't aware
of the switch...

81
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,583
Which means, he is under
the influence of Angel Fall.

82
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,958
Hey, Misha!

83
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,583
Thanks a lot...

84
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,208
I really appreciate you
keeping my wife company today.

85
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,166
I know why you're
here, but stop.

86
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,416
It's true that
Dad's appearance

87
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,625
hasn't been switched
with anyone else's...

88
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,125
I know that seems
suspicious,

89
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,458
but he hasn't noticed the
changes in anybody else, either

90
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,291
So couldn't that mean--
Response to question...

91
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,708
self-explanatory.

92
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,833
Target acquisition
completed.

93
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,500
Personal opinion one...

94
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,625
the solution to the
problem is simple.

95
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,708
Misha... stop.

96
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,333
You're not supposed to kill
anyone without a divine order.

97
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,125
Or have you forgotten
even that principle?

98
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,250
I'll be taking over now...

99
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,916
Please get your father
safely away from here

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,291
as quickly as you
can manage it.

101
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,708
Misha has the
wrong impression...

102
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,041
my father's not--

103
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,458
We've all been
tricked...

104
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,875
Her name isn't Misha.

105
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,375
I made an inquiry to
the Russian Church...

106
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,750
As it turns out, they only
have one Kruezhev on file,

107
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,291
and her name is Sasha.

108
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,250
This is probably
just an assumed form

109
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,166
that she switched into.

110
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,083
I don't understand
what you're saying...

111
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,541
If she's not a member of
the Russian Orthodox Church,

112
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,083
who is she?

113
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,416
There are beings in this
world without a fixed gender.

114
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,250
Rather, they are portrayed
in mythology as having

115
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,708
aspects of both male
and female within them.

116
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,458
They hold great power...

117
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,416
power far beyond the realm
of human understanding...

118
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,000
One would never
randomly choose

119
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,958
to swap identities
with another being.

120
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,625
Can you back up...? I'm
not really following this.

121
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,125
Stop and think
for a moment...

122
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,875
Have you forgotten the
name by which we refer

123
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,958
to this devastating spell?

124
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,875
What happened?
Where's the sun?

125
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,166
I see what she's doing.

126
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,333
By turning day into
night like this,

127
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,166
she's enhancing her power.

128
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,666
Controller of the blue,
symbol of the water.

129
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,958
Guardian of the moon,
protector of the rear side.

130
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,208
Her name is...

131
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,708
"The Power of God."

132
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,250
A sweep... a deluge
of flaming arrows

133
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,541
that has burned out
entire civilizations.

134
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,083
You fell from Heaven
unexpectedly,

135
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,958
and you desire to return.

136
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,375
And to do so, you are
willing to destroy

137
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,041
the entire world?

138
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,791
Well, we can't
let that happen.

139
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,041
What do you mean "we?"

140
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,125
She wouldn't touch my
right hand, remember...?

141
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,625
Why was that...?

142
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,666
It must mean that Imagine
Breaker works on angels, too.

143
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,416
No. From this point on,

144
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,916
the fight against her
does not involve you...

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,500
Your place isn't
here right now.

146
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,583
There's something
more important

147
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,125
that I need you
to do for me.

148
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,208
You and your father
must destroy

149
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,416
the ritual site
used for the spell.

150
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,541
Do that, and it will
no longer be necessary

151
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,500
for the Power of
God to kill Mr. oya

152
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,333
or unleash the sweep.

153
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,958
But there isn't much time.

154
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,208
Hurry, before the
formula's complete

155
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,166
and it's too late.

156
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,250
I can't leave you.

157
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,041
I'm not planning on
sacrificing myself,

158
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,500
if that's what you're
worried about...

159
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,958
I'm counting on you.

160
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,041
I've seen you save a girl
from death once before,

161
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,416
so I'd be grateful
if this time

162
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,125
my life was
the one you saved.

163
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,833
What is this, son...?
Please, what's going on?

164
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,166
All right, Kanzaki.
I'll leave it to you now.

165
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,375
Hey!

166
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,583
I hope you're ready, because
now you have to face me!

167
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,541
It has begun. I will
employ my Single Flash

168
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,000
and speak my name.

169
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,000
Salvare Zero zero zero!

170
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,833
Well, at this point,
things don't really

171
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,750
seem to be going our way.

172
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,791
Sorry about this, Kami.

173
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,458
We've got a tough
decision to make.

174
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,291
It looks like we have to
offer someone as sacrifice

175
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,875
if we want to get this
situation under control.

176
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,750
What I'm doing is nothing
short of reckless...

177
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,916
I myself am aligned to
the church of the cross...

178
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,333
How can I hope
to destroy an angel

179
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,958
who is similarly aligned?

180
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,791
I must!

181
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,166
Fortunately, I am no
ordinary member

182
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,750
of the Church of the Cross.

183
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,416
I am one of the
Amakusa Puritans,

184
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,458
the independent form
of the church in Japan,

185
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,708
born from the intolerance
of the Edo period.

186
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,958
Amakusa Puritanism is a fusion
of several diverse religions.

187
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,083
Christianity
had been banned.

188
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,000
They merged their faith
with Shinto and Buddhism

189
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,333
to mask their beliefs
and avoid persecution.

190
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,000
A normal Church
of the Cross member

191
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,541
may not be able to
defeat an angel,

192
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,666
but one of the Japanese
Shinto sect can!

193
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,250
Japanese Shinto
is polytheistic.

194
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,750
Interestingly, it even
contains certain forms

195
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,041
for countering a god.

196
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,833
Included in the religion's
commandments

197
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,916
is the instruction never
to cause harm to a god.

198
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,750
Why would such a
law be necessary...?

199
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,083
Unless, of course,
someone had tried it before.

200
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,416
It makes no sense that I'm
still relatively unharmed

201
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,875
after facing an angel.

202
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,666
If this keeps up, it's going
to become a war of attrition.

203
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,791
And meanwhile, the sweep
will be carried out.

204
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,958
Please succeed in
this, Toma Kamijo.

205
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,916
Put a stop to Angel Fall
before it's too late!

206
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,166
What's wrong...?
Come on, wake up!

207
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,541
She's sleeping too deeply.
Did someone drug her?

208
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,708
Why would anybody do
such a thing to her?

209
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,208
Toma!

210
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,625
Would you explain
all this...?

211
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,458
Tell me what on earth
is going on here!

212
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,250
Listen carefully...

213
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,541
The way things stand, a
lot of people are gonna die...

214
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,000
The only way to
stop that from happening

215
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,125
is if we cancel
out Angel Fall.

216
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,791
I still don't understand
what you're saying.

217
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,791
-What is Angel Fall
-Areyou still playing dumb? !

218
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,541
At least show me where
the ritual site is hidden!

219
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,875
You've got it wrong,
Kami. Put him down.

220
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,750
Tsuchimikado?

221
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,458
Haven't you figured out
what's going on here yet?

222
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,083
Well... I guess
I can't blame you...

223
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,958
You're still pretty new
to all this magic stuff.

224
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,000
Wait... What do you mean?
Figured out what truth?

225
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,833
You mean my dad isn't
responsible for all this?

226
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,458
He isn't the one who
activated Angel Fall?

227
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,708
Not exactly.

228
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,541
Toya Kamijo is most
definitely the culprit.

229
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:30,500
However, he is completely
unaware of having done anything.

230
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,375
But how is that
possible...?

231
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,541
I thought you needed
a large ritual site...

232
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,208
that that was the only
way to invoke Angel Fall.

233
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,833
Yes. We already found
the ritual site...

234
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,708
It's your parents'
new house, Kami...

235
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,125
All the good luck charms,
the folk art, the statues,

236
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,541
the occult goods...

237
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,166
Individually, they have
no real significance ...

238
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,541
but if they're all
placed in the correct

239
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,916
feng shui arrangement,
it's a very different story.

240
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,166
When that happens, they
create a synergistic effect

241
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,458
and become a single,
immense power.

242
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,375
For example, remember
the red post box

243
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,208
that was in the foyer?

244
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,250
Red is an attribute
of the south...

245
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,625
Also, there was a water
guardian turtle

246
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,083
in the bathroom...

247
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,625
And metal guardian
white tigers

248
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,791
on the kitchen
counter, as well.

249
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,541
Add in three thousand
good luck charms

250
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,708
your dad had collected
from all over the world,

251
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,833
and suddenly your ordinary
house becomes a temple.

252
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,958
Strange as it sounds, when
your parents came to the beach

253
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,625
and left the house empty, the
ritual ground was complete...

254
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,041
it must have activated.

255
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,041
So, my dad built
it by accident?

256
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,625
Yes... it was a
simple accident...

257
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,708
Angel Fall is nothing more
than a spell created

258
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,708
by the coincidental
arrangement of some objects.

259
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,958
If we had interfered with the
set-up while we were there,

260
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,083
we could have invoked an
even more dangerous spell.

261
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,291
In order to cancel out the
magic of the ritual site,

262
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,791
we have to destroy the
whole thing in one go...

263
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,333
If we cannot...

264
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,500
then we'll have to destroy
the caster... my dad.

265
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,500
An unfortunate
situation...

266
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,708
but what else can we do...?

267
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,833
After all, I
can't use my magic.

268
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,083
In times like this,
the English Puritan Church

269
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,791
gives its followers some
very unsavory instructions.

270
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,250
I'm sorry, but
it's my job.

271
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,666
No, I won't let you!

272
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,958
Back off, Kami...

273
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,750
You'll just get
yourself hurt.

274
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,125
Toma, what is this? !

275
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,416
Stay behind me!

276
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,791
I don't accept this...

277
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,708
The church thinks they
can demand my dad be used

278
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,375
as a human sacrifice
to stop Angel Fall?

279
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,666
Well, that's too bad. They've
got another thing coming!

280
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,625
Toma!

281
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,708
It's over. Ya might
as well stay down there.

282
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,000
Wanna do something to me...?

283
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,541
then, by all means,
have at it...

284
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,208
But don't do anything
else to hurt my son!

285
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,708
Oh?

286
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,083
I'm dead serious.

287
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,041
If you harm so much as
another hair on Toma's head,

288
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,333
I swear you're
going to regret it!

289
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,000
Now you're just
bein' silly...

290
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,208
You can't actually believe
you'd be able to take me.

291
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,291
You're right. I don't...

292
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,041
I may not win,
but if you hurt Toma,

293
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,208
I'll inflict as much pain on
you as I can before I go down.

294
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,875
Have I made myself
clear enough...?

295
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,250
I am Toma's father.

296
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,625
Anyone who threatens
him will answer to me!

297
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,375
Don't do it, Dad.

298
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,875
Don't, get involved
Toma...! It's useless.

299
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,208
If you try to protect me,

300
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,791
none of us are getting
out of this mess alive.

301
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,625
That isn't true Dad!

302
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,916
I don't care
what it takes.

303
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,791
We are gonna
survive this...

304
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,541
'cause whatever happens,
I'm my father's son.

305
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,666
That's my boy...

306
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,583
If that's how this is
gonna play out, so be it...

307
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,125
I think we should make
it formal, don't you?

308
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,958
As of now, Toma
Kamijo is officially

309
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,583
the enemy of
Motoharu Tsuchimikado.

310
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,375
What d'you say...?
Had enough yet?

311
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,208
Toma!

312
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,291
-Dad...
-Takes care of that.

313
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,000
All right, everybody.

314
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,875
Prepare yourselves for
an amazing display

315
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,958
of honest-to-goodness
sorcery.

316
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,500
This room will act as our
humble stage for today.

317
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,208
The first order of business
is properly setting the stage.

318
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,625
With that taken care of,

319
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,041
allow me to introduce
you to my magic troupe.

320
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,000
Time to get to
work, you guys.

321
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,125
Suzaku...

322
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,875
Seiryu...

323
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,250
Genbu...

324
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,166
Byakko...

325
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,125
The pistol has
been assembled...

326
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:30,375
but we still need to
see about loading it.

327
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,166
Sorcery?

328
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,458
The spell we're
performing is like a gun:

329
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,625
made up of individual parts,

330
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,458
each with a
different function...

331
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,750
For the barrel of the
gun, we have a barrier.

332
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,791
For the bullet, we have
a shikigami spirit.

333
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,583
What's he doing...?

334
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,666
I thought Tsuchimikado said
he couldn't use magic anymore.

335
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,125
And for the trigger, I'll
be using my own hand.

336
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,125
Remember what
I said, Kami?

337
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,083
There's more than
one way to skin a cat

338
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,250
and the same goes
for Angel Fall...

339
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,250
One option is to kill
the spell's caster...

340
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,708
and the other is to
destroy the magic circle.

341
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,041
No, don't.

342
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,041
You know, Kami, when you
say stuff like that,

343
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,833
you remind me a
lot of Kanzaki...

344
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,458
If she knew I was
doing things this way,

345
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,958
she would do everything
in her power to stop me.

346
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,833
Exactly like you would...

347
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,291
I had to find a way to
prevent you from interfering.

348
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,875
Unfortunately, that meant
I had to beat you up ...

349
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,166
but let's look at the
bright side, shall we...?

350
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,916
Now I can use my magic to blow
the whole ritual site away.

351
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,541
Just stop it...

352
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,000
You don't have to do this.

353
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,541
I'm afraid I can't grant
that particular request, sorry.

354
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,541
If there's something you
should know about me by now...

355
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,375
it's that I'm a
big, fat liar.

356
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,291
I don't know how you managed
to do it, Toma Kamijo...

357
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,083
but now I owe
you another one.

358
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,083
Dad...! Wake up...! Dad!

359
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,083
Tsuchimikado...

360
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,625
There had to
be another way.

361
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,166
There had to be...

362
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,458
What good could
sacrificing yourself

363
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,541
like that do anybody?

364
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,666
Hey, what's
happening, Kami?

365
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,250
Long time no see.

366
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,916
You been hangin'
in there all right?

367
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,541
Huh? ... What's wrong...?

368
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,166
You're white as a sheet.

369
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,041
You look like you've
just seen a ghost.

370
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,375
How can you be here?

371
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,291
You used magic again and
you died, didn't you?

372
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,791
Ahh...

373
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,666
-that was a lie.
-Huh? !

374
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,875
My esper power is
Auto Regeneration.

375
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,375
I'm a Level Zero, but
I can still restore my body...

376
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,375
Between you and me,
I think I can use magic

377
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,833
a few more times
before I keel over.

378
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,208
It's kind of a pain
to explain it all,

379
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,500
so I just didn't bother.

380
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,916
Really? That's your reason?

381
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,625
How many more times
do I have to tell you

382
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,708
before you believe
me: I am a liar...

383
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,375
That bit about sneaking
into Academy City

384
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,250
to do spy work was a lie...

385
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,375
In reality, I'm a counter
spy and only pretending

386
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,458
to be on the side of the
English Puritan Church.

387
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,791
Actually, to tell the
truth, that's a lie, too...!

388
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,250
In fact, I'm a
freelance spy

389
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,041
hired by multiple
agencies for espionage.

390
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,416
Why, you little...

391
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,916
Oh, come on,
don't be like that.

392
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,083
All's well that
ends well, right...?

393
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,083
But, I thought you
might react that way,

394
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,000
so I brought some folks
along to help cheer you up.

395
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,583
I'm telling
you, it's true!

396
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,541
Hitotsui Hajime was standing
right there in the house!

397
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,666
It's my mom... for real.

398
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,041
How are you
feeling, Toma dear?

399
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,250
Uh...

400
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,708
okay, I guess...

401
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,500
I mean, I'm starting to
get kinda used to being here.

402
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,208
Oh my goodness, dear...

403
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,375
We can't have you
getting used to being

404
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,500
hospitalized, can we?

405
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,166
Good to see you, son...

406
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm glad you're
looking better now.

407
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,458
Thanks, Dad...

408
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,166
You look better, too.

409
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,500
Well, our house is
completely gone now,

410
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,000
but I consider that a small
price to pay for your safety.

411
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,458
Huh? ...

412
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,500
What did you say...?
What's wrong with the house?

413
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,916
You know how we built a
new house just a while ago?

414
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,458
Well, apparently
it was blown to pieces

415
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,625
in some mysterious explosion.

416
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,208
Where'd Tsuchimikado go?

417
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,000
Well, these things
do happen...

418
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,458
It's not so big
a deal, really.

419
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,708
We can just stay
in the old house

420
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,583
until we can get
the new one rebuilt.

421
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:21,625
You guys still
have the old one?

422
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,208
Sort of...

423
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,291
We were just renting it
from somebody all these years...

424
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,958
but fortunately, they
haven't re-let it yet.

425
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,250
We may not have owned it,
but it was still our home.

426
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,625
We lived there from the
time we got married up

427
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,416
until we built
the new place.

428
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,875
You remember.

429
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,166
You were always groaning
about how cramped it was.

430
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,166
Yeah, that's right.

431
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,916
Toma...

432
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,625
Oh, hey, Index.
Is something wrong...?

433
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,791
Why are you just peeking
around the wall like that?

434
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,666
Yes something's wrong...

435
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,500
You strangled me
with your bare hands.

436
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,916
At the beach, you buried me
in the sand up to my neck.

437
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,041
Um... I promise I had a good
reason for doing all of that.

438
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,041
Then you nearly smooshed
me to death behind a door.

439
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,833
No fair! That one wasn't me!

440
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:11,708
I was on the floor in pain
and you just ignored me!

441
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,083
Uh, yeah, I guess
that one was me...

442
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,166
I mean--! Well... you see...

443
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,458
Damn my luck!

444
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:38,750
[Music]

445
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,041
A kid named Unabara
starts pestering Mikoto.

446
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,458
To keep him away,

447
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,666
she asks me to pretend
I'm her boyfriend.

448
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,916
Wait, me on a date
with bug zapper?

449
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,708
Next time, "Replica."

450
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:09,958
When science and magic cross
paths, a story is born.
