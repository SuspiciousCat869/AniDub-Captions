00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,583
The 3rd-ranked esper
in all of Academy City

2
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:38,041
is a human bug zapper otherwise
known as Mikoto Misaka.

3
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,583
Apparently, we were
acquaintances

4
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,333
before I lost my memory...

5
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,625
Now, I've also met
her younger sister.

6
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,375
The two of them have
me very confused...

7
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,833
I can't help feeling
there's more going on here

8
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,833
than meets the eye.

9
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:58,125
[Music]

10
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,041
What are you running
away like that for?

11
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,875
Don't get me wrong,
I do appreciate the view.

12
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,250
You've got such
a cute little ass.

13
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,666
Answer me this.

14
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,166
What technique was
it that I just used?

15
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,708
Which of my skills did I
elect to turn against you?

16
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,458
Reflection...

17
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,166
Too bad.... You
were close,

18
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,416
but I'm afraid that's not
this particular technique.

19
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,166
No... The right answer is
vector transformation.

20
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,083
It could be anything:
kinetic energy...

21
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,958
heat... an
electrical charge...

22
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,000
whatever vector comes in
contact with my skin,

23
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,416
I can transform.

24
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,750
In all fairness though,

25
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,458
reflection is
usually my default.

26
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,083
Now then, let's return
to our little match.

27
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,958
Right now, the vector
I'm in contact with

28
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,625
is the heat from
your blood.

29
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,583
Use your imagination
for me...

30
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,833
What d'you suppose
would happen

31
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,625
if I reversed
your blood flow?

32
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,666
Answer the question
correctly,

33
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,041
and then you can rest...

34
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,000
In pieces.

35
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,500
Where is she?

36
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:33,750
Hey, it's okay, buddy.

37
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,708
I wasn't gone long.

38
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,458
So where did she
wander off to?

39
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,708
Misaka...?! How...?

40
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,208
You there...

41
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,083
You called it in?

42
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,041
If you think
you're up to it,

43
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,541
we'd like you to take us to the
spot where you found the body...

44
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,000
Do you think you
can do that now?

45
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,708
Yeah, let's go.

46
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,208
Hey, kid!

47
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,916
Something the matter?

48
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,625
It's just... this is
where I found her body...

49
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,375
I swear it was right here.

50
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,708
Huh...?

51
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,125
Hey... Uh, yeah.

52
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,125
Sorry kid, there just
isn't anything here.

53
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,708
But there was.

54
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,125
The body of a young
girl was in this alley.

55
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,916
What's going on?

56
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,041
What the hell
is happening...?

57
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,125
I don't--!

58
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,958
Hey, get back here!

59
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,750
What the hell is this?

60
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,666
"I am sorry about this.

61
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,500
It was my intention to
meet back with you after

62
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,416
I completed the operation,"

63
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,666
Misaka apologizes with
complete sincerity.

64
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,458
Hey, hold on...

65
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,000
You are the younger sister
of Misaka, aren't you...?

66
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,083
You're alive...! So what
was that I saw before?

67
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,416
Sorry... I need a minute
to collect myself.

68
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,166
Until a second ago, I
thought I'd found your body.

69
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,875
I guess I was wrong...

70
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,625
I'm glad to know
you're okay.

71
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,250
"No, you were correct
about Misaka's death,

72
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,083
"Misaka calmly reports.

73
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,625
What are you
carrying that bag?

74
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:20,041
"Before saying more, I must
verify your password,"

75
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,916
Misaka states,
as she was instructed to.

76
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,708
"ZXC-741-ASD-852-QWE-963,"

77
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:29,958
asks Misaka, testing you.

78
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,750
Uh, what the--?

79
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,000
"It does not appear you are
able to decode the password...

80
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,208
and given that fact,

81
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,791
you are clearly not part
of this experiment,"

82
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,041
Misaka is forced
to evaluate.

83
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,833
What exactly do you
have there in that bag?

84
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,958
"The bag contains
sisters,"

85
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,125
Answers Misaka,
matter-of-factly.

86
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,416
"I must apologize for
leaving the black cat

87
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,875
behind with you,"
Misaka says regretfully.

88
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,083
"But I did not feel
right bringing him...

89
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,875
A battle between humans is
no place for an animal,"...

90
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,208
Misaka justifies
her actions.

91
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,083
"I appear to have
caused undue concern...

92
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,708
That is an unfortunate
result of the experiment,"...

93
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,666
Misaka says, apologizing.

94
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,583
But you truly needn't
have worried...

95
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,375
I came here to explain......

96
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,291
there is nothing amiss.

97
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,750
You see, we are many.

98
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,500
All Misakas
here are Misaka.

99
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,750
What the hell are you? !

100
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,083
"Up to now, you have had
contact with one Misaka...

101
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,250
Serial number 10032.

102
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,166
I am that Misaka.

103
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,125
The Misakas all have
the esper ability

104
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,916
to control electricity...

105
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,291
Additionally, our brainwaves

106
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,041
are all linked
to each other...

107
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,750
Therefore, all Misakas
share the memories

108
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,583
of Misaka 10032,"

109
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,625
Misaka continues to explain.

110
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,583
That's fine...

111
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,083
But who are you?

112
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,666
"We are cellular clones
mass-produced

113
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,166
for military purposes...

114
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,500
The original donor
is Mikoto Misaka,

115
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,666
one of only seven Level 5
espers in Academy City...

116
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,791
We are her sisters,
"Misaka further explains.

117
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,291
Is that so...? Then
what are you doing here?

118
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,958
"We are performing
an experiment,"...

119
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,458
Misaka restates calmly.

120
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,041
"The details
are top-secret,

121
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,958
so I cannot
explain further...

122
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,666
however, it is nothing for you
to be concerned about,"

123
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,333
Misaka continues
reassuringly.

124
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,041
"Please accept my sincere
apologies for provoking

125
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,625
your brief involvement
in this experiment,"...

126
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,916
Misaka requests
with her head bowed.

127
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,041
I'd appreciate it if
you'd look after Dog.

128
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,416
An experiment?
For the military?

129
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,958
More importantly...
what are you doing here

130
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,833
in the first place?

131
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,416
Misaka has a schedule--

132
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,791
It's okay!

133
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,625
Come with me.

134
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,250
That did seem weird.

135
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,208
Is it possible that she
knows about all this?

136
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,666
It all looks delicious!

137
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,000
Indeed.

138
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,625
Since you dropped
by uninvited,

139
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,666
perhaps you would
like to serve.

140
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,083
Go on.... Hop to it, now.

141
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,666
Cook up some yummy
meat for Teacher

142
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,000
like a good little girl.

143
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,708
Very well.

144
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,125
But first, there is
something you should know...

145
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,625
A scary fact concerning
this very meal

146
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,166
we are about to have.

147
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,416
Oh, please...! How could
anything possibly be

148
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,666
scary about this
wonderful meal?

149
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,666
That same meat over which
you are salivating...

150
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,458
Has been proven to
contain carcinogens.

151
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,083
What...? I've never heard
anything about that before.

152
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,416
Where are you getting
your information from?

153
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,875
I see what you're up to!

154
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,583
You're trying to frighten
me away from eating the meat

155
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,208
so you can have
it all to yourself!

156
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,875
It sounds like
we have company.

157
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,916
It's probably just a
door-to-door salesman.

158
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,583
Be a dear, Himegami, and
get rid of him for me

159
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,000
as politely as you can...

160
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,333
While you do that,

161
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,875
I'm going to get this
meat cooked to perfection.

162
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,750
Maybe I'll save you some.

163
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,500
So... so hungry--

164
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,750
What was that...?

165
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,625
Who was at the door, Himegami?

166
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,291
No one... It's
nobody at all.

167
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,041
Have a heart... The least
you can do is feed him...

168
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,833
Just look at
his sweet face.

169
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,000
Toma hasn't seen fit
to come home yet.

170
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,041
I swear, I was just
about to starve to death!

171
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh, don't worry...

172
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,000
Feeding one more
mouth is no big deal.

173
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,541
We have a fair
amount of meat,

174
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,500
and we can always fill up on
these lovely vegetables as well.

175
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,333
Fantastic...!

176
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,666
I want meat...!
I want meat...! I want meat!

177
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,125
Next stop,
School District 7...

178
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,416
Tokiwadai Middle
School Student Dorms.

179
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,500
Let's see...

180
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,958
Oh.

181
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,333
So she's in room 208.

182
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,083
Okay...

183
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,500
What are you planning
to say when you see her?

184
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,666
"So, Mikoto, do you
know anything about this

185
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,833
military experiment where
they're killing

186
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,458
off clones of you...?"

187
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,166
Yes?

188
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,666
Um... yeah, hi...

189
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,208
is Misaka there...?

190
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,500
This is Toma... Kamijo.

191
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,666
Hmm... What was that...?

192
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,375
Kamijo, was it?

193
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,708
Ah. No... my mistake...

194
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:00,833
I must have
the wrong room.

195
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,083
Sorry to bother you!

196
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,666
No, no, it's all right.

197
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,541
I live here, too...

198
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,083
I'm Sissy's roommate.

199
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,833
Oh, are you really?

200
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,416
Yes, I most certainly am!

201
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,500
Hang on...

202
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,541
I've heard that voice
somewhere before.

203
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,958
Hold on...

204
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,125
I think I recognize your
voice from somewhere.

205
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,041
It's you...! You're
the boy Sissy

206
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,625
had a clandestine
meeting with!

207
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,916
Explain yourself! What
do you want with her?

208
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,666
Oh, it's nothing
really that important.

209
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,083
If it's not important,

210
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,875
then why did you make the
trip all the way down here?

211
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,000
You know what...

212
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,000
if she's not
there, never mind.

213
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,958
At this point, Sissy
has not returned home.

214
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,666
If you need to see her so
badly that you showed up here,

215
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,833
why don't you
come in and wait?

216
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,791
This is what the
directory said...

217
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,291
Room 208.

218
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,666
Come in... It's all right;

219
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,208
the door isn't locked.

220
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,750
I'm sorry for
disturbing you--

221
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,291
As I suspected, the
boy from before

222
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,458
Um... yeah that's me.

223
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,083
Have you two been engaging
in extracurricular activities?

224
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,875
No, nothing like that!

225
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,333
That's good to hear...

226
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,166
and you certainly don't
look like you came here

227
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,500
hoping for an amorous
tryst with anybody.

228
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,833
There's no telling how long
you'll be waiting for her.

229
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,708
You might as well have
a seat over on the bed.

230
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,375
Uh, no, thank you.

231
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,666
I couldn't do that...

232
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,250
Not without
her permission.

233
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,708
If that's what you're
worried about, don't bother.

234
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,125
That's my bed.

235
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,833
Then that one
belongs to Misaka?

236
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,958
What are you doing on
somebody else's bed...?

237
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,250
Are you some
kind of pervert?

238
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,875
You're here at an
all-girls dorm

239
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,625
and you call me a pervert?

240
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,708
Everyone has their own
personal preferences.

241
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,250
They may seem strange
to other people,

242
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,583
but that doesn't make
them wrong or perverted.

243
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,666
Come on, like you never
secretly pressed your lips

244
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,166
to your crush's picture...

245
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,583
or stole the seat from
her bicycle to caress.

246
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:10,916
No I haven't! Ah...

247
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,583
You are crazy...

248
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,208
Is this really what goes
on behind the scenes

249
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,041
at the all-girls' dormitory?

250
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,916
Come to think of it,
if you share a room,

251
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,041
doesn't that make
you classmates...?

252
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,458
The way you keep
calling her Sissy,

253
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,750
it sounds more like a
nickname for an upperclassman.

254
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,291
You were right...
She is older than I am,

255
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,583
though that's not really
why I call her Sissy.

256
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,708
I'm actually a full
year behind her.

257
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,458
Yet you're roommates?

258
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,083
I saw to it that her previous
roommate was reassigned.

259
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,416
Then I took
her place here.

260
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,791
It was simple
enough to do.

261
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,833
It was all totally
legal of course.

262
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,333
Sissy has a lot of enemies
around here, you know...

263
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,583
It's the price she pays
for being powerful...

264
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,208
but I couldn't bear
the idea of someone

265
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,208
as close to her as a
roommate betraying her,

266
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,791
so I felt steps
needed to be taken.

267
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,875
I saw you with
her yesterday...

268
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,500
I believe you when you say
you're not her boyfriend.

269
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,833
So what, then?

270
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,875
Does she have some kind
of quarrel with you?

271
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,125
You wouldn't be
the first person

272
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,708
she didn't get
along with...

273
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,333
Someone with her kind of ability
is bound to make enemies.

274
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,875
Though I would like
it if she had a few more people

275
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,500
to support her.

276
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,041
Support her how?

277
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,791
Is that her out there?

278
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,583
Those footsteps
sound more like...

279
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,666
This isn't good!

280
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,375
The head resident is
here to do a bed check!

281
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,750
What are we
going to do...?

282
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,583
If they find a boy
in the girls' dormitory

283
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,958
at this time of night,

284
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,333
there's going to
be big trouble!

285
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,500
I'll just have to teleport
you outside 'til she's done.

286
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,375
I don't get it.
My power isn't working!

287
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,208
Why doesn't it
work on you?

288
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,708
Well, you see...

289
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,750
There's this thing
about my right hand...

290
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,375
We don't have any
other choice...

291
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,458
Get down there...

292
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,916
You have to hide
underneath the bed!

293
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,833
It won't work.
There's not enough space!

294
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,166
Just do it!

295
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,000
No wonder it's crowded.

296
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,791
Shirai... it's past
time for supper...

297
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,625
Come down to the
dining hall......

298
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,250
Where is Misaka?

299
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,291
Sissy went to her
remedial lesson...

300
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,666
Perhaps it's
running a bit long.

301
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,875
I haven't heard
anything about that...

302
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,708
If she breaks curfew then,
as her roommate,

303
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,500
you will be
punished as well...

304
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,291
Do I make myself
understood?

305
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,166
Yes... I understand, ma'am.

306
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,916
A zipper?

307
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,791
Sisters...

308
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,541
Level 6...

309
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,000
"Based upon the
predictive calculations

310
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,458
made by Tree Diagram,

311
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,958
it has been
established that

312
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,000
only one person has the ability
to reach status Level 6."

313
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,125
"Specific backgrounds
will be prepared,

314
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,416
and a battle
schedule will be set.

315
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,833
Development will be
stimulated by actual combat."

316
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,833
She's been playing me.

317
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,875
Where is she...?

318
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,041
Where would she go?

319
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,583
The propellers are turning, but
there isn't any wind tonight.

320
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:48,875
The turning
of the propellers

321
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,041
is usually used to
generate electricity.

322
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,666
Then, conversely, couldn't
electricity be used

323
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,125
to make the propellers turn?

324
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,541
There are electromagnetic waves
constantly emanating from her.

325
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,208

326

327
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:59,458
The report I found contains

328
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,791
Misaka is pushed
to the breaking point

329
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,583
by her sisters' cruel fate.

330
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,291
If only I could
help somehow.

331
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,916
Next time, "Level 6."

332
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,958
When science and magic cross
paths, a story is born.
