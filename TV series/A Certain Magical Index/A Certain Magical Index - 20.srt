1
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,208
A Misaka Sister
nicknamed "Last Order"

2
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,416
approached Accelerator
seeking his help.

3
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,916
He later learned that a virus
had been implanted in her head

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,958
by a man named Ao Amai.

5
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,416
If the virus is triggered,

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,583
ten thousand Sisters will
launch an attack on humanity.

7
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,541
What is he going to do?

8
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,000
Wait, I don't have any scenes
in this episode, either?

9
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:57,208
[Music]

10
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,458
Accelerator.

11
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,916
That's me now, but I used
to have a normal name.

12
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,666
A first and last name...

13
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,041
Like everybody else.

14
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,541
It wasn't even a
particularly unusual name.

15
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,375
Ridiculous.

16
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,625
The virus that
I've isolated

17
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:13,708
is set to trigger at midnight
tonight, September 1st...

18
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,041
If it does activate,
it will run rampant,

19
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,750
spreading through the
entire Misaka Network

20
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,916
and infecting all
the Sisters...

21
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,250
Once that happens, there
will be no stopping it...

22
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,500
We'll be helpless.

23
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,375
What...?!
A man in a lab coat?!

24
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,958
Well... yes...

25
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,625
He said he was
related to her...

26
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,083
he was an uncle
or something...

27
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,458
so we thought it was okay
to let her leave with him.

28
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,583
So, um...

29
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,416
is he an acquaintance
of yours, then?

30
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,875
Unfortunately he is.

31
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,458
He did what?!

32
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,916
So...

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,666
the virus is designed to
activate on its own, right?

34
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,125
If that's the case,

35
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,291
why would he make a
move on the kid now?

36
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,708
That's just one question
I wish I could answer.

37
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:03,041
It's possible that he's already
left Academy City, isn't it?

38
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,500
There are any number
of organizations

39
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,416
that would hide him.

40
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,250
Word is that somebody
from the outside

41
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,333
broke through
the security net.

42
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,083
Whoever it was then
slipped into the city.

43
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,250
The Security Code was set
at orange earlier today...

44
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,250
but it's been
elevated to red now.

45
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,708
Nobody is allowed to enter
or leave Academy City...

46
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,875
Which means that Amai should
still be here somewhere.

47
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:26,958
Hotels wouldn't be safe.

48
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,291
He must be hiding
at a friend's place.

49
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,250
I'd be surprised if
there's anybody left

50
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,250
he could call a friend.

51
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,708
I see what you mean...

52
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,458
He's scum, just like me.

53
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,083
With the closure
of the laboratory,

54
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,000
he's incurred quite
a lot of debt.

55
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,125
I'd guess his
friendships only last

56
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,958
as long as his
money holds out.

57
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,208
Huh...

58
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,791
If he has nowhere
to set up camp,

59
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,833
then he's probably still
prowling around town somewhere.

60
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,333
And I have an advantage.

61
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,125
He's cornered.
A lack of breathing room

62
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,833
tends to make peoples' actions
much more predictable.

63
00:04:58,916 --> 00:04:59,875
Hold on a minute...

64
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:00,875
You're not going to...

65
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,083
Damn it...!

66
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,833
Nothing's going
my way tonight!

67
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,375
Please... just
a little longer.

68
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,791
Just stay alive 'til
the virus activates!

69
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,125
I have you...

70
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,291
Now what should
I do with you?

71
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,250
You should take it
easy, old man...

72
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,875
You're embarrassing yourself.

73
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,333
Hey, Yoshikawa...
Are you there...?

74
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,125
Yeah, I've got the
kid secured now...

75
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,166
Wait...

76
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,125
Hey... it looks like she's
hooked up to some electrodes.

77
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,125
That's probably one of
the physical exam kits

78
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,750
we use on the Sisters.

79
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,291
Can you tell me what a
BC operating ratio is?

80
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,875
It measures the rate at which
her brain is functioning...

81
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,166
BC stands for brain cell.

82
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,083
These numbers aren't
looking so good.

83
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,958
So... do you think I can use
this physical exam kit thing

84
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,583
to get rid of the virus...?

85
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,166
It could take a
long time for me

86
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,500
to get her back to the
laboratory from here.

87
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,000
Impossible...

88
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,583
We need a specialized incubator
and a learning apparatus

89
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,083
to overwrite her mind.

90
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,208
Huh...? Where are you...?

91
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,416
Driving?

92
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,750
Yes.

93
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,083
I'm on the road right now.

94
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,833
Headed toward
you as we speak.

95
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,500
I thought I could buy us
some extra time this way...

96
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,041
It's quicker than you
taking her back to the lab.

97
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,333
Are you done analyzing
the virus code?

98
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,791
I'd say I'm about
80% there...

99
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,333
I'll be finished before
the midnight deadline.

100
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,958
Honestly...

101
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,208
how much trouble does this
kid wanna cause me...?

102
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,083
This is getting old, fast.

103
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,083
Mi... sa...

104
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,875
Misa... ka. Misa... ka.

105
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,166
Misaka. Misaka. Misaka.

106
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,583
Misa misa misa
misa misa misa....

107
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,333
Um, Yoshikawa...

108
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,666
What the hell is going on?

109
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,041
Quiet a second.

110
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,291
Yeah, that's it, all right...

111
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,833
but it shouldn't
be happening yet.

112
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,208
What is it?
What's happening?

113
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,416
The implanted virus code...

114
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,208
From the sound of it,
it's getting ready to execute.

115
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,291
I don't understand
why it's happening...

116
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,291
We still have four
hours 'til midnight.

117
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,583
This could mean we were
fed false information.

118
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,000
Damn it.

119
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,208
Listen up, Accelerator.

120
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,375
It's too soon to give up...

121
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,833
but you've gotta move
quickly, all right?

122
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,750
What...? You mean there's
something I can do?

123
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,791
Before the virus is distributed
throughout the Misaka Network,

124
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,666
it's being converted
into a host command,

125
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,500
which none of the Sisters
will be able to contradict.

126
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,833
That will take about
ten minutes to complete...

127
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,833
That should be
enough time...

128
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,250
You know there's only
one thing you can do.

129
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,041
Dispose of Last Order.

130
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,458
It's the only way...

131
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,250
Save the world
by killing her.

132
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,333
Damn.

133
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,625
I'm the strongest esper
in Academy City...

134
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,541
but as powerful
as my abilities are,

135
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,666
they're only good for
altering vector directions.

136
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,166
What's more...

137
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,250
I've pretty much only used
them for beating people up...

138
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,791
I don't know how
to do any healing.

139
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:38,875
Sure, I can touch someone

140
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,083
and reverse the
flow of their blood

141
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,833
and mess with their
bioelectricity, but...

142
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,083
Wait... what was that?

143
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,708
I feel like there's
an idea here...

144
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,000
I have to think.

145
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,250
Bioelectricity...

146
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,166
That's it!

147
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,708
This data stick
could be the key.

148
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,875
It contains Last Order's
personality data

149
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,083
from before she was infected.

150
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,041
Hey, listen...

151
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,458
What if I can
get control over

152
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,083
the electrical signals
in her brain...?

153
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,250
Wouldn't we be able to
alter her personality data

154
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,541
and get rid of the virus?

155
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,625
What are you talking...

156
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,750
You don't mean...

157
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,083
You're suggesting that

158
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,208
you take the place of the
learning apparatus...?

159
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,583
No way.

160
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,291
It should be simple enough
for me to do, though...

161
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,208
I'm a master at
reflecting vectors...

162
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,541
all I'm talking about
is the next step.

163
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,833
Controlling them.

164
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,958
Fine. Let's assume
that you're somehow able

165
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,500
to get control of
Last Order's neural pathways.

166
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,666
That doesn't mean
you'll be able to

167
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,708
completely
eradicate the virus.

168
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,291
There's more than just the
Sisters at stake if you fail.

169
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,250
In this kind of attack the
casualties could be staggering.

170
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,416
The only way to avoid major
loss of life at this point

171
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,458
is to give up
on Last Order...

172
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,500
I know you don't like it,

173
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,041
but we've exhausted
all our options.

174
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,250
Hello...?
Are you listening?

175
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,041
I know I can do it...

176
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,000
Who the hell does she
think she's talking to?

177
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,458
I can collate the
pre-infection data.

178
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,125
Then all I should have to do
is erase any excess code, right?

179
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,125
Okay, this should
be simple enough.

180
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,791
Let's get started.

181
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,250
Poor kid...

182
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,041
She's already been
through hell...

183
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,583
After all the things
they've put her through...

184
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,083
saying "Sorry, we couldn't
save her" just isn't enough.

185
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,041
Collating the
pre-infection data now.

186
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,833
Object code count...

187
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,291
357,081.

188
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,791
I just need to erase all
this nasty virus code...

189
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:48,916
and that should do it...

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,208
The kid should go
back to whatever state

191
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,041
she was in a week ago...

192
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,750
before she ever
laid eyes on me.

193
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,541
Execute command...

194
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,666
Delete!

195
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:05,208
Delete! Delete!
Delete! Delete!

196
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,750
Code CIIEB.

197
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,333
Resist MA. 83256.

198
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,041
Delta 7. Code ZZ.

199
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,250
From route A to W, V7E8.

200
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:20,166
Remaining code
count: 173,542.

201
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:26,541
C.... 2 B A I 9 M C
O R E L 5 S 3 2 H A.

202
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,791
How much of her memory am I
erasing along with the virus?

203
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,250
So what if she doesn't
remember any of it?

204
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,625
The kid's better off
forgetting everything

205
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,291
that happened in
the last week, anyway.

206
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:41,000
Remaining code count: 23,891.

207
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,833
Just ten seconds
left to go...

208
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,583
I knew this would be
easy enough to do.

209
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:47,625
Get away...

210
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,000
Don't interfere.

211
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,958
You've gotta be
kidding me...

212
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,750
I'm doing electron
microscope-level precision

213
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,666
work here.

214
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,291
I don't have any power remaining
to divert to reflection.

215
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,375
I could take my
hand off the kid

216
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,208
and use vector reflection
to defend myself...

217
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,458
If I did that, he could
drop a nuclear bomb on me

218
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,500
if he wanted and I wouldn't
get so much as a scratch.

219
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,791
What an idiot...

220
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,166
Did I actually believe
this would work?

221
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,208
I thought I could do it.

222
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,708
I thought I could
save somebody else

223
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,958
and earn a second
chance for myself.

224
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,125
He's dead?

225
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,083
He's really dead!

226
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,291
I don't know how,
but he's lying there, dead,

227
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,041
and I'm still alive!

228
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,708
Error alert.
Immediate action.

229
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,500
Break code from 0000001.

230
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,958
Continuing through
code 357081.

231
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,416
Threat found
and eliminated.

232
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,333
Host command has been canceled
due to illegal process.

233
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,375
Delivery has been terminated...

234
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,125
Subject 20001 ...

235
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,250
beginning reboot process.

236
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,333
It's been canceled...?

237
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,250
The unit's restarting...?

238
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,166
No! The virus
failed to trigger?

239
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,958
What? You're alive?

240
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,416
I see...

241
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,083
That's what you did...

242
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,166
You managed to
reflect the bullet.

243
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,583
Right before it
entered your brain.

244
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,125
That's it, right?!

245
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,875
But what do you think you're
going to do now, huh...?

246
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:43,875
It's already too
late for you.

247
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,000
You're beyond saving.

248
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,125
Oh, I know that...

249
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,083
I've known it for
quite a while now...

250
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,875
Who would wanna
save me, anyway...?

251
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,666
Like anybody'd waste their
energy on scum like me...

252
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,750
The very idea is so
ridiculous it makes me laugh.

253
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:59,000
No... I'm done with
wishful thinking.

254
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,041
It makes me sick,
the person I've become...

255
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,583
but that doesn't matter.

256
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,500
It has nothing to do with
that kid, nothing whatsoever.

257
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,166
True, I'm responsible
for killing

258
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,333
more than ten thousand
of the Sisters...

259
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,833
but that doesn't mean
I'm going to sit back

260
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,041
and watch the other ten
thousand die because of you.

261
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,166
Yeah, I know...

262
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,125
Coming from me, you think
it's just lip service...

263
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,208
but I promise,
it's more than that...

264
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,500
It doesn't matter that
you and I are nothing

265
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,833
but human scum....

266
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,166
or what justifications
we might make.

267
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,708
It's not about us.
It's about her.

268
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,625
And I'm telling you,
she doesn't deserve to die!

269
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,583
His reflection's
not working...

270
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,125
He's down for
good this time.

271
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,083
That's just too bad,
now, isn't it...?

272
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,166
Looks like playing the
hero didn't work out for you.

273
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,666
Kudos for trying, but you
didn't have the strength for it.

274
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,375
Not surprising...

275
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,333
People like us weren't
built for noble deeds

276
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,000
and self-sacrifice.

277
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,041
That's just the way
it is, I'm afraid.

278
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,708
Y... Yoshikawa...

279
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,041
You shot me...

280
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,708
I'm sorry about this.

281
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,208
It's a flaw of mine...

282
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,625
I never seem to follow
through with anything.

283
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:47,833
I'm not being kind, here.

284
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,250
I'm just soft...

285
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,666
I didn't have the nerve to
hit you anywhere vital...

286
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,666
but I don't think I can
let you get away, either.

287
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,291
So I guess I've needlessly
drawn out your suffering...

288
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,166
How ironic it is
that in the end,

289
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,583
my softness has actually turned
out to be a sort of cruelty.

290
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:08,958
I don't know what happened,

291
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,333
except for what I was able
to hear over the phone.

292
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,541
But it appears that your
plan didn't work out quite

293
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,791
like you thought it would.

294
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,250
Oh him...?

295
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,166
You don't need to worry
he'll be just fine.

296
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,541
I have a rather talented
doctor friend...

297
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,333
You wouldn't guess it
by looking at him...

298
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,250
Poor man has a face
like a frog, I'm afraid.

299
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,833
But he's so good
at what he does

300
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,750
he's actually been given the
nickname Heaven Canceller.

301
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,166
With my friend
as his doctor,

302
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,833
Accelerator should
pull through.

303
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,375
How could you...?

304
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,083
It doesn't make any sense...!

305
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,458
You're a scientist.

306
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,250
You make calculations
and perform experiments

307
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,833
in a controlled
laboratory environment.

308
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,500
You don't point
guns at people!

309
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,166
See, that's the thing...

310
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,708
I sort of fell
into this position.

311
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,333
I never wanted
to be a researcher.

312
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,583
As a matter of fact, I
wanted to be a schoolteacher...

313
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,541
and not some kind
of boring lecturer...

314
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,666
but an instructor who
could really connect...

315
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,833
That's what I always
dreamed about...

316
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,958
being a good teacher.

317
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,791
One who remembered each
of her students' faces

318
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,125
from year to year...

319
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,500
One they knew
they could talk to

320
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,500
no matter what kind of
problems they were having...

321
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,708
who would smile freely,

322
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,916
without expecting
anything in return.

323
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,333
Who would hold back tears

324
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,000
when her students walked
the stage on graduation day...

325
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,208
That's the kind of
teacher I wanted to be.

326
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:29,083
At least some of that desire
still lingers with me...

327
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,750
I still wanna do
something that's good...

328
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,500
and not because
I'm soft...

329
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,208
not because I'm weak
but because it's right.

330
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,583
So now I'm acting
like a teacher

331
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,000
who would do anything
for one of her students...

332
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,375
That's why
I'm here tonight,

333
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,291
pointing a gun
at your chest.

334
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,541
Well, Amai...

335
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,125
it's over.

336
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,375
I see you're too
frightened to die alone...

337
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,750
and if you had to choose
someone to come with you,

338
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,583
I'm glad you picked me...

339
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,791
because there's no way I was
ever going to let you take

340
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,000
one of those children
with you into hell.

341
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,291
This is my one
good deed...

342
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,416
I only wish there could've
been more in my life.

343
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,041
I have to admit, you don't
seem very soft at the moment...

344
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,750
Unfortunately, teacher...

345
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,000
it won't do you any good.

346
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,791
I'm really alive...?

347
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,833
I can't believe I made it.

348
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,250
Of course you
did, my dear.

349
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,083
What would you expect
when I was operating on you?

350
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,791
I'm not questioning
your ability, doctor,

351
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,500
but I was shot point-blank
through the heart.

352
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,583
That does tend
to be fatal.

353
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,166
To be more accurate...

354
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,875
you were shot in the artery
extending from the heart.

355
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,541
But I'm splitting hairs.

356
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,708
Either way you look at it,
yes, you were basically dead.

357
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:51,875
If you're going
to thank anyone,

358
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,125
it should be that young man.

359
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,833
It looks like he
was somehow able

360
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,791
to manipulate your blood
flow to keep you alive.

361
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,500
I've seen a lot in my time,
but this was incredible...

362
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,791
He passed the blood from
one opening in your artery

363
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,333
to the other without
spilling a drop,

364
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,750
as if there was an
invisible hose.

365
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,166
He kept it up even after
he'd fallen unconscious...

366
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,166
He held until
you'd reached the OR...

367
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,708
I was able to take
over from there,

368
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,791
but without him,
you would've died.

369
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,500
Unfortunately, he isn't
out of the woods just yet.

370
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,625
He seems to have
taken a lot of damage,

371
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,291
mostly centered around
his frontal cortex...

372
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,750
His verbal and
computational abilities

373
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,166
will be affected...

374
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,416
At this point I can't say
for certain how severely.

375
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,041
His computational abilities...?
That can't be.

376
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,958
What will happen
to his esper powers?

377
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,958
Oh... I wouldn't worry
about it too much.

378
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,375
Dear, don't you know
my credo by now...?

379
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,333
When something seems unworkable,
work something out...

380
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,833
I promise I'll restore the
young man's verbal function

381
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,250
and his powers of computation...

382
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,375
no matter what.

383
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,166
You and your people seem to have
created a many-headed monster

384
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,541
and I intend to make
use of it for this...

385
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,208
They've got over ten thousand
brains linked together...

386
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,166
I think they can spare
some of that mental wealth

387
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,791
to help augment one
person's speaking

388
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,166
and calculating skills.

389
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,916
You mean The Misaka Network.

390
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,541
Last Order! Where is she?

391
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,541
Are you talking about a
young girl with brown hair,

392
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,916
by any chance?

393
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,750
Don't worry. She's safe
and under our supervision.

394
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,291
Now, enough
of my rambling.

395
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,958
My patients won't
heal themselves...

396
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,416
So what're you
going to do now?

397
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,083
What am I gonna do?

398
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,666
It looks like the
city's higher-ups

399
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,958
have found out about this
bloody little incident...

400
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,250
The lab's been
permanently shut down...

401
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,250
and the experiment
completely terminated.

402
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,416
In other words, I'm afraid
you're out of a job.

403
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,666
Oh... I see...

404
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,083
I suppose this means my
life as a researcher is over.

405
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,458
There are other
paths you can go down,

406
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,583
any number of them.

407
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,375
Wait! Please, as a friend...

408
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,583
help the young man
who came in with me.

409
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:49,750
If you don't...

410
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,916
I'll never forgive you.

411
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,250
Look who you're
talking to, my dear.

412
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,916
An injured body is a
doctor's battlefield...

413
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,416
You'll see... I'm a more
than capable soldier.

414
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,833
I always return
from battle.

415
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,291
And this time I'll bring
a patient back with me,

416
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,750
one who's been fighting
alone all these years.

417
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,750
Hah... In case you've
already forgotten,

418
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,500
I'm the one who killed ten
thousand of the Sisters...

419
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,583
and now you're asking
me to save one of them?

420
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,125
Well, what do you know...?

421
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,458
He was their
savior after all...

422
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,958
Wasn't he?

423
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:32,000
[Music]

424
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,791
The City's second term
opening ceremony

425
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,000
is rocked by the arrival
of sorcerers...

426
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,041
A mysterious
transfer student

427
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,666
further complicates
matters...

428
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,750
Clearly everything
is not what it seems.

429
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,333
Next time, "Counter Stop."

430
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:08,916
When science and
magic cross paths,

431
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,375
a story is born.
