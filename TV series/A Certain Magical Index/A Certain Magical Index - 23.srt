1
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,250
As it turns out,

2
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,750
our transfer student,
Hyoka Kazakiri, isn't human.

3
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,125
She's an anthropomorphic
manifestation

4
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,041
of AIM diffusion fields.

5
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,708
Still... what does
that matter, really?

6
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,125
Despite all that...

7
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,166
she's still our friend.

8
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,125
Now, now, monster,
there's no need for tears.

9
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,000
Crying only makes you
look more pathetic

10
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,875
and that much
easier to destroy!

11
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,125
I'm really sorry to
keep you waiting.

12
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,125
Don't worry...
Everything will be all right.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
[Music]

14
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,000
Come on, you're stronger
than that, aren't you?

15
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,958
You can't start crying
over every little thing

16
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:09,958
that goes wrong.

17
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,791
Ellis!

18
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,916
That makes your day,
doesn't it...?

19
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Somebody actually cares
about you, monster.

20
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,500
I guess there will always
be one idiot around.

21
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,916
I'm not the only one.

22
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,958
Why would you
do this for me?

23
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,541
Don't be ridiculous...

24
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,958
Why wouldn't I do it?

25
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,250
And I only had to say one
thing to these guys...

26
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,291
"My friend is in trouble.

27
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,416
I need to help her."

28
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,958
I've got something
to prove to you.

29
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,500
Whether you're human
or something else,

30
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,708
it doesn't matter.

31
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,791
You still have every
right to live your life.

32
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,708
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

33
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,208
There is a place for you.

34
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,541
And there's nobody who
can take that away.

35
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,250
You belong here, Kazakiri!

36
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,041
Ellis...! Kill them all...

37
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,416
down to the last man!

38
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,083
Configuration B...!

39
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,000
Our top priority
is civilian safety!

40
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,625
Fire now!

41
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,541
Michael...!

42
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,541
Raphael...!

43
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,958
Gabriel...!

44
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,625
Uriel!

45
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,708
Symbols of the four
quarters of Heaven!

46
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,500
I call upon your
righteous power to aid me!

47
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,375
Hear my call and
be guided by me!

48
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,750
I'm scared!

49
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,875
Well, so far everything's
going as we expected.

50
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Not that we had terribly
high expectations...

51
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,375
Hey, kid... are you
sure about this...?

52
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,666
Nobody will blame you
in the slightest

53
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,708
if you wanna to back out.

54
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:43,833
You saw it already...

55
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,541
You know what I can do.

56
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,791
I'm not backing out.

57
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,541
I'm the one who needs
to take care of this.

58
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,000
Wait, Toma...!

59
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,500
I don't understand
what's happening...

60
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,083
I'm scared... Don't go...!

61
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,416
What are you
planning to do?

62
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,875
Haven't you guessed yet?

63
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,791
I'm going to stop
that monster.

64
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,083
That's a tall order, kid...

65
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,416
Maybe Miss Tsukuyomi is lucky

66
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,791
to have you as a
student after all.

67
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,625
Prepare, men!

68
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,083
Count 5!

69
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,333
Now Count 3!

70
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,000
You can't do this...!

71
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,416
There's no way you'll
come through it alive!

72
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,291
I couldn't live with
myself if you died!

73
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,708
Toma!

74
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,041
Be careful, Kazakiri.

75
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
My right hand cancels out
any supernatural power.

76
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,666
It doesn't matter
if it's good or evil.

77
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,208
I doubt that you'd
be an exception.

78
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,000
Count 1!

79
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,416
We may not be able to
hold hands or anything...

80
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,708
but that doesn't change the fact
that we're friends, does it?

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,750
I promise you,
I'll come back alive.

82
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,958
You got that...?
I swear it.

83
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,416
You'll survive this?

84
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,666
Really?

85
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,583
Yeah...

86
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,875
We'll track down Index,

87
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,666
and the three of us will
have some fun together.

88
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,625
Count 0!

89
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:10,833
Ellis!

90
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,500
Fire!

91
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,666
Now then...

92
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
What are you playing at...?

93
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,750
You're trapped.

94
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,625
How're you going
to run away now?

95
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,166
I don't need to run away.

96
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,125
Do you hear me?
I don't need to run away!

97
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,791
I'm tired of your ranting.

98
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:00,958
Shut up!

99
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,791
Now to deal
with this thing.

100
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,541
You're gonna make
a second monster?

101
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:17,916
Unfortunately, sustaining two
at once exceeds my powers.

102
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,333
However... if I play
my hand correctly

103
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,625
there is something I can
do to get out of this mess.

104
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,958
Cease fire immediately!

105
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,750
Damn... she got away.

106
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,541
What is she up to?

107
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,416
Her target was right
in front of her,

108
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,750
and she gave
up that easily?

109
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,416
I'm overlooking
something...

110
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,583
What was it she told me?

111
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,291
That's Index's church...

112
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,000
Why would one of their members
do something like this?

113
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,500
Simple. Because I
want to start a war...

114
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,250
and this will be
what begins it.

115
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,750
So, for maximum impact,

116
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,250
I want to make
sure everyone knows

117
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,041
that I'm one of
the Church's pawns.

118
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,541
Now, what was that
brat's name, again?

119
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,875
Oh, well...

120
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,500
It's not as if she's
the only one I can kill.

121
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,000
I do have options...

122
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,750
I'll be happy to take
time out of my day

123
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,500
to kill you instead.

124
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,916
She's after Index!

125
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,375
Sure is hot out here.

126
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,541
Sure is.

127
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,875
Look at you.

128
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,791
What's with that crazy
outfit you've got on...?

129
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,791
I can't believe you're
wearing something like that

130
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,250
when it's this hot out.

131
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,625
I don't think there's anything
wrong with my clothes.

132
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,000
Thanks to some recent
modifications,

133
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,375
they're rather breezy.

134
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,958
Okay.

135
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,125
That's why...

136
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,000
It's all held together
with safety pins.

137
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,958
Impressive. How did this
get so thoroughly ripped up?

138
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,083
I find that memory
very distressing...

139
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,958
I'd appreciate it if we could
avoid the subject entirely.

140
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,875
I wonder why this
is taking so long.

141
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,125
I can't be sure,
but it sort of seemed

142
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,666
like the sorcerer was targeting
Hyoka in particular...

143
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,333
and I'm almost certain
the forms she was using

144
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,291
were of the London style...

145
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,041
I sure hope nothing bad
has happened to Hyoka.

146
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,625
The other girl who
was with you guys?

147
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,541
Is that her name, Hyoka?

148
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,791
Yeah...

149
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,291
Oh... and in this case,

150
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,458
Toma wasn't the one
who got her involved...

151
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,000
I actually introduced
him to her.

152
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,750
This time, eh?

153
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,083
How... interesting.

154
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,166
Ooh, I'm really
starting to get worried.

155
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,833
My poor friend is
trapped down there

156
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,458
with a terrorist
sorcerer on the loose,

157
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,125
and what's worse, she's
with Toma in a dimly-lit area.

158
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,166
With conditions like that,

159
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,416
any number of
things could happen,

160
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,166
Not that I'm
concerned about it,

161
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,875
but aren't you worried
about Toma's safety at all?

162
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,791
Huh...? Who, Toma...?

163
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,125
I'm not worried
about him...

164
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,791
No matter what
happens down there,

165
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,916
I know Toma will make it
back home in one piece.

166
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,958
What does she mean
"make it back home?"

167
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:31,125
Don't tell me he
and this girl are...

168
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,791
Ah...! Sphinxy,
come back here!

169
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,083
It'll be okay...

170
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,750
Although, if it's
all the same to you,

171
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,125
I think I'll just wait here.

172
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,250
You go ahead and catch
your cat and then come back.

173
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,291
Cats don't care for me.

174
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,958
I tend to rub them
the wrong way...

175
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,583
I would only make
things worse.

176
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,791
Sorry about this.

177
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,500
I'll track him down
as quickly as I can...

178
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,500
Sphinx...! Hold on!

179
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,333
Wait for Mommy!

180
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,000
Why haven't the barriers
been lifted yet?!

181
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,375
We don't control them.

182
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,333
The mall's administration
isn't our jurisdiction.

183
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,541
It's still going to take a
little while longer for us

184
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,541
to get them unlocked.

185
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,666
Damn!

186
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,041
Um... Toma...

187
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,750
I wanna thank you...

188
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,125
You know, for what
you did back there.

189
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,333
Sure thing...

190
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,416
Never mind that, though.

191
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,875
How are you
holding up so far?

192
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,750
Oh... I'm fine...

193
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,291
I think.

194
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,750
For the most part I feel
pretty normal except...

195
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,000
Is that giant
stone creature

196
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,833
going to come
after us again?

197
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,458
I don't think that sorcerer
was actually running away...

198
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,583
My guess is she escaped

199
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:54,583
so she could go
after her next target.

200
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,000
Her objective here
is not to kill

201
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,000
either one of us
specifically...

202
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,458
Someone else will do as long
as they meet certain criteria.

203
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,416
Somebody else?

204
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,041
Yeah...

205
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,708
she has options
to choose from...

206
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,958
and Index is one.

207
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,375
Oh, no...!

208
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,708
If that's the case,
shouldn't we tell these people?

209
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,375
They can do something
to protect her!

210
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,708
Index is not an
Academy City resident...

211
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,416
Antiskill can't
know about her...

212
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,875
If they find her,
she could be arrested.

213
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,166
We can only turn to
them as a last resort.

214
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,458
Anyway...

215
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,250
if I'm gonna get out,
it'll be through there...

216
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,416
Damn.

217
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,875
If they would just
lift the barriers,

218
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,708
I could easily get
a head start on her.

219
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:38,541
I hate that I'm already
so far behind her.

220
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,875
How am I gonna get down?

221
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,416
Uh... hold on.

222
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,125
Are you really going after
that woman by yourself?

223
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,666
Index is in danger.

224
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,041
No, it's okay...

225
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,208
I mean...

226
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,583
it doesn't have
to be you......

227
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,750
There's another way
we can help Index.

228
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,666
What are you
talking about?

229
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,916
To fight a monster...

230
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,708
you should send a monster,
don't you think?

231
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,791
It's not much...

232
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,125
I know it's not likely

233
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,166
that I'll be able to
defeat that giant...

234
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,000
but at the very least
I can act as a decoy.

235
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,625
If that thing
comes after me,

236
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,166
it should give Index
the chance to get away.

237
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,708
I know that's not
a lot to offer...

238
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,166
but what more can you
expect from a monster?

239
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,833
Please... are you still
going on about that?

240
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,416
Get it through your head:
you're no monster...

241
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,958
Is that how you
think I see you...?

242
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,541
As some thing to
be thrown away?!

243
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,791
It's for the best...

244
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,875
I know it is!

245
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,250
I'm okay with
being a monster...

246
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,375
It's because I'm a monster
that I didn't die,

247
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,916
even after everything that
stone creature did to me.

248
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,166
And it's because
I'm a monster

249
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,958
that I'm able to stand
up to that giant

250
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,583
and take another
beating if I have to.

251
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,291
I will do it.

252
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,875
I will protect the people
I care about, no matter what.

253
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,416
That's why I've made
peace with it all...

254
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,750
That's why I'm actually
glad to be a monster.

255
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,500
Wha...!

256
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,083
Kazakiri!!

257
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,958
I knew it...

258
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm okay.

259
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,916
This is me.

260
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,166
I'm Hyoka.

261
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,541
There's nothing of
substance here,

262
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,791
nothing solid.

263
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,166
It's all made from the
AIM diffusion fields

264
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,000
constantly emitted
by the espers.

265
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,083
An ephemeral city.

266
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,375
An unseen place that exists
in the same location...

267
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,875
as Academy City.

268
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,708
I was afraid of the
role I had to play here

269
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,500
in this illusionary town.

270
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,541
I would determine
somebody's place in life...

271
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,291
just by looking at them.

272
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,541
I would turn their
world upside down...

273
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,375
with no more than
a single thought.

274
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,458
I was the spring that
powered the mechanism.

275
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,041
My job was to breathe life

276
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,958
into the gigantic wind-up
machine that is society...

277
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,833
to make the
world go 'round.

278
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,125
I couldn't go outside.

279
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,125
I could look from the
shadow city and see things

280
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,083
and people in the
outside world,

281
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,333
but I couldn't touch
anything or talk to anyone.

282
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,541
But then...

283
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,000
something changed.

284
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,750
For the first time, I went
into the outside world.

285
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,875
Excuse me...

286
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,375
It's simple...
just push the button.

287
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,875
Today, for the first
time, I spoke...

288
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,541
For the first time,
I put on real clothes...

289
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,583
For the first time,
a boy saw me undressed.

290
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,000
For the first time,
I went to an arcade...

291
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,958
where a boy saw me
undressed again.

292
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,541
Today... for the first time...

293
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,000
I made friends.

294
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,625
When she finds out
what I truly am,

295
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,125
that I'm a monster...

296
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,666
Index may not want to
be my friend anymore.

297
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,125
But even so...

298
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,333
I'll save her.

299
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:32,875
I will!

300
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,916
There you are,
little rascal!

301
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,916
If you don't stop
being so difficult,

302
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,833
you're going to be in a
heap of trouble, young man!

303
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,250
Come on... we have to go
back to the loudmouth...

304
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,583
You behave.

305
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,208
That sounds like...

306
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,458
like footsteps?!

307
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,708
Basic theory
from Kabbalah.

308
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:42,000
Originated in the
sixteenth century...

309
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,000
Primary application is defense

310
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,458
and the elimination
of hostiles.

311
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,208
English Puritan formula
combined with the original...

312
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,750
Linguistic derivation
changed from Hebrew to English.

313
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,666
Judging by formulaic
construct...

314
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,083
remote controlled.

315
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,291
And in that case...

316
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,041
TTTR!

317
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,916
CFA.

318
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,208
PIOBTLL

319
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,041
I'm not able to use magic
to fight against it...

320
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,625
but I am able to
disrupt the spell a bit.

321
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,458
"Spell Intercept"...

322
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,166
Using imposition chants to
cut off the caster's control.

323
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:41,125
CR, BBF, TTNATWITOD

324
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,958
Manipulating him
isn't enough.

325
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,333
His self-repair operations
run in cycles...

326
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,666
I'll backtrack them.

327
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,583
Wait for an opening.

328
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,583
Right there!

329
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,583
This might work.

330
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,875
CR...

331
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,625
MBFPADCOG!

332
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,375
This isn't good...

333
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,458
He switched from
remote to self-control.

334
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,041
I can't intercept anymore!

335
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:14,958
Toma...

[Music]

337
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,666
Things are becoming more
and more complicated.

338
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,333
But no matter
what happens...

339
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,875
one thing is certain.

340
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,500
Next time "Imaginary
Number School District

341
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:06,875
Five-Element Agency."

342
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,583
When science and
magic cross paths,

343
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:09,958
a story is born.
