1
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,375
Strong crosswind...

2
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,833
Correcting sights.

3
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,791
Adjusting three
clicks left.

4
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,750
Strong gust...

5
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,958
Vortices from
three sides...

6
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,458
Now readjusting sights
one click to the right.

7
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,083
Target code...

8
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:10,958
Accelerator.

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,958
[Music]

10
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,458
Here in Academy City,

11
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,291
if they find your
coursework lacking,

12
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,458
you get to take remedial
classes during the summer.

13
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,208
Those classes are
held in late July.

14
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,958
Yet here I am
on August 20th,

15
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,166
still stuck taking
summer classes...

16
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,916
Apparently, I made the
brilliant decision

17
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
to skip the first
remedial session.

18
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,958
Unfortunately, I have
absolutely no idea

19
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,708
why I missed those classes...

20
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,750
My memory doesn't go back
any further than July 28th.

21
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,041
So now I'm stuck paying
tuition for courses

22
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,833
I don't even remember
skipping in the first place...

23
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,041
What else could go wrong?

24
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't have any change.

25
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,291
My rotten luck.

26
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,750
Are you done?

27
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,125
You just gonna stand
there like an idiot?

28
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,041
If you're not buying
anything, move it.

29
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,666
That's a Tokiwadai
Middle School uniform...

30
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,250
Who is this girl?

31
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,166
Geez... you're
one rude chick.

32
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:27,500
Chick...? I have... a name!

33
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,875
When will you get it
through your thick skull?!

34
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,916
My name is Mikoto Misaka!

35
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,333
I guess I know her.

36
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,125
You're wasting
your time...

37
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,041
That vending machine is
just gonna eat your money.

38
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,291
Yeah, I know that.

39
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,708
There's a trick to it...

40
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,916
I can get a drink
out of this thing

41
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,041
without spending
any money at all.

42
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,000
What kind of trick?

43
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,166
Nice shorts.

44
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,625
This is an old machine.

45
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,833
The springs that hold the
drinks in place are loose,

46
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:06,875
so you just have
to jiggle them...

47
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,041
The only catch is

48
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,000
you can't choose
what you get this way.

49
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,583
Hey what are
you staring at?

50
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,500
Are all the girls
who go to Tokiwadai

51
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,041
as violent as you are?

52
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,041
Life's tough at an
all-girls school

53
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,333
despite whatever
daydreams you might have.

54
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,291
You know, the machine's probably
broken in the first place

55
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,166
because people like you
kick it all the time.

56
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,083
What is with you...?

57
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,291
It's not like I'm
doing anything to you.

58
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,500
Oh, I see.

59
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,500
So how much cash did the
machine take you for?

60
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,916
Two thousand.

61
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,291
Seriously?! You put that
big a bill into this old thing?

62
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,666
It's not like
I had a choice!

63
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,916
No wonder the
machine kept it!

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What an idiot!

65
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,750
Why not just
burn your money?

66
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,541
I can get it back for you.

67
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,500
Oh yeah? How?

68
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,625
Easy. Like this.

69
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,583
Whoa... That's
a lotta drinks.

70
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,041
You didn't get
your cash back,

71
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,750
but I bet even more
drinks'll come out of here

72
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,250
than you paid for
with that bill...

73
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,250
That okay with you?

74
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,583
Why are you running like
a scared little girl?!

75
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,666
Hey!

76
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,875
Here, catch.

77
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,000
You need to pull
your weight...

78
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,541
I think you should start by
carrying some of these drinks...

79
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,583
This is your portion
of the total haul.

80
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,166
You realize by
accepting these,

81
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,708
I'm graduating from innocent
bystander to accomplice.

82
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,333
That's not a role I
want to take on...

83
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,875
Ow!

84
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,000
Hey... if you don't
want this one,

85
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,458
I'll take it
off your hands.

86
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,416
There's something I still
don't get about you...

87
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,750
You've got power but no
confidence to back it up,

88
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,041
so you end up
walking around

89
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,875
looking like a
complete idiot...

90
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,208
You bested Mikoto Misaka.

91
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,041
That's not something a
lotta people can say.

92
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,375
At the very least, I would
hope you'd accept your victory

93
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,458
with some kind of
grace and dignity.

94
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,708
Bested? I beat her
at something...?

95
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,250
Sports, maybe...?

96
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,208
It would be a lot easier
to be a gracious victor

97
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,125
if I knew what the heck
she was talking about...

98
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,958
but this lecture doesn't
make any sense to me...!

99
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,416
Please, let her
stop talking!

100
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,625
Are you having some kind
of mental breakdown?

101
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,375
Come on... Just relax
and drink your soda...

102
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,666
You're lucky to be getting a
present from Master Mikoto...

103
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,333
plenty of girls would kill
to be in your position.

104
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,916
Oh really, would they...?

105
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,666
Are you some
kind of celebrity?

106
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,208
It's not something I chose,

107
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,041
but yeah, I am a celebrity.

108
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,291
I'm surprised
you don't already know

109
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,208
what they call me at
Tokiwadai Middle School.

110
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,750
Is that you Sissy?

111
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,583
Oh, it is you...!

112
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,041
I thought I was seeing
things for a second...!

113
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,333
It didn't make sense for you
to be in a remedial class,

114
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,291
but it was all just a
pretense for this, huh?

115
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,041
What...? I don't know what
you're talking about...

116
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,041
A pretense for
what, exactly?

117
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,875
Don't be coy, Sissy...

118
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:13,291
I'm talking about this
secret assignation.

119
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,875
Pleased to meet you...

120
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,583
The name's Shirai Kuroko,

121
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,958
and I have the honor of being
Mikoto's right hand gal.

122
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,458
I don't know if
you were planning

123
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,875
to put the moves on her...

124
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,083
but if that is
the intention,

125
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,833
you'll have to clear
it with me first.

126
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,791
Please...!

127
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,125
Are you kidding me?!

128
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,541
Do you really think this
moron is my boyfriend?!

129
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,333
No, of course not!

130
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,083
I know you'd have better
taste than that...

131
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,125
I'm going...
I'm sure I can trust you

132
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,041
not to embarrass
yourself here, Sissy...

133
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,625
Isn't that right?

134
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,875
Kuroko!

135
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,833
If you start spreading
rumors, you will pay!

136
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,291
Teleportation...

137
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,541
Hello, sister.

138
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,916
Another one?!

139
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,416
I'm confused.

140
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,458
She has a twin?

141
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,750
"Not exactly...

142
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,708
I'm her younger sister,"
Misaka quickly replies.

143
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,583
Okay, you're her sister...

144
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,041
but why are you
talking about yourself

145
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,708
in the third person
like that...?

146
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,583
You both have the
same last name.

147
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,875
Doesn't it get kind of
confusing around the house?

148
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,708
"Misaka's name is Misaka,"

149
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,583
Misaka replies in
some confusion.

150
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,166
More importantly... what are you
doing here in the first place?

151
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,083
"You want to
know the reason

152
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,333
for my presence here at
this point in time...

153
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,666
I am in training,"
Misaka answers.

154
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,125
Oh... training...

155
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,875
Hey, little sister...

156
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,708
could I talk to you
for a second...?

157
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,583
We've got some
catching up to do.

158
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,000
Quite a bit.

159
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,458
"Unfortunately, Misaka
has a schedule to keep,

160
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,375
so she cannot
take the time...

161
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,916
It's okay!

162
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,791
Come with me.

163
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,875
Well, we have to
get going now...

164
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,458
You probably should, too.

165
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,000
You don't want
to miss curfew.

166
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,750
That was weird...

167
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,208
What an interesting family.

168
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,875
Hot day...

169
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,458
Cold drinks...

170
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,541
So heavy...

171
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,833
Least I didn't trip.

172
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,541
Whoa!

173
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,541
That's not fair...!

174
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,916
No!

175
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,208
Damn it...! What'd I
do to deserve this?

176
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,375
You're back.

177
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,541
I thought you
and your sister

178
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,166
were going off
somewhere to talk.

179
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,083
Hold on.

180
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,500
I could've sworn she was
wearing shorts earlier.

181
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,458
"You've fallen.
Do you need help getting up?"

182
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,416
Misaka is forced to ask,
somewhat reluctantly.

183
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,208
Oh...

184
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,583
You aren't her.
You're the kid sister...

185
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,583
You know... you sure
look a lot like Mikoto.

186
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,000
"Who's 'Mikoto'"...

187
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,125
Misaka inquires with
polite curiosity...

188
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,500
Ah, yes...
You're speaking of my sister.

189
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,708
So, why're you carrying
around those military goggles?

190
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,166
"Unlike her sister,
Misaka lacks the ability

191
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,250
to follow electron beams
and magnetic field lines

192
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,666
by eyesight...

193
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,250
She requires a device like
this to make them visible.

194
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:37,041
"Misaka patiently explains
to the ignorant young boy.

195
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,666
Okay...

196
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,500
So, why are you here...?

197
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,541
I thought you and your
sister were off bonding.

198
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,208
"Misaka was there before,
and now she is here."...

199
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,458
Misaka says.

200
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,750
"Where should we take
these beverages?"

201
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,583
Misaka enquires, politely
picking up one of the cans

202
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,041
that are strewn about.

203
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,375
Oh, no... It's okay.

204
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,125
I can handle
this by myself.

205
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,041
"These beverages
do not belong here.

206
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,416
Where should
we take them?"

207
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,375
Misaka repeats.

208
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:16,125
Huh...? No... honestly,
it'll be okay...

209
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,833
You're not obligated
to help me.

210
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,166
We should act swiftly.

211
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,208
Okay.

212
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:33,958
Hey...! Mister Toma Kamijo!

213
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,083
My air conditioner's
busted...!

214
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,291
I'm staying here with
my brother for the night.

215
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,166
It's like an old-fashioned
slumber party!

216
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,166
Oh that's cool...

217
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,541
Is he home?

218
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,375
Nope... No idea where he is.

219
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,583
This is Maika...

220
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,333
My classmate Tsuchimikado
is her stepbrother...

221
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,583
Apparently... she's in
training to become a maid.

222
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,458
Maid school must
be rough, huh...

223
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,875
You don't get
summers off, right?

224
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,708
According to
our school motto

225
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:04,041
a successful maid doesn't need
to take time off for herself...

226
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,166
You have a lot of
drinks there...

227
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,958
Where'd you get so
many cans of soda...?

228
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,750
Did you rob a
vending machine?

229
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,208
I paid for them all...

230
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,166
and because you
asked so politely...

231
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,416
would you like
to have one?

232
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,333
Well... since you offered...

233
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,333
One more thing...
you have to be more careful

234
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,875
hiding girls in your place...

235
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,541
If I were you,
I would make sure

236
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,833
the refrigerator is
always kept well-stocked,

237
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,791
because an appetite
like that little one has

238
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,833
is pretty memorable.

239
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,333
How did you
know about that?

240
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,250
Let's just say that I
never would've guessed

241
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,958
that a nun could
be so noisy.

242
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,625
"Is that the type of thing
you're interested in?"

243
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:47,375
Misaka asks with a note
of disdain in her voice.

244
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,166
You have no idea.

245
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,458
What are they up to now?

246
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,041
Hey... what's going on...?

247
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,458
What're you doing here?

248
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,208
Are you locked out of the
apartment or something?

249
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,000
Huh...? Oh, it's Toma!

250
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,041
No, we're not
locked out...

251
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,166
Wait a second!

252
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,666
Why did you bring a
strange girl home?

253
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,291
The welcome wagon.

254
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,708
It seems you're a person
who requires many options...

255
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,000
If no one woman is
enough to satisfy you,

256
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,458
perhaps you should
look somewhere else.

257
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,083
Seriously, just tell me...

258
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,000
What are you two doing?

259
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,916
Poor Sphinx is
covered in fleas.

260
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,416
We're just trying
to get rid of them.

261
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,166
So is my place crawling
with fleas now, too...?

262
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,708
Damn it! I knew I'd been
feeling itchy lately.

263
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,458
We've got it
under control...

264
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,958
Calm down.

265
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,000
What is that...?
Some kind of fern?

266
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,666
It's an herb called sage.

267
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,833
It's medicinal...

268
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,291
I'm going to burn it,

269
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,916
and the smoke it produces
will make the fleas go away

270
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,500
and leave Sphinx alone.

271
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,333
Medicinal... sure...

272
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,083
Sounds more like a recipe
for stewed cat to me...

273
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,250
What's that, Himegami...?

274
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,708
Does that go in the stew?

275
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,291
Or what?

276
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,458
This is a magic spray
for removing fleas.

277
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,000
A magic spray...? Really?

278
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,833
You simply aim the
spray at the fleas

279
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,041
and it eradicates them.

280
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,541
You're more likely
to eradicate the cat!

281
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,583
That's a can of
high-strength pesticide!

282
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,041
"What exactly are you
trying to accomplish here?"

283
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,083
"You simply wish
to remove the fleas

284
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,916
without using a toxic
substance, is that correct?"

285
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,916
Misaka asks for confirmation.

286
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,666
I think that
about covers it...

287
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,208
Do you have a plan?

288
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,500
"Yes, I do...

289
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,166
Watch this,"
Misaka instructs.

290
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,708
"I used a specific frequency
to exterminate only the fleas,"

291
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,958
Misaka reports helpfully.

292
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,916
"I believe you can use a normal
insecticide to kill the fleas

293
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,458
that may have infested
your place of residence.

294
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,416
"Though Misaka does suggest
you use it carefully.

295
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Oh... Yeah.

296
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,666
All right, then.

297
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,416
My errand is now complete.

298
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,875
The standard cards
used to test for ESP

299
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,416
were changed after
an experiment done

300
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,750
in the United States in 1992.

301
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,000
Because of the material
from which they were made,

302
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,083
the cards were
easily distinguished

303
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,666
by the fingerprints
left upon them

304
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,125
by the test administrators...

305
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,375
In order to assure the
integrity of the experiment

306
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,666
the cards were...

307
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,541
Hey...! Toma Kamijo...!

308
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,125
Are you paying
attention to me?

309
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,708
Yeah, I'm listening...

310
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,000
but is hearing
all this history

311
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,291
going to increase
my power at all?

312
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,375
Really... He's
still a Level Zero.

313
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,583
You can't make something
out of nothing, can you?

314
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:37,875
Be quiet...!

315
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,833
Everything in this world
starts out as nothing.

316
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:40,625
But without
time and effort,

317
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,625
it will remain that way.

318
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,583
Miss Misaka of Tokiwadai
Middle School is ranked third

319
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,458
out of all
Academy City espers...

320
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,791
She began as Level 1

321
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,333
and through tireless
work and dedication

322
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,083
she was able to advance
all the way to Level 5.

323
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,625
She's ranked third...?

324
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,208
That girl?!

325
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,583
What, Kamijo...?

326
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,250
Are you and Miss Misaka
acquaintances?

327
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,208
No... Well, not really.

328
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,125
Oh, hey!

329
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,083
You finishing
remedial lessons also?

330
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,666
Oh... it's you again.

331
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,041
Stupid things...

332
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,000
I really can't
stand those blimps.

333
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,208
Yeah? Why's that?

334
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,250
Because they're nothing
but big computers.

335
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,500
Programmed by the
machine to control us.

336
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,875
The machine...?

337
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,833
Wait... that does
sound familiar...

338
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,541
Gimme a second...

339
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,666
I remember!
Tree Diagram, was it?

340
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,625
Yep, that's what
they called it...

341
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,208
The most powerful
supercomputer ever to exist,

342
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,958
loaded aboard the
great satellite Orihime-1,

343
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,625
which was launched
by Academy City

344
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,208
in order to analyze data
regarding the world's climate.

345
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,750
Well, that's what
they tell us...

346
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,458
but what d'you suppose
the chances are

347
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,458
that such a thing
actually exists?

348
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,875
Huh?

349
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,875
Ow...! Geez...! What
the hell was that for?!

350
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,000
Eh... forget it.

351
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,625
I was just rambling.

352
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,250
Wha...?

353
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,833
Well... I'm headed
this way, so...

354
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,291
That's Mikoto... isn't it?

355
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,375
It's the younger sister...

356
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,958
Man... if you
lose the goggles,

357
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,541
there's no way to
tell 'em apart.

358
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,708
Hi again...

359
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,166
Thanks for helping with the
drinks and the fleas yesterday.

360
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,958
"I do not require any
words of gratitude,"

361
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,750
Misaka informs the boy.

362
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,958
What's up...?
Is that for him?

363
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,791
"Misaka would like
to feed the cat,

364
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,166
but unfortunately,
she cannot do so,"

365
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,000
Misaka concludes sadly.

366
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,416
"She has a critical defect...

367
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,416
one that prevents her
from feeding animals,"

368
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,208
Misaka further explains.

369
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,666
What defect?

370
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,625
"Misaka's body constantly
emits a weak magnetic field,"

371
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,083
Misaka explains.

372
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,708
"It's not strong enough
for people to detect...

373
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,750
but it is a different
matter for animals."

374
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,791
"Unless something
else is done,

375
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,458
the cat will be
taken to the pound,"

376
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,541
Misaka has
unfortunately observed.

377
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,791
Well, yeah...

378
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,791
I guess that's true...

379
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,458
"That is not a kind fate.

380
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,375
Do you know how animals are
treated in such facilities?"

381
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,041
Misaka pointedly enquires.

382
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,750
You're the one
who found him.

383
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,083
So shouldn't you be the one
who gets to give him a name?

384
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,875
-It's "Dog."
-Huh?

385
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,666
"The black cat will
be named Dog,"

386
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,833
Misaka unequivocally declares...

387
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,708
He is a cat... named dog.

388
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,708
Yeah, I get it...

389
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,291
but I dunno...

390
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,083
maybe he should have
a more dignified name?

391
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,583
"Perhaps we should call
him Nelson Mandela,"

392
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,583
Misaka suggests.

393
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,541
That's overdoing it!

394
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,875
How about Schrödinger?

395
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,458
No... You cannot
name a cat Schrodinger.

396
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,541
I'll just be a second.

397
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,916
You can wait
out here, right?

398
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,541
"I believe I understand.

399
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,125
Are you looking for a book
on how to care for cats?"

400
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,791
Misaka asks him,
seeking confirmation.

401
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,500
It's pretty clear I have a lot
to learn in that department.

402
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,041
You remember the flea
situation yesterday, right?

403
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,625
"That was indeed a
regrettable scene...

404
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,333
I'm impelled to tell you,
the improper treatment of cats

405
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,833
is a blatant violation of
animal protection laws,"

406
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,208
Misaka warns
him very sternly.

407
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,208
Hey... come on...
that wasn't me.

408
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,291
"You are just
splitting hairs...

409
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,333
Though you may not have
been directly involved,

410
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,875
the incident did occur at
your place of residence,"

411
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,458
Misaka replies, her
patience now wearing thin.

412
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,500
Sorry.

413
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,166
I'm guessing they're not
going to appreciate it

414
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,416
if I come into the
store carrying a cat.

415
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,458
"I have previously informed
you of my limitations...

416
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,583
I cannot safely
interact with the cat,"

417
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,916
Misaka says for...

418
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,208
You said cats
don't like you

419
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,958
'cause of the magnetic
field, right...?

420
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,000
Well maybe the two of
you can change that...

421
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,083
Could be the start of
a beautiful friendship!

422
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,208
"Honestly...
That is unacceptable.

423
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,750
What kind of person would

424
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,708
so thoughtlessly throw
a kitten around?"

425
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,916
Misaka asks incredulously.

426
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,458
We are all dying
to find out.

427
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,791
Who is the strongest Level
5 esper in Academy City?

428
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,333
We should know soon... huh?

429
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:32,166
[Music]

430
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,333
Apparently in
Academy City,

431
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,916
they butcher innocents and
call it experimentation...

432
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,958
Hey, Misaka, how much
do you know about this?

433
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,750
Next time, "Sisters."

434
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,500
When science and
magic cross paths,

435
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,375
a story is born.
