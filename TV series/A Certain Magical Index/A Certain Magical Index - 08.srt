1
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,416
While out to lunch I met

2
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,833
a strange
priestess-slash-magician.. .

3
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,458
Later I learned that
this young girl

4
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:40,291
was being held captive
within Misawa Prep School...

5
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,166
The sorcerer Stiyl
basically ordered me

6
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,041
to come with him to
retrieve her...

7
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,083
Everything seemed normal
inside the school, until...

8
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,416
That's no robot...
It's a corpse.

9
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:58,875
[Music]

10
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:05,083
Ars Magna
(Golden Transmutation)"

11
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,291
A corpse?

12
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,458
Probably one of the Knights of
the Roman Catholic Church...

13
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,291
Judging by this, I'd say
they've been wiped out.

14
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,708
Why'd he die?

15
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,416
This school is
a battlefield...

16
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,833
and dying's pretty much what
happens on a battlefield.

17
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,333
It's not surprising.

18
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,083
Why is everyone here acting
like it didn't even happen?

19
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,666
Megumi! Wait for me.

20
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,125
She just walked
right through it.

21
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,666
There are two sides:
heads and tails...

22
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,208
Like a coin.

23
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,583
We're in the same
place as they are,

24
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,708
but there's a
barrier between us.

25
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,583
The students are on
the heads side,

26
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,125
and they can't see people
on the tails side, like us.

27
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,333
And while we can see them,

28
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,250
we can't interfere
with them in any way.

29
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,250
Don't bother.

30
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,750
The only way to bring
the barrier down

31
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,041
is to eliminate the core of
the sorcery that made it...

32
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,625
I'll bet the core
itself is located

33
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,375
somewhere outside
the barrier.

34
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,166
This death gives us
another reason to fight.

35
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,500
Why can't we take
the elevator

36
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,125
instead of hauling ourselves
up all these stairs?

37
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,041
We're on the tails side,
remember...?

38
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,375
And the button to
call the elevator

39
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,125
is over on the heads side.

40
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,416
I wonder how cell
phone calls work then.

41
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,791
Huh?

42
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,375
Nothing, really...

43
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,125
I was just curious whether or
not a call made from this side

44
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,541
would make it through
to the other side.

45
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,541
Well then, why don't
you give it a try?

46
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,791
I think I will.

47
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,375
Ah...! This is, um,
Index Libror--uh...

48
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,041
I mean, you've reached
the Kamijo residence... so...

49
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,208
hello.

50
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,875
Wow, awesome greeting...

51
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,208
Have you used a
phone before...

52
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,833
or just this once?

53
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,500
Hey... hold on...

54
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,208
that sounds like
Toma's voice.

55
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,916
What is it...? What
could be so important

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,625
that you would use
a cellular phone?

57
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,916
A device known to cause
brain tumors, depression,

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,458
and decreased
mental function.

59
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,416
Um... it's nothing major.

60
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,208
Oh, by the way, there were
two servings of lasagna

61
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,250
in the refrigerator.
Did one belong to you?

62
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,125
Why, did you eat
both of them? !

63
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,000
Uh... there was some
pudding sitting in there

64
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,708
with the lasagna, too.

65
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,000
Was...? Don't tell me.

66
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,625
You ate all that,
too, didn't you...?!

67
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,750
Admit it!

68
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,000
Eh, it's okay.

69
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,708
Anyway, I was just
checking cell reception...

70
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,541
I gotta go.

71
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,791
Oh, one more thing...

72
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,041
They say every minute
you spend on the phone

73
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,875
decreases your
life expectancy.

74
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,083
What...? Is there
something wrong?

75
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,666
Oh, no...

76
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,291
I was just thinking that
you seem to be awfully relaxed.

77
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,500
I mean, here we are
in enemy territory...

78
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,875
and almost the
first thing you do

79
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,666
is start chatting up a girl.

80
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,958
I don't really care
if that ego of yours

81
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,666
ends up being
the death of you.

82
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,458
You can get yourself
killed, for all I care.

83
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,166
But...

84
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,541
I don't want you dragging
me down with you, got it?

85
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,583
Jealous, are we?

86
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,625
Don't be ridiculous...

87
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,458
I have already explained
to you the nature

88
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,750
of my relationship
with Index...

89
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,750
I'd think you of all
people would understand.

90
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,500
Just think about it.

91
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,375
She's lived for years
in a body that would be

92
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,750
destroyed without
regular memory erasure.

93
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,750
There have been a number
of people in her life

94
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,833
who were in the same
place as you...

95
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,708
Over the years, these
people have tried to play

96
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,416
various roles for her...

97
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,083
Father, brother,

98
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:58,166
friend, teacher.

99
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,166
I tried once and failed...

100
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,208
Then you tried and
ended up saving her.

101
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,416
That's all.

102
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,458
That's the only difference
there is between you and me.

103
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,666
He's wrong...

104
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,666
I'm not the one who
saved Index anymore.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,083
I'm not the
person she wants.

106
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,333
He disappeared
when I lost my memory.

107
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,000
Isn't that dress
just the worst?

108
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,791
Yeah, it totally is.

109
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,666
This is my first time
seeing a scientific cult,

110
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,083
but it seems
pretty normal, huh?

111
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,250
Wanna stop by
on the way home?

112
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,083
I was expecting to see
life-size pictures

113
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,750
of the founder on display.

114
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,333
Doesn't give off a
battlefield vibe to me.

115
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,458
Well, that's a bit odd.

116
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,291
There's nothing
to worry about...

117
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,083
Remember, we're on
different sides of the coin.

118
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,458
There's no way
they can see us.

119
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,541
The seraph's wings shine
with a brilliant light.

120
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,208
In the whiteness
of the radiant light,

121
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,333
all guilt will be exposed.

122
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,708
The whiteness is a
symbol of purity.

123
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,208
Purification
requires action.

124
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,125
Action is the present
and the future.

125
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,375
The future is time.

126
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,208
We seem to have
tripped an alarm.

127
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,416
What?

128
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,083
They should be prevented
from even seeing us

129
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,458
because of the barrier.

130
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,208
But something's alerted
them to our presence.

131
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,125
Guilt is the
province of humanity.

132
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,750
Humans fear guilt, though to
experience such fear is a sin.

133
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,333
Sin is a virus that
destroys the self.

134
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,958
You may try to
hide your sin,

135
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,583
but if anything
vile lies within you,

136
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,333
the light of
the seraph's wings

137
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,375
will expose it for all
around you to see...

138
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,083
It will be expelled
from within.

139
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,208
Okay, Imagine Breaker.

140
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,750
Looks like you're up!

141
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,583
Hey wait!

142
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,875
Great.

143
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,250
Why are you running?

144
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,583
Your right hand was strong
enough to protect

145
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:11,833
you from Dragon's Breath,

146
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,583
but instead of using
it to defend yourself,

147
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,458
you're showing
them your back.

148
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,583
You don't really have
room to talk here...

149
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,833
Anyway, did you see how
many of them there are?

150
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,416
I can't fight all of
them with one hand.

151
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,291
Yeah, fine.

152
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,250
But with a Gregorian
Choir after us,

153
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,958
we need to figure
something out quickly.

154
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,708
It would help if I knew
what this choir thingy was.

155
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,208
I'll summarize.

156
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,666
Essentially, it's a big
spell formed by the voices

157
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,500
of three-thousand-three-
hundred-and-thirty-three monks

158
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,875
in a holy shrine.

159
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,416
Can a bunch of people
chanting nonsense

160
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,041
do anything
that would hurt us?

161
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,458
It sure can, but
it doesn't work

162
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,458
unless every person in
the Choir is speaking

163
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,083
the exact same words
at the exact same time.

164
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,208
We have to find
whatever it is

165
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,000
that keeps them
all synchronized.

166
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,083
I do have one
thing up my sleeve

167
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,000
for a situation
such as this.

168
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,625
Great, then
use it already!

169
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,958
All right.

170
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,166
What was that for? !

171
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,125
Sorry, you drew
the short straw.

172
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,458
Flames will punish
those who are guilty...

173
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,625
Purgatory is the realm
of the purifying flame.

174
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,291
Purgatory was created to
burn sin from the sinner.

175
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,958
Only a purified
soul may pass

176
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,458
through the gates of heaven.

177
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,791
Pain is necessary
for purification......

178
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,791
Pain is an affirmation.

179
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,291
Stop talking!

180
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,666
Can't you see
what's happening to you?

181
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,250
You've got cuts
all over your body!

182
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,041
The inner peace of the
self joins the external

183
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,583
world in a harmonious--

184
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,291
What's going on?

185
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,958
What in the world
just happened?

186
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,166
I have to hand it to him.

187
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,166
The alchemist is one
twisted individual...

188
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,041
Instead of doing the
dirty work himself,

189
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,125
he lets these students
bloody their hands.

190
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,666
Naturally...

191
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,208
I knew that by using a replica
of the Gregorian Choir,

192
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,916
I could lure
you to the core

193
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,416
from wherever you
had been hiding.

194
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,708
Obviously, I expected
someone else to be with you...

195
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,291
Oh well, I
suppose the Choir

196
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,625
must have swallowed up
your plucky sidekick...

197
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,875
Unfortunately for you,

198
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,583
he's tougher than you
give him credit for.

199
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,166
Now then... the great
Aureolus Izzard

200
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,500
has lured me
into his lair.

201
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,708
Why am I here, alchemist...?

202
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,375
What do you want from me?

203
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,125
A little first aid
and she'll be fine.

204
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,291
Really?

205
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,541
Because only the
capillaries were severed

206
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,083
the damage is not as
extensive as it might appear.

207
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,041
It would be far
worse than this

208
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,083
if her arteries
had been cut.

209
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,416
How do you know? It's not
like you're a doctor.

210
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,791
I know more than
most when it comes

211
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,750
to the circulatory system.

212
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,083
You'll need to help me.

213
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,000
-Not cool!
-Collect yourself.

214
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,583
It is just a
medical procedure.

215
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,833
So, what do you think,
Sphinx...?

216
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,083
Where did our Toma
run off to today?

217
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,541
There was some pudding
sitting in there

218
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,875
with the lasagna, too.

219
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,416
Was...? Don't tell me.

220
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,416
You ate all that, too,
didn't you...?! Admit it!

221
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,958
Eh, it's okay.

222
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,250
Something's wrong...

223
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,458
Toma reacted way
too calmly...

224
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,041
He would never be that okay
with me eating his pudding.

225
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,375
Why are these runes here?

226
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,125
We're all done
for now at least.

227
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,125
You did a pretty
incredible job with her.

228
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,041
Are you sure that
you haven't had

229
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,708
any medical
training before?

230
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,625
It's not about training.

231
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,541
Huh? ... Then how did you...?

232
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,750
I told you before,
I'm a magician.

233
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,208
Yeah, I know...

234
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,708
but I haven't seen
you do any magic.

235
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,208
Then let me show
you something.

236
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,583
Here.

237
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,916
See this? It's
my magic wand.

238
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,250
Uh... that's a
police baton!

239
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,166
-The latest model.
-Put it away!

240
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,500
Stop kidding around...

241
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,791
We need to call an
ambulance for her.

242
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,375
You should do that.

243
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,208
It's more complicated
than that...

244
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,833
You need to get
out of here, too.

245
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,375
Aren't you tired of being
cooped up in this place...?

246
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,250
Let's go get
some fresh air.

247
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,875
Actually, I have a
plan of my own...

248
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,333
and it doesn't involve getting
out of this building...

249
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,000
What I need to do requires
me to stay here...

250
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,541
or, rather...

251
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,875
It requires me to stay
with the alchemist,

252
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,375
and for now, that means
being in this school.

253
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,500
Really...? But isn't this
place the headquarters

254
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,041
for some crazy cult?

255
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,208
That was before Aureolus
took things over here.

256
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,416
I'm not a prisoner.
I stay inside

257
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,958
because I do not wish
to venture out....

258
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,333
When I go out
into the world,

259
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,083
I run the risk
of attracting them.

260
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,833
So you're telling me
you're gonna stay hidden

261
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,416
in here forever because
you don't want

262
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,875
the vampires to detect you?

263
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,416
That doesn't sound
like much of a life.

264
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,833
Tell me something...

265
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,500
Do you know what
vampires are like?

266
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,500
They're no different.

267
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,875
Vampires are no different
from normal people.

268
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,416
They laugh, they
sing, they love...

269
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,958
They make sacrifices
for the good of others.

270
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,791
My blood is unusual...

271
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:41,041
It has a sweet aroma
that attracts vampires...

272
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,000
It rounds them up,
draws them in...

273
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,291
and kills them.

274
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,958
It's the same every time.

275
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,708
It kills every one... always...

276
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,166
without exception.

277
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,750
Academy City is a hub of
supernatural activity...

278
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,166
I thought I could
find someone here

279
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,041
to understand my power...

280
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,708
and then, once it
was understood,

281
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,208
I hoped it could
be taken from me.

282
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,708
But in the end, the solution
that I sought wasn't here.

283
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,208
I don't want to cause
any more death...

284
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,625
If it comes down to it...

285
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,083
I've decided I
will kill myself

286
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,166
before taking another life.

287
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,500
That so...? Then
explain something...

288
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,916
If you're so worried about
the effects of your power...

289
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,333
then why did you go
out to eat earlier?

290
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,833
Simple...

291
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,333
The reason
Aureolus needs me

292
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,250
is because he wants
to attract vampires.

293
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,875
And if I remain inside
the barrier he created,

294
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,458
I cannot draw them out
as he wishes me to.

295
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,208
Okay... but doesn't
doing that for him

296
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,708
go completely against
your objective in all this?

297
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,416
Aureolus made a
promise to me...

298
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,166
He said he wouldn't harm
any vampires that came for me.

299
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,083
He said that he
didn't need to...

300
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,291
He just needed the
vampires' power...

301
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,708
because there was somebody
who he needed to help.

302
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,291
That's why I'm
working with him.

303
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,875
Instead of killing...

304
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,875
my power is helping...

305
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,208
That's the way
I want it to be.

306
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,416
It's never going to work.

307
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,250
Even if he is the kind of
person you say he is...

308
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,916
this is a mistake
that's gone way too far.

309
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,666
If things continue
like this...

310
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,625
before much longer, there
will be no turning back.

311
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,791
Perhaps... but why would
I wish to turn back

312
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,500
from the path I have chosen?

313
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,125
Has he been listening?

314
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,416
I've been here longer
than you think...

315
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,125
and I'm nearer
than you imagine.

316
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,250
Naturally, in
their ignorance,

317
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,916
some lesser minds will doubt
the plans I've made.

318
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,416
Damn you!

319
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,500
You will come no closer,

320
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,000
and your fist will hit
nothing but air.

321
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,083
Oh, yeah? !

322
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,041
What happened...?..
How did you do that?

323
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:50,166
Now... I find your
company lacking...

324
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,916
-Time to go!
-No!

325
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,666
Are you crazy? !

326
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,041
If she has enough power
to kill vampires...

327
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,791
what else can she do?

328
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,375
When push comes to shove,

329
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,208
you still rely on the
power of your Deep Blood

330
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,041
which implies you do not
wish to give it up.

331
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,666
If you cling to it, how are
you any different from me?

332
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,958
I'm not a killer.

333
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,916
This boy didn't even know
what Deep Blood meant;

334
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,291
he isn't here
because of that.

335
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,083
He only came today
to rescue a stranger

336
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,708
he met over lunch...

337
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,500
Tell me, Aureolus...

338
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,041
what is your true goal?

339
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,041
Do you intend to take an
innocent person's life

340
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,666
because he
inconvenienced you?

341
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,916
If you're the type of man who
would do something like that,

342
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,833
then our arrangement
will end here and now.

343
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,583
I have already made
it clear to you

344
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,833
that I am not afraid
to die if necessary.

345
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,416
Very well...

346
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,166
I cannot afford to waste
more of my time anyway.

347
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,583
Don't be afraid. I have no
intention of killing you.

348
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,916
You will forget everything
that has transpired here.

349
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,083
This is it.

350
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,041
The trail of magical power
leading from the runes

351
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,750
ends abruptly right here.

352
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,916
Where am I?

353
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,291
Judging by the fact
that you're still here,

354
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm gonna guess
that we're in Japan.

355
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,291
I have the
disturbing feeling

356
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,416
that I've forgotten
something important...

357
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,083
Know what I mean?

358
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,208
Well... if it really
is important,

359
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,208
I'm sure we'll remember
it eventually.

360
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,041
Do you really think so?

361
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,833
You will forget
everything.

362
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,875
I wanna show
you something.

363
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,125
It's a little trick I know
that will make you

364
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,083
feel better in no time.

365
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,916
Home remedies are
Kanzaki's specialty.

366
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,166
I think I'll just ask
her about it later on.

367
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,458
Just close your eyes...

368
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,250
and then stick
out your tongue.

369
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,875
What?

370
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,333
See?

371
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,208
This is for using
me as a decoy

372
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,208
so your cowardly
butt could run away!

373
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,458
There's a barrier in place
here to keep intruders

374
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,083
from getting away
after they've entered.

375
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,500
Hmm... hello.

376
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,916
Who's there?

377
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,083
You don't remember...?

378
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,708
No, I don't
suppose you would

379
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,625
have any memory of the
name Aureolus Izzard.

380
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,041
Well... that is
for the best.

381
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,625
I consider it
good fortune.

382
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,041
Now, sleep.

383
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,916
Hey. Those look like
the corpse from earlier.

384
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,875
The surviving Knights of
the Roman Catholic Church.

385
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,583
Commence the attack, men.

386
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,750
A Gregorian Choir.

387
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:06,916
Huh?

388
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,333
A real Gregorian Choir,

389
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,625
not like the
alchemist's replica.

390
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:11,958
Wait, I'm confused.

391
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,041
You said it took
lots of people

392
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,541
for one of those
Choir things.

393
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,625
Right now, there
are probably

394
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,083
three-thousand-three-
hundred and thirty-three

395
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,708
congregants
offering up prayer

396
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,166
in the Vatican basilica.

397
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,500
Revelation,
Chapter 8, Verse 7...

398
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,416
"The first angel sounded,
and there followed hail

399
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,125
and fire mixed
with blood"...

400
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,791
Hear once more the trumpet
call of the first angel!

401
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,333
That light!

402
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,541
What are these guys doing? !

403
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,458
It's a holy hex
bombardment.

404
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,625
They're attacking it?

405
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,083
But Himegami is
still in there,

406
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,125
not to mention all
those other students!

407
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,041
It's breaking apart!

408
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,041
It's going back up.

409
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,791
Ars Magna.

410
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,333
Ars Magna?

411
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,458
It's the true power
of Aureolus Izzard...

412
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,291
And that's what we're
ultimately going up against.

413
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,875
What are you doing
here, Sphinx?

414
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,916
Don't tell me...
Damn, thought so...

415
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,166
this is part
of Index's robes.

416
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:37,208
[Music]

417
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:47,208
[Music]

418
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:57,208
[Music]

419
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:07,250
[Music]

420
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:15,166
[Music]

421
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,458
Everyone wants a
piece of Index,

422
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:00,041
including this alchemist...

423
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,666
When he shows the full
strength of his power,

424
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,916
it's going to shake the
very foundation of the city.

425
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,625
Next time, "Deep Blood."

426
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:08,875
When science and magic cross
paths, a story is born.
