1
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,833
At a beach resort away
from Academy City,

2
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,208
I was reunited with my
parents and little cousin.

3
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,250
There, we fell victim to
the effects of a spell

4
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,833
called Angel Fall.

5
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,041
A member of the Russian
Orthodox Church showed up,

6
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,750
along with a woman
named Kanzaki,

7
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,125
and, strangely enough,
my friend Tsuchimikado.

8
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,458
As it turns out, he's a
member of Necessarius...

9
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,000
Wait, what?!

10
00:00:52,625 --> 00:01:02,583
[Music]

11
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:08,791
[Music]

12
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,166
It's a simple
explanation, really.

13
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,333
You see, Kami...

14
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,541
I'm a member of
Necessarius, too.

15
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,000
Necessarius...?

16
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,291
Then, you're a...

17
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,333
Yeah... I'm a sorcerer.

18
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,625
But...

19
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,625
But it's impossible for
a sorcerer to live in

20
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,291
Academy City, right...?

21
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,958
Think about it for a minute,
and you'll see, Kami.

22
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,166
Science and magic
are enemies, yes...?

23
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,583
A little bit of espionage
between two rival sides

24
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,500
is hardly surprising...

25
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,625
A double agent
can be very useful.

26
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,583
And that's what you are?

27
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,875
Yes, basically,
I'm a spy...

28
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,416
I know pretty much everything
about you, Kami...

29
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Including, of course, your
Imagine Breaker and its power.

30
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:15,000
But... my job as a spy
comes with a price.

31
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,125
Since I've taken so much
of the esper curriculum,

32
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,041
I can't use my
magic anymore.

33
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,833
At any rate, there's
a good chance that

34
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,083
whoever it was that put
Angel Fall into motion

35
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,041
has gotten close to you
somehow...

36
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,083
The ritual site is
tied to you as well...

37
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,541
We're all going to need to work
together for a little while.

38
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,958
Hopefully then
we can determine

39
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,791
the caster's
purpose and plans.

40
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,458
Misha Kruezhev,
what do you say?

41
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,166
Any objections?

42
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,458
Observation one...

43
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,500
Your suggestion is the
smartest course of action

44
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,708
we can take.

45
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,208
Hey...! I think I should
have a say in this.

46
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,750
I'm with my
family right now,

47
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,625
and I haven't seen them
in a long time...

48
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,833
My parents and my cousin are
staying with me at the inn.

49
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,000
A family reunion,
how touching;

50
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,291
but tell me, do your
parents and cousin

51
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,666
look like they're
supposed to?

52
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,541
My rotten luck.

53
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,000
Good luck charm,
yeah right.

54
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,125
Just a cheap
useless trinket.

55
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,916
The god's power dwells
within replicas.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,166
Or at least, that's what people
who worship idols believe.

57
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,416
I can't believe
you're a sorcerer.

58
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,333
That's not exactly
true, though...

59
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,250
I was a sorcerer.

60
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,208
I was once the most
highly respected

61
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,916
feng shui specialist
in all of Necessarius,

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,458
but now I'm just another
ordinary person.

63
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,041
Aren't you going to go in there
and visit with the others?

64
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,458
Nope I couldn't even
if I wanted to...

65
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,375
When Angel Fall first
went into effect,

66
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,041
Kanzaki and I
put up a barrier

67
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,041
as soon as we realized
what was happening,

68
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,333
but we weren't able
to avoid it entirely.

69
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,166
Judging by the reactions
I've been getting,

70
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,458
I have the rather
dubious luck

71
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,833
of looking like
Hitotsui Hajime.

72
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,041
Wait, I think I
know that name.

73
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,916
You mean that celebrity
guy with the hair?

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,166
So who does
Kanzaki look like?

75
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,833
Interesting...

76
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,833
looks like our Toma has
made some unique friends

77
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,666
while he's been
away at school.

78
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,625
I'll say! You're
totally cool, mister!

79
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,208
With your bright red hair and
that cigarette in your mouth.

80
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,041
Is that a barcode tattooed
on your cheek...?

81
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,625
What's the word
I'm looking for?

82
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,000
It's so...

83
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,208
I think you're trying
to say it's rad,

84
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,458
right, Aunt Shina?

85
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,625
-Yes, that's it.
-Oh, ... right...

86
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,125
almost forgot.

87
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,791
I have some Egyptian
good luck charms here.

88
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,625
Geez...! Enough already
with the souvenirs,

89
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,000
Uncle Toya.

90
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,625
All right, back
to our guest...

91
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,875
What did you say
your name was?

92
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,833
It's Kaori Kanzaki.

93
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:28,833
She looks like Stiyl?!

94
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,625
That's too funny.

95
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,125
Hold on, didn't
you just say

96
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,125
that you and Kanzaki
raised a barrier...?

97
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,416
I thought espers weren't
able to use magic at all.

98
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,000
They shouldn't...

99
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,416
This is the kind of thing
that happens when we do.

100
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,000
I used my magic one more time,

101
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,625
and my blood vessels
burst... Boom! .

102
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,041
It's going to be
the death of me.

103
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,250
Can I ask you
for a favor...?

104
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,666
You know how you're always
moaning about your rotten luck?

105
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,333
It would be best if you
could avoid doing that

106
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,208
in front of Kanzaki.

107
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,416
With her, it's not bad
luck that's the problem...

108
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,291
It's her own good luck that
she can't stand thinking about.

109
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,958
Since when is good
luck a problem?

110
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,541
There is an organization
in Japan called Amakusa--

111
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,375
a secret order of warriors
within the Catholic Church...

112
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,500
Kanzaki was set up as the
organization's top priestess...

113
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,000
She was born into
the position.

114
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,458
They said it
was her destiny.

115
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,958
She's a saint and
a stigma-user...

116
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,791
one of only a handful
in the world...

117
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,541
You know what a
saint is, right...?

118
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,833
A human who carries the power
of God inside of them.

119
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,333
When she releases
her stigma,

120
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,666
she can call
upon that power,

121
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,041
and for a short time,

122
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,291
she has abilities beyond
any normal human...

123
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,333
She can't stand that her
good luck came to her

124
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:37,250
because she happened to be
born under a fortunate star.

125
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,416
Must it always come back
to God with you people...?

126
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,416
So... why does an accident of
birth bother her so much?

127
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,958
I guess that's one
thing only Kanzaki

128
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,791
can ever know for sure...

129
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,250
Just think about
it, though...

130
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,125
How would it feel
to be so blessed?

131
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,125
To be lucky in every
single thing you do?

132
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,541
It's like her life is one
big lottery drawing...

133
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,208
She always wins...

134
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,875
which means she has to watch as
everybody around her loses.

135
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,750
I can't put up with
this any longer.

136
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,041
As it happens, I... Well...

137
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,041
Angel Fall has made
me look like...

138
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,291
I heard about it...

139
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,791
They all think you
look like Stiyl.

140
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,333
Unfortunately.... I'd
like to take a bath

141
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,083
to get the soreness
out of my muscles,

142
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,125
but if I used the women's
baths and someone came in,

143
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,708
there'd be a big scene.

144
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,083
And you wouldn't
be comfortable

145
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,625
using the men's baths if
anyone else came in, either.

146
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,000
Exactly. Which is
why I'd like you

147
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,208
to stand watch out here...

148
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,291
Make sure that
nobody else comes in.

149
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,541
Do you understand?
I'm counting on you, Toma.

150
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,416
Just my luck.

151
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,750
Oh, right. I need to be careful
not to say that around Kanzaki.

152
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,291
Toma... so this is
where you ran off to.

153
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,458
-Oh, Dad.
-This works out perfectly.

154
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,000
What do you say we take
a nice father-son

155
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,083
steam together for
old times' sake?

156
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,083
No, wait, hold on...!
We can't right now.

157
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,583
There's someone in there.

158
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,500
Yeah, so what
if there is...?

159
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,083
This is a hot spring,

160
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,541
that's kind of what
you would expect.

161
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,875
Well, uh, you
see, it's just....

162
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,375
You're acting so
strangely today.

163
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,583
Come on, we're both men.

164
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,916
What is there to be
embarrassed about?

165
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,375
-I'm really sorry.
-Oh, hey...

166
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,000
if it isn't the
cool, red-headed,

167
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,958
cigarette-smoking,
tattooed Kanzaki!

168
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,125
How's it goin'?

169
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,833
Useless.

170
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,333
You'd toss aside
all you owe him over

171
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,458
nothing more than
a little nudity?

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,125
Or have you already
forgotten that Kami saved

173
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,625
Index's life when
no one else could...?

174
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,666
Is seeing you naked a
big deal compared to that?

175
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,416
You should show him
a bit more gratitude.

176
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,916
I haven't forgotten how
much I owe him, but...

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,666
I don't think you
would understand.

178
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,291
Man, you've got some
really weird friends,

179
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,375
you know that, son...?

180
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,958
Why was that guy
so touchy about

181
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,125
sharing the steam
baths with other men?

182
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,875
Oh, that's kind
of a long story.

183
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh, really...? I think I
know what you're getting at.

184
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,916
He plays for the other
team, doesn't he?

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,041
Well that's okay
in this day and age

186
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,083
it's nothing to
be embarrassed about.

187
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,583
Now you're letting your
imagination run away with you...

188
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,125
It's not like that, Dad.

189
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,291
That's right...

190
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,708
If everyone's
appearance is different

191
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,375
because of Angel Fall...

192
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,958
then this might not be what
my dad really looks like.

193
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,291
He could be someone
else entirely.

194
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,375
Hey, Toma... is something
bothering you?

195
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,625
You're so quiet.

196
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,958
Don't worry, Dad.
It's nothing.

197
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,916
Heh... that look reminds
me of your mother.

198
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,041
A long time ago...

199
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,250
before we got married and
were still just dating...

200
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,791
the time would come to say
goodbye for the night...

201
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,708
your mother would get that
exact look on her face...

202
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:33,000
It was difficult for me
to see her like that.

203
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,791
But at the same
time, it was sweet.

204
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,250
You take after your mother
when it comes to looks.

205
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,708
Oh, yeah! I forgot I
have this souvenir

206
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,541
to give you from Mexico.

207
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,583
I don't want it, Dad!

208
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:45,833
Is that Misha?

209
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,416
Yeah, it is.

210
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,916
What a pity...

211
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,916
for such a young
and innocent girl

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,083
to be so troubled
by something...

213
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,333
It almost seems like
she came here hoping

214
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,041
someone would offer
their help...

215
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,625
Good luck, son... I
know you can do it.

216
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,416
Where are you--?

217
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,708
Thanks a lot.

218
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,625
What are you
up to out here?

219
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,416
Uh... I can stay here with
you if you're homesick.

220
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,000
I was on my way back in, but
I'm not rushin' or anything.

221
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,958
That was the worst
pun ever...!

222
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,791
Maybe if I'm lucky she'll
think I was just talking

223
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,708
and not trying to
make a joke.

224
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,583
Want some?

225
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,333
Have you been able to
find out anything

226
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,916
new about Angel Fall?

227
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,250
Okay.

228
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,125
It's not like I know a whole
lot about this angel stuff...

229
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,708
but what's the
caster's goal?

230
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,666
Why would they wanna put a
spell like Angel Fall into play?

231
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,125
Possible reason one...

232
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,083
to gain for themselves
the incredible power

233
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,875
an angel possesses...

234
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,083
or perhaps to
elevate themselves

235
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,041
from human to the
rank of angel.

236
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,958
For the moment, Angel
Fall is incomplete.

237
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,791
Okay, but what
does that mean?

238
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,375
The power of an angel is
great enough that with it,

239
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:31,041
a single person could
bring down the Vatican.

240
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,791
Angel Fall is a
serious threat.

241
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,083
Once complete...

242
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,291
the chaos it unleashes
could destroy the world.

243
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,708
We must discover the
caster's identity quickly.

244
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:41,708
If they complete
the spell,

245
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,250
we will all be doomed.

246
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,083
I guess this is a bad
time to be standing around

247
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,791
chewing gum if it's
that serious...

248
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,791
I'm sorry.

249
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,875
The whole world
is in danger?

250
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,291
What has gotten
into you, Toya?

251
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,958
I can't remember the last
time you were so energetic!

252
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,583
It's like you're
twenty again.

253
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,250
What's the
special occasion?

254
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,625
It's from spending
time with Toma today...

255
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,333
It reminded me
of the past.

256
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,875
Besides... he
always said

257
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,333
he wanted a younger
brother or sister someday.

258
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,750
Oh, my, maybe we
should give him one.

259
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,458
Sorry about this, Misha...

260
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,708
I've got a more
urgent crisis

261
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,416
than the end of the
world on my hands.

262
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,875
Stop right now...!
Stop it! Stop it!

263
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,083
Ah! Toma...! It's
not a good time.

264
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,708
Oh, my, how sweet...

265
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,291
Toma's been away
from us so long

266
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,583
that he wants to sleep
together as a family...

267
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,333
We'll all snuggle
up in bed just like

268
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,875
when he was a little boy.

269
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,666
Oh no...! Oh no...!
What's happened?

270
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,291
Toma isn't in our room...!

271
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,791
It doesn't look like he's been
back at all since last night.

272
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,750
Where are you, Toma?

273
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:56,958
Oh dear, oh dear!

274
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,250
This is terrible.

275
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,500
What's the matter,
sweetheart?

276
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,541
Why's everyone
making so much noise?

277
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,083
It's too early for this.

278
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,458
Toma...!

279
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,250
What's the rush? This is
supposed to be a vacation.

280
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,000
I just realized I forgot
to lock the front door

281
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,208
when we left...

282
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,541
I'm going to go back
and take care of it.

283
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,333
But that's going to take
you most of the day.

284
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,875
It's a pretty
long train ride.

285
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,333
It'll be all right. I should
be back by this evening.

286
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,083
Question one:

287
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,208
Would it be a problem for
me to accompany you?

288
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,708
But why?

289
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,166
I will repeat
question one...

290
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,541
Would it be a problem
for me to accompany you?

291
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,791
That would be lovely...

292
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,583
I never enjoy
traveling alone.

293
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,458
With you along, I'll
have someone to talk to.

294
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,875
Come on, Misha...

295
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:39,916
We'll have a wonderful
time together.

296
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,708
Why would Misha want to go
with Ind--I mean, with Mom?

297
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,083
I knew this would
happen, Toma.

298
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,041
You two must have had
quite a special time

299
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,708
together last night.

300
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:57,916
You must know
what she's doing.

301
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,083
It's the oldest
trick in the book.

302
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,166
She'll get friendly
with your mom

303
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,875
and before you know it,

304
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,083
What the hell are
you talking about?

305
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,333
That's ridiculous.

306
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,625
You certainly seemed to be
enjoying her company last night.

307
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,708
What? Wait just a minute
were you spying on us,

308
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,250
you dirty old pervert...?

309
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,125
Well, if you were, then you
should know nothing happened.

310
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,250
Calm down, I'm just
joking with you...

311
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,666
but you know, son...

312
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,916
it's rare to find a girl who's
that refined nowadays...

313
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,666
So shy and delicate,

314
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,625
she wouldn't even
hold your hand

315
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,958
when you
gave it to her.

316
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,583
Oh... yeah.

317
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,416
My right hand.
She wouldn't touch it.

318
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,208
For the moment, Angel
Fall is incomplete.

319
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,458
Once complete...

320
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,666
the chaos it unleashes
could destroy the world.

321
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,458
Misha really said that?

322
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,666
Yes, she did...

323
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,583
We're not really
clear on the story

324
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,125
behind Angel Fall, right?

325
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,791
It seems like there are
a lot of gaps to fill in.

326
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,041
That's right.

327
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,750
It's a previously
unknown phenomenon.

328
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,041
We've looked everywhere,

329
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,250
but not even the British
Library has anything.

330
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,416
Suppose the caster hasn't
completed the spell...

331
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,333
If that's true...
how would Misha know?

332
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,375
She also said that the spell
would destroy the world...

333
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,625
If it's that unknown,
how can she be sure?

334
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,083
Plus, I would like to
know why she refused

335
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,083
to touch my right hand...

336
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,208
Is it just because she's
incredibly shy...?

337
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,416
Or something else?

338
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,333
So she's the one
who's behind all this.

339
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,875
She doesn't want to
neutralize Angel Fall

340
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,125
while it's in progress.

341
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,041
I think she wants
it to be completed.

342
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,541
Kami... take us to the house.

343
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,875
Right!

344
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,333
Hmm...? You want a
map to the house?

345
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,666
You guys moved, right...?

346
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,708
I need to know the way
to get to the new house.

347
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,583
Why the sudden
interest to see it...?

348
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,958
Your mom will be fine.

349
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,208
You don't need
to go after her.

350
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,666
Wait a minute, I
think I get it now.

351
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,166
There's nothing to get!

352
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,208
It's not your mother you
wanna go running after,

353
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,666
it's that
pretty little Misha--

354
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,791
I've already told you,
there's nothing going on!

355
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,000
-Now hurry!
-All right, all right. Here.

356
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,791
Let's just assume Misha is the
one moving Angel Fall along...

357
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,625
Why would she
go with Index...

358
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,291
I mean my mom.
Why go with her?

359
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,958
No idea... It doesn't
make any sense to me.

360
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,041
To find out, we'll have
to ask Misha personally.

361
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,833
So this is it...

362
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,333
my family's new house.

363
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,791
You here, Mom...? Misha?

364
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,041
The train does
take longer.

365
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,458
We'll have to wait
here until they arrive.

366
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,000
Hey, Kami, look!

367
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,916
Geez...

368
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,625
My old man sure is a
hardcore souvenir collector.

369
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,666
In here, too.

370
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,541
That's my name...
I drew that...?

371
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,583
Nope, nothing... I don't
remember making it.

372
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,375
What's up?
You look troubled.

373
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,041
So it's here.

374
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,791
I never would have expected
something like that.

375
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,541
Is there something
wrong with these?

376
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,083
Don't touch them!

377
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,083
Hey, what's going
on, Tsuchimikado?!

378
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,625
Spit it out, will you?

379
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,000
That's her.

380
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,166
That's my mother.

381
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,708
Huh? Dad?

382
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,958
It's us from
last New Year's.

383
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,250
See, that's you and me.

384
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,208
Do you remember me now...?
Please, say you do.

385
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,666
He's the same here......

386
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,291
and here, too.

387
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,958
That means my father...

388
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,583
wasn't affected
by the spell.

389
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,833
What does this mean?
Explain it to me.

390
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,458
Angel Fall
doesn't affect you

391
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,208
because of Imagine Breaker.

392
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,583
Aside from that,
there is only one person

393
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,166
who wouldn't be
touched by it.

394
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,958
And that's the person
who is responsible

395
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,791
for casting the spell.

396
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,250
Oh dear, oh dear!

397
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,833
I can't believe
I did that...

398
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,125
How silly of me!

399
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,750
Ah...! It's
Hitotsui Hajime!

400
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,250
I have no idea
what you're doing here,

401
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,583
but I don't care...!

402
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,750
I have to tell you...

403
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,208
I'm one of your
absolute biggest fans!

404
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,041
Go, Kami... Now!

405
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,833
Have you forgotten what
Misha was going to do

406
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,875
when she thought you
were the caster?

407
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,208
How is this possible, Dad?

408
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,208
How could you be
responsible for this?

409
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,125
And what are you doing
getting yourself

410
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,041
involved with the occult?

411
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,166
Hey, watch where
you're going!

412
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,416
You got a death wish?

413
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,750
Uh... Himegami...?

414
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:27,916
Get outta the way, kid...

415
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,083
Move or I run you
over, ya got me?

416
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,250
Hey... what're you doing?

417
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,541
Please just give me
a ride. I'm begging you!

418
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,041
What the hell?

419
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,500
Does it look like I'm
running a taxi service here?

420
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,083
This is important...

421
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,208
It's my father. I think
his life is in danger!

422
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,375
What?

423
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,583
If I don't get to him,
he'll die...!

424
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,625
I have to save
him somehow.

425
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,666
Please help me!

426
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,416
Oh man! You sure
know how to tug at

427
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,750
a guy's heartstrings,
don't you...?

428
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,041
Such a good, dutiful
son in this day and age!

429
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,416
All right!

430
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,375
You better get that
seatbelt fastened on tight...

431
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,125
I won't take the blame
if you go flying.

432
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,416
Come on, come on,
come on, come on...!

433
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Move it, move it,
move it, move it!

434
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,708
-Where is Misha?
-Where's my father...?

435
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,416
I need to find
my dad right now...

436
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,875
and Misha, too.

437
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,708
That's what I wanted
to ask you about.

438
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,000
You were the one
chasing after her...

439
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,958
As for Mr. oya,
he's at the beach...

440
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,916
What exactly is going on?

441
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,208
I see.

442
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,875
I want you to remain
here for the moment.

443
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,666
Given what you've told
me, this is my task now...

444
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,041
I will take
Mr. oya into my--

445
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,500
Not happening.

446
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,208
I'm going to take
care of this, not you.

447
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,833
-But, Toma
-"But" nothing, Kanzaki!

448
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,208
Don't you see? Toya
Kamijo is my father!

449
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,000
He's the only
dad I have...

450
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,250
This is up to me.

451
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,916
Dad...

452
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:37,000
[Music]

453
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,708
When a being that transcends
human understanding appears,

454
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,000
Kanzaki steps forward

455
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,333
to keep it from
destroying the world...

456
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:03,916
As for Tsuchimikado...

457
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,833
Next time,
"The Power of God."

458
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:08,875
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
