1
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,083
I thought Misaka's
sister was dead...

2
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,708
Then suddenly more and more
versions of her appeared...

3
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,125
How many sisters
can one person have?

4
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,625
It turned out
that these clones

5
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,833
are part of a
military experiment.

6
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,375
There's something
very wrong happening

7
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,958
here in Academy City...

8
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,541
I need to find
that human bug zapper

9
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:48,916
and see how much she knows.

10
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:56,791
[Music]

11
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,458
So, you wanna know what
extra-sensory perception is?

12
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,583
I can explain best by
putting it in the context

13
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,041
of Schrödinger's theory.

14
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,416
I've never heard of him.

15
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,250
He was a professor
of quantum mechanics.

16
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,583
He's best known for the

17
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,500
Schrödinger's cat
thought experiment...

18
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,250
The premise itself
is a bit morbid,

19
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,750
so I'll alter it
for our purposes.

20
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,708
Now, as you can see, I'm
holding a box here in my hand.

21
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:51,000
Without opening it, guess
what's inside the box.

22
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,833
That's a silly question;
it's chocolate, of course...

23
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,750
It says right there it's
a box of chocolates.

24
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,375
No, sorry. You're wrong...

25
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,083
There are actually
hard candies inside.

26
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,458
No fair...!
That was a trick.

27
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,791
The meat is done.

28
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,416
Okay, Sister,
guess again...

29
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,625
What do you suppose is
hidden inside the box.

30
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,666
But you already
told me the answer.

31
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,708
You said it was
hard candies.

32
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:11,916
That's right...

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,375
but have you considered
the possibility

34
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,666
that I might be
lying to you?

35
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,958
So it's equally probable
that the box contains

36
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,791
chocolate or hard candy.

37
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,333
We won't know
unless we open it.

38
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,750
So, let's see...

39
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,916
It's not really chock
full of chocolate.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,500
Pardon the pun.

41
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,250
All right, now
we do it again...

42
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,916
Tell me, Sister, what do
you suppose is inside the box?

43
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,750
You already showed me
there was chocolate inside.

44
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,750
Most people would answer
the same way as you:

45
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,625
they'd be 100% certain that
the box contains chocolate.

46
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,708
But what if there was
someone who believed

47
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,875
it was hard candy instead?

48
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,333
And what if
they opened the box

49
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,208
to find their
belief was reality?

50
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,791
Then that person would be
what we call an esper...

51
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,666
Such people can split
themselves off

52
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,916
from mainstream reality
and create a reality

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,041
that exists uniquely
for themselves.

54
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,208
How could they?

55
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,708
Why did everything have
to end up this way?

56
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,416
Excuse me.

57
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,958
Are you Mikoto Misaka?

58
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,208
It's very nice
to meet you.

59
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,000
You know what
paralysis is, right?

60
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:38,916
It's when a person has
lost the use of one

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,250
or more of their limbs.

62
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,916
Many people
suffer from this.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,958
In a healthy body,
commands from the brain

64
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,375
are sent to the muscles
through electrical signals.

65
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,291
Paralysis is caused when
these signals cannot be sent,

66
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,625
but if we had the power
to control bioelectricity,

67
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,000
we might be
able to cure it.

68
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,375
By making use of your
particular ability,

69
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,375
we could help many
thousands of people.

70
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,416
Hey... did you hear?

71
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,833
There's a rumor
that they're making

72
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,458
military clones
in Academy City!

73
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:09,541
Yeah, and supposedly they're
using a Level 5's DNA map.

74
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,583
You don't think it's that
girl in our class, do ya?

75
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,250
Who needs you anyway!

76
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,958
Help us.

77
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,250
Somebody help us.

78
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,333
It's a cat.

79
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,875
Hey...

80
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,375
What do you think
you're doing...?

81
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,750
Answer me.

82
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,291
What's it to you? I can do
what I want when I want.

83
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,041
It's one of the privileges of
being the Level 5 Railgun...

84
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,958
Most people are smart
enough to stay clear

85
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,333
and not mess with me...

86
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,125
Any punk who
does is toast.

87
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,708
So maybe you should just
mind your own business

88
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,583
and leave me to mine.

89
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,958
Not gonna happen.

90
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,666
What's the big deal...?

91
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,000
Is your pride
still hurting

92
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,250
over the whole vending
machine episode yesterday?

93
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,583
You hoping to get me in
trouble for being out at night?

94
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,541
"An analysis of Tree
Diagram calculations

95
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,083
has been conducted."

96
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,500
"The optimal plan
would involve

97
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,708
creating 128
different battlefields

98
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,666
upon which Railgun
would be killed.

99
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,958
After that number
of victories,

100
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,791
Accelerator would then
advance to Level 6."

101
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,791
"Since that number of
Railguns cannot be produced,

102
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,833
a different plan
has been developed...

103
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,541
This plan will involve
the mass-production

104
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,708
of Railgun's
Level 5 "Sisters."

105
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,833
The numbers have
been adjusted."

106
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:04,958
"It has been
determined that

107
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,333
twenty thousand

00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,291
and a corresponding
number of Sister deaths

109
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,125
will be needed to produce
the desired results."

110
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,875
Essentially that means...

111
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:13,958
Your younger
sisters were created

112
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,291
so they could be killed

113
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,833
as part of an experiment
to produce a Level 6.

114
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,833
Shame on you...
poking your nose in

115
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,083
where it
doesn't belong...

116
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,083
I had that file
securely hidden...

117
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,666
The fact that you're
holding it means

118
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,666
that you've been in my room
without my permission.

119
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,083
Normally I'd kill someone
for pulling a stunt like that.

120
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,375
Why are you here...?

121
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,708
Did you come because
reading the file

122
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,833
made you concerned
about me...?

123
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,333
Or just to tell me
you're disgusted?

124
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,083
Of course it made me
concerned about you.

125
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,541
You know, it's
surprisingly nice

126
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,333
to hear somebody say that,
even if it isn't the truth.

127
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,333
But it is the truth.

128
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,791
It's not.

129
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,458
I'm telling you,
I mean what I say!

130
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,291
I'm sorry for going in your
room without permission...

131
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,458
You can zap me as many
times as you want later,

132
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,125
I don't care...

133
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,500
Please, you have to tell
me what's going on here.

134
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,791
However you came
to have these plans,

135
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,875
I'm guessing it
wasn't legal.

136
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:13,458
Why are all those
laboratories marked like this?

137
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,041
Think about it for a sec.

138
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,666
They kind of look like
targets... don't they?

139
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,291
Because that's what
they are... Or were...

140
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,916
In the end
I decided against

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,750
using my Railgun
on all of them.

142
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,583
A high-tech
laboratory costs

143
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,916
hundreds of millions
to equip, right...?

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,333
If I wanted to,
I could use my powers

145
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,958
to short-circuit
everything.

146
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,250
It wouldn't be hard...

147
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,541
With the
equipment useless,

148
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,833
the lab would shut down...

149
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,125
and the project
would be stopped.

150
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,791
At least, that's what
was supposed to happen.

151
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,458
What happened instead?

152
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,833
It turns out...

153
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,416
it doesn't matter
how much I wreck,

154
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,166
the project is immediately
picked up by another lab.

155
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,666
All those scientists are
probably salivating

156
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,541
at the thought of being the ones
to create the first Level 6.

157
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,000
Know what they
call themselves...?

158
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,291
My sisters call themselves
laboratory rats,

159
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,875
and they really
believe it, too.

160
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,833
They know exactly
what's going on...

161
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,625
and what it
means for them.

162
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,166
But isn't human
cloning prohibited

163
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,000
under international law?

164
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,416
I think if you told
the governing board

165
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,791
what was happening...

166
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,791
Academy City is
under the watchful eye

167
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,791
of the Tree
Diagram satellite...

168
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:21,291
That means they have the
board's tacit approval.

169
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,166
At any rate, I'm the one who's
at the root of this problem...

170
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,958
They wouldn't be in this
if it weren't for me,

171
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,916
so I'm the one who
needs to save them.

172
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,291
It's pretty simple
when you think about it...

173
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,708
This experiment
is all about

174
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:37,875
building
Accelerator's ability.

175
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,125
The project revolves
around him,

176
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,500
so if he were
to disappear,

177
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,000
there would be no
reason for it to exist.

178
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,416
It'll never work.

179
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,916
You can't defeat Accelerator
in a fair fight, can you...?

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,625
From what I know
about you, if you could,

181
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,916
that would've been the
very first thing you tried.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,916
Since he's still
around, that means

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,750
you know beating
him is impossible.

184
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,125
You might be close,

185
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,375
but you're no match for
Accelerator, are you?

186
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,541
Why didn't you just
ask somebody for help...?

187
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,833
Once you knew you
couldn't do it yourself,

188
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,041
why not reach out

189
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,000
and ask someone to
help you take him down?

190
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:14,208
Why did they create
twenty-thousand Sisters?

191
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:18,375
Because they weren't able
to create 128 Railguns.

192
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:22,333
And what did they need 128
Railguns for in the first place?

193
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,833
Because by killing
Railgun 128 times,

194
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,708
Accelerator would
advance to Level 6.

195
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,666
What if...

196
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,541
What if I wasn't actually
worth as much as they think?

197
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,416
Accelerator is
supposed to develop

198
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,125
from repeated experience
in hard combat...

199
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,833
What if the project
leaders could be convinced

200
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,916
that wouldn't happen?

201
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,208
You know, they actually
used Tree Diagram

202
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,583
to determine exactly how a
fight between Accelerator

203
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,250
and me would play out.

204
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,791
The computer calculated that
I would die after 185 moves.

205
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,625
But, you see... if I was
to be unceremoniously beaten

206
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,666
after the very
first move...

207
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,166
Well, faced
with that data,

208
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,041
surely the researchers
would have to conclude

209
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,500
that something was wrong with
the original programming.

210
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,666
Yeah... but even if
you fooled them once,

211
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,375
wouldn't they just
do some recalculations

212
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,375
and start things
back up again?

213
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,458
They wouldn't
be able to...

214
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,208
That's what makes
this plan so perfect.

215
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,250
The Tree Diagram satellite
was actually attacked

216
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,833
from the ground and brought
down a few weeks back...

217
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,458
The source of the attack
hasn't been determined.

218
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,708
There could be no
recalculations...

219
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,666
Regardless of how much
data they have,

220
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,041
without the computer
to analyze it,

221
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:31,000
they'd have no choice
but to stop the project.

222
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,916
So that's it...
I get it.

223
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,791
Basically, you
want to die.

224
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,291
Yeah.

225
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,333
You believe that by
sacrificing yourself,

226
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,958
you can save the ten thousand
Sisters who remain...

227
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,625
Is that right?

228
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,125
That's the plan.

229
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,583
I'm actually on my way to
see Accelerator right now...

230
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,291
and once I'm done...

231
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,791
This whole twisted experiment
will come to an end.

232
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,625
Stand aside.

233
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,125
I'm not moving.

234
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,833
You idiot! Don't you realize
what's on the line, here? !

235
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,375
If I don't do this,

236
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,500
then ten thousand of my
Sisters are going to be killed!

237
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,958
Or are you so
heartless you think

238
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,333
since they're just
a bunch of clones,

239
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,000
it's no big deal
if they die? !

240
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,208
Not at all.

241
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,333
I think their deaths
would be a tragedy...

242
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,833
but I also think there must
be some other way to stop it.

243
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,541
I'm not gonna
let you do this.

244
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,125
So... You really mean to
stand in my way...

245
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,916
You're choosing
my single life

246
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,083
over the lives of ten
thousand of my Sisters.

247
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,041
Don't you get it...? I
can't bear to stand by

248
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,875
and do nothing
while they die.

249
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,291
I'm going to save
them by myself.

250
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,041
This is the last
warning I'll give you...

251
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,375
Get out of my way!

252
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,625
I'm still not sure
what kind of power

253
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,416
you used against me before.

254
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,791
But I do know I can't
afford to lose to you today!

255
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:57,875
So you'd better
be ready to fight

256
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:01,166
like your life
depends on it.

257
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,333
Otherwise...

258
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,583
You'll be the
one who dies.

259
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,041
What're you doing...?

260
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,750
Why are you standing
there like that?

261
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,500
You're seriously going to
try to stop me, aren't you?

262
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,125
All right, then...

263
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,541
You should know I'm
not going to hold back.

264
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,333
I'm going to get by you
one way or another...

265
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,875
Even if I have
to shoot you!

266
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,000
I won't fight you.

267
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,083
Whatever you do... I won't.

268
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,083
Then just stand aside...

269
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,625
Let me do this...

270
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:09,041
Why can't you see there are no
other options left to me...?

271
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,083
This isn't some petty problem
that will just go away.

272
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,500
It's evil like you've
never seen before...

273
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,750
It's the slaughter of ten
thousand innocent people!

274
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,666
Passive resistance
isn't the solution

275
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,208
to a problem like this!

276
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,041
It doesn't matter.

277
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,833
Do what you want, but
I won't fight you.

278
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,250
I'm telling you right
now, you will fight me.

279
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,500
Like it or not...

280
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,000
You will fight me!

281
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,833
Last chance...

282
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,666
I won't miss with
the next one.

283
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,208
If you wanna stop me, step
up and fight like a man...

284
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,625
and if you won't, then get
the hell out of my way!

285
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,208
Don't pretend to understand
the situation I'm in.

286
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,875
Someone like you
could never get it!

287
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,250
Oh, no.

288
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,833
Why? Why?

289
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:10,625
I don't get it...

290
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,750
Why won't you fight me?

291
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,375
I don't... know why.

292
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,625
I don't really
think I can give you

293
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,000
a clear reason for it...

294
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,875
It's just how I feel...

295
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,458
I don't know what to do...

296
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,458
and I don't know if there
are any other solutions.

297
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,458
But I do know...

298
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,083
I don't want this.

299
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,666
I don't want to see
you get hurt Mikoto...

300
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,041
I can't let you do it.

301
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,291
It's not right...

302
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,958
It's not right that
you should have to die.

303
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,291
No one should...

304
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,958
Why does anyone
have to die tonight?

305
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,500
I can't believe that
that's the only way!

306
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,291
Help me.

307
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,375
Somebody help me.

308
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,875
Just shut up, you fool.

309
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,791
Stop babbling comforting
words trying to reassure me.

310
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:06,750
I promise I don't
deserve it, not anymore.

311
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,500
Maybe the world you live in
is full of happy endings...

312
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,625
Maybe good always
triumphs over evil.

313
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,000
Not for me...

314
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,625
There's no place for me
in a world like that.

315
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,875
Why can't you
see the truth?

316
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,833
Your death isn't
the answer....

317
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,166
It won't help
anyone in the end.

318
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,833
Say you die...

319
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,666
and your Sisters
survive...

320
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,625
Say your sacrifice
actually does save them

321
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,250
from being killed
by Accelerator.

322
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,750
Do you think they'll be
grateful for what you did...?

323
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,000
Do you think they
want to be saved

324
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,083
at the expense
of your life? !

325
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,583
Just shut up!

326
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,125
Don't talk about things
you can't understand...

327
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,875
Do you think I'm
some kind of saint?

328
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,541
Because I can
assure you I'm not.

329
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,750
Why don't you get it...?

330
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,291
You know full well
I'm responsible

331
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,166
for the deaths of thousands.

332
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,208
I deserve to
be punished...

333
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,000
There's no place for a monster
like me in this world...

334
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,791
Not anymore.

335
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,833
Why are you even
doing this...?

336
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:18,875
Why are you
risking your life

337
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,083
to stick up for a
monster like me? !

338
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,625
You're not a monster.

339
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,750
If you were, I wouldn't
still be alive.

340
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,583
There's no way I should
still be standing here

341
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:32,458
after taking a direct
body hit like that.

342
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,208
You must've been
subconsciously holding back.

343
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,833
Holding back?

344
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,166
No way. I gave
it all I had...

345
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,291
I meant it when I said I
was going to kill you...

346
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,083
I knew you weren't going
to make any moves

347
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,833
to fight back at me...

348
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,500
-but even so
-Admit the truth...

349
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,291
You couldn't bring
yourself to kill me.

350
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,583
You just couldn't do it...

351
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,791
Saving your Sisters is the
most important thing to you...

352
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,916
and maybe you hate me for
standing in your way like this.

353
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,625
But here I am...

354
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,125
Ultimately, you're
a good enough person

355
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,833
that you couldn't
kill me...

356
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,416
even though I stood
between you and your goal.

357
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,875
I'm trying to do
something good here...

358
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,583
by sacrificing myself
so they won't die.

359
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,458
That should be enough
reason to do it!

360
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,583
You're making way
this too complicated.

361
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,541
I die they live. It's simple!

362
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,708
And more than that,
it's the right thing to do!

363
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,250
Step aside and let me
do what I know is right!

364
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,958
I won't.

365
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,125
Then you'll die.

366
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,833
There's no way you'll
survive this next attack...

367
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,416
Not if you stand there
and take it head-on.

368
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,833
Now move...

369
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,875
Unless you want this
to be your death!

370
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,041
I won't move.

371
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,583
Don't get up.

372
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,083
No... Please stop.

373
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,250
Please don't...
I can't do this.

374
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:40,375
[Music]

375
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:50,416
[Music]

376
00:21:50,500 --> 00:22:00,416
[Music]

377
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:11,416
[Music]

378
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,083
She told me...

379
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,750
she has no choice
but to die.

380
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,541
She doesn't want to die...

381
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,125
She shouldn't
have to die...

382
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,166
But she says she
has no choice.

383
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,041
There has to be
some other option.

384
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:26,208
Just think... there
has to be a way...

385
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:28,083
There must be
something else...

386
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,875
All those scientists are
probably salivating

387
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:34,791
at the thought of being the ones
to create the first Level 6.

388
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,875
To stop the experiment,
we have to make them think

389
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,166
that their original
premise was incorrect...

390
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,875
With the computer gone,

391
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:48,500
they'll have no choice
but to abandon the project.

392
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,000
Maybe...

393
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:57,666
One of Misaka's Sisters

394
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,291
is headed for
the testing grounds,

395
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:02,333
where the strongest Level
5 in Academy City waits...

396
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,125
What will become of
her when they meet?

397
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:05,750
Next time, "Accelerator."

398
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:09,208
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
