1
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,666
Not again.

2
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,958
They're all dead...

3
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,916
They are dead
because of me.

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,958
[Music]

5
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,250
Rotten luck.

6
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,583
Seriously...

7
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,500
Who would've expected a
textbook to cost so much?

8
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,333
It's extortion.

9
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:47,000
Toma...

10
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,375
What do you think you
would've done with the money

11
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,583
if you hadn't had
to buy that book?

12
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,125
I don't wanna
think about it.

13
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,416
No... An... swer... me!

14
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,083
What could you
have bought?

15
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,416
Yeah, okay,
I get it already.

16
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,833
If I had studied regularly,

17
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,083
I wouldn't have
had to buy a...

18
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,125
Hey... what're
you staring at?

19
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,125
No way. Nobody can eat

20
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,208
thirty-six-hundred yen
worth of ice cream...

21
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,208
even you.

22
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,583
Excuse me...! I haven't
complained even once

23
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,916
about how hot and
uncomfortable I am

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,541
in this miserable heat...

25
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,333
And I certainly didn't imply
that I'd use your money

26
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,791
to buy something
for myself.

27
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,000
So why would you suggest

28
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,208
that I was thinking
anything about

29
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,000
buying a bunch
of ice cream?

30
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,250
Okay, I'm sorry.

31
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,916
I didn't realize you were
so uncomfortable out here...

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,875
Let's find someplace to
sit inside for a while.

33
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,291
Why should we...?

34
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,833
These robes represent
the lord's protection.

35
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,333
I wear them proudly.

36
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,875
I would never dream
of complaining

37
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,125
about how unwieldy and
suffocating they are...

38
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,458
Apparently, I knew this
chatty nun before the incident

39
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,166
that landed me
in the hospital.

40
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,250
I say "apparently"
for a reason...

41
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:56,500
I can't remember anything
before the last two weeks.

42
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,708
I'm not entirely
sure why...

43
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,291
but for some reason,

44
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,625
I wanna keep my memory loss
a secret from everyone else.

45
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,833
Everyone...
but most importantly,

46
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,541
I wanna keep this
girl from finding out.

47
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,875
I don't understand,
but somehow...

48
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,125
a part of me remembers
who she is...

49
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,416
Her smiles...

50
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,708
and her tears.

51
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,833
Hey, Toma...! Are you even
paying attention to me...?

52
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:22,875
I was explaining
that as a nun,

53
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,458
I live a life of austerity.

54
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,875
Therefore, I am
forbidden from indulging

55
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,791
in a tasty treat
like ice cream.

56
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,375
I guess that
settles it then...

57
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,875
I wouldn't want you to
break a rule or anything.

58
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,291
Of course, while all
nuns are told to abstain,

59
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,375
I am still a novice,
so surely they can't expect me

60
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,375
to exhibit perfect
behavior all the time.

61
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,208
Certain allowances must be
made for the younger sisters...

62
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,833
For instance, should
a scoop of ice cream

63
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,583
accidentally fall
into my mouth,

64
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,458
surely no one would expect
me to abstain from eating it.

65
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,875
What choice would I have?

66
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,958
Hey-o!

67
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,500
Sorry to interrupt, Kami.

68
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,583
Looks like you're having

69
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,333
a pretty intense
discussion over there.

70
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,416
Wanna introduce us
to your lady friend?

71
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,375
Huh...?

72
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,750
Ah, c'mon, dude, don't tell
me you don't know her name...

73
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,791
What, is the heat giving
you amnesia or something?

74
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,375
Calm down,
I'm just kidding.

75
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,791
It's not hot enough out
here to boil your brains

76
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,958
unless you combine it
with some serious partying.

77
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,416
Well, man...

78
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,250
you gonna tell us your
little friend's name or not?

79
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,166
Let me guess: is it a dude
dressed up as a chick?

80
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,500
Kinda flat to be a girl,
if you know what I mean.

81
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,208
Geez, guys, there
are some things

82
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,750
you just don't
say out loud...

83
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,791
Sure she's a little on
the small side, but...

84
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,125
Toma...

85
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,916
Gentlemen, I think
you should know

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,375
I am a nun of the English
Puritan Church...

87
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,125
If there is anything you
would like to repent,

88
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,333
I will be happy to listen
to your transgressions.

89
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,666
Shakes for me...!
Shakes for me!

90
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,708
Three milkshakes,
and they're all for me!

91
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,250
Thanks for the grub, Kami!

92
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,458
How'd I forget my wallet?

93
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,833
How did all of this
end up being my treat?

94
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,375
My stupid luck.

95
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,791
Toma...! We're over here!

96
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,666
Wow... found a booth...

97
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,875
This is not good...

98
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,208
so not good!

99
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,041
Um... is something wrong?

100
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,166
Ugh...

101
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,666
Er... are you in
some kind of pain?

102
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,125
I ate myself to ruin.

103
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,125
On three, guys...

104
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,541
Ready. One, two, three...!

105
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,708
One, two, three!

106
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:33,416
Yeah!

107
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,791
Excuse me...

108
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,958
You ate yourself
to ruin...? How?

109
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:43,125
The hamburgers were
only a hundred yen each.

110
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,166
And on top of that, I had
a bunch of coupons to use.

111
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,958
Before I knew it,
I'd ordered thirty of them.

112
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,625
Overdid it a little...

113
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:53,583
didn't you?

114
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,500
Uh... sorry,
I didn't mean to, uh...

115
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,750
Comfort food.

116
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,208
Huh?

117
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,041
I need a return
train ticket...

118
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,791
It's six hundred yen.

119
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,916
Okay, so what?

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,458
I only have five hundred...
I'm short.

121
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,083
That's a shame, huh?

122
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,583
It was dumb. I bought
too many burgers.

123
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,833
And then I had
to eat them all.

124
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,416
Sorry about that...

125
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,375
Maybe you could borrow the
money you need for a ticket

126
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,041
from a friend
or something.

127
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:29,250
Oh...! That's a great
idea, thank you.

128
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,625
She is majorly hot!

129
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,000
I need a shot of her.

130
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,583
Uh... why are you
looking at me...?

131
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,458
Do you expect a handout
from a perfect stranger?

132
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,750
It's not much...

133
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,750
Come on.

134
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,125
No way...

135
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,916
I don't go around
handing out money.

136
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,833
Can't even spare
a hundred yen.

137
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,250
Hey, I'm not the one

138
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,750
who wasted all of my travel
money on hamburgers.

139
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,541
A perfect way to speak
to a beautiful priestess

140
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,875
such as her...

141
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,458
You've got a real way
with the ladies, Kami.

142
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,666
Beautiful?

143
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,708
I am beautiful. You
want to give me money.

144
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,416
I don't have any
to give you...!

145
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,291
These guys already
cleaned out my cash.

146
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,500
I can't afford to make
any more loans right now.

147
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,875
And you?

148
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,833
Oh no...! Why's
she asking me?

149
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,000
It's not much.

150
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,791
Nope, sorry, lady.
Don't look at me!

151
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:16,916
You took my picture.

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,416
What...? You're
charging me...?

153
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,458
It was just one picture!

154
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,833
Oh, I see...

155
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,708
The priestesses in this
town like their publicity.

156
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:25,833
You're wrong...

157
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,375
I'm not a priestess.

158
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,666
Huh...? Look at the
way you're dressed.

159
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,791
It's classic priestess.

160
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,458
That's too bad...

161
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,333
I am a magician.

162
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,666
Oh, you're a magician,
are you...?

163
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,416
I suppose you can
prove it, then...

164
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,666
I wanna hear your specialty,
your sect, your magic name,

165
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,791
and your order name.

166
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:43,875
But you probably
have no idea

167
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,041
what I'm talking
about, do you?

168
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,458
In that outfit, about the
best you can hope for is

169
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,916
passing yourself off as some
wacky itinerant astrologer

170
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,333
who's between jobs.

171
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,708
Yeah, sure, that's me.

172
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,875
Look, it's simple.

173
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,041
She used to be
a priestess,

174
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,833
but now she's some
kinda magician....

175
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,833
Just take it easy.

176
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,250
That's nice...!

177
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,875
You've changed a lot since
the first time we met,

178
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,375
haven't you, Toma?

179
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,958
Uh... I'm just taking
her at her word.

180
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:12,958
Why is that
such a big deal?

181
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,333
Why is it a big deal?!

182
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,000
You had to strip
off all my clothes

183
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,833
before you'd believe
I was the real thing.

184
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,583
Huh...? What's she saying about
stripping off her clothes?!

185
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,875
Who're all the
dudes in suits?

186
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,041
And when'd they get here?

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,833
I need a hundred
yen, please.

188
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:37,791
Who are these guys...?

189
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,708
Are they acquaintances
or something?

190
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,625
Yes... they're my teachers.

191
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,125
Those are teachers...?

192
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,166
Seriously?

193
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,083
That's weird.

194
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,166
Why are teachers
tracking down a student

195
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,750
at a fast food restaurant?

196
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,500
What is it...?
Is something wrong?

197
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,000
Did you have to
say that stuff about

198
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,833
taking off all
your clothes...?

199
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,500
We don't want word getting out
that you're staying with me.

200
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,708
Yeah, I guess so...

201
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,166
What's more...

202
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,583
what was I thinking
making friends with people

203
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:19,833
like those two?

204
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,625
Toma!

205
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,625
Hey, look at this...!

206
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,041
Here!

207
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,708
An abandoned cat... Huh.

208
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,250
So I was thinking...

209
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,125
-Maybe...
-No way.

210
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,208
Hey...! I haven't told you
what I was thinking yet!

211
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,583
We can't keep the cat.

212
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,958
But why not, Toma...?

213
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,125
Sphinx needs a new home.

214
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,625
Why can't we keep him?

215
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,291
The student dorms
don't allow pets,

216
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,875
so there's no way
that Sphinx could...

217
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,583
Hey what're you doing
naming it already?

218
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,083
It's not fair...!

219
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,833
He's mine! He's mine!
He's mine! He's mine!

220
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,041
I said no, and I mean it.

221
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,458
You see...? You scared him,
and now he's run off.

222
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,666
It's your fault!

223
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,208
How's it my fault?

224
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,250
I heard that there's
a Japanese instrument

225
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,375
that's partially made
out of cat skins...

226
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,666
How could Sphinx
not be scared

227
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,541
with stuff like
that going on?

228
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,125
Well if you wanna go there,
don't the English chase foxes?

229
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,583
Foxhunting is a noble
sport dating back...

230
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,500
What is that?

231
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,583
I can feel magic flows
coming together nearby.

232
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:22,708
Magic what?

233
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,750
Its color is green...

234
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,666
Its attribute is earth...

235
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,875
Is it a runic formula?

236
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,041
Hey... where are you going?

237
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,833
It feels like someone is
setting up a magic circle.

238
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,166
You go on home without me.

239
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,333
Go on home, she says.

240
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,458
What is she, my mother?

241
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,625
Something seems...

242
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,000
off.

243
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,208
You should know
what's happening...

244
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,708
The runes are designed
to keep people away.

245
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,458
Long time no see, huh...?

246
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,000
Toma Kamijo.

247
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,833
Long time no see, huh...?

248
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,500
Toma Kamijo.

249
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,750
Oh, man...

250
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,666
Who's he?

251
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,625
What...? I don't
even get a hello?

252
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,125
Good. That's the way it
should be between you and me.

253
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,333
Where's Index?

254
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,458
There's no need to
worry about her...

255
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,833
She's just off investigating

256
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,166
a magical force
she discovered, right?

257
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,333
Wow...

258
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,625
What the hell kind
of life was I living...?

259
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,875
Was every day full of
weird sorcery stuff?

260
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,541
So...

261
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,958
was there something
you wanted from me?

262
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,541
Don't take me
lightly, boy...

263
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,708
I could kill you.

264
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,625
Oh, I see...

265
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,666
so that's how it works.

266
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,833
There. That's more like it.

267
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,625
That face is more suited
to our relationship.

268
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,416
We can't start
getting all chummy

269
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,000
just because we happened to
fight on the same side one time.

270
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,208
What's that?

271
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,750
What are you reaching for?

272
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,041
It's a confidential matter.

273
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,791
Huh?!

274
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,291
Take a closer look.

275
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,583
Have you ever heard of
Misawa Prep School...?

276
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,583
It's here in Academy City.

277
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,625
Misawa... yeah, sure.

278
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,666
Okay... There's a young girl
who's being held captive there.

279
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,333
Held captive?!

280
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,583
Apparently, the school's
had some changes...

281
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,750
It has become the base
of a pseudo-religion

282
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,333
that centers around
the worship of science...

283
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,250
We don't know
all the specifics...

284
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,333
What we do know for sure

285
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,541
is that the school's
been taken over.

286
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,000
They are now led by a
bona fide, sorcerer...

287
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,916
Actually, to be
more precise...

288
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,750
an alchemist of the
Zurich school of alchemy.

289
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,750
He's the real deal?

290
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,625
I know...

291
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,875
It sounded like a pretty dubious
story to me at first, too.

292
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,958
Hey... wait a sec.

293
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,708
You're accepting
this too easily.

294
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,166
Not good...

295
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,125
If he realizes I've
lost my memory...

296
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,000
I actually listen
to you for once,

297
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,666
and this is what I get?

298
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,041
Are you one of those people

299
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,958
who always has to have
something to complain about?

300
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,583
Well, whatever...

301
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,208
I don't mind if this
goes more smoothly

302
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,291
than last time around.

303
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,458
The alchemist in question is
known as Aureolus Izzard...

304
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,708
He dropped out
of sight completely

305
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,708
about three years ago.

306
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:36,041
Wherever he was and whatever
he was doing in that time...

307
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,666
he's suddenly decided
to show his face again.

308
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,208
Why would he do that?

309
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,708
Yes... his motivation is
what has us so concerned.

310
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,875
He's after Deep Blood...

311
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,416
That's the girl
I was talking about,

312
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,166
the one held in the
Misawa Prep School.

313
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,333
Her name is Deep Blood?

314
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,833
The name of her power...

315
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,291
She possesses the ability to
destroy a certain creature.

316
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,541
What creature...?

317
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,291
What are you talking about?

318
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,458
They go by many names...

319
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,833
To put it simply...

320
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,250
I'm talking about vampires.

321
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,375
What?! That's crazy!

322
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,125
You're telling me that
vampires actually exist?

323
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,916
Unfortunately,
not even we sorcerers

324
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,916
are sure of all the details.

325
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,500
Basically, Deep Blood
is how sorcerers refer

326
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,041
to the ability to
kill vampires...

327
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,958
Naturally, in order
to kill these creatures,

328
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,916
you must first make
contact with them...

329
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,375
And if you're going
to make contact,

330
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,583
you wanna make sure you have
something like Deep Blood

331
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,583
at your disposal.

332
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,708
I don't get it...

333
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,125
what are you
trying to tell me?

334
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,041
I have a bit
of a problem...

335
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,291
I've been given an
assignment, you see...

336
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,166
I must stage a raid
on Misawa Prep School

337
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,750
to retrieve Deep Blood.

338
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,000
I wouldn't be nodding so
quickly if I were you...

339
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,791
You'll be coming in
with me, after all.

340
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:50,958
What?!

341
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,416
Oh, and refusing
isn't an option...

342
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,375
See, if you don't
do as I say,

343
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,833
I'm afraid I'll have to
reconsider allowing Index

344
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,583
to remain with you any longer.

345
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,208
Necessarius is
content for now

346
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,375
to use you as
Index's shackles...

347
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,041
to ensure she doesn't
betray them...

348
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,208
However... if you won't obey,

349
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,541
then you're not
useful anymore.

350
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,250
You're crazy...

351
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,708
You expect me to follow
you blindly... really?

352
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,458
Do what you want.

353
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,000
The decision is yours.

354
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,166
Ah, we're home!

355
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,166
-Listen, Index...
-About earlier...

356
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,833
-I wanted to say...
-I just wanted...

357
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,416
Oh...

358
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,166
go ahead.

359
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,833
No... it's nothing.

360
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,375
So, uh...

361
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,458
what's with your stomach?

362
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,833
This...?

363
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,125
Maybe I ate too much.

364
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,333
It seems like you've gotten
bigger in another way, too...

365
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,541
If you know what I mean.

366
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,208
I am at that
point in life.

367
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,958
All right, young
lady, give it up.

368
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,083
What are you
hiding in there?

369
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,666
I... I'm not hiding
anything at all!

370
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,458
Really...! I swear by our
Father who art in Heaven.

371
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,000
On my honor as a sister,
I am not lying to you, Toma.

372
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,750
Wow, your religious
devotion runs deep, huh...?

373
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,250
Now get that dumb cat
out of here immediately!

374
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,541
Sphinxy!

375
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,208
Hey!

376
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,958
Back off... You
know perfectly well

377
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,750
that my robes are
a Walking Church.

378
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:37,875
So what if they are?

379
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,166
In the name of the Lord,

380
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,666
a church offers
salvation to sheep

381
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,416
who have been separated
from their flock.

382
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,833
And so... this church shall take
the cat Sphinx into its fold,

383
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,250
for he had been lost...

384
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,916
Amen.

385
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,875
Yeah... well, is that church
also gonna provide him

386
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,625
with food and kitty litter?

387
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,750
You just shut up...!

388
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,375
Sphinx is going to
stay here with us.

389
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,958
I don't care what you say!

390
00:17:59,041 --> 00:17:59,833
You can't just
decide that.

391
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,208
There are things
to consider!

392
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,708
I'll take care of
it all, you'll see!

393
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,166
Why... you little...!

394
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,958
Fine. I can see
I've lost this one.

395
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,291
Ah... Divine Father,
you are indeed merciful...

396
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,333
I give you thanks, for
the light of your grace

397
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,208
has finally touched
the soul of this savage,

398
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,583
unfeeling, cold-hearted boy.

399
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,625
Hey, now...

400
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,875
Oh... I almost forgot...

401
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,666
You were going to tell me
something, weren't you?

402
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,666
Oh... right, I was...

403
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,791
It's just... I left
my textbook somewhere

404
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,416
when we were out earlier.

405
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,583
I need to go look for it,

406
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,416
so will you keep
an eye on things?

407
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,416
Yep...

408
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,333
Sure will.

409
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,125
Sweet boy!

410
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,666
One more thing...

411
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,916
Keep the cat
in here, okay?

412
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,166
Uh-huh.

413
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,791
You're a good
kitty, Sphinx...

414
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,041
Yes you are!

415
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,416
What're you
doing with those?

416
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,458
I thought I'd leave her
with some protection.

417
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,708
Innocentius should
do the trick.

418
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,041
Who knows what could happen

419
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,833
while we're off on this
little errand of ours...?

420
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,041
If we're not careful, some
other sorcerers could show up

421
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,208
and try to take Index
away from here...

422
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,000
She can really
be a handful.

423
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,500
Do you... have a
thing for Index?

424
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,416
What?! Of all the
stupid things to ask...!

425
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,250
No...! She's just someone I like
to look out for, that's it...

426
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,500
She's my friend, of
course I care about her.

427
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,000
But not... like that.

428
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,708
Okay then.

429
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,291
I don't know how
I felt about Index

430
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,125
or what she was to me
before I lost my memory...

431
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,666
At this point,
I have no choice

432
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,875
but to keep trying my best
to act like who I was before.

433
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,250
It's almost like
there are two of me.

434
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,500
Yeah... that's some
rotten luck for you.

435
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,375
So this is Misawa Prep?

436
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,041
I gotta say... it doesn't
look too sinister.

437
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,500
It doesn't need to...

438
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,708
That isn't the point.

439
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,791
Hm?

440
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,166
It looks fine...

441
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,125
but the building itself
forms a powerful barrier

442
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,416
that was created
by the alchemist.

443
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,416
So, he's really strong... huh?

444
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,833
Aureolus Izzard
is quite strong...

445
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,458
He's descended from
the great Peraclesus...

446
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,541
I'm guessing you don't know
very much about alchemists,

447
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,333
though, do you?

448
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,541
Well, supposedly they
turn lead into gold...

449
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,375
and they brew
elixirs of immortality

450
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,666
and stuff, too, right?

451
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,041
Yeah, that about covers it....

452
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,500
except... for one more
important thing...

453
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,000
Throughout history,
alchemists have shared

454
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,000
one ultimate goal.

455
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,625
They all seek the power
to manipulate reality.

456
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,125
What's that mean?

457
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,541
Imagine if you
could take anything

458
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,833
you could dream up in your head,
anything at all,

459
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,166
and make it reality...

460
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,708
It's like that.

461
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,250
Huh...? Seriously...?

462
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,291
Anything I imagine
could become real...?

463
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,375
How could anyone hope
to fight against that?

464
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,208
Getting scared now...?

465
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,666
I bet you'd like to just wait
out here and keep watch.

466
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,166
That's too bad.
I need your help...

467
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,375
And in order to help,

468
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,791
you'll need to
know ahead of time

469
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,291
what Deep Blood looks like
so you'll recognize her...

470
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,833
Here. To be honest,

471
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,166
I don't have an especially
good memory for faces.

472
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,750
Her name is Aisa Himegami.

473
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,333
Or so I'm told.

474
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,416
You're kidding...

475
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,333
That's her?

476
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,750
All right...
It looks normal to me.

477
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:41,958
Of course it does...

478
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,166
Remember, on the surface

479
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,416
they're operating as a
college prep school.

480
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,958
Hey... look.

481
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,625
See that...?
What is it?

482
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,708
A robot...? Looks
like it's broken.

483
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:56,958
Well, we're here...

484
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,791
Let's not waste
any more time...

485
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,500
and it isn't a good idea
to stay in one location.

486
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,583
Oh...

487
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,708
I guess I can't blame
you for being curious.

488
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,625
You don't see
this too often.

489
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,083
I see robots all the time.

490
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,333
They're everywhere here.

491
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,250
What're you talking about?

492
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,458
That's no robot...

493
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,958
It's a corpse.

494
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:32,041
[Music]

495
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:59,458
The alchemist and his scheme
await us inside the school...

496
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:02,083
Also inside is
Aisa Himegami...

497
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,083
but what is her
true objective?

498
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,166
Next time, "Ars Magna."

499
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,833
When science and
magic cross paths,

500
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,291
a story is born.
