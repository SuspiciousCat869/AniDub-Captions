1
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,125
It's not fair.

2
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,791
I don't see why you should
have to go back to school today.

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,333
Hmm...? Oh, yeah.
I guess that means

4
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,875
you'll be here by
yourself all day.

5
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,166
What, you think
I'll be lonely?

6
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,375
You think I'm some
pathetic little girl

7
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,125
who's going to sit
here pining for you?

8
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,458
We'll sit down together
and figure something out soon.

9
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,833
But for today,
just stay here, okay?

10
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:03,625
Yeah, okay...

11
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,625
but you'll come
straight home?

12
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,000
Right after school...

13
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,041
and then... we'll find
something fun to do.

14
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,833
Sound good?

15
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,416
All right, then. I'm off.

16
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,375
I'll be waiting!

17
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,958
How should we entertain
ourselves Sphinxy?

18
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:37,291
Oh no...! We don't have
anything to eat for lunch.

19
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:42,583
What do I do...? This
is a crisis situation.

20
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:59,083
[Music]

21
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:09,083
[Music]

22
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:19,125
[Music]

23
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:29,125
[Music]

24
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:39,125
[Music]

25
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:49,125
[Music]

26
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:59,166
[Music]

27
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:09,166

28
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:19,166
[Music]

29
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:27,875
[Music]

30
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,666
Zapper looks like
she's in a hurry.

31
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,041
Good morning!

32
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,041
You've got a lot of
energy this early.

33
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,500
You on the other hand,
seem to have none at all.

34
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,958
I guess so...

35
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,750
A lot's been going on.
I'm kind of worn out.

36
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,541
Hey... what're
you saying...?

37
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,541
Was pretending to be my
boyfriend yesterday

38
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,458
that exhausting?

39
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,041
Well, it's not as if
that's the only thing

40
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,208
I've had on my plate lately.

41
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,000
Not the only thing...?!

42
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,583
You're doing the same
thing with someone else?

43
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,125
How many fake
girlfriends do you have?

44
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,083
Huh?

45
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,041
Please! You're the only
person who would ask me

46
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,875
to do something like that
without thinking twice!

47
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,375
You think asking you to
do that was easy for me?

48
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,875
Well. I'll have you know it
was a very difficult decision...

49
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,083
but I didn't have any
other choice at the time.

50
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,250
So I swallowed my pride
and did what I had to do

51
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,166
and that's all there
is to it, you got me?

52
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,083
Yeah, yeah, of course.
I'm sure you're right.

53
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,208
-Well, bye!
-Hey!

54
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,375
Did you actually
hear anything I said? !

55
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,541
Today's September 1st,
the beginning of second term.

56
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:30,166
Unfortunately, I lost my
memory over summer vacation.

57
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,000
So I feel every bit as
nervous as a new student

58
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,000
would on his first
day of school.

59
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,333
Was that Miss Komoe...?

60
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,625
Hold on...

61
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,541
her feet can't possibly
reach the brakes, right?

62
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,333
True, my feet don't reach
all the way to the pedals,

63
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,458
but I'm still perfectly
able to drive.

64
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,000
Now Kamijo, I hope all
that gawking a moment ago

65
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,958
wasn't because you
doubted my abilities.

66
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,250
Well, I, um...

67
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,458
Wait, is this a pop quiz?

68
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,166
I'm not being graded
on my answer, am I?

69
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,208
Aw, come on. I wouldn't
do that to you.

70
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,666
I like to wait until at
least second period

71
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,625
before giving pop quizzes.

72
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,375
Besides, I've been busy
collecting information.

73
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,041
A friend asked for some
data on AIM diffusion fields.

74
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,541
Never heard of that... AIM?

75
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,458
It stands for "An
Involuntary Movement."...

76
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,541
Basically, an
unmindful action.

77
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,708
The AIM diffusion fields
I was talking about

78
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,416
refer to the power
that espers emit,

79
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,250
kind of like body heat.

80
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,833
At least, in theory...

81
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:33,500
They're actually so slight
as to be immeasurable.

82
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,916
But if there
was an esper

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,791
who could read the
diffusion fields...

84
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,208
They'd be able to detect
any esper nearby...

85
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,666
Am I understanding
you right?

86
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,916
Is that what
you're saying?

87
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,833
Pretty much... And taking
it a step further,

88
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,750
that same esper could
even be able to tell

89
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,083
the type of ability
and how strong it is.

90
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,500
"Yes, this guy
has a battle power

91
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,208
of seventy thousand points."

92
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,500
Or, you know,
something like that...

93
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,041
..At any rate...

94
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,416
there are plenty of people
out there who would love

95
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,291
to have the ability to
detect nearby espers

96
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,666
and measure their power.

97
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,541
Thank you again...

98
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,875
I appreciate all the help.

99
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,416
All right... Tell me
what's goin' on...

100
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,083
Since when do we let
sorcerers sneak in this easily?

101
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,541
Calm yourself.

102
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,125
We are tracking the
intruders' whereabouts.

103
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,000
We should know
before long.

104
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,875
Sherry Cromwell...

105
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,541
She's not some
wandering sorcerer...

106
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,291
She's a member
of Necessarius.

107
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,375
If she's brought
down sloppily,

108
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,541
it'll cause a rift between
Necessarius and Academy City.

109
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,875
How sad to think
of neighbors

110
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,125
who love each other as we
do being so at odds...

111
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,166
Well, so you know,
I'm goin' after Sherry...

112
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,958
If another sorcerer
handles her takedown,

113
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,833
the waves it makes
won't be as big.

114
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,791
There's no need to
involve yourself.

115
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,625
You don't mean...

116
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,000
you're using Kamijo again? !

117
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,291
We'll condense plans
two-thousand eighty-two

118
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,125
through twenty-three-thousand-
seventy-seven.

119
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,541
The Imaginary Number
School District's

120
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,458
Five-Elemental
control method?

121
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,000
This runaway horse could
destroy the world

122
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,000
if we don't act now...

123
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,458
It's best if we take
hold of the reins again

124
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,833
as soon as possible.

125
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,625
Hey...

126
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,958
What's up, Kami?
Somethin' wrong?

127
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,291
-Where's Tsuchimikado?
-Huh...

128
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,916
Now that you mention it,
I haven't seen him today.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,375
Know what I think...?

130
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,875
He's somewhere still trying
to finish up his homework.

131
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,375
Yeah... I decided to
conveniently forget mine

132
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,791
so I can see Miss Komoe get
all worked up about it.

133
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,750
Oh, come on.

134
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,875
Okay...! Let's get
homeroom started, everyone.

135
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,500
Before the opening
ceremony begins,

136
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,625
I have some
big news to share!

137
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,041
We have a new
transfer student!

138
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,125
Everybody please join
me in welcoming her!

139
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,750
You heard right; the new
addition is a girl...

140
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,458
So congratulations,
gentlemen...

141
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,458
and better luck to you
next time, little ladies.

142
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,791
Introducing...

143
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,666
Our brand new
second-term student!

144
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,500
-What are you doing? !
-Oh good I found you...

145
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,458
So this is the school
you go to Toma.

146
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,250
I'm glad I picked
the right one!

147
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,750
Oh, dear! How did
you get in here?

148
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,291
You are most certainly not
the new transfer student!

149
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,583
Out you go now.
Out, out, out!

150
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,833
Oh my goodness...!
What were you thinking?

151
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,125
You can't just
march in here,

152
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,750
pretending to be a student!

153
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,166
Take this.

154
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,875
I want you to use that
to get yourself a taxi

155
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,833
and head straight home, okay?

156
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,250
Also, whatever you do, remember
not to talk to strangers,

157
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,916
even if they
offer you candy!

158
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,416
Just so you know...

159
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
I'm actually the
transfer student...

160
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,250
I'm Aisa Himegami.

161
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm going to faint
from hunger.

162
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,708
I've heard about these ...

163
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,750
I think they
give you tickets

164
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,666
that you can
exchange for food.

165
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,166
Toma makes fun of me for being
ignorant about technology...

166
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,166
but this should be
a piece of cake...

167
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,708
You just put
your money in...

168
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,125
And then you
press the button.

169
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,958
Hey, that's no fair...

170
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,666
There's no button!

171
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,375
Where'd the button go?

172
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,875
What do I do...?

173
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,208
That was all the money I had,
and the machine took it!

174
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,625
Excuse me...

175
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,166
It's simple...
just push the button.

176
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,208
But I don't see any
buttons anywhere on it!

177
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,375
It's a touch screen.

178
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,916
You just have to
press on the monitor.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Well that doesn't
make sense.

180
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,625
You can't touch
the people in the TV.

181
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:29,750
"Cancel"

182
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,125
Amazing! Do they make
TVs that do that, too?

183
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,541
Not really. Sorry.

184
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,458
Thanks so much...!
What's your name?

185
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,291
You're nice!

186
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,750
Oh, thanks...
I'm Hyoka Kazakiri.

187
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,583
So then, after I
entered the classroom,

188
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,916
I called out Toma's name.

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,291
Not only did
he not answer,

190
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,291
the jerk even looked
away from me!

191
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,291
Hmm. I can see how that
would be frustrating,

192
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,833
but only students and teachers
are allowed in the school.

193
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,750
What about you, Hyoka?
You're here.

194
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,166
Oh, I'm here because...

195
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,625
I'm a transfer student.

196
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,291
Okay, then I'll be a
transfer student, too!

197
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,833
About that...

198
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,916
I didn't come here to just
turn around and leave.

199
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,625
I'm not going until
Toma tells me

200
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,333
what I'm supposed
to do about lunch!

201
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,125
Okay... but in that outfit,

202
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,708
you're going to call
attention to yourself.

203
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,958
All right. So what do you
think I should do, then?

204
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,708
Well, um...

205
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,458
I might have one idea...

206
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,166
Come over here a second.

207
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,416
It never ceases
to amaze me.

208
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,375
How can one person get into so
much trouble so frequently?

209
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,916
She's got a real
knack for it.

210
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,500
It stretches well, see...?

211
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:35,083
And the fabric washes
clean really easily. Amazing!

212
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,083
This is something people
would call "high-tech," right?

213
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,500
I know that voice...

214
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,125
You little idiot!

215
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,250
Hey, Index, you brat!

216
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,958
Just what do you think
you're doing in... here...

217
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,458
uh...

218
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,000
M... my mistake. So sorry.

219
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,916
Toma!!

220
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,208
Today's just the
opening ceremony.

221
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,958
I'll be done by
noon at the latest.

222
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,791
Oh, really? And how do
you know that, exactly?

223
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,291
Because everyone
knows that.

224
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,875
If you know so much,
Toma, then answer me this.

225
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,250
When performing the
ceremony to create

226
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,416
a Telesmatic Image
to be used as an idol

227
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,000
for the English
Church of the Cross,

228
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,125
what role is played
by the direction

229
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,708
and the position
of the caster?

230
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,250
If the calculation's off
by even a little bit,

231
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,625
the spell won't take effect...

232
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,375
but of course you know
the answer, don't you?

233
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,583
After all,
that's how it is.

234
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,416
Everyone knows that.

235
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,791
So, Index, I'm curious...

236
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,166
Who's this girl?

237
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,791
Actually, I don't really know.
But she's my friend.

238
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,375
Yet, you don't
know who she is?

239
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah, so? That doesn't mean
she can't be my friend.

240
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,791
Um, it's nice to meet you.
My name is Hyoka Kazakiri.

241
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,791
Hello. I'm Toma Kamijo.
You're a new student?

242
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,041
Yes... That's right.

243
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,583
That's enough! You're
making Hyoka nervous,

244
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,333
and I won't stand for it!

245
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,125
Don't worry
about him, Hyoka...

246
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,375
Toma may be a hormonally
super-charged teenage boy

247
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,666
who involves himself with
one girl after another...

248
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,166
but he's still a
basically decent guy.

249
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,375
You can hold Sphinx if that'll
make you feel better...

250
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,583
Petting a kitty reduces stress
and lowers blood pressure.

251
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,083
His name is Sphinx?

252
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,458
He's really cute.

253
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,000
I wonder what's wrong.

254
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,458
Animals' senses are
significantly sharper

255
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,833
than humans' are.

256
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,375
Maybe the difference
in our smells

257
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,833
is what's upsetting him.

258
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,208
Kamijo!

259
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,333
The first day
of second term,

260
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,791
and you're already--

261
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,166
Miss Komoe? Shouldn't you be
at the opening ceremony?

262
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,875
I had to come
looking for you.

263
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,375
You're supposed to be
in the gymnasium

264
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,583
with all the other students,
as you know full well...

265
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,333
but here you are
in the cafeteria!

266
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,958
Well, here's the thing...

267
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,541
How is it that you
always have girls

268
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,500
falling into your
lap, Kamijo?

269
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,875
Are you producing some
strange AIM diffusion field?

270
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,208
Why would you
assume that...?

271
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,041
Hey... Kazakiri, could you
please explain why...

272
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,791
Huh?

273
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,875
Did she cut and run
on the first day?

274
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,833
Hey.

275
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,875
Hyoka!

276
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,458
That was quite a
scene back there.

277
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,291
I mean, it... kinda
surprised me.

278
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,375
Komoe wasn't mad
at us or anything.

279
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,166
So there's nothing
to worry about.

280
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,083
If that's true, then why
do you look so sad, Index?

281
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,875
Toma was mad at me.

282
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,750
He wasn't even willing to
listen to what I had to say...

283
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,458
He didn't so much
as smile at me.

284
00:13:56,416 --> 00:14:00,375
What if... What if Toma
doesn't like me anymore?

285
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,166
Now I can tell you
not to worry...

286
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,375
If you can argue like that,
it means you're close.

287
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,000
How's that?

288
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,500
Good friends can argue
with each other

289
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,833
because they know
they'll always be able

290
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,416
to make up afterwards.

291
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,041
I think that's why
he felt comfortable

292
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,291
arguing with you...

293
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,583
because he knows
you're inseparable.

294
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,208
Really? You mean it?

295
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,750
He cares enough
to get mad at you,

296
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,916
and that says a lot
about his feelings.

297
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm sure it'll
all blow over.

298
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,833
Though I have to wonder how
he was able to talk to us

299
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,500
with a straight face
after seeing us undressed.

300
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,000
Hey!

301
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,166
Toma!

302
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,166
Well, I'm done. Wanna
go grab some food?

303
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,125
So we're not just eating
lunch at home today?

304
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,750
I promised we'd find
something fun to do.

305
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,708
Wanna come, Kazakiri?

306
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,458
Please, Hyoka! I'd love
it if you'd join us!

307
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,583
Are you sure?

308
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,750
Of course! Let's go!

309
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,208
Well, okay.

310
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,041
Sounds like fun.

311
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,166
Oh... Well...

312
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,750
I should take out
some money first.

313
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,458
Oh, Himegami.

314
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,041
Didn't you notice that I just
transferred to your school...?

315
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,541
I didn't get a
very warm welcome.

316
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,791
Well, this is great...

317
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:20,750
I guess I'm one
of those girls

318
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,208
who's easy to overlook then.

319
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,250
Uh, no, not at all...
Oh, I know!

320
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,833
We were just about to
grab something to eat...

321
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:26,916
Wanna come with?

322
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,708
Perfect Komoe... Thank you.

323
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,125
-Huh?
-Nothing. Never mind...

324
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,416
I've got an errand to run,

325
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,875
so I can't hang out
with you now...

326
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,416
but I am curious.

327
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,000
Who is that?

328
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,041
Her name's Hyoka Kazakiri...
She's new.

329
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,166
Hyoka Kazakiri.
Are you sure that's her?

330
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,416
Pretty sure...

331
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,083
That's what she and
Index both say, anyway...

332
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,333
Do you know her?

333
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,875
Kirigaoka Girls' School.

334
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,666
It's the high school I went to
before that prep school...

335
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,958
I saw the name
Hyoka Kazakiri

336
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,333
while I was there, too.

337
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,500
If you went to
the same school,

338
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,083
does that mean she
has some rare ability,

339
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,000
like your Deep Blood?

340
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,500
I couldn't say.

341
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,333
Her name was always posted
at the top of the test rankings,

342
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,333
but no one had ever
actually seen her...

343
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,916
It was almost like she
was a ghost or something.

344
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,875
Nobody even knew what class
she was supposed to be in.

345
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,333
What's up with that?

346
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,208
I decided to check
out the anomaly...

347
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,916
That's how I found
her secret...

348
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,541
The girl named
Hyoka Kazakiri

349
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,458
is also known as
Counter Stop.

350
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,833
And that's not even the most
important thing I discovered.

351
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,875
Kazakiri is the key
to learning about

352
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,375
the Imaginary Number School
District's Five-Element Agency.

353
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,750
You mean it exists...?

354
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,375
The Five Element
Agency is real?

355
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,166
Word is they control
the administration

356
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,166
of Academy City
from the shadows.

357
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,125
It appears that she was
in a class by herself

358
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,708
designed to investigate
her own unique ability.

359
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,291
It's said to be part
of a lab set up to find

360
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,875
the true nature of the Imaginary
Number School District.

361
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,041
I don't understand why
she would be here though.

362
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,291
According to her,
she transferred in.

363
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,833
But I'm supposed to be
the only transfer student.

364
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:04,875
Be careful around her.

365
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,916
So this is the underground
world I've heard so much about.

366
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
-It's amazing!
-It's a mall.

367
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,541
An underground mall.

368
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,625
Well, Index, is there any
place in particular

369
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,166
you wanted to grab lunch...?

370
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,208
Anywhere too expensive or
with too long a line is out.

371
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,083
All that matters is
that the food is yummy.

372
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,458
It can be a cheapo
hole-in-the-wall for all I care!

373
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,291
Sounds good...
That okay with you?

374
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,208
You look frightened.
Was it something I said?

375
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh... no...

376
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,041
It's not that I'm scared
of you or anything.

377
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,791
But you've seen me
practically naked.

378
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,083
Forget about it!

379
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,208
So, this student of
yours is having

380
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:56,666
a secret rendezvous with
a mysterious girl?

381
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,958
Man, I'm jealous of you.

382
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,000
My honor students would
never do something

383
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,875
as deliciously salacious.

384
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,500
Honestly...!I'm trying to tell
you about a possible threat,

385
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,750
and you're
laughing at me? !

386
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,791
This girl could
be the intruder.

387
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,291
What if she's
someone dangerous?

388
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,416
Are you prepared for that?

389
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,916
Oh, calm down...

390
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,500
Anyway, my current
information is that

391
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,750
there are actually two
intruders here in the city.

392
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,791
And that's what I'm trying
to verify right now.

393
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,875
How can we be certain...

394
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,458
there are only
two of them?

395
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,541
Yes, Yomikawa here...

396
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll be right there.

397
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,916
Was that Antiskill
calling you in?

398
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,791
Looks like I've got some
serious work to do...

399
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,333
I'll have to
cut this short...

400
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,833
See ya later.

401
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,625
I brought the book you
asked me to locate for you.

402
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,083
Perfect... Good work, Himegami.

403
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,458
May I ask you something?

404
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,166
Yes?

405
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,625
Is there a student
enrolled in this school

406
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,750
who goes by the
name Hyoka Kazakiri?

407
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,125
I've got you now.

408
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,333
-An evacuation order!
-Run!

409
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,041
I'll have to ask you to remain
right where you are, please.

410
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,500
I'm Kuroko Shirai,
with Judgment,

411
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,125
the organization charged
with maintaining

412
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,125
the safety of Academy
City and its citizens.

413
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,291
I think you know why
you're being apprehended,

414
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,333
but I'd be happy to
explain if you need me to.

415
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,500
Search temporarily
suspended.

416
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,875
Get out of my
way, little girl.

417
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,916
Maybe I need to make your
situation a little clearer.

418
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,083
There we go...

419
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,875
Do you understand what
I'm saying better now?

420
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,041
What's happening? !

421
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,958
She's an outsider...!
How can she be an esper?

422
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,916
This isn't good... I need
to figure something out.

423
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,708
I don't know what all
this commotion is about.

424
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,541
But nobody messes with
a friend of mine

425
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,625
and gets away with it!

426
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,458
You should be
all right now.

427
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,958
Looks like that giant
mud guy was just a decoy.

428
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,666
So were you taking
her in for Judgment?

429
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,250
Yes, we were instructed
to apprehend her

430
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,791
for criminal trespassing.

431
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,333
You saved me...

432
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,708
You saved me, Sissy!

433
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:58,833
Ah, geez.

434
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,333
Good grief.

435
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,208
Hey...

436
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,541
Kuroko...

437
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,458
You know you can count
on me whenever, right?

438
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,958
I don't want you to think
you're putting me out

439
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,333
by asking for help.

440
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,916
Sissy, you really must
love me to hold me like this

441
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,333
and allow me
to burrow my face

442
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,333
deep into the valley
of your breasts!

443
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,875
Let go already, Kuroko!

444
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,750
This isn't what I
meant by helping you!

445
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,083
This most fundamental
and crucial knowledge

446
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:30,083
was widespread in the
days before Noah's Ark.

447
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,666
Even now, it is still
being disseminated

448
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,833
in fragments by
the chief Grigori,

449
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,375
though in a different manner.

450
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,458
In the beginning,
there was nothing

451
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,125
but the primordial earth...

452
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,166
Then God gave form
to the planet's dust,

453
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,208
breathed life into it,
and named it man.

454
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,083
In time, this sacred
process was revealed

455
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,750
to man by beings who
had fallen to the earth.

456
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,916
However, it was not a work
that could be undertaken

457
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,166
by the hands of mortals.

458
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,875
And so the life that
I brought forth

459
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,291
from the dust was only
a pale imitation.

460
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,791
A mere shadow of the being
I had sought to create.

461
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,958
The malformed
Golem Ellis...

462
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,041
Working tirelessly,
endlessly by my side.

463
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,583
Try not to keep me
waiting too long...

464
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,166
Ellis.

465
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:40,208
[Music]

466
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,291
The sorceress
Sherry Cromwell

467
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,125
calls forth the
monster Ellis...

468
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,583
We find ourselves
trapped underground,

469
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,041
caught up in a fierce battle.

470
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,125
Kazakiri, what
is your secret?

471
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,708
Next time, "Golem."

472
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:09,750
When science and magic cross
paths, a story is born.
