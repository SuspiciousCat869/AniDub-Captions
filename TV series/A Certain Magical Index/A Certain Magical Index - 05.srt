1
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,250
Index's perfect memory
comes with a drawback...

2
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:37,166
85% of her brain is
taken up by the grimoires,

3
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,125
which leaves only 15%
for other functions...

4
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,708
The sorcerers say
that because of this,

5
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,875
they have to erase her memory
every year or she will die...

6
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:47,833
Only three days remain until
they perform the ceremony.

7
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,583
Wait... there were
three days...

8
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,208
I've been asleep how long?

9
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:59,000
[Music]

10
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,250
Okay, Kamijo, I'm
heading out now...

11
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,458
I won't be back until late,

12
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,750
so you're in charge...

13
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,666
Be a good boy and
keep an eye on things here

14
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,708
for me, all right?

15
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,166
But I ask one thing:

16
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,208
I don't want you
hurting Toma anymore!

17
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,166
The limit will be
reached in twelve hours

18
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,291
and thirty-eight minutes.

19
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,416
We wanted to see
if the ball and chain

20
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,875
was sufficient to keep you
from running away again...

21
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,541
It worked better
than we thought.

22
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,958
The ball and chain?

23
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,541
You don't want your little
toy taken away, do you...?

24
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,333
If not, you'd best abandon
any thoughts of running...

25
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,333
Understood?

26
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,541
It'll be all right.

27
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,666
I can work out a
deal with them...

28
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,750
and your life can go back to
how it was before you met me.

29
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,208
I promise...

30
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,333
I'm not going to let them
bother you anymore...

31
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,583
I...

32
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,958
Index, what happened?

33
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,041
I'll make this quick.

34
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,791
Hello...? Can you hear me?

35
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,375
Yeah... Kanzaki, wasn't it?

36
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,208
It doesn't matter....

37
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,625
There's no need for
pleasantries now......

38
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,625
is Index there with you?

39
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,708
I'd rather not
wake her up.

40
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:42,875
No, that's perfect...

41
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,833
Just listen to
what I have to say.

42
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,250
It's almost time...

43
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,166
She'll reach her limit
tonight at midnight.

44
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,916
At that exact hour,
we'll begin the ceremony

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,916
to erase her memories...

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,791
The one that will
save her life.

47
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,708
Why would you go out of your
way to tell me your plans?

48
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,375
Knowing what to expect is
only gonna make it

49
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,875
that much easier
for me to fight you.

50
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,625
Don't you want the opportunity
to say goodbye to her?

51
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,333
This is not a matter
open for debate

52
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,625
or negotiation...

53
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,958
This is an order...

54
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,000
You will say your farewells
before we arrive...

55
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,750
And then you will
leave that place.

56
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,291
Do you understand me?

57
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,125
You people are
unbelievable...

58
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,875
Index is paying the price
for your incompetence...

59
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,333
I thought you
guys knew sorcery.

60
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,291
Can't you do anything with
your magic to help her? !

61
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,875
She's got a hundred and three
thousand books in her head!

62
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,875
Maybe one of those
has the answer!

63
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,541
The church
can't allow that.

64
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,791
Index turning on them
is their greatest fear.

65
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,375
What are you
talking about?

66
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,750
The grimoires are full of
dangerous information...

67
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,708
The church decreed that
Index would not be allowed

68
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,250
access to anything in them

69
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,541
that dealt with
memory manipulation.

70
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,875
Fine... then why not try to get
to them with your own magic?

71
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,333
The church is also very
concerned about sorcerers

72
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,333
outside of Necessarius
gaining access to the books.

73
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,041
Take my word for it;

74
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,958
the grimoires are
very well protected.

75
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,541
And then, of course,
there's the fact

76
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,583
that the act of reading the
grimoires defiles the mind.

77
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,750
You knew that... and you still
let Index memorize them? !

78
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,916
We weren't told until
it was already done...

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,500
Our magic cannot help her.

80
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,875
Trust me.

81
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,291
All right then...

82
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,625
but what about us?

83
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:19,875
What do you mean?

84
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,458
I'm talking
about science...

85
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,291
I bet there are any
number of ways to erase

86
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,625
someone's memory
by using science.

87
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,125
You've said magic can't be
used to get to those books,

88
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,958
but maybe there's
something else that can...

89
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,166
This is Academy
City, remember...

90
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,833
There are plenty
of espers here

91
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,791
who know about
manipulating the mind...

92
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,833
I say it's still too
soon to abandon all hope.

93
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,458
But maybe you'd rather
go for the quick fix

94
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,000
you know will work instead
of taking on a challenge...

95
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,416
Never mind that it's
your supposed friend's

96
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
happiness we're
talking about here.

97
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,916
Talk is cheap...

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,833
Results are what
we're interested in.

99
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,416
And, to use your words,

100
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,541
we do indeed know
that our "quick fix"

101
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,208
will have the desired
result of saving her life.

102
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,416
We can't be certain
something else would work

103
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,708
so any other method
would be a gamble....

104
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,625
It isn't a matter of not
wanting to take on a challenge.

105
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,916
We don't want to be reckless
with somebody else's life.

106
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,000
In that case...

107
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,458
I don't think we'll ever
see eye-to-eye on this...

108
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,875
No surprise there.

109
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,250
But you should know...

110
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,583
I'm still gonna
fight you...

111
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,875
no matter what!

112
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,291
You should stay
out of my way...

113
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,750
I don't care what I do to
you if it means saving her.

114
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,250
If anything happens to her
while she's in your care,

115
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,375
you can consider
your life forfeit...

116
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,583
I will see you at
midnight tonight...

117
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,291
You only have a short
time remaining now.

118
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,000
If you want to spend it
fighting a losing battle,

119
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,291
it's up to you.

120
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,125
Let's see...

121
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,333
"Memory loss is commonly
caused by old age

122
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,625
or over consumption
of alcohol ...

123
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,791
It may also occur
following an interruption

124
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,125
of blood flow to
the brain."

125
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,750
"Drug induced:

126
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,166
Certain medicines may
also cause memory loss...

127
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,083
Among these are general
anesthetics such as

128
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,541
halothane as well as
some benzodiazepines."

129
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,000
Forget it. This isn't
getting me anywhere.

130
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,291
What is that?

131
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,916
Miss Komoe's cell
phone statement.

132
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,583
That might work!

133
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,250
I'll ask Miss Komoe if
she knows the number

134
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,875
to any research lab that
might deal with neurology.

135
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,250
Oh, come on...
Pick up the phone!

136
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,250
I guess all I can do now
is call up some places

137
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,916
at random and hope. "...

138
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,791
Next up.

139
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,708
Damn it!

140
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,750
Hi... is someone there?

141
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,083
Research on
photographic memory?

142
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,166
Yes... I'm familiar with it.

143
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,250
What's the problem?

144
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,000
Can you describe the
issue in detail for me?

145
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,541
Magic...? Seriously?

146
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,833
What do you think
you're doing

147
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,583
making a prank call
at this hour?

148
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,958
It's nearly midnight.

149
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,458
Hello...?.. Are
you still there?

150
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:02,916
Hello...?

151
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,625
Oh, for crying out loud!

152
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,000
We've run out of time.

153
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,500
Move it.

154
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,208
We'll refer to the
Book of Crowley...

155
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,916
We need to call
down an angel...

156
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,625
and raise a temple
in this room.

157
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,583
We need to root out
every last memory.

158
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,208
Wait... just hold on...

159
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,375
Think about it!

160
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,333
There are over
1.8 million espers

161
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,041
here in Academy City...

162
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,500
and more than a
thousand research labs.

163
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,375
If we check out
those possibilities,

164
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,125
we might not have to resort
to something so drastic.

165
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,041
You guys don't want this to
happen to her either, right...?

166
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,541
Deep down you're
hoping and praying

167
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,583
that there's some other
way, aren't you?

168
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,166
So it's simple ...

169
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,625
just wait a
little longer...

170
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,541
I promise... I'll
find another way...

171
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,125
Whatever it takes,

172
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,083
I'll find something that
works for everybody.

173
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,666
Are you done talking,
or is there more?

174
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,375
Look! If she wasn't
unconscious now,

175
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,166
would you be saying
the same thing...?

176
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,458
She's endured this
hell for so long...

177
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,958
She's in so much pain she
can't open her eyes,

178
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,541
and you'd tell
her: "Sit tight,

179
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,375
there's something
I wanna try."

180
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,291
You'd have doctors
you never met before

181
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,791
poking around in her body,

182
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,416
pumping her full of drugs...

183
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,208
all on the off chance
that maybe it'll work? !

184
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,416
What kind of a
person are you?

185
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,875
Answer me...!

186
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,000
Are you truly
a human being,

187
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,875
or a monster who's
wearing human skin?

188
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,375
Do you see this...?

189
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,625
It's a magical artifact

190
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,083
necessary for erasing
her memories.

191
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,208
All you have to do is touch
it with your right hand,

192
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,791
and it will lose
all its power.

193
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,541
The only thing that
we'll be taking from Index

194
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,875
is her memory...

195
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,833
a small price to pay...
but you...

196
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,500
if whatever you want
to attempt fails,

197
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,208
you'll be taking
away her life.

198
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,083
Knowing that...

199
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,375
do you still wanna try?

200
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,541
Can you sit here, watching
her struggle bravely,

201
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,791
and decide to risk her life?

202
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,208
If you're so sure
it's going to work,

203
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,833
why do you hesitate...?

204
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,291
Go ahead and
play the hero!

205
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,125
I'm Index. Nice
to meet you!

206
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,625
Do you have
any food in there?

207
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,833
I'm really starving...

208
00:12:58,916 --> 00:12:59,958
Please feed me!

209
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,458
The ceremony will
commence at 12:15 a.m.

210
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:10,166
We'll use the power of Leo
to perform the memory erasure.

211
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,291
All right.

212
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,125
Hey... sorcerer guy...

213
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,750
What am I supposed
to say to her

214
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,916
when I... when I
tell her goodbye?

215
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,791
If you hadn't
noticed, I'm busy.

216
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,541
I don't have time
to give you advice...

217
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,083
What you need to do
right now is shut up...

218
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,791
and get out of here.

219
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,208
Your right hand
extinguished my flames...

220
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,916
I still can't comprehend
the principles at work there,

221
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,541
but I don't want it
to have any influence

222
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,958
on the ceremony
we're about to perform,

223
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,250
no matter how
minor it may be.

224
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,375
Useless...

225
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,291
I'm useless...

226
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,166
What good am I if I can't
even save this one girl

227
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,166
from suffering
such a huge loss?

228
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,625
There is still
enough time left...

229
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,666
We have ten minutes
before we need to begin.

230
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,541
Do you remember what
it was like for us

231
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,083
the first time we had to
erase her memories?

232
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,083
We spent the whole night
by her side, sobbing.

233
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,166
No... no way...

234
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,625
Who knows what that kid
might try to pull

235
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,916
if we leave him here?

236
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,875
If we take our eyes off
him for a second,

237
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,500
he could do something
that kills them both!

238
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,083
If that were really true,
wouldn't he have touched

239
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,958
the cross when you gave
him the opportunity?

240
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,000
You only gave
him that test

241
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,791
because you knew
he would pass...

242
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,416
You knew he wouldn't
risk her life.

243
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,375
Yeah, maybe...

244
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,500
Either way, we cannot
perform the ceremony

245
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,333
until the time is right...

246
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,583
It's riskier to deny
him his goodbye...

247
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,125
Without that closure, he
might change his mind

248
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,500
and interrupt us at a
crucial moment...

249
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,750
Just let him.

250
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,583
Just ten minutes... Understood?

251
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:09,000
To... ma...?

252
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,166
Index...

253
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,500
I'm sorry.

254
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,166
Toma...

255
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,500
Some kind of array has
been set up in the room.

256
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,666
They said it was
recovery magic.

257
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,291
Recovery magic?

258
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,458
Who said that?

259
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,000
Those sorcerers
came back, didn't they?

260
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,458
Go now! You have
to get out of here!

261
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,875
No... it's fine...

262
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,166
I'm staying.

263
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,958
-Toma!
-It's all done...

264
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,541
It's over.

265
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,500
For now, at
least, it's over.

266
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,041
Toma...

267
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,500
I'm sorry...

268
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,041
I'll get stronger, and this
will never happen again...

269
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,750
I'll punish every
single person

270
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,541
who is responsible for
doing this to you...

271
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,083
When I'm done with them,

272
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,333
they'll regret this
more than anything else

273
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,833
they've ever done
in their lives.

274
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,250
Just you wait...

275
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,375
Next time, I swear
I'll save you...

276
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,416
Next time I
will not fail...

277
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
no matter what
I have to do.

278
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,291
Thank you, Toma...

279
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,375
I'll be waiting.

280
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,708
Damn it.

281
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,250
Is this really the
way it has to end?

282
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,583
It's not fair...

283
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,916
There must've been something
else I could've done...

284
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,625
Something to get to
those damn books

285
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:32,166
that are taking up 85%
of Index's brain.

286
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,000
Something to save the memories
she does have left...

287
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,000
She should get to control more
than a sliver of her own brain.

288
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,000
Wait...

289
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,250
A full 85% of Index's
brain is used to store

290
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,333
the hundred and three
thousand grimoires...

291
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,583
As a result, she has only
15% of her brain remaining

292
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,333
to control
day-to-day functions.

293
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,041
Index's memory
erasure is conducted

294
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,916
at precise yearly
intervals.

295
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,125
Hang on a second...

296
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,125
How is it that only a
year's worth of memories

297
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,958
can fit into that
leftover fifteen percent?

298
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,000
And another thing...

299
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,583
how did they arrive at those
figures in the first place...?

300
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,375
They seem like
arbitrary percentages,

301
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,291
not precise calculations.

302
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:16,833
Yes? Oh, hi Kamijo.

303
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,291
I recognized your voice.

304
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,875
What are you doing
using my phone

305
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,333
without asking
permission first?

306
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,791
Huh? ... What's that about
photographic memory...?

307
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,416
Yeah... it exists...

308
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,750
It's a rare ability that
very few people have...

309
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,083
Was there something specific

310
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,708
you want to know about it?

311
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,500
Someone told me a year's
worth of memories

312
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,333
take up fifteen percent of
a person's brain capacity...

313
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,833
but if that's true...

314
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,208
what about people who have
photographic memories...?

315
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,875
Wouldn't their brains
become overloaded

316
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,541
around the time
they're seven years old?

317
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,625
It's true that somebody
with a photographic memory

318
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,291
is unable to
forget anything.

319
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,416
The memories are permanent,

320
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,083
no matter how
trivial they are...

321
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,375
but even so it's impossible
for someone's memories

322
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,041
to overload their brain.

323
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,166
In fact, some studies
indicate that the human brain

324
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,375
is able to store up to

325
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,500
a hundred and forty
years of memories.

326
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,291
It's impossible for memories
to overload the human brain?

327
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,541
Human memory is
really complex.

328
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,583
There's more than
one kind, you know.

329
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,833
There's semantic memory,

330
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,833
which handles language
and knowledge...

331
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,500
Procedural memory, which
handles motor skills

332
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,500
that are acquired
over time...

333
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,916
and episodic memory, which
handles memories of past events.

334
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,458
Kinda nifty the way it's
all split up like that, huh?

335
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,375
Oh, yeah. Very nifty...

336
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,541
So, Miss Komoe, what
exactly are you telling me?

337
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,041
I'll sum it up for you...

338
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,375
It doesn't matter how much
knowledge you acquire...

339
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,875
Neurologically speaking,
there is absolutely no way

340
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,583
that your memories could
make your brain explode

341
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,250
or anything close to it.

342
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,750
According to what
Miss Komoe says

343
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,333
Index's photographic memory

344
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,291
isn't actually a
life-threatening condition.

345
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,791
If that's the case...

346
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,791
it has to mean the church
is lying to Kanzaki.

347
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,083
But there's no question
that Index is suffering.

348
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,875
The church must have tampered
with her brain somehow...

349
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,125
They rigged it
so if her memories

350
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,958
aren't erased on a
yearly basis, she'll die.

351
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,875
They need to
ensure that Index,

352
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,750
the keeper of the
grimoire library,

353
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,750
will never turn
against them.

354
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,875
And Index's friends, too.

355
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:17,875
The church needs
to make sure

356
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,333
they'll do what
they're told.

357
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,958
All right...

358
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,916
So what exactly did they
do to make her this way?

359
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,916
If you're so sure
it's going to work,

360
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,500
why do you hesitate...?

361
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,083
Go ahead
and play the hero!

362
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:35,958
I won't play the hero.

363
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,041
I will be the hero!

364
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:06,958
Okay...

365
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,375
let's see...

366
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,041
There doesn't seem to
be any change yet...

367
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,583
so I haven't come in
contact with any magic...

368
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,791
All right, maybe...

369
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,500
they put it someplace
I haven't touched yet?

370
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,458
No, they wouldn't...

371
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,291
Urgent Warning...

372
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,666
Read from
Chapter 3, Verse 2.

373
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,541
A rupture has been
detected in all barriers,

374
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,541
from one through three.

375
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,500
Regeneration
provisions failing...

376
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,833
Auto-regeneration
not possible.

377
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,208
Action required to
preserve the library.

378
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,250
Assigning priority to
interception of the intruder.

379
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,916
Currently reverse-calculating
the magic formula

380
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,291
that has penetrated the barriers
by accessing the library.

381
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,291
Failure... Unable to
locate relevant magic.

382
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,166
Breaking down formula
composition to develop

383
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,750
a local weapon that
will counter the intruder.

384
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,541
Locating most
effective magic...

385
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,250
Desired combination
for intruder repulsion

386
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,500
has been successfully
acquired.

387
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,333
Now deploying
specified magic...

388
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,000
Employing Saint George's
Holy Sanctuary...

389
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,875
The intruder
will be destroyed.

390
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:36,291
[Music]

391
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:50,791
[Music]

392
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,291
Saint George's
Holy Sanctuary creates

393
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:01,000
a seemingly endless distance
between Index and me...

394
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,625
but I'm just
one step away...

395
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,583
One more step and
I know I'll reach her!

396
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,458
Next time,
"Imagine Breaker."

397
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:08,208
When science and
magic cross paths...

398
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,708
a story is born.
