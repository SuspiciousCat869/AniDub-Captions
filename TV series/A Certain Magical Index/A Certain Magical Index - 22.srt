1
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,958
September 1st marked the end
of a turbulent summer vacation.

2
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,750
It turns out our new
transfer student is Index...

3
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,583
wait, no... it's Himegami.

4
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,000
I took Index
and her new friend,

5
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,375
a girl named Hyoka Kazakiri

6
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,666
to have some lunch at
the underground mall.

7
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,291
We probably
wouldn't have gone

8
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,958
if we had known what was going
to happen while we were there.

9
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:56,958
[Music]

10
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,291
Thank you, have a good day.

11
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,708
Ah, that was officially
a delicious meal...

12
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,458
Now my tummy feels full,
full, full, full, full!

13
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,500
What's all this...?

14
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,583
It looks like a whole
bunch of television sets.

15
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,291
How cool...! I've never
seen a TV like this before!

16
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,958
Um, Index...

17
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,958
So you know, that
isn't actually a TV.

18
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,250
My phone...

19
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,750
Who is it...?

20
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,250
I'll catch up in a sec, okay?

21
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,750
C'mon, Hyoka, let's go!

22
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,375
Yes, hello?

23
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,041
It's... gami...

24
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,458
careful... Ka... iri...

25
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,583
Hey, wait...

26
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,208
Well. We're underground... so...

27
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,958
Oh, wow...!
These are adorable!

28
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,416
So cute, so cute,
so cute...!

29
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,625
Look, Hyoka...!

30
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,333
Aren't these little
things darling?

31
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,625
Oh... yeah!

32
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,250
Hey... look over there!

33
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,916
I love how many costumes
they had to choose from...

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,208
It's an impressive
selection.

35
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,958
Yeah... That maid costume
was totally cute too!

36
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,583
Index... Right there.

37
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,958
I think you choose from one
of the costumes they have.

38
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,333
And then you can get
your picture taken

39
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,916
in one of those
photo booths.

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,791
Oh, wow...! That sounds
like a lot of fun!

41
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:00,875
Come on, let's try it!

42
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,166
Um, I don't know
about this...

43
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,666
Hello, Index...?
Where are you guys?

44
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,666
This is amazing!

45
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,000
Look at this...

46
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,458
They even have a Magical
Powered Kanamin costume!

47
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,125
Um... are you really
going to wear that?

48
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
Yep, I sure am!

49
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,125
In here, huh?

50
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,625
Hey, Index,
are you in there?

51
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,625
Yikes...! T-T-Toma!

52
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,208
Uh, please wait there.

53
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,541
Don't open the
curtain right now.

54
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,166
Right... I'm not gonna make
the same mistake I made earlier.

55
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,833
That was embarrassing
for everyone.

56
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,083
Hey... Take it easy...

57
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,166
No pushing.

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,833
So cool...

59
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,208
Here, we can
split them up...

60
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,750
This can be your half.

61
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,041
Thanks.

62
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,416
So this is what it's like
to be a student here, huh...?

63
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,000
You guys have it made!

64
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,250
Yeah, except for all the boring
classes and hellish tests...

65
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,750
Oh, and then there's the
mountains and mountains

66
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,666
of homework you have to do.

67
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,500
What's that?

68
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,708
Did you hear it?

69
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,041
Yeah.

70
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,041
What's up you guys...?

71
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,291
Is something the matter?

72
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,500
I heard a voice from
somewhere just now.

73
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,000
-A voice?
-Yeah...

74
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,708
It almost felt like it was
talking directly inside my head.

75
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,625
A voice inside your head...?

76
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,166
-That's kind of...
-You, there! Move it!

77
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,583
How much more warning
do you three need...?

78
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,750
I can't believe you're
just standing there.

79
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,333
What's Judgment doing here?

80
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,333
Um... Something wrong?

81
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,583
Oh, brother...

82
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,791
Listen to the telepathic
warning, you idiots...

83
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:33,916
I'll give you
one more chance.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,833
Here.

85
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:43,750
You get that...?

86
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,583
Understand the situation now?

87
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,750
Nope... not at all.

88
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,541
This doesn't
make any sense...

89
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,708
I don't know why the message

90
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,625
wouldn't be getting
through to you.

91
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,666
I'll have to explain
it out loud, then...

92
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,250
"Warning...

93
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,875
A terrorist has been detected
in the underground mall."

94
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,750
There's a terrorist here?

95
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,875
That's correct...

96
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,250
We're about to
lower the barriers

97
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,125
and seal off
the whole mall...

98
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,250
It's important that you
evacuate immediately...

99
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,250
Now get moving.

100
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,333
I think we should
take her advice...

101
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,791
Let's get out
of here quickly.

102
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,041
I found you.

103
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,000
What the hell is that?

104
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,250
A creature made from
earth to imitate man.

105
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,583
A golem or protector
of the temple...

106
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,583
It's being made to serve as
an English guardian angel.

107
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,791
Are you saying...

108
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,541
the terrorist they
detected is a sorcerer?

109
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,708
Now... let's get
this party started.

110
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,708
You can scream as
loud as you'd like...

111
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,916
Nobody is going to
hear you in this tomb.

112
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,208
What's happening?

113
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,375
Hey...! Let us
out of here!

114
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,583
What's going on?

115
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,625
Open up!

116
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,750
All right, Index...

117
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,000
take Kazakiri and
go hide somewhere.

118
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,458
You take Kazakiri
and hide somewhere...

119
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,875
The enemy is a sorcerer...

120
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,541
And that means this
is a job for me.

121
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,916
How do you expect
to win in a fight?

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,416
You're a tiny little girl!

123
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,041
Listen up...! Do you
think you've survived

124
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,541
this many fights on your
own by being lucky...?

125
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,000
You know perfectly
well you're an amateur

126
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,166
when it comes to magic.

127
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,208
Yeah, right...

128
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,125
How could I possibly
think that...?

129
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,541
I am Toma Kamijo,

130
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,541
the single unluckiest person
on the face of the earth,

131
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,875
so no, I don't...

132
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,166
Not exactly something
to brag about.

133
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,041
Toma, excuse me...

134
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,708
I don't really understand
what's going on...

135
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,250
but if there's anything
I can do to help,

136
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,333
I would like to...

137
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,583
-No way!
-No way!

138
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,416
-Go hide, Index!
-Quick, Toma, run!

139
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,291
That's strange...

140
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,375
I could've sworn I just
heard a cat meow somewhere.

141
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,541
Me too.

142
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,666
Hey...

143
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,041
What are you doing here?

144
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,291
Taking a quick nap?

145
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,125
How scandalous...!

146
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,583
Such behavior, and
at a time like this.

147
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,166
Explain, Toma.

148
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,708
Exactly who are these crass
girls, and why are they here?

149
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,375
You know them?

150
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,583
Um, excuse me...?

151
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,291
Just who the hell do
you think you are...?

152
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,791
Saying something like that
to people you've never met?

153
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,125
Admit it... I'm right.

154
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,000
You do know Toma,
don't you...?

155
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,250
So, what exactly is your
relationship with him?

156
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,416
What...? What
relationship?

157
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,416
How about you start by
telling me who you are.

158
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,041
Well, uh...

159
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,500
I kind of owe my life
to him and stuff.

160
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:49,916
Oh, really...?

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,708
Don't tell me.
He came to your rescue

162
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,458
without asking
if you needed him to.

163
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,375
-Toma!
-Listen up, you!

164
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,458
Uh, yes, ma'am?!

165
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,708
Would you care to explain

166
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,500
your irresponsible
behavior, young man?

167
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,666
Well... You see...

168
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,875
I, um...

169
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,458
I see now...

170
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:11,375
I thought something was feeling
a little bit off lately...

171
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,125
Now I learn Sissy has decided

172
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,708
that my love is
insufficient for her needs

173
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,875
and instead given herself, body
and soul, to Mr. amijo here.

174
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,916
That is absolutely
not what's happening!

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,500
Well... What now?

176
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:25,750
What kind of trouble
have you managed

177
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,541
to get yourself
into this time?

178
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:28,708
How should I know?

179
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,208
Shirai... do you think

180
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,125
you could explain
the situation here?

181
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,041
Authorities have
discovered a terrorist

182
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,875
operating in the
underground mall...

183
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,208
There is a real possibility

184
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,875
of a large-scale battle
breaking out down here...

185
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,708
So I've been charged with
getting all the citizens

186
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,041
who are trapped in the
mall safely evacuated.

187
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,958
They chose me because
I'm a master teleporter.

188
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,041
All right, then
you get to work

189
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,875
getting everybody
out of here...

190
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,041
Meanwhile, I'll see what I
can do to buy you some time...

191
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,958
You're the first one to go.
No arguing!

192
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,958
But don't you understand?

193
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:01,333
With my right hand, I can render
any power ineffective...

194
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,000
I have no choice but to
stay and see what I can do.

195
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,708
We should also consider the
limitations of my power...

196
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,416
I can only carry two
people each trip.

197
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,250
I'm going to
need some time.

198
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,291
Okay... then please take
Index and Kazakiri first.

199
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,791
Really, Toma...?

200
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,833
You want some quality time
alone with the loudmouth girl?

201
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,833
Is that what you're
trying to say?

202
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,375
Okay then... take Misaka
and Kazakiri first.

203
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,583
Oh, I see......

204
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,000
What you want is to stay behind
with this little freak show.

205
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,916
Damn my luck.

206
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,916
Okay then,
you're going first.

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,958
But Kuroko...

208
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,875
Sorry about that...

209
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,916
It's my fault you
got left behind.

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,500
I'll be just fine...

211
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,583
I promise.

212
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,916
Forget me; what about you?

213
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,291
Looks like it's starting.

214
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,333
All right...
I hate to do this...

215
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,625
but you need to wait here until
Kuroko comes back for you.

216
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,041
But... what will you do?

217
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,041
I've got a sorcerer
to take care of.

218
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,833
We're not even
making a dent in it.

219
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,041
Not everyone's
evacuated yet.

220
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,250
We have to do something!

221
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,416
You have considerable
strength,

222
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,666
but you're lacking style...

223
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,833
Ellis!

224
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:56,958
Are you all right?

225
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,000
Are you a student...?!

226
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,041
What are you doing?

227
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,166
You shouldn't be down here.

228
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,250
Well, I'm...

229
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,125
I'm here to...

230
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,958
You're that odd boy
from Miss Tskuyomi's class.

231
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,708
Get back behind
the barricade...!

232
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,041
Right now!

233
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,583
Good afternoon, young man.

234
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,125
Oh, what's this...?

235
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,000
You're the one who
wields Imagine Breaker...

236
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,166
You're not with the key

237
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,541
to the Imaginary
Number School District.

238
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,458
Now what was that
brat's name, again?

239
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,666
Oh, well...

240
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,416
It's not as if she's
the only one I can kill.

241
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,000
I do have options...

242
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll be happy to take time out
of my day to kill you instead.

243
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,583
The power of the earth
is under my control....

244
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,208
You will not
survive for long.

245
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,375
With Ellis, the very
ground will fight you.

246
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,541
Damn sorcerer.

247
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,666
There's no need
to be rude...

248
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,500
Call me Sherry Cromwell.

249
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,416
Regardless... you're
going to die here,

250
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
but I might as
well tell you

251
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,541
I'm with the
English Puritan Church.

252
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,333
That's Index's church...

253
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,916
Why would one of their members
do something like this?

254
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,458
Simple. Because I
want to start a war...

255
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,958
and this will be
what begins it.

256
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,791
So, for maximum impact,

257
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,208
I want to make
sure everyone knows

258
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,875
that I'm one of
the Church's pawns.

259
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,208
I need a plan, here...

260
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,375
If I could just touch
that thing for a second!

261
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,666
U-Um...

262
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,541
Kazakiri!

263
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,916
What are you doing here...?!

264
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,291
You should be
waiting for Shirai!

265
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,875
Well... I know... but I...

266
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,916
Never mind,
just get down now!

267
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,166
Kazakiri!

268
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,500
What the...

269
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,833
What is that?

270
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,250
My... glasses?

271
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,166
My head...

272
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,250
What happened?

273
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,875
Impossible...

274
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,333
No...! W-what's
happening to me?

275
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,208
Kazakiri...

276
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,041
No!

277
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,041
No, not that way!

278
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,833
Now, Ellis!

279
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,875
Kazakiri!

280
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,250
Come along, Ellis...

281
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,500
Our work isn't done yet.

282
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,958
We have more hunting to do.

283
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,291
Geez...

284
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,666
where could those
idiots have gotten to?

285
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,041
What am I supposed
to do now?

286
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,208
Please let us out!!

287
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm worried about what
happened to those two...

288
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,583
but I can't spend
time looking for them

289
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,958
when these people
are trapped.

290
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,583
Kazakiri...

291
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,791
Damn it...

292
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,041
What is that
sorcerer up to now?

293
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,625
I'm kinda busy here.

294
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,541
Oh, good.

295
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,541
Is that you, Kamijo?

296
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,875
Finally, I was
able to get you!

297
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,458
Himegami has been trying to
reach you, without any luck.

298
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,791
She must have called a
hundred times, at least.

299
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,291
-Himegami was calling me?
-Yes...

300
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,583
and there's something important
I need to tell you, too.

301
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,500
Yeah, I'm sorry, but this isn't
really the best time for me...

302
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,500
I have to go.

303
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,708
Does whatever's happening

304
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,333
have something to do
with your new friend?

305
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,333
Please listen to
me for a minute...

306
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,625
We've discovered something
that's very strange...

307
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,333
We don't understand
why or how yet,

308
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,750
but Hyoka Kazakiri

309
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,458
doesn't show up on any
of the security cameras

310
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,875
around the school.

311
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,416
We know that you
were with her...

312
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,458
Can you tell me where, exactly,
she entered the school?

313
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,291
Maybe we can take a closer look
at the cameras in that area.

314
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,833
Wait... can you back up
for a second?

315
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,541
I don't get
what you're saying.

316
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,208
Remember the AIM
diffusion fields

317
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,291
I was telling you about...?

318
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,666
We believe Kazakiri is
somehow connected to them.

319
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,958
Yeah, I remember.

320
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,666
But what do you
mean by "connected?"

321
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,083
Now, keep in mind that this
is all just conjecture...

322
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,208
It has to do with
bioelectricity emissions

323
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,250
and the magnetic fields
that they form...

324
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,958
oxygen consumption and carbon
dioxide expulsion, etcetera.

325
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,458
Basically, we have
all the components

326
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,250
that combine to form a human
being coming together...

327
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,583
in which case... wouldn't
you then expect a person

328
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,291
to be created as a result?

329
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,625
There are all kinds of
espers in Academy City....

330
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,916
And each one is constantly
emitting a slight force

331
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,416
without even
being aware of it.

332
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,125
What if, with so many
fields overlapping,

333
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,500
they begin to coalesce
to create something...?

334
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,041
And what if that
creation is the "person"

335
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,750
we know as Hyoka Kazakiri?

336
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,125
Don't you think that's
a bit of a stretch?

337
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,083
Apparently, there have
been sightings of Kazakiri

338
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,916
going back a long time...

339
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,250
I believe in the
earlier instances,

340
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,125
she was a more
indistinct being...

341
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,375
kind of like what we
imagine ghosts to be.

342
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,916
Maybe... but even if what
you're saying is right,

343
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,166
I don't believe Kazakiri
is aware of it at all.

344
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,833
That's hardly
surprising...

345
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,583
Why wouldn't she believe
she was human...?

346
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,625
She looks like one
and talks like one...

347
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,083
There would be no reason
for her to doubt it.

348
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,875
But regardless of
what she believes...

349
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:18,333
Hyoka Kazakiri is definitely
not a human being.

350
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,666
She is essentially an
anthropomorphic manifestation

351
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,291
of the AIM diffusion fields.

352
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,500
That's crazy.

353
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,875
Damn...

354
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,625
It's almost too
awful to believe.

355
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,750
Awful or not, it's true.

356
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,083
Do you hear what
I'm saying, Kamijo...?

357
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,375
It doesn't matter
that she's made from

358
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,166
all the component parts
that form a person...

359
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,291
not at all...

360
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,625
Despite whatever
you want to believe,

361
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,875
Kazakiri is not human.

362
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,958
Of course... does
that really matter...?

363
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,875
Why does she have to
be a human being...?

364
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,375
Think about it, Kamijo.

365
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,833
How do you see her
now that you know?

366
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,833
Is Hyoka Kazakiri nothing
more than an illusion...?

367
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,458
Is she just some
soulless image

368
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,750
that happened to
appear one day,

369
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,791
haphazardly thrown together?

370
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,583
Is her presence
so insubstantial

371
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,708
that nothing would change
if she disappeared?

372
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,041
No way...! That's not
what she's like at all...!

373
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,083
But even if she was
some ephemeral phantom

374
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,958
that could disappear
at any moment...

375
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,208
I could never
just stand by

376
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,208
and watch while someone
attempted to harm her.

377
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,125
I'm so glad to hear
you say that...!

378
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,750
I love it when my
little lambs figure out

379
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,208
the right thing to
do all on their own.

380
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,166
It's so rewarding to me...

381
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,708
Keep up the good work, Kamijo,

382
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,541
and I'm sure everything will
turn out all right in the end!

383
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,750
You can do it!

384
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,208
Okay then, bye-bye!

385
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,708
My, my, look what I found.

386
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:14,875
You're said to be the key

387
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,625
to the Imaginary
Number School District,

388
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,166
but you are a sorry sight.

389
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,166
I imagined
better than this.

390
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,458
I'll never be able to understand
these science-minded types...

391
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,541
jealously hanging onto
something like you.

392
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,250
Why are you here...?

393
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,791
What is it that
you want from me?

394
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,625
Hold on... what's this...?

395
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,333
Am I sensing a
little fear...?

396
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,625
Don't tell me that
you're actually afraid

397
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,375
to lose your sorry life...

398
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,791
Give me a break!

399
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,333
I can't believe you
haven't figured it out yet.

400
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,875
You are not,
nor will you ever be,

401
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,916
a real human being.

402
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,541
There's no need to go all
pale and trembly on me.

403
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,750
Here...

404
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,500
See? This is all that's
going to happen to you.

405
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,250
It's like smashing
an inanimate object.

406
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,666
Are you beginning
to understand?

407
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,041
You're just like my Ellis ...

408
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,541
A monster.

409
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,083
There is no place
for you here

410
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,916
or anywhere else
in the world.

411
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,708
That doesn't mean
she can't be my friend.

412
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,666
Please, Hyoka! I'd love
it if you'd join us!

413
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,375
Okay... we'll split them...

414
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,833
these can be yours.

415
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,541
Now, now, monster,
there's no need for tears.

416
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,458
Crying only makes
you look more pathetic

417
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,291
and that much
easier to destroy!

418
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,250
I'm really sorry
to keep you waiting.

419
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,083
Don't worry...
Everything will be all right.

420
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:31,958
[Music]

421
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,500
Listen to me, Kazakiri...

422
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,666
Your kindness is
no mere illusion.

423
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,791
It doesn't matter to me
whether you're human or not.

424
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,583
We're going to save you!

425
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,000
Next time, "Friends."

426
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,666
When science and
magic cross paths,

427
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,125
a story is born.
