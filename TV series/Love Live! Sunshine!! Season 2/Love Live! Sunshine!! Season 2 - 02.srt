00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:12,708
[RIKO]
Previously on...

00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,000
[GIRLS]
...Love Live! Sunshine!!

3
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:15,625
[RIKO] Aqours was just
starting to gear up

4
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:17,500
for the next
Love Live competition.

5
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,708
But then we received
some unexpected news...

6
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:23,541
Listen, about the
school's open house.

7
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,250
It's being canceled.

8
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,250
[RIKO] Our hopes of saving
the school were crushed,

9
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,166
and everything looked
pretty hopeless.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,375
[CHIKA]
'Kay! A miracle!

11
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,458
We'll struggle
with all we've got!

12
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,000
We'll never give up!
We'll keep trying!

13
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,500
And we... will shine!

14
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,750
You think everything's
gonna be okay?

15
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,666
[DIA] Hopefully, but it's
not as if the number

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,416
of prospective students
has increased.

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,166
We need to be realistic.

18
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,541
Putting it that way,

19
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,833
it doesn't sound like there's
much hope to go on.

20
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,125
--[door clicks]
--[ALL] Uh?

21
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, Mari?

22
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,750
How did it go?

23
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,458
Sorry, <i>bellas</i> .

24
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,875
He said that no matter how
many people are opposed,

25
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,875
the school can't survive
without students.

26
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,791
Just as we expected.

27
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,291
[MARI]
So, then I asked

28
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,958
if we got more prospective
students, would he reconsider.

29
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,208
[gasps]

30
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,250
And if he would, then how many?

31
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,750
Or more specifically,

32
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,833
how many in order to
keep the school open?

33
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,041
[YOU]
What did he say?

34
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,541
A hundred.

35
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:28,041
A hundred...

36
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,250
[MARI] Right. He said we would
have to recruit a hundred

37
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:33,416
new students by the end of the
year, and if we could do that.

38
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,916
Then they'll hold
an entrance exam,

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,666
and the school will remain open.

40
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,083
But as things stand, we
only have 10 students

41
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,416
who are interested.

42
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,791
How on earth will we ever
get a hundred of them?

43
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,875
[CHIKA] But... that means
there's still a chance!

44
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,458
It's not over.

45
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,833
It may seem difficult,
but none of that matters.

46
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,375
Because, at least we're
all still fighting!

47
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,708
Well, I guess she's
got a good point.

48
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,958
Thanks, Mari! You're the best!

49
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,416
[MARI]
Chika-chi?

50
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,500
As long there's still a
chance, just have faith!

51
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:10,125
Let's try hard for the school,
and for Love Live, too!

52
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,666
We can do it! A hundred!

53
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,458
From zero to one!

54
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:15,916
And from one, to ten!

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,833
From ten to... a hundred!

56
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:55,125
[CHIKA groans]
I don't know what to do.

57
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,291
What do you mean?

58
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,833
[CHIKA] I talked a
big game this morning,

59
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,583
but I honestly didn't expect
the Love Live qualifiers

60
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,041
would be held so soon.

61
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,541
Well, they'd have to with
so many groups entering.

62
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,500
Our district's qualifiers
are early next month, huh?

63
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,625
There's even gonna
be a special stage.

64
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,541
Evil spirits will congregate,
and partake in epic festivities!

65
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,291
But why is it such a big deal
if it's held sooner?

66
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,125
[CHIKA]
Because, um...

67
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,625
Because she probably
hasn't written lyrics.

68
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,833
For real?

69
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,291
Aw! This isn't fair!

70
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,708
I'm not the only one who's
behind, Riko complained

71
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,541
that composing two songs is
a lot of work too, you know!

72
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,583
[RIKO] Not just me.
You complained, too!

73
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,208
Heh. Nine costumes
is a lot of work.

74
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,708
Can't we just use the
songs we sang before?

75
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,041
[DIA]
Unfortunately, no.

76
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,458
Love Live rules state we
can't use previous songs.

77
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,416
We'll have to compose new ones.

78
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,791
They make it too hard.
It's so unfair.

79
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, you have to
overcome that hardship.

80
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,916
Otherwise, how else
you would ever learn

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,166
to appreciate the view
from the summit?

82
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,375
Yeah, I know.

83
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,791
But I still wish it was easier.

84
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,791
So, just where are you
with the lyrics, anyway?

85
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:01,458
Uh! Uh, well, you know,
they're coming along.

86
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,875
[laughs nervously]

87
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,208
[HANAMARU] Look, I found Chika's
songwriting book, zura.

88
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,166
[CHIKA screams]

89
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,458
[CHIKA grunting]

90
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,708
Wow, it's amazin'!

91
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,333
And accurate! [laughs]

92
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,958
It's pretty awesome, huh?

93
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,666
I was up until
two AM last night!

94
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,708
[RIKO growls]

95
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,333
[RUBY, HANAMARU, CHIKA whimper]

96
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,125
Excuse me?

97
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,583
Sorry.

98
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,583
[CHIKA grunts]

99
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,291
You know, it feels kinda wrong

100
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,166
to make Chika and Riko
do all the song stuff.

101
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,375
<i>Si</i> , I agree.

102
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,416
Then maybe you could
help them out, Kanan!

103
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,250
[KANAN] Me? I don't think
that's a good idea.

104
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,958
[MARI] But you used
to write our lyrics.

105
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,166
[KANAN] Yeah, and you
used to do the composing,

106
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,500
so why don't you help them out?

107
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,875
Who made the costumes?

108
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,125
Oh, that was us.

109
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,375
[RUBY]
Yeah.

110
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,791
Ah! I forgot.

111
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,208
Ruby is pretty handy
with a needle and thread.

112
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,166
I'm okay, I guess.

113
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,250
[HANAMARU]
Look at this!

114
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,125
Ruby also made
this bag for me, zura!

115
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,250
How cute!

116
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,500
Did you also do the embroidery?

117
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,000
[RUBY]
Yes...

118
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,458
Uh?

119
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,541
Okay then, why don't we try
splitting up all the work?

120
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,250
[ALL]
Split the work?

121
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,166
[MARI] You, Chika-chi, and
Riko will work on the song

122
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,666
for the open house.
The rest of us will create

123
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,250
a song for the Love
Live qualifiers.

124
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,041
That will take some of the
pressure off of Chika-chi.

125
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,416
I guess. But hold on,

126
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,875
I don't know the first thing
about writing a song.

127
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,125
Which is why we're going
to work together!

128
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,291
I'm <i>positivo</i> we can do this!

129
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,000
Our song might even turn out
better than Chika's group.

130
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,041
Not "might." I know our song
will be better than theirs.

131
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,583
It's our responsibility
as senior idols.

132
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,083
Yeah! Tell 'em, Dia!

133
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,250
Sounds fun! So,
we'll compete to see

134
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,416
which group makes a
better song first, okay?

135
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,250
Let's do it!

136
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,166
Uh, right!

137
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,416
I'm in.

138
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,166
Okay! So, it's settled,
we'll split into groups

139
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,458
and start working
on our songs, <i>pronto</i> !

140
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,791
All right!
Best of luck, everyone!

141
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,125
[YOU, RIKO]
Mm...

142
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,833
'Kay, we're setting sail
for Chika's house, see ya!

143
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,666
Happy writin', zura!

144
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,708
[RIKO]
Did you remember...

145
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,958
Well then.

146
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,833
I guess we should find
a place and get to work.

147
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:05,083
If we wanna stick around here,
there's always the club room.

148
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,458
Personally, I'd prefer
a change of scenery.

149
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,708
That's fair enough.

150
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,083
Perhaps we should all
follow their example,

151
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,791
and go work at someone's house?

152
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,083
[KANAN]
How 'bout Mari's place?

153
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,458
[MARI]
What? Why mine?

154
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,833
For starters,
it's fairly spacious.

155
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,041
Secondly, it happens
to be close by.

156
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,416
Hey, is it true?

157
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,083
I heard a rumor that Mari's
family is super wealthy.

158
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,250
Far as I know.

159
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,750
Basically, we're entering

Exactly! That is of course
to say nothingness,

217
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,458
doesn't mean there is nothing,
but instead it means the state

218
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,625
of nothingness exists, zura.
That is true nothingness.

Right, Yoshiko. Pure nothingness
is indeed the end goal.

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,166
And once you're there,
you can finally achieve

the ultimate mental state, zura.

It's Yohane, and nothingness
is a divine power

use that as an excuse

work together.

It's only a thought, but what
this really comes down to

00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,583
Leave it to me!

318
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,125
What, have you got a plan?

319
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,208
[KANAN] Mm-hm! When you wanna
become friends with someone

320
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,583
you don't know,
you play together.

321
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,083
Trust me, it never fails!

322
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,875
Nice throw!

323
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,583
What... is this?

324
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,458
Dunno.

325
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,541
Right, it's my turn!

326
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,375
[HANAMARU, YOSHIKO yelp]

327
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,916
Mari's Bright Shining.

328
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,666
Ah! Zura!

329
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,083
I've got this!

330
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,750
[YOSHIKO]
Darkness consumes power.

331
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,125
By extinguishing the light,
its power is neutralized

332
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:47,041
and trapped in the depths
of darkness. Behold!

333
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,125
Tornado!

334
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,583
[YOSHIKO]
Dark-Consuming power!

335
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,583
[HANAMARU]
Uh!

336
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,875
[YOSHIKO groans]

337
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,125
Zura?

338
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,625
--[RUBY squeaks]
--[DIA] Ruby! Are you okay?

339
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,500
Speak to me!

340
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,083
My bad!

341
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,500
This kinda activity is a
little more on my level.

342
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,958
[RUBY]
Mine, too.

343
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,541
[YOSHIKO laughs] My heart,
which was defiled by light,

344
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,583
is now purified
through darkness.

345
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,166
[GIRLS laughing]

346
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,291
[HANAMARU, RUBY]
Look at your face!

347
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:17,500
Stop it! It's not funny!
It's a stigma!

348
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,625
[sighs] I'm bored.

349
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:23,375
Yeah, me too. Why can't we
just go to the beach?

350
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,750
Aw, I know that readin' books

351
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,708
is typically more of a solo
activity. Still though.

352
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,250
If we all read together,

353
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,000
then we can tell each other
what we thought of our books...

354
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,333
They're asleep?

355
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,833
I'm afraid their attention
spans are rather short.

356
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,750
So. I've been thinking,

357
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,875
and here's what I
figured out so far.

358
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,458
There are two groups.

359
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,791
Wow. This would be the perfect
day to go diving, dontcha think?

360
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,375
<i>Si</i> , I'll totally go
with you sometime!

361
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,083
The third-year students
prefer outdoor activities.

362
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,583
[gasps]

363
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,500
This is the perfect opportunity
to summon some new demons.

364
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,041
While the first-year students
prefer to be indoors--

365
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,541
reading books and such.

366
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,166
So, what are we gonna do?

367
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,708
I do have one idea.

368
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,208
Did you find a solution?

369
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,875
At a time like this,
what this group needs to do

370
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,958
is reveal our deepest selves!

371
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,250
In other words--we need
to open up to each other.

372
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,375
[ALL]
Open up?

373
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,583
How simplistic.

374
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,000
Yes, it's tradition.
Since olden times,

375
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,958
bathing together has been
a part of our culture.

376
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,500
Not only does it bring us
together, but it builds

377
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,875
communication while
encouraging team work.

378
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,875
That's nice, but it's
way too early for a bath.

379
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,375
A fallen angel would
never reveal her body.

380
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,833
I'm staying in here!

381
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:32,791
[HANAMARU]
Look, Yoshiko!

382
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,375
[YOSHIKO]
Uh?

383
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,583
[HANAMARU] They have a milk bath
of darkness over there, zura!

384
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,708
[GIRLS]
What is she talking about?

385
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,958
Oh, really?

386
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,416
[laughing]

387
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,041
The bath... It's creating a
pathos, and it's amazing!

388
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:50,000
You know, it sounds really
creepy when you put it that way.

389
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:50,958
Nuh-uh!

390
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,958
I'm like, so totally bored.

391
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:56,083
Yeah, I'm kinda over
this dumb bath idea already.

392
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,875
Seriously?! You could try
to be a little more patient!

393
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,791
Huh? Where'd Ruby go?

394
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,291
[RUBY grunting]

395
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,500
--Ah! This is heavenly!
--[drip]

396
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,458
[KANAN] We just wasted
all that time bathing,

397
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,500
and now it's raining.

398
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,625
[MARI]
Here, Kanan.

399
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:18,916
Thanks, Mari.

400
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,083
[GIRLS sigh]

401
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,000
It feels like we haven't
achieved anything.

402
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,125
Yeah, fat lot of good
that bath did us.

403
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,041
It did me good--I'm so relaxed!

404
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,875
Me, too.

405
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,666
In the end, I wasn't able
to solve anything.

406
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,916
--It's hopeless.
--Yep.

407
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,125
I think our differences
might be more obvious.

408
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,958
[RUBY] This is awful.
I don't even have my umbrella.

409
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,250
[YOSHIKO]
What should we do now?

410
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,875
Go back to where
we were earlier?

411
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,583
[KANAN]
It's kinda far in the rain.

412
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:46,458
[RUBY sneezes] But we probably
shouldn't stay out here, either.

413
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,583
[ALL sigh]

414
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,041
There's a temple. My family's
acquainted with it

415
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,375
and it's actually not
too far from here.

416
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,625
[ALL]
Uh?

417
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,708
You can come in, zura.

418
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,083
Oh. But, is it okay?

419
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,250
You sure?

420
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,375
[HANAMARU]
Uh-huh, I asked and they said

421
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,708
to make ourselves at home.

422
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:13,208
[DIA] But, wouldn't we be
disrupting the owner?

423
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,791
[HANAMARU] Not really,
since they don't live here.

424
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,291
We're all by ourselves.

425
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,291
[RUBY squeaks]

426
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,958
[DIA]
I guess we have no choice.

427
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,958
At least it's better than
standing in the rain.

428
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,583
[MARI]
Especially since it doesn't look

429
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,625
like it's going to let up.

430

[RUBY, KANAN squeak]

431
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,458
[YOSHIKO laughs]
The power of the darkness,

432
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:33,125
and the power of little
demons. I can feel--

433
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,541
It's a Buddhist temple.

434
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,291
Right, I knew that.

435
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,625
[YOSHIKO]
Uh. Where's the light switch?

436
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,666
[HANAMARU]
They don't have lights.

437
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,416
Wow, for real?

438
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,791
[GIRLS groan]

439
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,208
So, what should we do?

440
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,708
Not that I'm the least bit
scared, mind you.

441
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,208
--[creak]
--[yelps] Hug!

442
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,541
I guess we could work on
our song, if you want.

443
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,375
[RUBY] But what if you all
start fighting again?

444
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,875
Uh. I mean, we have
to write a song anyway,

445
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,458
so we might as well
all pull together

446
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,750
and give it a fair shot.

447
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,083
It's worth a try.

448
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,333
Who knows?
Maybe we'll crank one out.

449
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,666
That'd be wonderful.

450
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,750
Anyone come up with any lyrics?

451
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:18,250
I saw Yoshiko writing some.
I bet they're pretty good.

452
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,916
Hey, don't be so nosy!

453
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,500
Oh? That's great.

454
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,041
--Way to go!
--Good job!

455
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,458
[YOSHIKO chuckles]
I've hidden my lyric book

456
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,875
and to find where it is,

457
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,291
you'll have to solve a
complex set of riddles.

458
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,083
Each one more complicated
than the last!

459
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,041
I found it!

460
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,291
You cheated!

461
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,416
[RUBY]
What's it say?

462
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,000
[KANAN]
"The Ordeal of Shooting Scars"?

463
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,208
[YOSHIKO]
It's Order of Shooting Stars!

464
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,208
[DIA] What's with these
horrid ink blotches?

465
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,916
[YOSHIKO]
They're Black Blanks, duh!

466

--[creak]
--[gasps]

468
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,791
[YOSHIKO] Well, maybe it's
because I don't want you to,

469
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,208
ever think of that?!

470
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,125
[HANAMARU] That sounds like
a handy excuse, zura.

471
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,416
[RUBY] So, how's the
composing coming along?

472
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,750
[MARI]
It's coming.

super energetic as well!

What's this? A shrine kitty?

475
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:01,958
[HANAMARU]
How energetic is it?

476
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,875
[DIA] Hold on a second, this
Black Blank thingie moves.

477
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:05,958
How odd.

478
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,291
[RUBY]
Wait. Oh my gosh, it's a bug!

479
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,625
[RUBY, DIA scream]

480
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,500
[GIRLS]
Huh?

481
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,583
[HANAMARU]
Zura?

482
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:17,291
[GIRLS scream]

483
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,208
What are we going to do?

484
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,541
This is terrible.

485
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,541
We still can't work
together at all.

486
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,916
At the rate we're going,

487
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,791
we'll never be able to come
up with a decent song.

488
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,541
Yeah, maybe you're right.

489
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,458
Well, this sucks.

490
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:46,125
It's just hard to believe
that we're so different.

491
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,291
--[drip]
--[BOTH yelp]

492
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,541
The roof's leakin'!

493
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,916
What'll we do?

494
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,875
Look, we can use these plates!

495
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:00,000
It's leaking here,
too! I need...

496
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,666
Here Mari, set one of these
bowls down under the leak.

497
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,375
[YOSHIKO] There's another one,
hand me a plate!

498
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,375
[KANAN]
Okay!

499
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,625
[HANAMARU]
I need one too, zura.

500
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,208
[RUBY] Sis! Do you see
a bucket or anything?

501
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,083
[DIA]
I'll check!

502
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,458
[GIRLS chattering]

503
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,375
[DIA]
Found one!

504
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:18,166
[rain clinking]

505
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,708
[clinking continues,
music plays]

506
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,500
[BOTH laugh]

507
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,333
Hear the tempo and the tone?

508
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,666
The way it sounds.

509
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,041
They're all different,

510
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,541
and right now they may
sound a little out of sync.

511
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,041
But they're coming
together, one by one.

512
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,666
And they're harmonizing,
one by one.

513
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,416
Together, it's starting
to make a song.

514
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,083
We can do it too, zura.

515
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:30,708
[GIRLS laughing]

516
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,083
[MARI]
Okay!

517
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,083
We'll have an impromptu
training camp here tonight!

518
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,875
--[HANAMARU] Zura?
--[GIRLS] What?!

519
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,958
[RIKO]
Chika!

520
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:47,208
Why on earth are you
up on the roof?

521
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,791
--I'm shining.
--[RIKO] What?

522
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,708
[CHIKA] I saw something,
and what I want to say,

523
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,250
what I've been thinking...

524
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,708
...I think it's the answer
to the question...

525
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,166
...the one that I've
been asking myself...

526
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,708
Finally...

527
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,208
That's great news.

528
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,041
[KANAN]
Chika!

529
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,416
Ah! Morning!

530
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,083
[YOU]
Did you finish your song?

531
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,208
Naturally! Of course, we did!

532
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,750
[GIRLS]
See?!

533
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,125
That's awesome!

534
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,500
[RIKO]
Now we just have to practice.

535
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:18,875
[YOU]
Since we have two songs,

536
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,666
we'll have to work
twice as hard!

537
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,791
[CHIKA] Yep! For our school,
and for Love Live!

538
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,333
[GIRLS]
Next time, "Rainbow."
