00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:16,666
[YOSHIKO] We journeyed to
the promise land in the north,

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,125
and there, Ruby and Leah decided
to perform a dark ritual.

5
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,708
[LEAH]
Good afternoon.

6
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:26,625
[RUBY] So I... I mean...
the two of us are here...

7
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,291
[YOSHIKO] At first
they were frightened,

8
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,291
but they were determined
to enact the ritual

9
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,375
using only their own power.

10
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,791
And then,
on that fateful night...

11
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,333
[LEAH, RUBY] Will you come
watch our special concert?

12
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,208
It'd mean so much.

13
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,625
[WOMAN A]
Please come back, Miss!

14

[WOMAN B]
Miss Mari, we beg of you!

15
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,041
Is this really okay?

16
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,083
Maybe we're
taking things too far.

17
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,541
Should we go back?

18
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:51,750
[MARI]
No!

19
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,583
We have to find
a shooting start to wish on,

20
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,833
or else it'll never work.

21
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,833
So where would be a good place
to look at stars?

22
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,541
I don't know.

23

Let's try up there!

[DIA]
It's cloudy.

27
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,500
Hold on, we should probably
check the star chart

28
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,125
one more time.

Oh no.

31
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,875
We can't see any stars
with this weather.

32
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,458
Now what?

33
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,416
[MARI]
But we came all this way.

34
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,541
It's not fair.

35
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:54,916

Don't cry, Mari!

[KANAN]
Now we can make our wish!

40

Here's to good fortune.

Funny that you'd mention
good fortune, Shima.

Y'know, since today is special.

It's New Year's!

in the big scheme of things
I'm technically still a child,

60
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,125
and we all know that children

61
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,833
get a little something
on New Year's.

62
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,333
Something that happens to be
round and valuable?

Aha!

64
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,333

This is kinda round.

from her book, Chika?

Every family has their own
way of doing things, though!

At least that's
what you always tell me

00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,750
[RIKO] I might die
before the Love Live finals.

165
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,666
Do you really think
this will help us win?

166
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,416
[SARAH] I think you've
got a good chance.

167
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,333
[CHIKA]
You mean it?

168
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,458
Absolutely.

169
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,208
When you're all up on stage,

170
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,791
you have a special way of
connecting with the audience.

171
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,750
If you're able to convey
the feelings you have

172
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,291
right now organically,

173
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,458
I have no doubt that you'll
put on a beautiful performance.

174
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,166
Right!

175
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,625
[RUBY]
Hey, where's Mari?

176
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,416
[CHIKA]
That's odd.

177
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,333
Oh yeah.

178
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,625
She stepped away for a moment

179
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,541
because she had a
phone call from her parents.

180
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,416
Do you think maybe her dad
decided to cancel the merger?

181
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,291
I say! That merger was a
wretched idea, old chap.

182
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,666
Let's cancel the bugger.

183
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,208
You should probably
lay off the television, zura.

184
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,291
[MARI]
I'm back!

185
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,250
[DIA]
How'd your phone call go?

186
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,500
Director?

187
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,875
That's right.

188
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,791
They decided to offer me
the director position

189
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,708
at the new merged school.

190
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,583
With so many
Uranohoshi High students

191
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,875
starting there next year,

192
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,666
they thought having
a familiar face like mine

193
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,750
might help the students settle
in a little bit better, ya know?

194
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,000
A director?

195
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,500
We probably should have
mentioned that

196
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,583
Mari's the director
for this school.

197
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,166
No way!

198
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,041
Wait, so that means Mari will go
to school with us next Spring.

199
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,625
Aqours will live on!

200
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,583
Chika, that makes it
sound like she's failing.

201
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,958
[MARI]
Actually,

202
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:24,958
I turned it down.

203
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,458
[GIRLS]
What?

204
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,416
I declined the position.

205
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,916
After graduation,

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,541
I've decided that I'm going to
attend a college in Italy.

207
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:36,250
It's a good school
that Papa recommended.

208
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,333
So I have
three months left here.

209
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,666
Then I'll be leaving Japan.

210
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,291
Well then.

211
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,750
I wish you both
didn't have leave so soon.

212
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,500
Yeah, me too, but we
have one more stop to make.

213
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,416
Where ya goin'?

214
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,083
[RUBY]
Oh, I know the answer!

215
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,250
They're going to visit
an amusement park!

216
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,791
You're such a blabber mouth!

217
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,416
[RUBY squeaks]

218
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,500
Take this.

219
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,250
It's a training regimen
my sister and I

220
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,666
came up with for you.

221
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,166
Wow, thank you.

222
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,583
Whoa! That's intense!

223
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,583
Do you wanna win
Love Live or not?

224
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,333
It's gonna take some effort.

225
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,458
This event is more than
just making a memory, right?

226
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,500
We believe you can win it.

227
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,625
So go get 'em.

228
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:18,583
'Kay.

229
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,125
We'll do our Rubesty!

230
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,208
Your what now?

231
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,500
It's Ruby's super-secret
technique, zura!

232
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,583
[RUBY whimpers]

233
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,375
[YOSHIKO]
You call that a technique?

234
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,875
[GIRLS laugh]

235
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,875
So Italy, huh?

236
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:36,875
You know what?

237
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,208
To be completely honest,

238
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,875
I actually thought
this sort of thing might happen.

239
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,833
But when that thought
becomes a reality...

240
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,125
I can't believe it's only
three months away.

241
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,375
Love Live will be over,
then Mari will graduate.

242
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,125
And not just Mari, either.

243
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,500
Dia and Kanan
will also graduate.

244
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,666
Once spring arrives,

245
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,666
there'll be no more going
home together after school,

246
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,291
no more long drawn out
goodbyes at the bus stop.

247
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,916
New uniforms.

248
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,916
New classrooms.

249
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,833
Where are you going?

250
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,000
[RIKO]
What will happen to Aqours?

251
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,041
[YOU] Yeah, after the
third years graduate?

252
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,500
[CHIKA]
I don't know.

253
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,125
I haven't thought about it.

254
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,500
Until Love Live is over

255
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,333
and until we know the
results of the finals,

256
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,250
I feel like, maybe we
shouldn't think too much about

257
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,416
what comes next.

258
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,958
For everyone's sake?

259
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,083
We'll focus on Love Live.

260
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,500
We'll put our
heart and soul into it.

261
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,166
And no matter what,
we'll find a way to win.

262
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,250
I bet our radiance will be
waiting on that stage.

263
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,458
Let's do it.

264
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,375
Then we can show them,
everyone at school.

265
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:55,750
Mari, Dia, and Kanan,
we'll make them all proud.

266
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,583
Uh, Riko?

267
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,208
Good idea.

268
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,291
--[CHIKA] Stop it.
--[RIKO giggles]

269
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,583
[YOU]
Sounds like a plan!

270
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,583
[GIRLS laugh]

271
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,375
[MARI] Wow, it's been forever
since we've been in this tunnel!

272
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,875
It's very relaxing.

273
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,583
I agree.

274
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,791
[MARI]
So. What's up, <i>bellas</i> ?

275
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,375
Now let me guess.

276
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,625
Are you two planning to try and
talk me out of going to Italy?

277
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,333
[KANAN] If this were a year ago,
yeah, we might've tried.

278
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,833
'Kay, then are you
upset I didn't tell you?

279
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:37,916
Is that it?

280
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,791
We're not mad about anything.

281
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,916
We have our own news to share.

282
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,041
Huh?

283
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,541
I'd been waiting to tell you,

284
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,666
but I've been accepted
to a college in Tokyo.

285
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,958
And I'm gonna travel overseas

286
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,291
to get my diving
instructor's license.

287
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,208
Well, after graduation.

288
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,916
Meaning?

289
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,333
[KANAN]
Mm.

290
00:12:56,416 --> 00:13:00,125
Once high school's done,
we'll all go our separate ways.

291
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,541
None of us are
staying in Uchiura,

292
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,041
which will make visiting
each other rather difficult.

293
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,208
That's what we wanted
to talk to you about.

294
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,875
[MARI]
I see.

295
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,166
[KANAN] I can't believe we
made all these big decisions

296
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,416
without talking
to each other first.

297
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,166
Right? It is pretty ironic.

298
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,958
Considering we had
a fight about it, remember?

299
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,416
Of course!

300
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,458
Come 'ere.

301
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,958
Hug.

302
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,166
[KANAN] Gosh Mari, I remember
you used to sneak out a lot.

303
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,250
It's not as if you two
were any more innocent.

304
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,000
Actually, we had to sneak out
to keep you in line.

305
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,375
To be fair, if I had asked
for permission to come see you,

306
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,041
my parents would have said no.

307
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,500
As I recall, that's also why
your parents became so strict.

308
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,916
[KANAN] Yeah, they thought
moving your room

309
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
to the second floor
would stop you.

310
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,791
[DIA] Then they moved you
to the third.

311
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:07,916
[KANAN]
And when that didn't work,

312
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,625
up you went to the fourth floor.

313
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,291
[MARI]
I wound up on the top floor.

314
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,791
[DIA]
Looking back on it,

315
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,291
you must have been a real
headache for your poor parents.

316
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,583
Well, they probably
should have been

317
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,291
more willing to let me
play with you, then.

318
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,291
Wait, didn't they once
threaten to disown you?

319
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,333
Yeah, I said, "If you don't
let me play with Kanan and Dia,

320
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,708
then I'll disown <i>you</i> ,
mom and dad!"

321
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,291
[DIA] I'll never forget the
look on your parents' faces

322
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,708
when you threatened to do that.

323
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,125
It was priceless.

324
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,625
[MARI] Weren't you the one
who gave me the idea, Dia?

325
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,291
Did I really say that?

326
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,458
We were just being kids.

327
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,291
[MARI]
But, we had fun.

328
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:48,291
And every day, we had
<i>nuovo</i> adventures together.

329
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,958
[MARI] I won't say this again,
so you'd better listen.

330
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:58,541
Getting to know the two of you
taught me so many things.

331
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,291
I learned that
the world is a big place,

332
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,166
and that when you're
with your friends,

333
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,125
sometimes you have
so much fun that you

334
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,625
forget about time entirely.

335
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:11,875
I even learned how to fight,
and how to make up.

336
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,916
If I hadn't met you two,
and gone outside,

337
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,833
I would have never learned
any of those things.

338
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,041
Who knows?

339
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,750
I might not have
left that room at all.

340
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,791
[MARI]
Ever since that day,

341
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,625
I've always believed
that if we were together,

342
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,958
then we could
accomplish anything.

343
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,500
I still believe it.

344
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,250
What I'm trying to say is

345
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,833
thank you.

346
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,541
[DIA]
It's starting to rain.

347
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,541
Again?

348
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,833
Jeez, way to go, Dia.

349
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,666
What? How is this my fault?

350
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,625
Mari's the one
who attracts rain.

351
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,916
Hey! It's not me, it's Kanan!

352
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,791
Sure, whatever!

353
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,625
Know what I think?

354
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,875
It's always raining because

355
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,791
God just doesn't want
our wish to come true.

356
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,500
You mean the wish that the three
of us will always be together?

357
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,916
Well if we can disown my parents

358
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,041
then surely we can disown
a narrow-minded god.

359
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,125
[ALL laugh]

360
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,208
I wonder.

361
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,625
Should it end like this?

362
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,125
Huh?

363
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,458
[KANAN] Are we really okay
that we can't wish on a star?

364
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,958
Just like we couldn't make
our wish all those years ago?

365
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,583
Kanan...

366
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,833
Look, it isn't for me.

367
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,125
But you thought the three of us

368
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,041
could do anything
together, right?

369
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,500
So shouldn't we try?

370
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,875
Maybe.

371
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,291
Besides, it's not just about
the three of us anymore.

372
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,416
Let's go find a star
we'll all wish on.

373
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,750
A star that's only for us.

374
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,875
[MARI]
A star that's only for us?

375
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,250
Okay.

376
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,875
Oh!

Sweet! Money!

[CHIKA]
"Go to the hot spring"?

Yay, New Year's gift!

Hm?

[CHIKA]
Where's Mom?

388
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,333
Back in Tokyo.

Really?

390
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,958
Yep, that's right.

391
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,333
And she asked me to
pass this note along.

392
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,666
[CHIKA]
The ball at the front door?

393
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,500
That's so sweet.

Thanks, everyone.

Feel like going out?

Go out? Wait,
you mean in the rain?

What's going on?

400
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,083
We were all asked to come here.

401
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,041
Which is honestly
pretty annoying.

402
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,416
Because I had planned on
livestreaming tonight.

403
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,625
I think it's kind of exciting.

right after her birthday.

It's kind of strange.

I never imagined that one day
I'd be sitting next to Mari

while she was
driving us somewhere.

I could say the same thing.

Because I never imagined we'd
be doing this together either.

[KANAN] Well, I suppose
it's more comforting

441
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,208
than the idea of Dia driving.

Oh yeah? I'd take Mari over
your driving any day, Kanan!

Yeah.

really think about it,

Yup, that's why we brought you.

going to wish for, Mari?

[MARI]
Isn't it obvious?

466
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,916
Could it be "I wish we'll
always be together"?

467
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,333
You mean as we're
about to be separated?

468
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,916
Exactly.

Which is why it's so important.

If I make that wish,

then we'll be together
again one day for sure!

[MARI]
Uh?

478
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,000

We just have to wait a little

479
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,791
for this weather to clear up.

When it does,
we'll see the stars!

So let's wait together,
and then we'll make a wish!

disown the sky, too.

485
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,708
[GIRLS laugh]

486
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,291
[GIRLS gasp]

487
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,125
Amazing. It really cleared up.

488
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,791
Oh, look!

489
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,208
A fallen angel?

490
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,208
[HANAMARU]
More like a shooting star, zura.

491
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,208
[RUBY]
There's another one!

492
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,083
[YOU]
I can't believe it!

493
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,291
[YOSHIKO] They're the
tears of little demons.

494
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,666
[HANAMARU] Once again,
they're shooting stars.

495
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,625
[RUBY]
It's so pretty.

496
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,500
[RIKO]
Look at that one!

497
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,000
[CHIKA]
Our radiance.

498
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:21,666
I wished for...
our very own radiance,

499
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,500
and that we'd find it, together.

500
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:50,666
[GIRLS] Next time,
"Uranohoshi Girls' High School."
