[DIA] Turns out that
having fewer students

Besides, that means
there's still time.

If we look on the

then we should know
the exact number.

[MARI] What's going on
with the video views?

Well, he's in a
different time zone,

Mm. Yeah, kinda.

I told him we were going
to the final round

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,083
and that our video is
getting a ton of views.

[MARI sighs]

93
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,791
On the plus side, he did agree
to give us an extension.

00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,750
However, just until
5 AM our time.

If we don't have a

323
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,916
this will actually be their
final Love Live performance.

324
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,708
That's why... I want...

325
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:45,541
...to win!

326
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,333
No matter what!

327
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,375
Ruby.

328
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,583
Brava! We're totally
going to win!

329
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,916
[KANAN] That's a little
easier said than done.

330
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,041
[RIKO]
But...

331
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,333
We have to believe we can win.

332
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,708
I know we can.

333
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,583
[MARI] Well then,
time to get warmed up.

334
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,833
[KANAN] All right, we'll
start off nice and slow.

335
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,791
[GIRLS]
Okay!

336
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,833
[KANAN]
First, let's stretch it out.

337
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,083
And start.

338
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,625
--[GIRLS] 1, 2...
--[CHIKA] Yeah.

339
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:17,166
I guess all we can do is focus
on Love Live for right now.

340
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:26,083
[GIRLS] ...3, 4.
3, 2, 3, 4. 4, 2, 3, 4.

341
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,833
1, 2, 3, 4.

342
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,875
Something wrong?

343
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,333
You okay?

344
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,583
Chika.

345
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,250
[CHIKA]
What's up?

346
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,958
Why'd you stop?

347
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,666
You know what?

348
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,000
Let's just call it a day.

349
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,875
[gasps] What for?

350
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm okay.

351
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,166
I'm sorry.

352
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,791
I thought we should
focus on the future,

353
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,000
even if we had to
force ourselves.

354
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,166
But feelings don't really
work that way, do they?

355
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,916
I'm seriously okay!

356
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,625
Besides, you heard
what Ruby said earlier.

357
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,125
This will be our
last performance.

358
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,083
So we...

359
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:17,875
...we need--

360
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,083
It's not just you.

361
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,166
[CHIKA gasps]

362
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,416
It's everyone here.

363
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,416
Look, we are only human.

364
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,375
Did you honestly believe
that we can all just

365
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,375
let go of our feelings?

366
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,125
[KANAN]
You know what.

367
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,333
I think it would be best if we
all took some time to think.

368
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,375
About whether or not we
should really perform

369
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,208
in the Love Live final round.

370
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,125
It'd be good for us.

371
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,833
Yes, that's a good idea.

372
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,541
Hey, what do you mean?

373
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,166
Of course we're going to
perform at Love Live!

374
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,333
How could we not?

375
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,833
What about the third years?

376
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,250
Do you really feel that way?

377
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,416
That's what you need to
dig deep and ask yourself.

378
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,291
Not just Chika-chi,
but all of us.

379
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,916
Why hello!

380
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,541
Morning.

381
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,458
[RIKO]
How 'bout that?

382
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,208
Looks like we're all here.

383
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,666
Indeed.

384
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,833
[MARI]
This proves it!

385
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,250
Everyone feels the
same way after all.

386
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,875
[RIKO] I would definitely
feel better if we performed.

387
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,458
[RUBY] But... we weren't
able to save our school.

388
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,291
Is it really okay to go to
the final round and sing?

389
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,125
[YOSHIKO] Winning
wouldn't save our school.

390
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,416
Well yes, you're
not wrong there.

391
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,250
Still though, let's face it,
that's not why we became idols.

392
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,791
What's the real reason
behind us forming Aqours?

393
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,916
We wanted to find our radiance.

394
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,416
Not just in each other,

395
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,041
but to find our own
individual radiance as well.

396
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:03,666
We can--

397
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,291
No we can't.

398
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,666
Because even if we
manage to win Love Live,

399
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,833
our school will still be gone.

400
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,750
If we had, by some miracle,
saved our school,

401
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,833
then I think we could've shined.

402
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,666
We could have
found our radiance.

403
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,583
But we didn't save our school.

404
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:24,750
So how are we supposed
to find our radiance?!

405
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,000
Right now,

406
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,041
I don't care about
winning Love Live anymore.

407
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,833
I don't care about
finding our radiance.

408
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,916
I want to save our school!

409
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,583
Because this is where we all
spent so much time together.

410
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,791
[MUTSU]
Then save it!

411
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:45,958
[gasps]

412
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,750
[YOSHIMI]
Yeah, go and save it!

413
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,208
Perform in Love Live!

414
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,291
[YOSHIMI, ITSUKO, MUTSU]
And win it all!

415
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,750
No way.

416
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,000
If I could, I'd do
it in a heartbeat!

417
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:58,500
If I could keep struggling
with everyone, then I would!

418
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,875
You would what?!

419
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:00,916
I would...

420
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,541
...I would keep
our school alive!

421
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,375
[ITSUKO] But is that the only
way you can keep it alive?

422
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,375
[MUTSU] The thing is, we asked
everyone here at school!

423
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,583
What they wanted the
nine of you to do,

424
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,583
and what would
make them all happy!

425
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,333
Everyone said the same thing.

426
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,916
We want Aqours to win Love Live!

427
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,083
Don't just win it
for yourselves,

428
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,083
but win it for all of us, too!

429
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,708
Win it for the whole school!

430
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,416
[YOSHIMI] You can
preserve our school's name

431
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,833
as the winners of Love Live!

432
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,083
Our school's name?

433
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,291
Everything is up to you now!

434
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,125
You're the only
hope we have left!

435
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,333
Please go to Love Live
and perform!

436
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,500
Aqours,

437
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,291
you are the Uranohoshi
High School Idols!

438
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:49,416
Win and make that name a
part of Love Live history.

439
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,041
Immortalize our school,

440
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,000
so the world will never
forget Uranohoshi!

441
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,583
[YOSHIMI, ITSUKO, MUTSU]
We want you. We want you.

442
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,416
We want you!

443
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,166
[ALL]
To find your radiance!

444
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:06,375
Right, if we win, they'll
record our school's name.

445
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,791
So let's win Love Live.

446
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,250
[CHIKA crying]

447
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,500
Hey, Chika.

448
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,958
[YOU, RIKO]
You give up?

449
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,083
[CHIKA]
How could I give up!

450
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:20,166
I can't do that, I can't
do that, I won't do that!

451
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,750
We're gonna win!

452
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:25,375
No, we won't just win, we're
gonna knock it out of the park!

453
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:28,208
We'll win at Akiba Dome
in that final round.

454
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,916
No matter who we face!

455
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,250
You better believe.

456
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,041
We'll leave our school's
name in Love Live history!

457
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,625
We'll immortalize our
school and our memories!

458
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,083
Yeah!

459
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,416
Come on Love Live, hit us
with everything you've got!

460
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,708
We're not afraid!

461
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,583
For real! I feel
like we could take on

462
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,125
the whole world right now!

463
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,666
I agree!

464
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,791
Attention my little demons,
the final battle has now begun!

465
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,833
It's time for Yohane
to descend at last!

466
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,333
[YOU]
Let's go for a run!

467
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,958
I gotta get rid of this energy!

468
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,375
Come on, everyone!

469
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,291
But I don't wanna!

470
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,750
--[MARI laughs]
--[RUBY] No!

471
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,000
Hey, hurry up, Riko!

472
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,958
So long "normal monster."

473
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:08,083
'Cause now there's a much
stronger monster in town.

474
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,958
Named Chika.

475
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,541
[YOSHIKO]
Wait for me, everyone!

476
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,375
Don't leave me!

477
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,875
[CHIKA giggles]

478
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,000
[GIRLS]
Next time, "Hakodate."
