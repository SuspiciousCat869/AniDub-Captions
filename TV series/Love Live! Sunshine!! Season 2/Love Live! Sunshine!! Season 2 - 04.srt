<i>Love Live! Sunshine!!</i>

00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:14,375
[HANAMARU]
Zura!

4
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:15,708
Aqours found ourselves in a bind

5
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,083
when we had to perform
two concerts in one day.

6
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:20,416
And take flight,
eternal phoenix!

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,958
How far's the school from there?

8
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,000
[KANAN] It's over here,
but there's no bus or train

9
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,000
that goes all the
way there, so...

10
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,541
[HANAMARU] We did our
best to try and make it

11
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,708
to both concerts,
but it was a struggle.

12
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,208
Need a lift, girls?

13
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,208
Hop on board!

14
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,625
[HANAMARU]
Luckily, we had some friends

15
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,875
who were willin' to
lend us a hand, zura!

16
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:41,208
Thanks to them, our concerts
were a huge success!

17
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,500
[RIKO yawns]

18
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,166
[CHIKA]
Good morning!

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,666
And goodbye!

20
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,083
[RIKO]
You're up early!

21
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,458
[CHIKA]
Morning! I'm headed out now,

22
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,708
I hope everyone
has an awesome day!

23
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:55,583
That's weird.

24
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,125
[SHIITAKE barks]

25
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:00,000
I wonder if it's
going to rain today.

26
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,583
[CHIKA humming]

27
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,791
Chika seems like
she's in a good mood.

28
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,416
How is that possible?

29
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,541
Maybe she forgot what today is.

30
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,166
She must have, or she'd
never be this calm.

31
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,291
You think so?

32
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,291
Hey, Chika.

33
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,500
[CHIKA]
Yeah?

34
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:20,333
So uh, do you happen
to know what today is?

35
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:21,791
[CHIKA]
Hm?

36
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,208
The day they
announce the results

37
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,166
from the Love Live
qualifiers, right?

38
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,041
[GIRLS]
Huh?!

39
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,250
We thought you'd plum forgot!

40
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,125
But, aren't you nervous Chika?

41
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,625
No! I'm not!

42
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,916
Because, in the end
we were all together.

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,416
We were able to put on
such a beautiful show!

44
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,125
I just know we passed.

45
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,750
Actually, I talked to Sarah
about it yesterday.

46
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,833
As far as I can tell, you'll
prob'ly be the top-ranked group.

47
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,041
You really think so?

48
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,500
Yep.

49
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:47,833
Seriously?

50
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:51,125
Wow, I had no idea the
two of you were so close.

51
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,458
It's here!

52
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,791
[GIRLS gulp]

53
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,833
[HANAMARU]
I'm so nervous, zura!

54
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,791
[RUBY]
Okay, here goes.

55
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,333
[GIRLS gasp]

56
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,791
[RIKO] Wait, does this mean
we were the top ranked group?

57
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:07,375
See?

58
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,708
Hooray!

59
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,500
Celebration hugs all around!

60
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,916
[YOSHIKO]
High-five, girl!

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,791
[YOSHIKO, MARI]
Woo!

62
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,875
You get it, <i>bella</i> !

63
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,125
[CHIKA]
Wanna high five, Dia?

64
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,250
[CHIKA]
I don't know what to do.

65
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,250
Again?

66
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,708
[RIKO]
What is it this time?

67
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,375
[CHIKA] Well, you know
how we just performed

68
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,125
in two events back-to-back?

69
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,875
Because of that
we're kinda broke.

70
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,250
[KANAN] But didn't we all just
pitch in a thousand yen?

71
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,750
[RUBY]
Shows are expensive.

72
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,458
Wait, are you sayin'... that
we're basically outta money?

73
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,291
Meanin' there's only one way
to make it to the finals.

74
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,500
Okay!

75
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,833
Are you ladies ready
to set sail for Tokyo?

76
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,708
[GIRLS]
Yeah!

77
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,291
Travelin' by swan boat.

78
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,333
What if we sink?

79
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,500
How much money is there?

80
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,833
[MARI]
Wow!

81
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,875
Such a shiny coin!

82
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,000
[RUBY]
Oh no.

83
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:37,916
[KANAN]
Five yen?!

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,291
[YOU]
Maybe it's a lucky coin?

85
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,666
[MARI]
<i>Fortunato</i> !

86
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,208
[YOSHIKO]
This is serious!

87
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,625
Hey, is something wrong?

88
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:45,958
[DIA]
No.

89
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,666
[DIA] I just didn't realize
that Mari and Kanan

90
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,125
had become so close
with the underclassmen.

91
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,375
[HANAMARU]
Well, girlfriend?

92
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,666
Got any ideas?

93
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,916
[KANAN]
Let me think.

94
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,541
What now?

95
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,041
"Girlfriend"?

96
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,166
[KANAN] Are we seriously
asking the gods for help?

97
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,041
[RUBY]
Yeah, why not?

98
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,250
It couldn't hurt to ask, right?

99
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,291
[CHIKA] Please increase
our money five-fold.

100
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,250
No, ten-fold!

101
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,625
Wait, a hundred-fold!

102
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,750
You realize that's
still not much money.

103
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:12,916
[CHIKA]
Oh...

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,166
[gasps] Feel that?
A spiritual presence!

105
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,250
There's nothin' here, silly.

106
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,791
Hold up, how would you know?

107
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:22,958
Forget gods.

108
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,125
Perhaps what we really
need is a goddess.

109
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,791
[GIRLS]
Goddess Mari!

110
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:30,166
No, you can't sweet talk me
into asking my dad!

111
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,458
[CHIKA]
Are you sure?

112
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,541
[GIRLS laugh]

113
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,791
Goddess... Mari?

114
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,791
[CHIKA]
Toodle-oo, Kanan-roo!

115
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:38,833
[HANAMARU]
Bye-bye, girlfriend!

116
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,666
See you at school
tomorrow, zura!

117
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,750
[KANAN]
Later!

118
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:45,000
[RUBY]
Don't take too long, okay, sis?

119
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,500
[MARI] So, what did you
wanna talk to us about?

120
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,958
[DIA]
Me?

121
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:52,541
Uh, well I suppose it's not
really that big of a deal.

122
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,958
I just couldn't help but
notice how buddy-buddy

123
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,750
you two have become.

124
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,083
[KANAN]
Buddy-buddy?

125
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,541
Me and who?

126
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,208
Kanan?

127
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,583
[PORPOISE cries]

128
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,041
Not with each other.

129
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,333
I meant with the first
and second year students!

130
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,208
[MARI]
Huh?

131
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,375
[KANAN]
Oh, I get it now.

132
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,750
Dia's jealous!

133
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,500
[PORPOISE cries]

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,666
What? I'm not jealous!

135
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,666
Besides, as the
student council president,

136
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,541
I cannot afford to act so casual
with the underclassmen.

137
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,791
[KANAN] Why do you always
have to be so stubborn?

138
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,333
[MARI]
<i>Tipico</i> Dia.

139
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,916
I just...

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,125
[BOTH]
Go on.

141
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,708
[DIA]
I just...

142
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,208
[PORPOISE cries]

143
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,375
Nothing, forget about it.

144
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,291
However, you two need to
start remembering that

145
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,541
you are upperclassmen and
should start behaving as such.

146
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,083
Something's fishy.

147
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:47,291
Smells like a
jealous fire rages!

148
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,083
[MARI] Whatever it is,
I'm sure Dia will

149
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,250
come to terms
with it soon enough.

150
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,458
She's always been a blockhead

151
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,500
when it comes to
her own feelings.

152
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,833
[KANAN]
That's for sure.

153
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,541
[GIRLS chattering]

154
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,791
I wonder what they
would nickname me?

155
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:05,958
[CHIKA]
Part-time job?

156
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,083
[RIKO]
Yeah, we don't have much choice.

157
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,000
[RIKO, CHIKA, YOU sigh]

158
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,666
[DIA]
Oh?

159
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,833
Is something troubling you?

160
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,083
Uh, hello.

161
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,666
Are you looking
for the bathroom?

162
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,458
I'm fine, thank you!

163
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,708
Uh, anyway.

164

What are the three of you up to?

165
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,625
Not much.

166
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,208
We were just looking
for a part-time job,

167
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,208
like at a store or
delivering papers, maybe.

168
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,666
[DIA]
In that case,

169
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,916
Numazu might be a good place
to start the job hunt.

170
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,625
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.

171
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,750
There is a lot of work there.

172
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,125
Like café jobs!

173

Hello and welcome!

174
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,291
I'll be your server today.

175

[YOU]
Or work as a florist.

176
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,541
Yes, ma'am!

177
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,708
This is the prettiest flower
we have in stock right now!

178
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:48,333
[YOU] If we're really lucky, we
could even get jobs as models!

179
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,708
The camera loves you!

180
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,875
Oh wow,
that would be so awesome!

181
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:54,750
For real!

182

[YOSHIKO, HANAMARU gasp]

184
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,875
Boop boop!

185
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:00,708
Wrong again!

186
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,125
It'll never be that simple!

187
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,458
Even part-time work
is still challenging.

188
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,958
The normal work shift
is at least

189
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,000
four days a week or more,
including weekends,

190
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,666
which would make practicing
together extremely difficult!

191
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,916
Even if you made the shift work,

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,125
it wouldn't be as great
as you're imagining.

193
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,208
Think things through!

194
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,416
[RIKO] As usual, President Dia
makes a good point.

195
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,750
[CHIKA]
Dia's so mature!

196
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,833
[YOU] Guess that rules out
the fun stuff though.

197

[CHIKA] Any other ideas,
Madame President?

198

[KANAN]
The flea market, huh?

201
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,333
[DIA] I thought it'd be a
good way to make some money

202
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,208
without using up
too much of our time.

203

What a great idea, sis!

204
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,833
[HANAMARU] For sure!
It's easy to see why you're

205
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,291

206
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,666
[YOU]
You really saved us!

207
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,708
Well, it was nothing, but

208
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,458
I agree.

209
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,625
As a token of thanks,

210
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,875
please accept this
fallen angel's feather.

211

[DIA]
All right!

213
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,583
Now all I have to do
is get closer to them

214
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,208
and gain their trust!

215

are you celebrating for?

[CHIKA]
Hm?

247
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,458
That was abysmal.

248
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,333
We are here because
we need to make money

to fund our club activities.

We have to be more firm
on our prices,

or we will never get anywhere!

a thousand yen for this?

Watch and learn.

Unfortunately, ma'am,

257
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,458
considering how much
the item originally cost,

258
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,625
I'm gonna have to
boop boop a lower price.

Um, why's that?

Frankly speaking, even though
these items aren't brand new,

they've barely been used at all!

In order to sell these things,

263
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,791
we had to clean them
carefully, one by one.

264

They were once our
dearest treasures, and yet,

even at the current price

we're practically
giving them away to you!

point at the customers.

You know, it's a little funny,

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,625
Laugh at what?

326
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,208
We're your friends,
we won't laugh at you!

Promise?

328

Aw, jeez.

329
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,833
After everything we've
all been through together?

330
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,208
[DIA]
Okay, I'll tell you.

[KANAN, MARI giggle]

334
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,333
So, the way you've
been behaving lately.

335
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,958
Is because you want the others
to call you girlfriend?

336
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,291
[MARI, KANAN giggle]

337
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,541
Like I've already
told you both countless times,

338
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,000
I don't care what they call me.

339
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,958
But they seem friendlier
with you than with me.

340
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,791
Stop stressing.
It's no big deal.

341
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,541
It most certainly is!

342
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,041
What if there's a huge crater
forming in our group?

343
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,041
We need to be proactive about
closing it before it gets worse.

344
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,125
So, you're <i>geloso</i> .

345
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,833
I am not <i>geloso</i> !

346
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,958
[MARI]
Stubborn as always.

347
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,416
[DIA]
More importantly,

348
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,291
why did you ask me to come
to this place today anyway?

349
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,291
[KANAN] Oh, I can't believe
I forgot to tell you.

350
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,875
[MARI]
We got a text from You.

351
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,333
She managed to get us all
a temporary job for the day.

352
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,583
We're supposed to help out
at a special event.

353
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:57,916
[DIA]
Oh? And where is this event?

354
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,583
[KANAN]
Right Here.

355
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,583
[DIA]
Really?

356
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,500
[KANAN]
Yep, and we'll be working

357
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,125
pretty closely together all day.

358
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,458
[MARI] This is your chance to
get closer to the underclassmen

359
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,833
and earn that nickname!

360
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,833
My very own... nickname?

361
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,541
Well, who cares?

362
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,666
I couldn't care less what the
other girls wanna call me.

363
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,083
<i>Sì</i> , so you say.

364
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,833
But the truth is written
all over your face.

Huh? Was that You?

369
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,375
Where is she?

370
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,458
[YOU]
Over here.

371
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,458
[CHIKA]
Whoa! She's a walrus.

372
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,166
[YOU] To start with, we're all
gonna work in groups of three.

373
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,583
[GIRLS]
Right!

374
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,750
Wow, look at that.

375
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,666
You seems like she's
right at home here.

376
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,583
Actually, she did say
she's worked here before.

377
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,250
Now, we'll need to split up

378
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,458
if you're going to get
closer to the other girls.

Yep, so hurry up, <i>bella</i> !

We need another order of udon.

my thing though.

[MARI] Like I said, you can
come off as a little obstinate.

391
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,958
[KANAN] Try starting off
with some small talk

392
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,291
to get things rolling.

393

I can do this.

Yes?

weather, am I right?

mad about something, zura!

look angry all the time?

on food duty, sis.

Oh.

I was, but since
the lunch hour is over,

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,833
it's not as busy anymore,
so I came here to help clean up.

What's with the bucket of fish?

414
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,000
It's food for the sea lion.

Yeah, we get to feed it,

416
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,541
and the trainer even
loaned us her whistle.

00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,416
Be careful.

485
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,875
Someone could get hurt.

486
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,750
[CHIKA, HANAMARU]
Right.

487
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,708
My sister's acting weird?

488
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,000
Yeah, she seemed
really upset earlier.

489
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,791
Actually, I noticed it as well.

490
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,958
I wonder if
something bad happened?

491
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,541
[YOSHIKO]
How naive.

492
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,958
Obviously, she has the smile of
someone possessed by darkness.

493
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,291
[YOU] Well, we can probably
rule out possession.

494
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,208
What do ya think?

495
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,541
We don't really have a choice

496
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,875
but to clue them in
to the situation.

497
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,291
Call her... girlfriend?

498
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,666
[BOTH]
Mm-hm.

499
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,291
The reason she's
been acting strange

500
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,000
is because she's been trying
all day to get closer to you.

501
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,291
[RUBY]
Now it makes sense.

502
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,250
[HANAMARU] So then
that creepy smile was just

503
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,916
Dia tryin' to be friendlier?

504
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,041
[RIKO]
I'm more shocked to find out

505
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,250
that she has such
a cute side to her.

506
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,083
[YOU] She could have just
told us what she wanted.

507
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,166
I know.

508
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,625
Anyway, she's always
been like this.

509
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:27,125
Even back when we were children
in elementary school.

510
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:32,166
She's serious, well-behaved, and
has always been very eloquent.

511
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,666
But because of that,
we couldn't help but feel like

512
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,291
she was above us.

513
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,500
[MARI]
Since we all felt that way,

514
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,791
she felt like she
should act that way.

515
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,916
Without meaning to, she
distanced herself from everyone.

516
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,041
[KANAN] Deep down, I think
Dia is just very lonely.

Don't run, please.

This is terrible!

00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,666
At this rate,
someone's bound to get hurt!

come to the stadium! Ha, ha!

[DIA] Listen, children,
if you run and yell,

540
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,041
you'll scare the animals

541
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,625
and could accidentally
hurt yourselves.

542

Is that fun?

Boop boop!
That's not fun at all!

No matter how much I try,
I can't change who I am.

For what it counts,

just the way you are, Dia.

Look, it's easier to goof-off
with Mari and Kanan

553

than it is with you.

You've always come off
