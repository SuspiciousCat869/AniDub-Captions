[GIRLS]
<i>Love Live! Sunshine!!</i>

3
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:16,458
[RUBY] We were practicing for
the Love Live Regional Prelims

4
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,833
when Yoshiko found a stray dog.

5
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,083
[RUBY] Except it
actually had an owner.

6
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,416
So, it's called Anko?

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,083
[RUBY] But Yoshiko had
some trouble letting go

8
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,375
because she believed destiny

9
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,208
had brought the
two of them together.

10
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:32,041
[YOSHIKO] If none of those
things actually exist,

11
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,541
things like destiny
or invisible forces...

12
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,916
[RIKO] I think
invisible powers do exist.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,250
Not just in you,
but inside everyone.

14
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,833
I just know it.

15
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,000
[RUBY]
Here we go!

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,125
[HANAMARU]
That place looks familiar, zura!

17
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,166
[YOSHIKO]
Indeed.

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,541
It appears to be
the promised land

19
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,541
where the last
Ragnarok took place.

20
00:00:56,625 --> 00:01:00,541
Last year we failed the regional
prelims, but this time...

21
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,375
We're gonna win!

22
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,166
Only 57?!

23
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,541
Yes.

24
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,875
As of right now we are up to
57 prospective students.

25
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:13,958
But that--that's less than ten
students added this month,

26
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,333
we need more!

27
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,250
Especially when you
consider the fact that

28
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:20,458
we have less than a month
to get it up to a hundred.

29
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,083
[MARI] The regional prelims
and the deadline

30
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,750
are on the same night.

31
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,833
If we don't have a hundred
prospective students by then,

32
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:29,833
then it's over,
there will be nothing we can do.

33
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:33,041
[KANAN] In other words,
the regional prelims are it.

34
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,041
[MARI]
Yes.

35
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,083
They're our last chance.

36
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,250
[DIA sighs]

37
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:42,250
So we're going to have to
stake our future on Love Live.

38
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,291
[MARI]
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4!


39
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,583
Change places!


40
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,875
Up! Up!

41
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,875
Oh, <i>bene</i> !

42
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,833
It's important that your arms
look the same, you know?

43
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,125
Hanamaru, bring your arms
up a bit more.

44
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,208
Perfect!

45
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,958
Try to remember
that position next time.

46
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:34,833
Zura.

47
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,291
Right, let's take a quick break,

48
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,291
then we'll start on
individual stuff.

49
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,416
[GIRLS sigh]

50
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,791
[HANAMARU] I don't think
I'm gonna make it, zura.

51
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,416
--[GIRLS chattering]
--[RUBY] Are you okay, Hanamaru?

52
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,666
--[GIRLS chattering]
--[HANAMARU] Zura.

53
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,583
[YOU] Whoa! There's a
prediction list online

54
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,208
for which idols will
make it to Love Live.

55
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,375
Check it out!

56
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,208
What's that?

57
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,083
[CHIKA]
No way, for real?

58
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,625
That sounds awesome!

59
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,750
[YOU] Since Love Live is so
popular, a lot of people try to

60
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,000
predict who they think
will make it to nationals.

61
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,666
Which groups are on the list?

62
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,083
Good question.

63
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,958
Naturally the groups who
made it to nationals last year

64
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,000
are on it, and...

65
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,416
Oh!

66
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,000
[CHIKA, RIKO, HANAMARU gasp]

67
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,833
"Saint Snow was the top ranked
group in last year's prelims,

68
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:15,458
and they even went on to take
eighth place in the final round.

69
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,125
The older sister, Sarah,
is a third year.

70
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,875
So you can bet she's
in it to win it."

71
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,708
No kidding, I'm sure
they're both pretty fired up.

72
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,416
Let's see...

73
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,666
It's Aqours!

74
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,541
[GIRLS gasp]

75
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:28,958
Are you kidding?

76
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:29,958
[YOU]
Nope!

77
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,875
[HANAMARU]
We're really on there!

78
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:35,125
Hey, what are they
saying about us?

79
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,416
[YOU] "Although Aqours didn't
pass the last regional prelims,

80
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,250
their performance in
the qualifiers this year

81
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,875
was truly amazing.

82
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:45,416
It was on par with the groups
who went to nationals last year.

83
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,875
We can't wait
to see their growth."

84
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,750
[CHIKA]
Our growth?

85
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,041
[YOSHIKO chuckles]

86
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,375
Have no fear, if I use
the forbidden powers

87
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,416
bestowed upon me
as a fallen angel,

88
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,208
passing the prelims
is but a trifle!

89
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,291
[RIKO]
Yes!

90
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,375
They are just a lowly hurdle!

91
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:02,750
[gasps]

92
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,125
Excellent!

93
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,500
As I'd expect from one who's
made a contract with me!

94
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,166
Good work, Lili the Demon!

95
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,666
How dare you!

96
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,583
As if I would ever make a
contract with the likes of you!

97
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:14,958
Yeah, that's weird.

98
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,083
Who's Lili?

99
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,625
They've both fallen far.

100
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,083
Yep.

101
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,458
No! Look, I know it sounds
weird but I swear it's not!

102
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,708
Welcome to the Hellzone!

103
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,958
[RIKO]
The what?!

104
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,791
[CHIKA] Angels of a feather,
flock together!

105
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,958
[RIKO]
It's not like that, Chika!

106
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,708
Hey, so it says for the prelims

107
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,750
groups going on to nationals
will be determined

108
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,583
by votes at the site and online.

109
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,083
That's fine by me!

110
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,916
At least we won't have to
wait to hear the results.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Unfortunately,
it won't be that simple.

112
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,458
[MARI] Each school's student
body will be at the prelim site

113
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,291
to root for their
school idol group.

114
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,083
[RUBY] Even though
there's still internet voting,

115
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,875
schools with more students
will have an advantage!

116
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,750
[HANAMARU] Wait,
so what you're sayin' is...

117
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,791
[DIA] Yes, because of
our lack of students,

118
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,208
we're at huge disadvantage.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,208
[MARI] You know, that may
solve our problem.

120
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,750
[MARI, DIA giggle]

121
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,666
[DIA]
Yeah, you're right.

122
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,333
[MARI]
That takes me back.

123
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,166
You kept it, huh?

124
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,375
Wow.

125
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,125
And let me guess, you wanna
try that move again?

126
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,291
Maybe.

127
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,958
I'm guessing you
don't wanna try that move?

128
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,708
Things are getting
desperate, Kanan.

129
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,000
We have to try, at least.

130
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:45,875
But...

131
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,291
[MARI]
Listen.

132
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,500
If you think my feelings
have changed, they haven't.

133
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,708
Mari.

134
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,291
I know this might
sound outlandish,

135
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,000
but I agree with her.

136
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,750
We have to take chances.

137
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,166
Especially if we're
going to save the school.

138
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,541
At least, that's my opinion as
the student council president.

139
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,708
More importantly,
this may be our only shot.

140
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,250
[KANAN]
But, it doesn't have to be this.

141
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,000
We could do something else.

142
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,333
[MARI]
Why not this?

143
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,041
We were so close last time!

144
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,000
We almost had it.

145
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,000
Close doesn't count.

146
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,791
And worse, you got hurt
in the process.

147
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,416
Look, it was my own fault
I got injured.

148
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,833
I was trying to
catch up with you

149
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,875
and I wasn't being
careful enough.

150
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,041
It happens.

151
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,791
Besides, things are different.

152
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:35,000
Now there are
nine of us in Aqours.

153
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,916
[KANAN]
No, it's not safe!

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,958
We tried to reach
what we couldn't reach,

155
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:44,041
and because of that,
someone got hurt.

156
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:47,083
And now, you want to
push that on everyone else?

157
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,958
We can't!

158
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,041
Mari!

159
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,916
[MARI gasps]

160
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,958
[MARI giggles]

they're very precious to me.

That's why I want
to see this through.

168

I want the Aqours
that we used to dream about

[CHIKA] Yeah, so out of
all the groups competing,

No wonder you're worried.

You'll just have to
give a knockout performance.

garner enough votes that way.

[LEAH]
Oh hey, sis. Bath's free.

180
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,916
It's obviously more than just
singing and dancing well.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,958
In fact, most of today's idols
are talented.

They can sing and dance
at the same level

as the past champions.

184
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,291
And yet, they don't believe
that they're equals,

185

even though they're
just as good.

186

There's a unique radiance
surrounding the pioneers

making Love Live popular.

I'm not sure that that light
is possible for us to reach.

[CHIKA] So it's...
an unreachable radiance?

[RUBY, HANAMARU]
Hm?

[CHIKA]
Mm-hm.

More specifically, what does
it mean to walk our own path?

What makes our radiance unique?

Competing in Love Live

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,041
the answer to that
is very important.

And yet, I don't know.

198
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,666
I can't put it into words.

199
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,083
Because they haven't
taken shape.

200

Anyway, for them to take shape--
that's what I want.

Yeah.

202
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,541
Well, Kanan, after hearing
a speech like that,

Mari actually hurt her leg
trying to learn how to do it.

Plus, it's a lot of work
for everyone involved.

223
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,583
What's the point in
trying something so risky?

224
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,083
[CHIKA]
Why not?

225
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,333
Please, Kanan!

226

When are we gonna do it
if we don't try it now?

227

everything we have!

we possibly can!

from the person in the center.

In order for Aqours to make
a breakthrough and truly shine,

00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,625
It's like I said.

322
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,458
I understand how she's feeling.

323
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,000
Same here.

324

[RIKO] You see, she used to be
the "normal monster."

Come again?

326
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,541
The normal monster, Chika-chi.

327
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,125
Everything about her is normal.

328
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,416
She's always watching
the sparkling light from afar.

329
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,000
So she says.

330
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:59,166
The truth is that
she has an incredible power.

331

[YOU] Even though she says
she's nothing special,

and that she's always
on the sidelines.

[RIKO]
After all this time,

334
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,708
Chika wants to try and
make it work on her own.

335
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,166
She's tired of watching.

336
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,833
She's ready to change things.

I didn't know you were up.

[RIKO]
Hello, Shima.

345
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,958
Where's Chika?

346
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,208
She said she wanted to get in
a little more practice.

347
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,791
Practice?

348
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,833
Really, at this hour?

[RIKO]
Chika.

353
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
She said that if she told you,

354
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,375
you'd probably
try to stop her.

355
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,541
Sorry Riko.

356
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,000
It's fine.

357
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,916
But I can't believe she's
still practicing like this.

358
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,750
Probably 'cause of
what Kanan said.

[KANAN]
Chika, promise me.

360

If you can't do it by tomorrow
morning, I want you to give up.

361

I know you've worked hard,
but you're at your limit.

Are you serious?

[YOU] I mean, she was in
Chika's position two years ago.

thank for getting this far?

The townsfolk, the school,
Aqours, both of you, and--

the most important person.

I became a school idol.

and the rest of us.

always try our best.

We've aimed for the
greatest heights together.

all of those feelings.
