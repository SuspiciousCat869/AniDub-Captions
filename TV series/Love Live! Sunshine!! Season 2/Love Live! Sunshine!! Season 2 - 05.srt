[GIRLS]
<i>Love Live! Sunshine!!</i>

3
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:16,416
[KANAN] We passed the Love Live
Qualifiers with flying colors,

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,125
only to realize that our
club funds were running low.

5
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:22,250
Additionally, something seemed
to be troubling Dia as well.

6
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,500
So the way you've
been behaving lately.

7
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,166
Is because you want the others
to call you girlfriend?

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,625
[KANAN]
But no matter what she tried,

9
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,083
Dia's wish just
wouldn't come true.

10
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,250
[CHIKA] For what it counts,
I happen to think you're awesome

11
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,375
just the way you are, Dia.

12
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,166
[DIA] I don't care about
the nickname thing, you know!

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,666
Dia's fine.

14
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:49,166
Wow, it's really
coming down out there.

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,458
Yeah, I heard it's only gonna
get worse as the day wears on.

16
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,625
In that case, I suppose
we will have to make this

17
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,250
our stopping point.

18
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,416
But the regional prelims
are coming up.

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,875
Plus we just hit
the halfway mark

20
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,708
on our prospective students.

21
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,791
I get not wanting slow down
when we're on such a good roll,

22
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,583
but our safety
has to come first.

23
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:08,500
Here!

24
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,125
What's this for?

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,500
"Good things come
to those who warm."

26
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,166
Isn't that what they say?

[GIRLS sigh]

28
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,958
[CHIKA] Kanan and Riko
are both riding with me.

29
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,625
Hey You, you wanna go with us?

30
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:23,916
Yes, please!

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,333
Need a ride, Yoshiko?

32
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:28,583
Storms stir the very soul
of this fallen angel.

33
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:31,083
Within these wings,
a hidden power is born!

34
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,375
[CHIKA] Cool, have fun
getting rained on!

My base lies not far from here.

Should the worst befall me,
I can always teleport there.

37
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,291
I guess it is pretty close.

See you tomorrow!

[YOSHIKO]
A wicked sky is churning.

41
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,166
It's as if some sort of final
battle is about to commence.

Halt! Halt, I say!

What's this? How peculiar.

48
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:12,625
Could it be... is a higher force
attempting to guide me?

49
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,291
[YOSHIKO]
Ha!

00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,375
It's fine. I know
you can do this!

Oh, sorry.

60
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,833
Riko saw the dog and thought
she would try petting it.

Wow, really?

I won't do it,
you can't make me!

You know what?

68
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,958
I get the feeling that
Shiitake actually

69
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,125
loves and trusts you, Riko.

70
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,166
Well, that's not
the message I'm getting!

71
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,708
I'm being serious.

72
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,625
It's a fact that dogs
have great instincts

73
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,958
for knowing whether someone
is a good person or not.

74
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,750

[KANAN] Look, we're
down to the wire here.

00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,041
It's time we all
made a decision.

79
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,458
But it's tough, zura.

80
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,791
It's just hard to pick
a good theme, y'know?

81
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,083
While I agree,

82
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,250
I simply can't get behind
the "darkness" idea.

[YOSHIKO]
Why not?!

84
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,041
Darkness is so perfect!

85
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,625
Everybody knows that
fallen angels and darkness

86
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,958
are simply meant to be
together for--

87
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,583
How about we go with "radiance"?

88
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,000
You could let me finish!

89
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,416
Well, to be fair,

90
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,125
"radiance" is a theme that
Chika has wanted to chase

91
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:35,416
ever since she first became
an idol and started Aqours.

92
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,708
That's true, but if we
really want to broaden

93
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,250
our potential as school idols,

94
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,166
then we'll need to
explore multiple options.

Whoa! No way, is that
video of Saint Snow?

If we want to go to nationals,

98
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,250
we can't get hung up
on just one idea.

99
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,583
Maybe we should try and
shake things up a bit.

100
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,625
Yeah, you're right.

101
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,208
Our next event
is regional prelims

102
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,041
which we failed last time.

103

Anyway, are you
planning on keeping it?

I guess not.

Unfortunately, pets aren't
allowed at my place.

[RIKO whines]

172

[YOSHIKO] It would
only be for a little bit.

to find the dog a new home?

Oh, I know!

Why don't you ask
either Hanamaru or Ruby?

They might help.

177

I can't.

178
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,958
Besides, their parents are
probably like, super strict,

179

Fetch the stick.

326
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,125
They're in sync?

327
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,125
I wonder what could've
gotten into them?

328
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,500
Perhaps they've
both been possessed

329
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,125
by an agent of darkness, zura.

330
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,916
That's a pretty good
Yoshiko impression!

You're amazing, Hanamaru!

Quite right.

337
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,833
Yes! I will sing and dance
to my heart's content,

338
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,375
casting off this
gloomy shadow forevermore!

339
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,041
Or nevermore.

340
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,458
[sighs] Don't get me wrong,

341
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,875
I'm glad we were able
to return the dog but...

342
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,958
No, I refuse to accept this!

343
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,166
Huh?

344
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,708
When you really think about it,

345
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,083
there's no actual proof that
says that she's the dog's owner.

346
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,000
Let's just say
she did have a dog,

347
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,125
there's a strong possibility
it wasn't actually Lailaps.

348
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,750
In fact, it was probably a dog
that looks like Lailaps.

349
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,791
Come on, that's a
serious stretch.

350
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,375
We'll go get the dog back.

351
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,291
Wait, what?

352
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,833
I told you, that dog and I

353
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,666
have a contract of the
highest possible order.

354
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,083
One that was drafted by destiny.

355
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,166
That's beyond absurd, we can't
just take someone's dog!

356
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:36,875
Whatever!

[YOSHIKO]
Why are you following me?

359
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,333
Because...

360
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,541
...I guess I feel partly
responsible for this whole mess.

361
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,083
Just as I thought,
there's an unusual evil aura

362
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,583
emanating from this house.

363
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:55,750
Oh?

364
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,250
I think it looks
pretty ordinary.

365
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,291
[YOSHIKO]
Gasp!

366
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,875
I feel it!

367
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,916
I can sense Laelap's spirit on
the other side of this fence.

368
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,166
Hey Yoshiko?

369
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,750
Yohane!

370
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:12,125
[RIKO] According to this flyer,
it's actually... one house over.

[YOSHIKO gasps]

[RIKO]
Hm. Yep, this is the one.

373
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:16,708
Indeed.

374
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,125
I can feel it.

375
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,916
Isn't that what you just said
about the other house?

376
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,375
Uh, I was testing you!

377
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,583
I'll summon the dog!

378
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,250
Come out, come out, come on out.

379
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,500
Little demon Lailaps,
come to your master!

380
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,416
I command thee
to answer my summons.

381
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,541
Hello, so nice to
see you both again.

382
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,458
Uh... Hi there!

383
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,625
We uh, just wanted to say
have a nice day!

384

[YOSHIKO yells]

385

[RIKO]
Any sign of the dog?

386
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,458
An evil force must be
interfering with our reunion.

387
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,916
We have no choice.

388
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,500
No choice for what?

389
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,250
But to wait for it. Duh!

390
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,166
For real?

391
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,625
But that could take hours!

392
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,958
It's not like you
have to stay here.

393
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,333
And like I said before,

394
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,458
Lailaps is very special
to me, so I'll wait.

395
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,541
Still though.

396

Here, you want some?

402
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,166
I don't want it.

[RIKO]
You sure?

404
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,458
What made you
decide to come back?

405
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,875
The more I thought about it,
the more I realized

406
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,666
that I would regret missing
the dog if it does show up.

407
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,291
Just remember that I'm the one
who encountered it first!

408
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,833
Jeez, I know that, okay?

409
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,208
So what makes a destiny?

410
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,208
Whaddya mean?

411
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,541
[RIKO]
The dog.

412
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,625
[YOSHIKO]
You can't explain destiny.

413
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,291
[RIKO] I guess I hoped
for something different.

414
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,458
You think fallen angels...
are real maybe?

415
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,208
Huh?

416
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,875
The thing is,

417
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,583
I've always had terrible luck,
even when I was child.

418
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,916
For instance, whenever I go
outside, it rains, or I trip.

419
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,458
No matter what I do,
I just can't make things work.

420
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,583
So I thought maybe,

421
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,333
because I'm so
special or different,

422
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,708
that perhaps there was an
invisible power behind it all.

423
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,791
Hence the fallen angel thing.

424
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,125
That's right.

425
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,166
Don't get me wrong, I know
they don't really exist.

426
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,541
I figured it all out
a while ago.

427
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,208
So I try not to
talk about it in class.

428
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,458
Still though.

429
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:56,208
If none of those things
actually exist,

430
00:18:56,291 --> 00:19:00,041
things like destiny
or invisible forces,

431
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,333
then what caused it?

432
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,958
What led me there?

433
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:07,833
For once, it felt like there was
an invisible power at work.

434
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,125
For once, it wasn't just
some weird coincidence.

435
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,625
For once, I felt
like I was doing

436
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,291
exactly what I was supposed to.

437

[YOSHIKO] And for whatever
reason, I was happy.

I felt like trying again.

484
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,000
Huh?

485
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,083
Well the thing is,
I've been thinking about it

486
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,916
and maybe it's actually just
coincidences that don't exist.

487
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,208
I don't really follow.
I'm sorry.

Like, different people may carry

489
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,208
different feelings with them.

490
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,583
Those feelings are what
become an invisible power

491
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,333
capable of
bringing people together.

492
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,833
Maybe that's what destiny is.

493
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,250
[RIKO]
Everything means something.

494
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,708
It's invisible, but real.

495
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,750
[RIKO giggles]

496
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:19,250
[RIKO] All it takes,
is a little belief.
