1
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:17,541
[RUBY]
Are you nervous?

2
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:18,750
[LEAH]
Mm-mm.

3
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:23,875
[RUBY] It's strange,
but I feel surprisingly calm.

4
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,583
Maybe it's because
our sisters are here.

5
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:29,083
[LEAH] Of course
I agree with you there,

6
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,250
but there's
more to it than that.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,791
I've only come this far
because of you, Ruby.

8
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,125
Leah...

9
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,208
[BOTH] This song is dedicated
to someone special.

10
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,083
[HANAMARU]
A concert?


11
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,333
[YOSHIKO]
In Hakodate?


12
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,416
[RUBY]
Mm-hm.


13
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,833
Leah and I want to
hold a concert together,

14
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:27,708
kind of like a live, but made
specially for Sarah and Dia.

15
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,916
By yourselves?

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,666
Well, yeah, that's the idea.

17
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,375
Honestly though,
I'm not sure what to do.

18
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,666
I just thought maybe
it would help cheer Leah up.

19
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,416
How will you prepare for it?

20
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,250
I don't know...

21
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,541
Hey, sounds interestin'!

22
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,041
Uh-huh.

23
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,541
Wha--

24
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,708
I'd be happy
to lend y'all a hand!

25
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,083
Really?

26
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,958
Okay then, Leah and I
were planning on meeting up

27
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,500
to hash out the details.

28
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:53,500
Wanna come?

29
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,750
[HANAMARU]
Mm-hm!

30
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,333
Thanks, Hanamaru!

31
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,666
[HANAMARU] Hey Yoshiko, do you
wanna come and help out, too?

32
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,541
Uh, you're asking me?

33
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,416
[YOSHIKO chuckles]

34
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,958
I don't know,
my schedule is very booked.

35
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,000
After all, recruiting
more demons for my cause

36
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,083
is actually
quite time consuming.

37
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,791
I suppose I could
pencil you in though--

38
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,458
[YOSHIKO whines]

39
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,791
[YOSHIKO] Just kidding!
Wait for me, Zuramaru!

40
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,583
[knocking]

41
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,625
Hey, Leah?

42
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,083
I need to do
some grocery shopping,

43
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,125
could you...
watch the restaurant...

44
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,333
Mm?

45
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,416
[ALL gasp]

46
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,791
Look, no offense, but...
I thought you'd be alone.

47
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,291
About that, you see
Hanamaru and Yosh--

48
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,291
I mean, Yohane said that
they wanted to help us out.

49
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,625
I don't care.

50
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,416
Don't take this
personally or anything.

51
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,833
I'm just not a people person.

52
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,125
I get it, I'm actually
the same way, zura.

53
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,500
And Yoshiko is the
poster-child for solitude, zura.

54
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,791
It's Yohane!

55
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,625
I can't believe you
badmouthed me so casually.

56
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,791
"Zura"?

57
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,625
[HANAMARU] Oh, I guess you could
say that's a habit of mine.

58
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,541
For real?

59
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,041
Yeah, I know it's weird, zura.

60
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,791
By habit, she means
she says it constantly.

61
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,041
That's why she
used to shut herself

62
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,083
in the library with Ruby.

63
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:09,958
Seriously?

64
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,291
Uh-huh.

65
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,458
I wasn't too social till
last spring rolled around

66
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,500
and I met the rest of Aqours.

67
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,791
That makes sense.

68
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,041
I'm shy, too.

69
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,250
Like around school and stuff.

70
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,875
[RUBY giggles]

71
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,166
You should have seen Yoshiko
when she first started,

72
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,583
she wouldn't even come to class!

73
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,458
[YOSHIKO] She doesn't need
a play by play, Zuramaru,

74
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,375
and it's Yohane!

75
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,666
[RUBY]
We're sorry, Yoshiko!

76
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,291
[YOSHIKO] Now you're just
doing it on purpose!

77
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,750
[RUBY]
"I won't give into failure,

78
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,791
no matter what happens."

79
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,416
[HANAMARU] "I shall
stand on that summit

80
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,250
alongside the one I love,
and yell out in triumph

81
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,791
so all the world
may hear me roar."

82
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:45,791
What's that look for?

83
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,375
I told you
Sarah's usually the one

84
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,208
who composes all of our music!

85
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,708
But we haven't even
said anything yet!

86
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,208
Well look, this is
just my opinion, but...

87
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,375
...I feel like the song
is too straightforward.

88
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,583
You got a problem with that?

89
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,750
[HANAMARU] Anyway, it at
least gives us a good idea of

90
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,166
what kind of song
you wanna sing.

91
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,041
Don't worry, together
I'm sure we'll be able to

92
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,583
make a wonderful song.

93
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,958
I appreciate that,

94
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,208
but shouldn't you be
more worried about Love Live?

95
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,333
You don't really have time
to help write a song.

96
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,208
I know, but...

97
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,125
[rustling]

98
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,625
[HANAMARU]
Here's the thing!

99
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,541
This song is as important
to Ruby as it is to you, zura.

100
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,958
[rustling]

101
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,541
Talking to you and my sis
made me realize something.

102
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,666
I thought maybe if we
showed them that we can do stuff

103
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,583
on our own, then they
wouldn't have to worry about us.

104
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,333
They'd both be able to
graduate high school

105
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,958
with some peace of mind.

106

--[phone buzzes]
--[rustling]

107
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,250
[YOSHIKO]
Oh no, it's from Lili!

108
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,458
She wants to know where we are

109
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,791
and why we're not packed
to go back home yet.

110
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,208
[gasps] And she's
suddenly telepathic, too!

111
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,750
We lost track of time!

112
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,208
[LEAH]
So what are you gonna do?

113
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,250
[HANAMARU]
Well, we are on winter break.

114
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,541
[LEAH]
Meaning?

115
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,083
[HANAMARU]
Here's the plan.

116
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,541
[KANAN]
The three of you are staying?

117
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,833
You see, with poor Leah
being so down in the dumps,

118
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,541
we thought maybe she needed
some extra moral support, zura.

119
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,833
That's right! So we thought
we'd hang out for a few days

120
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,083
and try to cheer her up!

121
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,250
[RUBY]
Yeah!

122
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,791
But where will you stay?

123
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,750
[HANAMARU] Leah said her room
is big enough for all of us,

124
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,083
so we're gonna bunk with her.

125
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,541
That sounds super fun!

126
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,791
I have to agree.
Maybe we should stay as well.

127
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:15,083
[RUBY] Uh, well, the thing is,
her room's not <i>that</i> big.

128
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,791
[HANAMARU]
Not to mention, Leah's in a very

129
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,416
delicate emotional state
right now, so, y'know!

130
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,791
Oh, I see.

131
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,833
I'm really sorry, sis.

132
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,375
But I promise we'll be back
in just a couple of days.

133
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,708
[sighs]

134
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,416
Whatever.

135
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,125
It's not like I care
if you stay or not.

136
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,875
I think it's a good idea.

137
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,208
Yeah, 'cause I'm sure the first
years can connect with Leah

138
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,708
better than we could
anyway, right?

139
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,083
[CHIKA]
I'm glad we went on this trip.

140
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,333
[RIKO]
Me too.

141
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,041
And honestly,
I never really thought about

142
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,375
how hard other school idols
must be working

143
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,000
to prepare for Love Live.

144
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,458
Yeah, it's pretty
inspiring, right?

145
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,208
It's fun meeting others
who share your passion.

146
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,041
[DIA whines]

147
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,208
[sighs] Oh, Ruby.

148
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,750
[KANAN] Are you sure
you didn't say something

149
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,000
that ticked her off, Dia?

150
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,125
No, I would never!

151
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,333
Something wrong?

152
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,541
We're just fine, thanks! Ha, ha!

153
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,208
Let's be honest though, it was
pretty obvious those three

154
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,916
were hiding something from us.

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,541
<i>Sì</i> , it's weird they'd wanna
stay behind with Saint Snow,

156
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,541
am I right?

157

[MARI gasps]
Wait, don't tell me!

158
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,416
Sorry sis, but the truth is...

159
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,250
We are descending from Aqours.

Yeah, and now!

161
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:29,000
[ALL] Saint Aqours Snow
will be our new idol group!

162
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,208
Boop boop! Say it isn't so!

163
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,333
Please don't shout!

164
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,833
Jeez, calm down, Dia.

165

<i>Sì</i> , it's joke!

166
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,541
[CHIKA] I don't think
that's what's going on.

167
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,083
I think they're... prob'ly...

168
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,208
Probably what?

169

[CHIKA]
Hm...

170
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,666
Never mind.

171

be revealed soon enough.

[DIA]
No fair!

[RUBY]
So this your room, Leah?

174

Make yourselves at home.

00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,125
Just don't touch anything.

176

Whoa!

--[footsteps]

179
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,583
What did I just tell you?!

180
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,708
Is that a snow crystal?

181
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,916
It is.

182
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,041
My sister and I
used to try and catch them

183
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,916
back when we were little kids.

184
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,791
Then we decided we wanted to
form an idol group together.

185
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,500
At that point, we both knew
that a snow crystal

186
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,500
would be the perfect symbol
to represent us,

187
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,083
and that's how
Saint Snow was born.

188
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,333
[LEAH]
And yet...

189
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:34,083
...I ruined her
last chance at Love Live.

190
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,041
[RUBY]
It's very pretty.

191
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,625
Well, naturally!

192
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,791
Sarah's the one
who bought it for me.

193
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,583
That's why she's
better than your sister.

194
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,125
[RUBY grumbles] Whatever,
Dia has great fashion sense

195
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,833
and puts together super cute
outfits that look perfect on me!

196
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,375
Sarah's great too,
and her clothes are

197
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,958
so much cuter
than Dia's could ever be!

198

No, they are not!

--[RUBY] Uh...
--[LEAH] Right.

I've never seen Ruby

Yeah, it's kind of cool!

Oh, I'm sorry.

You can't imagine
how worked up this girl gets

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,625
when it comes to her sister.

Maybe, but...
you're that way too, Leah.

Uh, it might sound crazy,
but we actually have somethin'

really important to do and
the other members of our group

215

asked us to handle it.

We're very grateful
for your hospitality.

It's no trouble, in fact it's
a pleasure to have you here.

We'll do that.

See? That's how
it's done, ladies.

224
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,750
I can't believe my eyes.

225
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,958
Yoshiko was acting so normal!

226
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,291
It's Yohane!

227
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,375
Besides, one of us
had to act like a normal person

228
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,791
because if I'd
left it up to you two,

you'd have blown our cover!

Fallen angels happen to be
quite excellent at

231
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,041
blending into society.

232
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,583
Everyone has an
unexpected side, zura.

233

Um, you could at least
acknowledge my magical ability!

Uh?

[RUBY] I've always felt like
the other members of Aqours

238
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,500
thought I was kind of helpless,

239
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,791
but lately I wanted to show them
that I can be strong, too.

240
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,791
'Cause deep down,
I think we all possess

Um, what is?

The theme of the song,
of course!

they're staying longer?

They called earlier and said

247

they needed a little more time.

Seriously? Do you think
they're gonna

form a new school idol group
after all?

We had no choice!

there's no way they

00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:15,625
It'll be a school idol group
that you and everyone will love.

481
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,791
One that you'll
be proud to watch.

482
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,583
Wait and see!

483
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,500
Right.

484
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,208
[SARAH]
Not long ago,

485
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,625
Leah would have been too shy
to sing with someone new,

486
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,250
but lately she's really matured.

487
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,208
[DIA] I guess our sisters aren't
little kids anymore, are they?

488
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,791
[SARAH]
Nope.


489
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,041
[DIA]
They're spreading their wings,


490
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,750
and that's something
worth celebrating.


491
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:50,708
[DIA, MARI, KANAN] Next time,
"Finding a Way to Shine."
