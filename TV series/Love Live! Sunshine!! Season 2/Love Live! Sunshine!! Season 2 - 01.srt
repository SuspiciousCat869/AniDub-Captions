00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,000
[CHIKA]
Sometimes I wonder...

2
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:23,041
..what exactly makes
someone shine?

[CHIKA grunting]

5
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,333
[CHIKA]
I can almost reach it!

6
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,791
[CHIKA]
Just a little more!

00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,041

00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,958
Chika! Why aren't
you dressed yet?!

15
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:18,208
You're gonna be late!

16
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,166
[CHIKA whines]

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,250
[MARI]
Buon giorno, everybody!

18
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,958
I hope all of you are ready,

19
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:28,458
because the second
season starts today!

20
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,541
The second season...?

21
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:32,375
She means the second term.

22
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,583
Well, more importantly,
where the heck is Chika?

23
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,791
[RIKO] She's late of course,
but that's what happens

24
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,958
when she tries to get herself
up in the morning.

25
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,541
[YOU laughs]

26
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,541
Mari! Didn't I tell you to speak
more like a proper director?!

27
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,625
You were supposed to say,
"Please behave in a way

28
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,916
that is befitting of an
Uranohoshi student

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,708
and study hard!"
Any of that ringing a bell?

30
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,375
In a befouling way?

31
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:52,750
I said "befitting"!

32
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,041
Heh...

33
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,416
Still, it's hard to believe
how close we were.

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,083
I know, a little more and we
would have made it to Nationals.

35
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,416
Don't let it get you down,

36
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,333
there's no point in
dwellin' in the past, zura!

37
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,250
Wait!

[RUBY, HANAMARU gasp]

39
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,291
[YOSHIKO] Why is the prize for
participating a two-color pen?

40
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,333
[RUBY] I wonder if the prize
for making it to Nationals

41
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,541
is a three-color pen?

42
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,500
[HANAMARU]
It's the future, zura!

43
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:13,458
[YOSHIKO]
It's just a pen!

44
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:17,250
Shut up!

45
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,708
[MARI clears throat]

46
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:21,458
Now then, I think we
were all a little <i>depresso</i>

47
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,166
about not making Nationals.

48
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,500
[BOTH laugh]

49
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,791
But still, we managed to
change a zero into a one.

50
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,791
We couldn't have done that
without all of your help.

51
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,125
[YOU]
And...

52
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,375
[RUBY]
There's more!

53
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,916
We surpassed our goal,
and turned one into ten!

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,625
You got that right!

55
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,000
[DIA] On top of that,
we have more news.

56
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,500
[MARI] Earlier today they
made an announcement--

57
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,375
it was about the next Love Live!

58
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,125
[KANAN]
Love Live?

59
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,416
[RUBY]
Really?!

60
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,666
[DIA]
Yes.

61
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,125
Like the previous ones,

62
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,625
the next competition
will be at Akiba Dome!

63
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,000
You're late!

64
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,625
But better late than never!

65
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:01,083
[CHIKA panting]
About Love Live...

66
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,208
You made it!

67
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,416
What do should we do?

68
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,625
I think this one is
pretty obvious, ladies!

69
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,625
But Yoshiko is dying
to know, zura!

70
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,708
[RUBY]
Mm-hm!

71
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,041
Yohane!

72
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,208
[CHIKA]
I say... we enter!

73
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,750
We enter Love Live!

74
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,166
And this time we'll go further!

75
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,666
Transform that ten,
and make it a hundred!

76
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,791
Yeah, and then--

77
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,958
[STUDENTS]
And then?

78
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,958
I believe... that we'll all
finally be able to shine

79
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,083
in our own way. I know!

80
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,750
[STUDENTS]
We will all shine!

81
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,958
[KANAN]
1... 2... 3... 4...

82
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:13,541
Wow, your body is
super stiff, Yoshiko.

83
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,291
Are you stretching
like I told you?

84
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,708
[YOSHIKO]
It's Yohane!

85
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,375
[YOSHIKO groaning]

86
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,083
[KANAN]
Still not good enough.

87
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,000
Here, I'll push you.

88
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,208

is only temporary!

Wow, Hanamaru!

95
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,666
You've become really flexible!

96
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,083
[HANAMARU]
That's because I stretch at home

97
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,708
every single day!
I'm also doing push-ups!

98

See? Perfect form.

That was amazing!
I'm so proud of you!

105
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,875
Fantastico!

106
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,458
In what way?!

107
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,375
So we know where the next Love
Live is, but what about when?

108
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,625
I could be wrong, but I think
sometime in the spring.

109
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,166
Boop, boop! Wrong again.

110
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,083
There's something else we need
to focus our attention on first.

111
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:07,916
[RIKO, YOU]
Huh?

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,333
I can't believe you forgot.

113
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,458
We need to increase the number
of prospective students.

114
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,833
[RIKO]
Right, the school's open house.

115
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,375
[YOU]
Oh yeah.

116
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,333
[MARI] <i>Si</i> ! I've already
made an announcement.

117
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,708
This is the perfect opportunity
to put on a concert

118
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,541
for any participants
of the open house,

119
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,625
and then we'll show them all

120
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,625
exactly how wonderful
our school is!

121

--[CHIKA] Great idea!
--[DIA] Uh...?

super awesome! Heh!

[YOSHIKO] Did you get
lost in the bathroom?

124
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,625
We had to go ahead and
start practice without you.

[KANAN] Says the girl
who should be stretching!

Aw man, I forgot the bus service

130
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,708
stops running earlier
in the fall.

131
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,000
That's right, it does.

132
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,083
The sun starts
setting earlier, too.

133
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,416
Is it possible our practices
might get shorter?

134
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,250
On top of that,
the school's open house

135
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,708
is right around the corner.

136
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,166
[RUBY]
I know, so what do we do?

137
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,500
[DIA] We need maintain our
practice schedule somehow.

138
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,500
[KANAN]
Why don't we just start

139
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,041
two hours earlier
in the morning?

140

No, we were groaning!

143
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,750
Hold on a sec, Yoshiko.

144
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,958
Didn't I hear that you have
an earlier curfew these days?

But how the heck do you know?

147
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,541
[RIKO] Oh, actually,
I heard it from my mom

148
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:30,625
who was talking to your mom at
the last Love Live competition.

149
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,708
And so, in the name
of the fallen angel--

150
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,666
Yoshiko?

It's Yohane, Mom!

154
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,375
[RIKO] Wasn't it because you
locked her out of your room?

155
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,541
[YOSHIKO] Uh, that's because I,
Yohane, am a fallen angel!

156
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,833
That makes my parental unit
merely a temporary housemate.

157
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,916
Anyway, what do you think
her mom is like?

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,791
I heard she's a school teacher,

159
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,208
and I also heard that all
the way up to kindergarten,

160
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,666

let go of her ba-ba.

Hey wait.

163
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,875
I wonder if the buses that head
this way from Numazu run later.

[GIRLS groan]

165
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,708
Probably, because people
are coming back from work.

00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:12,708
Uh! What if we actually
practiced in Numazu?

167
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,166
With the later buses, we'd
have more time to practice.

What a great idea!

[RIKO] We could check out

It'll be the perfect opportunity

Hey, Riko?

Maybe it's silly,
but for a brief moment,

187
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,625
and I mean really brief.

188
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,416
I think singing together

[RUBY]
In that case,

[RUBY] Oh, I think Mari had
to go take a phone call.

You know Mari loves our school,

And for that reason,

the school's open house

Even though things didn't
turn out the way we hoped,

at least we can still be proud
