For real?!

[KANAN]
What is it, Mari?

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,833
It certainly didn't sound
like anything good.

5
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:23,833
It wasn't.

6
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,458
There's been a change of plans.

7
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,208
They're postponing
the open house.

8
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,208
No way!

9
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,541
Did they say for how long?

10
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,125
And more importantly,
why is it being postponed?

11
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:36,666
Well, from what I understand,
all of the recent rain

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,750
has caused them
road closures.

13
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,833
So, they're having to move
it back by one week.

14
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,500
Seriously? I guess it
makes sense, but still.

Of all the days it
could be moved to.

[CHIKA]
Alley-oop!

Why so glum, chums?

20
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,333
Look at the bright side, this
means we get a whole extra week

21
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:58,208
to practice and get even better!

22
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,125
I don't think you're
grasping the full extent

23

of our situation, Chika.

24
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:02,833
Here's a question!

25
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,166
[CHIKA]
Huh?

26
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,500
Tell me again, when are
the Love Live Qualifiers?

27
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,000
That's easy, they're
on the Sunday,

28
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,083
a week after the open house.

29
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,500
[RIKO]
Right, but

30
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,708
Mari just got a phone call
telling us that now

31
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,708
the open house has been
delayed by a whole week.

32
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:20,166
And the date for the Love Live
Qualifiers is still the same.

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,625
[RIKO, YOU]
So, keeping all of that in mind.

34
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,791
When are the events?

35
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,375
They're next Sunday, of course!

--Oh!
--Ow.

Are you okay?

41
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:39,208
They're both on the same day?!

[STUDENTS chattering]

43
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,000
[KANAN] This is the place
where they're holding

44
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,916
the Love Live Qualifiers.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,708
Really?

46
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,208
It's in the mountains?

47
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,458
Yes, that's correct,
and from what I've heard,

48
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,000
they've decided to set up a
special stage for the event.

49
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,583
How far's the school from there?

50
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,750
[KANAN] It's over here,
but there's no bus or train

51
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,291
that goes all the
way there, so...

52
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,500
[RIKO] What if we went here
first, and then switched trains?

53
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,916
[DIA growls] That's way too
complicated! It'll never work!

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,333
There's no way we'd make it.

55
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,125
If only we had the ability
to fly there.

56

[YOSHIKO chuckles]

57
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:45,458
[YOSHIKO] Then it's a good thing
you know a fallen angel, right?

58
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,208
Yeah, there's an option.

59
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,791
Exactly, we can just get
Yoshiko to fly us all

just kidding, okay?!

00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,000
Right.

[YOSHIKO] I'm serious about not
being serious, you got that?

[CHIKA]
No, she's right!

68
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,041
We could fly!

Huh...?

It's time to take off.

to our next event!

It's the future.

We'd really fly?

So! Read my lips.
This is all or nothing!

how 'bout the sea?

for business on Sundays.

Okay, for starters my dad's
boat is nothing like that.

Zura.

[DIA]
Realistically speaking,

114
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,708
there's no way we can perform
at the Love Live Qualifiers

115
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:49,083
and the school open house
in the same day.

116
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,583
But there's one chance.

What is it?

119

Well you see, it all depends
on whether we're the first

120
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,000
to sing at the qualifiers.

121
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,125
If we are, then there's
a bus we can take.

122
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,708
We'd be cutting it close,
but it'd get us to school

123
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,708
right before the open
house will begin.

Yes, but if we miss that
bus then the next one

isn't for another three hours.

In other words, if we aren't
the first performers,

128

then we'll miss our only
chance to make this work.

the performing order.

Don't patronize me and
don't call me Yoshiko!

My true power emerges

So now what?

Fine, if you insist on
being our group rep.

you'll spin for us.

Yeah, good job throwin'
out paper like that!

It's Yohane!

Did you do something just then?

And take flight,

What are we gonna do?!

Number 24 is, like
the worst place!

The middle of the event!

00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,083
Unfortunately, it is impossible
to fight the destiny

the fallen angels'

I'm so sorry!

206
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,500
It's not like you planned
for this to happen.

207
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,333
Still, one thing's for sure.

208
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,416
We have a big decision to make.

209
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,125
Perform at our school,
or the Love Live qualifiers?

210
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,250
You mean choose one
over the other?

211
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,125
We don't have another option.

212
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,166
[MARI] I think we should
choose the open house.

213
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,166
[KANAN] Me too, we can't
just abandon our school.

214
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,791
I suppose that's true, but...

215
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,208
What we need right now is to get

216
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,208
as many new students
as possible.

217
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,166
Wouldn't Love Live be the most
effective method for that?

218
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,833
There'd be more people
there than open house.

219
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,708
And it'll get attention.

220
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,208
That's a fair point.

221
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,666
So, what do we choose?

222
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,625
If you think we should
perform at the open house

223
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,500
raise your hand.

224
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:16,958
Okay, who thinks we should
perform at Love Live instead?

225
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,708
[sighs] We have to pick one.

226
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,208
[MARI]
I know, but...

227
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,708
[HANAMARU]
I can't decide, zura.

228
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,083
It's too hard.

229
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,375
[KANAN]
Chika.

230
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,458
Because, both things
are important.

231
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,416
They're both dear...
to all of us...

232

Ugh!

Come on, I need like a good idea
lightning strike or something!

Keep it down, Chika!

235

236
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,166
Look, I get how you're feeling,

237
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,958
but we have to choose
sooner or later.

238
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,791
Yeah, I know.

239
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,291
Which one do you think
we should pick?

240
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:05,291
I have no idea. I wanted
to perform in Love Live.

241
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,083
I wanted to see myself shine,

242
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,166
and that's why I became
a school idol.

243
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,541
But you could do that,
because of our school.

244
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,625
Because Uranohoshi was here.

245
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,375
Exactly.

246
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:20,458
[CHIKA groans] Why do both
have to be on the same day?

247
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,000
I wish I had two bodies.

248
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,166
You still can't choose, huh?

249
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,708
Nah. I'm useless.

maybe there is a solution.

254
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,541
Just a little brush with death!
You were saying?

255
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,958
Well in short,
we do have more bodies.

256
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,208
I mean, there are
nine of us, right?

257
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,250
Yeah. Nine of us.

258
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,541
[KANAN]
You want us to split up?

259
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,875
Yes. Five and four.

260
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,916
Then we can perform at both
the open house and Love Live.

261
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,458
It's our best shot, and maybe
the only choice we have.

262
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,458
Still though.

263
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,583
It's not very Aqours like.

264
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,833
Zura.

265
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,833
I'm more worried about
passing the qualifiers

266
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,041
with only five of us.

267
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,208
I know it's not exactly ideal,

268
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,750
but we don't really
have another option.

269
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,250
[YOU]
This doesn't feel right.

270
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,625
No, I agree.

271
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,208
But we had to at least make
some sort of a decision.

272
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,916
And it's not like we can
perform miracles.

273
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,416
We couldn't at the last
Love Live prelims,

274
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,250
or in the case of
the school merger.

275
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,416
Which is why we do
what we think is best,

276
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,041
and then try with all our might
to make things work.

277
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,625
In my opinion, that's what
makes Aqours special,

278
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:53,958
you know?

279
