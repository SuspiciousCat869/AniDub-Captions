The day before
the closing festival,

5
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,500
all of the girls at our school
pulled together

6
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,916
to make it the
best event possible.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,208
Oh wow, it's just Shiitake.

8

[CHIKA]
We were happy and humbled.

00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,125
It was such a warm experience.

10
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:32,333
If only we could
freeze that moment in time.

11

But, all good things
must come to an end.

12
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:39,375
And now, after a long journey,
we've reached our destination.

We're ready!

[YOU]
Do you have everything?

15
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,916
I think so.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,083
That festival was fun, huh?

17
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,208
[CHIKA]
Mm-hm. It was.

18
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:00,625
You know what?

19
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,583
We should channel that
positive energy into the finals.

20
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,375
Hi, Riko!

21

Hey, Chika.

22
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,708
I agree,
we've worked hard for this.

23
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,125
We have to give
Love Live our all.

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,000
[DIA] We practiced and put in
long hours every single day.

25
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,916
Early in the morning,
until the sun set.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,541
Yeah, we always did our Rubesty!

27

[KANAN] Rain or shine, we never
skipped a practice session.

whined about them.

29

[HANAMARU] It sure was hard

But yeah, I'm so proud
of my little demons.

33
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,333
I praise you all!

Are you okay?

38
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,666
Yes, I'm not scared anymore.

39
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,416
So, what should we do now?

40
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,666
The finals
aren't until tomorrow.

41
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,083
I'm pretty sure Lili
wants to go hit up Bukuro.

42
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,000
What?! Why would I go there?

43
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:54,875
Bukuro?

44
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,666
They have trashy books to buy!

45
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,125
Time for my
secret technique,

"Silent Cherry
Blossom Nightmare!"

turning into Yoshiko.

First thing's first.

It's super <i>belissimo</i> up here.

I forgot how many
stairs there were.

54
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,125
Yeah, but don't you think
it was easier to climb

55
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,416
this time around?

56
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,000
It was, huh?

57

Growth is often something you
don't notice until afterwards.

say "zura," zura.

Please let us bring joy
to all my little demons.

able to sing perfectly.

And convey the feelings
of everyone at Uranohoshi.

we'll give the best performance
we've ever given.

All of these school idol groups,

So this is it,
the Love Live finals.

If you show fear,
you'll lose tomorrow.

Um yeah, we know.

98
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,958
But it's Akiba Dome.

99
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,125
It'll be different
from other venues, zura.

100

Can't even imagine
what the place must be like.

It's unreal.

I still can't believe
I got to sing there.

It was so exciting.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,666
Everywhere I looked, there were
tons of lights sparkling.

105
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,250
It felt like we were floating
above the clouds somehow.

106

Above the clouds?

107
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,875
That's why,

108
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:36,375
I'm not gonna forgive you
if you put on a half-baked show.

109
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,916
I would never do that!

Yes!

[SARAH]
When I first met you,

116
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,375
I didn't think your group
stood a chance of winning.

117
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:55,458
But now, when I look at
the girls standing before me,

118
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,625
I see a group of
very promising idols.

so now it's my turn to ask you.

might be pretty good.

to start feeling anxious.

doubt we'll lose tomorrow.

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,416
Because, this is
where everything started.

327

[BOTH panting]

330
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,416
[CHIKA]
I hope we find it.

331
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,041
You know, the radiance that I
wanted to find way back then.

332
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,125
I am certain that you will.

333
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,208
In fact,

334
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,083
I think you'll find it soon.

335
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,750
Don't worry.

336
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,000
How about you?

337
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,000
[YOU]
Hm?

338
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,708
[CHIKA]
Do you wanna win?

339
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,375
Love Live?

340
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,875
[YOU]
Of course.

341
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,583
This is something
I was able to do with you.

342
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:43,458
So it's okay to be normal,
and to just be yourself.

343
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,583
You don't have to be
afraid of the future.

344
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,958
Because...

345
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,916
[YOU sniffles]

346
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,333
...you aren't alone, Chika.

347
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,458
We're with you!

348
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,875
Thank you, You.

349
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,500
Ah! Hey, Riko!

350
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,333
Did you play the piano?

351
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,125
[RIKO]
I sure did!

352
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,958
I wanted to ask,
do you wanna win Love Live?

353
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,250
[RIKO]
Mm-hm.

354
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,000
Honestly, in my heart,

355
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,375
I know this was the path
I was meant to travel.

356
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,375
I believe it a hundred percent.

357
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:21,750
You saved me, when I was scared
and running away from the piano.

358
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:26,458
Meeting you and the rest
of Aqours, it was a miracle.

359
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,208
So the answer is yes.

360
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,166
I want us to win Love Live.

361
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,375
I want to prove that I made
the right choice in the end!

362
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,666
I want to savor
this moment with you.

363
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,416
With everyone!

364
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,791
Because I want to
be a school idol!

365
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:45,833
[RIKO cries]

366

[GIRLS laugh]

367
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,666
[YOU]
N' you, Chika?

368
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,416
[RIKO]
What do you want?

369
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,208
[YOU]
That paper.

370
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,208
We turned a zero into a one.

371
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,083
It wasn't easy, but we did it.

372
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,750
And I... well I was just normal.

373
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,583
But being a normal monster?

374
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,666
That's how I became who I am!

375
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,125
I wanna to do my best
to win today!

376
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:16,125
I'm going win Love Live
and find my radiance!

377
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,291
There it goes.

378
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,291
Thank you.

379
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,916
I think we'll be okay.

380
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,583
Are you ready? Shall we go?

381
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,083
[CHIKA]
Mm-hm!

382
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,666
So what did you write
on your votive tablet?

383
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,416
Sorry, but that is a secret.

384
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,625
Although, I'm positive
what I wrote will come true.

385
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,458
And then it won't
be a secret anymore.

386
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,166
[MARI]
Speaking of,

387
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,250
remember back when I was
going to transfer schools

388
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,500
a few years ago?

389
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:55,333
Didn't you wish...
we'd be together forever?

390
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,500
See? I'm good at this.

391
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,041
Are you sure?

392
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,958
We're about to be
separated again.

393
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,000
[MARI]
We'll be together.

394
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,208
Because the entire
sky's connected.

395
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,041
No matter how far apart we are,

396
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,375
we'll still be together!

397
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,375
Even if our eyes can't see it.

398
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,166
[GIRLS laugh]

399
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,375
Now, let's get going!

400
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:25,958
Yoshiko?

401
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,500
It's Yohane!

402
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,583
So, there's something
I need to tell you.

403
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,375
You too, Ruby.

404
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,416
[RUBY squeaks]

405
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,250
[HANAMARU]
What's up, zura?

406
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,500
I should think
it's fairly obvious.

407
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:37,583
With our school closing

408
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,625
and the Love Live finals
happening today,

409
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,666
your contract with me--

410
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,291
[HANAMARU]
You don't have to worry.

411
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,833
We're not going to
break the contract

412
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,833
between you, me, and Ruby,
because it's absolute, zura.

413
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,541
Yeah, even after we're
at a new school.

414
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,375
[YOSHIKO]
Hmph!

415
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,958
Why are you saying
my line for me?

416
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,083
Thank you!

Yeah, I'm really grateful-uby!

My heart is totally racing!

420
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,666
[YOU] I bet the stage
is gonna be huge!

421
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,333
[RIKO] It's hard to
even imagine, isn't it?


422
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,708
[HANAMARU]
Zura!


423
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,333
[YOSHIKO]
Looks like we're right on time.

424
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,333
[RUBY]
Our next stop is the dome, huh?

425
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,000
I can't wait!

426
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,375
[DIA]
So, are you ready?

427
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,791
[KANAN]
Akiba Dome.

428
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,958
It's one of the biggest venues
in the whole country!

429
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,250
[MARI]
Love Live is finally here!

430
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,958
[CHIKA]
I wonder how far we've run.

431
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,125
I wonder how far we've come.

432
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,958
How far we'll continue to go.

433
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,583
I don't have the answers.


434
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,000
Everything we've done
and everywhere we've been,


435
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:47,750
it's all led us to where we are
right now in this moment.

436
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:51,541
Sarah said that Akiba Dome was
like being above the clouds!

437
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,958
Let's enjoy this
as much as we can.

438
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:58,458
Let's go all out,
and let's win Love Live!

439
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:02,041
In order to find our own
radiance and finally shine!


440
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,875
Are you ready?

Nine!

450

[CHIKA]
From zero to one!

451
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,958
And from one
to something greater!
