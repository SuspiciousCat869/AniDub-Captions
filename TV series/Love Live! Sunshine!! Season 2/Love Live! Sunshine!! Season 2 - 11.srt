[GIRLS]
<i>Love Live! Sunshine!!</i>

3
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:15,375
[DIA]
Here we go!

4
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:18,208
Mari turned down the director's
position at the new school.

5
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:19,916
[MARI]
I declined the position.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,125
I've decided I'm going to
attend a college in Italy.

7
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,375
[DIA]
After their graduation,

8
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,416
the third years will all
go their separate ways.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,833
So, they decided to
find a shooting star together,

10
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,083
like they did as children.

11
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,083
You thought the three of us

12
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,333
could do anything
together, right?

13
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,416
[MARI]
A star that's only for us?

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,583
Okay.

15
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:37,958
[DIA] Because a journey
taken with friends

16
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,208
will always be special.

17
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,750
[YOU]
Okay, a little more to the left.

18
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,583
[RIKO]
Chika, be careful with your end.

19
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,583
[CHIKA]
That should do it.

20
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,666
[RIKO] Now we just
need to secure this side.

21
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,791
[YOU]
Get ready!

22
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,583
[sighs]

23
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,166
All done!

24
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,416
It looks great.

25
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,000
Mm. A festival was
an awesome idea.

26
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,458
Let's get ready to party!

27
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,541
[YOU]
Aye-aye!

28
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:43,291
[MARI]
Yay, it's <i>finito</i> !

29
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:47,083
Behold my brand new
culinary masterpiece!

30
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,791
I call it Stewshine Premium!

31
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,000
I would really prefer that
you not use our club room

32
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,041
as a kitchen.

33
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,458
But Dia!

34
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,583
The masses are practically
demanding to eat my food!

35
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,250
Stop me if I'm wrong, but
isn't it typically frowned upon

36
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,416
for school directors to
run a shop during a festival?

37
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,791
Under normal circumstances, yes.

38
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,416
But since we're closing down,
there's no real harm in

39
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,541
the director jumping in
for a little fun!

40
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,666
I just wanna contribute
something special!

41
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,291
[sighs]

42
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,625
I'm worried about
the timing, you know?

43
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,333
The third term
is already so busy.

44
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,416
It's fine!

45
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,875
Besides,

46
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:24,541
this is what the students
at this school requested!

47
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,416
They wanna honor
Uranohoshi High.

48
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,750
Do what now?

49
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,083
We felt like we
had to do something!

50
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,833
So we talked it over
and came up with this idea.

51
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,291
It didn't seem right to combine
it with the graduation ceremony.

52
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,458
Exactly! If we're gonna go out,
why not go out with a bang?

53
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,333
Know what I mean?

54
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,916
Like boom!

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,083
Oh, and we can even invite
the whole community to come!

56
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,583
[MUTSU] Look, we know this is
a busy time for the third years

57
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,083
with college and all,

58
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,541
but this is our last chance.

59
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,666
Shiny.

60
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,291
Approved!

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,541
[ALL]
Huh?

62
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,125
[MARI]
You know,

63
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:07,958
it really is touching how much
the girls here love this school.

64
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:08,791
[door opens]

65
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,166
[CHIKA]
Heya, Mari!

66
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,333
All done!

67
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,333
The arch is set up
and ready to go!

68
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,708
<i>Grazie!</i>

69
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,750
For now, you can go back
to your normal preparations

70
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,208
until we need you again--

71
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,875
Actually, I think we need
to speed the prep up a bit.

72
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,625
At the rate we're going,
we'll never finish

73
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,916
before the end of the day.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,041
[ALL]
Yes, ma'am, leave it to us!

75
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,166
[MARI]
Ciao for now!

76
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,833
They seem really happy.

77
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,291
<i>Sì</i> , they're excited
for the festival.

78
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,125
I'm so proud of
our fellow students

79
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,041
for coming up with this event.

80
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,416
[DIA]
So basically,

81
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,291
we'll take everything
we've felt for this school,

82
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,791
all of our hopes and dreams,
and channel them into tomorrow.

83
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,000
Is that the idea?

84
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:46,916
Uh, yeah.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,750
In that case, then I've decided.

86
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:52,458
I shall put aside my position as
the student council president,

87
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,958
and focus my energy
on this festival!

88
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:55,958
[RUBY]
Hey, sis!

89
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,916
Everything looks
great over here!

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,541
If it's okay with you.

91
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,791
[MARI laughs]

92
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,000
[DIA]
Mm?

93
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,625
Oh jeez, we'll never
finish at this rate!

94
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,083
Where is Ruby?

95
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, when you're
as popular as she is,

96
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,500
you're in high demand, zura.

97
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,458
So I guess it's up to the
unpopular girls to work here.

98
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,708
What the heck does that mean?

99
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,500
Are those walruses?

100
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,375
I feel like we've seen those
somewhere before.

101
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,375
Whoa!

102
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,375
Oh, this is coming along nicely!

103
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,750
Oh! Hey, welcome back!

104
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,500
Cool, I didn't realize you were
helping out our class, Ruby.

105
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:36,708
[RUBY] Mm-hm. I've always wanted
to make this kind of costume.

106
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:37,916
See?

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,083
It's so cute!

You're very talented!

I think that might've been You.

Who's in the other suit?

You, wait up!

112

[CHIKA]
Weird.

113
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,541
Where'd they run off to?

114
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,708
Yeah, I'm almost positive
they came this way.

115
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,833
They disappeared?

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,333
Um, what was that?

118
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,666
Looked like a ghost.

[RIKO] Did you really see
the ghost come in here?

121
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah, at least I think I did.

122
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,000
Are you sure? It's dark.

123
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,166
Is the fallen angel
afraid of the dark?

Uh, absolutely not!

That thing?

Well, yeah. Although I suppose
it could just be a sheet?

to find out.

I'll try and fix it.

166
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,458
Do you really think
that will be enough?

167
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,375
And how will you do that
when it's almost time

How will we finish in time?

Good question.

You can stay.

[CHIKA] My family's specialty,

Mito brought it by
to apologize for Shiitake.

If dropping that leash results
in free delicious hot pot,

You girls went all out! Huh?

325
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,125
[RIKO] I can't believe
I'm doing this.

326
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,375
[CHIKA]
Riko?

327
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,583
Isn't she great?

328
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,708
Riko agreed to
help us out, zura!

329
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,000
Just what you'd expect
from the little demon, Lili.

330
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,250
[RIKO]
You agreed, too!

331
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,541
Weren't you the one
saying you wanted

332
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,750
to help Yoshiko's wish
come true for once?

333
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,666
[HANAMARU]
Uh, I didn't say that exactly.

334
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,875
Zuramaru.

335
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,125
Lili.

336
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,458
[CHIKA]
Ah!

337
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,041
Okay, I finally know
what I wanna ask you.

338
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,666
Please tell me.

339
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,750
What is the future of Aqours?

340
00:14:58,833 --> 00:14:59,791
[gasps]

341
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,208
I don't need special
powers to know that.

342
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,333
All of my little demons
are whispering.

343
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,416
And the future of Aqours is...

344
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,416
Hey! Come one, come all
for my famous Premium Stewshine!

345
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,708
[CROWD chattering]

346
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:22,916
Wow. That's a huge line. Uh?

347
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,416
Shima and Mito!

348
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,291
[SHIMA]
Hi Chika!

349
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,458
Hi, whatcha doin'?

350
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,041
Do you want one?

351
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,666
Oh! Grilled mandarin oranges?

352
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,166
These are so yummy!

353
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,625
They taste so awesome
this time of year, huh?

354
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,583
You've always been
a fan of oranges.

355
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,583
Isn't that right?

356
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,625
[CHIKA]
Mm! I love 'em!

357
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,500
Whenever I eat an orange,
I can't help but think,

358
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,541
"Ah, I'm so glad
I was born here."

359
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,958
I'm so happy!

360
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,416
It's kind of funny.

361
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,125
This old place hasn't changed,
know what I mean?

362
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,041
[MITO]
Right? It even smells the same.

363
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,250
[CHIKA]
Smells?

364
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,250
[SHIMA] Mm-hm.
Since you go here every day

365
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,083
you probably don't notice it,
but it has a particular smell.

366
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,500
Just a scent.

367
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,541
It's something that
brings back good memories.

368
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,416
[hissing]

369
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,708
You hear that too, don't you?

370
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:18,833
Where's it coming from?

371
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,958
Hey! Chika!

372
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,666
Can you come over here, please?

373
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,250
See ya!

00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,708
Yoshimi! What's up?

375
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,166
[YOSHIMI laughs]
It's a surprise!

376
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,291
What is?

377
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,333
See?

378
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:40,375
[CROWD]
Whoa!

379
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,500
Quick, come here!

380
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,208
What is it?

381
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,958
[ALL]
Yay!

382
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:58,000
[CROWD chattering]

383
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,958
Chika! You like it?!

384
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:06,791
Do ya?!

385
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,166
[CHIKA]
Mm! I love it!

386
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,875
[ITSUKO] Well then you're gonna
love this next part, too!

387
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:12,541
Huh?

388
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,833
[ALL]
One, two!

389
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:21,375
[CROWD]
Whoa!

390
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,375
[CHIKA]
It's true what people say.

391
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,208
Time flies
when you're having fun.

392
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,375
[KANAN]
Memories made with good friends,

393
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,833
it makes you wish you could
freeze those happy moments

394
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,916
and make them last forever.

395
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,416
[YOU] But, all good things
must come to an end.

396
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,416
[DIA]
We can't turn back time

397
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,000
any more than we can relive
those precious moments.

398
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,250
In a way, it's very sad.

399
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,291
[RUBY]
But at the same time,

400
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,291
we're also kind of
looking forward to tomorrow.

401
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,041
Because who knows
what it will bring.

402
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,750
[HANAMARU] And, maybe
that's the sort of thing

403
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,625
that makes us more aware
of the passage of time.

404
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,666
Life goes on, zura.

405
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,333
[YOSHIKO]
And then, it becomes obvious.

406
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,166
That perhaps it's
precisely because

407
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,416
this time will never come again,

408
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,875
that we can truly enjoy
this moment for what it is.

409
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,166
[YOSHIKO]
When you realize that,

410
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,833
when you know what is happening
now will never happen again,

411
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,750
you learn to cherish it.

412
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,333
[RIKO]
Because we all know...

413
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,833
...things will come
to an end someday.

414
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,833
Because we all know

415
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,708
that tomorrow is
still waiting for us.

416
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,750
[MARI] Together, we will walk
towards a bright new future.

417
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:31,833
[MARI] Together,
we can do it with a smile.

418
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:08,666
That concludes the festival
for Uranohoshi High School.

419
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,166
When I see how many people
showed up today,

420
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,041
I realize just how much
this school was loved.

421
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,583
Not only by the students
who have worked

422
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,375
so hard to make it great,

423
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,625
but by the community as well.

424
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:24,166
It truly is a special school.

00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,291
So, this school
closing festival,

426
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,791
the whole thing made me...

427
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,166
...it made me happy.

428
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,041
I felt warmth,

429
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:38,166
stronger than I've
ever felt before.

Oh, Mari.

00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,791

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

If I'd just had a bit more time,
maybe I could've...

Thank you, thank you all!

[MARI]
Are you ready?

447
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,000
Let's finish things
by singing together!

448
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,208
Sing with joy and cheer!

Sing with everything you've got!

it reaches the heavens above!
