[MARI] Our <i>brillante</i>
performance at the prelims

00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:19,041
qualified Aqours for the
final round of Love Live!

[RIKO]
It's over?

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,291
This is really the end?

00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:22,750
[MARI] But then we couldn't
get enough applicants

00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,625
and the school merger
became final.

Our group took it pretty hard,
especially Chika-chi.

[YOSHIMI] You can preserve
our school's name.

[CHIKA]
You better believe!

We'll leave our school's

I don't think I can go on.

This is just a crazy dream!

A dream.

34
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,500
It has to be, because
there's no possible way

35
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,125
it could snow this
hard in Uchiura.

36
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,416
Well if that's the case
then I'll close my eyes,

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,208
and when I open them,
I'll be back home again!

Or not.

Maybe you should try
wearing more layers?

That's not surprising.

No, that's not our intention.

doubt there's

Actually, this is a
great opportunity.

We can learn how
we appear on stage

from the audience's
point of view.

157

And it'll give us some insight
on what entertains everyone,

That was unexpected.

[RIKO] I still can't
believe it even happened.

Well, it is Love Live.

I suppose,

170

and a mistake like that
is hard to bounce back from.

that we go back to the hotel

and get settled in.

will be better tomorrow,

some sight-seeing.

321
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,291
I've made up my mind, sis!

322
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,791
I don't wanna be a school idol.

323
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,458
I'm seriously quitting.

324
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,250
Saint Snow is
officially disbanded.

[SARAH]
Are you sure?

326
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,291
You're only a first year.

327
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,875
You still have another chance!

328
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,500
[LEAH]
Yes. I'm positive.

329
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,875
I don't want anything to do
with Love Live or school idols.

330
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,958
[gasps]

331
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,791
[SARAH] We didn't mean to
make a scene during your meal.

332
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,375
I'm sorry.

[HANAMARU]
It's the future, zura.

334
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,500
No way.

335
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,333
Are you gonna unhinge your jaw?

336
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,750
Zura!

[YOSHIKO]
Hey, let me try a bite.

338
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,208
[HANAMARU]
Get your own!

339
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,625
[YOSHIKO] Don't be so
greedy! I'll share...

340
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,166
I don't get why she
wants to quit over it.

341
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,125
Well, for one thing,
if she continued,

342
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,666
she'd have to do
so alone, right?

343
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,958
No, she could always
recruit some new members!

344
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,875
Except it's not really
that simple to Leah, is it?

345
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,958
I guess not. Huh.

346
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,541
We've been in their
position before, though.

347
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,125
[KANAN] In the end, a mistake
that was made on stage,

348
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,458
can only be fixed on stage.

349
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,250
[DIA] But, feelings
aren't that simple.

350
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:47,333
You can't expect Leah to just
shift gears and be happy again.

351
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,375
Maybe... she lost
some of her confidence.

352
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,625
[RUBY]
I don't think that's it.

353
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,666
[RUBY] It's because Sarah
won't be there anymore.

354
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,125
I think she doesn't
like the fact that

355
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,791
she can't be a school idol
with her big sister.

356
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:06,666
Leah only wants to sing...
if Sarah's by her side.

Really?

You think so?

361
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,250
That would make sense.

362
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,708
It would be lonely.

363
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,416
Hold on! What I meant was,

364
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,416
I kind of saw Leah
crying earlier and--!

365
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,250
Crying?

[DIA]
What a pretty view.

00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,583
So did you and Leah
talk at the restaurant?

Mm-mm.

I just...

373
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,583
[RUBY] ...thought that
must be the case, is all.

374
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,291
Because, it's how I'm feeling.

376
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:02,791
Because I know, when the final
round is done, so is our time.

377
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,541
Well, we can't do
much about that.

378

idol has always been your dream,

so hard to be one.

And yet, it'll all be over soon.

381
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,458
True, but here's a secret.

382
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,750
I'm very happy.

383
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:25,041
Because of you, Ruby,
and all the rest of Aqours.

384
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,875
You see, you girls
are the reason

385
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,500
I was able to fulfill my
dream of being a school idol.

386

We're going to the
final round of Love Live,

387
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,958
to the Akiba Dome.

I wanna keep singing
with you, Dia!

after the final round?

I'm not sure.

All I really know is that
our school will close down,

and you and the rest of third
years will have graduated.

Dunno.

To be perfectly honest,

407
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,833
I just haven't given
it that much thought.

408

Right now, I'm just
trying to stay focused

and continue preparing
for Love Live.

Yeah.

But, you know what?

[YOU]
Big sisters.

413
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,541
What are they like?

414
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,500
Um, it's kinda hard to explain.

415
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,791
Especially since I'm not like

416
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,541
particularly close with
my sisters or anything.

417

And yet, maybe we're
close after all.

How?

00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,125
Do you remember
the first concert

420
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,458
we ever held at our school?

421
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:12,291
Mito actually came out in the
rain just to watch us perform.

When she showed up I almost
lost it then and there.

I was so happy to see her.

Oh, that's cool.

I guess it's just something I
don't really understand though.

Yeah, well me neither.

Because it's just the way
it's always been, you know?

She said she had an
errand or somethin'.

Okay.

Hang on a second, that looks
exactly like the hamburger

when you told me that you'd
decided to become a school idol.

I was glad, and also
it made me proud,

because of what it
meant for you.

learning how to
think independently.

Well, duh, obviously I would
research the competition.

466

Naturally, I found out that
my sister is way better.

If anything, she's better
than your big sis.

She can't even do a backflip.

No, but she's so good at
classical Japanese dance

473
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,125
that she could teach it,
and she plays the koto, too!

474
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,166
That has nothing
to do with being an idol.

That's not remotely true!

And Kanan even told me
that the basics needed

are exactly the same!

00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,291
[RUBY]
I get it.

480
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,125
You really love
your sister, don't you?

481
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,875
Well yeah, of course I do.

482
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,000
What the heck is
up with you anyway?

483
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,000
Normally you never speak.

484
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:04,625
It's because I love my sister,
and she gives me strength.

485
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:07,875
You know what?

486
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,375
I learned that my
big sister is very happy.

487
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,166
Well, so she said.

488
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,583
About what?

489
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,166
[RUBY] Even if Dia and I
aren't doing things together,

490
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,125
if I work hard to achieve
something without her help,

491
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:23,958
she told me that it
makes her really happy.

492
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,250
That's why...

493
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,416
...I think Sarah must
feel the same way.

494
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,250
[LEAH]
You think I don't know that?

495
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,541
Oh, you do?

496
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,750
The thing is...

497
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,291
...I've been trying, and...

498
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,291
...I wanted to show her
that I'd be okay without her.

499
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,541
That she wouldn't have to worry.

500
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,708
[LEAH]
But I failed.

501
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,333
I messed up at
her last Love Live!

502
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,541
[LEAH sobs]

503
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,791
Then you just need to make sure

504
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,833
it's not your last
performance, right?

505

--[RUBY giggles]

506
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,958
[LEAH]
Wait, what do you mean?

507
00:21:55,041 --> 00:22:00,000
--[LEAH pants]

508
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,500
[BOTH]
Wow!

509
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,916
[RUBY]
Why don't we sing together?

510
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,041
Let's make our own song.

511
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:19,041
We can dedicate it
to both of our sisters.

512
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:22,666
And then we'll sing it,
in this light!

513
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:50,625
[DIA, RUBY]
Next time, "Awaken the power."
