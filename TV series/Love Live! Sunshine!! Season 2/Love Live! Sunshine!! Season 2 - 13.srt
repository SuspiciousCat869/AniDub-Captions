00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:21,583
[CHIKA] Wow, my school uniform
almost looks like new today!

2
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,875
[SHIMA] I used heavy starch
to make it nice and crisp.

3
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,208
[CHIKA]
Thanks, Shima.

4
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,291
[CHIKA'S MOM]
Make sure you button it

5
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,375
all the way up to the top.

00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,250
[CHIKA grunts]

7
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,083
[CHIKA]
Mom, it's too tight!

8
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,250
[CHIKA'S MOM]
Is it?

9
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,583
Well then, that can
only mean one thing.

10
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,916
[CHIKA]
What?

11
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,416
[CHIKA'S MOM]
You've gained weight.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,333
[CHIKA]
Hey!

13
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,250
Jeez, talk about rude, mother.

14
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,208
[DOG barks]

15
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,250
[CHIKA]
Riko! What's with the dog?

16
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,583
[RIKO]
Good morning!

17
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,458
This is the newest member
of our family, Prelude.

18
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:50,666
Say hello!

19
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,708
[PRELUDE barks]

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,083
Now that I'm
over my fear of dogs,

21
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,833
I can't get over how cute
my sweet Prelude is!

22
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:58,625
--[CHIKA] I.. see.
--Who's a good doggie, huh?

23
00:00:58,708 --> 00:00:59,916

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,916
Look who it is!

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
[RIKO] Shiitake looks so happy
with her new puppies.

27
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,458
[CHIKA] Yeah,
they had already been born

28
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,625
by the time we
got back from Tokyo.

29
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:10,791
What a great surprise!

30
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,000
[PUPPIES bark]

31
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:16,125
That's for sure,
but who knew she was a girl?

32
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,041
Ahoy!

33
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,166
[RIKO, CHIKA]
Ahoy!

34
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,916
You're in a good mood, You.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,083
Well, it's the
last day of school.

36
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,875
Most of the others
are already here.

37
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:27,958
[YOSHIKO] ...commands you
to leave her alone!

38
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,333
You can't stay up there
forever, zura.

39
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,833
The ceremony's about to start!

40
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:34,416
Just leave me alo--

41
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,916
[yells]

[ALL gasp]

43
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,791
[YOSHIKO]
Don't look at me!

44
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,833
I hope she's okay.

45
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,291
[GIRLS laugh]

46
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:44,541
So, you feeling nervous?

47
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:45,791
Not at all.

48
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,208
Same, I'm actually excited.

49
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,666
We've worked hard for this day.

50
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,125
[YOSHIKO whines]

51
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,416
[HANAMARU]
Wow, you don't mess around

52
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,333
when it comes to bad hair days.

53
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:58,916
[YOSHIKO]
It's not a bad hair day.

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,166
I was trying to make it
look nice for the ceremony,

55
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,750
but it turned out like this.

56
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:03,916
[RUBY]
Aw, don't cry.

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,625
[HANAMARU]
Yeah, we'll help you, zura.

58
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,208
We'll just use this lil' baby
to get you sorted out.

59
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,375
Chop chop.

60
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,750
Okay, yeah,
that should probably work.

61
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,208
Wait, don't you dare, Zuramaru!

62
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:23,333
You know, this room
is actually kinda big.

63
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,750
Well, we did have
a lot of stuff in here.

64
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,958
Maybe if we had been
a little cleaner

65
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,583
the room wouldn't have
felt quite so small.

66
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,291
[CHIKA]
Probably.

67
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,500
[CHIKA]
Kanan.

68
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,250
I guess now it's all gone, huh?

69
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,000
[KANAN]
Not exactly.

70
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,250
It's still in our hearts.

71
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,333
That much remains.

72
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:50,750
[CHIKA]
Mm.

73
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,750
[STUDENTS chattering]

74
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:53,916
[DIA]
Mari.

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,333
Something up?

76
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,416
What's wrong?

77
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,208
No goofing off today.

78
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,083
This ceremony is important.

79
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,166
Promise me you'll
take it seriously.

80
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,000
[MARI]
I promise, <i>bella</i> !

81
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,416
And don't worry.

82
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,208
Everyone will be on their best,
most normal behavior.

83
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,125
Wait, define "normal."

84
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,041
It's my Rubesty! Heh.

85
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:17,916
[MARI giggles]

86
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,958
All done!

87
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,458
Using my dark powers,

88
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,708
I was able to revert to my
previous, more magnificent form!

89
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,000
Hear me roar!

90
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,416
Meaning we basically
re-styled her hair, zura.

91
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,500
[STUDENTS laughing, chattering]

92
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,833
Um, Mari.

93
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,458
What's happening?

94
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,916
[CHIKA]
Hey, girlfriend!

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,125
It's the last day of school
so everyone's writing messages!

96
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,208
Seriously?

97
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,083
<i>Sì</i> !

98
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,833
I decided to open the courtyard,

99
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,041
so the students could
have a little fun!

100
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,875
[RUBY]
Here. Come join us, sis!

101
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,416
[sighs]

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,833
Not to put a damper on the mood,

103
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,916
but the ceremony is starting
soon and we're all filthy.

104
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,500
To be fair though,
this is normal for our school.

105
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,583
The best things in life
are often messy.

106
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:05,916
[YOU]
Looking back on it,

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,500
we sure made some
fun memories here, didn't we?

108
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,083
[RIKO]
All of our practices.

109
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,041
The times we goofed off.

110
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:19,125
[RUBY cries]

111
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,625
[HANAMARU]
Keep it together.

112
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,500
Don't cry.

113
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,666
We all promised
that we wouldn't cry,

114
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,208
so you have to be
strong right now.

115
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,125
[RUBY]
'Kay...

116
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,625
That's right.

117
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,333
There's still so much
left to celebrate.

118
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,833
[applause]

119
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:38,083
[MARI] Next on the agenda,
we'll award the diplomas.

120
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:41,958
Please welcome the graduate's
representative, Kanan Matsuura.

121
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,291
[KANAN]
Thank you.

122
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,083
It feels a little strange,
having you give it to me.

123
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:54,708
You've worked hard for this
diploma, so be proud of it.

124
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,541
Congratulations
on your graduation.

125
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:03,541
[DIA] On this day,
we conclude an era.

126
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:07,458
Uranohoshi High School
will end its extensive history.

127
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:12,416
However, this school and its
memory shall remain forever.

128
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,125
We'll carry it with us.

129
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,708
I feel proud.

130
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,666
Proud to start on a new path
with those memories.

131
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,458
Proud to have been a student
at such a wonderful school.

132
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,375
Proud to have known you.

133
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:29,041
It's up to us now, to keep
this place alive in our hearts.

134
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,958
[DIA]
As of this moment,

135
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:38,125
I pronounce Uranohoshi High
officially closed.

136
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,583
Congratulations are in order!

137
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,416
We really won it!

138
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,708
We won Love Live!

139
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,166
[DIA] Well, it's about time
for everyone to head home.

140
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,875
So she says,
but no one's leaving yet.

141
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,708
I imagine that they'll stay here

142
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,375
until someone
forces them to leave.

143
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,541
Better watch out
for school squatters!

144
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,916
On the other hand,
they can't close the school

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,583
if there are still
people inside it.

146
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,833
If only it were that easy,
then everyone would be happy.

147
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:37,666
[CHIKA]
For real!

148
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,166
[KANAN]
Let's go close up.

149
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,291
It's only right that the
students are the ones to do it.

150
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,958
[CHIKA]
Whoa, awesome!

151
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,208
[RIKO]
It's beautiful.

152
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,250
[YOU]
I'll say.

153
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,791
Like it?

154
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,916
We all drew it based off our
memories of you at the finals.

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,166
[YOSHIMI] At least, this is
how you appeared to us

156
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,250
and to the rest of the audience.

157
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,708
[MUTSU]
You were shining!

158
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,833
[ITSUKO] Yeah, so bright,
it almost blinded us.

159
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:00,958
[CHIKA]
Thanks so much.

160
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,291
We saw you, too.

161
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,750
You were out there
shining, as well!

162
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,250
Lights dancing
in every direction,

163
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,791
across the entire stadium!

164
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,375
So it sounds like
everything was shining, then!

165
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,416
[CHIKA]
Yep!

166
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,750
I guess so!

167
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,083
It was super awesome!

168
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,666
[ALL giggle]

169
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,958
Okay, time to close it.

170
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,541
[HANAMARU]
That's the last of 'em, zura.

171
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,625
It's weird without
the books in here.

172
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,291
[HANAMARU] They weren't
thrown away or anything.

173
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,000
Rather, they flew off
to a new home, like birds.

174
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,000
[RUBY]
Like, flappity flap?

175
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,500
[HANAMARU]
Wherever they go next,

176
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,041
they'll have the chance
to be read by someone new.

177
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,833
I think that's
sorta beautiful, zura.

178
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,083
Just like the books,

179
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,166
we'll be in a brand-new place
next year, too.

180
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,125
I'm kinda scared, zura.

181
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,833
Yeah, so am I. But still,

182
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:02,083
after becoming a school idol
with you and everyone else,

183
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,875
I think we'll be okay.

184
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:04,750
[YOSHIKO]
Descend!

185
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,416
Huh?

186
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,791
[YOSHIKO] Come on,
let's get out of here

187
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,166
my faithful little demons!

188
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,208
[HANAMARU, RUBY]
Mm-hm!

189
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,125
[HANAMARU]
Let's close it together.

190
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,458
No thanks.

191
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,708
[HANAMARU]
I want us to close it together.

192
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,750
I said no thanks.

193
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,666
It's not a request, zura!

194
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,958
It has to be all of us.

195
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,041
If you insist.

196
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:31,791
I'm sorry.

197
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,333
Yeah, don't worry about it.

198
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,166
[RUBY giggles]

199
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,583
Dear library,

200
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,125
thanks so much for always
bein' a safe place for us.

201
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,666
[YOSHIKO]
We'll miss you.

202
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,166
[RUBY]
Goodbye.

203
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,208
[piano plays]

204
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,291
Hey, that sounds pretty.

205
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,041
Thank you, the piano here
has a really beautiful sound.

206
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,041
Maybe it's because
the room has an echo?

207
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,875
Possibly.

208
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,416
[YOU]
You know,

209
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,083
I'll miss this view.

210
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,208
[RIKO] Back when I first
transferred to this school,

211
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,583
I thought that there's no way

212
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,916
I'd find this kind
of view in Tokyo.

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,875
[YOU] So, hey, there's something
I've been wanting to say. Um...

214
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,541
[RIKO]
Hm?

215
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:28,958
It's that... it's that
I really love you, Riko!

216
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,708
Aw, I love you, too!

217
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,750
[BOTH laugh]

218
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,708
I had a lot of fun
with everyone.

219
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,708
It was a pretty good year.

220
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,708
Yeah, it was.

221
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,250

222
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,208
How long are you
gonna stand there?

223
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,166
[MARI]
As long as I want.

224
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,708
[DIA]

[gasps]

226
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,833
Here, this diploma
is especially for you.

227
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,291
It's special?

228
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,625
[DIA] Diploma and
Certificate of Appreciation

229
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,250
for Miss Mari Ohara.

230
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,666
This certifies
that you've excelled

231
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,291
as a student and director
while serving this school.

232
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,000
Hence, in order to show
our sincere gratitude

233
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,208
we present you
with this certificate.

234
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,666
On behalf of all the students
at Uranohoshi Girls' High,

235
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,458
by us, Kanan Matsuura.

236
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,000
[DIA]
And Dia Kurosawa.

237
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,041
Really? But I...

238
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,416
It's all yours.

239
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,708
[KANAN]
Take it.

240
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:37,166
[KANAN] It's okay,
because the sky is connected.

241
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,833
We may not see each other.

242
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,833
We may be far apart.

243
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,291
But always connected.

244
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,500
[MARI]
Thank you.

Goodbye.

This is the last room.

248
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,291
Because of this place...

249
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,583
We were always
able to work hard.

250
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,250
[YOU] Because of this place,
we were able to move forward.

251
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,208
All the practice we did.

252
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,833
All the costumes we designed.

253
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,625
All the sore muscles.

254
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,375
The difficult dances.

255
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,041
The nerves and anxiety.

256
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,333
This room held
a great many things.

257
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:32,250
Through every single trial,
we had this place.

258
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,166
We'll go wait for you outside.

We'll make sure our memories

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,375
are full of nothing but smiles.

272
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,416
I won't cry.

00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,583
I'm not gonna cry!

It's okay.

Together.

277
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,208
Oh, why'd you pick that spot
for your flag?

278
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,833
Because I wanted it
to be in a place

279
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,083
where everyone could see it.

280

Whether you're coming or going,

it will always be there
to wave hello.

Hey! Chika! Guess what?

Your new school uniform
just got here!

[CHIKA]
Okay!

00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,958
Spring has arrived.

Did the third years
already go on their way?

287

Yeah.

00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,416
they've all left.

[CHIKA'S MOM]
Say, do you remember?

291
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,250
You were such a worry-wart,

292
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,708
always stressing about
what people would think of you

293
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,208
if you failed at something.

294
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,791
You'd get so frustrated,

295
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,583
and then you would cover your
tracks by pretending to give up.

296
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,625
[CHIKA'S MOM] Kind of
like that paper airplane.

Yes?

Do you think... we found it?

300
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,250
Our radiance, I mean.

301
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,416
We found it at Love Live, right?

302
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,125
Is that what you've
been telling yourself?

303
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,875
[MITO]
You're as dense as ever, Chika!

304
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,708
[SHIMA] You can
throw that paper airplane

305
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,750
as many times as you want.

306
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,166
After all the hard work you did,
I'm sure you'll find the answer.

307
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,791
It's out there somewhere.

308
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,250
The Chika who didn't give up
is more than capable of

309
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,333
finding what she's looking for.

[MARI] I'm not letting go
until you say yes!

325
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,291
[DIA]
Both of you, cut it out!

326
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,083
You're acting like children!

327
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,750
[RUBY]
Please!

328
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,708
Without you
this doesn't feel right!

329
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,208
Be a school idol with me!

330
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,500
[HANAMARU]
I'm scared.

331
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,416
Can I even do it?

332
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,750
[YOSHIKO]
I might say weird stuff again,

333
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,875
and there might be some times
when I perform rituals.

334
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,750
What if I order you
to become my demons?

335
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:13,458
[KANAN]
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.

336
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,625
Try and speed up your movement
right there, Ruby.

337
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,916
[RUBY]
Uh... 'Kay!

338
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,083
[KANAN]
Oh, and Yoshiko.

339
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,375
[YOSHIKO]
Yohane!

340
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,541
[KANAN laughs] You need to
speed up a bit, too.

341
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,291
[YOSHIKO]
Understood. Teleportation mode!

342
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,250
You really are such a liar.

343
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:39,166
You promised everyone
you wouldn't cry.

344
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,458
Liar.

345
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,250
[CHIKA cries]

346
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,625
[CHIKA]
Why?

347
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,208
Why am I remembering
those things?

348
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,750
Why am I hearing their voices?

349
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,625
It's not fair.

350
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,666
It's not.

351
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,333
[GIRLS]
Roar!

352
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,333
[CHIKA] It was the miracle
that I desperately needed.

353
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,041
It could only be one thing.

354
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,375
Fate.

355
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,000
I wanted to be
captivated by something.

356
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,458
I wanted to do
my best in something.

357
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,416
I just wanted to put
my best foot forward.

358
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,666
But, my feet didn't exactly
know where they were going yet.

359
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,958
Luckily, destiny stepped in
and took charge.

360
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,958
It gave me a push,
and there it was!

361
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,458
That radiance was--

362
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,041
[groans]

363

[pants]

364
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,250
Chika!


365
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,333
Jeez, you're late!


366
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,125
Yeah, what took you so long?


367
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,291
[STUDENTS laugh]


368
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,166
But how?

369
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,083
I don't understand.

370
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,458
[STUDENTS]
Ta-da!

371
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,416
No way.


372
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,791
This isn't a dream.


373
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,458
We're here because we all
wanted to sing with you.


374
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,750
One last time.


375
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,041
In our old school.


376
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,250
We made a contract!


377
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,791
Yeah, we've been waitin'!


378
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,500
For you, Chika!


379
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,000
So let's sing.


380
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,916
[GIRLS]
Together!


381
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,833
[ALL]
Together!

382
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:36,791
[music plays]

[singing in Japanese]

384
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,833
I get it.

385
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,250
The radiance I've
been searching for!

386
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,791
Our own unique way to shine!

387
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,916
I've been struggling to find it
for what feels like forever,

388
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
but now I see it!

389
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:21,958
It was always there,
from the very beginning!

390
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,583
[CHIKA]
Everything we did,

391
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,083
every single step we took

392
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,708
and the long hours of
hard work we put in--

393
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:31,625
all that was our own radiance!

394
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:36,500
Shining from inside of us,
as a part of Aqours!
