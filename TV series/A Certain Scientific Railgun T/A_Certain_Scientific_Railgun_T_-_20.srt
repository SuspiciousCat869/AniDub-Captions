1
00:00:34,483 --> 00:00:36,483
I wonder what I should
have you make for me.

2
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:38,942
Curry is, all told,
the obvious choice.

3
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:41,358
But as far as other dishes
that are good with mackerel,

4
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:42,650
we've got options.

5
00:00:44,817 --> 00:00:45,900
[SATEN gasps]

6
00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:49,567
[RAKKO chuckles]

7
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:53,692
[SATEN]
Blood? Wait, what happened?

8
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:58,358
[SATEN]
Wha--? Hey, what's going on?

9
00:00:58,442 --> 00:00:59,900
[FRENDA]
We're being shot at!

10
00:00:59,983 --> 00:01:01,108
But from where?

11
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:05,650
The bullet went right through.
But I'm okay.

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,983
I still have feeling in my arm.

13
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,400
I have to contact Mugino and--

14
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:12,067
I shouldn't be visible
to the surrounding buildings

15
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,067
at this angle.

16
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,483
It's not a long-range shooter.

17
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:16,983
Hey, are you all right?

18
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:18,067
[FRENDA]
We're going inside!

19
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,150
[SATEN]
Hold on!

20
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:32,025
[RAKKO chuckles]

21
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:33,775
So she gave up
on calling her friends

22
00:01:33,858 --> 00:01:35,817
as well as this hiding spot.

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,317
She knows how much
danger she's in.

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,025
After fleeing into
the department store

25
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:41,650
and pausing for a moment,

26
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:44,775
they took the elevator
to a higher floor.

27
00:01:44,858 --> 00:01:46,692
[chuckles]

28
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:48,483
I do hope you'll entertain me.

29
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:26,025
[SATEN]
Do you think they came after me?

30
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:28,650
--[FRENDA] Probably.
--[SATEN] Um, okay.

31
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,942
[FRENDA] We're gonna try
to buy some time in here.

32
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:34,400
All told, with this many people
every way you look,

33
00:03:34,483 --> 00:03:36,525
it should be easy for us
to disguise ourselves,

34
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:38,108
blend in,
and give them the slip.

35
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:40,650
[SATEN gasps]

36
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,275
[FRENDA]
They took a shot?

37
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:46,025
In a crowd like this,
with no hesitation?

38
00:03:46,108 --> 00:03:46,858
[FRENDA]
Run!

39
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:47,942
Uh, right!

40
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:50,650
[FRENDA]
Crap.

41
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:52,900
They're the ones using
the crowd against us!

42
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,442
[RAKKO] If you thought this
situation would help you,

43
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:57,775
you're sorely mistaken.

44
00:03:57,858 --> 00:04:00,192
My sniper rifle
is under my clothes.

45
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,067
I can assemble it
simply by bending

46
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,567
and stretching my arm.

47
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,650
And I can silently shoot
my rounds with the force

48
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:07,983
of CO2 gas.

49
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:10,150
There isn't a single
person here who realizes

50
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:13,192
I'm a sniper aiming at you.

51
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:14,900
We should ask some
of these people to help.

52
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:16,567
That won't do anything for us!

53
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,983
They're more likely to panic,

54
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:20,983
which would just end up limiting
our movement instead.

55
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,317
We're up against an enemy
hiding in the crowd.

56
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,775
That could be a fatal move!

57
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:27,733
Then we could try to borrow
someone's phone.

58
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:28,983
[FRENDA]
And what?

59
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:30,442
Risk that person getting
their head blown off?

60
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,817
[FRENDA] We're being driven
into an emptier area.

61
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,775
There are two types of hunters--

62
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:48,233
The type who take joy
in doing a perfect job

63
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:51,442
without ever letting their
presence be known.

64
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,317
And the type
who like to show off

65
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,817
and enjoy watching
their prey writhe in pain.

66
00:04:57,692 --> 00:04:59,692
This one is definitely
the latter!

67
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,900
And the reason I know that

68
00:05:01,983 --> 00:05:03,442
is that all told,

69
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:04,775
I'm the latter, too!

70
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:08,567

[STREET MAN A grunts]

[CROWD chattering]

75
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:24,192
[STREET MAN A]
I didn't have any choice!

76
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:26,692
I didn't double-cross you
because I wanted to!

--No way!

[CROWD gasps, yells]

80
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:37,983
[RAKKO] Ah, the pleasure of
that last, wretched scream

81
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:40,233
the prey lets out.

82
00:05:40,317 --> 00:05:41,733
I wonder.

83
00:05:41,817 --> 00:05:44,192
What kind of sound
will you make in the end?

84
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:47,775
[FRENDA] This person probably
has a personal set

85
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:49,942
of expectations for their hunt.

86
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:51,608
So if their prey deviates
in some way

87
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,358
that displeases them,
they'll kill them

88
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:54,692
on the spot.

89
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:56,650
On the other hand,
that means they'll prolong this

90
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:59,525
as long as we play
into their quirks.

91
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:02,025
In other words, that sadistic
nature is going to

92
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:03,567
cost them their life.

93
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:06,608
If they're targeting us
from the crowd.

94
00:06:13,192 --> 00:06:14,275
I've got you!

95

[FRENDA] You fell for it,
you twisted sicko!

96
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,567
Thought I was over there, huh?

97
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,233
In reality, I was right here,
waiting to ambush you!

98
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:26,817
What do you mean?

He shot me twice,
so yeah, it is!

102
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:36,650
[SATEN] But how can you be
sure he's the one who did it?

103
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:38,150
[FRENDA] If you're targeting
someone from a crowd,

104
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:40,150
you're gonna have to
disguise your firearm.

105
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,442
And glancing around the area,

106
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:42,983
this guy is the only one
carrying something

107

long enough.

You gotta think critically!

irrefutable proof!

ordinary golf clubs inside.

That was close.

What's up? I'm back.

141
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:18,733
I snagged us three cards,
and I brought a researcher

142

from the place that
was keeping all of them.

not up to her old tricks.

00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:08,650
they should have
lost us long ago.

163
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,983
I can't figure out
how to counter this.

164
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,983
[RAKKO]
I suppose it's about time.

165
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:18,692
Once I shoot through her legs
and she can't move anymore,

166
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,317
she'll start begging
for her life--

167
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,525
Oh, no!

168
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:26,025
This is terrible timing!

169
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,358
I'm on a mission!

170
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,650
But what if they're like,

171
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:31,567
"Oh, Yumiya!
What a crazy coincidence,

172
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,483
running into you here like this!

173
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,900
By all means, come and join us!"

174
00:09:35,983 --> 00:09:38,233
If they were to invite me
along like that,

175
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:40,442
I'd have no choice
but to say yes!

[STUDENTS laugh]

177
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,567
[RAKKO]
What an amazing assassin I am.

178
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,525
My ability to blend in
with my surroundings

179
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:50,025
is utterly perfect.

180
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:51,775
And no, it has nothing
to do with me being

181
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,442
a loner who's
practically invisible

182

to the average person.

00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:58,233
Oh, they're gone.

184
00:09:58,317 --> 00:10:00,317
[FRENDA]
It hurts, a lot.

185
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,442
Honestly, without knowing
where they're attacking from,

186
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:05,442
I basically have no options.

187
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:07,192
Why is this happening to me?

188
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:08,108
[SATEN]
Hey!

189
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:09,358
[FRENDA]
That's right.

190
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,608
I'm not even
the one they're after.

191
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:12,692
All told,

192
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:14,067
I only know her
because we shared one

193
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,942
canned mackerel dinner.

194
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:19,067
I'm under no obligation
to protect her.

195
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,483
If we both run in
opposite directions,

196
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,525
the enemy will follow her.

197
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:26,817
I hate to do this, but I have
to use her as bait.

198
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:30,483
I can't just ditch her, because
she'll come chasing after me.

199
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:32,608
I have to talk her
into it somehow--

200
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:35,775
[SATEN]
Hey! We should split up!

201
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:36,858
What?

202
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:38,317
If we go in
different directions,

203
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,317
it's more likely
they'll come after me.

204
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:44,733
[SATEN]
Huh? What is it--?

205
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,067
[FRENDA]
I know we should split up!

206
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,775
You don't have to tell me that!

207
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,400
But if you left my side,
could you protect yourself?

208
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:53,858
You're a Level 0, right?

209
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:56,150
Do you think they won't kill
you after they catch you?

210
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:57,692
I don't know what kind
of info you have,

211
00:10:57,775 --> 00:10:59,108
but once you tell them
what they want to know,

212
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,900
they'll just get rid of you!

213
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:03,900
I know, but if we do nothing,

214
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:06,525
they're gonna get both
of us at this rate.

215
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:10,150
And I know I'm just a liability.

216
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:11,817
I-It's all right.

217
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,983
I can hold my own
in a race, trust me.

218
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:20,275
[FRENDA]
All told...

219
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:22,983
I knew you were soft from
the second I saw you.

220
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:25,858
But I didn't think
you were this dumb.

221
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:27,608
But...

222
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:31,108
If you insist, then I guess
we'll do this your way.

223
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:32,817
Let's turn you into a decoy.

224
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:37,983
[RAKKO sighs]
This isn't good.

225

If I take too long,
Yobou will chew me out again.

226

[YOBOU]
Hm?

227
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:44,358
[RAKKO]
I have to hurry.

228
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:46,483
She's coming this way
by herself?

229
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:49,900
[FRENDA] But, if you insist,
then I guess we'll do this

230
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:50,983
your way.

231
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:53,525
Let's turn you into a decoy.

232
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:56,233
You're nothing but a
level 0 burden right now.

233
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,525
But if you're willing to
put your life on the line,

234
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:00,358
you can become
the perfect soldier.

235
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:03,317
[SATEN]
All right.

236
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:07,858
[FRENDA]
Are you sure about this?

237
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:10,650
What if I'm tricking you
to save my own skin?

238
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:13,025
[SATEN] If you hadn't rescued me
when they first caught me,

239
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,233
I'd already be dead.

240
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,942
So even if you do run,

241
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:19,483
I won't hold a grudge.

242
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:20,567
Yeah?

243
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:25,692
[RAKKO] My tracking is
for following targets.

244
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:27,275
If they come back to me,
I can't tell

245
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:29,650
what their actions
are on the way.

246
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:31,567
I doubt she's seen
through my skills--

247
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,733
this is just a coincidence.

248
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:36,525
But I know what
my prey is trying to do.

249
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:38,067
Identify me.

250
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,650
The blonde is using
the black-haired one

251
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:42,942
as a decoy so she
can observe the crowd.

252
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,317
She'll make a note
of whoever reacts

253
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,317
to her friend and attack
them from the shadows.

254
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,942
But it won't work.

255
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:51,108
As someone who has
mastered the art of lonely--

256
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:53,608
I mean assassination,
I can blend perfectly

257
00:12:53,692 --> 00:12:57,067
into a crowd and not
look out of place.

258
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,650
My gaze, my expression,
the way I carry myself.

259
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:02,608
All perfectly natural.

260
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:04,233
Ah well, there's
always the chance

261
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,108
that she abandoned the
black-haired one to run away,

262
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:09,025
but that would just make
things more fun for me,

263
00:13:09,108 --> 00:13:10,983
so I wouldn't mind.

264
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:13,817
Friendship is such
a superficial thing, after all.

[RAKKO gasps]

00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:19,192
No, that isn't it.

267
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:21,358
She didn't abandon her.

268
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:22,942
The blonde's plan is...

269
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:25,275
Bombs?

270
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:28,275
This girl is expendable! Crap!

271

This plan gets her
everything she wants.

272
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:32,358
She can waltz
right on out of here,

273
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:33,358
and every witness
will be caught up

Not to mention, it'll kill me!

It's three birds with one stone!

277
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:41,567
But if she commits
indiscriminate mass murder,

her whole organization
is done for.

279

Does she really think
the cornered mouse

280
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:46,900
can bite the cat?

my doll was supposed

[SATEN] Not to be pessimistic,

302
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:48,567
this'll help us find them?

But if they have a way to see
what we're doing right now,

If my prediction
is correct, though,

I figured you might come
over for dinner again,

320
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:31,483
so I stocked up on
a whole bunch of it

321
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:32,692
just in case!

322
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:34,400
I can't eat it all by myself.

323
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:35,983
If you don't step up
and come eat it with me,

324
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,150
it'll all go to waste!

They may only be
good for shockwaves

329
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:58,108
with no shrapnel inside,
but to use bombs

330
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:00,192
in close-quarters
combat is insane!

331
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:02,608
However...

[RAKKO laughs]

that you can't throw right,

[RAKKO grunts]

336
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:28,858
Really? With all that boasting,
I was expecting you to be

337
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:30,233
less pathetic.

me back a hundredfold?

Good luck.

when you can't even stand?

I...

I can't keep this up
much longer, huh?

343
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:46,192
All told,
the reason I'm staying down

344
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:48,275
is because it's about
to be a whole lot safer

[RAKKO]
A mass detonation?

348
00:16:56,192 --> 00:16:57,983
When did she plant
so many of them?

349
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,233
Was it while the
black-haired one

350
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:00,692
was acting as a decoy?

351
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:05,025
She might be trying to
use the smoke as cover,

352
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,692
but it will take a lot more
than this to get away

00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,275
from my nose.

with the advantage here.

Low oxygen?

357
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:21,442
She was using thermobarics?

358
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:23,067
So that's what you were up to.

359

Sorry, but you didn't
close the deal!

360
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:29,817
There's no point unless
it's an airtight space!

00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,567
And there's plenty
of oxygen streaming in

00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,233
that would have
made you a target?

No.

[SATEN] Sorry I couldn't

Ugh. That questioning
took forever!

At least it's over now.

375
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:17,025
[SATEN]
Thanks for waiting, Uiharu.

376
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:20,025
I've got a rough schedule
mocked up for you.

377
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:21,400
Considering how little we know,

378
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:23,983
there's a chance you
may still be in danger.

379
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:25,400
So for the next few days,

380
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:28,608
you're going to be staying
at an Antiskill facility.

381
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,067
Once it's been determined
that the threat

382
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,400
has lessened enough,
you can go back

383
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:32,608
to your dorm.

384
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:34,317
At that point,
you'll still be guarded

385
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,817
by Judgment until they
decide you're safe without it.

386
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,733
So you're in good hands.

387
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,650
[SATEN]
All that for me, huh?

388
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:42,025
[UIHARU]
It's no trouble!

389
00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:46,108
So hey, about that mall, uh...

390
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,650
[UIHARU]
Oh, right.

391
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:48,942
According to the report,

392
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:50,775
there were signs of
explosives and a struggle,

393
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:54,525
which lines up with all
of the witness statements.

394
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:57,108
They also didn't find any
injured people or bodies.

Oh, yeah?

let's get you moved in.

we have more data
on the tweezers.

exact whereabouts

are still unknown,

406
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,733
we've confirmed that within
the next few days,

407
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:48,400
they're gonna be used
at a facility near

Kirigaoka Girls' School.

409
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,067
And there's no arguing
with our source this time.

410

We'll handle this ourselves.

I can't blame you
for being pissed,

but with the regenerative
treatments in this city,

422

your face can be restored.

423
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Besides, without that
nose you're so proud of,

424
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:26,233
do you really think
you can track her?

425
00:20:26,317 --> 00:20:28,483
[RAKKO] I can find her location
by using the black-haired girl's

the slightest bit angry

at that smug little goldilocks.

00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:38,775
She and I had a death match
under extreme circumstances.

She did everything in her
power to get close to me!

That's what friendship
is, isn't it?

432
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:46,192
You said the two of you
had a similar scent,

433

didn't you?

to be relaxed about this!
