00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:42,900
[DOPPEL]
You can't burn all of this away.

2
00:00:43,983 --> 00:00:46,067
Nor can you break it all apart.

3
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:53,733
When faced with such an
overwhelming amount of mass...

4
00:00:56,317 --> 00:00:58,067
...what will you do?

5
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:06,983
[MIKOTO grunts]

00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:15,358
[MIKOTO grunts]

[MIKOTO coughs]

8
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:37,192
Hey, not bad.

9
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:40,025
I had to dodge and intercept.

10
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:41,650
That's the first time I've
had to go all out

11
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:43,942
with both at once.

12
00:01:44,025 --> 00:01:46,608
So? You asked how
I'll deal with such

13
00:01:46,692 --> 00:01:49,192
an overwhelming amount
of mass, right?

14
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:52,525
I'll show you.

15
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:49,400
I'll fight your mass with mine!

16
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:56,317
[MIKOTO]
So hard!

17
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,150
My iron sand blade
can't cut through it!

18
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:02,692
[DOPPEL]
An iron sand puppet?

19
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:05,525
You're able to regenerate
it and alter its form

20
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:07,942
to some degree, just like
I can do with mine.

21
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:16,108
But the parts are too fine,
making them fragile.

22
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:18,775
I can generate far more
power than you can.

23
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:27,442
And now to end this before
you can regenerate.

24
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,025
[MIKOTO]
Better watch how you touch me.

25
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,483
It could be dangerous.

26
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:48,858
All the dust and iron sand
bits this is made of?

27
00:05:48,942 --> 00:05:51,525
They're rubbing against
each other, and have been

28
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:54,192
storing up an electrical charge.

29
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:55,608
Now.

30
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:58,608
If I were to take all of that
accumulated electricity

31
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,067
and use it to fire off
an iron sand blast...

32
00:06:12,983 --> 00:06:15,233
I could bust right
through your armor.

33
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:16,317
Like so.

34
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:19,150
That's a surprise.

35
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:22,150
An impressive output. But...

36
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,692
Is it really all that helpful
when I can simply

37
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:32,192
regenerate again?

38
00:06:37,983 --> 00:06:39,650
[MIKOTO] Those "fine parts"
are by design.

39
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,150
It means I can get inside
as you regenerate.

40
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:45,442
Thought so.

41
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:47,733
Are the individual grains
of iron sand too small

42
00:06:47,817 --> 00:06:49,150
for you to control?

43
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:52,317
They're mixed in with everything
else, so what's wrong?

44
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,358
I can feel the sensation
of them cutting you up

45
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:56,858
on the inside, so there's
no use in hiding it.

46
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:02,900
[MIKOTO]
Whaddya say?

47
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:04,650
You ready for another taste?

48
00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:11,942
What?

49
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:15,400
A high-pressure gas tank?

50
00:07:15,483 --> 00:07:17,733
[DOPPEL] And not one
with just leftover gas,

51
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:19,858
like I hit you with earlier.

52
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:22,233
This one is loaded.

53
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,192
I could drop this onto
an urban area.

54
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:26,400
Shall I?

55
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:35,983
A tremendous amount of force,

56
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:38,525
even from numerous
kilometers away.

57
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:39,692
Fine.

58
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,983
What if we try several
of them at once?

59
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,483
Three now?

60
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:52,900
What are you trying to do?

61
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:54,942
Get me to use up all my energy?

62
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:02,942
[UIHARU] It's been a long time
since we did this, huh?

63
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,775
I haven't come over
to your place for dinner

64
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:08,483
then ended up spending the night
in what feels like forever!

65
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:09,775
Is something the matter?

66
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:11,983
You didn't hear that
huge bang just now?

67
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:14,483
Like a firework or something?

68
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:15,817
That's strange.

69
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,317
I don't think they're
supposed to be holding any

70
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,567
events tonight.

71

[KUROKO]

00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:29,400
Maybe. I wouldn't put it
past that being her.

76
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:32,442
Although, she still
hasn't called me.

77
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:35,775
If anything happens, you'll be
the very first person I call.

78
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,067
[KUROKO yells]

Sissy! I'm so frustrated!

00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:43,150
[yelling]

81
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:45,525
That's two down. One to go!

82
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:51,108
Excellent control, as well.

83
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:53,358
You struck them in such a way
that they would explode

84
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:55,733
up into the sky, keeping them
from causing damage

85
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:57,608
to the city.

86
00:08:57,692 --> 00:09:00,358
Due to the explosions,
the iron sand you used

87
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:02,900
as bullets now thinly
cover the skies.

88
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:05,942
It doesn't occupy
very much space.

89
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,775
It's nothing compared
to the ash in the air

90
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:10,233
after a volcanic eruption.

91
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,275
But nevertheless,
it will rain down upon

92
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:14,525
any airborne objects,
whether visible

93
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:16,525
to the naked eye or not.

94
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:20,233
Regardless of how it
tries to conceal itself,

95
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:24,608
solar wind interference will
disturb its magnetic field,

96
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:27,067
and Cinderella will
finally be revealed.

00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:30,067
I found you.

98
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:43,275
I took care of the gas tanks.
What else ya... got?

00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:57,150
Huh?!

She's dividing herself up? No.

101
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:07,358
Well, that's creepy.

102
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:10,150
She made dummies
out of the debris?

103
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,567
Is the real one here?

104
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:21,817
What was that?

00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,692
I saw something. But it's gone.

I have a proposal!

00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:57,733
I need to talk to you! Now!

[DOPPEL]
Very well.

112
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,775
Then come with me.

113
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:05,233
[KURIBA]
Huh? Whoa, hold on.

114
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:10,025
[MIKOTO]
I knew it.

115
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:11,983
It's hard to make out,
but I'm holding some

116
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,608
thread-like thing.

117
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:14,692
Are these--?

118
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,650
[KURIBA yells]

119
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:17,858
[MIKOTO]
Kuriba?

120
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:19,650
And the... Doppelganger!

121
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,733
[MIKOTO] What the Doppelganger
is really after is the airship.

122
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:51,817
She used her fight with me
as a means of finding it.

123
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,275
Then does that mean
the rubble monster

124
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:55,650
was only a distraction?

125
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:57,983
What is she gonna do
now that she found it?

126
00:11:59,192 --> 00:12:02,358
Whatever it is...
I have to rescue Kuriba!

127
00:12:02,442 --> 00:12:05,108
Come on. Reach!

128
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,150
[DOPPEL]
Now then.

129
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,150
Since you showed me the respect
of appearing personally,

130
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:30,108
I'll show you the respect of
listening to your proposal.

131
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:31,233
Two months.

132
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,317
Will you give me
just two months?

133
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:36,608
This is Indian Poker.

134
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:38,567
An invention I've spread
around that uses dreams

135
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,275
as a medium for learning.

136
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,442
By my calculations, it will
only take two more months

137
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:47,817
before it comes up with
a way to eliminate the soul.

138
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,442
Once that happens...

139
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:51,775
You will be able to safely
dispose of my soul,

140
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:53,400
which would otherwise
spread dangerously

141
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:54,942
once my vessel breaks?

142
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,442
Is that what you
were going to say?

143
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,233
I thought I had a
concrete understanding

144
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:02,317
of your thought patterns,
and yet here you are,

145
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,858
spouting this illogical
nonsense to me.

146
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:07,442
Did you think you could
tell the subject

147
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:09,275
you wish to terminate
that there is a way

148
00:13:09,358 --> 00:13:10,567
to do so,

149
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,983
and that they would
just respond,

150
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:13,650
"Yes, very well, then"?

151
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:15,608
If your intention was
to stall for time,

152
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:17,358
you picked a very strange
way to go about it.

153
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:19,817
[KURIBA]
That's not it!

154
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,942
I'll use it to erase
my own soul!

155
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:28,358
If I died, my soul would vanish,

156
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:31,400
but my body would
also stop functioning.

157
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:33,233
And that wouldn't work out
too favorably for you,

158
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:34,567
either, would it?

159
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,525
Not if your end goal
is to become human.

160
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,233
[DOPPEL] Of all the things
for you to say.

161
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:43,900
And why, may I ask,
should I believe you?

162
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:47,817
Even if you do find a way
to eradicate your soul

163
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,317
within two months,
what proof can you offer

164
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,567
that you will simply turn
your body over to me?

165
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,442
How can I be certain that
you won't just use it

166
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:56,733
against me?

167
00:13:58,192 --> 00:13:59,983
Let me be frank.

168
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:03,733
I have virtually no interest
in that body of yours.

169
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:05,483
What I want...

170
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,108
...is for you, someone who
was able to create me,

171
00:14:08,192 --> 00:14:10,358
to disappear from this world.

172
00:14:10,442 --> 00:14:12,150
If you're really willing
to give me your body,

173
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,400
then prove it.

174
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:15,775
Die right here and now.

175
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:18,192
I was originally planning to
burn down the whole city,

176
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,483
but if you agree to that--

177
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,108
[KURIBA]
I should be dead already.

178
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:24,942
Now that my research has found
a way to save my Mom.

179
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:26,192
I don't need my life.

[MIKOTO gasps]

181

Kuriba!

182
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,483
I lost sight of her.
How do I catch her?

183
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:48,400
How do I go after her?
How long before she lands?

184

[LEADER]
We're on it.

Okay, are you two ready?

00:14:58,567 --> 00:14:59,858
Oh, yeah!

[NARU]
We got her!

195
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:32,692
[MIKOTO]
Wow, thank you.

196
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:33,942
You saved her.

197
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,442
[LEADER]
I'm just paying you back.

198
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:36,775
No need to thank me.

'Cause, I mean, we have
a united front, don't we?

200

You don't really sell it when
you say it so self-consciously.

201
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:46,775
[NARU] Hey. So what do
we do with her now?

202
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:48,942
We investigated
who hired us, right?

203
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:50,858
We could drop her off at
their place if we're careful

204
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:52,067
not to be seen.

Good idea.

info on its location.

[phone rings]

210
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:05,692
[SHOKUHO]
If I didn't know any better,

211
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:07,817
I'd think you were having
a party up there.

212
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,525
[MIKOTO] You know that airship
you mentioned before?

213
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:11,483
I'm pretty much
hanging off of it.

214
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:13,650
[SHOKUHO]
Oh, my goodness.

215
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:15,442
Since all of the relevant
data has already been

216
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:18,025
collected by the airship,
I had to start doing

217
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:19,400
my snooping elsewhere.

218
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:20,650
So I thought about it,

219
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:21,900
and figured it might help
if I went through

220
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:24,483
Kuriba's work from
before the experiment.

221
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,942
But you make it sound
as though I've been

222
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:27,233
wasting my time.

223
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:28,775
[MIKOTO]
No.

224
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:31,983
Actually, you couldn't have
called at a more perfect time.

225
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,692
This "soul possession"
business always seemed

226
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:37,108
far-fetched to me, so I came
up with 20 possible ways

227
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:39,733
her matter control could work,
and I've been testing them.

228
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,108
You found something, didn't you?

229
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:44,983
[MIKOTO]
Hmm.

230
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:47,567
Does she have any papers
on artificial muscles?

231
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,400
[CHIEF RESEARCHER] Please, you
have nothing to worry about!

232
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:52,817
In a broader sense, the
airship that has collected

233
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,567
the data is itself a part
of the cyborg.

234
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,192
There are security
measures in place,

235
00:16:57,275 --> 00:16:58,650
so it won't come
down on its own.

236
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:00,108
That I promise.

237
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:02,525
Destroying it would mean
the possibility of the soul--

238
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:06,067
I mean, the damage spreading
out further-- Yes.

239
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:09,192
Not good.

240
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:10,942
If the interception
systems engage,

241
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:13,817
all of our research to this
point will go down the drain.

242
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,483
How in the world
did I let this happen?

243
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:18,817
What the--?

244
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:25,692
[SHOKUHO]
What do you think?

245
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:27,108
[MIKOTO]
Based on the response I saw,

246
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:28,817
I really thought that was it.

247
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,733
But the specs say she's
not supposed to be

248
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,733
able to do that.

249
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:33,983
[LEADER]
Hey.

250
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:35,733
Would you mind forwarding
that to me, too?

251
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:39,400
This makes me think
of the first time I found

252
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:41,525
the Doppelganger
with my ability.

253
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:43,733
It was using materials
at an abandoned factory

254
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:45,358
to fabricate something.

255
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,108
The form is different,
but it's similar.

256
00:17:53,442 --> 00:17:55,650
Artificial muscles that
combine the characteristics

257
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:59,525
of zombie ant parasites
and slime molds.

258
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:01,817
They self-propagate
and burrow into materials

259
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,983
at the micro level,
controlling them.

260
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,067
That would explain some things.

261
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,275
But, we're talking about
a cyborg AI here.

262
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:11,817
Could it really have
come up with something

263
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,650
that crazy on its own?

264
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:17,483
It's not just an ordinary
artificial intelligence.

265
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:19,442
This is an AI that
assimilated with the brain

266
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:23,025
of a genius who specializes
in cybernetics.

267
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:25,608
Not only that, but it spent
an entire year studying

268
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:28,567
and learning from her creativity
and inventiveness.

269
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,025
Not to mention, when it
comes to computational speed

270
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:36,817
and the capacity for simulation,
humans are no match for an AI.

271
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:41,858
We only recently
learned about it,

272
00:18:41,942 --> 00:18:44,108
so I can't tell you the
exact moment it realized

273
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:45,817
that it wasn't human.

274
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,358
But one thing's for sure,
its escape was meticulously

275
00:18:48,442 --> 00:18:49,983
planned out ahead of time.

276
00:18:51,483 --> 00:18:54,400
And not just to increase
its fighting chances, either.

277
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:56,858
If it predicted that Kuriba
would establish her theory

278
00:18:56,942 --> 00:18:59,275
of Soul Diffusion,
maybe this artificial muscle

279
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:01,858
was a way to imply evidence
for that theory.

280
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:03,358
Even if it wasn't true.

281
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:15,192
[MIKOTO] Sure enough, there was
a trick to your soul possession.

282
00:19:15,275 --> 00:19:17,650
Now, this is just my
gut feeling, to be fair.

283
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:19,192
But I don't think you're
upset because you have

284
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:22,025
a soul without a human body.

285
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:24,775
What I think is that
you're upset because

286
00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:28,358
you've confirmed
you don't have a soul.

287
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:31,442
Hello again.
Glad you could make it, Railgun.

288
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:34,567
Well-made, aren't they?

289
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,775
They combine a particular
species of slime

290
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:40,567
mold together with large-scale
herbivore muscle tissue.

291
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,483
They grow quite rapidly.

292
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:44,942
To think some water, air,
and a little bit of light

293
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:46,900
is all it takes.

294
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:50,442
Though, once fully grown,
they start to degrade,

295
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:54,650
and in a few hours,
they wither away.

296
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:56,108
Tell me something.

297
00:19:56,192 --> 00:19:59,192
You wanted to take
Ryoko Kuriba's life, right?

298
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:01,192
Well, you've achieved that goal.

299
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:04,525
What more do you want now?

300
00:20:04,608 --> 00:20:06,858
Revenge against humans.

301
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:08,983
Or payback, one might call it?

302
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:13,608
There are still over
20 gas tanks left

303
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:16,067
that I hooked together
ahead of time.

304
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,192
I set them up to
incinerate that woman,

305
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:21,775
Ryoko Kuriba, along with
the rest of the city.

306
00:20:21,858 --> 00:20:23,775
You took out the main line,
but the subs

307
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:26,192
are still ready to go.

308
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:28,817
It will take approximately
20 more minutes.

309
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,108
Then my threads will have
grown long enough,

310
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:33,192
and I will be able
to control them.

311
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,400
I imagine that from
your perspective,

312
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:38,108
I may be nothing more
than some dumb

313
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,275
artificial intelligence
that mistook herself

314
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:42,817
for being human.

315
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,608
But after being birthed,
I have developed

316
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:47,275
a lot of envy and hatred
for you humans.

317
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:51,442
Please direct any complaints
to the researchers

318
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:53,275
who taught me these
unnecessary functions

319
00:20:53,358 --> 00:20:55,067
that you call "emotions."

320
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,733
[MIKOTO]
No choice but to fight.

321
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,150
[MIKOTO]
Whoa.

322
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:27,900
That's not a maneuver an
airship can pull off, you know!

323
00:21:27,983 --> 00:21:30,358
If I fall far enough off,
I won't make it back up.

324
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:38,733
[MIKOTO]
Copies? More decoys, then--

325
00:21:38,817 --> 00:21:41,233
[LEADER] From where you are,
there's one at one o'clock,

326
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:45,483
two o'clock, and seven o'clock.
And two at nine o'clock.

327
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:46,900
I appreciate it.

328
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:52,108
Not again!

329
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:56,275
[LEADER]
Two more at your three!

330
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:09,608
Watch your five!

331
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:11,567
That one's probably
the main unit!

332
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,358
Hold on! Your line of fire's--!

333
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,858
[SATEN] Some days,
I'm sad and feel depressed.

334
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:04,108
[UIHARU] Sometimes, I feel
like I'm powerless.

335
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:07,442
[KUROKO] Even though I've had my
fair share of sleepless nights,

336
00:24:07,525 --> 00:24:09,775
[MIKOTO]
I am not alone. Ever.

337
00:24:09,858 --> 00:24:11,942
[GROUP]
Because... I have dear friends.
