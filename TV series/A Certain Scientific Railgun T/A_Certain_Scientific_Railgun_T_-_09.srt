Well, a little while ago,

the stuff was really popular;

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,858
a lot of different companies
were manufacturing it,

53

of those companies

are still in business.

Yes, that's what
I've found as well,

but neither company
has any record of loss

she should have been

broke out or something?

No way.

have been notified about it.

Are you positive this
is the right person?

Well, she did have a hood on,

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,358
[KAMIJO]
Uh... Will do.

162
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:16,858
Thanks, uh...

163
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:18,567
Oh. My name is Saten.

164
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,317
I'm Toma Kamijo.
Thanks again for the help!

165
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,733
I'll be back in an hour!

166
00:08:22,817 --> 00:08:24,233
See ya!

167
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:27,817
Oh, come to think of it,

168
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,400
that closed-down factory
is around here, isn't it?

169
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,192
[KUROKO]
Huh? That can't be right.

170
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:40,108
This says Mitori Kozaku
is deceased!

171
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:41,525
[UIHARU]
Um, excuse me...

172
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:43,942
Do you know if this
data is accurate?

173
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:45,400
It is.

174
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,733
Or at least, it's true the
person you're reading about

175
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,858
was filed under "deceased."

176
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:50,275
[KUROKO]
It's right here.

177
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:52,192
Two months ago
at the reform school.

178
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:54,108
Cause of death: heart failure.

179
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:56,317
Perhaps I was mistaken
about this after all,

180
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,108
and she just has a look-alike.

181
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:01,067
But don't you think some
of the data is a little strange?

182
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,942
[KUROKO]
Huh?

183
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:03,442
I mean, look at the timestamps.

184
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:05,692
If they're accurate, then that
means they cremated her

185
00:09:05,775 --> 00:09:08,650
practically right after
they discovered her body.

186
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,025
[KUROKO]
You're right.

187
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:12,400
There would have been no
time to perform an autopsy.

188
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:14,567
[CLERK A]
Perhaps they didn't do one.

189
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,442
What do you mean?
Why wouldn't they?

190
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:18,192
You know, maybe there
was something fishy

191
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:19,983
about her passing
and they wanted to hide it,

192
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:21,650
so they had to get rid
of the evidence before

193
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:23,358
the cause of death
could be determined.

194
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:24,442
For that matter,

195
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:26,733
maybe your person
isn't even dead!

196
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,067
Uh, I don't mean to be rude,

197
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,483
but do you have any
real basis for that claim?

198
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:32,192
[CLERK A]
Oh, no, of course not.

199
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:35,150
But I do love a good
conspiracy theory.

200
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:37,858
I bet you'd get along pretty
well with our friend Saten.

201
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:39,233
Yeah.

202
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:41,108
[CLERK A]
I've heard this rumor.

203
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:43,817
It says that once in a while,
for whatever reason,

204
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,983
the students who are taken
in by Academy City's

205
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:49,733
reform school end up
disappearing out of the blue.

206
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:52,067
The guards report it
to their superiors,

207
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,858
but it ends up getting
swept under the rug

208
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:55,775
without much of
an investigation.

209
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:57,317
And it's always
the high-level espers

210
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,858
and outstanding students.

211
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:00,567
They're the only
ones who vanish.

212
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,858
[CLERK A] So the story goes that
there's some deal being struck

213
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:08,108
between Academy City
and the offenders,

214
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:09,983
one that allows them
to be secretly discharged

215
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,317
from the facility.

216
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,775
To hide it, the released
are declared dead.

217
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:17,067
I bet it's easier that way. Heh.

218
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,650
But to be fair,
at the end of the day,

219
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,067
it's just a rumor.

220
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:25,733
[UIHARU]
That was a bust.

221
00:10:25,817 --> 00:10:27,192
We didn't prove our theory,
and we're leaving here

222
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:28,983
with even more questions.

223
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:30,150
Even so,

224
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:32,150
if we assume we're
correct for a moment,

225
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:35,317
and it really was Mitori
Kozaku who abducted you,

226
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,358
it means there's someone
with a lot of influence

227
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:38,733
behind all this.

228
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:41,400
Someone who could even
fake a death if they wanted.

229
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:42,775
[UIHARU]
Okay, but if that's true,

230
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:44,317
what would someone
that powerful want

231
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,733
with Ms. Misuzu and me?

232
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:50,483
[KUROKO]
When I think back on it now,

233
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,108
it seems obvious that
Mitori Kozaku's target

234
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:55,025
was that Misaka girl.

235
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:56,275
However...

236
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:58,150
I can't even begin to
imagine what their goal

237
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:00,067
in luring her out was.

238
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,067
It's a mystery.

239
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,442
Wow, you're really
concerned, aren't you?

240
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:05,733
About Misaka?

241
00:11:05,817 --> 00:11:08,108
What do you mean?!
Not more than I should be!

242
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:10,942
I was simply speaking
as a member of Judgment!

243
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:12,775
I am by no means
interested in that girl!

244
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:14,442
I mean, sure, she was
quite caring and thankful

245
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:16,067
for our efforts,
but even so, that--

00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:28,942
I'm so confused!

00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:31,150
Why are our own men
suddenly ambushing us?

Hey!

You just shot at me!

[MIKOTO] Her ability has
them all screwed up.

261
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:47,775
They can't tell friend
from foe anymore.

262
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:50,900
They can't communicate,
let alone cooperate.

263
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:53,692
The entire organization's
broken down.

264
00:11:56,442 --> 00:11:58,817
[MIKOTO]
This floor has the VIP room.

265
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,150
Which means
Gensei Kihara should be...

[GUARD G]
What are you doing there?

267
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,150
You're with Q Squad?

268
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,317
You know you're in
D Squad's section, right?

269
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,358
Oh, yeah, but...

270
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:13,525
It sounded like you guys
had some sort of emergency

271
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,775
going on, so I came to help.

272
00:12:16,858 --> 00:12:19,983
All right, well we've already
had our guest take shelter.

I'll have you stick
with me for now.

Right.

276
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:29,108
[MIKOTO] I could knock
him out right here,

277
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:31,067
but if Gensei is hiding,

278
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,025
I should probably wait
until he takes me to him.

[GUARD G]
This one is sketchy.

Q Squad shouldn't even
be on duty right now,

281

but she hasn't mentioned that.

282
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,858
More importantly, she didn't
respond to the signal.

283
00:12:43,942 --> 00:12:46,775
As soon as I pass
this next corner...

need you to tell me.

Oh, shut up.

Anyway, you haven't
found Gensei?

[SHOKUHO] My men are
investigating as we speak.

Are you sure he hasn't
just gotten away?

I've seized control of
every single escape route.

From the underground passages
to the heliport on the roof.

Speak of the devil.

Looks like Gensei
has been found,

Give it another couple years,
and this place might collapse.

Realistically, any materials
that were left over

Forget what you've seen,

340

and get out of here
without a word.

That sounds like a great idea!

get out of here by myself.

You're just letting
her get away.

[XÓCHITL] Yeah, well the plan's
already in its final stages.

00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:50,567
What's the problem?

Does it even matter
what happens here?

358
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:54,775
It's not like it would
change anything.

00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:56,483
[KOZAKU PUPPET]
Huh?

360
00:15:56,567 --> 00:16:01,025
Maybe, but you have no reason
to let her live either, do you?

[WORKER A]
Hey, everything okay over here?

362
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,192
[KOZAKU PUPPET]
We have an intruder.

363
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:09,233

who ran that way.

[phone buzzes]

368
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:22,483
What is it, Doctor?

369

[MEMBER DOCTOR]
Xóchitl,

370
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,650
listen closely,
this is important.

371
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:27,983
I was finally able to
speak with the members of

372
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:31,067
Academy City's Governing
Board and ask them directly.

373
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,233
It turns out my suspicions
were correct.

374
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:36,108
[XÓCHITL]
What?

Stop it! Come on!

Put me down! Let me go!

377
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:42,817
[KOZAKU PUPPET]
Well, well, well.

378
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,817
We've found ourselves
a lively little rat.

379
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,358
So what do you want
us to do with this kid?

380
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:49,608
[KOZAKU PUPPET]
Hmm...

381
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:51,900
Once you get her to tell
you why she snuck in,

382
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:54,150
dispose of her in
whatever way you want.

383
00:16:54,233 --> 00:16:55,233
[SATEN gasps]

384
00:16:55,317 --> 00:16:56,650
[KOZAKU PUPPET]
I've got places to be.

385
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:58,108
[WORKERS grunt]

386
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,608
[KOZAKU PUPPET]
Hm?

387
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,067
[KOZAKU PUPPET]
What's this?

388
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,317
Are you a traitor
now or something?

389
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,192
Or could it be that you have
some kind of soft spot

390
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:14,983
for the rat behind you?

391
00:17:16,817 --> 00:17:19,692
[XÓCHITL] I don't really care
what happens to this idiot.

392
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:23,067
But it's funny you would
accuse me of being a traitor.

393
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,733
Isn't it, Kozaku?

394
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:28,442
I'm part of the
organization MEMBER.

395
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:29,942
But you know that.

396
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:32,108
After all, you're the one
who delivers our orders

397
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:35,233
from Academy City's
Governing Board.

398
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:38,108
So when you came
to us with new orders,

399
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:40,108
we naturally assumed
they came from the Board,

400
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,733
like they're supposed to.

401
00:17:41,817 --> 00:17:42,983
However,

402
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:46,108
the Doctor had doubts
and did some snooping.

403
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:47,775
And what he found
was that this job

404
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,317
you've assigned us
has nothing to do

405
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,858
with the Governing Board.

406
00:17:51,942 --> 00:17:54,275
You conspired with
an outside client.

407
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:56,817
You used your position
as our go-between,

408
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,025
and then tricked Baba and
me into working for them.

409
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:01,608
Didn't you?

410
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:05,067
To be clear...

411
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,525
I really couldn't
care less who it is

412
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:09,567
you're working for now.

413
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,817
But you've betrayed us.

414
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,025
And that deserves punishment.

415
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:15,317
[KOZAKU PUPPET]
My, my.

416
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,358
If we fight here and now,

417
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:18,233
you'll end up in
pieces on the floor.

418
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:20,442
You realize that, right?

419
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:21,858
[XÓCHITL]
Try me.

420
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:24,650
You may think you can sit
back and watch from afar,

421
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:27,067
but somehow I doubt you're
aware of the full extent

422
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,650
of my techniques.

423
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:33,608
[KOZAKU]
Hmm.

424
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:36,608
I'm about 90% sure
that's a bluff.

425
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:38,275
But it's true,
her unusual powers

426
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:41,150
are unlike anything
I've seen in this city.

427
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:45,067
Maybe she can conjure
up some phenomenon

428
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,150
I can't even imagine.

429
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:50,317
I can't exactly afford any
setbacks at this point, either.

430
00:18:51,483 --> 00:18:53,442
[KOZAKU PUPPET]
Sheesh! Okay, fine.

00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:54,900
I'm out of here.

432
00:18:56,692 --> 00:18:59,025
But a word of warning
before I go.

433
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:01,192
If you've got a home
you can return to,

434
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:04,525
now would be a good time
to get out of Academy City.

435

Unless you'd rather die young.

436

I have no place like that.

And besides.

00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,150
There's someone here
I have to hunt down

00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:41,442
Yes, I've got business that
I just couldn't get out of.

476
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:42,525
[RESEARCHER A]
But sir...

477
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,067
[GENSEI]
All you have to do at the forum

478
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,817
is nod and say "mm-hmm."

479
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,025
[RESEARCHER A]
Okay.

480
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,817
[GENSEI]
Now then.

481
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,108
If you're reading
these memories,

482
00:20:50,192 --> 00:20:52,525
I'm sure you understand
what's happening.

483
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:54,025
[RESEARCHER A]
Sir?

484
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:56,525
[GENSEI] The fact that you're
there, with him right now,

485
00:20:56,608 --> 00:20:59,067
means that you can't possibly
be you-know-where.

486
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,525
[RESEARCHER A]
Um...

487
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:02,733
[GENSEI] And I wonder
if Exterior will be safe

488
00:21:02,817 --> 00:21:05,150
without you there
to watch over it.

Misaki Shokuho.

490
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:07,942
[SHOKUHO]
Why?

491
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:09,733
Why would Gensei do that?

492
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:22,067
[MIKOTO]
Wait up! Shokuho!

493
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,983
At least explain
what's going on!

494
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,067
Floor it!

495
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,317
Get me there now!

[KEITZ]
Coming around, are you?

499
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:44,150
This is in School District 2.

500
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:45,775
You can rest easy.

501
00:21:45,858 --> 00:21:47,858
"Then does that mean
you're the one

502
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:49,983
who found me and
brought me here?"

503
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:53,108
asks Misaka, attempting
to express her gratitude.

504
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,900
Please, all of this
is just part of the job.

505
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,733
You really don't
need to thank me.

Back to sleep again, huh?

509
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:08,775
Oh, great.

510
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:11,192
And here I was,
convinced I'd finally found

511
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:14,025
some respectable work again.

512
00:22:14,108 --> 00:22:16,900
But it looks like things
have taken an ugly turn.

513
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:00,358
[MIKOTO]
So what exactly is "Exterior"?

514
00:24:00,442 --> 00:24:01,525
[SHOKUHO]
What?

515
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:02,775
Oh, you know,
it's that legendary sword.

516
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,233
[MIKOTO]
That's "Excalibur."

--[SHOKUHO] They kill bugs?
--[MIKOTO] "Exterminator."

--[SHOKUHO] Fires?
--[MIKOTO] "Extinguisher!"

[SHOKUHO] Those clip-ins people
use to make their hair longer?

520
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:10,400
[MIKOTO]
Those are extensions-- Hey!

521
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,025
Will you stop messing
around and tell me?
