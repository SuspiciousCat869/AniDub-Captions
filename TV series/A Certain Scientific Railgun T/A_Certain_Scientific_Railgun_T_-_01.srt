00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,233
[GIRL A yelps]

3
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:42,608
[GIRL B]
Hey, watch what you're doing.

4
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:43,650
[BOY A]
Oh, boy.

5
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:47,817
[GIRL A]
It's not working anymore!

6
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,317
[BOY A]
The battery coulda died.

7
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,400
[GIRL B]
But we just charged it earlier.

8
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:54,150
Here, let me see it.

9
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,192
Maybe it really is broken.

10
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:00,150
[GIRL B] What do you
know about it, dummy?

11
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:01,358
Gimme that.

12
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:12,317
Ugh!

13
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,275
All right, I think that's as
much as my telekinesis can do.

14
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:17,025
Then it's my turn! Here goes!

15
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:19,150
Stupid!
You're just gonna burn it!

16
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,192
[BOY A]
Aww.

17
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:21,358
[MIKOTO]
Can I see it?

18
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,983
[BOY A]
What was that?

19
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:26,983
[GIRL B]
She zapped it!

20
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:28,108
So that's what's wrong.

21
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:30,317
Something's disconnected
on the inside.

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,483
Hey. Mind if I help you fix it?

23
00:01:35,358 --> 00:01:36,400
[MIKOTO]
Okay.

24
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:38,275
Use your telekinesis
to hold that wire

25
00:01:38,358 --> 00:01:39,858
against the base plate for me.

26
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:41,192
--[GIRL B] Like this?
--[MIKOTO] Mhm!

27
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:43,692
Now, use the heat
of your pyrokinesis

28
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:45,525
to melt this solder, all right?

29
00:01:45,608 --> 00:01:46,692
[BOY A]
I'll try.

30
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:47,775
[MIKOTO]
There you go!

31
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,692
[BOY A chuckles]
Awesome!

32
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:53,442
--It's fixed!
--Thanks a whole lot--

33
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:55,733
[GIRL B]
Huh?

34
00:01:55,817 --> 00:01:57,233
[BOY A]
She was here a second ago.

35
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,067
[GIRL B] Hey, she was wearing
a Tokiwadai Middle School

36
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,483
uniform, right?

37
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:02,025
[BOY A] Whoa, you mean that
famous all-girls school?

38
00:02:02,108 --> 00:02:04,692
[GIRL A]
Thank you, shorts-wearing lady.

39
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,525
[MIKOTO] I really do make
too many pit-stops!

40
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:10,942
[CHAIRMAN A]
Academy City.

41
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:14,025
It occupies a whopping
one-third of Tokyo,

42
00:02:14,108 --> 00:02:17,233
with a total population
of 2.3 million.

43
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:19,858
Eighty percent of that
figure is students.

44
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:21,900
They devote themselves
to nurturing and improving

45
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:23,442
their abilities daily.

46
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:27,483
And at the top are the Level 5s.

47
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:30,817
Expansive as the city may be,

48
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,775
only seven people
meet the requirements

49
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:34,900
to be considered a Level 5.

50
00:02:34,983 --> 00:02:39,442
And these seven outliers
are officially our new targets.

51
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:40,692
[MEMBER A]
Are you serious?

52
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:42,525
You know who these
people are, right?

53
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:44,692
Practically every one
of them is a deviant!

54
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:46,400
[MEMBER B]
I have my concerns, too.

55
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:48,608
I've heard some are involved
with unsavory groups

56
00:02:48,692 --> 00:02:51,400
with no regard for the law.

57
00:02:51,483 --> 00:02:54,067
Do you really think
we could win them over?

58
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,358
I dunno, but this will
be transmitted beyond

59
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,483
just Academy City;

60
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:59,400
the whole world
will be watching.

61
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:01,275
So to put on a
real demonstration,

62
00:03:01,358 --> 00:03:03,192
the higher-ups made it
clear that we have to use

63
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:05,192
top-class espers.

64
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:06,317
They're killin' me here!

65
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,358
If the decision has
come from above,

66
00:03:08,442 --> 00:03:09,817
we have no choice.

67
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,192
At the very least,
we need two Level 5s

68
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,650
to take the athlete's pledge.

69
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,067
That's the bare minimum.

70
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,150
Make use of all your connections
to negotiate with them!

71
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,942
[SATEN]
Hey! The Daihasei Festival!

72
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:27,150
Oh, man.

73
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:30,025
Almost forgot about it,
but now I'm excited!

74
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:32,400
It's crazy to think all of
Academy City's schools

75
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:34,733
come together for seven
entire days and hold

76
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:36,400
a sports festival!

77
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,942
There's nothing like it
anywhere else, that's for sure.

78
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:41,025
[UIHARU]
Uh-huh.

79
00:03:41,108 --> 00:03:42,775
[SATEN]
Uiharu?

80
00:03:42,858 --> 00:03:45,983
Sorry, it's just that if
we're holding a big festival,

81
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:48,108
a lot of people will be
entering Academy City

82
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:50,233
from who-knows-where.

83
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:53,567
As a member of Judgment,
I have to remain vigilant.

84
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,192
And besides...

85
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:58,067
If something bad were
to happen because I wasn't

86
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,942
careful enough, I'd...

87
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:03,650
[SATEN]
Uiha... ru!

88
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,608
--[UIHARU yells]
--[SATEN] Oh, polka-dots!

89
00:04:07,817 --> 00:04:09,567
The classics never
go out of style.

90
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,400
What did you have to go
and do that for, Saten?

91
00:04:12,483 --> 00:04:14,317
[SATEN] 'Cause at the very
least, when you're off duty

92
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,775
from Judgment, you could
stand to relax a little.

93
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,442
Everyone knows you're always
trying your hardest.

94
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:22,733
But don't overdo it, okay?

95
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:24,025
Thank you, Saten.

96
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:26,858
[MIKOTO]
Hey! Uiharu! Saten!

97
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:27,983
Sorry I'm late!

98
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:34,067
[knocking]

99
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:37,942
--Sissy, it's y--!
--[SATEN] Hello!

100
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:40,233
So how are you feeling, Shirai?
Any better today?

101
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:41,858
Thought we'd come to
check up on you.

102
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:43,442
[KUROKO] Yeah, yeah,
all right, thanks for comi--

103
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:44,692
[MIKOTO]
How's it going, Kuroko?

104
00:04:44,775 --> 00:04:46,442
Doing any better?

105
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:48,608
[KUROKO]
Sissy!

106
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:53,150
[UIHARU]
Huh?

107
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:55,775
Wait, the athlete's pledge
at the opening ceremonies?

108
00:04:55,858 --> 00:04:57,608
For the Daihasei Festival?

109
00:04:57,692 --> 00:04:59,108
They want you for it, Sissy?

110
00:04:59,192 --> 00:05:00,442
[MIKOTO]
Mm-hmm.

111
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:02,483
One of the teachers
grabbed me as I was leaving

112
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:03,858
and asked.

113
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:06,233
[WATANABE] Now, Misaka,
you have prior experience

114
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:08,650
doing demonstrations
in Russia, right?

115
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,567
There are those among our
staff who believe you would be

116
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,525
a fitting representative
of Tokiwadai Middle School.

117
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:15,442
[MIKOTO]
Yeah?

118
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:17,775
[WATANABE] Of course,
the final decision is yours.

119
00:05:18,858 --> 00:05:19,900
[MIKOTO]
So...

120
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:21,858
Do you realize how
incredible that is?

121
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:24,025
The Daihasei Festival's
opening ceremony

122
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:27,150
is supposed to be broadcast
to the entire planet!

123
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:29,733
Misaka's gonna be an
international superstar!

124
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:32,400
As she should be.
Is anyone surprised?

125
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:35,858
Yeah, that sorta thing
isn't exactly my style.

126
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:36,983
[SATEN]
Come on!

127
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,108
I'm sure your parents
would be psyched

128
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:40,108
to see you do it, wouldn't they?

129
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:42,733
Mmm... I'm not so
sure they would.

130
00:05:42,817 --> 00:05:44,942
People all over the world
are going to start falling

131
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:46,900
for you now, but I suppose
I'll find some way

132
00:05:46,983 --> 00:05:49,192
to deal with not having
you all to myself.

133
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:50,525
I'm sorry?

134
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:52,567
Well the three of us
will make sure to be there.

135
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,983
[SATEN]
Wait.

136
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,775
Shirai, you aren't still gonna
be stuck in this bed?

137
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:57,108
[KUROKO]
Nope.

138
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:59,150
I'm already scheduled
to be discharged by then.

139
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,608
Though as I'm sure
you can imagine,

140
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:02,192
I won't be able to compete.

141
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,067
It's such a pity that
all that training I did

142
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,400
with Sissy will go to waste.

143
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:09,442
Oh, yeah. "Training."

144
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:11,150
[MIKOTO]
Easy, Kuroko!

145
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,567
Will you chill out? Get off!

146
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:16,775
Yeah. Well, nothing
we can do about it.

147
00:06:16,858 --> 00:06:18,192
[KUROKO]
Oh, no.

148
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:20,400
I refuse to leave you stuck
on the sidelines, Sissy.

149
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:22,525
You just let good old
Kuroko take care of this

150
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:23,692
for you.

151
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,858
[SATEN]
Well, then, like Uiharu said,

152
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:27,608
let's all go and
show our support!

153
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:29,733
While do I appreciate
the invitation,

154
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:31,608
it's likely I'll have
to catch up on my work

155
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,567
with Judgment then.

156
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,733
Shirai, you're going
back to work so soon?

157
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:37,275
Yes, of course I am.

158
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:38,608
Once I'm out of the hospital,

159
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:41,608
there are any number
of things I can do to help.

160
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,108
[SATEN grunts]

161
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:48,900
Man. I sure am glad Shirai's
in good spirits, y'know?

162
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:50,400
Oh. Yeah!

163
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:51,900
Me too.

164
00:06:51,983 --> 00:06:55,233
But I gotta say, it seemed like
she was only acting happy.

165
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:56,775
But why do that?

166
00:06:56,858 --> 00:07:01,108
[SATEN] Well, to keep us all
from worrying if I had to guess.

167
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:03,733
You're right.
That does sound like her.

168
00:07:03,817 --> 00:07:06,400
Guess so. All right!
I'm gonna try hard too

169
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:09,400
so Shirai doesn't have
to worry about me, either!

170
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:11,150
[SATEN]
You always try hard, Uiharu.

171
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:12,442
You gonna try even harder?

172
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:13,608
[UIHARU]
Yes!

173
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:15,233
Maybe I should do
something for her, too--

174
00:07:15,317 --> 00:07:16,733
Why bother?

175
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:18,400
[UIHARU] Come on, you know
that as long as Shirai has you,

176
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:21,108
she couldn't possibly
want anything else.

177
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:22,775
[MIKOTO] I'm sure that's not
true; she must need

178
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:23,983
something else.

179
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:28,650
[KONGO]
Is that Misaka?

180
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:29,775
[MIKOTO]
Oh, Kongo.

181
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:32,233
Wannai and Awatsuki, too. Hey!

182
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,400
Good afternoon.
I hope you're well.

183
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:35,442
[AWATSUKI]
Nice to see you.

184
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:36,942
Yeah, same.

185
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:38,358
[KONGO]
Is something the matter?

186
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:41,733
Huh? Oh, no, not really.

187
00:07:41,817 --> 00:07:43,900
Well, if there is
something troubling you,

188
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:46,317
by all means,
turn to your finest partner,

189
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,983
Kongo Mitsuko for help!

190
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:48,942
Partner?

191
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:50,233
Hey, Kongo!

192
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:52,400
[AWATSUKI]
You can't talk about that!

193
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:55,817
Huh? How could I
make such a blunder?

194
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,150
[MIKOTO]
Kuroko did?

195
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:59,650
Yeah. It was yesterday,
when we went to visit her.

196
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:01,150
[AWATSUKI] We must have
just missed each other

197
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:02,733
if you went there, too.

198
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:05,108
Yes, and that's when
Shirai asked me to pair up

199
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:07,525
with you for the festival
so you can compete

200
00:08:07,608 --> 00:08:08,900
without her.

201
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:10,400
She said she would
tell you herself,

202
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:12,358
but then I came along
and ruined it.

203
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:13,817
Me and my big mouth.

204
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,400
[MIKOTO] So that's what Kuroko
meant in the hospital.

205
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:17,900
[WANNAI]
Something wrong?

206
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:20,192
Mm-mm. It's nothing.

207
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:22,150
I second the request for help.

208
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:24,942
I appreciate it, Kongo.

209
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:27,150
Yes. Right! As do I!

210
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:29,608
I appreciate you
working with me.

211
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:31,525
I'll have to go and
thank Kuroko, too,

212
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:32,858
since she made this happen.

213
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:34,900
Oh! In that case...

214
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:39,317
[MIKOTO] Huh. I don't know
any of these shops.

215
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:42,150
That looks tasty!

216
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:44,858
[HOKAZE]
Queen?

217
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:47,442
Well lookie here,
is that Misaka?

218
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:50,067
You know that you can't
read that on school grounds.

219
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,233
Do you want to get in trouble?

220
00:08:52,317 --> 00:08:54,025
For someone important
enough to be chosen

221
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:56,150
for the Daihasei
athlete's pledge,

222
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:59,192
you've got a
pretty brash attitude.

223
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:02,067
You say that like I've already
accepted their offer.

224
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,025
I'm sure they came to you
for the same reason, right?

225
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:07,192
Level 5, Misaki Shokuho?

226
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:10,317
Ah? Wait, did they really?
My queen?

227
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,275
Please be quiet.

228
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:13,983
Maybe.

229
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,983
But I don't feel as though
I'd get anything out of it.

230
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:18,483
Which is why I'll step aside

231
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:20,983
and make room for you
to take center stage.

232
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,108
What is your problem?

233
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:28,983
Your E-M barrier.
Such a nuisance.

234
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:31,108
It keeps my Mental Out's
tampering powers

235
00:09:31,192 --> 00:09:32,692
from working on you at all.

236
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,483
I know!

237
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:38,858
Perhaps some endorsements
would be helpful.

238
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:45,567
Everyone? What do you say?

239
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,108
[STUDENTS]
We think that Misaka

240
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:49,567
would be very fitting
for the athlete's pledge.

241
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,442
[SHOKUHO]
Just kidding.

242
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:58,942
Hello! I didn't notice
you there, Misaka.

243

My, that's weird.
When did I stand up?

244
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:03,317
Unbelievable.

00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,775
There's something
wrong with you.

246
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:06,942
You did that to all these
people just to mess with me

247
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:08,150
a little?

248
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,858
You can say whatever you like.

249
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,775
This is simply who I am.

250
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:13,233
Unfortunately.

251
00:10:13,317 --> 00:10:14,900
Now stop harassing me.

252
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:17,442
I'm well aware of how
much you dislike me.

253
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:18,983
No need for the reminder.

254
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:23,775
It may be more than
just simple "dislike."

[HELMETED WOMAN]
That's right.

259
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,317
[MUGINO] Why would someone
who works for the underground

260
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,650
of Academy City want
to show her face publicly?

[FRENDA]
What is it?

262
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,650
[HELMETED WOMAN]
Does it matter?

263
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,150
Your public persona
could be an idol

264
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:43,483
as long as your real one is
a "hunter in the darkness."

At least you've got your
looks going for you.

enjoying this, aren't you?

Sorry I'm kinda late.

277
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,775

No, nothing like that.
He just went a bit crazy.

He very nearly dragged me into
his little fit of rage, too.

281
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:19,983
Kakine did this?

282
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,983
Right after we got a call
from our usual agent.

283
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:25,442
They asked if he'd take
the Daihasei Festival

athlete's pledge.

285

[YOBOU]
Really?

286
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:30,942
[HEART MEASURE]
And, of course, he refused,

287
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:33,400
but they wouldn't take
no for an answer.

288
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:35,442
And when his patience ran out...

289
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,067
Gimme a freakin' break.

290
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,025
The Daihasei Festival
is a game for kids

291
00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:42,192
who still think things
like "effort" and "hope"

292
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:44,025
will help them
accomplish anything.

Their response was,

294
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:49,233
"But with your power, you appeal
to those very same kids."

barely clinging to life.

316
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:47,150
I don't understand
why this so hard.

317
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,525
We're not asking them
to do that much.

318
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:50,983
[MEMBER A]
Sir?

319
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:53,025
What about the
sixth-ranked Level 5?

320
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:55,817
[MEMBER B] The thing is, all of
our intel on them points us

321
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,775
to completely different people.

322
00:12:57,858 --> 00:12:59,400
Should we just start
negotiating with everyone

323
00:12:59,483 --> 00:13:00,525
on the list?

324
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:01,942
No, that's okay.

325
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,858
I get the feeling we should
stay away from that one.

326
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:07,150
Then that leaves...
only three left.

327
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,483
Ugh.

328
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,108
A line?

329
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:12,358
That's some effective
advertising.

330
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:13,275
Huh?

331
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:14,775
What's up?

332
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:16,233
[STUDENT A] I thought I saw
that girl inside the store.

333
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:18,858
[STUDENT B] Really? Maybe
she has a doppelganger.

334
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,608
[MIKOTO gasps]

335
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:25,150
[MIKOTO]
So?

336
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:26,567
Are you gonna explain
to me what you're doing

337
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,692
out and about?

338
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:29,150
You're supposed to be
in the hospital.

339
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:31,483
"What is Misaka doing
out and about?

340
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:32,983
Does it look like
something other than

341
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:34,817
purchasing a cake and leaving?"

342
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,150
asks Misaka,
presenting a question.

343
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,650
[MIKOTO]
No, I mean...

344
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:41,650
"We heard a rumor about
some delicious cake,

345
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,692
had a contest,

346
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:47,192
and Misaka was delegated the
task of buying one, and did,"

347
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:50,650
says Misaka, sweating, recalling
the fierce competition.

348
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:52,483
[MIKOTO]
You're pretty independent, huh?

349
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:54,608
[STUDENT C]
Oh, how cute! Twins!

350
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:55,942
Must be middle-schoolers.

351
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:57,567
[STUDENT C]
And with matching uniforms?

352
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,108
So adorable.

353
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:01,942
[MISAKA SISTER A] Although, as
we are your clones, Big Sister,

354
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:04,067
when we are occasionally
spotted in your sphere

355
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,317
of activity,

356
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,400
it must be quite the
inconvenience for you.

357
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:09,358
From here on--

358
00:14:09,442 --> 00:14:10,900
[MIKOTO]
You got that right.

359
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:14,400
It gets to be a pain having
to explain it, but it's okay.

360
00:14:14,483 --> 00:14:15,983
How could I be mad?

361
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:19,358
I did promise that I would help
you all find a meaning in life,

362
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,442
didn't I?

363
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,233
Yes, Big Sister.

364
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:26,692
So... I'm going to start
by buying a cake myself--

365
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:28,108
"By the way.

366
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:30,733
In order to purchase any
of the items in that store,

367
00:14:30,817 --> 00:14:32,442
you will require
a numbered ticket,

368
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:34,442
which I believe have
all been distributed.

369
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:36,442
Are you in possession
of one of those?"

370
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:39,358
inquires Misaka, doubtfully.

371
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:41,233
You need a ticket? [groans]

372
00:14:41,317 --> 00:14:42,942
No sweets for me.

373
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:44,317
[MISAKA SISTER A]
Incidentally...

374
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,650
There are four cakes
in this bag for the Misakas

375
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,317
who are waiting at the hospital.

376
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,775
However, for this Misaka,
who came to acquire them,

377
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,775
there exists twice
the necessary confection.

378
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:55,900
An extra.

379
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:02,317
[SATEN] Wow, things are
sure getting festive, huh?

380
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,067
[UIHARU] Yeah, apparently,
they're doing a bunch of

381
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,525
test runs all over
the place today.

382
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:07,817
Konori said to be careful

383
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,692
since there's bound to be
people causing trouble

384
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:10,775
in all the fuss.

385
00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:12,192
So let's keep an eye out.

386
00:15:12,275 --> 00:15:13,650
[PASSERBY B]
Hey! Fight, fight!

387
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:16,692
Some guys are gettin'
into it in the plaza!

388
00:15:16,775 --> 00:15:19,400
Like I told ya!
My boys were here first!

389
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:21,275
Oh, don't even try to pull that!

390
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:23,275
We were clearly here before you!

391
00:15:23,358 --> 00:15:24,817
[CHEER SQUAD]
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

392
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,400
[CHEER CAPTAIN A] We've been
waitin' here since yesterday!

393
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:29,775
[SATEN] Ugh.
They're really going at it.

394
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:31,025
[STUDENT E]
This is getting out of hand.

395
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:33,067
Maybe we should call Antiskill.

396
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:35,067
[CHEER CAPTAIN A]
This is going nowhere!

397
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,650
[CHEER CAPTAIN B]
I could say the same thing!

398
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:38,233
Then let's settle it!

399
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:39,942
The stronger team gets to stay!

400
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:41,192
Bring it on!

401
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:44,692
Tell me, buddy,
can you wave a flag this big?

402
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:48,525
[CHEER CAPTAIN B yells]

403
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:51,150
[CHEER CAPTAIN A grunts]

404
00:15:53,358 --> 00:15:55,608
[CHEER CAPTAIN B] Your strength
is only because of your ability!

405
00:15:55,692 --> 00:15:57,483
However, I know that
you're unable to move

406
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,150
while using it!

407
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,858
[CHEER CAPTAIN B] That's right,
we did recon on you!

408
00:16:01,942 --> 00:16:02,942
[MEMBER A]
What the--?

409
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,358
[CHEER CAPTAIN B]
As for my ability,

410
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:07,442
it allows me to conjure
a brief gust of wind!

411
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,150
I wonder, can you make
this many flags flutter

412
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:12,942
at the same time?

413
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:14,192
[CHEER CAPTAIN A growls]

414
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:16,858
They both have fairly
niche abilities.

415

Right, Uiha--?

00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:21,483
[UIHARU]
Excuse me!

417
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:22,900
[CHEER CAPTAINS]
Huh?

418
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,108
[UIHARU]
You...

419
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,400
You guys are bothering
all the people here.

420
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:28,025
So will you please
stop fighting?

421
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:29,900
[CHEER CAPTAIN A]
Huh? Who the hell are you?

422
00:16:29,983 --> 00:16:31,692
[CHEER CAPTAIN B] Under what
authority and for what reason

423
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:35,150
are you trying to
rein in our activities?

424
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:38,192
It's because I'm with Judgment!

425
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:40,400
Are you kidding?! Come on!

426
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:41,650
[CHEER CAPTAIN B]
What are we doing wrong?

427
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:43,275
This is a disagreement
between men!

428
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:44,983
You have no right to stop us!

429
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:46,233
In other words,

430
00:16:46,317 --> 00:16:48,775
keep your pretty little
mug outta this, girl!

431
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:49,858
Watch out!

432
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:59,025
[UIHARU] It's got nothing
to do with whether I'm

433
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:00,692
a girl or not!

434
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:01,858
[SOGIITA]
That's right!

435
00:17:08,442 --> 00:17:10,317
[SOGIITA]
You're correct.

436
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,608
What's important isn't
what your gender is.

437
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:14,692
[UIHARU]
Huh?

438
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:16,358
It's if you have guts!

439
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:17,525
'Scuse me?

440
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:20,108
[MEMBER C]
Wait, he hasn't been to school?

441
00:17:20,192 --> 00:17:21,942
No, not for a few days.

442
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:24,108
[MEMBER C]
So, are you sure he's all right?

443
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:25,942
Yeah, he just does this.

444
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:27,900
It's usually because he's
off helping someone,

445
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:29,733
so I can't get upset.

446
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:31,775
Oh, but before you
start worrying,

447
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:34,275
he accepts your request,
mark my words.

448
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:36,983
Huh? I kinda need
to hear it from him.

449
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:39,733
He's the kind of guy who can
never turn down a favor.

450
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:43,400
That's just how he is.

451
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:45,150
It's Gunha Sogiita's way.

452
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,608
[CHEER CAPTAIN A]
Stop that!

453
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,567
You can't just kick a cheer
squad's precious flag!

454
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,692
How dare you!

455
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:54,400
That's a direct challenge
to every man

456
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:55,983
on a cheer squad!

457
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:57,983
[SOGIITA]
Sounds good to me.

458
00:17:58,067 --> 00:17:59,567
[SATEN]
What the--?

459
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,525
[SOGIITA] Go on, show me just
what kind of guts you've got!

460
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:07,692
Amazing...

461
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:11,942
...Punch!

462
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:19,442
[STUDENT F] Huh? Did you
hear that or am I crazy?

463
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:20,775
[STUDENTS chattering]

464
00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:22,775
[STUDENT G] Well we clearly
all heard something.

465
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:24,775
[SOGIITA]
Mm-hmm. That's about right.

466
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,275
What have you done?
Look at this place!

467
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,025
And you can't just hit people!

468
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,358
Oh. It's all good.

469
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:33,275
I made sure to
hold back a little bit.

470
00:18:33,358 --> 00:18:35,567
No matter how gutless
those guys are,

471
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,483
it'd take more
than this to kill 'em.

472
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:39,233
More than this?

473
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:40,775
[SOGIITA]
Compared to them,

474
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:43,275
you've got some considerable
guts, y'know that?

475
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:44,233
[UIHARU]
Huh?

476
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:45,525
[SOGIITA]
Welp. See ya around!

477
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:47,108
--[UIHARU gasps]
--[SATEN] Huh?

478
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:50,525
--[SOGIITA laughs]
--[SATEN] Uiharu!

479
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:53,275
[CHEER SQUAD groans]

480
00:18:53,358 --> 00:18:55,525
[SATEN]
Hold on! I'm coming, too!

481
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:56,858
[STUDENT H]
What was that just now?

482
00:18:56,942 --> 00:18:58,192
[STUDENT I]
An explosion, right?

483
00:18:58,275 --> 00:18:59,400
Incredible.

484
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:00,733
[STUDENT J]
Hey, that thing's not stable.

485
00:19:00,817 --> 00:19:02,775
[STUDENT K] That Judgment
girl is still in there!

486
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:08,400
[SATEN]
Be careful, Uiharu!

487
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:10,858
[UIHARU] It's okay,
I've contacted Antiskill!

488
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,275
Don't put yourself at risk;
we'll handle this!

489
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:14,692
[SATEN]
Never mind about me!

490
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:16,108
Come on, let's hurry!

491
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:17,358
[UIHARU]
Uh, okay!

492
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:20,192
Look out!

493
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:23,233
[MIKOTO]
Get down!

494
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:24,608
[SATEN, UIHARU gasp]

495
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:36,900
[SATEN, UIHARU gasp]

496
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:40,900
Amazing! That girl.

497
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:43,192
Wearing a Tokiwadai uniform.

498
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:44,567
With that ability.

499
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:54,817
She's gotta be the third-ranked
Tokiwadai's Railgun!

500
00:19:56,692 --> 00:19:58,983
She'd be perfect for
the athlete's pledge!

501
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:00,317
Maybe I can talk to her.

502
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,483
[WATANABE]
About that.

503
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:03,942
Ms. Watanabe?

504
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:06,400
While Misaka's definitely
a good student,

505
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:08,275
she's often
caught up in trouble.

506
00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:10,900
Likely because of her notoriety,
but who knows?

507
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:12,692
Originally I was planning
to let her decide

508
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:15,067
whether to take
the pledge or not,

509
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,442
but given the possibility
of it creating more problems,

510
00:20:18,525 --> 00:20:20,650
I think we should forget
we ever said anything.

511
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:21,692
Huh?!

512
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:23,900
--Whoa.
--Oh!

513
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:26,150
Looks like Antiskill has
arrived. That was quick!

514
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:28,650
I'm gonna go report to them.
I'll see you later!

515
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:29,650
'Kay!

516
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:30,858
See you around!

517
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:31,858
All right.

518
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:33,942
We should probably
get going, too.

519
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,317
So are you gonna go
see Shirai again today?

520
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,525
Yeah.

521
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:40,400
And I've got a gift
to deliver to... her.

522
00:20:40,483 --> 00:20:41,442
Oh.

523
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:44,775
[SHOKUHO sighs]

524
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:46,608
[HOKAZE] It was only a matter
of time before our queen

525
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:48,275
got a proper offer.

526
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:49,608
[SHOKUHO]
Hmm.

527
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:52,442
I did tell Misaka it
wasn't worth my time.

528
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:55,150
What good would my word be
if I accepted now?

529
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,733
[KEITZ] I don't see any
reason to decline the offer.

530
00:20:57,817 --> 00:21:01,150
Not to mention, having you
in the public's eye

531
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:03,233
makes my job easier, as well.

532
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:07,608
[HOKAZE]
Excuse me, but who might you be?

533
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:08,692
[phone beeps]

534
00:21:08,775 --> 00:21:11,275
My, my.
Speaking to me out of nowhere.

535
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:12,858
Can't have that.

536
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:16,858
It makes more work for me
having to alter memories.

537
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,817
So, don't be coy.

538
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,692
Have you found anything out yet?

539
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:21,692
I have.

540
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:24,858
Then by all means, tell me...

541
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:27,650
...about Mikoto Misaka's clones.

542
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:29,900
About the "Sisters."

543
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:31,483
[SATEN]
Huh?

544
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:33,692
Wait, so you're not gonna take
the athlete's pledge anymore?

545
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:34,942
[MIKOTO]
Nope.

546
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:36,775
They said they settled
on someone else, so...

547
00:21:36,858 --> 00:21:38,067
Those fools.

548
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,525
They don't know
what they're missing.

549
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:42,192
No one in the world is more
suitable than you, Sissy.

550
00:21:42,275 --> 00:21:45,317
Hey, it's no big deal.
Forget about it.

551
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
See this?

552
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:48,983
Apparently, it's quite
the hot item.

553
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:50,900
Sissy, did you...

554
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:52,608
Yeah. Don't mention it.

555
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:55,608
Sissy--

556
00:21:59,442 --> 00:22:00,650
[KUROKO]
Heh...

557
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:01,942
[MEMBER A]
Well, we did it!

558
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:02,900
[MEMBER C]
Finally.

559
00:22:02,983 --> 00:22:04,108
[MEMBER B]
Thank goodness.

560
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:07,400
[CHAIRMAN A]
Yes. You've done well, everyone.

561
00:22:07,483 --> 00:22:08,942
But...

562
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:11,775
...why do I have an awfully
bad feeling about this?

563
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,733
[UIHARU]
Sorry I'm so late!

564
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:17,442
It took longer than I expected
to explain everything.

565
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:18,900
Hello?

566
00:22:18,983 --> 00:22:21,025
Sissy. I can explain.

567
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:22,733
This is just, uh...

568
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:25,358
[MIKOTO]
Kuroko!

569
00:22:25,442 --> 00:22:26,650
[KUROKO screams]

570
00:23:58,275 --> 00:24:00,900
[SATEN] Yes! The Daihasei
Festival is starting!

571
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,942
--[UIHARU] It sure is.
--[KUROKO growls]

572
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,442
[SATEN]
Shirai, is something wrong?

573
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:06,192
[UIHARU] It looks like the
frustration of not being able

574
00:24:06,275 --> 00:24:08,858
to compete alongside
Misaka is finally setting in.

575
00:24:08,942 --> 00:24:10,942
[SATEN] But wasn't she the
one who got her Kongo?

576
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:12,025
[KUROKO]
Sissy!
