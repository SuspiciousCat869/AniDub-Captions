00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,692
[keyboard clicking]

2
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:37,567
[door opens]

3
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,817
[MIKOTO]
I'm back!

4
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,775
I brought your uniform
over to the cleaners.

5
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:42,650
Oh, and they had
your winter uniform,

6
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:44,858
so I grabbed that, too.

7
00:00:44,942 --> 00:00:47,150
[KUROKO]
I really appreciate it, Sissy.

8
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:49,442
Apologies if I put you
out at all.

9
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:50,733
[MIKOTO]
It's no problem!

10
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,567
And you deserve it
for saving that girl's life.

11
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,150
Pretty impressive.

12
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:56,567
[KUROKO]
Yes, well...

13
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,483
Hm? What's the matter?

14
00:00:58,567 --> 00:00:59,733
Did something happen?

15
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:02,650
Kind of. Um, let me explain.

16
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,692
[MIKOTO]
Wow. A precognitive app, huh?

17
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:09,275
Yes.

18
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:11,275
We don't quite understand all
of the specifics yet, though.

19
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:13,150
So starting tomorrow,
my work is likely to get

20
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:14,900
a bit more hectic.

21
00:01:14,983 --> 00:01:16,317
I can see why.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,567
Is there anything I can do
to help you out?

23
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,567
Oh, Sissy, you care!

24
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,400
Just knowing you're
concerned for my wellbeing

25
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,025
is more than enough for me.

26
00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:25,483
But whatever you do,

27
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:28,192
please do not stick your nose
in without asking first.

28
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:30,358
Reminder:
You're just a civilian.

29
00:01:30,442 --> 00:01:32,150
I'm fully aware of that.

30
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:35,358
[KUROKO]
Incidentally, Sissy, question.

31
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:37,108
Are you planning to use
one of those cards

32
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:38,358
when you turn in for the night?

33
00:01:38,442 --> 00:01:41,192
By cards you mean Indian Poker?

34
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:43,817
No, I think I've had enough
of that for a while.

35
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,942
Today was kind of a nightmare.

36
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:48,108
Well, I'm sorry you
had a bad day.

37
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:49,775
But then, yes, I agree.

38
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:51,233
I think that would be
for the best.

39
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:52,650
[MIKOTO]
Why?

40
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,067
Did you have a bad experience
with those cards too,

41
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,108
or something?

42
00:01:55,192 --> 00:01:56,942
[KUROKO]
Yes, you could say that.

43
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,650
[SATEN]
Huh?

44
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:07,067
Hold on, didn't you say
you had the day off today?

45
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,983
Originally, I was scheduled to.

46
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:10,483
But remember yesterday
how you told me

47
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:12,608
about that app that shows
the times of accidents,

48
00:02:12,692 --> 00:02:14,608
and some of them
haven't happened yet?

49
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:17,442
Well, now I have to be on patrol
so we can investigate it.

50
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:18,692
Oh, man, really?

51
00:02:18,775 --> 00:02:20,108
[phone buzzing]

52
00:02:20,192 --> 00:02:21,942
[UIHARU]
Oh, it's from Shirai.

53
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:24,067
Wow, she's really rushing me!

54
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,400
Sorry we couldn't hang out
like we planned to.

55
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:28,608
[SATEN]
It's fine, I get it! Good luck!

56
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:30,733
[UIHARU]
Thanks. See ya!

57
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,025
Hello? Yeah, I'm on my way now!

58
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:36,567
[SATEN] It feels like forever
since we got some food together.

59
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,275
I was looking forward to it.

60
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,650
[SATEN humming]

61
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,108
[SATEN]
Oh, there it is!

62
00:04:30,358 --> 00:04:32,358
[EMPLOYEE A]
That'll be 1,088 yen.

63
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:34,192
[SATEN]
Okay, out of 1,100 please.

64
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,025
[FRENDA screams]

65
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:41,192
Here too...
They're completely out!

66
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:42,900
[EMPLOYEE B]
I am so sorry about that.

67
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,608
We just sold our last one.
Stockroom and all.

68
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:47,108
This is so unfair.

69
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:48,775
I've been all over
the city today,

70
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:51,192
how is it that every store
is completely sold out?

71
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:54,067
Heh... It was featured
on a show last night.

72
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,567
They kept talking
about how good it is

73
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,692
for your looks.

74
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:59,192
That's why I picked some up.

75
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:00,525
[FRENDA screams]

76
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:02,317
Hey! What are you doing?

77
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,192
Give me...

78
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:05,108
[SATEN]
Huh?!

79
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:07,233
[FRENDA]
Give me that mackerel!

80
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:08,442
[EMPLOYEE B]
Ladies!

81
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:29,442
So, um...

82
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:31,317
How long are you
gonna follow me for?

83
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,525
That depends.

84
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:33,900
How much longer are you
going to try to keep

85
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:35,608
that mackerel away from me?

86
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:36,858
[SATEN]
Huh?

87
00:05:36,942 --> 00:05:39,483
Just to be clear,
I'll pay you for it!

88
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:43,608
I'll buy them for ten times
the regular price.

89
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:46,650
All I have is plastic.

90
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:48,525
[FRENDA]
Okay then. Forget money!

91
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:50,067
How about you trade me
for this shockingly

92
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,608
adorable doll?

93
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:54,358
[SATEN] I personally find
that kind of creepy.

94
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:55,525
[FRENDA]
Okay.

95
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:56,983
Then how about this
"Dangerous Cracker"

96
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:59,233
that you can shoot at your
enemies to blow off steam?

97
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,692
[SATEN]
A party popper?

98
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:02,608
My walls are thin, so...

99
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:03,942
Come on!

100
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:05,650
What do I have to offer
to convince you to trade?

101
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,692
[SATEN]
I never said there was anything.

102
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:11,108
Do you really like
mackerel that much?

103
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:13,358
[FRENDA]
"Like" doesn't even come close.

104
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:15,150
If I go too long
without eating it,

105
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:17,775
I get awful palpitations,
my extremities shake,

106
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:19,275
and I hallucinate.

107
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:21,192
[SATEN] If that's true, maybe
you should stop eating it.

108
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:22,483
For your health.

109
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:23,900
You know, I've been eating
it every single day,

110
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,442
supporting the canned
mackerel industry,

111
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:27,400
but then one TV feature
comes along and everyone

112
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:29,817
and their mother rushes
out to buy it all up!

113
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,525
Do you understand
how unfair that is?

114
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:33,067
You owe me that fish!

115
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,442
[SATEN]
Huh?! That's absurd!

116
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:36,775
[SATEN groans]

117
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:38,650
All right already.

118
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:41,150
I really don't want you
hounding me anymore.

119
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:43,900
I guess you can have one
of the two cans I bought.

120
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:45,150
Really?

121
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:46,400
You know, I pegged you
for a gullible sucker

122
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:47,817
the second I saw you,

123
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,317
so I knew if I kept pushing you,
you'd cave eventually!

124
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,108
And it looks like I was right
on the money!

125
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,233
[FRENDA]
Okay, let's get to it!

126
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:56,567
You're gonna eat it here?

127
00:06:58,733 --> 00:06:59,608
[FRENDA yells]

128
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:01,108
What the--? What happened?

129
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:03,608
[FRENDA] I used the one
with too much firepower!

130
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:13,025
[FRENDA]
Hey, wait!

131
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:16,483
That was, all told,
just an unfortunate accident!

132
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:19,942
[SATEN] Sorry, I need what's
left for my own cooking.

133
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:22,067
Plus, I have no patience,
let alone pity,

134
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,733
for people who waste food.

135
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:24,817
[FRENDA]
Huh?

136
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:29,775
The people of this country
are much cold-hearted.

137
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:32,608
I just wanted taste of my
homeland to ease homesickness.

138
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:34,442
It has been so long time.

139
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,525
[whines] I'm so sad.

140
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:39,983
You know, it's rude to
ignore a crying lady!

141
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:41,317
Oh, all right!

142
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,025
You can come over to my
place for dinner tonight.

143
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:44,525
Is that enough for you?

144
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:45,775
Okay! Okay!

145
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:47,983
Japan people is so nice!
Such kind!

146
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,025
[SATEN] What country are
you supposed to be from?

147
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:55,983
C-Curry?

148
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:57,817
What do you think you're doing,
putting the treasure that is

149
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,983
mackerel into curry?

150
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:00,608
Curry is way too
strong a flavor!

151
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:02,108
All the other ingredients
get completely

152
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:03,358
overpowered by it!

153
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,817
You're basically
murdering all the flavor

154
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,150
the mackerel would've had!

155
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:08,067
There's no way this
could taste any good!

156
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,483
So good!

157
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:13,900
The spiciness pairs nicely with
the rich taste of mackerel.

158
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:15,525
Rather than competing,
they synergize

159
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:16,900
and enhance one another!

160
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:19,483
The flavors are dancing
deliciously atop my tongue!

161
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,983
I'd appreciate it if you

Mmm! Deilig!

00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:26,233
[SATEN]
"Die lee"?

165
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:27,567
It means "delicious."

166
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,733
Oh, okay, it's another language.

167
00:08:30,817 --> 00:08:33,942
Well, anyhow,
I'm glad that you like it.

168
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:35,483
I'll take seconds!

169
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:38,442
[SATEN]
At least she's honest.

170

[FRENDA]
Man.

00:08:39,858 --> 00:08:42,233
You're a better cook
than I gave you credit for.

172
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:44,275
Next time we meet,
it'll be my turn to treat you

173
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,525
to a yummy meal.

174
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,733
Mackerel in miso,
or soy sauce or something!

175
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:49,567
[SATEN]
Always with the mackerel.

176
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,108
[FRENDA]
Oh, that reminds me.

177
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:52,567
Are you on FUKIDASHI?

178
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,067
[SATEN]
You mean the messaging app?

179
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,192
Yeah, I use it with
some of my friends.

180
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:59,400
Great, here's my ID.
Let's add each other.

181
00:08:59,483 --> 00:09:00,900
[SATEN]
Uh, sure.

182
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:04,150
[FRENDA]
I'll get out of your hair.

183
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:06,692
Well, "Ha det bra!"

184
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:08,400
"Haday..." Okay.

185
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:09,858
You're gonna have to translate.

186
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:11,317
It means see ya later.

187
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,692
[giggles]

188
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:13,983
Bye!

189
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,567
[door closes]

190
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,692
That girl plays by no one's
rules but her own.

191
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:21,942
Well, it's fine.

192
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,233
I definitely had
some fun, at least.

193
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,567
[SATEN]
Really?

194
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,150
Then I guess it was
a good thing I told you

195
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:32,525
about that app, wasn't it?

196
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:34,192
If you were already able
to prevent an accident

197
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:36,025
from happening, that's great.

198
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,692
Yeah. I can't tell you
all the details,

199
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:38,983
but just take my word for it,

200
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:40,567
knowing about that
app has helped.

201
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,942
"Helped" is an understatement.
You're kicking butt!

202
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:45,525
Oh, Shirai took care of it.
I was mostly just support.

203
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:46,567
But either way,

204
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,692
thanks for telling me
about the app.

205
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:50,067
Hey. It's fine.

206
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,817
As for thanking me,
you already did,

207
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,233
with those adorable little pugs.

208

Wait, I don't remember you
flipping my skirt yet today!

210
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,692
When did you see?

211
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:00,900
Ho-ho.

212
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:03,025
You still have much
left to learn, Kazari.

213
00:10:03,108 --> 00:10:04,317
[UIHARU]
Oh, whatever.

214
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,525
I'll see you later!

215
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:07,192
[SATEN] Good luck with
your Judgment work!

[SATEN]
That girl from yesterday.

219
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:28,983
And before I knew it,
we became friends.

220
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:05,233
[FRENDA] She's so weird, what's
the point in learning that?

221
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:11,858
Hello there!

222
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:14,275
Have you had any good
cards come in lately?

223
00:11:14,358 --> 00:11:17,067
[TRADER A] One that you
would like? Let's see.

224
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,233
There's this one
from a clacker champion.

225
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:22,025
This one from a
coin-stacking record holder,

226
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:23,525
and then this!

227
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:26,608
It's from an incredibly skillful
chopstick handler.

228
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:29,317
Whoa. Chopstick handling, huh?

229
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,567
[YOBOU]
Indian Poker?

230
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,775
[HEART MEASURE]
Yeah.

231
00:11:39,858 --> 00:11:41,233
You can learn just about
anything with them.

232
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:43,150
One's skill or experience
can be passed on

233
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:44,317
to another.

234
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,317
[YOBOU]
So, what made you bring that up?

235
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,858
[HEART MEASURE] There's been
a trend in Academy City lately.

236
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,858
Scientists are starting
to use it.

237
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:53,483
They've begun recording
their findings

238
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,442
within their dreams
and leaving behind cards

239
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:57,567
as a form of insurance.

240
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,067
[YOBOU]
Oh, yeah?

241
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,067
[HEART MEASURE] Of course,
the cards aren't guaranteed

242
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,817
to capture the data they
want to leave behind.

243
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,858
But rumor has it, there
are quite a few of them

244
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:08,567
who are attempting
it regardless.

245
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,442
I guess there must be
a fundamental part

246
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:13,317
of a scientist's mind
that can't be codified.

247
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,275
That makes sense, and I see
where you're going

248
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:16,608
with this.

249
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:17,983
[HEART MEASURE]
Yes.

250
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:19,942
I'm talking about none other
than the nanoparticle

251

object interference
adsorption manipulator,

252
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:25,233
better known as the tweezers.

253
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:26,900
Apparently, knowledge
of it has been leaked

254
00:12:26,983 --> 00:12:28,900
in the form of a card.

255
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:31,817
And is your information
about this reliable at all?

256
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,108
[HEART MEASURE]
Who knows?

257
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:34,775
But if there's even
the slightest possibility,

258
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:36,442
we have to investigate.

259
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:39,483
I'll leave the method
up to you, so get on it.

260
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:40,817
[YOBOU sighs]

Thirteen items returned.

As many as 13?

Most of them seem to be
just idle conversation,

268

but even if there's only
a one-in-a-thousand,

without breaking a sweat.

Okay.

326
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,108
There's a wind speed of two,

327
00:15:47,192 --> 00:15:48,525
and they're at a range
of roughly 80.

So why don't I aim for
something besides the car?

[HAMAZURA whimpers]

00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:01,900
What was that? What happened?

I dunno, but the road's
blocked now!

Yes! Bullseye!

Did you see that? Easy stuff!

Okay Hamazura, you can go now.

How'd I end up like this?

Is this real? Am I dreaming?

Couldn't be.

So, how's your work

Can't get the prototype

My presentation'll be nothing
but the promo video.

You did that last time.
Is everything okay?

No surprise,

Cracking it is
gonna be difficult.

Ignoring the alarms and brute
forcing my way through

355

would be easier, but I'd
rather not leave behind

any trace that I'm after
the tweezers if I can help it.

Nothing's been written

probability of being
related to the tweezers.

If someone's attacking

[STUDENT B] All right,
some other time, then.

412
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,233
[RAKKO] Judging by the
state of the battlefield,

413
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,817
there are two targets.

414
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,733
One of them was
the captured girl,

415
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:58,692
which means the other
was the attacker.

416
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:00,525
Loafers and high heels.

417
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:02,275
They're both female.

418
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:05,733
They're 150 and 153
centimeters tall.

419
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:10,025
Also, considering the
communication log and debris,

420
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,108
the weapons they used were bombs
disguised as creepy dolls.

421

It's been a year and a half
since my classmates

I was this close to
escaping isolation,

424
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:29,067
and I would've become the
most popular girl in class!

425
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,900
Eventually, I'd have become
the school's idol!

426
00:20:31,983 --> 00:20:35,817
My promising future was
destroyed just for this.

they might've been after you?

No! I got nothing going
on worth all that!

But either way, shouldn't
we contact Antiskill?

Aww.

00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,358
So anyway...

448
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,733
I did kinda save your life,

449
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:20,067
so if you wanted to thank me
somehow, I'd understand.

Uh... Okay.

why don't we head on over
to the supermarket

and buy us a whole bunch
of canned mackerel!

00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:28,608
It's always mackerel with you.

[RAKKO] That little blonde
girl still has it on her.

The scent of blood
from the capture team.

457
00:21:43,692 --> 00:21:46,817
It's like a guide, leading
me straight to my prey.

458
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:49,650
Would you look at that?

459
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:51,733
I had to turn down a fun day
with my school friends

460
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:54,733
because of you, and you're
out here living it up!

461
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:56,317
How ironic.

462
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,567
That really pisses me off.

463
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,817
My orders are to capture the
black-haired one alive, but...

464
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,567
I'm free to hunt
the other one, right?

465
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:10,483
I wonder what I should
have you make for me.

466
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:12,900
Curry is, all told,
the obvious choice.

467
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:15,358
But as far as other dishes
that are good with mackerel,

468
00:22:15,442 --> 00:22:16,733
we've got options.

ten-second cooking!

471
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:02,192
Empty the can into
a pot, water and all.

472
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:03,692
Add grated ginger
and whatever else.

473

Add a reasonable
amount of water.

Bring to a boil.

475
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,233
Dissolve in a good
amount of roux.

together, this is delicious!
