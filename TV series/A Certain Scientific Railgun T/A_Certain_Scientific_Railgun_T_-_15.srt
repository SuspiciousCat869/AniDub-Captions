00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,567
[KOZAKU] If you want to make
your way in Academy City,

2
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,192
the most effective
method is to suck up

3
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:28,858
to the researchers here.

4
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,858
It looks like your
rating has gone up

5
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:32,942
since last time.

6
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:34,817
Wow, are you serious?
That's awesome!

7
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,025
I'm so glad.

8
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:38,192
I couldn't have done
it without all of you!

9
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:40,483
"Effort pays off" is a lie.

10
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:42,150
Just like going to a
good school will get you

11
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:43,692
a good job.

12
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:45,358
The research facility
you're with makes

13
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:47,983
or breaks your future.

14
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,900
Thank you very much!

15
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:52,067
I had gotten really good
at putting on a fake smile

16
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,817
to make people like me.

17
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:58,692
I'm looking forward to working
with you again tomorrow!

18
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:04,233
All this acting friendly
is more exhausting

19
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,108
than the experiments.

20
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:07,442
However...

21
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:09,525
I wasn't counting on having
that girl forced on me

22
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:10,733
as a result."

23
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:12,108
[RESEARCHER B]
Oh, Kozaku?

24
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,067
[KOZAKU]
Huh? Y-Yeah?

25
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,442
Hey. Do you think you could
do something for me?

26
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:18,525
This girl could use a playmate
when you have the time.

27
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:25,608
Dolly has lived her whole
life at the facility.

28
00:03:25,692 --> 00:03:27,150
We think her stress
levels are affecting

29
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:29,150
her observational data.

30
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:31,108
So I figured if she had
someone to play with,

31
00:03:31,192 --> 00:03:34,525
it should help alleviate
that stress, right?

32
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:36,608
Sure. If you think
I can be of help.

33
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,900
[laughs]

34

[KOZAKU]
U-Um...

36
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:49,067
[chuckles]

37
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,442
Are you all right?

38
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:52,483
Hey, what's your name?

39
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,275
Mitori Kozaku.

40
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:56,775
Okay, then I'll call
you "Mi" for short!

41
00:03:56,858 --> 00:03:58,192
[KOZAKU]
She's simple.

42
00:03:58,275 --> 00:03:59,358
[DOLLY laughs]

43
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,192
[KOZAKU] From then on, once my
experiments were over...

44
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:16,067
That felt like it took forever.

45
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:32,400
[KOZAKU]
Dolly?

46
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:34,900
[KOZAKU] Without fail, I would
end up being hounded like this.

47
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,442
[DOLLY]
Okay, my turn!

48
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:39,525
Here we go!

49
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:44,025
Six!

50
00:04:44,108 --> 00:04:46,317
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

51
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,567
Look at that,
I already have two kids!

52
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,900
I'll take my congrats.

53
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:52,650
So I was wondering, Dolly.

54
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,817
What's with you not
being able to go outside?

55
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,067
They said it's something
about my treatment.

56
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,525
Treatment?

57
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:01,608
At an ability
development facility?

58
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:03,858
[DOLLY] They say it'll
help my little sister.

59
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:05,483
[KOZAKU]
You have a sister?

60
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:07,400
Apparently, but we've never met.

61
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:09,358
They say if the
treatment goes well,

62
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,650
I'll have lots
of little sisters.

63
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:13,108
[KOZAKU]
What does that mean?

64
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:14,317
[DOLLY]
It's your turn, Mi.

65
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,650
[DOLLY laughs]

66
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:25,525
Mi, this is amazing!

67
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:27,400
It's really pretty, too!

68
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:28,692
I dunno.

69
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:30,400
It's not like it's a work
of art or anything.

70
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:32,983
If you want to see what it's
really like, go to the ocean.

71
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,067
[DOLLY]
Ocean?

72
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,400
Oh, yeah, I read about
that in a book!

73
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:37,942
The place with lots of water!

74
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:39,108
[KOZAKU]
At first,

75
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:40,608
I couldn't help but wonder
why I was stuck

76
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:43,692
with this simpleminded girl,
and just dealt with it.

77
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,108
--[KOZAKU] Dolly, you--
--[DOLLY] Mi! [laughs]

78
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:00,983
Easy!

[DOLLY laughing]

80
00:06:05,358 --> 00:06:06,525
So cute!

81
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:08,233
Do we have to hug
over every little thing?

82
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:10,400
At least warn me.

83
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:12,483
And quit smelling me
all the time!

84
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:15,025
[DOLLY]
But I like the smell of people.

85
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,608
And you have such
a warm smell, Mi.

86
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:22,317
[KOZAKU] Meanwhile,
you smell like chemicals.

87
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:26,567
[DOLLY grunts]

88
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,192
Why're you doing that?

89
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:31,233
'Cause you won't listen,
let alone do what I tell you.

90
00:06:31,317 --> 00:06:32,317
Oh, yeah?!

91
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:35,983
[KOZAKU] Somehow,
whenever I was with her,

92
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,442
I didn't have to
force myself to put on

93
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:39,108
a fake smile.

94
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:40,442
It was genuine.

95
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:44,358
[KOZAKU]
Thanks for everything!

96
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,983
I'm glad we finished early.

00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:48,692
I wonder what we
should play today!

No!

[RESEARCHER A]
Kozaku, come with me please.

103
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:11,233
I imagine by now
someone has told you

104
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:12,692
she's here to be treated.

105
00:07:12,775 --> 00:07:14,775
In the simplest terms possible,
she requires

106
00:07:14,858 --> 00:07:16,192
some life support
equipment in order

107
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:18,192
to stay alive.

108
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:19,775
Now why don't you head on home?

109
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:24,400
[KOZAKU]
Life support equipment? Really?

110
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:42,567
If anyone finds out,
they'll be more than just angry.

"Planned Exterior
construction site." No.

113
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:55,317
If you want to make your
way in Academy City,

114
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,192
the most effective
method is to suck up

115
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:58,858
to the researchers here.

116
00:07:58,942 --> 00:08:01,108
Messing with their work
is out of the question.

117
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,150
Please, stop medicating Dolly!

118
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:09,025
Ah.

119
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:10,900
There was a break-in
reported at the data center,

120
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:12,317
and I was wondering
who could've been

121
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,650
sneaking around. I see.

122
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:16,025
Well.

123
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:17,942
Then it's safe to assume
you know what she really is.

124
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:20,817
I know that she's a clo--

125
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,108
A clone.

126
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:23,525
And that you're using her
as a guinea pig

127
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,817
so you can make
mass-produced clones,

128
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,692
and you want them
to all live longer.

But you're giving her
all kinds of drugs!

You don't care about her health;

you just want to collect
your stupid data!

132
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:36,817
Her lifespan is already short.

133
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,108
And recklessly giving
her those meds

134
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:39,775
is making it even shorter!

[CHIEF RESEARCHER A sighs]

136
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:44,483
She may be a clone.

And what if I told you we can't?

confinement for months.

164
00:09:57,942 --> 00:10:00,733
No. It might have been
even longer than that.

165
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,275
Suddenly one day,
the guard disappeared.

166
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:16,483
And when I went outside,

167
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:19,317
the research facility
was completely deserted.

168
00:10:36,608 --> 00:10:40,983
Go ahead, look down
on us from up there.

169
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:43,733
But know that someday soon

170
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:45,650
I'll show you that even
lab rats have fangs

171
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:47,900
that can make you bleed.

172
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:51,233
But even after that moment,
no matter how hard I tried,

173
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,983
I was still powerless.

174
00:10:57,775 --> 00:11:01,317
I failed my meticulously
planned assassination.

175
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,192
But I did learn something.

176
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:05,858
Even if there were 10,000 of me,

177
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:07,525
I could never lay
so much as a finger

178
00:11:07,608 --> 00:11:09,108
on the governing board.

179
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:13,233
Do me a favor and remove
the mask, will you?

180
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,275
[KOZAKU]
Where am I?

181
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:23,233
[KOZAKU]
And who's this old geezer?

182
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:24,525
My, my.

183
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:26,692
You have a keen
look in your eyes.

184
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:28,108
They're smoldering.

185
00:11:28,192 --> 00:11:30,942
Like a glowing ember that
spews the smoke of hatred.

186
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,525
[GENSEI]
Oh!

187
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:36,192
I supposed I should just
get down to business.

188
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:38,233
If I told you there was
a way to blow Academy City

189
00:11:38,317 --> 00:11:41,358
off the face of the planet,
would you be interested?

190
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:42,775
What'd you say?

191
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:45,733
Huh.

192
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:48,775
Honestly, it sounds
way too good to be true.

193
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:51,150
But why are you telling me?

194
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:52,192
[GENSEI]
Hmm.

195
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:54,358
Dogma, perhaps?

196
00:11:54,442 --> 00:11:56,442
When a person's capacity
to tolerate stress

197
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:57,775
is exceeded,

198
00:11:57,858 --> 00:12:00,567
both lofty ideals and
greedy ambitions crumble,

199
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,400
destroying all motivation.

200
00:12:02,483 --> 00:12:03,983
And for that reason,

201
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:05,525
whether it's by
nature or nurture,

202
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:07,858
I simply can't put
my trust in the concept

203
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:09,400
of "resolve."

204
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:11,817
After all, if it doesn't kick
in when it's crunch time,

205
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,483
what use is it?

206
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,775
However, I find
tremendous hatred's

207
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:18,525
unwillingness to waver
profoundly beautiful.

208
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:20,067
People don't think
twice about giving

209
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,567
their life for the sake
of vengeance.

210
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,108
To answer your question,

211
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:27,567
I'm banking on
the dogma of hatred.

212
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:36,900
[KOZAKU]
That Judgment girl isn't here.

213
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,358
Handcuffs?

214
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:43,525
I can get out of these
with my ability, no sweat.

215
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:48,650
But why bother?

216
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:52,275
If I'm still alive, then it
means that the plan

217
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:53,567
must have failed.

218
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,817
Guess I could just stay here.
and be food for the rats.

219
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:09,400
[KOZAKU]
Misaki Shokuho?

220
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:18,275
[SHOKUHO] I decided to take
a quick peek inside Gensei's

221
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:19,942
memories just in case.

222
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:22,983
And sure enough,
they took me right to you.

223
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,358
You were "Mi," weren't you?

224
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:27,567
I've always wanted
to know why I had

225
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:31,150
to play the part of the girl
who abandoned Dolly,

226
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:32,567
but I brushed it off.

227
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,567
maybe I should've looked
into it a long time ago.

228
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,233
I'll have you turn yourself in,

229
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,733
because it wouldn't be
fair to Shirai if I didn't.

230
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:41,733
But first, I need you
to come with me for a bit.

231
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:43,567
Understand?

232
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,317
You see, I learned
something else when I read

233
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,525
Gensei's memories.

234
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:48,775
[SHOKUHO]
As it turns out,

235
00:13:48,858 --> 00:13:50,442
Dolly had a sister
that was created

236
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:53,233
around the same time as her.

237
00:13:53,317 --> 00:13:55,483
They wanted to perfect
their cloning technology,

238
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:58,650
but that wasn't the only
reason they created Dolly.

239
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:00,067
They were trying
to use her to establish

240
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,608
a network, too.

241
00:14:01,692 --> 00:14:03,358
One that could transfer
data and information

242
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,192
between the clones.

243
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:07,150
All of Dolly's memories
and experiences

244
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:09,567
were transferred into
another individual

245
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,900
and are still there now.

246
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:13,650
That's her "little sister."

247
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:17,358
And she's asleep in
a research facility.

248
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:19,983
While she shares her
memories and experiences,

249
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,692
make no mistake,
she's not Dolly.

250
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:26,233
Still, we can't just
leave her there, right?

251
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:30,317
You can never have enough backup
when on a mission like this.

252
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,233
--So come with me.
--[KOZAKU] Why?

253
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,025
You didn't have to
explain all that to me.

254
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:40,608
You could have just used
your ability to control me.

255
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:42,358
You're not wrong.

256
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:44,067
Are you saying I should?

257
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,817
[KOZAKU]
No. I'll come.

258
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:51,233
[SATEN]
All right.

259
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:53,608
A toast to our dear friend
Shirai's complete recovery!

260
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:54,775
[GROUP]
Cheers!

261
00:14:56,817 --> 00:14:59,025
[KUROKO] Oh, please,
you're making too much of it.

262
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:00,650
Not to mention,
it's a little late.

263
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,067
It's been a whole
week since I got out

264
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,567
of the hospital.

265
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,650
Yeah, we know, but with the
Daihasei Festival going on,

266
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:08,358
we never got the opportunity
to properly celebrate.

267
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:10,150
And if you really need
another reason to party,

268
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:11,317
today's the day you
stopped needing

269
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,275
your wheelchair, right?
Now eat.

270
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,692
I suppose I'll set
my hesitations aside.

271
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:19,358
Whatever the occasion,
I'm happy to eat

272
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:21,067
anything you prepare, Sissy.

273
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:23,442
Mmm!

274
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:24,900
Okay, but why are
we doing this here

275
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:26,317
of all places?

276
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,692
Come on, it's not
like anything else

277
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:28,983
is going on.

278
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:30,942
Oh! Let me just refill
your drink real quick.

279
00:15:31,025 --> 00:15:32,358
One sec, Konori!

280
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:33,858
Guess it's okay this once.

281
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:35,567
Thank you for being so generous!

282
00:15:37,358 --> 00:15:40,067
Come to think of it, Misaka,
how is your mother holding up

283
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,775
since the incident
the other day?

284
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,233
Huh? Mama?

285
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,692
Oh, uh...

286
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:46,567
Good, I think,
all things considered.

287
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,608
Is that right?

288
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:48,692
I'm glad to hear it.

289
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:49,983
I think we all are.

290
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:51,858
But Uiharu was
especially concerned.

291
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:54,275
Hostage situations
can be very traumatic.

292
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:57,608
[MIKOTO] Wait, so that
incident wasn't completely

293
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,525
wiped from their memories?

294
00:15:59,608 --> 00:16:01,817
Then, how do they
remember me acting?

295
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,275
I should probably know.

296
00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:06,358
I'm sure Shokuho must
have made some revisions.

297
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:07,817
Of course she was concerned.

298
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,192
I mean, she got caught up
in all the chaos herself.

299
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:11,900
The bad guy knocked
you out, right?

300
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:13,025
That's a big deal.

301
00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:14,233
[UIHARU]
Uh-huh.

302
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:15,817
Believe me, I haven't
forgotten how little

303
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,067
I did to help.

304
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,858
But luckily Shirai came
along and ended things

305
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:21,567
without much trouble,
so don't worry about it.

306
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,275
I just wish you
had contacted me.

307
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,442
I could have provided
some support, too.

308
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:26,858
That would've been helpful.

309
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,442
I can't believe I didn't
reach out to you.

310
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:30,067
That's not like me.

311
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,733
I'm terribly sorry
for that, Konori.

312
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,233
[MIKOTO] It sounds like
she just erased the fact

313
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:36,108
that I was there at all.

314
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:38,567
Which, I guess makes sense,
considering she said I was stuck

315
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,442
in the bathroom with
an upset stomach.

316
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:43,358
Unless you're ready to
kill me right here and now.

317
00:16:43,442 --> 00:16:44,525
[SATEN]
Welp.

318
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:45,817
That's okay, why don't
we use this party

319
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,317
as a way to wipe
the slate clean?

320
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,483
Whaddya say?

321
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:50,233
I say that's a poorly
disguised attempt

322
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:52,358
to avoid responsibility
for your Shadow Metal

323
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:54,358
exploits, Saten.

324
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:56,400
You sure caused a lot
of trouble, huh?

325
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:58,192
[KONORI]
What are you talking about?

326
00:16:58,275 --> 00:16:59,275
One day, Saten just started--

327
00:16:59,358 --> 00:17:01,108
[SATEN]
Here, Uiharu! Ahh!

328
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:03,400
'Scuse me!

329
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:06,275
I'll have you know Sissy
made that especially for me!

330
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,983
Is something the matter, Sissy?

331
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:10,358
Not at all.

332
00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:12,317
I was just thinking how
nice it is to have friends.

333
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:15,150
[UIHARU]
Are you sure? Okay.

334
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:18,025
[MIKOTO]
I'm really glad I'm here.

335
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:20,608
Being outside of their
circle was tough.

336
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:21,983
This just feels right.

337
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,608
By the way, you can have this.

338
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:29,233
You need some
sort of liquid metal

339
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:31,442
to make your ability
work, don't you?

340
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,733
[SHOKUHO]
That's what she wanted to see.

341
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:57,150
So basically,
Dolly would be with you,

342
00:17:57,233 --> 00:17:59,192
but she would see
and hear me instead?

343
00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:00,400
Yeah.

344
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:01,733
At the time, I hadn't
developed the power

345
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:03,483
to alter people's memories yet.

346
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:05,067
But to tell you the truth,
I'm fairly certain

347
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,567
she figured out that
I wasn't really you

348
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,692
at some point.

349
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:08,858
I see.

350
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:11,025
She had some surprisingly
keen instincts.

351
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:17,358
Thanks.

352
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:18,817
If everything you
told me is true,

353
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,858
then Dolly wasn't
alone at the end,

354
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,108
thanks to you.

355
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:24,775
And that was really
my biggest regret.

356
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:45,817
[KOZAKU]
Dolly.

357
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,525
[DOLLY'S SISTER]
Mi.

358
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:00,942
Is that you?

359
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:04,983
It is, right, Mi?

360
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:20,775
[DOLLY'S SISTER]
We've missed you.

361
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:23,317
We were afraid you didn't
like us anymore.

362
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,067
That you thought we
were disgusting. And--

363
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,775
Dummy.

364
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:29,900
None of that's true at all.

365
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:32,983
We remember this smell.

366
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,983
It's been so long.

367
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:36,233
We love it.

368
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,525
Wait!

369
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:44,650
You're Misaki, aren't you?

370
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:45,817
[SHOKUHO]
Hm?

371
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,817
I have no idea who
you're talking about.

372
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,608
We know it's you, Misaki.

373
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:55,317
Because in our dreams,
we were always with both of you.

374
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,983
The times we spent with you two
are the only memories we have.

375
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:06,817
[SHOKUHO]
I'm sorry!

376
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,692
I'm sorry for tricking
you for so long!

377
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,192
I'm sorry I didn't catch
on to their lies!

378
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:14,192
I'm sorry for butting
into your memories,

379
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:16,817
and without asking you.

380
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,775
And I'm sorry for taking
the easy way out

381
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:21,400
and just believing that lie.

382
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:22,817
If only I'd bothered
to look into

383
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,733
who "Mi" was back then.

384
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:27,150
I could have reunited
her with Dolly.

385
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:28,608
I'd have learned
what the experiment

386
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:30,233
was really about,

387
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:33,525
and I could have saved Dolly
from such an early death.

388
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,567
Everything that happened
to you two is my fault

389
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,567
for forcing my way
into your friendship!

390
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,567
I'll do anything
to make up for it.

391
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,900
Okay, then take us to the ocean.

392
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:51,358
After that, we want
to ride a roller coaster

393
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:54,608
at an amusement park,
and see a hippo at the zoo.

394
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:57,650
Oh, and going on
a plane would be nice.

395
00:20:57,733 --> 00:20:59,983
We want to see
the auroras in Finland,

396
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:02,233
and play with the
dolphins in Hawaii,

397
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:04,067
and the llamas in Machu Pichu.

398
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,108
Hey, you're asking
for way too much.

399
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:07,775
Are you trying
to travel the world?

400
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:10,525
Yeah, actually, you're right.

401
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:13,733
If the three of us are together,
anywhere's fine.

402
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,608
Is that okay?

403
00:21:22,483 --> 00:21:23,608
[SHOKUHO]
Honestly.

404
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:25,108
You always did ignore
whatever was being

405
00:21:25,192 --> 00:21:27,025
said to you,
but made sure we knew

406
00:21:27,108 --> 00:21:28,358
what you wanted.

407
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:30,233
You've got a
real selfish streak.

408
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:33,025
Really.

409
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:35,067
I just don't know
what to do with you.

410
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,317
[MIKOTO]
Good.

411
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,900
It looks like your temperature's
back to normal.

412
00:21:48,983 --> 00:21:50,650
We're officially out
of the woods now.

413
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:52,983
"However, while Misaka
was lying in bed,

414
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:54,567
drifting in and out
of consciousness,

415
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,317
the Daihasei Festival
concluded," says Misaka,

416
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,983
lamenting her
unfortunate circumstances.

417
00:22:00,858 --> 00:22:02,192
Oh, don't pout.

418
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:04,942
I'll take you out somewhere
to make up for it, okay?

419
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:06,025
Where do you wanna go?

420
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:07,900
Ocean.

421
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:08,983
The ocean?

422
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:11,608
We're so not in beach
season anymore.

423
00:22:11,692 --> 00:22:13,692
"For some reason,
unknown to her,

424
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:15,817
Misaka suddenly feels
the desire to make

425
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,733
an exciting promise
with someone dear to her,"

426
00:22:19,817 --> 00:22:23,900
says Misaka, having a
strange sense of déjà vu,

427
00:22:23,983 --> 00:22:25,483
and feeling sentimental.

428
00:23:59,025 --> 00:24:00,483
[SATEN] Hey, if you could have
any dream you wanted,

429
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:02,400
what kind of dream
would it be, Uiharu?

430
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:03,567
[UIHARU]
Hmm.

431
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,067
I'd dream of eating lots
of delicious food

432
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,275
whenever I want!

433
00:24:06,358 --> 00:24:07,692
[SATEN] You do that
all the time already.

434
00:24:07,775 --> 00:24:08,733
You, Shirai?

435
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:09,942
[KUROKO]
I would of course dream of--

436
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:11,150
[SATEN] Ah, on second
thought, never mind!
