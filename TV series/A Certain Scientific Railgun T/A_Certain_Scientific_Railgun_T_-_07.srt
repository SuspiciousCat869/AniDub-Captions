I know you can hear me.

I avoided the

Make no mistake.

If I ever see one
of these again,

00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:53,567
or if they go near my friends,

or if you so much as
look in their direction...

He ran away.

11

Well, Shokuho would
probably erase any memories

linked to her anyway,
so it wouldn't matter.

Not much info in the

They're careful,
I'll give them that.

tell as soon as I saw

that giant robot bug,

00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:41,942
but this isn't the
work of amateurs.

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,108
A vehicle this big
would have no choice

19
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:47,317
but to take the main roads,

20
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,150
so there are only so many
routes it could've followed.

If I check the area's
security camera footage,

00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:55,942
I can trace where it
came from and find her.

So much for the easy way out.

And we can't really have this
many people skip out on it.

00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,567
Just perfect.

Not since last night.

So... Who's this "queen?"

Oh, they mean Misaki Shokuho.

She goes to our school.

39
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:02,900
The girls in her clique pretty
much always refer to her

as their "queen,"
if you can believe it.

Yeah?

Queen, huh?

If I'm remembering right,
Shokuho is that girl

Well, not exactly.

All I can really do
with furry friends

is read their "qualia,"
or sensory experiences.

let me pick up on info

00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,150
so I think she'll be okay.

162
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:43,608
That's awful though.

163
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:45,817
Kongo has gone through
quite the ordeal today,

164
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,192
hasn't she?

165
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:48,942
Misaka seemed really
angry about everything

166
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:50,192
that happened.

167
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:52,525
I think she might
feel responsible.

168
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:54,858
[KUROKO]
Once again with Mikoto Misaka.

169
00:08:54,942 --> 00:08:57,192
I believe I have a handle
on the situation.

170
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,483
But the part about
Mikoto Misaka possibly being

171
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:01,983
one of our friends is a bit of
a stretch, don't you think?

172
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:04,608
It's good to be cautious,
but paranoia is different.

173
00:09:04,692 --> 00:09:07,733
[SATEN] Yeah I know,
that's why I said "possibly."

174
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:09,942
There's an esper at
Tokiwadai who can manipulate

175
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:11,400
memories, isn't there?

176
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:14,817
So, what, Misaki Shokuho
tampered with our memories?

177
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,358
Why would she do that?

178
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:18,733
Moreover, if you're really
concerned this happened,

179
00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:22,608
why didn't you
contact Uiharu, too?

180
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:24,483
Because if this gut-feeling
of mine turns out

181
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:27,483
to be correct, we might
want to wait on that.

182
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,608
[KUROKO]
Mm?

183
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:30,025
[SATEN]
Don't worry about it.

184
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:31,317
I have to call her anyway.

185
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,025
So why don't we just
ask Misaka about this?

186
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,275
Well, I suppose you leave
me with no choice.

187
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:38,150
This doesn't seem
to be a situation I,

188
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:40,650
as a member of Judgment,
can ignore.

189
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:41,692
[phone ringing]

190
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:43,442
[MIKOTO]
Who would be calling me now?

191
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:45,400
Saten?

192
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:46,817
Uh, hello?

193
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,483
[SATEN] Oh, um, am I
speaking with Misaka?

194
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,608
This is Ruiko Saten,
remember me?

195
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:52,942
[MIKOTO]
Uh, yeah!

196
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,525
Thanks for filling
me in earlier.

197
00:09:54,608 --> 00:09:56,775
I appreciate you telling
me what happened.

198
00:09:56,858 --> 00:09:58,608
[SATEN]
Yeah, no prob.

199
00:09:58,692 --> 00:10:00,608
Why are you nervous
just talking to her?

200
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:03,192
[SATEN] You're looking for
your little sister, right?

201
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:04,692
Well, we found her cat,

202
00:10:04,775 --> 00:10:08,275
so we had someone who can
do psychometry check it out.

203
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,942
[MIKOTO]
I see. But I'm sorry.

204
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:12,692
You guys went through
all that trouble,

205
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:14,817
and I have no idea
what this man, or girl

206
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,650
who could be Shokuho
were talking about,

207
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:17,983
or even who they are.

208
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:20,192
Yeah.
See, about what they said...

209
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:21,942
They mentioned a name
and it turned out to be

210
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:23,483
one I'm familiar with.

211
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:25,025
Huh? Wait, really?

212
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:26,650
[SATEN] I was hoping I could
ask you more about

213
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,067
our relationship, too.

214
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,858
Is there someplace where
we could meet up?

215
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:33,067
[MIKOTO]
Okay, yeah!

216
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,025
[SATEN]
Where are you right now, then?

217
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:37,983
[MIKOTO] In front of the station
building in District 15,

218
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:39,400
upper deck of the plaza.

219
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:41,567
[SATEN] Cool, we're pretty
close to there.

220
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,400
Okay, why don't you
wait where you are

221
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:45,025
and Shirai will
come pick you up,

222
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:46,858
then we can talk here,
that sound good?

223
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:48,442
Excuse me, but I'm
not a taxi service,

224
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:49,692
thank you very much!

225
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,358
[MIKOTO]
Kuroko is there with you?

226
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,858
[KUROKO] There you are,
shouting my name out

227
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:55,150
to the world again!
Will you please stop?

228
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:57,067
[KOZAKU B]
Misaka?

229
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,817
There's a little
something I was hoping

230
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,567
you might be willing to tell me.

231
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,692
Do you have a minute to chat?

232
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:04,483
I'm pretty busy right now.

233
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,400
I don't have time to be
chatting with strangers,

234
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:08,650
especially sketchy ones.

235
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:11,025
However, if you have something
to do with the people

236
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:13,608
who hurt my friend,
that's a different story.

237
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:15,108
What do you want?

238
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:18,567
[KOZAKU B] Whoa, just like that
and you're in combat mode.

239
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,650
Well, what do you have
to say about this?

240
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:23,942
[MIKOTO]
Uiharu?

241
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:28,150
That's better.

242
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:29,858
Now first off, why don't
you hang up that phone

243
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:31,608
and toss it aside for me?

244
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:38,692
[KOZAKU B]
Good girl.

245
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:40,817
I don't need to introduce
myself, do I?

246
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,567
I mean, you attacked
so many of our villas

247
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,567
and made off with our data.
I really shouldn't have to.

248
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,733
What does that mean?

249
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:49,192
I "attacked your villas"?

250
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,442
When?

251
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:52,817
[KOZAKU B] Oh, please,
you can't play dumb now.

252
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,067
I know that you've
been snooping around.

253
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,650
So you must already know
what I'm about to ask you.

254
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:01,608
Those clones of yours,
the ones known as "Sisters."

255
00:12:01,692 --> 00:12:03,567
Where exactly are they hiding?

256
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,900
You know, I've done a very
thorough investigation

257
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:10,192
into how you interfered
with Project Level 6 Shift.

258
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:12,025
So I know there's no way
you'd be in the dark

259
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,858
about what happened to
your sisters after that.

260
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,692
It's likely they're still
somewhere in Academy City.

261
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:19,525
So where are they being kept?

262
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:20,983
[MIKOTO]
What's going on here?

263
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:22,900
I figured she was working
with Shokuho,

264
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:24,192
but maybe not.

265
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:25,567
[KOZAKU B] Our underground
intelligence network

266
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,942
is searching around the clock,
but for some reason,

267
00:12:28,025 --> 00:12:29,650
whenever we look
into the "Sisters,"

268
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:31,817
our trail goes cold.

269
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,900
There must be some real
seasoned professionals

270
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:35,858
keeping them out of sight.

271
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:38,650
I honestly don't have a
clue who you people are,

272
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:40,317
but what do you think
assaulting my friends

273
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,692
is going to get you?

274
00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:43,108
[KOZAKU B]
Really?

275
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:45,317
You think you're in a position
to be high and mighty?

276
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,067
In my humble opinion,
you're the one who's messed up.

277
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,067
Somehow you manage to
just go about your life

278
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,358
in this city
like everything's fine.

279
00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:55,817
I mean, you know, after all
the horrors you've seen.

280
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,775
The inhuman atrocities
that were carried out

281
00:12:57,858 --> 00:12:59,733
trying to achieve Level 6.

282
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:01,358
The human experimentation
that went on

283
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:02,942
using Child Errors.

284
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:07,233
Using negotiators to swindle
people out of their DNA maps.

285
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:08,817
And it's not like
that stuff was all done

286
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,567
by one organization,
or a single,

287
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,775
highly influential bad guy.

288
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:13,942
If you trace them backward,

289
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:15,817
they all lead
straight to the top.

290
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,733
To Academy City's higher-ups.

291
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:20,233
Considering what
you've been through,

292
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:23,733
you must realize this whole city
is one big proving ground.

293
00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:24,983
No.

294
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:26,233
You aren't like the other
students who live

295
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:28,108
in blissful ignorance.

296
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:29,817
And yet you turn
a blind eye to the truth,

297
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,942
and continue to live
in this repulsive place.

298
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:35,317
I'm impressed that you
could be so apathetic.

299
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,650
And what do you know?

300
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,942
Never mind.

301
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,192
None of that has
anything to do with this.

302
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:49,442
The fact is, you hurt
my friends and frankly,

303
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:52,692
that's all that I care
about right now.

304
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:55,608
I have nothing to tell you.

305
00:13:55,692 --> 00:13:57,983
Now let Uiharu go.

306
00:13:58,067 --> 00:13:59,942
That knife won't move an inch.

307
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:01,692
My shocks will go
through you faster than

308
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:02,983
you can strike.

309
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:04,900
[KOZAKU B]
Called her by name, huh?

310
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:06,567
Then you do know her!

311
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,900
She was acting pretty
chummy with your mother,

312
00:14:08,983 --> 00:14:10,525
so I suspected as much.

313
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:12,858
But it's good to know
my instincts were correct.

314
00:14:12,942 --> 00:14:13,983
What do you mean?

315
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:15,108
My mother?

316
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,733
[MIKOTO]
No... Mama!

317
00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:22,275
There's two of her?

318
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:24,067
[KOZAKU B] Good luck trying to
precision strike two targets

319
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,317
at once.

320
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,192
The lives of these two far
outweigh giving up

321
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:28,942
the location of the clones.

322
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:30,650
I'm sure you agree.

323
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:32,358
So I'll ask you again.

324
00:14:32,442 --> 00:14:33,900
Where are the Sisters?

325
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:38,025
[MIKOTO] And I'll say this
one more time, too.

326
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:40,567
I have nothing to tell you.

327
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,775
[KOZAKU B] Oh, dear, you don't
think I'm bluffing, do you?

328
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:45,400
Or are you just that
willing to abandon

329
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:48,108
your family and friends?

330
00:14:48,192 --> 00:14:52,400
[MIKOTO]
I... I'm going to save Uiharu.

331
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:54,650
Even if it kills me.

332
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:55,692
I swear.

333
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:56,942
[KOZAKU B laughs]

334
00:14:57,025 --> 00:14:58,692
Does that mean you don't
care about your mother?

335
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:00,317
You're awfu--[gasps]

336
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:05,817
[KOZAKU]
Ugh, seriously?

337
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,858
I tried to negotiate,
but that's over.

338
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:10,275
Sorry about this, "Mommy."

339
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:13,317
I can't have her thinking
I'm all bark and no bite!

340
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,650
So if you have to blame someone,

341
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,858
blame your daughter
for letting you die--

342
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:18,858
--[KUROKO grunts]
--[KOZAKU gasps]

343
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:20,400
[KOZAKU]
She had a friend nearby?

344
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:25,817
[KUROKO] Her breathing, pulse,
and temperature are normal.

345
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,108
From what I can see,
she's not injured.

346
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:30,608
Ran off, huh?

347
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:32,358
I would like to go after her,

348
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:35,275
but the safety of
the hostage comes first.

349
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:37,525
Besides, I can ask
her what happened.

350
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:41,442
I think Uiharu is all right.

351
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:42,733
She doesn't look hurt.

352
00:15:44,483 --> 00:15:46,483
--[KUROKO] Please back away!
--[MIKOTO] Huh? Hold on.

353
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:51,483
I'm a member of Judgment.

354
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,525
I'm charging you with
kidnapping and assault.

355
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:55,025
--You're under arrest--
--[MIKOTO] Kuroko!

356
00:15:55,108 --> 00:15:56,233
Get away from her!

357
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:05,817
[MIKOTO]
That girl... isn't human?

358
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:13,025
My bolts have no effect.

359
00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:15,733
Kuroko, teleport these
two someplace safe.

360
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,442
[MIKOTO]
My electricity didn't stop her.

361
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:26,942
Will my railgun even work?

362
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:43,567
[MIKOTO]
She melted?

363
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:48,067
What the...?

364
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,108
That's weird.

365
00:16:49,192 --> 00:16:51,192
Is that some kind
of liquid metal?

366
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:53,067
[MIKOTO] It looked like she
was controlling it remotely,

367
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,358
like a puppet.

368
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:58,483
Makes sense.
But then why did she stop?

369
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:00,025
I'm not sure.

370
00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:02,233
But if this is
that girl's ability,

371
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:04,025
then maybe she
fled out of range.

372
00:17:10,108 --> 00:17:12,567
[KOZAKU] Well, I'm not
supposed to let Mikoto die,

373
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,108
so I did what I could, I guess.

374
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:19,608
I gotta admit, negotiating with
her head-on is not simple.

375
00:17:19,692 --> 00:17:21,567
But she can easily
take care of someone

376
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,483
hiding behind a camera too,
so no choice.

377
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,067
You know what?

378
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,567
I should be glad I got anything
at all out of that encounter.

379
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,858
And what does that mean?

380
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:33,358
I "attacked your villas?" When?

381
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:35,317
[KOZAKU]
I brushed it off at the time,

382
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,275
but she would gain
nothing by denying that.

383
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:41,608
Eyewitness reports had me
convinced that it was Mikoto,

384
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:45,067
but maybe it's possible
that testimony was false.

385
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,775
Meaning...

386
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,233
It's also possible that
the witnesses' memories

387
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:50,483
were altered.

388
00:17:52,108 --> 00:17:55,483
I'd better change how
I approach this. Besides...

389
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:57,525
And what do you know?

390
00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:01,150
There may still be
some hope for her.

391
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:05,108
[KUROKO] Well?
Are you just gonna stand there?

392
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:07,067
Or are you gonna tell me
what that was about?

393
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,942
Huh? Sorry.

394
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:10,567
Believe me when I say
I have no idea

395
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,692
who that was, either--

396
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:13,150
[KUROKO]
I'm bothered by that, as well,

397
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:15,317
but I'm talking about
your actions.

398
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,317
You acted as if you somehow
knew I was going

399
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,233
to be there to back you up.

400
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:21,775
[KUROKO]
You told that girl quite clearly

401
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:25,775
that you intended to save
Uiharu and not your mother.

402
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:26,900
That was meant for me,

403
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:29,483
so I'd know who
to target, right?

404
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:33,275
I mean, after I had
to hang up on you two,

405
00:18:33,358 --> 00:18:35,733
I could sense the E-M
signal of an incoming call

406
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:37,775
to Uiharu's cell,

407
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:39,775
and figured Saten was
calling her to make sure

408
00:18:39,858 --> 00:18:42,358
everything was okay
since I said her name.

409
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:44,817
I had already told you
where I was,

410
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,483
and knowing you,
you could be here

411
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:49,067
in less than ten seconds,
so I assumed you were

412
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,942
hiding somewhere nearby.

413
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:56,317
Thank you for letting me take
care of rescuing your friend.

414
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:00,733
Uiharu is a member of Judgment.

415
00:19:00,817 --> 00:19:03,233
It's only natural to give
priority to a civilian

416
00:19:03,317 --> 00:19:04,942
over a coworker.

417
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:07,317
I should be asking you why
you left your mother's life

418
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,692
in the hands of a stranger.

419
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,567
[MIKOTO]
Mm...

420
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,317
If I had prioritized
Mama over a friend,

421
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,192
she would have been
furious with me.

422
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:17,317
Besides...

423
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,150
I just had faith in you.

424
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:22,442
I knew I could
trust you to save her.

425
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:23,567
So that's why.

426
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,650
Well... All right.

427
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:29,858
That is my job after all,

428
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:32,025
so it makes sense
that you'd think--

429
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:33,192
[MIKOTO]
Are you okay?

430
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:36,192
Sorry.

431
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,150
You're hurt and I
made you exert yourself.

432
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,775
Huh? No, I'm perfectly fine!

433
00:19:42,858 --> 00:19:45,442
I do not require your
unwelcome concern!

434
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:47,483
Will you chill out?

435
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,483
Come on, hold on to me tight.

436
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,400
[KUROKO]
I... I'll be fine on my own!

437
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,608
Let me go.

438
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:57,192
I think you may have
misunderstood me!

439
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,317
[SATEN]
Good news.

440
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,067
It sounds like neither
of them were hurt.

441
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,150
They said they should
both wake up in no time.

442
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:06,900
Thank goodness.

443
00:20:06,983 --> 00:20:08,275
So.

444
00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:10,275
You said you needed to speak
with us about something?

445
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:11,650
Yeah. Uh...

446
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:17,067
So, the person who
kidnapped your sister,

447
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,108
the girl in that
kitten's memory.

448
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:24,025
You think it's safe for us to
assume it's Misaki Shokuho?

449
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:25,442
[MIKOTO]
Yeah.

450
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,525
I can't really think of anyone
else that it could be.

451
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:30,775
[SATEN] Well, that thing we
heard from the psychometry,

452
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:33,358
the auribus-whatever-it-was
Latin?

453
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,025
That's the name of
an urban legend site

454
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,358
that I've been
checking out lately.

455
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:39,233
A website for urban legends?

456
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:40,733
Where are you going with this?

457
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:43,400
What does that have to do
with a girl like Misaki Shokuho?

458
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:45,567
The thing is,
the site doesn't just collect

459
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,358
a bunch of different rumors--

460
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:49,317
it actually goes around
confirming their details

461
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,025
as best they can.

462
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:52,858
And yesterday,
when I was off trying to find

463
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:54,775
some Shadow Metal,

464
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:58,108
Uiharu was looking for
the site to feed me info,

465
00:20:58,192 --> 00:21:01,567
but said she couldn't find it.

466
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,775
So not long ago,

467
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:05,317
I tried searching
for it again, but...

468
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,442
Sure enough, there's a whole
bunch of similar results,

469
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:12,858
but I can't find the original
site no matter how far I scroll.

470
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:14,942
It's impossible to
completely erase any data

471
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:18,067
once it's posted on
the internet. And so...

472
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,983
I was thinking that somebody
could have distributed

473
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:21,775
a bunch of meaningless,
substitute data

474
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:23,858
that would show up in
searches before the site

475
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:26,483
to keep people from reaching it.

476
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:29,483
Okay. That means there's
something on that site

477
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:33,150
that was a problem for someone,
and they wanted it taken down.

478
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:34,358
Right.

479
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:36,733
Knowing Uiharu,
she'd have sensed something

480
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:39,317
out of place and tried
to hunt down the cause.

481
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,983
She also has the skill
to actually find it.

482
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:45,358
But this somebody
probably detected

483
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:48,733
what Uiharu was doing
and attacked her.

484
00:21:48,817 --> 00:21:50,567
Assuming it was Shokuho,

485
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,067
she would have had
Uiharu erase the data.

486
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,067
And then, after
searching her memories,

487
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,692
she'd also have learned
that she's a good friend

488
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,233
of mine.

489
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,317
That would explain
everything that's happened.

490
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,483
I know it sounds like
a crazy conclusion to draw

491
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:06,150
from trying to connect
the dots, but still,

492
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:09,317
if it's true, then we
have the computer.

493
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,150
[MIKOTO] I think it's
worth checking it out.

494
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:17,317
[GROUP gasps]

495
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,108
She restored the erased data!

496
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:21,567
There it is!

497
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,108
[MIKOTO]
Shokuho!

498
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,650
[KUROKO]
The Railgun of Tokiwadai.

499
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:01,650
She's an obnoxious girl
who brags about being

500
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:02,817
a Level 5!

501
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,233
At least, that's what I thought.

502
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,025
But what's with that
smile of hers?

503
00:24:06,108 --> 00:24:07,775
Why does it feel like
my heart is in a vice-grip

504
00:24:07,858 --> 00:24:10,067
whenever I run into this girl?

505
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,567
[UIHARU]
Well, you are rather excitable.
