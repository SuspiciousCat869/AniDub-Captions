1
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:36,692
[KONORI]
Honestly.

2
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:39,858
That's not a simple
favor you're asking for.

3
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:41,733
I know, and I'm sorry, Konori.

4
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:44,900
But with only what I have
here in the hospital,

5
00:00:44,983 --> 00:00:48,858
it's not exactly easy to perform
all of my Judgment duties.

6
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:50,067
[KONORI]
Sheesh.

7
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,067
Your wounds aren't even
completely healed yet.

8
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,150
And wow, they look painful!

9
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:56,608
Hey! Maybe don't use your
clairvoyance ability

10
00:00:56,692 --> 00:00:59,817
in a hospital?
It's a little inappropriate!

11
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,483
[KONORI chuckles]
Still, I'm serious.

12
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:05,692
Don't push yourself too hard.

13
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,692
Uiharu is worried about you.

14
00:01:08,775 --> 00:01:10,108
[KUROKO]
Yeah.

15
00:01:10,192 --> 00:01:12,650
She must feel partially
responsible for me getting hurt.

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,733
Since she led me into the
situation that resulted'

17
00:01:16,817 --> 00:01:18,150
in these injuries.

18
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,483
Probably.

19
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:22,692
[KUROKO] But her blaming herself
is the reason I have to

20
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:25,275
get better as soon as possible.

21
00:01:25,358 --> 00:01:26,650
You know her.

22
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:29,025
She'll feel like she has
to make up for this somehow.

23
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:32,608
That's for sure.

24
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,733
Reminds me of someone I know.

25
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:35,817
What was that?

26
00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:38,275
[KONORI]
Nothing.

27
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:41,900
[F MEMBER A]
Well, we did it!

28
00:01:41,983 --> 00:01:43,150
[M MEMBER A]
Finally.

29
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:45,025
[M MEMBER B]
Thank goodness.

30
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:48,317
[M CHAIRMAN A]
Yes. You've done well, everyone.

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,025
But...

32
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:52,858
Why do I have an awfully
bad feeling about this?

33
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,775
[F REPORTER A] The Daihasei
Festival is about to begin!

34
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:02,525
It's one of the few
times Academy City

35
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:05,025
opens its doors
to the outside world,

36
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:06,775
and parents of
the competing students,

37
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:08,400
as well as many
other spectators,

38
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:11,108
have gathered in the
main stadium to watch.

39
00:02:11,192 --> 00:02:12,567
[KOMOE]
Ms. Watanabe!

40
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:16,483
Long time no see!

41
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:19,317
Another year,
another festival, huh?

42
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,233
Ms. Tsukuyomi.

43
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:23,858
May I ask why you're
dressed like that?

44
00:02:23,942 --> 00:02:25,108
[laughs]

45
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:27,942
Someone has to cheer
on the students!

46
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:29,983
Well, at least you're
supporting the children.

47
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:34,567
[KOMOE]
That's right, I almost forgot.

48
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,608
Shokuho is taking the
athlete's pledge this year,

49
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:38,025
isn't she?

50
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:39,233
[WATANABE]
Yes.

51
00:02:39,317 --> 00:02:41,192
The plan was to have
some Level 5s perform

52
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:44,692
a sort of demonstration
this year.

53
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:46,192
However...

54
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:50,192
[SHOKUHO, SOGIITA]
The athlete's pledge!

55
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:51,067
We will...

56
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,400
We all shall...

57
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:54,483
[SOGIITA] ...adhere to the
ideals of sportsmanship

58
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:56,983
throughout this year's
Daihasei Festival.

59
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:59,483
[SHOKUHO] ...use our youthful
dreams and fervent wills

60
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:00,858
as our strength.

61
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:03,275
And forge undying bonds with...

62
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:05,025
Bonds with, uh...

63
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:07,442
Man, what was it again?

64
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:08,650
Ah, whatever!

65
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:10,150
We're gonna do something
or other with those

66
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:12,775
"undying bonds"
and our overflowing guts!

stand in our way,

[MIKOTO]
What was that?

76
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:41,067
Well, that was basically
a disaster, wasn't it?

77
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,108
Uh-huh.

78
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:44,317
[F ANNOUNCER A]
Um...

79
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,442
This concludes our
opening ceremonies.

80
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:49,733
[SHOKUHO]
He upstaged me.

81
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:23,817
[SATEN]
The Daihasei Festival.

82
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,608
An event spanning seven days
that is held in Academy City

83
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:28,483
every year.

84
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:31,733
It's kind of like a
large-scale field day.

85
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:33,775
Unlike conventional
athletic festivals,

86
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:36,817
the Daihasei Festival has all
of Academy City's students

87
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,900
compete for their schools.

88
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:40,442
Plus,

89
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:43,358
TV stations broadcast what's
happening to the whole world!

90
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:46,067
But the biggest difference...

91
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,233
...is that every single event
has espers competing in them!

92
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,692
And you know what?

93
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:54,192
They say that when espers
compete against each other,

94
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:56,775
the resulting phenomenon
is one you won't ever find

95
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:57,858
anywhere else!

96
00:05:57,942 --> 00:05:58,983
[UIHARU]
Hm?

97
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,775
Do you mean that
urban legend about

98
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:02,608
whatever-it's-called metal?

99
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:03,942
[SATEN]
Come on!

100
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:06,358
Its name is "shadow metal."
It's not that hard.

101
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:08,108
When dozens,
or better yet, hundreds

102
00:06:08,192 --> 00:06:09,733
of esper abilities clash,

103
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:12,358
they say this mysterious
metal that's never been found

104
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:14,900
naturally occurring
on Earth is created!

105
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:16,900
And where else but
the Daihasei Festival

106
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:18,608
could that possibly happen?

107
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,483
Not only that, but it's so
rare that it goes for

108
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:23,442
an astronomical price
if you find the right buyer.

109
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:25,192
So we gotta look for it
while we have--

110
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:27,900
[KUROKO]
Saten!

111
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:34,733
[KUROKO] You still believe
in such ridiculous rumors?!

112
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:36,567
What? Oh, not at all.

113
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,317
I was just messing around.

114
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,692
It's just a rumor!

115
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:43,067
I know not to take it seriously.

116
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,483
[KUROKO] That's what you
said last time, and look

117
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:45,692
what happened!

118
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:47,317
There's nothing wrong
with being curious,

119
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,483
but maybe consider
the consequences!

120
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:50,942
[SATEN]
Whoa!

121
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:53,317

up on that giant monitor!

And in Lane Four, this pair!

124

From Tokiwadai Middle School,
Mikoto Misaka and Mitsuko Kongo!

125
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:05,775
That's the lineup for the
third event of block seven,

126
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,150
the three-legged race!

127
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:09,692
Now it's time to
explain the rules!

128
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:11,525
[KUMOKAWA] If the band around
their ankles comes off,

129
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:13,150
they are disqualified.

130
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,692
Use of their abilities to
directly harm other competitors

131
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:17,108
is prohibited.

132
00:07:17,192 --> 00:07:19,650
Further, as a restriction
on higher-level espers,

133
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:23,025
Misaka is not permitted
to use her electrical abilities.

134
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,025
[RADIO DJ] In other words,
any non-electrical powers

135
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:27,067
are A-OK for this event!

136

[M STARTER A]
On your marks!

137
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:31,067
[RADIO DJ]
So, what do you think?

138
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,233
Is it fair to say that Tokiwadai
is the favorite to win

139
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:34,775
this race?

140
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:36,442
[KUMOKAWA] If they were simply
throwing their abilities around

141
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:38,567
until the others were
knocked out, maybe.

142
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,525
But given that they
must win a race,

143
00:07:40,608 --> 00:07:42,817
depending on the tactics used,
it's anyone's game.

144
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:45,525
[KONGO laughs]

145
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:47,942
As if the other schools
have a chance with their tricks.

146
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:49,525
Do they know who we are?

147
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:51,525
They would do well
to respect Tokiwadai's

of time practicing.

And a lot of time
falling flat on our faces.

to give us a nickname?

00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:27,983
Those bandages are
clinging to everyone!

162
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:30,775
Except to the Airin Girl's
High students, of course!

163
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:31,858
Look at that hustle!

164
00:08:31,942 --> 00:08:33,317
What will happen next?

165
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,692
[KUMOKAWA] According to my
data, she is a telekinetic.

166
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:39,192
She can control anything
she is in contact with.

167
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:41,192
Her partner is an esper
who can reduce anything

168
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:43,108
she touches into raw materials.

169
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:45,692
It appears she broke down
the track's pavement.

170
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,858
That explains it.

171
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:48,817
So the black on
the wrappings is asphalt.

172
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,817
It's sticky and looks like
it's starting to harden.

173
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,858
It's a smart move when
used right out of the gate.

174
00:08:54,942 --> 00:08:56,150
Why's that?

175
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:58,025
With a few notable exceptions,

176
00:08:58,108 --> 00:09:00,442
most abilities have
a limited range.

177
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:03,358
Once these girls have run
outside the range of others,

178
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,275
it becomes a normal
race for them.

179
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:06,733
That makes sense!

180
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:09,442
But wait, the other teams
are starting to break free.

181
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:11,900
Crap, my clothes are
heavy and sticky now!

182
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:13,775
Good luck catching up, losers!

183
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,858
[RADIO DJ]
Oh! And what do we have here?

184
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:23,983
They look like...

185
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:27,317
[AIRIN GIRL B]
Wait, hamsters? But why?

186
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,525
[KUMOKAWA] It's likely that
Ninoude Affiliated Middle School

187
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:32,025
set this up before the race.

188
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:34,317
[KUMOKAWA] Those two are both
rodent-specific telepaths,

189
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,025
if you can believe it.

190
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,275
[RADIO DJ] But are a couple of
hamsters really gonna be enough

191
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:39,858
to stop them?

192
00:09:39,942 --> 00:09:42,817
[KUMOKAWA] I believe the target
is the band around their ankles.

193
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,192
[RADIO DJ]
So that's it!

194
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:45,983
Their plan is to have the
hamsters bite their way

195
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,400
through that and
disqualify them!

196
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:49,983
Not if I can help it!

197
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:50,817
[AIRIN GIRL B]
Huh?!

198
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,608
Where are you going? No!

199
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,942
[KUMOKAWA]
Hmm...

200
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:55,400
I guess they chewed through
their underwear straps

201
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:56,483
by mistake.

202
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:00,150
Hey, come back!

203
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,983
[RADIO DJ] They seem too
embarrassed to move!

204
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:03,608
Good job, hamsters!

205
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:07,358
Approaching the area next are
Habatobi High and Tokiwadai.

206
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:10,567
And here come
the tiny assassins!

207
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,067
[KUMOKAWA]
Yeah, that's about right.

208
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,483
Hey, jerk!

209
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:16,067
What do you think you're
doing to my darling Kotaro?

210
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,400
Shut up!

211
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,692
If you don't like it,
then don't sic 'em on us!

212
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,858
[RADIO DJ]
What's this?

213
00:10:20,942 --> 00:10:23,275
Contestant Misaka
has collapsed as well.

214
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:26,650
[KUMOKAWA] Her E-M field must
be keeping the hamsters at bay,

215
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,942
and she appears to be
in shock because of it.

216
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,275
How tiresome.

217
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:34,358
It seems everyone is
pulling out their tricks

218
00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:36,483
and it's devolved
into utter chaos.

219
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:39,400
If it were me there,
I know exactly what I'd do.

220
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:42,400
I'd control the contestants and
judges with my Mental Out,

221
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:44,525
and then stroll leisurely
to the finish line

222
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:46,275
without breaking a sweat.

223
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:48,567
[KONORI] Well, using it on
people who aren't in the race

224
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,525
is against the rules.

225
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,233
And so are unrelated items.

226
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:57,233
[SHOKUHO]
Huh?

227
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:00,817
[RADIO DJ]
The third event of block seven,

228
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,608
the three-legged race,
is entering the home stretch!

229
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:05,108
Once they round
this last corner,

230
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:07,233
it's a straight shot
to the finish line!

231
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,400
The Habatobi High
team has been bringing

232
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:12,483
its A-game since breaking free,

233
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,483
and is now in the lead
at the final turn!

234
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:21,025
But Tokiwadai and Ninoude
are still right on their tail!

235
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:22,233
[NINOUDE GIRL A]
This isn't over.

236
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:23,858
I know we can get past them!

237
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,942
Yeah? Well you're not
the only ones!

238
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:27,067
[GROUP yells]

239
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,442
[RADIO DJ]
Ahh, what just happened?

240
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:30,733
Both teams have
inexplicably slipped!

241
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:32,775
But Tokiwadai avoids
disaster thanks to

242
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,067
contestant Misaka's magnetism!

243
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,525
[KUMOKAWA] Habatobi High's
contestant Amime has the ability

244
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:39,858
to control the frictional
coefficient of anything

245
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:41,733
he touches.

246
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:43,358
When we were rounding
the corner,

247
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:45,525
I leaned into the turn
and touched the track.

248
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:47,942
It only lasts for a short
time, unfortunately.

249
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:50,317
[RADIO DJ] Tokiwadai uses the
centrifugal force to close

250
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,775
the gap!

251
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:54,358
I had a feeling it wasn't
gonna be that easy!

252
00:11:54,442 --> 00:11:55,400
Ready?

253
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,108
[RADIO DJ] Oh! Contestant Amime
has used his ability

254
00:11:59,192 --> 00:12:01,942
so they can skate
their way to the end!

255
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:04,275
I can collect the moisture
from the air in my hand,

256
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:06,525
break it down, and ignite it!

257
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:09,233
And I think it'll make for
a fine rocket boost here!

258
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:10,733
It's a straight shot
to the goal.

259
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:12,192
We got this in the bag!

260
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,650
[BOTH yell]

261
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:19,733
[RADIO DJ] Uh-oh!
Habatobi High has lost control!

262
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:22,067
They're heading out of bounds!

263
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,858
[AMIME]
Oh, no!

264
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:28,983
[AMIME, TODOROKI grunt]

265
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:30,067
[RADIO DJ]
What's this?

266
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,900
A gym mat has
flown through the air,

267
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:33,858
catching the team
before the crash landing!

268
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:37,817
What team but Tokiwadai
could have performed

269
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,650
such a dramatic rescue?

270
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:41,525
Contestant Misaka
pulled up the safety mat

271
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:44,108
with her magnetism, and
Contestant Kongo launched it

272
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:46,692
toward them with her Aero Hand!

273
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:49,525
One false move and that could
have gone all sorts of wrong!

274
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:52,358
But that combo was
performed flawlessly!

275
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,900
Damn it!

276
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,317
If we hadn't screwed that up,
we would have won!

277
00:12:58,817 --> 00:12:59,733
Hang on.

278
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:01,567
[AMIME]
What?

279
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,150
[TODOROKI]
Iron filings?

280
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:05,317
[MIKOTO] Back from when we were
wrapped up in those bandages,

281
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,858
I used the opportunity to
mix iron into the asphalt

282
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:09,692
before it hardened.

283
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:11,775
I was planning to intervene
if I saw you approaching

284
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,733
the finish line before us.

285
00:13:13,817 --> 00:13:16,025
But you guys kinda
saved me the trouble.

286
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:17,483
Sorry for being so sneaky!

287
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:20,733
She didn't miss a beat.

288
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:22,900
What do they teach them
at that fancy school?

289
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:25,317
[TODOROKI] She basically just
told us no matter what we did,

290
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,317
we were gonna lose.

291
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,483
[RADIO DJ] And finally, the
Tokiwadai team crosses

292
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:33,358
the finish line!

293
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:35,567
[KUMOKAWA] It's not the
most surprising result.

294
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,900
Perhaps the other schools
would have stood

295
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,650
a better chance if they
teamed up on them.

296
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:41,525
Hey! They won!

297
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:43,817
[UIHARU] They make a
pretty good pair, after all.

298
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,358
If it weren't for my injuries.

299
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:46,942
I would be the one
standing next to her,

300
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:49,108
basking in the glory
of our teamwork!

301
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:52,400
[squeals] Mitsuko Kongo!
Get outta the way!

302
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,192
You're blocking
my view of Sissy!

303
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:56,525
[XOCHITL] Damn it. How do I
answer a call on this thing?

304
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:57,817
Is it a new model?

305
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,108
I wish they hadn't given
me this crazy phone.

306
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:02,650
I wouldn't be having this
problem with a regular cell.

307
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,483
[SATEN] If you pull that part
on the side out,

308
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:08,025
you'll be able to
use the screen,

309
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:10,067
and then you can call them
back from your call history.

310
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:13,025
Oh, you're right.

311
00:14:13,108 --> 00:14:14,900
Thanks, that was very helpf--

[yells]

313
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,775
Did I do something wrong?

Uh... No. I just...

315
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:24,317

Hey, Saten, we're leaving!

No. You must be imagining it.

Why didn't you answer before?

Are you in trouble?

327
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:04,942
[XOCHITL] No. I just couldn't
get on the phone quick enough.

328

[DOCTOR] You've safely managed
to get into Academy City, then?

[DOCTOR] This is your first
mission for MEMBER,

331
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:12,608
so you'd better succeed.

[MISAKA SISTER A]
The Daihasei Festival.

339
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:30,900
Misaka does not currently
receive any formal education,

340
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:33,150
so she cannot participate.

Misaka!

00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:42,983
We watched you in
the three-legged race!

345
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,442
Impressive as always.

[MIKOTO chuckles]

00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:48,692
I'm glad we won, but we did get
pretty dirty in the process.

Hey, whatever,
a win's a win, right?

349
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:52,942
And man, I was surprised
by how fast you were!

350
00:15:53,025 --> 00:15:54,775
Those were boys
in the same year as us,

351
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:56,192
but you passed them, no problem!

00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:58,358
[chuckles]
Thanks, I guess.

Ever since I was little,
I've been pretty qui--

[UIHARU, SATEN]
Mama?!

361
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,733
Uh... "Mama" is what I
used to call her as a kid,

362
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:15,317
so it kinda slipped out.

363
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,192
It's not like I do
that all the time.

364
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:19,567
[SATEN] Wait, Mama as in her
mother? I didn't mishear that?

365
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,483
Not her older sister,
but her mother?

366
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:23,442
You look like you're
barely 20 years old!

367
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:24,983
Oh. Yeah, that.

00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,817
[MISUZU] Ah... I take it you
two are Mikoto's friends?

369
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,233
What a kind thing
for you to say.

370
00:16:30,317 --> 00:16:32,275
[SATEN] Ah, but you know,
now that I'm really taking

371
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,775
a good look, I can totally see
parts of Misaka in you.

00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:37,233
Chest excluded.

373
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:38,525
Hey, uh, Saten?

374
00:16:38,608 --> 00:16:40,733
Why don't you and I
have a little chat later?

375
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:42,483
Just the two of us.

376
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:45,275
[SATEN] I'm kidding!
It was just a joke, okay?

377
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:46,692
[MIKOTO]
Sure.

378
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:48,817
Oh. Hey, where's Kuroko?

379
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,067
She was going out on Judgment
patrol last time I heard.

380
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,650
If you need her for something,
I can call her.

381
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:56,650
Thanks, but it's fine.

382
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:58,483
I was just thinking I
could ask her if she would

383
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:00,650
teleport me back to
Tokiwadai so I could change

384
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:03,067
out of this filthy
uniform I'm stuck in.

385
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,567
Right.

386
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,942
I can see why you wouldn't
want to keep that on anymore.

387
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,942
But looking at the time,

388
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:12,358
I don't think I can make it back
before the next race starts.

389
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:14,150
You could always ask
someone to fill in for you

390
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,275
in the meantime.

391
00:17:15,358 --> 00:17:16,442
It wouldn't be long.

392
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:17,817
Yeah, maybe.

393
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,983
That idiot and I have
our showdown though,

394
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,567
so I gotta make sure
I'm there for that.

395
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,442
And who might "that idiot" be?

396
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,650
Mama is curious!

397
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:27,525
Why are you making
such a big deal about it?

398
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:29,025
There's nothing
special about him.

399
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:30,733
He's just some stupid guy.

400
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,525
Who? Tell me!

401
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:34,150
[SATEN] From what I've
gathered, he's someone who

402
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:36,733
Misaka apparently owes a lot to.

403
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:38,442
[MISUZU]
Ooh, tell me more.

404
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:39,817
[UIHARU]
Hey! I just remembered!

405
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,108
I was watching the scavenger
hunt coverage earlier,

406
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:44,900
and I saw Misaka
with a spiky-haired boy.

407
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:46,108
[MISUZU]
Spiky-haired?

408
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:47,650
Oh! That boy!

409
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,108
[SATEN]
Wait, you know who he is?

410
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:50,900
[MISUZU] Yeah, I happened
to see them this morning.

411
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:53,442
Misaka was with what looked
like a high-school aged boy,

412
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:54,608
and said that if he beat her,

413
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:56,650
she'd do anything
he said, or something.

414
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:57,775
[MIKOTO]
Come on!

415
00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:01,275
There are three of them
against me now?

[M STUDENTS yelling]

417
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:10,775
[AWATSUKI] Wow. They're
being incredibly forceful.

418
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:12,275
It's almost kind of gruesome.

419
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,150

420
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,233
[AWATSUKI]
Yes?

421
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:24,108
Have you ever been
in a fight before?

422
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:25,150
A fight?

423
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,650
[WANNAI] I mean, besides
that time against STUDY.

424
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,942
We've been taught all this time
that the enemy is within us,

425
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:34,942
that we're training not
to be better than others,

426
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:37,483
but to overcome
our own weaknesses.

427
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:39,900
But looking at kids
from the other schools,

428
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:42,150
I can't help but wonder
if our competitive sides

429
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:44,817
aren't somewhat lacking.

430
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,108
You might be right.

431
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,650
I don't know if we'd
be able to muster up

432
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:50,108
that kind of force and power
in the pursuit of victory

433
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:51,942
like they do.

434
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:54,108
[WANNAI] And I do believe
what we've been taught.

435
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:57,567
I don't think it's right to hurt
others or look down on them.

436
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,108
But...

437
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:01,442
I wonder if we shouldn't learn
how to fight competitively.

438
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:03,358
Just in case.

439
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,692
Honestly...

440
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:07,858
I've never gotten angry,
not even in the one fight.

441
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:10,442
So that's why you asked
me about that earlier.

00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,983
--Well, I'm in the same boat.
--[WANNAI] I've got it!

Would you mind trying
to get angry with me

I'm glad you have
so much spirit.

457
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:43,067
After all, every school
should be trying to win

458
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,442
this competition.

459
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:46,567
However, we are one of
the five who actually have

460
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,192
a shot at taking the title.

461
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:50,358
We are not going to roll over
and lose just because

462
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:52,025
you wish us to.

463
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,150
Tokiwadai will beat you
so badly that you'll be telling

464
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:57,733
your grandchildren
how fearsome we are.

465
00:19:57,817 --> 00:19:59,900
Look at Kongo,
talking a big game!

466
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:02,942
Such poise in the face
of such furious opposition!

467
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:04,150
Very impressive!

Let's show them what
a real cheer looks like.

00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:09,900
Go.

better than that!

[F TOKIWADAI C]
This is unfortunate.

476
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,442
What are we going to do?

477
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:20,608
[WANNAI]
Is there a problem?

478
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:22,858
Well, yes.

479
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,442
The next contest
is about to start,

480
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,775
but Misaka is nowhere
to be found.

481
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:27,817
[WANNAI]
Oh.

[MISAKA SISTER A] "Once again,
Misaka finds herself watching

483
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:33,983
the games.

484
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,192
But it is not as if she
is depressed about being

485
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:38,775
unable to compete,
you understand. Yeah,"

486
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:41,817
says Misaka, at odds
with her emotions.

[CAT meows]

00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,567
Although she cannot deny
that there is some feeling

489
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,358
of alienation.

490
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:49,608
There! Hey, Misaka!

491
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:50,567
[MISAKA SISTER A]
Yes?

492
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,733
[WANNAI]
Huh?

493
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,317
Why aren't you wearing
your gym uniform?

494
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,442
We're all supposed to be.

00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:56,650
[AWATSUKI]
Oh, I bet I know.

496
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,733
I saw the three-legged
race earlier.

497
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:01,067
You took it off because those
other girls got it all dirty,

498
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,483
didn't you?

499
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:04,817
Oh, yeah, and you have
nothing else to change into!

500

In that case,
you can borrow mine.

[MIKOTO]
Oh, man!

502
00:21:11,942 --> 00:21:13,192
I thought if I used my ability,

503
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:14,692
I could get there
and back in time,

504
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:15,983
but this is pushing it!

505
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:21,317
Hey, everyone,
sorry I'm late! I--

506
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,275
It's not too small
on you, is it?

507
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:25,608
It shouldn't obstruct
any movement.

508
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:28,192
In fact, it's quite loose
across the chest.

509
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:30,483
I'll take care of the little one
while you're out there.

Huh?

511
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,483
[WANNAI]
Is something wrong?

512
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:37,192
No, I just thought I saw
someone for a second.

513
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:40,692
[MIKOTO groans]
What in the world is she doing?

514
00:21:40,775 --> 00:21:43,442
[KOZAKU] So?
How is everything coming along?

515
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:45,067
In place and at the ready.

516
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,150
There shouldn't be
any problems at all.

517
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:48,525
Just like you wanted.

518
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:51,025
This is going to render her
completely powerless.

Baba, we're getting started.

Oh, my bad! On my way!

Well, well, he sounds
confident, doesn't he?

522
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,608
I guess I should expect
as much from MEMBER,

523
00:22:00,692 --> 00:22:04,650
the dark side outfit directly
under the governing board.

524
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:06,358
But I'll reserve judgment
until I see what

525

he's actually capable of.
