1
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:36,692
[MIYAMA] Foreseen phenomena
are basically etched in stone.

2
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:38,692
Actions taken to change
them can only make

3
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:40,108
a small degree of difference.

4
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:43,275
The core of the event will
happen no matter what.

5
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:45,483
So basically there's
no escaping fate.

6
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:47,067
Is that what you mean?

7
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,400
Something like that.

8
00:00:48,483 --> 00:00:51,442
I don't know if anything
as occult as fate is real,

9
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:54,525
but there might be some
causative principle at work.

10
00:00:54,608 --> 00:00:59,233
Unfortunately, precognition is
a poorly understood field.

11
00:00:59,317 --> 00:01:03,233
But every prediction has
proved to be unavoidable

12
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:06,233
until the one you changed today.

13
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,483
We don't know much
about my ability just yet,

14
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:10,358
but it seems to be
based on calculations

15
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:12,650
in a three-dimensional
framework.

16
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:15,775
And ordinarily, that pathway
I predict can't be altered.

17
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:18,233
[UIHARU gasps] Then there's
Shirai's teleporting.

18
00:01:18,317 --> 00:01:20,400
It's based on 11 dimensions!

19
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:22,442
Do you think that's why
it's capable of interfering

20
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:25,192
with an unavoidable
three-dimensional outcome?

21
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:27,608
Well it's all just theoretical.

22
00:01:27,692 --> 00:01:28,858
[KUROKO]
What is that?

23
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:30,650
It's only your average penlight.

24
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:33,108
But I like to carry it around
for times like these.

25
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:34,817
It makes it easier to
concentrate when using

26
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,150
my second-stage.

27
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:39,025
I could've been lying to you.

28
00:01:39,108 --> 00:01:41,608
But a demonstration will
prove I'm telling the truth.

29
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:43,442
So I'm going to use my power
to predict something

30
00:01:43,525 --> 00:01:45,275
that isn't recorded
in the app yet.

Go ahead and scan
that photo with the app.

33
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,317
[UIHARU]
Uh, okay.

34
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:11,900
[UIHARU]
Here it is.

35
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:14,400
Less than a kilometer
south-southwest of here.

36
00:02:14,483 --> 00:02:17,233
[KUROKO] Let me tag along
and confirm this for myself.

37
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:19,567
[UIHARU] It looks like it
happens in 40 minutes.

38
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,942
[RIVER GIRL A]
This is dangerous.

39

We should go get a grown-up.

It's totally fine!

Help!

46

[UIHARU] Good thing
you brought life rings.

47
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:22,358
It made sense since
the location was a river.

[RIVER GIRL B crying]

49
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:33,067
[MIYAMA] Was that enough
to verify my ability?

50
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,858
Yes, and what about mine to you?

51
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,275
That's the second time my
teleportation has intervened

52
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:38,942
with your precognition.

53
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:40,400
Not a bad deal, right?

54
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:42,275
As a member of Judgment,
I'm sure you can see

55
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:47,067
the value in helping victims
before they get hurt.

56
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,567
[KUROKO]
Not a bad deal at all.

Really?

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,150
I understand how you must feel,

66
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:11,233
but don't do anything
you're going to regret.

67
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:13,108
You should step in,
or this will end up uglier

68
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:14,192
than predicted.

How did that get out?

But you guys bumped into us--

What's that?

Do you have any idea

If you haven't heard, we're--

I'm sure Antiskill would
be very interested

in knowing you who are.

79

--You're pretty good at this.
--[KUROKO] Thank you.

81
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:45,025
[NEWSCASTER A] We have some
further information on that mass

82
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:47,025
unconsciousness incident
the other day.

83
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:48,608
According to a
release from Antiskill,

84
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:50,983
the victims are not showing
any discernable aftereffects,

85
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:53,525
but the cause is still
unknown at the moment.

86
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:55,025
Well, that's interesting.

87
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:58,358
It looks as though your
ability missed that one.

88
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,900
I can't say for sure,
but maybe it didn't register

89
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:03,858
'cause they were only asleep
and didn't really get hurt.

90
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:05,817
Plus, I don't know
if I've told you,

91
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,817
but it prioritizes incidents
that are close to me.

92
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,108
When I think about it that way,

93
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:13,150
it's more of a roundabout
way of sensing danger.

94
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:16,442
But, since nothing I do can
change the outcome anyway,

95
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:19,442
sensing it doesn't
do me much good.

96
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:21,150
--Here.
--[KUROKO] Huh?

97
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:22,900
[MIYAMA]
For your leg.

98
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,942
[KUROKO] Oh. I must've
scraped it at some point.

99
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:27,775
[MIYAMA] Even if you're
gonna treat it later,

100
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:30,983
you should still
wipe it down now.

101
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:32,650
You may come off a bit cold.

102
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:35,483
But I have to admit, you do
know how to treat a lady.

103
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:38,108
[MIYAMA] Well, I make an effort
to be considerate toward women

104
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:40,358
as much as possible.

105
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,192
Even if that woman is
someone like you, Kuroko.

106
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:46,858
You should have quit
while you were ahead. Jeez.

Hey, why did you join Judgment?

[KUROKO]
Huh?

109
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:53,358
Well... How can I put this?

110
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:56,567
I guess I would say it's to
maintain order in the city.

111
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,942
So for the sake of justice?

112
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:00,358
Sort of.

113
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:02,608
Though I can't say I was
prepared to put it into words.

114
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,733
[MIYAMA] I don't really
understand things that don't

115
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:09,108
have a clear reasoning
behind them, myself.

[MIYAMA grunts]

118
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,108
[MIYAMA]
I have a new prediction.

00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:26,400
[KUROKO] You look somewhat pale.
Are you okay?

120
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:28,108
[MIYAMA]
I'm just a little anemic.

121
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,358
Is that... the park?

122
00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:36,400
[UIHARU] The time is tomorrow,
in the late afternoon.

123
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:39,608
Miyama, is something the matter?

124
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,442
Just look.

125
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:43,317
[KUROKO]
Two of them in the same park?

126
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,942
This is the first time we've
seen that happen.

127
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,775
[MIYAMA] This one is a
prediction I had before I met

128
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:49,025
you two.

129
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:50,608
Both predictions are
supposed to happen

130
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:52,192
at just about the same time.

131
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:53,567
Could they be related?

132
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,775
Like they're both part of the
same accident somehow?

133
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:57,817
Maybe. But the two incidents
are separated

134
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,025
by several hundred meters.

135
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:02,150
The first photo has
already been analyzed.

136
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,192
I used the machine back
at the research lab,

137
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,775
but like I told you,
they always come out blurry.

138
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:09,775
From what I could make out,
I think there was a lot of fire.

139
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:11,108
A fire?

140
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:12,942
Would it be possible for us
to see the analysis

141
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:13,983
of that photo?

142
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,483
[MIYAMA]
Sorry.

143
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,067
I don't have it, and it's not
very easy to sneak things

144
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,442
out of the lab.

145
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:20,025
If you're right and the two
predictions are related

146
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:22,108
to each other,
then that means this fire

147
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:25,067
would cover an
alarmingly wide area.

148
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,358
So a fire, an explosion,
pyrokinesis.

149
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:31,692
I can't think of anything else
we might be dealing with here.

150
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:34,192
And if it stretches
over such a large area,

151
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:35,817
there's a high chance
that people other than

152
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,775
the two he predicted will be
caught in the middle of it.

153
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:40,233
In that case,

154
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:42,650
This is beyond what we can
reasonably deal with alone.

155
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:45,525
If I promise to keep you out
of this as much as possible,

156
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,067
can I ask for assistance?

157
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:51,775
[AOMI]
Excuse me!

158
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:54,317
This month happens to
be Crime Prevention Month.

159
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,067
Would it be all right if we
checked your student IDs

160
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,400
before you entered?

161
00:08:57,483 --> 00:08:58,317
[PARK MAN A]
Sure.

162
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
We appreciate it.

163
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,275
[KONORI] He's not in
possession of any explosives

164
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:05,650
or hazardous materials.

165
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:07,233
[AOMI]
Great. All set.

166
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:09,275
Thanks very much
for your cooperation.

167
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:12,192
[KUROKO] We've got checkpoints
set up at every park entrance.

168
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:14,650
We'll cross-check esper
abilities with the Bank,

169
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:18,983
ban any hazardous materials,
and search for any already here.

170
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:21,275
Including the help provided
from other branches,

171
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:23,942
Judgment's presence here
is 40 members strong.

172
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:25,817
I'm relieved,
but also surprised.

173
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,067
We're lucky they agreed to come
with our vague explanation.

174
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,025
[KONORI] Well, to be honest,
it's not that hard

175
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:33,358
to figure out what's
going on here.

176
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:35,358
Those girls have been
at every incident lately,

177
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,025
saving people
before they're hurt.

178
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:39,608
There's gotta be some sort
of precognition involved.

179
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:41,067
[KONORI] Some Judgment
members were asking why

180
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,192
we didn't shut down
the park entirely,

181
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:45,358
and I can't help
but wonder myself,

182
00:09:45,442 --> 00:09:48,317
but there must be some
reason why we can't.

183
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,233
I wish we had a better
idea of what stage

184
00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:52,400
your ability interferes
with the future.

185
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:53,733
If we did, we could
plan this out

186
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:55,108
much more efficiently.

187
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:56,608
[KUROKO]
Yes, I agree.

188
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,775
We can't close the park since
that might move the fire,

189
00:09:58,858 --> 00:10:01,608
so for now we just have
to keep an eye out.

190
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:03,108
Two more hours.

191
00:10:03,192 --> 00:10:06,400
[UIHARU] There. Hey, Shirai.
Put this on for me.

192
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:12,067
[KUROKO]
What is it?

193
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,608
That's satellite imagery.

194
00:10:13,692 --> 00:10:15,858
It should let you see where
everyone in the park is.

195
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:18,067
I figured it'd be useful
for the operation.

196
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,442
Wow!

197
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:22,400
You got permission to--
Wait, did you hack into it?

198
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:24,608
Lives are more
important than rules.

199
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,525
Also, witnesses
have recently reported

200
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:29,567
an increase in stray cats
and dogs at the garbage dump.

201
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:32,567
You okay?

202
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,233
[KUROKO] Yes, it's just...
those cherry blossoms.

203
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:37,442
It's October--
not exactly their season.

204
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:38,567
Does that happen?

205
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,858
[UIHARU]
Hmm...

206
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:41,567
Well, after the temperature
drops considerably

207
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,317
and then gets warm again,

208
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,442
I think cherry blossoms
will sometimes get tricked

209
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:47,608
into thinking spring has come.

210
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:49,608
[KUROKO] Have we had that
kind of weather, though?

211
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:51,608
[UIHARU]
No, we haven't.

212
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,442
[ringing]

213
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:00,442
[KUROKO]
Is something wrong?

214
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:02,067
I've made more predictions.

215
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,858
Two this time.

216
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:06,692
Both of them take place
inside the park, too.

217
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:08,942
These aren't that close
to the previous two.

218
00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:10,900
They're spread about the park.

219
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:12,733
Thank you. This is helpful.

220
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:15,233
If we refocus our search
based on this layout--

[KUROKO]
His red blood cells are damaged?

223
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:28,900
Hmm. That's right,
and as a result,

224
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:32,067
they're struggling to
transport oxygen properly.

225
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,442
It's rare, but it's a
phenomenon occasionally seen

226
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:37,275
when espers overexert
their abilities.

227
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:38,358
As you can imagine,

228
00:11:38,442 --> 00:11:40,150
I recommend he refrain
from using it

229
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,483
for the time being.

230
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,108
Otherwise, he could be
putting his life in danger.

231
00:11:46,983 --> 00:11:49,025
[KUROKO] Why would you do
something so reckless?

232
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,025
[OKAWACHI]
Hey. Hey!

Your ability lets you see
when bad things happen

235
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:02,150
to people, right?

236
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:04,275

It just shows people suffering.

242
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,483
But maybe if I'm lucky,
someday in the future

243
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:23,400
it can be used to help
people somehow.

244
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:25,483
Who knows?
Maybe it could protect them.

245
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,150
Yeah, right.

because you foresaw it?

Are you sure you don't bring
misfortune to people?

00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:47,817
This can't be a regular fire.

317
00:15:49,108 --> 00:15:53,025
The things burning the
worst are the cherry trees.

318
00:15:53,108 --> 00:15:54,483
Cherry blossoms.

319
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:57,108
They do seem out of place
with them blooming

320
00:15:57,192 --> 00:15:58,525
out of season.

321
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:00,025
What's causing it?

322
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:05,317
Did you say that there
are plant ampules?

323
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,650
[KUROKO]
Yes.

324
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,150
Whatever it is that's been
injected into the ground

325
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,983
beneath the trees is
likely highly flammable.

326
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,942
If you're right, then once
this mystery substance

327
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:14,650
has passed into
the soil and trees,

328
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:16,567
all the rows of cherry
blossoms would effectively

329
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,650
become one giant fuse!

330
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:19,858
All right.

331
00:16:19,942 --> 00:16:21,067
Simulating the spread
of the fire based on

332
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,525
that hypothesis now.

333
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,275
You can use the simulation
to decide where to go next.

334
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:30,608
[MIYAMA]
Perro.

335

[UIHARU]
Shirai!

336
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,317
[KUROKO]
This girl is the last one.

337
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,817
I looked into those ampules.

338
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,442
We found a bunch of them
at the bases of trees

339
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:40,275
around here, too.

340
00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:43,067
Sure enough, they don't appear
to be commercially made.

341
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:49,067
[GROUP gasps]

342
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,942
Well, that's all we needed to
see to prove your hypothesis.

343
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:53,150
Yes.

344
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:54,942
But who on earth would
do something like this?

345
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:56,650
[MIYAMA]
Kuroko?

[KUROKO]

[MIYAMA]
I need your help.

Can you please teleport
me into the middle

349
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:05,608
of the park grounds?

350
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,733
It might serve as
interference or something.

351
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:11,942
Slow down.

352
00:17:12,025 --> 00:17:13,942
Take a deep breath and
tell me what's going on.

353
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:21,442
A stray dog?

354
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:23,233
That was your first prediction
that was in the park,

355
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:24,400
wasn't it?

356
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:27,858
[MIYAMA]
Yeah, but he's my friend, so...

357
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:30,775
Can you tell me what
this dog looks like?

358
00:17:30,858 --> 00:17:33,317
Uiharu, check the
satellite imagery for me.

359
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,775
The smoke is too thick.

360
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:36,817
Hold on. If I remove
the unaffected areas,

361
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
I'll be able to narrow
it down in a minute.

[KUROKO]
Konori!

Okay.

Let's do it.

365
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:47,025
[KUROKO]
That kid.

366
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,900
I had a feeling he might
be hiding something from us.

367
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:51,483
But did he really think
we wouldn't help him

368
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:54,192

Next!

00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:10,400
Not here. Or here.

[MIYAMA]
Kuroko!

375
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:24,108
Come back here and
send me in there instead!

376
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:26,442
I'm being too selfish.
I have been from the start!

377
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:28,942
Teleporting can interfere
with my predictions, yes.

378
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,442
But that doesn't mean
it will always change

379
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:32,942
the future for the better.
It might not!

380
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:34,942
I shouldn't have gotten
you involved in this mess.

I can't let you become
a victim, too!

382
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,775
This is a much bigger disaster
than any of the others.

383

You don't have to be
so willing to--

[KUROKO]
Miyama.

385
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:45,233
If you risking your own health

386
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:47,900
to rescue a stray dog
is selfish,

387
00:18:47,983 --> 00:18:51,275
then my refusal to back down
now is plenty selfish too.

388

I found him! He's limping away
from the fire over there!

Just watch.

390

Because what some people
might call selfishness

is the very thing that you
and I would call justice!

Good work out there.

That was a close call,
but we're in one piece.

It's a good thing I had
those ampules.

opposite direction the fire

Judging by your face, I'm
guessing we got the right dog.

Other than his left hind leg,

I don't see any
obvious injuries,

though he may have
inhaled some smoke.

We can take him
to the vet together

That's right.

of the fire,
just like you thought.

The people who put them
there said they thought

416
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:16,192
they'd developed
some sort of substance

417
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:17,942
that would allow the
cherry blossoms to bloom

no idea that it essentially

Yeah. For sure.

But even if I can't see him
as often as I do now,

433
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,858
since he's alive, I can visit.

434

He's only alive because
you saved him, you know.

Not true, without your
predictions to warn me,

known to help Perro
