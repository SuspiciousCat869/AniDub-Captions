1
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:39,400
[RADIO DJ] And our next
competition is Balloon Hunter!

2
00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:42,233
In this contest, 30 students
chosen from each school

3
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:43,817
will compete to pop
the paper balloons

4
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,358
attached to their
opponents' heads using

5
00:00:45,442 --> 00:00:47,817
the designated beanbags!

6
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,525
Contestants whose balloons
are popped are disqualified,

7
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:52,317
and the team with the
most students remaining

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,483
at the end wins.

9
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:56,192
The game area is pretty wide,

10
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:58,608
but going indoors or onto
any roads still open

11
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,775
to the public is
strictly prohibited.

12
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:03,400
It's time we get going, Misaka.

13
00:01:03,483 --> 00:01:04,692
Uh...

14
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:06,900
[F TOKIWADAI 03A]
Kongo, we're about to begin!

15
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:10,525
[RADIO DJ] Now, are all of
the teams ready to start?

16
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:12,817
[KONGO] You didn't tuck
your tail and run away.

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,275
I'll give you points for that.

18
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,567
Heh. Yeah, yeah,
let's see if you're still

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,817
talking smack when this is over.

20
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,692
[RADIO DJ]
Ready... Set...

21
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:22,150
[gun fires]

22
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:23,650
Huh?

23
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:26,483
[M STUDENT 03A] That's it!
Keep running as far as you can!

24
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:29,775
If we all make it through this,
we'll force them into a tie!

25
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:32,025
Wow. They're not
very direct, are they?

26
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:34,525
Let's go after them!

27
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:37,233
"Pursuing individually
is dangerous.

28
00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:39,650
We should divide
into three-man teams,"

29
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:42,525
Says Misaka, proposing a...

30
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,817
Oh, well, then.

31
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:50,483
[MIKOTO] I want to say,
"how did this end up happening?"

32
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:54,400
But it's really not
that hard to imagine.

33
00:01:54,483 --> 00:01:56,358
I guess the fact that
no one could tell us apart

34
00:01:56,442 --> 00:01:58,067
is lucky in a way.

35
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,650
But it's also
pretty disheartening,

36
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:03,150
when I think about it.

37
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:06,567
Well, no use worrying
about what's already done.

38
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,067
Since you're filling
in for me anyway,

39
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,733
make me look good
out there, will you?

40
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:45,275
[SATEN] Are you sure you don't
have to go out on patrol?

41
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,067
[UIHARU] I do have to go
on patrol, just not "out."

42
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,817
I can do it all online.

43
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,983
Since we're dealing with
such a large-scale event,

44
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:54,192
they're anticipating a
number of cyberattacks,

45
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,900
so they need extra
help on the net.

46
00:03:55,983 --> 00:03:59,942
Ahh, and that's right
up your alley, isn't it?

47
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:01,483
[RADIO DJ] Three minutes
have passed since the start

48
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:02,733
of the balloon hunter game,

49
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:04,900
and there's still no one
out from either team.

50
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:07,400
Who will be the one
to break this tie?

51
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:09,317
Hey, isn't that the event
that Misaka said

52
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,025
she was competing in next?

53
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:13,025
Yeah, that must be the one.

54
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:15,775
I wonder if she changed
her clothes in time.

55
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:17,650
Well, it is Misaka
we're talking about.

56
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,692
I bet she made it.

57
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:21,525
Look, Kongo!

58
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:23,817
Everyone, let's try
splitting up!

59
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,358
[GROUP]
Right!

60
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:27,233
[SATEN] So they're just
supposed to pop the balloons

61
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:29,108
on each other's heads?

62
00:04:29,192 --> 00:04:31,150
Tokiwadai has more
than just Misaka.

63
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:33,983
There's tons of strong
espers that go there.

64
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,108
I can't imagine they'd lose.

65
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,108
[UIHARU]
Hmm...

66
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:40,067
I'm not so certain.

67
00:04:43,775 --> 00:04:45,775
Why don't you just
give up already?

68
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,817
A telekinetic, huh?

69
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,483
Let me guess, you lured me here?

70
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:54,483
[OMOSHI chuckles]

71
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:56,400
Feels cheap doin'
this to a girl.

72
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:57,567
But don't worry,

73
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,942
I'm not trying to
hit you in your face!

74
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:02,983
That the best you got?

75
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:07,067
I take it you're not even
a Level 3 then, are you?

76
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,025
I just so happen to be
a telekinetic as well.

77
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:13,358
Luckily, it seems I'm
significantly more skilled

78
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:15,025
at it than you.

79
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:16,275
[OMOSHI]
Damn!

80
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,942
Do you really expect
to dodge them all?

81
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:28,192
[RADIO DJ]
Contestant Omoshi is out!

82
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:29,483
[KIRIFU]
Too easy.

83
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:32,192
At this rate, I could take
all of you on myself

84
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:35,108
and not even break a sweat.

85
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:37,400
It won't be long before
the rest of you are elimi--

86
00:05:39,608 --> 00:05:41,483
[RADIO DJ]
Contestant Kirifu is out!

87
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:42,817
Huh?!

88
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,150
But that attack happened
after he was disqualified!

89
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:47,025
That's a completely
illegal move!

90
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:48,650
[OMOSHI chuckles]

91
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:51,233
It would be, if I had done it.

92
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,108
[rustling]

93
00:05:53,192 --> 00:05:55,692
Um, hey there.

94
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:57,650
She's the one who
actually used her power

95
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:58,983
to throw that at you.

96
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,567
You dropped your guard,
thinking it was over.

97
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,567
Level 4, telekinetic
Megumi Kirifu.

98
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,442
[gasps] Why do you
know my full name?

99
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:09,650
Because we know we're
weaker than your school.

100
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:12,150
We found out everything
there is to know about you

101
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:14,817
and came up with
some strategies.

102
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:19,442
[KOBAYASHI]
All right, girls.

103
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:22,233
Is everyone in position?

104
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:23,692
Moments ago,

105
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:26,900
I saw at least five members
of the other team nearby.

106
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:29,275
They were entering
this very alleyway.

107
00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:31,858
Thankfully, we are in
control of all three exits

108
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:33,817
leading out of the area.

109
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,025
I'll send the signal to move
out in a few seconds,

110
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:37,650
with my telepathy.

111
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:43,233
[KOBAYASHI]
Okay, three, two...

112
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:45,692
...one?

113
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:51,817
[KOBAYASHI screams]

114
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,358
Take it easy, Kobayashi!

115
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:55,858
I feel like my head's
gonna explode!

116
00:06:55,942 --> 00:06:57,775
[M STUDENT 03A] Screams that
are delivered telepathically

117
00:06:57,858 --> 00:06:59,525
echo directly within the brain.

118
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:04,608
It amounts to a sonic weapon
that can't be blocked out.

119
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,817
Oh, and that's a fake spider.

120
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,483
So you can chill.

121
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,192
[F TOKIWADAI 02B]
They just keep running away.

122
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:13,983
Why won't they quit?

123
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:19,067
[F TOKIWADAI 02B gasps]
Mud? That's gross.

124
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,067
Do we have to go through here?

125
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,858
Our shoes are going
to get filthy.

126
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:26,983
I'm sure there's some
other way through.

127
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:29,025
Yeah. I mean, there's gotta be.

128
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,067
[M STUDENT 03C]
There they go.

129
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,150
With no idea we're
leading them around.

130
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,483
Incredible!

131
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:39,108
We're playing Tokiwadai
like a fiddle!

132
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,817
It's just like you said, Baba.

133
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,317
Good call.

134
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,983
Hey. I just collected some data
and made some suggestions.

135
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:46,317
No big.

136
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,067
Maybe, but how'd you get
such detailed information?

137
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,567
Like personalities
and weaknesses?

138
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,150
It's 'cause I have a friend over
at the Garden of Learning.

139
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:55,317
Connections, man.

140
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,108
[M STUDENT 03C]
Hey, what do we do next?

141
00:07:57,192 --> 00:07:58,692
Oh. Gimme a sec.

142
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:01,483
[BABA] Sure enough,
wars are won with detailed

143
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:05,108
intelligence and leaders who
can make effective use of it.

144
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:07,192
Know thy enemy and know thyself,

145
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:10,567
and even these idiots
will make good pawns.

146
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,567
Oh, that's right.

147
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,733
'Kay, let's head out. Baba?

148
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:17,817
[BABA]
Hm? Okay, let's go.

149
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:23,192
[M STUDENT 03D] Things are
going pretty smoothly so far.

150
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:24,567
We've got a healthy lead.

151
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,442
Let's not get too cocky.

152
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:29,233
They do have Mikoto
Misaka on their team.

153
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:32,025
She can sense we're coming,
so we can't sneak attack.

154
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:34,275
She's like a fortress.

155
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:38,942
[M STUDENT 03D] Well, we don't
have to eliminate everyone.

156
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:42,108
[M STUDENT 03C] Yeah. No reason
to take that kinda risk.

157
00:08:42,192 --> 00:08:44,942
We should tell everyone
not to go near her.

158
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,525

00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:57,358
"Yes?" says Misaka, suspecting
that you feel the same way.

315
00:15:57,442 --> 00:16:00,233
She failed to fulfill her
role as your substitute.

316
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:02,150
[MIKOTO]
But did you have fun?

317
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:03,608
[MISAKA 10032]
Hm?

318
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:06,192
[MIKOTO] I asked if you had
fun competing in the game.

319
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:07,817
[MISAKA 10032]
Oh. Yes.

320
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,858
[MIKOTO] Then there's
nothing to feel down about.

321
00:16:09,942 --> 00:16:12,192
I wasn't happy about the mix-up,

322
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:14,692
but when you got mistaken
for me, what could you do?

323
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:17,192
And it's my own fault for
being late in the first place.

324
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:19,525
All things considered,
you did pretty well.

325
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:22,317
Better than I would have done
at the end, that's for sure.

326
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:25,775
Good job.

327
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:26,942
[gasps]

328
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:27,942
[purrs]

329
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:29,858
[MIKOTO]
It's just about lunchtime.

330
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:31,692
Have you had anything to eat?

331
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,025
[MISAKA 10032]
No.

332
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:34,608
Here.

333
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:36,900
They're street stall vouchers
they gave out to the students.

334
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:39,192
I'm supposed to grab some
food with my mama,

335
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:41,942
so you can use them
if you feel like it.

336
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:44,025
Street stalls, you say?

337
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:46,025
[MIKOTO]
We're at a festival, remember?

338
00:16:46,108 --> 00:16:49,692
We can't forget
to have some fun.

339
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:50,983
Oh, and don't forget,

340
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:53,442
those gym clothes you've
got on are Wannai's.

341
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:55,733
Get them back to her
as soon as you can.

342
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:02,442
[MIKOTO] I know it's okay to
bring your own food in here,

343
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:03,900
but I get the feeling
that doesn't include

344
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:06,275
your own pot filled
with cheese fondue.

345
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,483
[MISUZU]
Oh, it's fine.

346
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:08,733
Plus, isn't this nice?

347
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:10,733
A mother and daughter
having fondue together

348
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:12,150
during the festival.

349
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:13,692
[MIKOTO]
I guess.

350
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:15,442
[MISUZU sighs] But it's gonna
be a while before the cheese

351
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:16,858
is melted all the way.

352
00:17:16,942 --> 00:17:19,275
Maybe I should have cut
it up into smaller pieces.

353
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:21,983
[MIKOTO] Then how about I go
buy us something to drink?

354
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:24,608
Okay. I'd sure like some wine.

355
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:26,608
They definitely don't have that.

356
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:32,900
[MIKOTO gasps] Ah, man.
It's just as crowded out here.

357
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:37,442
[KAMIJO]
Oh! You, too, huh?

358
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:38,942
Well, look who it is.

359
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,358
This sucks, doesn't it?

360
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:42,275
There are lines
everywhere you go.

361
00:17:42,358 --> 00:17:44,567
Yeah, I know, I've had
to wait forever.

362
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,025
Ol' Kamijo here very
nearly wet himself.

363
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,942
[MIKOTO gasps]
What are you talking about?

364
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:50,817
So you weren't talking
about the bathroom lines

365
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,192
being insanely long?

366
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:54,650
[MIKOTO] No, I'm just trying
to buy some drinks here!

367
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:55,858
Oh! My bad.

368
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,692
[MIKOTO groans]
You are so crude.

369
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:00,108
[KAMIJO] Tell you what,
I'll go stand in line

370
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:02,650
and grab some extra drinks,
so there'll be plenty.

371
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:05,442
I doubt my mom packed
enough for everyone.

372
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:07,400
I'll get some for you, too!

373
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:08,608
[grunts]

374
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:11,567
[MIKOTO] And you're also
too nice sometimes.

375
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,817
[SHOKUHO]
See? What did I say?

376
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,608
It's just like I told you.

377
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,150
[KEITZ]
Yeah. You're right.

378
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:17,483
Still, I'm surprised
you could tell

379
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:19,442
from the video
footage alone.

380
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:22,483
Ha! Menta l Out can be used
in many different ways,

381
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:23,900
depending on the situation.

382
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:25,817
But you don't need
to know specifics.

383
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,025
[KEITZ]
Fair enough.

384
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:29,650
I should have expected
as much from a level 5.

385
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,567
Flattery will get you nowhere.

386
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,400
All I need from you
are your keen powers

387
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:35,775
of observation, understand?

388
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:41,400
[gasps]
Well, well.

389
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:42,275
Ugh.

390
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:43,400
Hello, Misaka.

391
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:45,275
Enjoying a relaxing lunch?

392
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,608
Relaxing? What's that
supposed to mean?

393
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:49,567
Don't tell me you run to
some corner to train

394
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,608
instead of eating.

395
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:52,483
Of course not.

396
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:55,567
I used my ability to cancel
all of my afternoon events.

397
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,692
Huh?

398
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:58,983
After my busy morning,
I'm exhausted.

399
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:00,817
Jeez. Listen to you.

400
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,025
[KAMIJO]
Do you think this'll be enough,

401
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,692
or should I go get some more?

402
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,858
They mostly just had tea.

403
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:09,942
Eh... So, uh,
who's this lady here?

404
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,775
She's a classmate. Sort of.

405
00:19:12,858 --> 00:19:16,942
[KAMIJO]
She's in your grade?

406
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:19,525
[gasps] Oh! Like your
grade in school!

407
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:20,983
[MIKOTO]
Real smooth.

408
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:24,150
I swear his gaze dropped like
30 centimeters just now.

409
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:27,442
[SHOKUHO chuckles]
It's good to meet you, Kamijo.

[gasps]

411
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:31,483
If I may introduce myself,
I'm Misaka's very good friend.

412
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,900
You may call me Misaki Shokuho!

413
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:35,900
And it's a pleasure!

414
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:37,442
[MIKOTO]
What? Since when are we friends?

415
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:40,233
[SHOKUHO]
Aww. How scary!

416
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:42,608
Misaka doesn't seem
to like me very much.

417
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:45,192
She's always so charged
and tense with me!

418
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:48,983
[KAMIJO] Uh, yeah.
She's always jolty with me, too.

419
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:52,108
[SHOKUHO] Oh, yeah?
So she's charged and jolty?

420
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,900
Well that's fitting, isn't it?

421
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,150
[MIKOTO]
You two just met.

422
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:59,358
Stop bonding over making
bad puns about me!

423
00:20:01,525 --> 00:20:04,067
I'll be seeing you
around then, Misaka!

424
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,942
Compete hard enough
for the both of us!

Is everything okay?

428
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:19,483

thought, and that's pretty rare.

429

[SATEN]
Shouldn't you be working?

430
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:22,650
I have been.

431
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:23,858
In fact, there were
three significant

432
00:20:23,942 --> 00:20:25,775
server attacks earlier.

433
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,692
But they were barely above
the level of an amateur,

434
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,858
so I dealt with them in no time.

435
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:31,775
Oh. Cool.

436
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:33,942
[UIHARU]
What have you been up to, Saten?

437
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:39,025
I've been thinking.

438
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:42,108
But I have no idea where
to find some Shadow Metal.

439
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:44,775
Are you still going
on about that?

440
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:46,275
[SATEN]
If it's supposed to be created

441

whenever esper powers
clash with each other,

442
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,942
it'd probably be wherever
the toughest schools

443
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:52,275
have been competing.

444
00:20:52,358 --> 00:20:53,775
[UIHARU sighs]
Didn't Shirai warn you

445
00:20:53,858 --> 00:20:55,858
about believing those rumors?

446
00:20:55,942 --> 00:20:57,108
Why so desperate?

447
00:20:57,192 --> 00:20:59,108
Are you in financial
trouble or something?

448
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:00,442
[SATEN]
No.

449
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:03,483
I mean, I'm not exactly
rolling in dough, either.

450
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:06,317
I guess I'm just
looking for adventure.

451
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,942
Imagine finding something
most people think is fake,

something you'd never
see in a million years

just going about your life.

454
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:15,858
It's a little like
being a level 5.

Eh, what the heck.

If you wouldn't mind a partner,
I could help you look for it.

What was it again?
"Shadow Metal?"

459
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:32,900
I'll poke around for whatever
information I can find.

Aww. That's my girl, Uiharu!

How come you're wearing
your gym shorts under here?

00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:42,192
So I can participate in
an event right away.

Um, please don't tug.

Cotton candy. Candy apples.

What must they taste like?

The yakisoba might
have onions in it,

so we can rule that
one out immediately.
