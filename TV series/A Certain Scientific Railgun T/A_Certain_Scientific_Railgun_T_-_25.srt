Watch your five!

That one's probably
the main unit!

00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:50,067
Hold on! Your line of fire's--

4
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,108
[DOPPEL]
Why?

5
00:01:10,942 --> 00:01:12,233
Why did you miss me?

6
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,525
[MIKOTO]
So that is her real goal.

7
00:01:16,608 --> 00:01:17,650
Thought so.

8
00:01:21,692 --> 00:01:23,108
[DOPPEL]
What's the matter?

9
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:25,608
Are you trying to set
Academy City ablaze?

10
00:01:28,817 --> 00:01:31,358
[MIKOTO]
Those bluffs won't work anymore.

11
00:01:31,442 --> 00:01:34,275
I don't think you would do that.

12
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:36,025
Can't you just live
like you are now?

13
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:37,192
What's wrong with that?

14
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:41,942
What a cruel thing to ask of me.

15
00:01:42,025 --> 00:01:44,608
If you suddenly learned one day

16
00:01:44,692 --> 00:01:46,483
that you were
just a counterfeit,

17
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:49,317
a lie covered with
a layer of skin,

18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,192
would you have the confidence
to maintain your identity?

19
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:55,692
If you think simply continuing
to operate is enough

20
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:58,275
to bring happiness to a machine,

21
00:01:58,358 --> 00:02:00,983
your human ego betrays you.

22
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:04,067
Okay, fair enough.
But I mean, there--

23
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,192
[DOPPEL] To be in this body
is to be reminded

24
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,650
every waking moment
that I have no soul.

25
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:10,942
Continuing to exist within
a form that does not

26
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:13,900
allow any reprieve
from that is torture.

27
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:15,942
Please.

28
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:27,067
If this is what you want...

[MIKOTO panting]

30
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:47,608
[DOPPEL]
Good work, Railgun.

31
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:48,692
I thank you.

32
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:51,067
You've got to be kidding me!

33
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,400
You're thanking me for this?

34
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:56,858
If you are troubled
by something this trivial,

35
00:02:56,942 --> 00:02:59,400
you are too soft
for your own good.

36
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:00,983
Be reasonable.

37
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:04,942
This is no different than
disposing of a broken appliance.

38
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:08,775
[MIKOTO]
Your goal was being destroyed.

39
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:10,817
And being permanently
destroyed meant getting rid

40
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,358
of the airship
with all of your data

41
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:14,608
and your creator.

42
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:17,858
Because Kuriba could use
that data to remake you.

43
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:20,317
But you can't kill yourself
'cause of your safety.

44
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,317
So you used those gas tanks,

45
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,233
hoping to get the city's
interception systems

46
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:26,733
to do the job for you.

47

[DOPPEL]
Yes.

While I can,

I'd like to propose something,

I'd talk with her.

Wait, wait, wait,

Hurry up and collect her parts!

Hold on!

Just let the Doppelganger
pass away peacefully!

What are you talking about?!

[KURIBA]
Chief. I can't do this.

67

I can't take part in this
experiment any longer.

You--?

69
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:27,067
[KURIBA] Torturing a subject
for profit or fame

70
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,317
isn't what I'd
call medical care.

71
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,275
It's just self-serving cruelty.

72
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:32,733
Just a second, now.

73
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:34,358
Do you have any idea
the good this research

74
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:35,442
will bring about?

75
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,650
[MIKOTO]
What you want

76
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:39,608
isn't even in the Doppelganger!

77
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:41,942
There's no soul inside of her.

78
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:45,067
It's just a fallacy,
caused by wishful thinking,

79
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,858
when you wanted results.

80
00:04:46,942 --> 00:04:48,025
That's all.

00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:52,775
[CHIEF RESEARCHER]
You--

82
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:56,733
You expect me to believe that?

I'm taking her with me,
no matter what!

84
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:00,733

This is ridiculous.

Do what I tell you to, or else!

00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:15,317
[MIKOTO] Their EM waves tell
me roughly where they are.

89
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,692
But if I'm not careful,
my attack could hit Kuriba.

90
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:20,400
There's a good chance
that masked kid

91
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:23,025
is watching what's
going on, but the airship

92
00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:25,567
drifted far from where she is.

93
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,233
And there's no telling
how long it would take her

00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:28,942
to get here by car.

00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:30,858
[CHIEF RESEARCHER] What nonsense
is this about her not having

96
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:31,900
a soul?

97
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:32,983
[MIKOTO]
It's true!

98
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,650
The whole "soul
possession" thing

99
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:38,233
was just an act that she put
on with artificial muscles.

You're lying!

[MIKOTO]
No, I'm not!

All this time, this poor girl
has been suffering

103
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,733
inside a synthetic body
that has no soul.

104
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:47,567
That's why she wanted
to be deactivated!

I disagree!
It's in there, just deeper!

Beyond even the artificial
muscles, it has to be!

If you really do have the

00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:26,983
[MIKOTO]
Mm-hmm.

162
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:29,025
You know that girl I had
you take to the hospital?

163
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,317
Apparently she's
out of intensive care.

164
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,275
It sounds like she's
recovering nicely.

165
00:08:33,358 --> 00:08:35,358
[KUROKO] Well, you couldn't
wish for better news than that.

166
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:37,650
[MIKOTO]
And it's all because of you.

167
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,525
Thanks a lot.

168
00:08:39,608 --> 00:08:41,150
Oh, no. Think nothing of it.

169
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:43,192
I simply wanted to see
this expression of joy

170
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:44,733
return to your face.

171
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:46,483
However, I certainly
wouldn't stop you

172
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,317
from showing your
gratitude if that's what

173
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,108
you'd like to do.

174
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:51,900
Yeah, I think I'll
pass on that one.

175
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:53,400
[SHOKUHO]
My word.

176
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:55,900
I see you two are
as close as ever.

177
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:57,025
[MIKOTO]
Shokuho.

178
00:08:57,108 --> 00:08:58,233
How do you do today?

179
00:08:58,317 --> 00:08:59,817
Misaka? Shirai?

180
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,733
What's up?

181
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:01,817
"How do you do today?"

182
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,150
Oh, yeah, by the way.

183
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,692
If it's about little Miss
Kuriba, I already know.

184
00:09:05,775 --> 00:09:07,900
I'm just as relieved she
pulled through as you are.

185
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:10,400
You worked hard out there.
Good job, Misaka.

186
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,900
I worked my butt off.
Don't be condescending.

187
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:15,525
[KUROKO]
What is happening here?

188
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:17,608
Is this about when you
snuck out the other night?

189
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:19,067
When you said you
made a "little deal"

190
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,317
did you mean you
were having a tryst

191
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,733
with Misaki Shokuho?

192
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:23,983
Uh... In a way, but...

193
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:26,317
While we're on the topic,
Sissy, did you two not used

194
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,900
to have more friction
between you?

195
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,483
When did you get to be so close?

196
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,983
Trust me, we haven't gotten
to be especially anything.

197
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:33,317
[KUROKO] Then why are
you keeping what you did

198
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,650
that night a secret?

199
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:36,442
You must be feeling
guilty about something!

200
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:38,400
[MIKOTO] What could I have
done that I'd feel guilty about?

201
00:09:38,483 --> 00:09:40,900
Your attempts to dodge the
question are not lost on me!

202
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:43,817
Oh, calm down, you have
nothing to worry about, Shirai.

203
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,150
Promise.

204
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:47,358
I'm not going to take
your Sissy away from you.

205
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:49,025
Well. If I have your word.

206
00:09:49,108 --> 00:09:50,525
But you never know.

207
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:54,108
Someday I may instead get
the urge to come and take you.

208
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:55,858
Or not!

209
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:57,025
[SATEN]
Hey, guys!

210
00:09:57,108 --> 00:09:58,400
Look who's here.

211
00:09:58,483 --> 00:09:59,983
[SATEN]
Hi there, Hokaze! What's up?

212
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,775
Uiharu, Saten, it's a
pleasure to see you again.

213
00:10:02,858 --> 00:10:04,400
How do you do today?

214
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:06,483
Great!
And how do you do today?

215
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:07,733
Chill, Uiharu.

216
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,442
Oh, wow.
You guys know each other?

217
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,067
Yeah, we actually just
met the other day

218
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,942
at the 177th branch.

219
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:14,233
Still killin' it here.

220
00:10:14,317 --> 00:10:15,608
Man! You really give off that

221
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:17,650
"put-together young
lady" energy.

222
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:19,608
Especially with those ringlets.

223
00:10:19,692 --> 00:10:21,483
That is so kind, thank you.

224
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,567
Oh! Allow me to introduce you.

225
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:29,025
This is Misaki Shokuho,
otherwise known as our Queen.

226
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:31,650
Whoa! Did she say "Queen?"

227
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:33,650
[SATEN]
Uiharu! It's her, in the flesh!

228
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,567
Believe me, I know!
What are we gonna do?

229
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,775
What a response.

230
00:10:36,858 --> 00:10:39,025
It's nice to meet you two.

231
00:10:39,108 --> 00:10:40,233
[SATEN, UIHARU]
Pleased to meet you!

232
00:10:40,317 --> 00:10:41,442
[SHOKUHO]
It's my pleasure.

233
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:42,442
You're so shameless.

234
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:43,442
[SHOKUHO]
Oh?

235
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:45,483
What was that?
I didn't hear you.

236
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:46,817
I didn't say anything.

237
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,317
Oh, Sissy!

238
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,525
[HOKAZE] Now listen up,
this is very important.

239
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,942
When speaking to the Queen,

240
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:55,192
there are rules that must
be observed at all times.

241
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:59,108
Really, there's never a dull
moment in this city, is there?

242
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,650
[MISAKA]
Hey, Shokuho, wait up!

243
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:04,108
[LEADER] Okay, so now
that we keep running into

244
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:06,608
these ridiculously
hard missions...

245
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:08,150
Does anyone have
any ideas as to how

246
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:09,942
we can improve Scavenger?

247
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:12,483
[NARU]
Ooh, ooh!

248
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,650
[LEADER]
Does anyone else have any ideas?

249
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:15,817
[NARU]
Huh?!

250
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,233
How come I'm not
good enough to pick?

251
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:20,483
[LEADER]
Agh, fine. Go ahead, Naru.

252
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:23,650
[NARU] Simply put, we need
ourselves a new member!

253
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,150
Someone who's got
the expertise to make up

254
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:26,358
for what we're missing!

255
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:28,358
Wow, Naru's actually
making sense for once.

256
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:30,692
[LEADER] All right,
so what are we missing?

257
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:32,025
A Yellow, duh!

258
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,858
--A Yellow?
--What does that mean?

259
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:36,275
Doesn't "Scavenger"
remind you of something?

260
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:38,608
Sounds like a superhero team.

261
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:40,317
Starting with me,
I'm the Pink one.

262
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,567
And Leader, you'd have
to be Red, right?

263
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,483
Seike, I was thinking
maybe you'd be Black,

264
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:45,858
but nah, you're Blue.

265
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:48,900
And Yakku, you're so
the White one, I can feel it.

266
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:50,483
Which means the
only essential color

267
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:51,775
we're missing is Yellow!

268
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:53,942
I guess so.
And, building off of that idea,

269
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:56,442
we could use your ability
to make us all paper outfits,

270
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:59,733
so we could pose and transform
and do a roll call and stuff.

271
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:00,900
That's what they do, right?

272
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:02,567
[LEADER]
Not a chance in hell.

273
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,775
I was just kidding.

274
00:12:03,858 --> 00:12:05,900
That's a great idea--
let's run with that!

275
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:07,608
[YAKUMARU] I'm gonna say
we should focus on polishing

276
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:09,692
our skills first.

277
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:12,775
[LEADER] Yeah, you're
probably right about that.

278
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,483
How can I be an objective judge
if I'm wearing it myself?

279
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:16,942
It'll just take a second!

280
00:12:20,983 --> 00:12:22,525
[NARU yells]

281
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:23,775
Why are you doing this?

282
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:25,192
You've seen me naked
a million times!

283
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:26,692
It's not like we have
a choice when you

284
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:28,233
just start stripping!

285
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:29,942
[NARU] Teammates are supposed
to be open with each other.

286
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:31,358
Not hide stuff!

287
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:33,400
[SEIKE] This is a very extreme
interpretation of that!

288
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:35,067
While we're on the topic
of team improvement,

289
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,858
my chemical stock
is starting to run low.

290
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,817
[SEIKE]
Would you just stop already?

291
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,317
Yeah. I should be able to
take a break soon enough.

292
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,192
'Cause if I recall, you can
only use your ability

293
00:12:47,275 --> 00:12:49,150
for like, three minutes
straight, right?

294
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:52,442
We should be just about there.

295
00:12:52,525 --> 00:12:54,733
[SEIKE] She was out to run
down the clock from the start?

296
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,233
As dumb as she is?

297
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:59,400
[SEIKE] Well, Naru can only
pay attention to something

298
00:12:59,483 --> 00:13:01,025
for about 30 minutes anyway.

299
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:03,108
I just have to kill time
outside until then.

300
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:06,942
When did she paper the door?

301
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:08,775
She knew I'd have to
stop my ability to grab

302
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:11,025
the doorknob and
was waiting for it!

303
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:17,858
[NARU] Come on now,
Seike, don't be shy.

304
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:19,775
Let me take a good look!

305
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:21,400
[SEIKE]
No!

306
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:24,150
There we go!

307
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:25,817
Sure enough, Seike,
you're definitely more

308
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,900
of a Blue than a Black!

309
00:13:27,983 --> 00:13:30,233
What was that, some kind
of performance art?

310
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:33,275
Now our bond as Scavenger
members has increased by--

311
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:35,775
[LEADER]
Both of you, be quiet.

312
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,108
[SCAVENGER LIASON]
First of all...

313
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,067
I'll start by saying good
work on your mission.

314
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,983
Though it sounds like
it was a bigger deal

315
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,775

[DOPPEL]
It's a dream.

473
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,983
Are you giving me an
opportunity to apologize?

474
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,525
[DOPPEL]
Apologize?

475
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:56,942
Why would you expect that?

476
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:59,817
I didn't try to kill you out of
resentment or anything.

477
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,692
It was but a requisite
condition, that's all.

478
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:05,108
Then again,
maybe me readily accepting

479
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:08,525
sacrifices for the sake of
accomplishing my mission

480
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,483
was a pattern of thought
I got from you

481
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:13,192
during our year together.

482
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:15,400
You knew that Indian Poker
would bring chaos

483
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:17,275
to society.

484
00:20:17,358 --> 00:20:18,942
But you didn't mind that.

485
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:21,192
As long as it gave you
the opportunity to save

486
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:23,108
your mother from her early fate.

487
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:25,483
That was all that
mattered to you.

488
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:27,400
You couldn't even
separate your own life

489
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:29,358
from your objective.

490
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:31,858
By your very nature,
you can't accomplish

491
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:34,942
anything unless you dedicate
your entire being to it.

492
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:40,567
But with that being said,
there's no need

493
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,150
to fight against who you are.

494
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:44,775
You can't let yourself
become someone

495
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:47,150
who's afraid to create
just because it might

496
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:49,358
end up hurting someone.

497
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:51,400
Because if you were to do that,

498
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,942
it would be very dull
to coexist with you.

499
00:20:57,483 --> 00:20:59,108
To coexist?

500
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:00,733
[DOPPEL]
So for starters...

501
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:02,692
I took the liberty of looking
over the cybernetic

502
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:05,025
components that you
developed for your mother,

503
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:08,358
and found three things
you'll need to correct.

504
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:09,858
Your design will start well,

505
00:21:09,942 --> 00:21:12,525
but will develop some
problems in about ten years.

506
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:14,108
I'm far better at
running simulations

507
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:15,358
than you are, you know.

508
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,567
So first of all...

509
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,525
[MIKOTO]
Okay.

510
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:20,775
So then, the Doppelganger
basically came to you

511
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:22,025
in your dream?

512
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:22,983
[KURIBA]
Yeah.

513
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:24,858
It's the strangest thing.

514
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:27,358
I only swapped out
a portion of my organs.

515
00:21:27,442 --> 00:21:30,608
That kind of phenomenon really
shouldn't be happening.

516
00:21:30,692 --> 00:21:32,025
That is strange.

517
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:33,525
[KURIBA] At first I thought it
was it was my own guilt

518
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:35,692
causing me to hallucinate
or have the same dream

519
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:37,400
night after night, but...

520
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:41,775
Yeah that pretty much
sounds exactly like

521
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:43,900
what she could do
when I fought against her.

522
00:21:43,983 --> 00:21:46,650
[KURIBA] Uh-huh. And what's
more, she went on and on

523
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:48,650
finding fault with a lot
of the past research

524
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:50,942
I've done.

525
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:54,942
So, how can we help you cross
over to the other side?

526
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:57,650
[DOPPEL] I have no soul,
so I can't cross over.

527
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,483
Now that I've explained
your errors in detail,

528
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,442
next we'll go over
your dark past.

529
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:03,608
--There's quite a lot to unpack.
--[KURIBA] No, no, no!

530
00:22:03,692 --> 00:22:06,150
To be honest,
I'm afraid to go to sleep.

531
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:09,567
Well, even so.

532
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:12,192
[MIKOTO]
That's kind of a relief.

533
00:22:16,108 --> 00:22:18,567
[KURIBA]
I'm sorry.

534
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,858
I sort of ended up dumping
all of my responsibilities

535
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:23,650
onto you, huh?

536
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:27,192
And, maybe, it's not really
my place to relay

537
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:29,775
this to you, but I'm going to.

538
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:31,483
Throughout all of the
time that Doppelganger

539
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:34,692
was operational,

540
00:22:34,775 --> 00:22:36,983
she only seemed truly fulfilled
during her battle

541
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:38,400
with you.

542
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:44,108
[MIKOTO] Well, if you
happen to run into her

543
00:22:44,192 --> 00:22:46,483
in another one of
your dreams soon,

544
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,608
tell her she wasn't
so bad herself.

545
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,067
Oh, there you are, Sissy.

546
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,150
You kept us waiting.

547
00:22:54,233 --> 00:22:55,358
So I was thinking.

548
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:56,817
Since we're all around,
why don't we go out

549
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,108
and get something good to eat?

550
00:22:58,192 --> 00:22:59,400
Oh! I know a place.

551
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:01,067
There's a café around here
from an urban legend

552
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,525
that I've been dying
to check out!

553
00:23:02,608 --> 00:23:03,942
Excuse me, Saten?

554
00:23:04,025 --> 00:23:05,525
[UIHARU]
Man, you never learn, do you?

555
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:07,025
[SATEN]
What? I was just kidding.

556
00:23:07,108 --> 00:23:08,108
[KUROKO]
No you weren't!

557
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:09,608
You're always like this.

558
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:11,983
[MIKOTO] Anywhere's fine,
as long as we're all together.

559
00:23:16,692 --> 00:23:18,483
[MIKOTO]
Okay, let's go!
