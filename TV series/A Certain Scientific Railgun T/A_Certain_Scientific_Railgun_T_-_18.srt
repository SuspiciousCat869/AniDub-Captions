[SATEN grunts]

2
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:55,942
[MIKOTO]
Ah!

3
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:58,317
Pretty sweet, right?
I'm a <i>kendama</i> pro.

4
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,858
Yeah, you're not kidding.

5
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:02,275
And you said you mastered
all that in one night?

6
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:04,108
[SATEN] Yep.
Anyone can with the right card.

7
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:06,317
All they gotta do
is choose and snooze.

8
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,608
It's crazy you can
learn while you sleep.

9
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:10,358
I had no idea you
could use Indian Poker

10
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:11,858
for something like that.

11
00:01:11,942 --> 00:01:13,817
One person learned
a foreign language.

12
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,900
They just used a dream
of someone fluent.

13
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:17,317
And then there's
that one bowler.

14
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,775
They're a powerhouse
because of the skills

15
00:01:18,858 --> 00:01:21,442
they learned from the
dream of a professional.

16
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:26,150
So next, I'm learning
pen-spinning tech.

17
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:28,983
[MIKOTO] Clearly she has a
preference for parlor tricks.

18
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:30,608
So what does that mean?

19
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:32,692
You know people who are
expert <i>kendama</i> players

20
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:33,858
and pen spinners?

21
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:35,775
[SATEN] Nah. I get them
through a Trader.

22
00:01:35,858 --> 00:01:36,900
[MIKOTO]
A Trader?

23
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:38,233
In the early days,
all people could do

24
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:40,400
was trade cards
amongst their friends.

25
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:43,067
But that inevitably got
pretty boring after a while.

26
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,650
So lately, some
people have decided

27
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:45,942
to become Traders.

28
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:47,733
They'll have loads of cards
that are separated

29
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,900
into different ranks.

30
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:51,900
Which is good news for
your average consumer,

31
00:01:51,983 --> 00:01:53,650
'cause you can generally
get the most popular

32
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:56,650
S and A-Rank cards
from a Trader now.

33
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:59,358
They usually accept trades of
a bunch of lower rank cards.

34
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:01,400
Or you can just pay
for them outright.

35
00:02:01,483 --> 00:02:03,775
I ended up trading
for this one myself.

36
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,358
[MIKOTO]
Sounds familiar. Ugh.

37
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:09,067
[BOYS]
Blau! Blau! Blau! Blau!

38
00:02:12,317 --> 00:02:14,192
[MIKOTO] I really hope those
kinds of cards haven't been

39
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:15,692
going around too much.

40
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,775
[MUGINO] Ah!
I can finally take a shower.

41
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,025
You can wipe blood away,

42
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:57,608
but the smell always
lingers in your hair.

43
00:03:57,692 --> 00:03:59,567
[KINUHATA] Maybe if you
used your ability instead of

44
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,025
ultra-pummeling them.

45
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,067
[MUGINO] Yeah well, that target
today was kind of a pain

46
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,567
in the ass, right?

47
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,275
A quick Meltdowner blast
wouldn't have let me

48
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:07,608
vent my frustrations.

49
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:09,608
I'd probably still be pent up.

50
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:10,900
Takitsubo!

51
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:12,983
Would you mind grabbing me
the Cybele number 5?

52
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:14,025
[TAKITSUBO]
Hm?

53
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:20,567
[TAKITSUBO]
The one with the orange label?

54
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,817
[MUGINO]
That's the one.

55
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,942
[TAKITSUBO]
Here.

56
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:23,983
[MUGINO]
Thanks!

57
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:29,275
[KINUHATA] Mugino and
Takitsubo are both sporting

58
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:32,275
some prime quality goods.

59
00:04:32,358 --> 00:04:35,192
But taking my age and
height into consideration,

60
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,025
my figure is ideal!

61
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:40,567
Some may even venture to call it
the ultra-perfect body-type!

62
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,358
Besides, I'm not at the bottom.

63
00:04:42,442 --> 00:04:43,567
That'd be Frenda.

64
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,692
[KINUHATA] Frenda, has your body
ultra-developed recently?

65
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:55,858
Huh? Uh, yeah,
I guess a little bit.

66
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:58,358
Maybe it's 'cause my little
sister's been rubbing them.

67
00:04:58,442 --> 00:04:59,942
My bras have been
feeling tighter,

68
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:02,067
and I keep having to buy
new ones lately.

69
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,650
There are so many other
things I'd rather

70
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:05,567
be spending my money on,
but nope!

71
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,692
It's seriously becoming
a big problem!

72
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,275
Hey, I'm back.

73
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:11,650
Took you long enough.

74
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:14,317
[HAMAZURA] Ugh. Why do I
have to be an errand boy?

75
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,400
[MUGINO] Quit your griping
and hand it over already.

76
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,817
[HAMAZURA]
Here. Banana tea.

77
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,150
Awesome, thank you.

78
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:23,650
[HAMAZURA]
Black bean cider.

79
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:24,900
[FRENDA]
Thank you!

80
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:27,358
Oh. You weren't here to
tell me what you wanted,

81
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:29,858
so I grabbed you
a bunch, Kinuhata.

82
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:33,733
Pomegranate cola, guarana green
juice, and Musashino milk.

[COW moos]

84
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:36,525
Interesting choices.

85
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:39,608
Was there a particular reason
you picked out milk?

86
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:41,150
[HAMAZURA] Well, drinking
milk is supposed to be good

87
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:42,233
for growing kids.

88
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:46,567
[HAMAZURA yells]
Whoa! The hell was that for?

89
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,567
[KINUHATA] Hey! I didn't say
you were allowed to dodge me!

90
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,067
[MUGINO]
Don't kill him please.

91
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,692
Re-staffing our subsidiary
organizations is a real pain.

92
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:55,817
[HAMAZURA yells]

93
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,442
[KINUHATA]
This is ultra-aggravating.

94
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,108
Hey there.
Care to take a look?

95
00:06:08,192 --> 00:06:10,733
I guess. Indian Poker, huh?

96
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:12,692
I am in a sour mood.

97
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:14,900
Maybe it'll help me alleviate
some of my stress.

98
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:22,483
[KINUHATA]
I don't know what to choose.

99
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:25,900
[GIRL A] I'll take this one,
that one, and that one.

100
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:28,233
[M TRADER A]
Okay, three C-Ranks.

101
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:29,317
Thank you!

102
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,650
[GIRL A]
Thank you, too!

103
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:32,900
[MIKOTO]
Oh.

104
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:34,483
That must be one of
those Traders Saten was

105
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:36,775
telling me about.

106
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:38,650
[M TRADER A]
So, nothing catch your eye?

107
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:41,442
I dunno. I'm ultra-lost here.

108
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:42,858
[M TRADER A]
I recommend this one.

109
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:44,983
It was created by
a Portuguese teacher.

110
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:47,608
Use this and you'll be
conversational by morning.

111
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:49,150
No thanks.

112
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:51,817
I'm not really interested in
the knowledge or skill types.

113
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,358
I'm looking for one where
I can experience

114
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:55,108
an ultra-good story.

115
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:57,942
And not an A-Rank one
made for amateurs, either.

116
00:06:58,025 --> 00:06:59,442
I want an ultra-clever one.

117
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:02,858
Like a C-Rank or below,
with lots of personality.

118
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:04,275
Huh.

119
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,650
Well, different strokes for
different folks and all.

120
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:07,817
How 'bout you?

121
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,483
[MIKOTO]
Oh. I think I'll pass.

122
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,192
I've had an ultra-bad time
with these things.

123
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:15,567
Uh, hi.
Can I help you with something?

124
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,775
You're fine.

125
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:18,150
Railgun.

126
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:20,358
If Mugino were here, there'd be
an ultra-bloodbath,

127
00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:21,567
but I have the day off.

128
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,692
Everything's fine.

129
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,108
Ho! Sounds like you got
unlucky and drew

130
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:26,775
a dud of a card, huh?

131
00:07:26,858 --> 00:07:28,275
That's rough.

132
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:29,942
But don't give up on your
dreams 'cause of one failure!

133
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:32,317
You don't want to live a boring,
aimless life, right?

134
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,108
[MIKOTO]
I didn't ask for your opinion.

135
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,775
I noticed you don't have
any S-Rank cards on display.

136
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,025
Nah. Gotta keep
those close to me.

137
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:44,400
Plus, all I have right
now is this one.

138
00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:46,692
It's not anything
perverted, is it?

139
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:48,150
You really think
I could deal those out

140
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,900
in the open like this?

141
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:51,108
If that's what
you're lookin' for,

142
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:52,692
head to the back alley.

143
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:54,942
Did it sound like
I was looking for one?

144
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:56,983
[M TRADER A]
Well, there's always this, then.

145
00:07:57,067 --> 00:08:00,108
There's an interesting story
behind it, let me tell you.

146
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:02,858
The dream on this card
is of a brilliant scientist

147
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:04,400
who suddenly vanished.

148
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,358
Apparently he was
quite the whack job,

149
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,025
even by this city's standards.

150
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:10,692
And his final research
theme was aptly titled

151
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:11,983
the "Bust Upper."

152
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:15,442
There's a chance that the
essence of it is infused

153
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:17,692
within the very card
I hold in my hand.

154
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:19,108
Now, whether you
actually believe it or not

155
00:08:19,192 --> 00:08:20,317
is up to--

156
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:32,400
[HAMAZURA] Well, drinking
milk is supposed to be good

157
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:33,983
for growing kids.

[KINUHATA] It's ultra-easy to
beat a whipped subordinate

into shutting up.

161
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,442
But in this case, resorting
to violence feels like

162
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:43,358
admitting he's right.

163
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:44,858
If I'm going to knock
that stupid jerk

164
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:47,067
down a peg and
get him to respect me...

165
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:49,192
Excuse me.

166
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:52,442
I'm sorry, but I had my
hand on this card first.

167
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:55,275
Don't give me that; my hands
were ultra-quick to grab it.

168
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:57,317
[MIKOTO] Unless my ears
were deceiving me,

169

I seem to recall you saying
you weren't interested

in knowledge and skill types.

171
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:02,817
For someone who had
an ultra-bad time

172
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,775
with a card and was
acting above it all,

173
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:07,400
you sure are changing your
tune all of a sudden, huh?

174
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:08,442
How strange.

175
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,900
Get your mitts off
this card already,

176
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:13,317
you dirty little runt.

179
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:21,233
[MIKOTO] She's got spirit,
I'll give her that.

180
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:23,233
[KINUHATA] She doesn't know me,
and at this range,

181

I've got the upper hand.

182
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:26,025
This'll be ultra-easy.

Whoa! Hold on a sec!

184
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,775
If the film gets peeled off,
it'll become unstable!

185

And then nobody will
be able to use it!

[M TRADER A]
Ow...

187

I don't know which one
is which anymore!

191
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:51,483
I think the S-Rank
was silver-colored.

192
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:54,150
Well first off, there's a bunch
of other silver ones.

00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:56,525
[M TRADER A]
Ugh! Now what do I do?

194
00:09:58,358 --> 00:10:01,775
How about this?
I'll take your whole stock.

195
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:04,317
Uh, I guess that's fine,
if you're really okay with it.

196
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,858
[KINUHATA]
No. I'll pay for half of it.

197

[M TRADER A]
Huh?

198

[M TRADER A]
Thank you.

199
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:22,442
[MIKOTO] After thinking
it through logically,

200
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:23,817
we both want the same thing.

201
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,275
The research within the card,
not the card itself.

202
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:28,067
And whichever one
of us hits the jackpot

203
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,150
can easily just share what
they learn with the other,

204
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:31,983
so there's no reason
for us to fight.

205
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:34,442
[KINUHATA] Yeah, butting heads
would be ultra-stupid.

206
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:36,775
Besides, we've got a lot
of cards to go through,

207
00:10:36,858 --> 00:10:38,358
so if we both work on it...

208
00:10:38,442 --> 00:10:39,483
[MIKOTO]
...we'll cut the time...

209
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:40,733
[KINUHATA]
...in half.

210
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:43,233
Us kindred spirits have
got to work together.

211
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:45,275
Let's hope for some
ultra-good luck.

212
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,358
[MIKOTO (YOSHIKAWA)] According
to the monthly measurements

213
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:55,400
of "my" body,

214
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:57,442
there was no change
in chest size at all

215
00:10:57,525 --> 00:10:59,650
in the latter teen years!

216
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:01,567
And yet my classmate's
development has been

217
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,483
so extreme, her chest
might as well be

218
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:04,775
her true form!

219
00:11:04,858 --> 00:11:06,858
No. Let's look
at this differently.

220
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:08,525
If there's no change
in my measurements,

221
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:10,608
all it means is that I'm
successfully holding on

222
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:12,275
to my youth.

223
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:14,858
There's still plenty
of time for a growth spurt.

224
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:18,317
My waist grew three centimeters?

225
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,317
[MIKOTO gasps]
No!

226
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,858
I can't keep hoping
I'll grow eventually.

227
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:25,067
Once I hit that age,
it's game over.

228
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,317
I gotta keep trying.

229
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:32,358
[KINUHATA]
Hm? What's this? A maid?

230
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,775
But this is an ultra-plain
looking room.

231
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:36,942
Why would they hire a maid?

232
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:38,483
Looks like a dorm room--

233
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:39,400
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Bam!

234
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:40,858
A pervert!

[TSUCHIMIKADO] My super-rare
petite-sized Leviathan Bra

Maid top has finally
arrived from London!

237
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,817
With this on,
you'll look just like

238
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,567
a fallen angel maid!

239
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,025
Even if you don't have
an hourglass figure.

240
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:51,608
If you don't get
that disgusting thing

241
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:54,900
out of my sight now,
you're ultra-dead.

242
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:56,233
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Whoa-ho-ho!

243
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,525
Your refusal today is even
more extreme than usual!

244
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:00,025
However...

245
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:01,233
From the bottom of my heart,

246
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:03,067
I truly believe no one
in Academy City

247
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,025
would look more beautiful
in this crude outfit

248
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:06,275
than you.

249
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,650
If nothing else, I want
you to understand that.

250
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:12,608
[KINUHATA] This guy's
crazy, and not to mention dumb,

251
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:14,275
but his heart is sincere.

252
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,858
And deep down,
the owner of this dream

253
00:12:15,942 --> 00:12:18,025
isn't against that.

254
00:12:18,108 --> 00:12:19,900
It doesn't matter
what the world thinks.

255
00:12:19,983 --> 00:12:22,317
As long as the man
I adore accepts me.

256
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,192
Then it doesn't matter
what my body is like.

257
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:27,900
That's what this
dream is saying.

258
00:12:27,983 --> 00:12:30,692
And if you don't like that one,
I also have this maid swim--

259

Too bad my patience
is ultra-short

No, her body language is

and shoes well-worn
from walking.

There's a business
card in her pocket.

You are a woman of

However, I am still a student.

00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:04,858
However, feigning
bashfulness is permissible."

314
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:06,692
Ha! What's that
supposed to mean?

315
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:08,233
Girls who are well-endowed
don't have any shame

316
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:09,442
to begin with!

317
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:10,692
"My shoulders are stiff."

318
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:12,192
"Ooh, I don't have
any cute bras."

319
00:15:12,275 --> 00:15:13,775
All they do is humblebrag!

320
00:15:13,858 --> 00:15:15,233
[M NARRATOR A] "But there are
also shinobi who are not blessed

321
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:16,358
in the chest."

322
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:17,692
[KINUHATA]
Nobody asked you!

323
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:19,525
[M NARRATOR A] "For you,
there is always your legs!

324
00:15:19,608 --> 00:15:21,733
Men can also be charmed
with the lower body.

325
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:23,525
Go ahead and show
off your inner thighs

326
00:15:23,608 --> 00:15:25,275
to incite their lust."

327
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,483
I'm shocked!

328
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,275
This scroll actually
has some useful info.

329
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:29,817
[M NARRATOR A] "Though boobs
are in far greater demand.

330
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,775
You'll never beat them. Sorry."

331
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:33,192
[KINUHATA]
Oh, just shut up!

332
00:15:33,275 --> 00:15:35,025
All I need to make
a man fall in line

333
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:36,275
are my two fists!

334
00:15:36,358 --> 00:15:37,983
If you like big lumps
of fat that much,

335
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:40,108
you can eat fatty foods
for the rest of your life

336
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:44,525
and slowly die from gout,
you ultra dumbasses!

337
00:15:44,608 --> 00:15:46,442
Excuse me, you're bothering
the other guests here.

338
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:48,983
Could you keep it down?

339
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:50,317
[KINUHATA]
I'm ultra-sorry.

340
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,650
[MIKOTO] I just so happen
to be a telekinetic as well.

341
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,983
It seems I'm significantly
more skilled at it--

342
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:07,858
I wish I could stop
thinking about that.

343
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:10,150
I was acting all smug
and ate my words.

344
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:11,942
So embarrassing.

345
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:15,067
[KOBAYASHI]
Are you still feeling down?

346
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,983
[MIKOTO]
Kobayashi?

347
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:20,442
[KOBAYASHI] The Daihasei
Festival is all in the past.

348
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:22,608
Try to cheer up.

349
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:24,067
I messed up big-time too,

350
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,733
but it doesn't bother
me anymore.

351
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:28,317
[MIKOTO]
But...

352
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,650
[KOBAYASHI] Our Queen told me
something that struck a chord

353
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:31,108
with me.

354
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:33,817
That feeling down is a waste
of our brain's resources.

355
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,900
So, come on,
shoulders back, chest out!

356
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:38,858
[MIKOTO] Yeah, well,
that might be good advice

357
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:42,400
for someone like you, Kobayashi,
but with my chest like this,

358
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:44,567
there's no point
in sticking it out.

359
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,275
Okay, that's enough!

360
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:48,525
If you think you can't be
confident at your size,

361
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,608
then what about all
the other smaller girls?

362
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:51,983
Have you ever thought
how those of us

363
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:53,608
who barely have a chest feel?

364
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:55,108
Get over yourself!

365
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,858
[M EMPLOYEE A]
Could you two leave now?

366
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:01,942
[KINUHATA]
Yeah.

367
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:06,942
Ugh. There're still some cards
we haven't gotten to check.

368
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,483
What do you want
to do about them?

369
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:13,858
Hmm. We could try this hotel
I know that's around the corner.

370
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:16,608
I really do apologize,
but unfortunately,

371
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:18,775
because of renovations,
our regular rooms

372
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:21,733
are closed for about a week.

373
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:24,025
[MIKOTO]
Well, there's the dorm,

374
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:25,483
but I'd need to jump
through hoops to get them

375
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:28,525
to allow a visitor
anywhere near it.

376
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:30,483
[KINUHATA] It's not like I can
realistically bring her back

377
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:31,983
to our hideout.

378
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:34,358
Plus, if Mugino saw me
hanging around Railgun,

379
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:35,858
things would get ultra-messy.

380
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,858
There's the outdoor lounge,
if it's still open.

381
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,567
[MIKOTO]
It is nice and warm out today.

382
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,733
Yeah, I think this'll
work ultra-fine.

383
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:12,942
Huh?

384
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,900
Okay, now this is different.

385
00:18:14,983 --> 00:18:17,400
I usually turn into
somebody else.

386
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:20,733
Recall the moments you've
dreamt of a brighter future.

387
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:22,567
Wouldn't you say these
are also the times

388
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,442
when you're filled
with the most hope?

389
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:26,775
I guess?

390
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:29,775
Take, for example,
a woman's chest size.

391
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,692
Any girl would want
to grow into a body type

392
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:33,108
that people admire.

393
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:35,817
That much goes without saying,
but the rate of growth

394
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,858
and the pure excitement
you feel as you gradually

395
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:40,275
transform into
your ideal figure.

396
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:43,442
That period of optimism
and anticipation

397
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:46,942
is the sweetest moment
of your whole life.

398
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,192
However, we're faced
with numerous obstacles

399
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:51,525
over the course of our lives.

400
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:53,233
They throw a wet blanket
over our hopes

401
00:18:53,317 --> 00:18:55,483
for the future.

402
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:59,900
For instance, a threat
you cannot ignore.

403
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:02,067
But then, by removing
such a threat,

404
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,983
one may inadvertently
bring out yet another,

405
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:07,358
even greater threat.

406
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:09,817
If that happened,
what would you do?

407
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,025
[MIKOTO]
That was a weird dream.

408
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:34,733
[SPHINX meows]

409
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:49,400
We went through
every single one,

410
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:51,817
and the Bust Upper was
nowhere to be found.

411
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,025
That trader.

412
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,983
The next time I see him,
I'll ultra-kill him!

413
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,358
[MIKOTO] I should have trusted
my gut from the get-go.

414
00:19:57,442 --> 00:20:00,400
A card like that is way
too specific to really exist.

415
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:02,358
[KINUHATA] It's nothing
but an urban legend.

416
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:04,275
And a baseless one, too.

417
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:06,358
[MIKOTO] And the researcher
mysteriously vanished?

418
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:07,733
Not suspicious at all!

419
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:09,108
[KINUHATA]
Even for a made-up story,

420
00:20:09,192 --> 00:20:11,192
the guy clearly didn't
put much effort into it.

421
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,400
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

422
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:32,608
How was I supposed to know
you hated milk so much?

423
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:36,817
I just figured it's the go-to
when you wanna get taller.

424
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,942
Get taller?

425
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:40,442
Uh, yeah.
Don't you remember?

426
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:42,608
That time I made you
a fake student ID?

427
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:45,567
We wanted to get you into
that R-rated movie.

428
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,692
The lady behind the counter
was totally onto us,

429
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:49,400
but she let us through.

430
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:53,150
I wish I was taller.
Life would be so much easier.

431
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:54,525
Y'get me?

432
00:20:54,608 --> 00:20:56,608
So when I saw some milk,
I thought you might want it.

433
00:20:56,692 --> 00:20:58,817
[HAMAZURA yells]

434
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,608
[HAMAZURA] Hey! Wh--
What did you do that for?

435
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:04,483
[KINUHATA]
That was ultra-misleading!

436
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:06,358
[MIKOTO] So anyway, there
was this girl who kept going

437
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,067
"ultra" this and "ultra" that.

438
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,192
We kinda got off on
the wrong foot at first,

439
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:11,483
but after we talked for a bit,

440
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:14,275
I realized she was a
surprisingly good person.

441
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,442
Very interesting,
but don't you think it's time

442
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,067
we went to bed?

443
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,775
I slept pretty
much the entire day,

444
00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:21,858
so I'm wide awake.

445
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:23,442
Oh, speaking of...

446
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:25,317
Let me tell you about
this one dream.

447
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,692
There was this street
performer girl,

448
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:28,317
and we spoke for a bit.

449
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,567
Her figure was like mine,

450
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,983
but she was wearing
this revealing outfit.

451
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:34,650
And she was so confident in it.

452
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,025
[KUROKO]
I'm so tired.

453
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:38,233
Sissy.

454
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:39,858
I know I'm always saying
how I'd love for you

455
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:41,233
and I to spend
the night together,

456
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:46,233
but I must confess, this is
not the way I meant it.

457
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:53,150
Check it. Pretty impressive,
don't ya think?

458
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:55,817
[UIHARU] Wow, you really
got that good overnight?

459
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,858
Sure did! This just
gets better by the day!

460
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,108
For my next one, I'm lookin'
for a card master.

461
00:22:01,192 --> 00:22:03,483
I wanna build the
best house of cards!

462
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:05,733
A house of cards this time, huh?

463
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:07,692
That'll fit right in with all
the other useless skills

464
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:08,942
you've learned.

465
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:10,858
But hey, do what
makes you happy.

466
00:22:10,942 --> 00:22:12,108
Aww...

467
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:14,192
I wish nighttime would
get here already.

468
00:22:20,275 --> 00:22:21,817
Did you see that? Look at her!

469
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,608
Her boobs are gigantic!

470
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:25,858
[UIHARU] Hey! You can't
just say that, Saten!

471
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:27,150
[SATEN]
Oh, what's the harm?

472
00:23:58,233 --> 00:23:59,567
[KINUHATA]
Well that was, overall,

473
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,567
an ultra-awful experience.

474
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,983
So, what are you up to, Frenda?

475
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,067
[FRENDA] Just texting
with someone. A friend.

476
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,108
[MUGINO]
Let's see.

477
00:24:06,192 --> 00:24:07,483
"I got pounded on
by my associate.

478
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:10,358
She has gorilla power."
Now who might that be about?

479
00:24:10,442 --> 00:24:11,817
[FRENDA]
Uh, definitely not anyone here!
