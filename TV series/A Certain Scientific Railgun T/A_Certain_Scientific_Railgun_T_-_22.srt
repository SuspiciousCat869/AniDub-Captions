1
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,067
[NARU] Yeah, I'm just saying,
I wanna forget

2
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,108
all about our screw-up as
soon as humanly possible.

3
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:40,442
No duh, we all do.

4
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:42,775
That's why we're doing
this job to make up for it.

5
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:44,108
[NARU]
Yeah I guess.

6
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:46,025
But to actually fix our rep
we gotta go bigger!

7
00:00:46,108 --> 00:00:48,317
We need a job where
we can strut our stuff!

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,067
Then maybe we can
snag us that cool

9
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,733
team name I've been hoping for!

10
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:54,442
By team name,
do you mean something like

11
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:55,733
ITEM or SCHOOL?

12
00:00:55,817 --> 00:00:57,900
Uh-huh!
How does HYENA sound to you?

13
00:00:57,983 --> 00:00:59,775
Like we're grody dogs.

14
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:02,192
[SEIKE] Can you even choose
your own team name?

15
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:03,233
[LEADER]
Quiet.

16
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,900
[SEIKE]
The puppet isn't here.

17
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,400
It's your fault for making
us get popsicles.

18
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:12,192
Why are you blaming me?
Everyone bought them!

19
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:13,817
[LEADER]
It's not a problem.

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,650
No mere puppet can
escape from the eyes

21
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:17,192
of my Predator.

22
00:02:57,942 --> 00:03:00,442
[MIKOTO] Tell us about the
dangers this thing poses.

23
00:03:00,525 --> 00:03:02,442
[KURIBA]
Okay, but to be precise,

24
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:05,525
it's the dangers her soul pose
that are concerning.

25
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:06,775
What about it?

26
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:08,525
Miss Ryoko Kuriba.

27
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:10,358
Do you, a scientist,
really believe in

28
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:13,067
such a spiritual thing?

29
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,525
Regardless of how I feel,

30
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:15,900
it's thought that
what we call a soul

31
00:03:15,983 --> 00:03:17,567
is tied to the body.

32
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,358
When the body
ceases to function,

33
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:20,858
the soul vanishes with it.

34
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:24,483
But if a soul is inside
the mechanical body

35
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:26,817
of the Doppelganger,
it was only placed there,

36
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,692
and temporarily at that.

37
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:31,983
Even if the vessel is broken,

38
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:35,608
it doesn't go away;
it just becomes untethered.

39
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:37,275
An untethered soul
will spread out

40
00:03:37,358 --> 00:03:39,692
from the vessel
into its surroundings.

41
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:42,108
This ordinarily impossible
"free soul" could then

42
00:03:42,192 --> 00:03:46,775
possess any material
and control it as it pleases.

43
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:48,358
In the worst-case scenario,

44
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:50,025
I'm afraid it might
be able to swallow up

45
00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:53,733
Academy City itself
and take control of everything.

46
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,233
[MIKOTO] I'm having trouble
imagining what that

47
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:56,525
would even be like.

48
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:59,025
Essentially, we should
avoid breaking the vessel

49
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:01,650
the soul resides in,
otherwise we risk exposing

50
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:04,608
the entire city to a
potentially greater threat.

51
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:06,900
Have you told this to
the people at the lab?

52
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:08,900
Yes, I have,
but they're so caught up

53
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,775
in the success
of their research,

54
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:13,317
they refused to imagine
any consequences.

55
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,525
[SHORT-HAIRED WOMAN]
Question.

56
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:16,442
So if the Doppelganger
decided to hurt itself,

57
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:18,067
we'd just be out of luck, right?

58
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,275
It's not like we
could do anything.

59
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:22,442
[KURIBA]
That probably won't happen.

60
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:24,983
No, I should say
it can't happen.

61
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:26,650
That artificial body started out

62
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,192
as two separates halves
of two cyborgs.

63
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:31,942
There's a self-preservation
function built into it.

64
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:33,983
When it functioned
as prosthetics,

65
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,025
allowing itself to shut
down would directly

66
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:38,275
endanger the wearer's life.

67
00:04:38,358 --> 00:04:41,108
As a result, it's programmed
not to perform any action

68
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:43,358
that would cause more than
a specified degree of damage

69
00:04:43,442 --> 00:04:44,567
to itself.

70
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:50,192
That safety measure
was your doing?

71
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:51,400
It was.

72
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:53,192
Artificial muscles that
contract in response

73
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:54,900
to chemical interaction,

74
00:04:54,983 --> 00:04:57,358
immunosuppressive agents
that inhibit the body's

75
00:04:57,442 --> 00:04:59,317
rejection of flesh bonding.

76
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,983
The Doppelganger
uses a lot of tech

77
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,567
that I personally developed.

78
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,400
And the reason you
spread Indian Poker

79
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:07,025
everywhere has
something to do with

80
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:10,150
the Doppelganger, too?

81
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:11,733
What would make you think that?

82
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:13,067
Because the time when
you learned about

83
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,483
the Doppelganger's
existence overlaps

84
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:17,983
with when those cards
started going around.

85
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,358
Why wouldn't I assume
that the two are

86
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:20,567
connected somehow?

87
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:24,067
Well, you're not wrong.

88
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,150
Indian Poker allows
someone else to acquire

89
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:30,567
a person's experiences and
skills through their dreams.

90
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,567
And we advance as
a society by sharing

91
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,483
our experiences with each other.

92
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,358
So by creating a
streamlined avenue

93
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:38,192
with which to do so,
it should inspire

94
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:40,067
quicker growth.

95
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,525
While I might not
be able to solve

96
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,358
the Doppelganger situation,

97
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:45,150
someone interacting
with my ideas through

98
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:47,108
those cards might.

99
00:05:47,192 --> 00:05:49,192
With a fad that boosts
my number of collaborators,

100
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:51,608
it becomes a matter
of probability.

101
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,400
Maybe you think it's kind
of an indirect way

102
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:55,900
of fixing this, but since
I had to do it alone,

103
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:58,358
it was the best option
I could come up with.

104
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,983
I don't care how it
looks to anyone else.

105
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:03,192
Now excuse me, but I have to go.

106
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:05,983
You interrupted me
in the middle of my work.

107
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:09,483
I'll make sure to do something
about the Doppelganger.

108
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:11,150
You don't need to get involved.

109
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:16,900
[SHOKUHO] You don't seem
to like her very much.

110
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:18,400
Judging by that face.

111
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:20,608
I dunno, I get that
this girl is just a victim

112
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:23,025
in this weird situation,
and as a third party,

113
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:25,150
I don't have enough insight
to judge her honest

114
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:26,650
attempt at fixing
the whole mess...

115
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:28,025
By the way,
you're free to go now.

116
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:29,483
...but I don't care if
it was too much for her

117
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:30,817
to handle alone.

118
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,067
She used Indian Poker
to rope a bunch of

119
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,567
innocent people into her
dangerous problems.

120
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,692
Y'know?

121
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,150
It just kinda bothers me,
that's all.

122
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:39,775
Well, everyone
has their reasons.

123
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:46,650
[KURIBA]
Mikoto Misaka.

124
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,567
Maybe I should have
partnered up with her.

125
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:52,067
No.

126
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,733
I doubt anyone at
the lab will do anything

127
00:06:53,817 --> 00:06:56,942
as idiotic as destroying
the Doppelganger.

128
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:59,400
I shouldn't jump
head-first into this.

129
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:02,233
Give it some time
and it'll sort itself out.

[DOPPEL] Miahilin, used for the
aftereffects of cybernetics.

131
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:09,067
Easy to obtain,
but there aren't many people

132
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,233
who order the
high-quality version.

133
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:13,608
I just had to access the
pharmaceutical company's

134
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:14,942
database,

135
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:17,483
and then narrowing it down
from there wasn't hard.

136
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,650
Are you kidding? The Doppel!

137
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:26,608
[DOPPEL]
You're slow.

138
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:29,775
You're like a shut-in.
You need exercise.

139
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:33,817
You look like you're overworked
and not sleeping well.

140
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,067
You need to make sure
you're eating right, too.

141
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,525
Maybe it's the medical
equipment talking,

142
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:42,025
but I can't help
but be concerned.

143
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:44,358
What are you after? Is it me?

144
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:46,900
Do you want to switch places
with me or something?

145
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:49,275
Or have you found
a way to drive my soul

146
00:07:49,358 --> 00:07:51,525
out of my body?

147
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:52,900
Good question.

148
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:55,817
But either way, you end
up no longer existing.

149
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,733
So what does it matter?

150
00:07:57,817 --> 00:08:00,525
[KURIBA] Sorry, but I'm
not ready for that yet.

151
00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:10,817
[DOPPEL] So she had a
contingency plan in place.

152
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,233
But the fact that it didn't hurt
me and just kept me in place

153
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:14,442
means--

154
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:19,483
[DOPPEL]
What was that?

155

00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:37,525
what happens?

161
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:44,733
Oh, crap!

162
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:45,983
Just kidding.

163
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:49,358
Nice one!

164
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:58,067
[YAKUMARU] Well? Just having
your limbs grabbed is one thing,

165
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,400
but when it's your whole body,

166
00:08:59,483 --> 00:09:01,275
it's harder to break
free and run, huh?

167
00:09:01,358 --> 00:09:02,608
Come on now!

168
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:04,275
If you just stand there,
the area of effect's gonna

169
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:05,483
get bigger!

Capture complete!

[SEIKE] That was a piece
of cake after all.

173
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:23,067
[LEADER] Seike, right before
we made contact,

174
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,400
there was a woman
who looked just like this.

175
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:28,567
It's not likely they switched
places, but it's possible.

176
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,233
Just to be safe,
go and check it out for me.

177
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:33,567
[SEIKE] There's such a thing
as "over-delegating."

178
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,650
But all right, I'll take
care of it for you.

179
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:39,317
[LEADER] Now. All that's
left is to take this thing

180
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,650
to the designated location.

181
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:43,025
Hmm.

182
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:45,358
You look quite a bit different
than in the report.

183
00:09:45,442 --> 00:09:47,358
Must've thought it
would be easier to blend in

184
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:48,983
on the streets like this.

185
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:51,650
Or maybe you're hoping
to become a real human.

186
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,108
Is that it?

187
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,733
But if you have to look at
your disguise all the time,

188
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:57,275
won't it just serve as
a reminder that you're

189
00:09:57,358 --> 00:09:59,400
really an object on the inside?

190
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,483
You poor thing.

191
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:03,733
[laughs]

192
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:04,942
I'm kidding.

193
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:06,442
Was the occult act too much?

194
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:07,775
Kinda melodramatic.

195
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,775
No way, I thought it was poetic!

[DOPPEL] As an artificial

For my own reference,
would you show me

00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,942
what reactions would be
correct in this situation?

202

Hey! What are you letting
up on her for, Naru?

I'm at full power!

Except my paper isn't listening
to me for some reason!

But why?!

206

[LEADER]
And, according to our specs,

207
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:34,525
she shouldn't be able

Let go.. of... her!

[yells]

217

[KURIBA] That artificial body
started out as two separates

halves of two cyborgs--
there's a self-preservation

function built into it.

220

As a result, it's programmed
not to perform

221
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,150
any action that
would cause more than

222

a specified degree
of damage to itself.

[SEIKE] Well, she's bleeding,
there's no way around that.

226
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,733
I guess it's safe
to assume she's human.

227
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:30,692
If the other three realize
she's an honor student,

228
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:33,358
they might just get
the urge to off her.

229
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,025
But since I've confirmed
what she is,

230
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:36,358
it should be fine to let her go.

What do you think
you're doing there?

Uh, just pickin' on some wimp.

What's it to you?

Who do you think you are?

Some kind of hero that arrives

00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,775
when a girl finds
herself in trouble?

237

[SEIKE]
Where'd you--?

238

What?

239
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:02,733
[MIKOTO]
Are you okay?

240
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:03,858
[KURIBA]
Why?

241
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:08,733
[KURIBA] When I was little,
I was involved in

242
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:11,317
a building collapse.

243
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,608
The only way that
I was able to survive

244
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,650
was by receiving a lung
transplant from my mother.

245
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:19,317
But after the procedure,
my already frail mother

246
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,150
was left in even worse
health than before.

247
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,567
So as I grew up,

248
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,067
I devoted myself
to Academy City.

249
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,025
I learned all about
cyborg technology

250
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:31,567
in order to someday
treat my mother.

251
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,608
After putting everything
I had into it,

252
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:36,317
and starting to see
some results,

253
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,775
my mother took a turn
for the worse.

254
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,108
Pulmonary edema and
an associated infection.

255
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:45,358
My mother's body was
nearing the breaking point.

256
00:12:45,442 --> 00:12:47,275
The doctor said that
administering drugs

257
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:50,358
could slow her
decline temporarily,

258
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:52,483
but after a year,
or two at the most,

259
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:56,358
we couldn't expect
it to keep working.

260
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,400
I would have to develop
cyborg parts for all

261
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:01,150
the affected areas
in her body.

262
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:04,775
But I was profoundly
short on data.

263
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:08,025
With the number of cyborg
treatment cases being so low,

264
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:10,067
I was extremely hard-pressed
to collect the data

265
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,108
for all the necessary regions.

266
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:16,067
I wasn't going
to make it in time.

267
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:19,358
[KURIBA]
Hey Chief?

268
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:21,775
What's the word on
that plan I proposed?

269
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:24,150
Oh, yeah. Right, that one.

270
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:26,525
It'd be such an
unprecedented experiment

271
00:13:26,608 --> 00:13:28,150
we wouldn't find any volunteers.

272
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:29,358
[KURIBA]
Then I'll do it.

273
00:13:32,192 --> 00:13:34,025
By dividing myself in half,

274
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:36,900
we would gather exhaustive
data on my whole body.

275
00:13:41,483 --> 00:13:44,358
And I would be both the
observer and the subject.

276
00:13:44,442 --> 00:13:46,733
In a way, one could call
it the most ideal

277
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:50,067
circumstance possible.

278
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,150
I'll save you.

279
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:54,525
[SHOKUHO] And that seems
to be the gist of it.

280
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:57,483
At least, as far
as I investigated.

281
00:13:57,567 --> 00:14:00,150
I don't get why she
wouldn't tell us about that.

282
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:01,817
Think about it
from her perspective.

283
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,567
We're just a couple
of strangers who lied

284
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,942
to get her attention.

285
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:07,067
She's smart to keep her
cards close to her chest.

286
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,817
I get that, but still!

287
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,817
Perhaps she feels
responsible for the creation

288
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,192
of the Doppelganger.

289
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:14,192
I mean, it was the direct
result of her relentless

290
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:15,608
pursuit to treat her mother.

291
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:18,442
So maybe she wants to
take care of it by herself.

292
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,275
And if I'm not mistaken,
that's a feeling

293
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:23,983
you aren't entirely
unfamiliar with.

294
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:26,192
Incidentally,
by Kuriba's calculations,

295
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:28,275
if Indian Poker keeps
spreading as far and wide

296
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:29,608
as it has been,

297
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:31,525
then statistically speaking,
in two more months,

298
00:14:31,608 --> 00:14:33,775
a method of destroying
the so-called soul

299
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:36,192
should surface.

300
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,025
So, until then...

301
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:39,275
[SHOKUHO]
Yes.

302
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:40,900
She was probably planning
to keep the secret

303
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:43,400
all to herself.

304
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,733
[MIKOTO]
All to... herself.

305
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:51,108
[KUROKO]
Yes?

306
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:52,608
[MIKOTO]
Kuroko, how are things there?

307
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,275
The head resident
was in a sour mood,

308
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:55,983
and I had an awful
time pulling the wool

309
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:58,483
over her eyes, but I managed.

310
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:00,400
There's no guarantee
she won't come knocking

311
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,108
again though, so I hope
you're on your way back.

312
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:04,733
Actually, it looks like
this is going to take

313
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,275
a little while longer.

314
00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:10,567
I think I'll be able make it
back before midnight, though.

315
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,150
[KUROKO] Very well, I'll come up
with something else, then.

316
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:15,733
This is turning into
quite the thankless job.

317
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:17,400
Look, I promise to
make it up to you

318
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,567
as soon as I can.

319
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,400
Ooh, do you really
mean that, Sissy?

320
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:22,067
Then how about we sleep
in the same bed--

321
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,942
[MIKOTO] Something
other than that. Later.

322
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,025
[KUROKO]
Ugh!

323
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:35,317
I'm sure this is a touchy
subject for you, Misaka.

324
00:15:37,192 --> 00:15:40,192
[SEIKE]
They're... an Electromaster?

325
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:41,692
Who is this?

326
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:42,942
[KURIBA]
I don't know.

327
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,483
I did just run into the
Doppelganger, though,

328
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:48,358
so I'm thinking the two
must be related.

329
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:51,192
Earlier, I think we might
have started off

330
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:52,817
on the wrong foot.

331
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,775
Sorry if I gave you attitude.

332
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:57,108
[MIKOTO]
I get it.

333
00:15:57,192 --> 00:15:59,650
You must have your reasons
for what you're doing.

334
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:01,108
But if there's anything
you can't handle

335
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:04,067
on your own, I'm here.

336
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,483
For example,
I'll take care of this.

337
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:12,067
I'm grateful.

338
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:14,817
[SEIKE]
All done?

339
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:19,483
For the record, I was finished
with Little Miss Patchwork

340
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:20,983
anyway,

341
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:24,650
now that I know for sure she
isn't the target I'm after.

342
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,317
But never mind her.

343
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,317
Are you and I gonna have
some fun together now?

344
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,900
Well, if you're not after her,

345
00:16:30,983 --> 00:16:33,025
there's no reason
for us to fight.

346
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:35,733
[SEIKE] What's wrong?
Don't hold back for my sake.

347
00:16:35,817 --> 00:16:37,025
I may not look like it,

348
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:39,567
but I'm rockin' the same
equipment as you.

349
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,775
Huh?

350
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:43,317
Or is a valiant hero
like yourself too afraid

351
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,525
to fight me?

352
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:47,942
I don't know where you're
getting "hero" from.

353
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:50,817
I just don't like picking on
people who are weaker than me.

354
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:54,192
[SEIKE]
Oh, yeah?

355
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,692
That's some pretty big talk.

356
00:16:57,775 --> 00:17:00,400
Guess I'll have to show
you what I'm made of!

357
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,067
[NARU]
Sorry.

358
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,108
I know we were told to
capture it in one piece.

359
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,442
[YAKUMARU]
No need to apologize.

360
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:10,942
If you hadn't done it,
I would've.

361
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:12,317
[LEADER]
It really hurts.

362
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,900
Don't worry, I'm on it.

363
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,483
I'll mix up a painkiller for you
right away, in just a second.

364
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:19,483
[metal creaks]

365
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:27,483
[YAKUMARU] Wait, if the hunk of
scrap metal is still up

366
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,858
and running, we can still
complete our mission!

367
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:31,358
[NARU]
Both of you, get back!

368
00:17:31,442 --> 00:17:33,692
Better to finish this thing off!

369
00:17:33,775 --> 00:17:36,150
I'm gonna cave that tin
can you call a head in,

370
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:38,483
right here and now!

371
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:39,900
[NARU gasps]

372
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:43,483
What? Why is my paper
protecting this stupid thing?

373
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,942
[NARU screams]

374
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,483
--What the--?
--How'd it--?

375
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:53,108
[LEADER]
It took away her paper!

376
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:54,233
[DOPPEL]
How mean.

377
00:17:54,317 --> 00:17:56,608
I made proper skin
and everything.

378
00:17:56,692 --> 00:18:00,858
Well, this is a bit unwieldy,
but it'll still move fine.

379
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:02,025
[NARU growls]

380
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:11,025
[SEIKE] Being able to freely
adjust frictional coefficients

381
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:13,858
like I can, the falling
beams can't hurt me.

382
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:16,567
Bullets and blades
wouldn't work either.

383
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,900
Sure, I might not be able to
deflect your electric shocks,

384
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:22,275
but the beams that are
so nicely scattered about

385
00:18:22,358 --> 00:18:24,442
will serve as grounding.

386
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:26,983
If the falling debris
crushes you, so be it.

387
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:28,942
But if you're lucky enough
to deflect all that,

388
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,692
I'll take you down directly.

389
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:33,067
Huh?

390
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,650
Why are the beams
flying this way?

391
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:36,900
[SEIKE]
Your ability.

392
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,442
You're a psychokinetic,
not an electromaster.

393
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:41,608
No, a magnetism manipulator?

394
00:18:41,692 --> 00:18:44,067
How can you control all that?

395
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,650
This isn't good.

396
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:48,858
I may not take any damage, but
my grounding is disappearing!

397
00:18:48,942 --> 00:18:49,983
No choice.

398
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:51,275
I've underestimated you!

399
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:54,567
It's going to cost me a finger,

400
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,650
but you won't have
time to dodge this.

401
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:58,150
Even if you shock
me unconscious,

402
00:18:58,233 --> 00:18:59,900
my momentum will still cut you!

403
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:03,858
[MIKOTO]
Look at that.

404
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,483
You're stronger than I thought.

405
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,025
[SEIKE] You're a girl?
Wait a sec, you're...

406
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,900
[NARU]
Hey, check this out!

407
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:14,983
It says I'll have a
super-successful week!

408
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:16,483
They still print horoscopes?

409
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,400
You think there's anybody
in a scientific city

410
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:20,317
like this who believes
in that stuff?

411
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,692
Me, for one.

412
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:23,317
Though to be fair, I didn't
believe in them either,

413
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,483
until just recently.

414
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:26,067
But hear me out,
it was totally accurate

415
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,650
the other week!

416
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,400
It said that the greatest
encounter of my life

417
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:30,900
would happen,

418
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:32,983
that I would have a terrible
failure at work as a result,

419
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,400
and I'd lose credibility!

420
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:36,567
My unlucky colors
were red and white!

421
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,692
Oh, man, that's about as
accurate as it could have been.

422
00:19:39,775 --> 00:19:41,233
[NARU]
Right? Listen to this week's!

423
00:19:41,317 --> 00:19:43,275
I'm supposed to meet
someone wonderful!

424
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:45,692
And that it might even help
turn things around at work!

425
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:47,650
Plus I need to be good
to my loved ones.

426
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:48,775
Not bad!

427
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,108
[LEADER] Well, horoscopes
notwithstanding,

428
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:55,108
we really did draw the short
straw on that last mission.

429
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:57,775
Of the 2.3 million people
in Academy City,

430
00:19:57,858 --> 00:20:00,275
only seven of them are Level 5s.

431
00:20:00,358 --> 00:20:01,525
We got unlucky.

432
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:03,275
Out of everyone
we could have run into,

433
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:04,775
it was one of seven.

434
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:07,358
But there's no way we'll fight
another one any time soon.

435
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:09,067
It's practically impossible.

436
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:12,858
[SEIKE]
The third-ranked Level 5.

437

Railgun.

438
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:16,233
That's the occult for you.

439
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:22,067
A bunch of bull.

440
00:20:24,983 --> 00:20:28,442
[MIKOTO] Well, that's certainly
not enough to kill you.

441
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:31,358
Then again, I can't ask you
any questions now, either.

442
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:41,525
That just leaves one of you
who's still able to move.

443
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:42,650
[YAKUMARU]
Naru!

444
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:43,733
What do I do?

445
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:45,150
I doubt I could carry
both of them,

446
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:47,525
let alone run away
while doing it!

447
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:48,775
Okay!

448
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:54,150
[DOPPEL] Oh, you're just going
to leave your friends here

449
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:55,358
and run?

450
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:00,233
[YAKUMARU] I can't destroy it,
it'll just repair itself

451
00:21:00,317 --> 00:21:03,067
with another substance like
it did with Naru's paper.

452
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,317
But... If I can freeze it...

453
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:11,150
All right!

454
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:12,775
[LEADER]
Yakumaru!

455
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:13,900
Wrong one.

456
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:18,900
Paper?

457
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:23,567
[DOPPEL]
That's for tricking me before.

458
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,108
This "hunk of scrap metal"
can create

459
00:21:25,192 --> 00:21:28,692
pretty convincing dummies,
wouldn't you say so?

460
00:21:28,775 --> 00:21:30,442
[YAKUMARU gasps]
No!

461
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:39,650
[NARU]
Give that back.

462
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,317
I'm gonna catch a cold out here!

463
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:44,233
Yakku!

464
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:52,900
[DOPPEL] I was originally
planning to let them return

465
00:21:52,983 --> 00:21:57,358
alive, so they could
give a full report.

466
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,192
But perhaps it's necessary
to show them

467
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:01,692
just how powerful I can be.

468
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:07,650
[YAKUMARU] We should be okay,
now that we've made it this far.

469
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:09,067
[LEADER]
You saved us, Naru.

470
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,233
[NARU chuckles]
I am Scavenger's ace.

471
00:22:12,317 --> 00:22:14,525
No need to thank me for
doing what comes natural.

472
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:16,942
What are we supposed
to do now, Leader?

473
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:18,733
[LEADER]
First we meet up with Seike,

474
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:20,608
who should really
be back by now.

475
00:22:20,692 --> 00:22:22,650
[MIKOTO]
The one in the sailor uniform?

476
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:24,733
Try looking on the
ground back there.

477
00:22:24,817 --> 00:22:27,775
Shouldn't have messed with me,
that wouldn't have happened.

478
00:22:27,858 --> 00:22:30,025
Is it safe to assume
you're all a group, then?

479
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:32,983
[LEADER gasps]

480
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:34,400
Railgun?!

481
00:23:58,025 --> 00:23:59,442
[LEADER]
Not good, not good, not good!

482
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:01,525
We're still traumatized by the
memory of Academy City's

483
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,358
First-ranked beating
us to a pulp,

484
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,942
and now we have to face off
against the third-ranked,

485
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:07,108
Railgun? No, wait a sec!

486
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:08,983
If we can pull this off, we
might just make our comeback

487
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:10,317
after all!

488
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,025
[NARU] That inner monologue
only took 0.1 seconds!
