[SHOKUHO panting]

2
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,067
[SHOKUHO]
Before you go and die on me,

3
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,067
let's see the data on the virus
you injected into that Sister.

4
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,900
[beeps]

5
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:29,358
[SHOKUHO gasps]

6
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:32,650
Oh, right. That girl.

7
00:02:34,358 --> 00:02:37,067
[clicking, beeping]

8
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,192
[gasps]

9
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:40,733
[KUROKO] I don't have
nearly enough strength

10
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:43,067
to teleport her away right now.

11
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,442
I have no choice
but to contact Uiharu

12
00:02:45,525 --> 00:02:47,525
and request someone
to pick her up.

13
00:02:49,608 --> 00:02:51,942
[KUROKO]
I wonder how Misaka's doing.

14
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:56,692
[KAMIJO grunts]

15
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,567
[SOGIITA]
Don't do it, man.

16
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,733
[KAMIJO]
Sogiita! You can still move?

17
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,108
[SOGIITA]
'Course I can.

18
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:08,150
Just takes a little bit
of guts to stop the bleeding

19
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:10,442
and put the bones back together.

20
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:12,067
But never mind me.

21
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,858
You were about to charge
in there, weren't you?

22
00:03:14,942 --> 00:03:18,567
Yeah, because something
about her just changed.

23
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,525
Whoever sent that info
to my brain had a plan.

24
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:23,692
Maybe they got the job done.

25
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:27,192
Wait, she changed again?
I'm losing track at this point.

26
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:28,733
Either way,

27
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:33,150
it doesn't look like she can
control all that power. So...

28
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:36,275
[SOGIITA] I don't know what that
right hand of yours is made of,

29
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:37,442
but compared to before,

30
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:40,150
that thing is on
a whole other level.

31
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:41,942
When it hit me earlier,
it just felt like some

32
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:45,025
giant mass of
concentrated energy,

33
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:47,858
but now it looks like
something from another world,

34
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:51,608
literally beyond
our understanding.

35
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,192
So leave it to me.

36
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,608
Maybe I can do
something about this

37
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,067
if I risk my neck
to snuff it out.

38
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,150
[KAMIJO] No. Like I said before,
she's someone I know.

39
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:04,400
I want to stop her myself.

40
00:04:04,483 --> 00:04:05,567
I know, but...

41
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,900
[KAMIJO]
You're right.

42
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:09,650
I'm probably not strong
enough to do this myself,

43
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,942
and since we don't
know what's going on,

44
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:14,317
I can't be sure
this is a good idea.

45
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,108
That said... Well, I figure
I can fill in that power gap

46
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,192
with some good old guts.

47
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:23,275
Don't you?

48
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:27,733
Hah! I didn't realize I was
dealing with a comedian.

49
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:29,942
But I hear ya.

50
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:36,233
[SOGIITA yells]

51
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,025
[SOGIITA]
Get in there, man!

52
00:04:42,442 --> 00:04:43,650
[KAMIJO]
A path!

53
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:45,067
Come on!

54
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:56,608
You gonna behave yourself?

55
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:59,233
Or do I have to get mad?

56
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:12,942
[MIKOTO] What is this?
This isn't my ability!

57
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:14,358
It must be...

58
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:17,942
It must be... No!
If this gets unleashed,

59
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:21,483
we'll lose a lot more
than just Academy City!

60
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:24,608
I can't let that
happen. I won't!

61
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,233
[MIKOTO] If I can compress it
down to a size I can cover

62
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:31,442
with my body, then blow it
up while I'm holding it,

63
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:32,442
maybe...

64
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:33,775
[MIKOTO gasps]

65
00:05:35,358 --> 00:05:39,108
[MIKOTO] Him? Is he trying
to stop this thing?

66
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:41,900
Wait a minute! This
isn't just my ability!

67
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:44,442
It's something my heart
conjured up out of anger,

68
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:47,025
out of my desire to destroy
all the horrible things

69
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:49,442
happening in Academy City!

70
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:50,733
So it's up to me to--!

71
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,025
[KAMIJO grunts, yells]

72
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:56,942
Stop it!

73
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:07,775
[MIKOTO gasps]

74
00:06:07,858 --> 00:06:09,608
[grunting]

75
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:15,358
[KAMIJO yells]

76
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,942
[roars]

77
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:19,442
[MIKOTO gasps]

78
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:22,567
[KAMIJO] I know this city has
some screwed up things in it.

79
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,567
Trust me on that.

80
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,067
Stuff controlled by elites
that you and I can't touch.

81
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,317
Manipulating things
from behind the scenes.

82
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,275
I know that, but...

83
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:36,525
To try and get rid of
those things by force?

84
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:38,817
Even if you did succeed,

85
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,317
I don't think you'd get the
world you were hoping for.

86
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,608
But I'm sure you can think
of people besides just me

87
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:46,692
who were trying
to lend you a hand.

88
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:49,650
With their help, you can
start changing things

89
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:53,067
for the better,
little by little.

90
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,733
And, of course,
I'll help you, too.

91
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,275
Wait, your arm!
Quick! We gotta--

92
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:08,858
[KAMIJO]
Oh, uh... Huh?

93
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:11,150
What?

94
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:12,942
It's working like normal.

95
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,067
That is not normal.
What is with your body?

96
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,983
[KAMIJO]
Beats me.

97
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:22,025
Aw, man! Talk about
a killer show!

98
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:24,692
I didn't think I'd be
seein' dragons today.

99
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:26,983
That guy's got some guts!

100
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:30,525
We definitely gotta
spar sometime.

101
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:32,150
Wait, hold up.

102
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:35,150
What's all that
metal-lookin' stuff?

103
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:37,192
Was that there before?

104
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:47,525
[MIKOTO]
So, she's all right, then?

105
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:49,442
Yeah, or, she will be.

106
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:51,608
Luckily, not too long
after she was brought here

107
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:53,900
to be treated, we were
sent all of the data

108
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:57,108
on the virus she
was injected with.

109
00:08:57,192 --> 00:09:00,400
With that, I was able
to synthesize a vaccine.

110
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:02,983
It'll be a few days before
she completely recovers,

111
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:06,192
but when she does,
she'll be as good as new.

112
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:07,983
Thank goodness.

113
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:20,025
[MIKOTO] Um, I think one of
my friends from Tokiwadai

114
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:22,817
was brought to this
hospital earlier today.

115
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:28,525
[knocking]

116
00:09:28,608 --> 00:09:29,775
[KONGO]
Yes?

117
00:09:31,817 --> 00:09:33,567
Hi, Misaka!

118
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,608
[KONGO] Really? So your sister
is going to be all right?

119
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:42,692
That's wonderful to hear.

120
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:45,858
[gasps]

121
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:48,358
Is there something
on your mind?

122
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:49,942
[MIKOTO]
I'm sorry!

123
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:52,150
For dragging you into
this whole mess,

124
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:53,983
and for letting you get hurt.

125
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:56,608
I know "sorry" doesn't
make up for it, but still.

126
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:59,400
No need for that!
I should be apologizing.

127
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:01,275
I said that I would bring
your sister back to you,

128
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:04,275
and instead I ended up
in this sorry state.

129
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:06,108
Quite pathetic, don't you think?

130
00:10:06,192 --> 00:10:08,900
[MIKOTO] Still. We both know
that it could have been

131
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,233
much worse than this.

132
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:13,275
Yes, that is true.

133
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:14,650
What?

134
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:17,275
[KONGO] However, even if
I had been injured worse,

135
00:10:17,358 --> 00:10:20,483
in whatever way, I can
assure you that I would not

136
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:23,692
have regretted my decision
to take such actions.

137
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:26,733
Are you sure?

138
00:10:26,817 --> 00:10:29,025
[KONGO] Absolutely.
This wasn't something

139
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:30,483
I decided on a whim.

140
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:32,108
I'm not yet mature
enough to lay down

141
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:34,400
my life for just anyone.

142
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:36,900
I could see you suffering
and wanted to help.

143
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:39,067
That was the reason
I involved myself,

144
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,317
and I could never regret that.

145
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:43,900
Oh...

146
00:10:48,108 --> 00:10:51,025
"Peach and plum blossoms make
their own paths," after all.

147
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,400
Huh?

148
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:54,483
[KONGO] Though peach and plum
blossoms cannot speak,

149
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,942
trails still form beneath them.

150
00:10:57,025 --> 00:11:00,025
Likewise, with people,
the virtuous do not boast,

151
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:01,942
but others are still
drawn to them.

152
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:03,817
It just happens naturally.

153
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,775
That's what the
expression means.

154
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:06,983
Oh.

155
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,525
[KONGO]
In all honesty,

156
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:11,942
I can't say that I entirely
understand the concept myself.

157
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:14,817
But by following the
example of your character,

158
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,025
I believe I was able
to become a more caring

159
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:21,442
and empathetic person.
At least, I'd like to think.

160
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:22,650
Oh, come on.

161
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,858
It's not like I'm some
sort of role model.

162
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:27,650
[KONGO] That's something for
those around you to decide.

163
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:29,400
Because even if you
present yourself

164
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:31,775
as someone upstanding,
it means nothing

165
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,275
if those around you don't agree.

166
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:36,150
I speak from experience.

167
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:38,983
I've been trying that for
a while, and I'm still alone.

168
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:41,733
But that's not even true!

169
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:44,400
[MIKOTO]
Kongo, in my opinion--

170
00:11:44,483 --> 00:11:48,150
and I'm sure in Wannai and
Awatsuki's, too--you're...

171
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:50,608
Why are you bringing up
Wannai and Awatsuki?

172
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:54,358
What do they have to do with
this topic of conversation?

173
00:11:54,442 --> 00:11:57,275
A lot. They're the
ones who saved you.

174
00:11:57,358 --> 00:11:58,858
[gasps]

175
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:05,650
[KONGO] I see. Those two
did all that for me?

176
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:08,108
Oh. What am I
supposed to do, Misaka?

177
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:09,358
Huh?

178
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:12,108
[KONGO] They got into
a fight because of me.

179
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:14,067
I should feel
inconsolable for putting

180
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,775
them in harm's way. But...

181
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:18,817
For some odd reason,

182
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,400
I can't help but
feel happy about it.

183
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:25,858
[NURSE 14A]
Excuse me.

184
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:28,942
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but visiting hours are over now.

185
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:30,775
[MIKOTO]
Oh, okay.

186
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:33,233
I'll be back again
tomorrow. 'Kay, Kongo?

187
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:36,067
[KONGO]
Okay! Misaka?

188
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,150
I wanted to say,

189
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:44,275
I'm truly grateful that
I'm a Tokiwadai student.

190
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:54,942
[phone vibrates]

191
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,108
[SATEN] "Hey, Misaka! Do you
want to watch the fireworks

192
00:12:57,192 --> 00:12:58,775
at that one spot again tonight?

193
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:01,317
Uiharu and Shirai are
planning on coming, too.

194
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,067
We should all go together!"

195
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:19,858
[KOZAKU]
That Judgment girl isn't here.

196
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:21,400
Handcuffs?

197
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:26,942
I can get out of these
with my ability, no sweat.

198
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:28,942
But why bother?

199
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:32,983
[KOZAKU] If I'm still
alive, then it means

200
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:36,400
that the plan must have failed.

201
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:40,567
Guess I could just stay here
and be food for the rats.

202
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:51,150
[KOZAKU]
Misaki Shokuho?

203
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:03,567
[SATEN]
Misaka! Hey, over here!

204
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,358
Good evening, Sissy!

205
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:06,942
You've had a long day, huh?

206
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:09,483
[SATEN] Are you ready for this?
'Cause I don't think you are.

207
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,775
Check out Uiharu's
gross food of the day.

208
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:13,358
[UIHARU] Oh, would you
give it a rest already?

209
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:15,233
How is Strawberry <i>monja</i> gross?

210
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:17,900
Can't you at least call it
something cuter, like "quirky?"

211
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:20,775
Ugh. Still strange,
whatever you call it.

212
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:22,025
[UIHARU gasps]

213
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:23,525
[SATEN]
I swear, you'll eat anything

214
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:24,483
with strawberries in it.

215
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:27,858
[UIHARU]
That's not true!

216
00:14:27,942 --> 00:14:30,442
[MIKOTO]
Thanks, guys.

217
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:31,650
[SATEN laughs]

218
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:34,525
Sorry, did you say something?

219
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:37,317
[MIKOTO]
Mm-mm.

220
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,150
[UIHARU] Ooh, did you
want a bite of this?

221
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:42,442
[MIKOTO]
No, thanks.

222
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:45,150
[MIKOTO] Kuroko, Saten and
Uiharu's memories of me

223
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:47,817
were put back where they belong.

224
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,733
Though, their memories of
today's events were different.

225
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:52,608
To avoid contradictions
with the accounts

226
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,900
of other people, they
were made to believe

227
00:14:54,983 --> 00:14:56,108
we captured a terrorist

228
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:57,775
who was threatening
the festival.

229
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:05,233
[MIKOTO] I guess Shokuho
also rewrote the reason

230
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:07,733
I didn't show up to
my last few events.

231
00:15:07,817 --> 00:15:09,317
Not out of consideration for me

232
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,400
and my unique
situation or anything.

233
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:14,692
But probably because
she didn't want

234
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:17,567
the existence of
Exterior made public.

235
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,567
Sounds like her.

236
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,775
[MIKOTO]
Either way,

237
00:15:20,858 --> 00:15:23,150
I've gotta give credit
where credit is due.

238
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:26,358
Without Shokuho, that virus
would still be around.

239
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:29,025
And while I thought she was
a pretty rotten person--

240
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:31,733
Well, actually,
I still think that.

241
00:15:31,817 --> 00:15:33,817
Considering that she's
not completely devoid

242
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,942
of a sense of right and wrong,

243
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:39,733
maybe someday, we'll meet
each other halfway.

244
00:15:39,817 --> 00:15:41,733
Maybe.

245
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,400
[SATEN] Oh, come to
think of it, Misaka,

246
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:45,817
is your stomach doing all right?

247
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,442
Huh? Whaddya mean?

248
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:49,358
You ate something bad
from a street food stall

249
00:15:49,442 --> 00:15:51,025
and it upset your
stomach, right?

250
00:15:51,108 --> 00:15:52,400
Yeah, that's what I heard, too.

251
00:15:52,483 --> 00:15:53,650
And that you were
stuck in the bathroom

252
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:55,317
for pretty much the entire day.

253
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,692
Then when Shokuho and her clique

254
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:58,150
came to get you,
you threatened them

255
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:00,067
and refused to leave the stall.

256
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,108
The bathroom?

257
00:16:02,192 --> 00:16:03,358
[MIKOTO]
Unless you're ready to kill me

258
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:06,817
right here and now, then move.

259
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,525
It's kind of the only thing
our school is talking about.

260
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:13,692
Specifically, how "urgent"
things were for you.

261
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:17,400
[MIKOTO] Well, that settles it.
You're dead, Shokuho.

262
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:29,900
[SATEN yelling]

263
00:16:29,983 --> 00:16:32,983
[STUDENT 14A] I'm so dizzy,
I can't use my ability.

264
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:36,525
[UIHARU]
Saten, you came in first!

265
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:39,817
[SATEN] Yeah, well, I've got
some experience handling a bat!

266
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:46,233
Wow, you're light!

267
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:51,317
The Gods of Wind and Lightning.

268
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,275
Make a triumphant return!

269
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:08,608
It's kinda hard to believe,
but the festival's almost over.

270
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,525
Feels like forever,
but at the same time,

271
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:12,025
like it just started.

272
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:14,942
I can't believe I ended up
not competing in a single event.

273
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:17,025
If only I hadn't gotten
hurt on the second day.

274
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:20,067
I could have at least worked
with Sissy on the final one!

275
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,858
It's not like you
really had a choice.

276
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:24,483
You got hurt stopping
a terrorist attack.

277
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,983
Just think of your injuries
as a badge of honor.

278
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:29,192
Well. I suppose I will.

279
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:31,025
I know this is going
to sound strange,

280
00:17:31,108 --> 00:17:32,817
but whenever I think
about that day,

281
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,525
it feels like I'm forgetting
something really important.

282
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:38,400
Really? You, too, Shirai?

283
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:40,150
I figured that was
all just in my head.

284
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,733
Uh. I'm gonna go buy
some drinks for everyone.

285
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:44,442
What're you all in the mood for?

286
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:45,358
[UIHARU]
Huh?

287
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:46,733
[SATEN]
Are you sure?

288
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,942
[MIKOTO] Mm-hm! It's my treat
for all your hard work

289
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:50,275
during the festival.

290
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:52,067
Then I'll take a Coconut Cider.

291
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,442
I could go for a
Habanero Pineapple.

292
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:56,775
And one Watermelon Tea,
for me, please.

293
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:59,942
You got it. Be right back!

294
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:02,025
[gasps] Look at that!

295
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:03,525
They're holding a folk dance!

296
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:06,317
[UIHARU]
That looks like it could be fun.

297
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
I wouldn't mind
gettin' out there

298
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:09,483
and bustin' a move myself.

299
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:12,442
But it's not like I have someone
I can dance with, so...

300
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:13,983
Yeah, same goes for me.

301
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:16,108
[KUROKO] If only I hadn't
gotten hurt again,

302
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:17,150
Sissy and I could be--

303
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:18,150
[KAMIJO]
Huh?

304
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:21,692
Uh... Lemme think.
Saten, right?

305
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:23,817
Uh... Hey, Kamijo.

306
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,650
Hey.

307
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:25,775
[KUROKO]
Ugh.

308
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:28,067
This is lucky.
I never got to thank you.

309
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,067
For the scavenger hunt, I mean.

310
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,608
Oh. Yeah, I guess not, huh?

311
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:34,650
I could treat you to
something here if you want.

312
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:36,525
Just nothing too expensive.

313
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:38,358
[SATEN]
Oh, no, that's way too generous.

314
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:39,650
I couldn't let you do that.

315
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:42,233
Thanks for waiting!

316
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:45,233
Huh?! Hold on a second,
what are you doing here?

317
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:47,400
And wait, you and Saten
know each other? How?

318
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:50,192
[KAMIJO] Oh. She lent me
her good-luck charm.

319
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:51,650
[MIKOTO]
Her "good-luck charm"?

320
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,317
What does that mean?

321
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,317
Uh, I needed
a good-luck charm

322
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,067
for a scavenger hunt
the other day,

323
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,733
and she lent me hers.

324
00:18:59,817 --> 00:19:04,525
[MIKOTO] Oh, the scavenger hunt.
Right. Sure, that makes sense.

325
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:05,858
[KAMIJO]
I wasn't having any luck.

326
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:07,692
She really came in clutch.

327
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:10,900
[SATEN]
Hey, Kamijo.

328
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,733
This might sound funny,
but I thought of a way

329
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:15,775
you can repay me for
the good-luck charm.

330
00:19:15,858 --> 00:19:17,317
Do you think you'd be
willing to join in

331
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,858
on the folk dance over there?

332
00:19:18,942 --> 00:19:19,942
Huh?

333
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:20,775
[KUROKO]
Huh?

334
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:22,025
Huh?!

335
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:25,650
I mean, it's no problem,
but are you sure?

336
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:29,567
Yup! Oh, but if you don't mind,
why don't you go on ahead?

337
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,692
My throat's dry, so I'm gonna
have some of this drink first.

338
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:33,775
[KAMIJO]
Okay...

339
00:19:33,858 --> 00:19:38,692
[SATEN laughs]

340
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:39,733
[SATEN]
Now.

341
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:42,650
[SATEN yelps]
Oh, no!

342
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:44,233
My soreness from
the obstacle course

343
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,567
just caught up to me
all at once!

344
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,275
[MIKOTO]
Whoa, are you all right?

345
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:51,442
No, my ankle hurts!

346
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,233
I think I twisted it!

347
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,567
Sissy, be careful,
this is a trap!

348
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,233
Aw, man. I can
probably walk on it,

349
00:19:58,317 --> 00:20:00,567
but I doubt I could
do anything more.

350
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,067
Oh. I know! Hey, Misaka.

351
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,525
Do me a favor and go
dance in my place.

352
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:06,775
Huh?

353
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:09,733
Wait, what?
I don't understand.

354
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:10,983
Why does it have to be me?

355
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:12,525
And you can't ask someone
to dance with you,

356
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:13,692
then throw them someone else!

357
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:15,233
That would be a valid point.

358
00:20:15,317 --> 00:20:18,025
But I never said anything about
dancing "with me," did I?

359
00:20:18,108 --> 00:20:19,442
But this is all so sudden.

360
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:21,358
We're talking really
last minute here!

361
00:20:21,442 --> 00:20:23,817
Right? I mean, maybe
next time, I could--

362
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,275
But you're gonna
dance this time.

363
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,942
Isn't that right?
For your friend?

364
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:30,108
[MIKOTO]
F-For my friend.

365
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,567
Huh? Misaka?

366
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:43,775
[yelps]

367
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,775
So, I'm a little confused.
What are we--

368
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:52,733
Wow. Her movements are stiff.

369
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:57,067
No interrupting
them now, Shirai.

370
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:05,400
Uh, now, the right
hand goes up,

371
00:21:05,483 --> 00:21:08,150
and remind me what's next?

372
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,067
[MIKOTO]
You ended up saving me again.

373
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,567
Huh? Yeah.

374
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,692
Really, I just helped out a
little bit at the end, though.

375
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:16,733
You had other people out there

376
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,858
watching your back,
too. Remember?

377
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:23,317
[MIKOTO]
Mm-hm. A lot of people.

378
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,567
My friends did so much for me.

379
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,900
So...

380
00:21:27,983 --> 00:21:29,317
[KAMIJO]
Hm?

381
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,525
I, uh, don't think
I'll ever forgive

382
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:33,233
the bad people in this city.

383
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:36,275
Especially when they treat
espers like lab rats.

384
00:21:36,358 --> 00:21:38,525
That said, I did meet
all of you because

385
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:41,775
I came to this city,
and to be honest,

386
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:44,525
I treasure those relationships.

387
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:46,233
So next time,
I wanna be the one

388
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:48,650
protecting my friends.

389
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:51,108
It's obvious, but it's
the least I can do

390
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:53,983
in return for everyone's help.

391
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,108
Yeah.

392
00:21:55,192 --> 00:21:58,983
Um... And that's all
I wanted to say!

393
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,692
[KAMIJO] Interesting.
So that's how you feel.

394
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:03,067
I had no idea that you treasured

395
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,733
having met me so much.
It's kinda flattering!

396
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:07,233
[yelps]

397
00:22:07,317 --> 00:22:08,692
Or am I wrong?

398
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:10,817
'Cause the way that you just
said it includes me, too.

399
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,150
That's what you intended, right?

400
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:15,775
Uh. Hey, Misaka?

401
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:17,150
That was your cue to jab back.

402
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:19,400
[KUROKO]
All right, your time is up!

403
00:22:20,442 --> 00:22:21,942
[SATEN]
Right. She teleports.

404
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:24,275
[UIHARU] She lasted a
good while there, too.

405
00:23:58,942 --> 00:24:00,775
[SHOKUHO] "If you want to make
your way in Academy City,

406
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:01,900
the most effective method

407
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,942
is to suck up to
the researchers here.

408
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,567
However, I wasn't
counting on having

409
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,942
that girl forced
on me as a result."

410
00:24:08,025 --> 00:24:09,400
[KOZAKU]
What the--

411
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:11,692
Who said you could read my mind
without asking me first?
