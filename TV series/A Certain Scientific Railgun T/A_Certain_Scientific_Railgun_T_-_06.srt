of shutdown command.

Huh.

00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:31,775
Even away from the pond,
she can control

175
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:33,692
a pretty decent amount of water.

The Great Dane Type

I pretty much have her analyzed.

a limit on the weight

the water they can control,

If I can get her far enough
away from the pond,

I got from the Doctor!

320
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,275
Have you decided to give up yet?

321
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:22,567
I said I didn't like
fistfights before,

322
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,608
but that doesn't mean
I can't hold my own in one.

323
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:29,150
I was trained in assassination
skills throughout my childhood.

324
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:30,900
Family situation, you see.

325
00:16:30,983 --> 00:16:32,983
I know many techniques
that we're normally forbidden

326
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:34,400
from using.

327
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:36,108
But seeing as how you've
turned out to be so strong,

328
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:37,567
my hands are tied.

329
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,775
I just need to keep her
attention with these bluffs

330
00:16:39,858 --> 00:16:41,775
long enough for the Mosquito
Type to inject her

331
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:44,233
with the nanodevice!

332
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:45,442
Almost there!

333
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:46,983
A little more!

334
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:48,900
[gasps]
It dropped?!

335
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:50,067
Is the battery dead?

336
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,025
No way, I just
activated the thing!

337
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:53,942
Wait, the way it's moving...

338
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:55,275
[AWATSUKI]
I'm glad to see you're safe.

339
00:16:55,358 --> 00:16:56,275
[BABA yelps]

340
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:57,817
[WANNAI]
Awatsuki!

341
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,233
[AWATSUKI] The one I went
after turned out to be empty.

342
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:02,358
And based on his
behavior so far,

343
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:03,817
I figured if you got
the upper hand,

344
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,817
this guy would try
to use the nanodevice,

345
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,150
so I lowered the buoyancy
around you to zero.

346
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:10,400
And it looks like that
was the right decision.

347
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:11,567
[BABA]
Buoyancy?

348
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,733
You mean her ability
wasn't telekinesis?

349
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:16,733
It's buoyancy manipulation?

350
00:17:16,817 --> 00:17:18,775
Wait a minute,
let's think this through!

351
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:20,442
Are you two espers
really planning on striking

352
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:22,108
an unarmed man?

353
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:24,400
I'm just a hired hand
in all of this!

354
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:26,608
And I can't do anything
with the mosquito robot now.

355
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:28,192
Look, it's dead on the ground!

356
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:29,733
Sure, maybe I was being
a little too rough

357
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:30,983
with your friend earlier,

358
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:32,525
but can't we just
agree to walk awa--

359
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:35,983
[BABA yells]

360
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:38,942
I apologize if I'm being
presumptuous here.

361
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,650
But I think the reason
you hate seeing us

362
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,150
stand up for a friend

363
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:45,400
is because you don't have
anyone who'd do that for you.

364
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:47,067
But it makes sense.

365
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,317
That happens when
you're condescending.

366
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,942
You've closed yourself off.

367
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:53,858
Unless you start
letting people in,

368
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:56,525
and show them that you're
willing to meet them halfway,

369
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,567
no one will want to help you.

370
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:02,983
[BABA yelling]

371
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:09,942
I'm not exactly experienced in
the ways of the world, either.

372
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:11,108
Hey.

373
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:13,108
You don't have to be
so hard on yourself.

374
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,483
I think that was good advice
and he needed to hear it.

375
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:19,317
I just hope he takes this
opportunity to rethink his ways.

376
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:23,942
[BABA panting]

377
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:27,067
Damn them!

378
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,400
Those girls think
they're better than me!

379
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:33,108
I'll make them pay
for looking down on me!

380
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:35,775
[BABA panting]

381
00:18:35,858 --> 00:18:38,275
It's all intel.

382
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:39,775
If I'd only known
what their powers were

383
00:18:39,858 --> 00:18:41,317
before going into that fight,

384
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,192
there's no way I would
have lost to them!

385
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,858
Mantis Type!

386
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:49,400
I didn't think I should use
you because you stick out,

387
00:18:49,483 --> 00:18:51,067
but your power is in
a whole other league

388
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,067
from those glorified
tracking dogs.

389
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,400
Now that I know everything
about their abilities,

390
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:58,608
there's no way
I could possibly lose!

391
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:00,483
Go get 'em, Mantis Type!

392
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:06,650
This is payback.

393
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:09,358
Merely killing them isn't
gonna be enough anymore.

394
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:11,567
I'll capture and humiliate them!

395
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,858
I'll take some racy photos and
post 'em everywhere online!

396
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:17,775
I'll crush their dignity and
live stream it to the world!

397
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:20,317
And not only destroy them
mentally and physically...

398
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,025
I'll destroy their social
lives on top of it!

399
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:25,025
Then when they cry
and beg me to kill 'em...

00:19:25,108 --> 00:19:27,400
[beeping]

401
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:29,192
That's the GPS signal
from the Mosquito Type

402
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:32,192
I attached to Mitsuko Kongo.

403
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:34,233
What's it doing here?

404
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:36,358
And why's it on a direct
path toward me?

405
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:42,692
What?! How?!

406
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,983
What is this?
Why is Mikoto Misaka here?

407
00:19:50,817 --> 00:19:52,858
Impossible!
She shouldn't be able to move!

408
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,275
I shot the nanodevice into her!

409
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:56,900
Oh! That's gotta be it!

410
00:19:56,983 --> 00:19:59,067
She's not the real
Misaka at all, is she?

That's one of the Sisters!

412
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,858
My luck's turning around!

413
00:20:03,942 --> 00:20:06,317
I'll capture her
and redeem myself!

414
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,817
I can deal with those
other girls afterwards!

seize that girl! Now!

I know you can hear me.

I avoided the
communication system.

from the comm signal.

the entire system?

At least, that's what
I'd like to do,

that you might be under

Make no mistake.

If I ever see one
of these again,

or if they go near my friends...

...or if you so much as
look in their direction...

Then no matter where you are,

It's Baba.

He's lost all of his robo-pawns.

And now he's looking
to lay low somewhere.

he says he's neutralized Misaka,
but now she's out and about.
