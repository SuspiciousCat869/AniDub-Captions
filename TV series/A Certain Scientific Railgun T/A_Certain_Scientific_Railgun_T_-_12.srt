00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:45,400
[SOGIITA]
Super Amazing...

2
00:00:47,192 --> 00:00:49,775
...Punch!

3
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:57,942
[KAMIJO]
Awesome!

4
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,192
Now's your chance, bud!

5
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:01,817
No, no, no, no!
Hold on, hold on, wait! Stop!

6
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,942
Good luck!

7
00:01:03,025 --> 00:01:04,817
[KAMIJO yells]

8
00:01:12,317 --> 00:01:14,025
I'm here, might as well try!

9
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:22,858
Wait, how do I land?

10
00:01:22,942 --> 00:01:24,108
What do I do?

11
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:25,233
[KAMIJO grunts]

12
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:34,108
That works.

13
00:01:34,192 --> 00:01:36,317
Uh, thank you.

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,942
Even though you're
the reason I was in danger

15
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:39,275
in the first place.

16
00:01:39,358 --> 00:01:40,108
[SOGIITA]
Well?

17
00:01:40,192 --> 00:01:41,733
No dice.

18
00:01:41,817 --> 00:01:43,275
There's some sort of
power flowing into her

19
00:01:43,358 --> 00:01:46,150
from the outside,
and I can't cancel it.

20
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:48,525
It worked for a second
on the area I touched.

21
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,025
But it didn't last long.

22
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:51,858
Okay, so now what?

23
00:01:51,942 --> 00:01:53,858
[KAMIJO] Well, apparently
there's someone aside from us

24
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:56,025
trying to turn her
back to normal.

25
00:01:56,108 --> 00:01:59,567
Though, I have no idea
who they are.

26
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,150
But until they can
shut down this power

27
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:04,692
at the source, all we
can do is slow her down.

28
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:06,858
And from what this
person was telling me,

29
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:08,733
as long as I stick around,

30
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:11,692
I should be able to delay
her transformation a little.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,233
'Kay. But she's clearly
still changin' over there.

32
00:02:34,317 --> 00:02:37,608
[KAMIJO] Well, they said slow
down, not completely stop.

33
00:02:46,442 --> 00:02:48,900
[KAMIJO]
S-Sogiita!

34
00:02:48,983 --> 00:02:50,025
[SOGIITA grunts]

35
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:55,650
Man. I let my guard down.
Pathetic.

36
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:57,067
[KAMIJO]
Are you actually okay?

37
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,608
How could that
not have hurt you?

38
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:00,817
You're insane, man.

39
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,525
Looks like I'm gonna
have to put some more

40
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:03,983
guts into this.

41
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:11,483
[SHOKUHO] Gensei is after
something, and that puppet

42
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,608
wasn't trying to kill me.

43
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:16,108
It was trying to
capture me alive.

44
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:17,942
So he probably thinks
he can get information

45
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:19,942
out of me.

46
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:22,233
And I'd be willing to bet

47
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:24,567
he wants Exterior's
limiter release code.

48
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:05,233
[KUROKO]
The camera. There it is!

49
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,067
[KUROKO] If the data in
the Bank is correct,

50
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,358
Kozaku's puppets don't
see like humans do.

51
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:17,900
She senses her surroundings
the way a bat does

52
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:19,650
using echolocation.

53
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,400
And it's sensitive enough
to pick up the sound

54
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:26,733
of a heartbeat within
a few dozen meters.

55
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:28,692
The camera's supplementary.

56
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:29,900
This calls for...

57
00:05:34,608 --> 00:05:37,567
...the anti-listening devices
I have for security.

58
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,400
For the moment,
I've effectively deprived

59
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:42,108
Kozaku of her eyes and ears.

60
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:43,525
Now let's find her.

61
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:48,233
[GENSEI] Good heavens,
that Shokuho girl really is

62
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:50,858
the overly cautious one,
isn't she.

63
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:52,983
I can't find a trace of
how to remove the limiter

64
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:54,858
on Exterior, and I'm
sure that's exactly

65
00:05:54,942 --> 00:05:56,150
what she's hoping for.

66
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:58,233
What a wild goose chase this is.

67
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:03,983
[SHOKUHO]
I knew it. He is after that.

68
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:07,525
To be able to accurately
control Misaka in that state,

69
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:09,442
he must need more
power than Exterior

70
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:11,942
can currently provide.

71
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:13,983
That's why he has
to unlock the limiter.

72
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:19,483
All of the major function
codes for Exterior

73
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:22,192
have been erased
from external memory.

74
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:23,567
But they're still
inside my head

75
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,067
with picture perfect clarity.

76
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,067
The key to Exterior's
defense is its covertness.

77
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,108
Ideally, no one should ever
know that it even exists.

78
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:36,942
But, in case word got out,
I have other measures in place.

79
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:39,692
[GENSEI]
Hm?

80
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:47,025
[SHOKUHO] This building
and those surrounding it

81
00:06:47,108 --> 00:06:50,067
have a security system
unlike any other.

82
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,983
Naturally this includes
several traps.

83
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:55,150
Ones that only I can activate.

84
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:57,858
It'd sure be nice if this
sleeping gas worked.

85
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,317
[GENSEI]
My Multiskill.

86
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,275
While I may not have
nearly as many abilities

87
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:10,317
at my disposal as Kiyama,

88
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,525
I do have a small, curated
selection of kidnapped--

89
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:17,358
I mean, secured people,
whose powers I've borrowed.

90
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:19,900
But of course, you must
have anticipated me

91
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:22,150
taking such measures.

92
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,275
[SHOKUHO] Ugh. That is
one despicable old man.

93
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:28,108
But this isn't over
just because he got

94
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:29,400
through that trap.

95
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,733
If gassing him won't work,
then let's try this.

96
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:34,983
[GENSEI]
No luck.

97
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:37,067
[SHOKUHO growls]

98
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,942
Mind if I ask you something
while we're doing this?

99
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:41,567
[GENSEI]
What is it?

100
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,150
[SHOKUHO]
As I recall,

101
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:46,650
you concluded only one esper had
a chance of reaching Level 6.

102
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,567
And unsurprisingly,
that was the first-ranked

103
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,608
Level 5, wasn't it?

104
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:52,233
Mmm. Correct.

105
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:53,900
I believe he's the only
one who can achieve

106
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:58,108
a stable Level 6,
at least currently.

107
00:07:58,192 --> 00:08:00,025
Stable?

108
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:02,567
[GENSEI] So at the moment,
we're letting Misaka's powers

109
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,400
run wild in an attempt
to forcefully push her

110
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:07,900
towards Level 6.

111
00:08:07,983 --> 00:08:10,233
If she keeps growing
as she has been,

112
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:14,025
then theoretically,
when she reaches 53% completion,

113
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:18,108
her mind will transform into
an other-dimensional entity.

114
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:20,108
And, once she has
reached that point

115
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:21,358
in her evolution,

116
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:23,608
we'll require the limiter
unlock code

117
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:26,317
to even keep her
enmeshed in our world.

118
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,567
Finally, when she reaches 100%,
the moment she becomes Level 6,

119
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,442
both her body and mind
will reach their limit,

120
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:38,275
and I theorize that she'll
come apart as an individual.

121
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,650
To put it in simplest terms,

122
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,858
Misaka is incapable
of attaining a stable

123
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:49,150
Level 6 form.

124
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:52,192
However, in exchange
for losing everything...

125
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:53,442
For a moment,

126
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:54,858
one that will
no doubt be shorter

127
00:08:54,942 --> 00:08:56,858
than the blink of an eye,

128
00:08:56,942 --> 00:08:59,025
she will be able to catch
a fleeting glimpse

129
00:08:59,108 --> 00:09:01,067
at the realm of gods.

130
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,108
And as a result,
she will either wither away,

131
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:06,942
like a white dwarf
star slowly fading

132
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:08,400
into a black one,

133
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:11,817
or she will explode
like a supernova,

134
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,525
with enough force to break open

135
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:16,983
and shatter the doorway
to a new world.

136
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:20,400
Whichever way she goes,
one thing is for certain--

137
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:22,150
we'll all witness
something big enough

138
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:26,317
to blow this city off
the face of the planet.

139
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,275
[SHOKUHO]
If Academy City gets destroyed,

140
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:29,608
you do realize
you'll be caught up

141
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:31,483
in the middle of it
too, don't you?

142
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:32,775
I know that you're a monster,

143
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:34,858
but I wouldn't have
guessed you were suicidal.

144
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,983
[GENSEI laughs]

145
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:44,983
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

146
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,983
I fail to see the problem.

147
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,650
In order to advance science,

148
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:51,650
you must be willing
to make sacrifices.

149
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,108
Spoken like a madman.

150
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,942
This is exactly the
reason I hate dealing

151
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:57,275
with people who are
running low on sanity.

152
00:09:57,358 --> 00:09:59,692
[GENSEI] This "clairvoyance"
business is surprisingly

153
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:02,608
inconvenient once
you start using it, huh?

154
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:04,442
Even though I can see
through the obstructions

155
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:06,442
before me, I need
to be very precise

156
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:08,567
in calculating the
distance and direction

157
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,150
of my target.

158
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:14,692
Dealing with it has wasted
a lot of my valuable time.

159
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:17,525
Now, even if I were to
try to use Mental Out

160
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:19,358
to read your memories,

161
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:20,942
you could just use
the same ability

162
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:23,858
to lock me out of
your brain entirely.

163
00:10:23,942 --> 00:10:27,650
However, if I put you in
a state where you can't use it,

164
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:30,442
such as inflicting an
intolerable level of pain,

165
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:32,442
or knocking you unconscious,

166
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:34,483
I could get through
quite easily.

167
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:39,400
[SHOKUHO]
The air... I can't breathe!

168
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:41,650
Fortunately for me,
you seem rather weak,

169
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:43,192
so I imagine you'll
give in quickly

170
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,400
before I have to waste
more of my time.

171
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:49,317
Misaka must have grown plenty
in the time I've spent with you.

172
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,525
Ha ha!

173
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,150
I had anticipated some
kind of interference

174
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:54,817
from Kamijo, but never
in my wildest dreams

175
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,483
did I think Sogiita would
join the fight as well!

176
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,483
Now I have the stimulus
of Imagine Breaker,

177
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:01,775
and the extraordinary power
of the seventh-ranked!

178
00:11:01,858 --> 00:11:03,483
It's a sight to behold
as exceptional

179
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:05,817
as dividing the
universe by zero!

180
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,317
If those two clashed with Misaka

181
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,567
and multiplied her power,
it'd be extraordinary!

182
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,900
I have to go.

183
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:12,733
I need to gather all
the analytical espers

184
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:15,900
and equipment I have
to observe this!

185
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:17,692
No. No!

186
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:21,483
[SHOKUHO]
What is he, an idiot? Whatever.

187
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:23,233
At least I got something
out of listening

188
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:25,108
to his little speech.

189
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:27,025
It sounds like as long
as I can keep the limiter

190
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:30,400
unlock code safe, then
Academy City will be spared,

191
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:32,483
with Misaka being
the only casualty.

192
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,108
Thanks a lot, Misaka.

193
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:39,233
You won't be forgotten...
for at least a week.

194
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:44,858
Yeah. If it happens, it happens.

195
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:47,025
There's nothing
I can do about it.

196
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:48,567
Doubt he's gonna quit
chasing me just because

197
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,317
I got away at
the first opportunity.

198
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Sheesh.

199
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:53,858
If Mental Out
were the only ability

200
00:11:53,942 --> 00:11:57,108
he had access to,
this would be a lot easier.

201
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:58,942
But what am I supposed
to do against a fossil

202
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:01,817
who cheats by using
Multiskill like that?

203
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,983
At this point, this special
defense system of mine

204
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:05,442
isn't gonna do much
more than buy me

205
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,858
some extra time.

206
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,400
[SHOKUHO]
Graviton panels?

207
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:26,192
[clatter]

208
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:35,317
I guess she's not
in here either.

209
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,775
No good.

210
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,025
It's going to take too long
to search for her blindly.

211
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:42,400
I need a lead.

212
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:43,733
[SATEN]
I found her!

213
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:47,108
This is totally Kozaku, right?

214
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:52,983
[UIHARU] Saten just found the
suspect on security footage.

215
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:54,275
Sending it your way now.

216
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,275
The timestamp is
three minutes ago.

217
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,400
Since she hasn't shown up
on any other camera,

218
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:00,608
I should be able to figure
out which building she's in.

219
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:01,858
I'll head there now!

220
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,192
[KOZAKU] That's weird.
She's heading in my direction?

221
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:09,858
The security cameras!

222
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:11,067
Are you kidding?

223
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,400
Those guys only covered
their own tracks

224
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:13,608
and not mine?

225
00:13:21,358 --> 00:13:22,650
[KUROKO] And you're sure
she hasn't shown up

226
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,358
on any other cameras
in the area?

227
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:27,817
Mm-hmm. I checked,
and she isn't anywhere else.

228
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,983
[KUROKO] If she tries to move
to another building now,

229
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:32,317
the security cameras
will definitely see it!

230
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:36,483
[KUROKO]
She's in there.

231
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,525
Uiharu, fix all of the
nearby movable cameras

232
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:42,817
on the target building!

233
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,858
Okay!

234
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:53,650
[SATEN] At the rate she's going,
she'll find her in no time.

235
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,567
Maybe, but let's stay focused.

236
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,358
But the computer will detect
anything that moves

237
00:13:57,442 --> 00:13:58,483
and let us know.

238
00:13:58,567 --> 00:13:59,900
It's not like we
can't look away.

239
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:01,317
[beeping]

240
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,692
[UIHARU]
What the--?

241
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,317
[SATEN] Was that the alert?
Did you find something?

242
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,942
[UIHARU]
Can you be quiet for a second?

243
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:07,108
[SATEN]
Oh, right.

244
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:09,317
[UIHARU]
Look!

245
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,275
It's using the sewage pipes?

246
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:14,317
[UIHARU] Shirai, the puppet
is heading your way, and fast!

247
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:19,775
[KUROKO]
That must mean that I am close.

248
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,358
[SATEN] Is she sending
her puppet to destroy

249
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:22,900
the surveillance cameras?

250
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:24,942
Maybe, and we don't
want her creating

251
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:27,483
a new blind spot
and using it to escape.

252
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,858
Although, every one of
the directional cameras

253
00:14:29,942 --> 00:14:32,442
in the area are fixed
on this building.

254
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:33,858
She would need a lot
of time to take out

255
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:35,525
enough of them to
secure herself a viable

256
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,025
escape route.

257
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:39,150
I have to find her
before that happens.

258
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:40,525
[crash]

259
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:46,192
So she's not after
the network of cameras,

260
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:48,400
but taking me out?

261
00:14:48,483 --> 00:14:49,900
Well that works for me!

262
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:52,067
I'll take advantage
of her impatience,

263
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,025
and take out this
puppet of hers!

264
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:58,608
Now that I know her ability
and how to counter it,

265
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:00,483
the threat it poses is minimal.

266
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:03,983
[KUROKO yells]

267
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:10,067
[KUROKO grunts]

268
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,900
[UIHARU] What's the matter,
Shirai? Did something--?

269
00:15:11,983 --> 00:15:13,400
[KUROKO]
I was just careless.

270
00:15:13,483 --> 00:15:16,275
So I ended up taking
a little counter damage.

271
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:18,817
[UIHARU] Huh? Are you
sure you're all right?

272
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,317
[KUROKO]
Yes, it's not a big deal.

273
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,358
She only grazed my side,

274
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:26,525
but the cut on my arm
went a lot deeper.

275
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,442
And after my old wounds
were starting to heal!

276
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:32,108
I'm supposed to be
saving this body

277
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:33,317
for when I get married!

278
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:37,442
Still, now I'm certain.

279
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:39,483
Kozaku really is here.

280
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:44,900
Moreover, she's on
the upper floors.

281
00:15:44,983 --> 00:15:47,150
That last attack was
able to hit its target

282
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:49,150
despite my
anti-listening devices

283
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:52,108
blocking out the puppet's
senses at the time.

284
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:54,233
Which means that Kozaku
herself saw me

285
00:15:54,317 --> 00:15:56,150
and directed the strike.

286
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:58,983
Further, each appendage
took similar paths.

287
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:01,525
She was trying to
catch me linearly.

288
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:03,775
Most likely, she was
watching from above,

289
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:05,358
couldn't tell my precise
location,

290
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,483
and split the attack up
to increase her chances

291
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,567
of hitting me.

292
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,275
If I come at her from below,
she has nowhere to run.

293
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:15,817
It's only a matter
of time before I catch

294
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,942
her real body.

295
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:19,400
But, truth be told,

296
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:21,942
something doesn't
feel quite right.

297
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:23,942
Like there's something
that I've overlooked.

298
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:35,025
[GENSEI]
Hm?

299
00:16:35,108 --> 00:16:36,983
Ah, Shokuho!

300
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:39,442
[chuckles] Hey.

301
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:41,483
Forgive me for getting
so excited earlier.

302
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,400
I should really try
to act my own age.

303
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:46,942
It's just that when I see
something I wasn't expecting,

304
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:48,108
that's it.

305
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:49,483
I'm practically blind
to everything else

306
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:51,317
around me until I calm down.

307
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,900
That bad habit
has almost killed me

308
00:16:52,983 --> 00:16:54,483
a number of times.

309
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:56,150
[SHOKUHO] I wish it had
so I didn't have to deal

310
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:57,525
with you anymore.

311
00:16:57,608 --> 00:17:00,483
[GENSEI]
But this is unexpected.

312
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,942
For you to be standing there,

313
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:04,358
in the middle of the hallway,
waiting for me?

314
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:07,733
I was certain you'd be
keeping your distance.

315
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:09,150
[SHOKUHO]
Why waste the energy?

316
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:10,442
I doubt I could get
away from you

317
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:12,358
with your clairvoyance.

318
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:14,067
And if you caught me
outside this building,

319
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,192
I wouldn't have access
to my security measures

320
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:18,817
and I'd be completely
defenseless.

321
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,775
So. I came to make a deal.

322
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:23,650
[GENSEI]
What kind of deal?

323
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,608
One where I tell you what
the limiter unlock code

324
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:29,317
for Exterior is,
and you let me go.

325
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,608
Huh?

326
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,275
[SHOKUHO] I thought about
it for a little while,

327
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:33,608
and decided that
I really don't care

328
00:17:33,692 --> 00:17:35,233
what happens to Misaka.

329
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:37,900
And if Academy City is
getting blown off the map,

330
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:40,817
I have to make sure
I get out of here first.

331
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,067
So I've waited for you.

332
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,525
You'll find me anyway,
so why waste

333
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:45,608
any time running around
when I can use it

334
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:46,942
to get out of the city?

335
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,108
Hmm. That does make sense.

336
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:52,150
[SHOKUHO]
Good, almost there.

337
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,608
[GENSEI] But this negotiation
feels a bit one-sided.

338
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:56,567
What do I get out of the deal?

339
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,733
[SHOKUHO] Well, I can't
exactly use my Mental Out

340
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:00,692
on you anymore, right?

341
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:03,317
And this situation
has made me realize

342
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
without my ability,
I'm simply an elegant,

343
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:08,275
captivating young woman
with a knockout figure.

344
00:18:08,358 --> 00:18:09,817
And you don't want
to have beating up

345
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,442
a delicate girl like me weighing
on your conscience, do you?

346
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,692
Unless that's how
you get your kicks,

347
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:17,567
but I have a feeling it's not.

348
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:22,442
My ultra-high-power-
oscillator-embedded trap,

349
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:24,067
the "Hag's Hug."

350
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,108
Once you step on it,
you're finished.

351
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,692
The vibrations will shoot
up through your foot.

352
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:33,150
They'll reflect and amplify
through your body

353
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:35,817
as they travel up and
converge in your head.

354
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,233
It'll destroy your ears'
semicircular canals

355
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,983
and give your brain
a good shake!

356
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:41,775
[GENSEI]
Hmm.

357
00:18:41,858 --> 00:18:43,275
[SHOKUHO]
One more step.

358
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:45,442
[SHOKUHO gasps]

359
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,900
[GENSEI]
You're right.

360
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:49,275
As long as I get my hands
on the limiter unlock code,

361
00:18:49,358 --> 00:18:52,192
I don't need you for
any particular reason.

362
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:55,150
But there is one thing
that concerns me.

363
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,317
I noticed you've been
fixated on this particular

364
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,858
spot for the last few minutes.

365
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:01,817
Is there perhaps something
waiting there for me?

366
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,108
You knew?

367
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:07,275
Yeah, just kidding.

368
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:08,650
[GENSEI gasps]

369
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:09,983
[SHOKUHO]
That was a decoy!

370
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,733
The actual trap was
right under your feet

371
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,150
the entire time!

372
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:14,983
Graviton panels.

373
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:16,858
Normally, they just form
a pathway for me

374
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:19,317
to use as my own
personal shortcut,

375
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,858
but this time,
I set them up to mimic

376
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:22,733
the floor before you got here.

377
00:19:22,817 --> 00:19:24,442
Enjoy being trapped down there.

378
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,192
Are his feet exploding?

379
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,567
No, he's compressing
the air underneath them

380
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,067
to make steps.

381
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,525
That's how he was
able to choke me

382
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,192
and change the direction
of those flames

383
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:39,942
I shot at him earlier.

384
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:41,733
He has the Aero Shooter ability!

385
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:53,983
[SHOKUHO grunts]

386
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:00,567
[SHOKUHO grunts]

387
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:03,817
[GENSEI]
That's enough.

388
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,317
I don't intend to spend
any more time

389
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,025
on you, Princess, okay?

390
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:10,525
You won't get away this time.

391
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:12,025
Let's end this now.

392
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:19,233
[GENSEI yells]

393
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:26,150
[SHOKUHO]
How do you like that?

394
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:27,983
Looks like I laid more
traps than you expected

395
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:29,025
me to.

396
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:31,483
I was hoping I'd get
to use this.

397
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:34,025
They take a while to build up,
so this can only work on someone

398
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,775
who's let their guard down.

399
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:37,567
Who knew graviton
panels were handy

400
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,983
in so many different situations?

401
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:42,233
The technology was developed
to make temporary

402
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:44,900
scaffolding for use
at construction sites,

403
00:20:44,983 --> 00:20:46,275
but as you're well aware by now,

404
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:47,858
they can also be
deployed to crush

405
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:50,150
the brittle arms of old men.

406
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:51,858
With all that intense pain,

407
00:20:51,942 --> 00:20:53,567
do you think you'll be able
to defend yourself

408
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,650
against my Mental Out?

409
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:56,483
[GENSEI]
Huh?

410
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:59,525
[laughing]

411
00:21:08,108 --> 00:21:10,442
Wow, you're a terrible girl!

412
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:13,317
To put a helpless,
feeble old man such as myself

413
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,775
through such agony?

414
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:17,317
Though, I would have
to actually have a wrist

415
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,817
in order for you to crush it.

416
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,692
A... prosthetic?

417
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:24,483
[GENSEI]
Didn't I tell you?

418
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:27,692
My experiments have nearly
killed me many times.

419
00:21:27,775 --> 00:21:29,942
My entire body is
basically a showcase

420
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:32,400
for prosthetic
replacement technology.

421
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:34,733
And I was pretty much
able to read your true

422
00:21:34,817 --> 00:21:37,192
intentions prior
to this, anyway.

423
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:44,483
Someone who's
pretending to run away

424
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:47,150
but still has some plan
shows telltale signs

425
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:48,608
of what they're after.

426
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:50,150
I don't let those hints
that they're about

427
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:52,317
to turn the tables go unnoticed.

428
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,567
I'm experienced.

429
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,067
Which is why I can
tell something else

430
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,442
by looking at you now.

431
00:21:59,942 --> 00:22:00,900
You're out.

432
00:22:00,983 --> 00:22:02,358
You have nothing left
up your sleeve

433
00:22:02,442 --> 00:22:05,025
to reverse the situation,
do you?

434
00:22:15,442 --> 00:22:16,483
[GENSEI chuckles]

435
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,942
And now the limiter
unlock code... is mine.

436
00:23:58,692 --> 00:24:00,858
[KUROKO] I should already be
on top of Mitori Kozaku,

437
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:03,025
but I'm having trouble
reaching her.

438
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,858
And something feels
out of place.

439
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:07,900
No matter, I'll still find
her whatever it takes.

440
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:10,567
Huh? Does Shokuho not
have a line this time?
