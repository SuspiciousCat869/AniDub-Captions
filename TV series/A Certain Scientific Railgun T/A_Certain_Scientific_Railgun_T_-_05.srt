00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,525
[MIKOTO]
Uh... Kuroko.

2
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,775
This is a joke.

3
00:00:37,858 --> 00:00:39,858
You're all just trying
to pull my leg, right?

4
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:42,025
No idea what you're
talking about.

5
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,650
[MIKOTO]
Right, Uiharu? Saten?

6
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:47,358
That's weird, why would
she know our names?

7
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:49,275
[UIHARU] I imagine Shirai
must have told her.

8
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:50,442
I didn't.

9
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:52,900
We aren't even acquainted.
I couldn't have.

10
00:00:52,983 --> 00:00:54,317
Listen, I don't know
where you heard about

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,983
the three of us, or who told
you all of our names.

12
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:59,025
But if you need help,
or you're in trouble,

13
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:00,608
I'll hear you out.

14
00:01:00,692 --> 00:01:02,733
I am a member of Judgment.

15
00:01:02,817 --> 00:01:05,150
No. That's okay.

16
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,650
[MIKOTO] You've really
done it now, Shokuho!

17
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:17,317
You've decided to mess
with my friends' heads?

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,733
How dare you!

19
00:01:19,817 --> 00:01:22,192
This goes way beyond
just screwing around!

20
00:01:24,692 --> 00:01:26,692
If I show them Kuroko's
and my dorm room,

21
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:28,317
or some photo albums,

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,483
I should be able to convince
them that their memories

23
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:33,150
are being manipulated.

24
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:35,692
But... Would they even
cooperate with me

25
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:37,442
long enough for that?

26
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:39,608
They see me as a total stranger.

27
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:45,150
I don't want to drag
them into it like this.

we need to start getting ready.

30

[MIKOTO]
What is Shokuho's goal here?

31
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:57,275
And now that she has
me under surveillance,

32
00:01:57,358 --> 00:01:59,025
can I even do anything about it?

33
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:34,108
[AWATSUKI] You're really
in top form today, Kongo.

34
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:35,567
Yeah.

35
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,733
Even the announcers were
complimenting your performance.

[KONGO laughs]

37
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:41,150

[KUROKO]
What was that all about?

40
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:47,400

talk to her a little longer.

41

Did you actually?

42
00:03:48,983 --> 00:03:51,358
Or were you just star struck
from meeting someone famous?

43
00:03:51,442 --> 00:03:52,858
That was so weird.

44
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,317
It felt like she had something
she wanted to tell us.

45

[KONGO]
Is that Shirai?

46
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,733
Saten and Uiharu, too?

47
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:01,275
[SATEN]
Oh, Kongo. Hey, there!

48
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:04,233
[KONGO] It's good to see you
out of the hospital, Shirai.

49
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:06,067
As your replacement
in the festival games,

50
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,025
I've made sure to take first
place as often as possible.

51
00:04:09,108 --> 00:04:11,650
[laughs]

52
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:14,400
Um, why in such a dour mood?

53
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:16,275
You must know there's
a girl they call "Railgun"

54
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,358
who goes to our school, right?

55
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:19,817
Well, we were
just strolling along,

56
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,525
and out of nowhere,
she decided to shout at us.

57
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:24,942
Then she accused us
of playing a joke on her,

58
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:27,775
even though she came up to us!

59
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:29,192
Oh.

60
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:30,775
Anyway, thanks for taking
my place in the festival,

61
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:31,942
and best of luck.

62
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:33,192
[KONGO]
Of course.

63
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:34,067

64
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,233

See you around.

--[AWATSUKI] Yeah.
--Take care.

66
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:42,733
[AWATSUKI]
I'm guessing that she and Misaka

67
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:45,608
are having a fight or something?

68
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:47,983
[WANNAI] They usually get
along so well with each other.

69
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,775
[UIHARU]
Wow, Shirai.

70
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:55,442
I didn't realize you were signed
up for this many events.

71
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:57,317
Huh? Oh, yeah.

72
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,942
And they're all
pair events, too.

73
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:01,442
They are?

74
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:05,733
[RADIO DJ A] Our next paired
event is the Balloon Sandwich!

75
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:07,233
Each team holds
a balloon between them

76
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:08,858
without using their hands,
and races it

77
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,608
to the finish line!

78
00:05:10,692 --> 00:05:13,608
But if the balloon breaks,
that team is disqualified!

79
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:16,275
[MIKOTO] Now really isn't
the time for playing games.

80
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,900
I have to get out of here
somehow and go looking for her.

81
00:05:18,983 --> 00:05:22,192
[KONGO]
Misaka? It's time.

82
00:05:22,275 --> 00:05:24,650
We need to blow up this
balloon soon, so may I?

83
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,358
Oh! Mm-hmm.

84
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:30,608

All right, Sissy, go ahead!

Hold your partner Kuroko in
those beautiful arms!

[MIKOTO]
Hey! Stop it!

88
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:37,525
If the balloon breaks,
we're out, you know!

89
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:39,733
[MIKOTO] She couldn't control
herself, so we didn't get

90
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:42,025
any actual practice in.

91
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,608
[KUROKO] Don't you think
it's kind of inappropriate

92
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:45,483
to shout my name
out to the world?

93
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:50,025
[KONGO] I forgot to mention,
I had no idea

94
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:51,942
that you had a twin sister!

95
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:52,942
[MIKOTO]
Huh?

96
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:55,025
Yesterday,
during Balloon Hunter,

97
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:58,150
that was your sister
who entered, was it not?

98
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,567
Are you serious?
You could tell that wasn't me?

99
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,983
Yes, of course!

100
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,775
I have quite the discerning eye,
if I do say so myself.

101
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:07,400
Plus, there is a subtle
difference in the air

102
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:09,358
you both carry about you.

103

Ugh!

What a despicable,
cruel thing Misaki Shokuho

111
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:27,275
has done to you!

112
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:30,858
Whoa, Kongo!
Turn it down a notch.

113
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:32,900
She kidnapped your sister.

114
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:34,567
And that's to say nothing
of manipulating

115
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,483
your close friends' memories.

116
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:39,067
She is not fit to be
a student at Tokiwadai.

00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:45,108
I know how serious this is,
and I want to help you.

I can go look into your sister.

Can I count on you
to keep the attention

120
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:50,650
of Shokuho's clique off of me?

I'll try.

Sorry for getting you
caught up in all this.

123

Listen.

124
00:06:55,942 --> 00:06:58,025
Whatever you do,
don't get in over your head.

125
00:06:58,108 --> 00:06:59,983
The scary thing about this
is that we don't know

126
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:01,275
what she's thinking.

127
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:03,067
If you can find me
a strong enough lead,

128
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,942
I can handle the rest by myself.

129
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:09,192
Hold on.

130
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:11,650
You shouldn't trust
any info given to you.

Even if it's coming from me.

Wait, why not?

133
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:18,525
[KONGO] Because Misaki Shokuho
could have already

134
00:07:18,608 --> 00:07:22,358
brainwashed me by the time
I report back to you.

135
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,400
Any information I give you
could be leading you

136
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:26,567
straight into a trap.

137
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,775
You must plan around
that very real possibility.

crushing seed of distrust.

But don't worry, Misaka.

142
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:39,317
I will bring you
not information,

143
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,817
but your sister herself.

144
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:44,900
I hate to do this after
telling you not to trust me,

Oh. Thank you.

[KONGO] She could have easily
turned Shirai and the others

151
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,983
directly against Misaka,
but didn't.

152
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,775
Which means she must
not have seen a need to.

153
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:08,900
If her goal revolves
around the sister,

154
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:11,983
then this was likely just
to buy her some time.

155
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:14,192
She only hopes to keep
Misaka away from her

until she fulfills her plan.

Don't do anything crazy, Kongo.

160
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:41,442
This isn't your problem.

161
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:43,900
So please don't get
hurt for my sake.

162
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:44,942
[HOKAZE]
Misaka?

163
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:47,900
Your cell phone.

164
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:49,983
[MIKOTO]
Oh, no. Is she onto me?

165
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:51,692
That's the "Lovely Mitten
Gekota" model,

166
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:53,067
if I'm not mistaken.

167
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,067
[MIKOTO]
Huh? Yeah, it is.

168
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,317
[gasps]

169
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,275
It so happens I have one, too.

170
00:08:58,358 --> 00:08:59,775
[MIKOTO]
Pyonko?!

171
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:02,025
[HOKAZE] I saw the Gekota
strap you have on your bag,

172
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,358
and I have been wondering
if you were into them since.

173
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:06,692
[MIKOTO]
So that's why.

174
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:08,192
My, isn't this nice?

175
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:10,025
I've always wanted to sit
down and have a nice,

176
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:11,775
long chat with you.

177
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:14,400
I wish they weren't labeled
as being for children.

178
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:16,233
It makes things so awkward.

179
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:18,275
I get funny looks around
town from mothers

180
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,608
with their children.

181
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,525
[MIKOTO]
Yeah, I know what you mean.

182
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:23,525
My dorm rules keep me
from lining up early

183
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:25,567
on the day new merch
comes out, too.

184
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,983
[HOKAZE]
Speaking of new releases,

185
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,233
you know the regional series
that just went on sale?

186
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:31,692
Total slap in the face
for us Gekoers, right?

187
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:32,858
[MIKOTO]
Thank you!

188
00:09:32,942 --> 00:09:35,108
They completely ignored
established canon!

189
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:38,650
[KOBAYASHI] This is all
going way over my head.

190
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:41,108
[MIKOTO] Aw, I still haven't
gotten my hands on one.

191
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:44,317
I keep checking online
auction sites, but no luck.

192
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,525
[HOKAZE] Well as it turns out,
I have two of them.

193
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:48,442
One to play with,
and one that I keep safe

194
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:50,067
for my collection.

195
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,942
--You have two?!
--Sure do.

196

Tell you what, if you try your
hardest in your events today,

197
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:57,358
I'll give you the
one I'm saving.

198
00:09:57,442 --> 00:09:58,817
What? Really?

199
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:02,567
[MIKOTO]
Talk about an elaborate trap!

200
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:07,525
[BABA]
I'm telling you.

201
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:11,192
Mikoto Misaka has
definitely been neutralized.

202
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:13,275
I injected her with
the nanodevice;

203
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:15,358
there's no way she can move.

204
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:18,567
Besides, securing her
is your job, isn't it?

205
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:22,400
Are you absolutely sure she
wasn't just taken to a hospital?

206
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:25,483
[KOZAKU] Well, I won't
worry about that for now.

207
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:29,025
Baba, I have another job
that I'd like you to do.

208
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:30,442
[BABA]
Another?

209
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:34,650
[KOZAKU] Your target will be
Mikoto Misaka's clones.

210
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:35,692
The Sisters.

211
00:10:38,483 --> 00:10:40,525
[KONGO] According to what
Misaka told me,

212
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:42,233
this is the location
where she and her sister

213
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:44,192
last saw each other.

214
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:46,775
So it's likely she came
into contact with Shokuho

215
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:49,317
somewhere nearby.

216
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,983
But there's something
off about this.

217
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,900
Misaka's sister isn't
as powerful as she is,

218
00:10:54,983 --> 00:10:58,275
so she shouldn't be able
to avoid Mental Out.

219
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,983
Shokuho could have just
used her ability to order

220
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:03,692
her target to go wherever
she wanted her to.

221
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:05,525
So why did she go
through the extra effort

222
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:08,400
of capturing and relocating her?

223
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:10,067
What if it wasn't her ability,

224
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,108
but something else that caused
Misaka's sister to faint?

225
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:15,233
Perhaps Shokuho had
nothing to do with that.

226
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,525
If that is true, then there
may be a clue around here.

227
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:28,400
Is that... the character
Misaka likes so much?

228
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:29,525
Kerozo?

Hey.

Huh? Does it?

Well, I'm not 100% sure,
but yeah, I think so.

252
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,108
It looks just like the cat
I took care of for her

Wait, Balloon Hunter?

255
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,567
Then wouldn't that mean
the cat is Misaka's sister's?

Did you just say
Misaka has a sister?

to go into much detail

Yes.

315
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:51,608
Well, I guess it doesn't matter.

316
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:54,983
See, I was asked to protect
this "sister" of hers myself,

317
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:56,942
so you're not the only
one looking out for her.

318
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:01,067
If you wouldn't mind,
I think it'd be smart

319
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,275
to pool our
information together.

320
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:05,692
[KONGO] While I appreciate
your offer, the fact is

321
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:07,817
I don't know who you
are or your motives

322
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,358
for seeking Misaka's sister.

323
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,650
And without those,
I can't trust you.

324
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:13,942
Explain yourself first,
then we'll talk.

325
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:18,983
[BABA] Yeah, that's about
what I expected. But...

326
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:21,317
I'd suggest we skip that
and jump straight to the part

327
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,150
where you tell me all about
that lead you've found.

328
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:25,400
Because if you don't...

[KONGO gasps]

[KONGO]
A robot?!

331
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,358
I'll just end up using
my special drugs

332
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:34,108
to force it out of you anyway.

333
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:36,942
I would advise you
to keep your distance!

334
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:39,442
I was extremely suspicious
from the start,

335
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:42,192
so naturally I assumed he
was working with Shokuho.

336
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,650
But if he doesn't know
where Misaka's sister is,

337
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:46,983
then perhaps not.

338
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:49,067
I tagged along,
thinking maybe I could get

339
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,192
some information out of him.

340
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:53,900
But regardless,
it does not change the fact...

341
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,442
...that he is Misaka's enemy.

Aww! It's so cute!

to get out of here, and soon.

And now I can't get down!

352
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:32,067
[MIKOTO] There! That was just
an unfortunate accident,

353

so they can't blame me!

wait for us at the next stop;

with her and she's safe.

I'm dealing with people

[KONGO gasps]

00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:03,108
You're not getting away.

370
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:04,650
I made sure to look
into your ability

371
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,483
after one of your events.

372
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,650
I know you can create
air jets on objects

373
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:11,275
and propel them forward.

374
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:13,608
But then, there's nothing
here for you to use

375
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:15,358
that ability on.

376
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:18,192
Which is exactly why
I led you to this spot.

377
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:20,358
If you just give up and tell
me what I want to know,

378
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:23,275
you'll save yourself
a lot of pain.

What?!

00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:33,067
[KONGO] I regret to inform
you that you've made

382
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,608
two miscalculations regarding
my ability, Aero Hand.

383
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:40,358
First of all, you assumed
I had limitations

384
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:42,400
on where I can place my jets.

385
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:44,233
[BABA] You can just put
them on the ground?

386
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:47,233
And your second mistake...

387
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,942
[BABA]
The parabolic antenna?!

388
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:58,733
[KONGO] ...is that you failed to
realize I can gather my jets

389
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:01,108
for a massive output that
can launch heavy equipment

390
00:18:01,192 --> 00:18:02,567
into the stratosphere!

391
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,067
With my power, I can send
absolutely anything flying!

392
00:18:09,442 --> 00:18:12,400
[KONGO] And I can just pay
for whatever I destroy!

Frankly, I don't see
any other option

394
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,858
but for you to give up.

395
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:20,692
I had no idea her ability
could be this powerful.

Don't bother trying to move.

421
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:30,817
I just injected you with a
nanodevice that deprives you

of control over your body.

have to use it

You're doing this because
Misaka asked you to?

It's funny.

That girl said she's here
on behalf of Mikoto Misaka.

468

And the fact that she's
doing this for no gain

469
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:42,692
makes her second-rate.

even get the job done,

00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:47,858
I'd say in reality,
she's lower than third-rate.

472
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:49,400
Truly human trash.

473
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:50,608
Shut your mouth!

474
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:57,233
[WANNAI] Saten, I'm sorry
to ask this of you,

475
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,483
but could you take
Kongo and that cat

476
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,608
and move them to
someplace safe for us?

477
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,108
But...

478
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,233
[AWATSUKI]
If we don't keep that cat safe,

479
00:22:09,317 --> 00:22:12,400
everything Kongo's done
will have been for nothing.

480
00:22:14,525 --> 00:22:15,608
[WANNAI]
Besides...

481
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:21,400
...I know you're angry.

482
00:22:21,483 --> 00:22:24,692
[AWATSUKI] But you're
not the only one here...

483
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:26,900
...who's utterly
furious right now.

484
00:23:58,358 --> 00:23:59,817
[WANNAI]
Awatsuki.

485
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,900
This is the first time I've ever
felt such a strong instinct

486
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,983
--to fight!
--[AWATSUKI] Me too, Wannai.

487
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,608
I think we need to have
a word with that boy

488
00:24:05,692 --> 00:24:07,275
who disrespected Kongo!

489
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:08,650
[WANNAI]
Let's go!

490
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,567
[BOTH] For a high-schooler,
you have the vocabulary

491
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,983
of a middle-schooler!
