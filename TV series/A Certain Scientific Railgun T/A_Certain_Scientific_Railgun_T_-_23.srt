1
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,078
[LEADER] You have got to
be kidding me with this.

2
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,080
The third‐ranked
Level 5 is here now?

3
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,165
This is the worst
possible scenario!

4
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,583
How unlucky can we get?

5
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,585
You wouldn't happen to
be some organization

6
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,462
that's up to no good, would you?

7
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,713
[LEADER]
Calm down.

8
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,049
I haven't heard of any rival
groups who are after the results

9
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,968
of the Doppelganger research.

10
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,636
This is risky,
since we don't know

11
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,222
the reason she was
fighting Seike, but...

12
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,933
[LEADER] Hold on.
We're a recovery team.

13
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,394
We've been formally hired to
retrieve the Doppelganger

14
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,272
by the research institution
that owns and developed it.

15
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,940
I admit, in all likelihood,

16
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,693
the person you fought was
one of our team members.

17
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,236
But I hope you understand that

18
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,737
due to the nature
of our mission,

19
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,406
we're under mandatory
orders to stop

20
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,575
any outsiders
from getting involved.

21
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,076
I don't know why you're here,

22
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:17,786
but if your goals
don't conflict with ours,

23
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,580
maybe we can join forces!

24
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,706
Huh?!

25
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,416
[LEADER]
Sorry about this, Seike,

26
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,459
but your revenge
will have to wait.

27
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,337
This might be our last chance
to complete our mission.

28
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,965
[LEADER] I understand that you
probably can't trust us yet,

29
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,342
but I'm willing to share our
information with you first.

30
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,094
How does that sound?

31
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,554
It sounds confusing.

32
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,307
Was the job too much for you
to handle alone or something?

33
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,766
[LEADER]
Yes, unfortunately.

34
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,436
That thing has more abilities
than we were told about.

35
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,813
When it gets damaged, it
controls the matter around it,

36
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,565
incorporating it into itself.

37
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,774
Wait, what?

38
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,818
Does that mean you guys
hurt the Doppelganger?

39
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,153
[LEADER gasps]

40
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,322
[LEADER] Is she implying that
a legitimate recovery team

41
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,157
couldn't possibly
damage their target?

42
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,450
Is that it?

43
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,868
Not good. What do I say‐‐?

44
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,786
We were surprised
she was hurt, too.

45
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,455
I wish I could tell you
how it happened,

46
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,874
but she was like that
when we ran into her.

47
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,083
[LEADER]
That's my girl.

48
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,544
[YAKUMARU] I got you. How long
have we been working together?

49
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,630
I can pick up what
you're puttin' down.

50
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,090
[NARU] Hm? What are you
two talking about?

51
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,968
We were the ones who broke
that thing, you big dummies.

52
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,095
[LEADER, YAKUMARU] Too bad
we have this idiot with us.

53
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,556
Ah! I can't believe I
forgot to bandage you up!

54
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,642
You must have hit your head
and scrambled your memories.

55
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,018
Isn't that right?

56
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,395
[MIKOTO] Kuriba did mention
the soul diffusing

57
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:26,813
and possessing things.

58
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,191
Does that mean it can
control its surroundings,

59
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,360
while still inhabiting
its own body?

60
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,528
It sounded pretty
unlikely at first,

61
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,989
but now I want
to see for myself.

62
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,158
[LEADER] We may have been
humiliated by the first‐ranked

63
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,743
and demoted to grunt work,

64
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,953
but now that we've got
the third‐ranked here,

65
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,955
she's gonna help us bounce back.

66
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,469
[NARU]
Hey, Seike!

67
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,429
I know that we're
in the right area...

68
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,638
[BOTH gasp]

69
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,723
[YAKUMARU]
There!

70
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,351
[NARU] I can't believe
Seike got beaten.

71
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:32,564
I guess that really is Mikoto
Misaka, the Level 5, huh?

72
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,275
[LEADER] I'll stay here.
You two go and get Seike.

73
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,986
Then be on standby
for my instructions.

74
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,822
Leader's hurt, too. What makes
her think it's a good idea

75
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,242
to be alone with that girl?
I'm really worried about her.

76
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,578
[YAKUMARU] I get the feeling
she thinks having you around

77
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,414
would blow our cover.

78
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,541
[LEADER] Here's our
official work request.

79
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,960
Does that answer
all your questions?

80
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,420
If it does, let's go.

81
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,130
Hold on.

82
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,300
I believe you, it does look like
you've been hired to do this,

83
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,886
but if you want the two
of us to work together,

84
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,430
I'm gonna need to know
a little more about you.

85
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,182
[LEADER] While reviewing
our fight with Accelerator,

86
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:11,436
I happened to read some basic
intel on the other Level 5s.

87
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,898
Mikoto Misaka's fought with dark
side organizations before,

88
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,776
but she's never
voluntarily worked with one.

89
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,694
I have to make
a good impression.

90
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,029
More importantly,
I have to keep

91
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,448
that we're a dark side
organization under wraps.

92
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,617
[LEADER]
Oh, like our affiliation?

93
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,411
[LEADER] The most accessible
and trustworthy is...

94
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,955
[LEADER]
I'm with Judgment.

95
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,498
Judgment? You guys?

96
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,210
Call me crazy, but I don't
see an armband anywhere.

97
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,962
[LEADER]
I have it on me, of course.

98
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,339
But since we're not dealing
with a human in this case,

99
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,591
showing our authority
wouldn't do us much good.

100
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,218
We can't "arrest" our target.

101
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,220
[LEADER] Glad I brought
this fake armband.

102
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,763
It's absurd that I'm
pretending to be

103
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,182
a goody‐two‐shoes who
sucks up to teachers.

104
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,350
That's all well and good,

105
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:53,186
but your buddy in the sailor
uniform picked a fight with me.

106
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,939
Which is about as far removed
from Judgment's standard

107
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,607
protocol as I can imagine.

108
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,527
[LEADER] Huh? Seike is
the one who started it?

109
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,987
After promising
never to get involved

110
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,031
with another Level 5
ever again? That little...!

111
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,284
[LEADER] Oh, well,
that kid is a civilian!

112
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,078
It's not uncommon for us to have
cases where we need to turn

113
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,539
to those with powerful
abilities for help, you see.

114
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,624
However, that one has
a particularly bad habit

115
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,252
of picking fights
with strong people.

116
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,213
[LEADER]
That was a hell of a stretch.

117
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,924
[MIKOTO]
Oh, yeah? That makes sense.

118
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,342
[MIKOTO]
Every time I stick my nose

119
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,344
into Kuroko's
Judgment business...

120
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,014
Sissy, need I remind you
that you're a civilian?

121
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,599
[MIKOTO]
...is all I ever hear.

122
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,852
I guess it's more
common than I realized.

123
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,230
[MIKOTO] That being said, that
"civilian" was way out of line.

124
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,734
Probably not a good ally to have
on dangerous missions like this.

125
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,987
[LEADER]
Y‐Yeah. I'll be more careful.

126
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,323
[LEADER] I kind of can't
believe I pulled that off.

127
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,157
[MIKOTO]
Hm?

128
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,159
‐‐[LEADER] Okay then.
‐‐[phone vibrates]

129
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,161
Sorry, one second.

130
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,872
Did you manage to find
little miss Kuriba yet?

131
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,749
Shokuho? You have my number?

132
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,253
[LEADER] Shokuho? Misaki
Shokuho? Another Level 5?

133
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,005
[LEADER] What did I expect?
The third‐ranked

134
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,757
and fifth‐ranked go
to the same school!

135
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,468
Naturally the two Level 5s
would know each other!

136
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,220
Yeah, I ran into her
not long ago, actually,

137
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,639
but right before I found her,

138
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,682
she had a run‐in
with the Doppelganger.

139
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,185
So naturally, now I'm
trying to track it down.

140
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,063
[SHOKUHO] I could always use
my powers to help you find it.

141
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,066
[MIKOTO] And drag more innocent
people into this? No thank you.

142
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,525
[SHOKUHO]
Well, okay then.

143
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,153
Maybe I should meet up
with you myself, instead.

144
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,237
Where are you?

145
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,074
The redevelopment district
behind the airport bus terminal.

146
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,533
Do you know how to get there?

147
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,535
[LEADER] Don't tell me
she's coming here, too!

148
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,080
This is bad! This is really bad!

149
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,374
The fifth‐ranked is a
mental ability esper!

150
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,793
She'll know I'm lying
without a single word!

151
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,253
[LEADER]
Um! That won't be necessary!

152
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,339
My ability is a searching type.

153
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,424
It'll be more than enough
to track someone down.

154
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,052
In fact, if a mental
manipulator esper is around,

155
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,887
the interference makes
my sensitivity drop!

156
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,598
[LEADER] I was hoping to
keep my ability a secret!

157
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,934
[SHOKUHO] I thought I heard
a voice. Is someone with you?

158
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,812
Yeah. Someone from
Judgment's helping me.

159
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,897
[SHOKUHO]
Judgment, really?

160
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,358
Well, whatever.
Oh, and while I have you,

161
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,818
let me tell you
about this other lead

162
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,611
I forgot to mention earlier.

163
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,405
It's a juicy little
secret about the folks

164
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,241
in the high‐rise the
Doppelganger escaped from.

165
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,492
What is it?

166
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,828
Institutions that
perform shady research

167
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,580
tend to back up their data in
highly classified locations,

168
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,624
and this one is no different.

169
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,419
But whoever picked their
spot has an imagination.

170
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,630
Apparently, their top‐secret
info is up in the skies.

171
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:26,756
[MIKOTO]
The skies?

172
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,009
[SHOKUHO] To more precise,
it's on an airship.

173
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,886
Once per month, it passes
over a designated location,

174
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:36,099
and when it does, they exchange
information with it via laser.

175
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:39,060
But other than that,
its course is entirely random.

176
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,770
Not even the institution is sure

177
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,814
where it's flying
at any given moment.

178
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,942
And apparently, the ship itself
is jam‐packed with masking,

179
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,570
concealment, and
polarizing deception tech.

180
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,446
Huh?

181
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:54,117
So just file that one away,
in case it comes in handy.

182
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,493
[LEADER]
It sounds like the fifth‐ranked

183
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,704
isn't coming anymore.

184
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,707
[LEADER] That was Misaki Shokuho
you were speaking with, right?

185
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,042
Huh? Yeah.

186
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,835
[LEADER] I saw her at
the Daihasei Festival

187
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,170
opening ceremonies.

188
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,797
She's surprisingly mature
for a middle‐schooler.

189
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,925
She's one of Tokiwadai's best,
the other being you of course.

190
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,552
Oh, who can forget
the way she exposed

191
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,970
that scandal with
the governing board?

192
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,305
Very impressive.

193
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,182
But the thing that really
got me was when I found out

194
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,184
she uses her esper power
to transcribe letters

195
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,810
for students with disabilities.

196
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,855
I mean, how could I not
respect her after that?

197
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,440
[LEADER] There.
Complimenting your partner

198
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,151
should make you like me‐‐
Huh? How come?

199
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,820
That isn't the reaction
I was aiming for.

200
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,865
I never would have pegged her as
someone who does charity work.

201
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,784
Is she actually a good person?

202
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,535
‐‐Nah, that's like, impossible.
‐‐[LEADER] Oh, right!

203
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:41,289
We need a way to contact each
other in case of an emergency!

204
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,665
Here, use this.

205
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,168
It may be a toy, but it
has a considerable range,

206
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,462
and it only picks up the
registered user's voice.

207
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,923
So even if there's a lot of
noise, you'll come in clearly.

208
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,509
And since it's made for kids,
it's pretty resilient.

209
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,886
[MIKOTO]
Why this character?

210
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,889
[LEADER gasps] Oh, crap!
She must be at that age

211
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,183
where she hates being
treated like a kid!

212
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,143
What do I do?
Maybe I can play it off

213
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,395
like it was just a
joke or something.

214
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,898
[LEADER]
Uh. I mean...

215
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,816
[LEADER]
No, wait!

216
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,068
I was distracted by
hearing about Shokuho,

217
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,320
and it was hard to see
against the light behind her,

218
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,824
but Mikoto Misaka's cell phone
case must be the same character!

219
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,117
I think!

220
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:17,992
Which is it?

221
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,245
The instincts I developed from
the dark side are telling me

222
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,831
that the next words out of my
mouth could mean life or death!

223
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,542
Which is it?

224
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,919
[LEADER] So, uh...
I'm not really familiar

225
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,838
with this character,
but it's so cute,

226
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,339
I fell in love
with it right away.

227
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,551
I just love it to bits now!

228
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,594
So...

229
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,513
[LEADER gasps]

230
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,806
Heh.

231
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,058
You've got some really good
taste, I'll give you that!

232
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,479
[LEADER]
Safe! I think I peed a little.

233
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,107
Okay, let's get a move on.

234
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,776
Here we come, Doppelganger.

235
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,959
[LEADER]
Over there.

236
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,816
[LEADER]
Whoa. Did you crush it?

237
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,819
No, I just trapped her
inside a concrete cage.

238
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:39,365
[LEADER] Level 5. That's some
incredible power, all right.

239
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,034
[gasps] Get back!

240
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,493
[LEADER gasps]

241
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,370
This isn't a fun surprise.

242
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,331
I thought it could only
affect materials around it

243
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,542
when it's damaged. Guess
that intel's out of date.

244
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,051
[MIKOTO] Wow. And it repelled
my attack with more power

245
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,221
than I initially
put into it, too.

246
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,514
Is it that soul
possession thing?

247
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,849
It does seem like its‐‐

248
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,517
or maybe I should
start saying her

249
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,062
will has an effect on
the things around her.

250
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,735
[gasping]

251
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:16,611
[LEADER gasps]

252
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,820
Uh‐oh!

253
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,280
[LEADER grunts, yelps]

254
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,166
[DOPPEL] Ever since we passed
each other at the facility,

255
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,002
I thought we might end up
fighting at some point.

256
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,630
But that will just
have to wait until

257
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,883
I've advanced a few
more stages, Railgun.

258
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,802
[LEADER]
Thanks a lot, you saved me.

259
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,345
I mean, of course I did.

260
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,306
You're the one who asked me
about joining forces, remember?

261
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,476
And I would have done that
even if we weren't teamed up.

262
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,477
We lucked out though.

263
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,480
If that tank she threw at us had
more fuel left, we'd be done.

264
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,066
Although, all the plans
I had to tie her up

265
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,819
just got thrown out the window.

266
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,404
[LEADER]
This is getting ridiculous.

267
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,323
Even a level 5 has her
hands full with this.

268
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,201
Anyway, let's get after her.
Do you know which way she went?

269
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,538
[LEADER gasps]
No, but gimme a sec.

270
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,165
There. It's moving
north‐northeast.

271
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,127
If she keeps going that way,
she'll hit a packed dorm area.

272
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,378
Maybe she's trying to hide

273
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,630
by blending in with
the crowd there.

274
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,048
No.

275
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,759
What is that? A radar facility?

276
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,011
Oh, come to think of it,

277
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,972
that airship is carrying all
their top‐secret information.

278
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,015
[SHOKUHO]
Well, yeah.

279
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,100
With all of the equipment
at that facility,

280
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,353
she might be able to remove the
airship's cloaking and find it.

281
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:35,898
[MIKOTO] Okay, but what reason
would she have to do that?

282
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,860
Taking into account everything
Kuriba has told us,

283
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,279
it's possible the airship
may be part of the system

284
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,032
for storing the Doppelganger's
data in some way.

285
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,534
If that is the case,
that could help explain it.

286
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,494
Perhaps blowing up the
airship will allow it

287
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,747
to further "diffuse" its soul.

288
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,415
Whatever the case,
it sounds like

289
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,167
we're better off stopping her.

290
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,711
But once she gets downtown,
the damage will be much worse.

291
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,630
[LEADER] This radar facility‐‐
it's incredibly close

292
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,925
to where we were supposed to
deliver the Doppelganger.

293
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,844
Even if we aren't able
to restrain it yet,

294
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,430
maybe we can change the
direction it's heading in.

295
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,015
Fact is, if it keeps
going straight,

296
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,516
people are going to get hurt.

297
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,560
But if we can lead it
over here, instead,

298
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,104
an area that's mostly
abandoned warehouses,

299
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,814
the only people there
should be Skill Out,

300
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,149
who're using it as their base.

301
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,317
That makes sense.

302
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,652
And if you issue an evacuation
order to Skill Out,

303
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,905
then no one will
have to get hurt.

304
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,989
[LEADER]
Oh, that's right,

305
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,783
I'm supposed to be a
member of Judgment.

306
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,035
Yeah. You got it.
Just leave it to me.

307
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,787
I'll contact you
once that's done.

308
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,164
[MIKOTO]
Great. Counting on you!

309
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,296
Come on, Skill Out?
Who cares about them?

310
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,423
[LEADER] Not me, that's
for sure, but trust me,

311
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,550
it works out in our favor
to get Mikoto Misaka

312
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,802
to go through the route we set.

313
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,011
You can do it.

314
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,221
All right.

315
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,557
She wants us to relocate all
the Skill Outs in this big area?

316
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,143
What, do we smack 'em
around one by one?

317
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,562
Obviously not.
That would take forever.

318
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,731
Plus, if we provoke them,
they might come after us,

319
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,775
which is the opposite
of what we want.

320
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:04,028
But I've got a plan,
so go hide and watch.

321
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,658
[SKILL OUT 23A] Yeah, can you
believe that? So what do I say?

322
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,159
I say, "I wouldn't even care

323
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,911
if you were a Level 5,
you're dead!"

324
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,455
Huh? Hey, it's a chick!

325
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,707
[SKILL OUT 23A]
Yo, really?

326
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,126
It is some girl.

Hey. Do you have any idea
who's territory this is‐‐?

[SKILL OUTS]
She's cute!

332
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,511
[YAKUMARU]
There was an accident.

333
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,555
Some toxic gas leaked out.

334
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,557
And based on the wind,
it's only a matter of time

335
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,559
before it spreads here.
You have to leave now‐‐

[SKILL OUT 23A]
Whoa, whoa. Hold on a sec!

00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,187
That's quite the story
you're tryna feed us!

338
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,188
I know.

339
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,607
The factory plans on
covering it all up!

340
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,859
They don't think
anyone will care

341
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,485
if the only injuries
are to Skill Outs,

342
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,446
especially since you were
squatting here illegally

343
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,781
to begin with.

344
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,741
Did you get hurt, too?

345
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,742
[YAKUMARU]
I'm fine.

346
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,537
But I can't stay, I have to
hurry and tell the others!

347
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,414
Are you kidding me?
You're this injured,

348
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,166
but you're more concerned
about people like us?

349
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,585
Hey. Take it easy, we can
go and tell the others,

350
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,836
you worry about yourself!

00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,256
Yeah. You hurry
and get to safety.

Thank you, guys!

at least it worked.

00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,103
Naru. It's safe to come out now.

357
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,106
See the trick is to act brave
and put others first.

358
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,524
And to look just
miserable enough

359
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,568
that it doesn't compromise
your cuteness.

They didn't stand a chance.

All right, which one
of you hurt my Yakku?

I'm gonna wreck you!

I was pretending!

Let's pull this
a few more times.

365
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,661
Having multiple witnesses
lends credibility.

366
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,331
Plus, word will spread faster.

367
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,166
[LEADER]
Evacuation complete.

368

There isn't a single person
along the route we discussed.

Make sure you guide
it through here.

[DOPPEL] She's being provided
with my location.

Is it that girl in the mask?

I knew I should have
eliminated her sooner.

376
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,654
This is oddly familiar.

I fought something like you
at the end of summer vacation.

Maybe a friend of yours?

You seem to have neglected
to inform us about this,

aware it can suck in

the objects around it
and control them.

It has no such bug‐‐

[RESEARCHER 21A]
Wait, unless.

398
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,750
[KURIBA] If you're right,
and there is a soul

399
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,461
within the Doppelganger,
there's no telling how the soul

400
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,590
will act if its vessel
ever breaks.

401

[RESEARCHER 21A]
Is this what she meant?

402
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,136
Okay, but what am I
supposed to do with it?

403
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,596
[LEADER]
That's not our problem.

404
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,973
Our mission was simply to
"return the Doppelganger

to the designated location

Oh, and about its current state?

00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,730
Since it's the result of
its original functionality,

00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,066
regardless of how it looks, we
don't consider this abnormal.

No thank you.

[MIKOTO] No matter how
much I bust her up,

462
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,324
she just regenerates
immediately.

463
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,995
That was a close one!

464
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:49,373
But y'know... I'm starting
to get a hang of this.

465
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,917
While my magnetism gets
more powerful the closer

466
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:56,046
I am to the object, she isn't
affected by distance at all.

467
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,052
I can put more force behind
something like these steel

468
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,598
beams, but she can put more
force behind the concrete.

469
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,266
Maybe because I can
only affect the

470
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,101
iron components of something,

471
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,061
while she can apparently
exert her influence

472
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,230
over all sorts of matter.

473
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,734
[MIKOTO]
Also...

474
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:23,699
[MIKOTO] Whatever pieces of her
I burn char up and crumble away.

475
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,494
So much for mysterious
"soul possession."

476
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,580
Not so scary once I
figure out how it works.

477
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:33,042
[DOPPEL] Analyzing in the
middle of a large‐scale fight.

478
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:37,880
You're a lot more trouble
than I expected, Railgun.

479
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,632
In that case...

480
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,434
[CHIEF RESEARCHER]
Soul possession?

481
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:54,230
Ah. That thing Kuriba was
talking about, right?

482
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,565
The whole thing's
absurd if you ask me.

483
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:57,858
I understand that,

484
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,195
but how else can you
explain what's happening?

485
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,531
Hello? Are you there?

486
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,200
[CHIEF RESEARCHER groaning]

487
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,623
[MIKOTO gasping]

488
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:16,293
[DOPPEL]
You can't burn all of this away.

489
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,838
Nor can you break it all apart.

490
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:28,430
[DOPPEL] When faced with such
an overwhelming amount of mass,

491
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,558
what will you do?

492
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,278
[MIKOTO] The soul diffuses
and possesses stuff?

493
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,073
And that's what that colossal
monster‐y thing is?

494
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,866
Honestly, I still don't buy it.

495
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,159
[SHOKUHO]
Well, people tend to believe in

496
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,369
what they want to believe in.

497
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,121
Like an Indian Poker card that
makes your bust grow bigger.

498
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,915
[MIKOTO]
Will you stop bringing that up?
