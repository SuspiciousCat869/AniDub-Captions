All right. That's it for today.

Third-years, you can go now.

First-years, you're dismissed
after everything is put away.

4
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:55,400
[HOKAZE]
Oh. Hi, Misaka. Pleasant day.

5
00:00:55,483 --> 00:00:57,317
Uh... Yeah.

6
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,567
[MIKOTO]
Who is that?

7
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,525
[HOKAZE] I guess I never
properly introduced myself.

8
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:06,608
Junko Hokaze, third-year.

9
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,275
[MIKOTO]
From the Shokuho clique.

10
00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:10,483
[HOKAZE] If I'm not mistaken, we
haven't had a chance to speak

11
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:12,817
since the Daihasei Festival.

12
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,483
Anyway, down to business.

13
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:17,233
There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

14
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:20,150
You know the pair contract strap
from Handy Antenna Service?

15
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:22,108
I'm sure a fellow Gekoer
like yourself knows

16
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:23,817
how elusive it is.

17
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,692
Since a girl can't
get it by herself,

18
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:27,025
what's your strategy?

19
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:29,900
Uh, not sure. I'll probably--

20
00:01:29,983 --> 00:01:33,317
[SHOKUHO] My, my.
Look at you two, hitting it off.

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,483
It's pretty bold of you
to flirt with one of my girls

22
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:37,275
out in the open like this.

23
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:38,650
Oh, my Queen!

24
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,608
I'm sorry, are you saying
we can't make small talk

25
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:42,275
without your permission?

26
00:01:42,358 --> 00:01:45,942
Also, based on your
clothes, did you cut class?

27
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:48,108
[SHOKUHO] There are legitimate
reasons for a young woman

28
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:49,775
to sit out of phys ed, you know.

29
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:51,608
[MIKOTO]
But you do it constantly.

30
00:01:51,692 --> 00:01:53,442
There's always an excuse
up your sleeve,

31
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:55,900
but you just don't know
how to swim, do you?

32
00:01:58,317 --> 00:01:59,608
What was it again?

33
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:02,442
"Unless you're ready to
kill me right here and now,

34
00:02:02,525 --> 00:02:03,525
then move"?

35
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:04,942
[MIKOTO gasps]

36
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,067
I can't believe you had
to use the bathroom that bad!

37
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,317
That was something you
completely made up!

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,650
[SHOKUHO] You really left
the two of them speechless.

39
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:13,567
[MIKOTO] I still can't
believe you did that to me.

40
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,817
[SHOKUHO]
Excuse me?

41
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,775
Don't forget that was
for your benefit, too.

42
00:02:16,858 --> 00:02:19,567
I had a lot of covering up to
do to keep things under wraps.

43
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,483
There were a million other ways
you could've handled that,

44
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:22,858
and you know it!

45
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,525
[SHOKUHO] You should be
thanking me, not blaming me

46
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:26,567
for your personal problems!

47
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,025
You stay out of this!

48
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:30,150
Yes! I'm sorry for interrupting.

49
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,442
[MIKOTO]
I mean, really.

50
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:32,692
You could've just
left that part alone, and...

51
00:02:32,775 --> 00:02:34,067
Uh...

52
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,817
I just remembered I have
somewhere that I have to be.

53
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,442
What, are you running away?
I'm not done with you--

54
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:41,733
For someone who just
finished swimming,

55
00:02:41,817 --> 00:02:43,567
you still have a lot
of energy to spare,

56
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,983
don't you, Misaka?

57
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:47,150
How would you like
to skip lunch and use

58
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,858
some of that energy
to clean the pool?

59
00:02:48,942 --> 00:02:51,608
It could really use it. Hmm?

60
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:52,775
No thank you.

61
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:58,317
If there's one thing she's
good at, it's starting fights.

Misaka? I'm sorry about earlier.

I don't know if this
will make up for it,

64
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:06,733
but I'd like you to have this.

65
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:08,525
[MIKOTO]
Uh... Oh.

66
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:11,192
[HOKAZE] They've become quite
popular in our circle lately.

67
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,150
Huh?

Bye.

[MIKOTO]
What is this?

71
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,692
[SATEN gasps]

72
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:52,692
Awesome, you got an
Indian Poker card!

73
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:54,275
Did you say, "Indian Poker?"

74
00:04:54,358 --> 00:04:55,483
Yeah.

75
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:57,567
Those cards let you see
other people's dreams.

76
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,858
They're not sold in stores;

77
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:00,400
you can find how
to make them online.

78
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:02,275
It's really big right now.

79
00:05:02,358 --> 00:05:04,983
First, the person "providing"
the dream connects themselves

80
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,567
to the card fabricator
and goes to sleep.

81
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,025
Then, the events of
whatever dream they have

82
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:12,525
get recorded onto
a special card.

83
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:14,608
Next, whoever is
"receiving" the dream

84
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:17,525
puts the card on their
forehead and dozes off.

85
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,025
And bam!

86
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:21,442
Apparently, that's all it
takes for the second person

87
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:23,650
to have the same
dream as the first!

88
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:25,067
Huh?

89
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,858
It reacts with your brainwaves
while you're sleeping

90
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:29,317
and emits a faint
electrical signal.

91
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,525
Plus, there are aromatic
compounds inside the card

92
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:33,733
meant to go with the
contents of the dream.

93
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:35,983
[MIKOTO] So it uses both
electricity and smell

94
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:38,650
to reproduce the
provider's dream, huh?

95
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:40,608
[SATEN] Rumor has it that
there are a few rare people

96
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:43,525
out there who can regularly
provide "S-Rank" dreams.

97
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:46,150
Ones that are funny,
or beneficial in some way.

98
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,233
Y'know, dreams that
anyone would want to have.

99
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:50,775
These charismatic people
have been given the title,

100
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:54,567
"Dream Rankers." Or at least,
that's what I've heard.

101
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,692
Apparently, the color and
pattern of the card varies

102
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:58,733
depending on the type
of dream written to it.

103
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:02,275
Orange ones are supposed
to be enjoyable, happy dreams,

104
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:03,692
so no worries!

105
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,108
[MIKOTO] Well, she went
to the trouble to give it to me.

106
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:07,817
If I had the choice,
though, a horror dream

107
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,400
sounds more fun.

108

Ah. That feels delightful.

and altered some memories.

314
00:13:56,692 --> 00:13:58,067
[MIKOTO]
Honestly.

315
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,817
It's not like I can help it
if a person has

316
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,650
that kind of dream on their own.

317
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:03,608
But I draw the line at
distributing those dreams

318
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:05,900
and making it into
a public spectacle.

319
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:07,650
There's no shame in
having pleasant dreams

320
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:09,150
about the object
of your affection.

321
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:10,983
That's unavoidable
in your youth.

322
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:13,192
But to traffic them in
back-alley deals like that

323
00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:14,525
is just gross.

324
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:16,275
Um, okay.

325
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:17,692
I take it that means
you two have dreams

326
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,983
about the gentlemen you're
interested in, then?

327
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:23,067
[SHOKUHO, MIKOTO sigh]

328
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,067
Oh, my.

329
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,483
[SHOKUHO]
Ah, I just remembered.

330
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:28,483
I have a thing I've gotta
go do about a thing. Now.

331
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:29,817
[MIKOTO]
Yeah, same.

332
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,275
I've got something to do,
so I'll see ya later.

333
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:42,067
[UIHARU]
Hey, Shirai. Shirai?

334
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,567
Anyone home? Kuroko Shirai?

335
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,442
Earth to Judgment's resident
reprobate, Kuroko Shirai.

336
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:51,692
[KUROKO]
Huh? What is it?

337
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:53,400
Don't forget we're
out on patrol.

338
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:54,775
Try to keep it together.

339
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:56,692
[KUROKO] What are you
doing with your phone?

340
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:59,650
I'm checking out this app Saten
told me about this morning.

341
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,567
Related, have you
ever heard of those

342
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,233
treasure hunting-type apps?

343
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:04,442
Of course.

344
00:15:04,525 --> 00:15:05,900
It's why students have
been walking around

345
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,483
pointing their phones
at everything lately,

346
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:08,942
if I'm not mistaken.

347
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:10,150
Yeah, I'd say
that's about right.

348
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:12,400
And this app is
pretty similar to those.

349
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:13,983
But when you move
the camera around,

350
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,650
it doesn't show you an in-game
treasure or anything,

351
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:21,108
but the time when an accident
occurred at that location.

352
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:22,983
Someone had a fall
from here this morning,

353
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:24,567
and it's showing up now.

354
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,650
Luckily, it didn't end up
being anything serious,

355
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:28,275
but there's a record of it.

356
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:29,525
While that's interesting,

357
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:31,400
it's not in very
good taste, is it?

358
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:32,525
[UIHARU]
Not at all.

359
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:33,692
And if that were all
there was to this,

360
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:35,025
it'd just be misguided,

361
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:37,192
and wouldn't be worth
looking into much.

362
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:38,358
But apparently,

363
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:40,525
this app also shows
you future accidents

364
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:42,608
that haven't happened yet.

365
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,233
By future accidents,
what exactly do you mean?

366
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:47,608
What it sounds like.

367
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:49,650
There are a lot of locations
marked in the app,

368
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:51,233
and some of them
list times and dates

369
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,650
that haven't happened yet.

370
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:53,650
And then sure enough,

371
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:55,275
at the designated
time and place,

372
00:15:55,358 --> 00:15:57,650
accidents, muggings,
all sorts of bad things

373
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,400
actually happen.

374
00:15:59,483 --> 00:16:02,692
As far I know, no one's
staked out the locations yet,

375
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,400
but reports confirm
the incidents,

376
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:05,983
and the data turns
out to be correct,

377
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:08,442
even though it was
written way ahead of time.

378
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:09,900
Out of all these
"future" accidents,

379
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,442
how many actually occurred?

380
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:13,983
Because if it's one or two,
it could be coincidence.

381
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:16,067
Six incidents out of six.

382
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,025
One hundred percent.

383
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:21,067
So what conclusion
can we draw from this?

384
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,192
That someone with clairvoyance
helped create this app?

385
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,733
[UIHARU] That, or what people
are saying online.

386
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:28,983
They think a person,
or even a group of people

387
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:31,442
are taking the times
and locations from the app

388
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,400
and going out and causing
trouble themselves

389
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:35,400
so that the predictions
all come true.

390
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:37,400
Probably for kicks.

391
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:39,025
But I couldn't find any
connections between

392
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:43,025
the suspects of those incidents,
so that theory isn't very sound.

393
00:16:43,108 --> 00:16:46,067
Plus, a suspicious fire broke
out in a School District 17

394
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,733
factory yesterday afternoon,

395
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:49,983
and there was a purse
snatching in District 16

396
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:51,317
in the evening.

397
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,483
Neither of those were recorded,
so there might be

398
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,233
some sort of rule
for what is and isn't

399
00:16:55,317 --> 00:16:57,650
added to the app.

400
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,942
Well, fine.
Looks like we can't ignore this,

401
00:17:00,025 --> 00:17:03,317
so we'll just have to conduct
a proper investigation.

402
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,900
Let's go find some of
this "foretold trouble."

403
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,025
[KUROKO] Well that was
surprisingly easy, huh?

404
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:13,192
[UIHARU]
The incident is in 15 minutes.

405
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:15,525
Does it happen in front
of these vending machines?

406
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:17,275
Considering this is
the side of the road,

407
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:19,567
it is likely to be
a traffic accident.

408
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,942
If we had proof this
app was the real deal,

409
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:24,317
our first move would be
to close this road off.

410
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,025
Yeah, but we would
never get that authorized

411
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:28,108
without some solid evidence.

412
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:30,108
And if it's a crime rather
than an accident,

413
00:17:30,192 --> 00:17:32,650
it might just happen
a road over.

414
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:34,567
I guess we have
little choice, then.

415
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,275
Let's go observe from
a spot where we can see

416
00:17:36,358 --> 00:17:37,858
the entire road.

Can I assume that you are
the precognitive esper?

470
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:01,192
[KUROKO]
A grade-schooler?

471
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:03,400
To be fair, you could
just be a bystander

472
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:05,317
who uses the app,
but we can figure that out

473
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,483
easily enough--

474
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,817
It's fine.
You don't need to do anything.

475
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,650
Your first guess was right.
I'm the creator of the app.

476
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,692
Don't worry, I won't run.

477
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:15,358
I had planned on making
contact with you

478
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:17,067
sooner or later, anyway.

479
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:22,275
[KUROKO] Shaei Miyama.
4th-year at Matsuume Elementary.

480
00:20:22,358 --> 00:20:24,942
Age 10. Precognitive esper.

481
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:28,317
Yeah. I use this instant
camera for my power.

482
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,525
Which is psychic photography
that sees future events.

483
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:32,442
Right?

484
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:33,650
Yeah, pretty much.

485
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,275
But what shows up
is a marble pattern

486
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:37,650
that's impossible to understand.

487
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:39,775
But by running it through a
special machine they have

488
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:43,192
at the research facility, you
can make out a hazy image.

489
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:47,150
Although, it's only ever
pictures of tragedies.

490
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:49,400
And on top of that,
it only predicts accidents

491
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:51,608
in the near future.

492
00:20:51,692 --> 00:20:54,442
But that much is written
in the Bank, right?

493
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:55,608
What does that mean?

494
00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:57,192
There's more. Think about it.

495
00:20:57,275 --> 00:20:58,983
What we've seen from
the app wouldn't be possible

496
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:01,192
with a hazy image alone.

497
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:02,483
Yeah.

498
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:04,067
I'm not sure if I should
call it a "second stage"

499
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,317
or something, but if
I focus my consciousness

500
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,275
to an even higher level,

501
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:10,692
I can make photos with
additional information.

502
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:12,858
It's just the time and
location of the tragedy,

503
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:14,650
but it's much more concrete.

504
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,108
Information?

505
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,317
[MIYAMA] The app was
originally created by a company

506
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,608
as an analytic tool for
psychic photography espers.

507
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:22,942
Based on the user,

508
00:21:23,025 --> 00:21:25,775
It could do a lot,
like find lost items, or people.

509
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:27,567
But when I run my
"second stage" photos

510
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,400
through the app,
the analyzed data

511
00:21:29,483 --> 00:21:31,192
is displayed on the map.

512
00:21:31,275 --> 00:21:33,150
So you're circumventing
the research facility

513
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:35,317
and using the app
to decode your photos?

514
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,733
I suppose there's
no harm in that,

515
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:39,025
as long as you're getting
the information quicker.

516
00:21:40,525 --> 00:21:42,525
[MIYAMA]
I have a request of you two.

517
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:44,858
Um, ribbon girl and flower girl.

518
00:21:44,942 --> 00:21:46,192
I'm Kuroko Shirai.

519
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:47,733
Kazari Uiharu.

520
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:50,067
[MIYAMA] Shirai and Uiharu,
could you keep my second stage

521
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:50,983
a secret?

522
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:52,192
[KUROKO]
No "Miss"?

523
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:54,067
Why do you want us to do that?

524
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,317
If all you had was the
Bank's description,

525
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,192
you wouldn't think
much of my ability.

526
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,525
[KUROKO] But if people
knew that you could tell

527
00:21:59,608 --> 00:22:01,150
the time and place as well,

528
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:02,483
they might want to
misuse your power,

529
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:04,275
which would put you
in harm's way.

530
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:06,983
Is that what you're
trying to say?

531
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:08,317
[KUROKO]
Very well.

532
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,733
I promise I won't speak
a word of this to anyone.

533
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:12,358
[UIHARU]
Yeah, me either.

534
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:13,775
[MIYAMA]
Thanks.

535
00:22:13,858 --> 00:22:15,858
That being said, even the
secret part of my ability

536
00:22:15,942 --> 00:22:17,483
isn't all that useful.

537
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:21,525
I can be anonymous with the app,
and that's one reason I use it.

538
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:23,358
But there's another.

539
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,317
I wanted to find an esper
who can alter the fate

540
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,608
of the events I predict.

541
00:22:27,692 --> 00:22:29,567
[UIHARU]
Someone who can alter fate?

542
00:22:33,692 --> 00:22:35,608
[SCHOOLGIRL A] Are you sure
about doing this without asking?

543
00:22:35,692 --> 00:22:38,358
[SCHOOLGIRL B]
Yes. We're just making flowers.

544
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,150
Who's gonna get
upset about that?

545
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,400
It'll be fine.

546
00:22:41,483 --> 00:22:43,650
I learned all about it
while I was dreaming.

547
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:00,192
[KUROKO] Use my power
to prevent the incidents

548
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:01,692
that Shaei Miyama predicts?

549
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,275
That's not a bad idea,

550
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,275
but I can't shake the feeling
he's not telling us everything.

551
00:24:05,358 --> 00:24:07,275
[UIHARU] Well, Shirai, you keep
your lasciviousness hidden,

552
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:08,775
don't you?

553
00:24:08,858 --> 00:24:09,983
[KUROKO] I do not keep it
hidden, it's on full display!

554
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:11,942
Wait, what did you just
get me to say, Uiharu?
