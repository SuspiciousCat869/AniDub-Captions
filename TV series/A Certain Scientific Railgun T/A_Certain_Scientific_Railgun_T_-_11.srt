1
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:37,442
[KEITZ]
Is this... the Misaka Network?

2
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:38,442
No.

3
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:39,942
[MIKOTO growls]

4
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:41,775
What happened here?

5
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:43,858
Did you hurt her?!

6
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:45,692
[GENSEI]
Yes, Aleister's favorite,

7
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:48,858
kept hidden within the
shadows of the main plan.

8
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:51,192
What if I were to use this
opportunity and trigger

9
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:54,067
the awakening of your
dormant powers?

10
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,650
I wonder.

11
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,150
[MIKOTO gasps]

12
00:01:14,483 --> 00:01:16,733
[GENSEI]
Now, let the experiment begin.

13
00:01:21,692 --> 00:01:23,067
Let's find out.

14
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,817
Can Misaka reach
the divine world...

15
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,442
...of Level 6?

16
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:35,233
[XÓCHITL] I think their true
objective is Mikoto Misaka.

17
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,525
Wait, what do you mean by that?

18
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:49,400
[KAMIJO]
Hey. Fill me in, too.

19
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,858
[KUROKO]
Really?

20
00:03:38,942 --> 00:03:41,983
So she thinks Misaka
is their true goal, then?

21
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:44,608
[SATEN] Yeah. I don't know
any other details about it,

22
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:47,150
but that's definitely
what she said.

23
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,025
I think Saten's on to something.

24
00:03:49,108 --> 00:03:50,858
There's an electrical
discharge phenomenon

25
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:53,025
occurring in School District 2.

26
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,775
Electrical discharge?

27
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:19,775
[MIKOTO]
Huh? Wait.

28
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,483
What was I just doing?

29
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:26,525
My head feels so groggy
for some reason.

30
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:29,733
For that matter, who even am I?

31
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:32,525
Hey, you.

32
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:34,275
Answer me this,
how is it that you can be

33
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,358
so apathetic about the kind
of things that happen

34
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,817
in this city?

35
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,442
[MIKOTO]
"This city?"

36
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:42,025
You mean in Academy City?

37
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:43,233
What's going on?

38
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,025
[KOZAKU]
You've seen it, right?

39
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:46,233
You know.

40
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:48,650
How they treat clones
as less than human--

41
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,317
No, it's even worse.

42
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,108
Even when dealing
with normal people,

43
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:57,275
they still treat them as
nothing more than lab rats.

44
00:04:57,358 --> 00:05:02,983
The true face of this city
that tramples on human life

45
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:05,317
all in the name of science.

46
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:09,942
[MIKOTO]
Yeah, that's right.

47
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:12,150
I remember.

48
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:13,858
They'll pay.

49
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:16,942
No matter what reasons
they may have had,

50
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:21,733
they've done horrible,
unforgiveable things.

51
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:24,233
Never again.

52
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:26,150
I have to stop them.

53
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:28,483
I have to. I have to.

54
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:31,233
But how?

55
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:35,400
[KOZAKU]
Right over there. That building.

56
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:38,108
The control tower thingy
at the city's center.

57
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:40,567
So long as it exists,
those psychos will do this

58
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,567
over and over.

59
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,317
Another innocent soul
will be hurt again.

60
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,067
Another will be brought
to tears again.

61
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,442
So what do you say?

62
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:54,817
Let's destroy it. Okay?

63
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:04,150
[MIKOTO]
Sounds good.

64
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:25,900
[KOZAKU] Whoa... That was even
crazier than I imagined.

65
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:29,525
It almost made me wet myself.

66
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:31,233
But at least it's done now.

67
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:38,608
It's fine?

68
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:40,608
How is that thing
still even standing?

69
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,983
It doesn't look like there's
been any damage at all!

70
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:44,275
[GENSEI]
Goodness.

71
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:46,733
That may have been a dozen
times more firepower

72
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:49,067
than Misaka can
normally put out,

73
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,025
but she won't leave
a scratch on that building

74
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:54,192
without getting close and
landing a physical blow.

75
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:55,525
That's not what you said--

76
00:06:55,608 --> 00:06:57,858
[GENSEI] You young people
today are so impatient,

77
00:06:57,942 --> 00:06:59,733
it's incredible.

78
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:01,567
You can't expect her
to develop fully

79
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,275
in a matter of minutes.

80
00:07:03,358 --> 00:07:05,233
After seeing that,
I'd say she's about 2%

81
00:07:05,317 --> 00:07:08,483
of the way to Level 6
at the moment.

82
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:10,733
Don't be so hasty, Kozaku.

83
00:07:10,817 --> 00:07:12,108
If you want to
achieve your goal,

84
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:14,317
then you need to perform
your duties properly.

85
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,983
Understand?

86
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,692
Yeah.

87
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:18,942
[GENSEI]
Oh. Right.

88
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:21,650
There's one other thing
I wanted to ask of you.

89
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:22,692
Huh?

90
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:26,817
[ANTISKILL A] It's the board
chairman's building.

91
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,942
It was struck by record-
breaking lightning.

92
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:30,858
Meanwhile in School District 2,

93
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:33,942
there was a massive electrical
discharge phenomenon.

94
00:07:34,025 --> 00:07:35,317
[CHIEF A]
Hmm...

95
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,358
Then let's send rescue
teams and investigators

96
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:38,775
to both sites at once.

97
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,650
[phone rings]

98
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:46,150
Yes? Yes. Right, understood.

99
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,358
All right. I'll--

100
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:48,525
[CHIEF A]
No.

101
00:07:48,608 --> 00:07:49,942
On second thought,
we can't afford to have

102
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:52,400
outsider casualties
during the tournament.

103
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:54,817
Our priority is the
evacuation of tourists

104
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,150
and local residents.

105
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:58,108
[ANTISKILL A] But sir,
that's a different issue--

106
00:07:58,192 --> 00:08:00,025
We'll be closing off both sites.

107
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:02,442
Not a single soul is
allowed to go inside.

108
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,817
Not even Antiskill.

109
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,983
[ANTISKILL A]
Yes sir.

110
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:16,692
Well, even if Antiskill
did head here to help,

111
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:19,608
realistically, they'd just be
adding to the body count.

112
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:22,192
Although, it sure would
be nice to have someone

113
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:25,192
who could hold
her back a little.

114
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:27,442
Oh, my, what do we have here?

115
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:29,692
Out of nowhere,
right when I'm looking for help.

116
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,192
You're coming on
a little strong.

117
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:32,692
If I weren't a part
of this mess,

118
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:34,400
that'd be a major red flag.

119
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:35,817
Okay, I'm in the right area.

120
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,733
[SHOKUHO] But since I am
front and center in all of this,

121
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:42,108
you look more like
a prince to me.

122
00:08:42,192 --> 00:08:44,483
A woman's heart
is a funny thing.

123
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:47,733
Okay. If I go from the top,
I should be able

124
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:50,275
to get the right angle.

125
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:52,650
[KAMIJO panting]

126
00:08:58,317 --> 00:09:00,400
[KAMIJO]
Is that...? Huh?

127
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:04,358
[SHOKUHO]
Hi!

128
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:06,192
Whoa! What is that?

129
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:08,150
It's like it's coming from
the inside of my head!

130
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:10,192
[SHOKUHO] Let me just
say this up front.

131
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:12,900
If you touch your head with
that right hand of yours,

132
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:15,650
you'll erase everything
I'm about to tell you.

133
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,983
--So no touching, okay?
--[KAMIJO] Wha--?

134
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:19,900
Also, unlike a telepath,

135
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:21,733
I'm pretty much just
writing everything

136
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:24,733
into your brain at once, so
don't bother complaining.

137
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:26,108
[KAMIJO]
You what?!

138
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:28,400
[SHOKUHO] I'll try to summarize
this as best as I can.

139
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:30,025
My ability and
the Misaka Network

140
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:34,025
are being used for evil,
and Misaka is in big trouble.

141
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:35,567
[KAMIJO]
So that really is her?

142
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,275
--[SHOKUHO] However...
--Will you listen?!

143
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:38,817
[SHOKUHO] ...if you were
to stick around her

144
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,650
and keep countering
her with your powers

145
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:41,942
of interference,

146
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:44,442
you might be able to
delay her transformation.

147
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:47,942
At least... I think. Maybe.

148
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:49,442
Oh, that's reassuring!

149
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:51,400
[SHOKUHO]
Anyway, I've been thinking.

150
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:53,192
Since brainwashing
shouldn't have any effect

151
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:55,233
on her in her current state,

152
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:57,567
I wonder if they're using
the Network to manipulate

153
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,608
her deep psyche instead.

154
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:01,900
What do you think?

155
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:03,567
[KAMIJO] You couldn't hear
my response anyway.

156
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,317
[SHOKUHO] Well, if you
can touch her directly,

157
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,775
maybe that will turn
her back to normal.

158
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,483
Think of it as a challenge!

159
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,400
I really wish I knew
who you were.

160
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:18,317
A challenge, she says.
Seriously?

161
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,525
Hey! Where's Shirai?

162
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:25,192
Already on her way.

163
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:26,442
Do you think there's
anything I can do

164
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,358
to help out?

165
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:30,233
Thank you for offering.
I'll look.

166
00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:35,775
[SHOKUHO]
There they are.

167
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:38,067
But I don't see Gensei.

168
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,108
Is he planning to keep
out of sight and watch

169
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:41,608
from a safe distance?

170
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:45,483
[SHOKUHO]
Just one second.

171
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:47,150
For all I know, you could
have been ordered

172
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,775
to attack me as soon
as you're freed,

173
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:50,858
so I'll be taking
some precautions.

174
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,608
Let's go with "do me no harm."

175
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,983
Would you mind taking
this girl somewhere?

176
00:10:58,067 --> 00:10:59,442
Preferably safe?

177
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,608
Assuming such
a place even exists.

178
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,067
And you?

179
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,900
[SHOKUHO]
I'm going after Gensei.

180
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:09,192
I mean, if I sent anyone else,
they'd just get brainwashed.

181
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:10,733
The only one who stands
a chance against

182
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:12,108
Mental Out is someone
who can use

183
00:11:12,192 --> 00:11:13,483
Mental Out themselves.

184
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:18,567
[SHOKUHO]
Hey!

185
00:11:28,358 --> 00:11:30,192
[KOZAKU PUPPET] Uh-oh,
that doesn't work on something

186
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:32,275
being remotely
controlled, does it?

187
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:37,108
[KOZAKU PUPPET]
That won't help.

188
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:39,025
I hate to ask, but could
you hang out with me

189
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:40,442
for a bit?

190
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:42,317
Do me a favor and don't fight.

191
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,608
Just behave.

192
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:48,442
Ow.

193
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:49,900
[KUROKO]
I'm with Judgment!

194
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:52,275
It seems the situation
is escalating,

195
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:55,108
and it was already
a public safety concern.

196
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:56,733
I'll need each of you
to explain to me

197
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,692
exactly what's going on.

198
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:01,775
And Mitori Kozaku,
I have even more

199
00:12:01,858 --> 00:12:03,317
to discuss with you.

200
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,858
Starting with the
falsification of Bank data.

201
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:10,317
[SHOKUHO]
Oh, Shirai.

202
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
That was very heroic,
but you must realize

203
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:14,567
you're not questioning
anyone right now.

204
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:20,233
I hate to impose,
but do you think you could

205
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:21,942
prioritize teleporting
the two of them

206
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,442
out of here first?

207
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:26,775
[KUROKO]
Is that Misaka? No.

208
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:30,567
[SHOKUHO gasps]

209
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:35,358
Do you want to go with them?

210
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:37,192
No, but if I could get you
to warp both of us

211
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:39,067
inside the building,
that'd be great.

212
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:46,317
[KOZAKU PUPPET]
Ugh. I gotta admit.

213
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,858
Finding my data in
the Bank in such

214
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:50,525
a short amount of time
is impressive.

215
00:12:50,608 --> 00:12:51,567
Not bad.

216
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,858
[SHOKUHO]
Thank you very much, Shirai.

217
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,317
You saved me.

218
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,108
[KUROKO] Yes, so you can
explain what's going on here.

219
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:02,608
It's only fair to warn you.

220
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:04,817
I don't trust you
even a tiny bit.

221
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,650
You're also under
suspicion for the attack

222
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:09,150
on the 177th Branch Office.

223
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:10,900
We can discuss that
at a later time.

224
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:12,733
But for now,
teaming up would be in both

225
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:15,442
our best interests,
don't you think?

226
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:17,358
There's no need
to be so frightened.

227
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:19,192
I'm just going to send
you my observations

228
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:22,192
about the situation we've
found ourselves in. 'Kay?

229
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:25,525
It'll save me the trouble of
having to say it out loud.

230
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:26,775
[KUROKO groans]

231
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:28,608
[SHOKUHO]
And there you have it.

232
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:29,942
Thank you.

233
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:32,525
[KUROKO]
All right.

234
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:34,525
You're going to explain
all of this later, got it?

235
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:35,900
Good luck out there!

236
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,733
Now then.

237
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:43,025
[STEERING COMMITTEE A]
As you may have noticed,

238
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:44,942
there are massive
cumulonimbus clouds

239
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:48,067
now passing over Academy City.

240
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,858
All outdoor competitions
are being suspended.

241

Further, some competitions
will now be held

at the Dome.

To ensure the safety of
all of our visitors today,

Huh...

Whatever's causin' that
has got some real guts.

247

There's lighting coming
out of the ground.

248
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:10,358
Yeah, think I'll go
take a closer look.

249

[MIKOTO]
Still not enough.

250
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:25,942
To destroy that thing,
I'll need something more.

But it's okay. Pretty soon...

[KAMIJO grunts]

254
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:40,108
[KAMIJO]
I just gotta time this right!

255
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:54,150
[MIKOTO]
What's that?

256
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:55,900
[KOZAKU] It's just a gross
little bug that's trying

257
00:14:55,983 --> 00:14:57,650
to interfere.

258
00:14:57,733 --> 00:15:00,108
You know what we do
with those, right?

259
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,358
Squish them!

260
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:05,025
That figures.

261
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:07,233
I shouldn't have expected
this to be easy.

262
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:15,400
[KUROKO]
That's where Misaka is.

263
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:17,233
[SHOKUHO] They're obviously
looking to control her

264
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:18,775
barbaric strength.

265
00:15:18,858 --> 00:15:20,317
And it's safe to
assume that Mental Out

266
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,817
is an essential
component in that.

267
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,317
As for Kozaku...

268
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,650
My ability has no effect
on her puppets,

269
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:28,400
much to my dismay.

270
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:30,067
So under normal circumstances,

271
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,358
I'd have to assume she's acting
as Gensei's bodyguard.

272
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:35,900
But that's a bit hard
to accept at this stage.

273
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:37,650
I mean, one of the
few pawns he has left

274
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:39,233
should be pushing
his plan forward,

275
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:41,608
not just protecting him, right?

276
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,775
Knowing the crafty old man,

277
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:45,817
I'd bet he'll be making
use of Level Upper

278
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,483
to share Exterior's powers
with her as well.

279
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:50,900
If I had to take a guess,

280
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:55,775
I'd say that her role
is that of an "inductor."

281
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:58,025
I'm not even familiar
with that word.

282
00:15:58,108 --> 00:16:00,358
But somehow I more
or less understand.

283
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:02,567
It's an unsettling feeling.

284
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,983
[SHOKUHO] Based on the precise
movements of her puppets,

285
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:06,525
she can't be too far from here.

286
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:07,858
And if she's controlling Misaka,

287
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:10,150
she can't be far
from her either.

288
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:11,983
That should help
narrow down the search.

289
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:14,942
Please find the puppet master
so we can stop Misaka.

00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:37,775
Thanks, but I just can't
leave her like this.

320
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:39,983
Listen man, I'm not sure
you can handle her.

321
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:41,608
Just get to safety, will ya?

322
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:43,650
I wasn't trying to fight her.

323
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:44,858
From what I've been told,

324
00:17:44,942 --> 00:17:47,108
she's pretty much being
manipulated somehow.

325
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,900
What, so she's not in control?

326
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:51,775
Guess she's lacking
in guts then, huh?

327
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:53,775
I'll just have to knock
some into her!

328
00:17:53,858 --> 00:17:55,733
I kinda doubt that's
a factor here.

329
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:56,983
[SOGIITA]
Why?

330
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:57,900
She probably lost her way
and is acting out

331
00:17:57,983 --> 00:17:59,567
or something. No big deal.

332
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,233
If she had more guts,
she'd be fine.

333
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:02,608
[KAMIJO]
Will you listen to me?!

334
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,775
Wait, he punched
the lightning away?

335
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:16,275
[SOGIITA]
He canceled out the lightning?

336
00:18:16,358 --> 00:18:18,358
[BOTH]
Who is this guy?

337
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:19,608
[SOGIITA]
Heh.

338
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:22,525
I'm Gunha Sogiita. You?

339
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:24,858
[KAMIJO]
Toma Kamijo.

340
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:26,317
[SOGIITA]
All right!

341
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,733
Make sure not to get
in my way, Kamijo!

342
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,067
Right back at ya.

343
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:36,025
[KUROKO] If what Misaki
Shokuho told me is true,

344
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:38,025
then Mitori Kozaku
must be hiding inside

345
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:41,358
a building that's
somewhere near Misaka.

346
00:18:41,442 --> 00:18:43,442
That being said,
this area is packed

347
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:46,192
with research facilities.

348
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:48,608
Finding a single person
in all this will be hard.

349
00:18:51,942 --> 00:18:55,025
I guess I have little choice.

350
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:56,275
Uiharu!

351
00:18:56,358 --> 00:18:58,108
Check the cameras near
the Judgment Building

352
00:18:58,192 --> 00:18:59,400
in School District 2.

353
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:01,400
An 800-meter radius
should suffice.

354
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:03,150
I need you to tell me
if Kozaku shows up

355
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:04,567
on any of them.

356
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,983
Also, I'd like for you to
calculate the blind spots

357
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:09,275
of those cameras
and send them to me.

358
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,192
I'll go check those myself.

359
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,192
You will? All by yourself?
Is that a good idea?

360
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:15,192
You need backup--

361
00:19:15,275 --> 00:19:18,233
[KUROKO]
There is no time for that.

362
00:19:18,317 --> 00:19:19,692
Besides...

363
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:24,692
[MIKOTO]
Besides...

364
00:19:24,775 --> 00:19:26,275
I just had faith in you.

365
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:28,483
I knew I could trust
you to save her.

366
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,692
So that's why.

367
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:36,358
[KUROKO] I'm doing this
as a member of Judgment,

368
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,650
but also because she trusts me.

369
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:41,233
That doesn't feel half bad,
for some reason.

370
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:50,358
[SOGIITA grunts]

371
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,192
Those are some
cool moves you got there.

372
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:55,442
But they're getting old!

373
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:01,025
Hey! Sogii--

374
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:07,025
[KAMIJO]
Is that a barrier of iron sand?

375
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:08,483
That's what that is?

376
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:09,692
What's with her?

377
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,108
Still playin' in
the sandbox like a kid?

378
00:20:12,192 --> 00:20:13,442
That's not gutsy at all.

379
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:14,900
[KAMIJO]
Wha--? Not again.

380
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:16,400
[SOGIITA]
Stand back, Kamijo.

381
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:22,150
[SOGIITA grunts]

382
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:29,525
[SOGIITA yells]

383
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:37,400
[KAMIJO grunts]

384
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:43,733
That right hand of yours
does some awesome stuff,

385
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:44,942
doesn't it?

386
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:47,775
Yeah. I'm thinking if
I touch her with it,

387
00:20:47,858 --> 00:20:49,733
I might be able to
turn her back to normal.

388
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:58,067
[gasps]

389
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:04,025
But I can't find any way
to get close to her

390
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:05,525
like this.

391
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:06,942
You don't say.

392
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:08,358
We can fix that.

393
00:21:09,775 --> 00:21:11,358
[SOGIITA]
'Kay. Leave it to me.

394
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:12,400
[KAMIJO]
Huh?

395
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:29,275
[SOGIITA]
Super Amazing... Punch!

396
00:21:35,525 --> 00:21:37,400
[KAMIJO]
Awesome!

397
00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:38,817
Now's your chance, bud!

398
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,442
No, no, no, no!
Hold on, hold on, wait! Stop!

399
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:42,317
Good luck!

400
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,108
[KAMIJO yells]

401
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:54,067
I'm here, might as well try!

402
00:22:01,108 --> 00:22:02,483
[KAMIJO]
Wait, how do I land?

403
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:03,567
What do I do?!

404
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:14,275
Huh?

405
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:17,942
[footsteps]

406
00:22:22,692 --> 00:22:25,400
[SHOKUHO]
Found you, Gensei Kihara.

407
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,483
[KUROKO] Well, things certainly
have taken a strange turn.

408
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:02,900
I'd like to get some real
answers out of Shokuho,

409
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,442
but at the moment,
Mitori Kozaku comes first.

410
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:07,192
[SHOKUHO] My, how resolute
you are, Shirai.

411
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:08,650
That's a good look on you!

412
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,192
[KUROKO] Do you think you
could refrain from speaking

413
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:11,650
directly into my mind?
