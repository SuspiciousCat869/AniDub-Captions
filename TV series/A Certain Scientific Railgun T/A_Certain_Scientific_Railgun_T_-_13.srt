00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:35,983
[KUROKO] Previously on
<i>A Certain Scientific Railgun T</i> .

2
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:39,192
My name is Kuroko Shirai.
I am a member of Judgment,

3
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:42,608
which works to keep the
peace in Academy City.

4
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:44,817
The city is in the middle
of a large-scale event

5
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,900
known as the Daihasei Festival.

6
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:49,400
During this festival, I was
walking along with my friends

7
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:53,025
Uiharu and Saten, when
suddenly, we were stopped.

8
00:00:53,108 --> 00:00:55,067
It was none other
than Academy City's

9
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,817
third-ranked Level 5, Railgun,

10
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,317
otherwise known
as Mikoto Misaka.

11
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,358
We both attend Tokiwadai,
but we're not even acquainted.

12
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:04,442
Yet she felt comfortable
shouting my name out

13
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:06,067
for all the world to hear!

14
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,358
Who does she think she is?

15
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:11,983
A little later on, Saten
proposed something peculiar.

16
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:14,067
She suggested that
perhaps we were actually

17
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,317
friends of Misaka's,
and close ones at that.

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,942
And that another Level 5
at Tokiwadai Middle School--

19
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:22,192
Mental Out, or Misaki Shokuho--

20
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:24,775
was actually manipulating
our memories.

21
00:01:24,858 --> 00:01:26,317
But that's absurd.

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,150
Could she have come up with
a more ridiculous hypothesis?

23
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:31,400
However, there wasn't
much time to discuss.

24
00:01:31,483 --> 00:01:33,150
At that very moment,
disaster struck

25
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:36,775
and Uiharu and Misaka's
mother were taken hostage.

26
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:40,233
And then, Mikoto Misaka
flashed me a smile.

27
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:43,192
One that suggested she
had complete trust in me.

28
00:01:43,275 --> 00:01:45,317
The image is burned
into my eyes.

29
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,942
Just thinking about it
makes my chest grow warmer.

30
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,567
Uh--! But whatever,
that doesn't matter!

31
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,817
Misaka told us she was
going after Misaki Shokuho,

32
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,233
who apparently knows something
about what was happening,

33
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:57,775
and went on her way.

34
00:01:57,858 --> 00:02:00,692
After she left, Uiharu and I
began an investigation

35
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:03,483
into Mitori Kozaku,
the hostage-taker.

36
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:04,817
While we were gathering intel,

37
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,358
Saten came bursting in
with some new information.

38
00:02:07,442 --> 00:02:10,108
She had gone off on her own
and snuck into a factory,

39
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:12,192
and said she was attacked
by a metal puppet

40
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:14,650
controlled by Mitori Kozaku.

41
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:17,900
Continuing her streak
of reckless behavior!

42
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:20,442
Fortunately for her,
one of Kozaku's associates,

43
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:21,983
a girl by the name of Xóchitl,

44
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:24,983
came to her rescue
for some reason.

45
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:27,483
From what that girl said,
the true target

46
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:32,483
in the plan that Mitori Kozaku
was a part of was Mikoto Misaka.

47
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:34,650
But what did it mean?

48
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,900
Just then, the
skies clouded over

49
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:39,525
and lightning struck
a certain building.

50
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:41,192
On my way to
investigate, I found

51
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:46,067
Kozaku's metal puppet attacking
Misaki Shokuho on a rooftop.

52
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,525
I took the man who was there,

53
00:02:47,608 --> 00:02:51,525
along with a girl who resembled
Misaka, to a safe place.

54
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:53,525
I also rescued Shokuho.

55
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:55,983
But when I tried to ask
her what was going on,

56
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:58,442
and in what way she and
Mikoto Misaka were involved

57
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:00,858
in the increasingly
complex situation,

58
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:02,525
she forwent regular speech,

59
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:05,442
and instead used her ability
to transmit the information

60
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:07,733
directly into my brain.

61
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:10,067
According to it, the
ringleader behind the plan

62
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,275
was a mad scientist
named Gensei Kihara.

63
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:15,858
He had taken control of a
giant facility that housed

64
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:18,567
what is known as "Exterior,"
which allowed him to use the

65
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,525
same ability that Shokuho
has, and was apparently

66
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:25,650
using its power to propel
Misaka to Level 6.

67
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:29,025
To use Shokuho's words,
Mitori Kozaku is an inductor

68
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,650
that will help lead
Misaka to Level 6.

69
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:34,400
So if I take those
words as truth,

70
00:03:34,483 --> 00:03:39,150
an important element in stopping
Misaka is to neutralize her.

71
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:41,608
Incidentally, as Shokuho
is the only person

72
00:03:41,692 --> 00:03:43,942
who knows Exterior's
limiter unlock code,

73
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:47,400
she anticipated Gensei Kihara
tracking her down to learn it,

74
00:03:47,483 --> 00:03:50,317
and laid all kinds
of traps for him.

75
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,150
I really hope that
works out for her.

76
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,317
Beyond that, there are
a couple of boys outside

77
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,442
causing a commotion
themselves.

78
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:01,067
Perhaps they're trying
to stop the runaway Misaka.

79
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,692
But I can't be certain.

80
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:05,692
Though, I am certain
they must be playing

81
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:07,692
some important role
in all this.

82
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:10,067
In any event, I must
locate Mitori Kozaku

83
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,150
and take her into custody.

84
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:14,692
Even if all that's waiting
for me is danger,

85
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:18,858
as a member of Judgment,
I will save Academy City!

86
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,233
[GENSEI] Someone who's
pretending to run away

87
00:04:28,317 --> 00:04:30,983
but still has some plan
shows telltale signs

88
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:33,192
of what they're after.
I don't let those hints

89
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:35,817
that they're about to turn
the tables go unnoticed.

90
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,192
I'm experienced.

91
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:38,692
Which is why I can
tell something else

92
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:40,233
by looking at you now.

93
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:43,358
[SHOKUHO grunting]

94
00:04:43,442 --> 00:04:44,400
[GENSEI]
You're out.

95
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:45,942
You have nothing
left up your sleeve

96
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:48,567
to reverse the
situation, do you?

97
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:55,775
[SHOKUHO gasps]

98
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:09,108
And now the limiter
unlock code is mine.

99
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:21,983
[grunts]

100
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:23,150
C'mon!

101
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,150
[SOGIITA yells]

102
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:33,317
[SOGIITA chuckles]

103
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:37,858
[GENSEI]
Phew, I can't wait to see this.

104
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:40,192
What do you think will
happen to Academy City

105
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:42,858
at that fateful moment?

106
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,692
Oh, I'm sorry.
That was rude of me.

107
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:49,192
I don't suppose you'll be alive
long enough to find out.

108
00:07:25,358 --> 00:07:26,608
[KUROKO]
Not here.

109
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:28,733
[KUROKO grunts]

110
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:30,233
[KUROKO]
Or here.

111
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:37,692
[KUROKO] Not here, either.
Where is this Kozaku girl?

112
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:40,358
I destroyed her puppet's
camera immediately,

113
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:44,317
and rendered her echolocation
completely unusable.

114
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,317
I've successfully taken out
her puppet's eyes and ears.

115
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,233
And yet, it still knew
my general location

116
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:52,150
and could land a hit on me.

117
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:55,817
[KUROKO]
Judging from those actions,

118
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,525
I assumed that Kozaku herself

119
00:07:57,608 --> 00:08:00,067
was watching me from
the upper floors.

120
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,442
[KUROKO]
But if I've looked this much

121
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,275
and still haven't found her,

122
00:08:06,358 --> 00:08:09,233
there must be something
that I overlooked.

123
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:17,400
[SATEN] Hey. Do you think she'll
be okay with those injuries?

124
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:20,025
[UIHARU sighs] Considering she
just got out of the hospital,

125
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:21,650
she may not be.

126
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,067
That's what I thought.

127
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,608
And we can't even
tell what's going on

128
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:26,233
without being able
to see inside.

129
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:28,192
[gasps]

130
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:31,108
[UIHARU] Is that a relay
camera from the festival?

131
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:32,650
Another one.

132
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:34,775
There aren't any
events around here.

133
00:08:34,858 --> 00:08:36,775
[SATEN] Yeah, they flew
in a little while ago.

134
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:38,442
You were so focused
on the building,

135
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:40,150
you didn't notice them.

136
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:46,192
Antiskill probably sent them
in search of any civilians,

137
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,692
just in case they
hadn't evacuated yet.

138
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:50,275
Looks like the E-M
waves at the heart

139
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:52,775
of the electrical phenomenon are
too strong for them to get near.

140
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:54,942
[gasps] I just had a great idea!

141
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:56,567
Why don't we borrow
those cameras?

142
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,275
Then we'd be able to tell what's
going on inside of the building,

143
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:01,150
which means we can
give Shirai some backup!

144
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:04,483
[gasps] Wow, that is a
great idea, coming from you!

145
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:05,775
--Uh...
--[UIHARU] I'll start hacking--

146
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:07,358
I-I mean, accessing
them right away,

147
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:09,358
and then transfer
command over to me.

148
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:10,983
[gasps]

149
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,358
Wait a second, when did you
say those cameras got there?

150
00:09:13,442 --> 00:09:15,650
Uh... Not too long ago.

151
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,942
Like, when Shirai first
entered the building.

152
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,525
[UIHARU] Shirai! This
is only a possibility,

153
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:24,692
but there's something
I think you should know.

154
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,775
[KOZAKU] Not only did she dig up
who I am in this short a time,

155
00:09:29,858 --> 00:09:31,775
but she also had
countermeasures on hand

156
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:34,442
to shut down my echolocation.

157
00:09:34,525 --> 00:09:36,525
I'm impressed.

158
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:40,317
But not intimidated.
Luck is still on my side.

159
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,942
I hacked a festival relay camera

160
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:44,192
that was directing
the evacuation,

161
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:46,358
and I've taken control of it.

162
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:48,067
With it at my disposal,

163
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,817
I've gained the means to control
my Liquid Shadow once again.

164
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,775
Even without echolocation,

165
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:56,692
I still have a set of
eyes on the situation.

166
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,733
[KOZAKU] Oh-ho. Still at it?
Go ahead, search all you like.

167
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,483
[KUROKO]
The last spot.

168
00:10:20,983 --> 00:10:22,150
[KUROKO]
That was all of the places

169
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:24,067
where she could hide herself.

170
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,525
Even supposing we
passed each other,

171
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:28,942
the motion sensor sheets
I placed in key locations

172
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:31,108
would have picked her up.

173
00:10:31,192 --> 00:10:33,275
Was it all for nothing?

174
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,150
[KUROKO] Assuming what
Shokuho said is true,

175
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:40,400
then if we're to return
Misaka to normal,

176
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:43,650
we must neutralize Kozaku
as soon as possible.

177
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:46,483
[KUROKO]
And yet, I...

178
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,233
[KUROKO] No. If I were searching
for her in the wrong place,

179
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:57,733
she wouldn't have been so
relentless in fending me off.

180
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:59,192
Or...

181
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:02,692
[KUROKO] Is that exactly
what she wants me to think,

182
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:04,442
and she isn't here?

183
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:05,692
I need to review the facts.

184
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:08,900
Calmly. If she
isn't hiding here,

185
00:11:08,983 --> 00:11:11,358
then where else could she be?

186
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:13,192
The surveillance
cameras caught Kozaku

187
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:15,525
going onto the street
in front of the building.

188
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,817
However, there has
been no sight of her

189
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,067
on any cameras since.

190
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:22,650
[KUROKO]
This is the only building

191
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,858
in which she could be hiding.

192
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:26,108
[gasps]

193
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,400
[KUROKO]
The only <i>building</i> .

194
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:31,233
--[rustling]
--[KUROKO gasps]

195
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:43,442
[KOZAKU]
That won't work!

196
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:46,108
I can still tell
exactly where you are!

197
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,275
[KOZAKU] I'll corner her so she
has no choice but to teleport!

198
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:55,775
[KOZAKU] It is possible that she
could jump to another floor,

199
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:58,733
but as long as she doesn't
know exactly where I am yet,

200
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:01,233
she's gonna want to jump to
a space that she can confirm

201
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:04,567
is safe with her own eyes.

202
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,483
When she uses her ability
consecutively like this,

203
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:10,692
I've noticed that it
creates a brief lag.

204
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:12,525
If I can predict
where she's going,

205
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,483
and catch her in that instant...

206
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:16,525
There!

207
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:22,692
Uh.

208
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:35,775
[KOZAKU gasps]

209
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:41,983
[KOZAKU laughs]

210
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:45,192
[KOZAKU] Sorry about that, but
if you hadn't gotten in my way,

211
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:48,025
I wouldn't have had to kill you.

212
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:52,108
Then again, if Academy City
is about to be destroyed,

213
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:55,775
you would have met the
same fate sooner or later.

214
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,775
You're just gone
before the rest of us.

215
00:12:57,858 --> 00:12:59,900
[gasps] It's time!

216
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:00,942
[gasps]

217
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:04,233
Sogiita!

218
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,650
[KOZAKU] It's working!
She'll destroy it this time!

219
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:37,858
Ah. So we're already at
the "unlock" stage, are we?

220
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,108
She's progressing a lot
quicker than I expected,

221
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:43,942
which means I don't
have a moment to spare.

222
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:46,400
I'll just go ahead and enter
the limiter unlock code

223
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:48,608
that you so generously
provided me with.

224
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:51,858
[beeping]

225
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:54,150
Code input complete.

226
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:11,150
[KOZAKU giggles]

227
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:13,358
Yeah. I know the whole
city's about to blow up,

228
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:16,442
and you'll be wiped out in
a matter of minutes anyway.

229
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:18,400
But I wanna make sure
you're annihilated

230
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,942
while I'm still
around to enjoy it!

231
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,150
You can apologize to her
in the next life!

232
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:25,942
I hope this hurts!

233
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:26,983
[thud]

234
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,900
[gasps]

235
00:14:32,942 --> 00:14:38,358
[panting]

236
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:40,150
[KUROKO]
I found you!

237
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:54,525
[KUROKO] So, you were
in the sewers after all.

238
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:56,400
You were spotted on the street
in front of the building,

239
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:58,775
but you weren't hiding
anywhere inside.

240
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:02,525
So what other option did you
have, besides coming here?

241
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:04,733
But... I swear
I just killed you!

242
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:05,942
No way!

243
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:08,192
You're still showing up
on the camera feed!

244
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,483
[gasps]

245
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,317
[KOZAKU]
A composite image? Since then?

246
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,608
Impossible! There are tens
of thousands of cameras!

247
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:17,525
Are you saying you were able
to single out the only one

248
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:20,567
under my control and take it
over without me ever noticing?

249
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,067
That's exactly right.

250
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,567
'Cause I have the perfect
partner for that kind of job.

251
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,650
Good work, girl.

252
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,942
And now there's nowhere
left for you to run.

253
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:32,608
[KOZAKU]
My Liquid Shadow is aboveground.

254
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:34,525
There's not enough time
to call it here.

255
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:36,400
But...!

256
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:37,817
[KUROKO]
It's dark.

257
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,442
I have to get closer to
precisely judge the distance!

258
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:42,192
[KOZAKU] Hiding myself
wasn't the only reason

259
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,025
that I fled into the sewer.
It was to be ready

260
00:15:45,108 --> 00:15:47,650
on the off-chance that
you caught up with me!

261
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:50,483
Above ground, you can jump
around just about anywhere,

262
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:52,192
but down here, your
movements are limited

263
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:54,858
to this single, thin line!

264
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:57,358
When you teleport away
to avoid my first knife,

265
00:15:57,442 --> 00:16:00,150
my second knife will get
you wherever you are!

266
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:03,025
Forward? To the side? Up?

267
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:05,317
No matter where you run,

268
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,442
I'll take you down that instant!

269
00:16:10,608 --> 00:16:12,275
[KOZAKU gasps]
She didn't teleport?

270
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:14,192
Oh, no, I'm too slow--!

271
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:15,525
[KOZAKU yells]

272
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,025
[groans]

273
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:22,108
[yells]

274
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,608
[KOZAKU groans]

275
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:31,483
[KOZAKU]
Dolly...

276
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:40,358
[pants]

277
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:48,358
[GENSEI gasping]

278
00:16:55,608 --> 00:17:00,567
[gasping]

279
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:11,275
[GENSEI] I see. So making
me think that you had

280
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:17,317
no further plan remaining
was itself your plan, then.

281
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:22,358
[GENSEI]
I guess...

282
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:27,733
[GENSEI]
...you win this round.

283
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:33,442
[grunts]

284
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:35,233
Huh?

285
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:43,858
[SHOKUHO]
Hm...

286
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:48,858
[SHOKUHO] Graviton panels.
I could probably use these

287
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,733
to create a pitfall
trap of some sort.

288
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:55,358
Or maybe I could physically
capture Gensei between them.

289
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,942
Mm... But would either
of those solutions

290
00:17:58,025 --> 00:18:00,650
really be enough against him?

291
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:03,025
No. Out-scheming that geezer

292
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:05,275
is gonna be a lot
harder than that.

293
00:18:05,358 --> 00:18:08,608
Especially now that he's gotten
his hands on Exterior.

294
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:14,733
[SHOKUHO] Ugh, speaking of.
Do I even need it anymore?

295
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:16,983
I mean, I've thought
about it before.

296
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:18,817
I have to keep
this place hidden,

297
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,275
pay the cost of its upkeep,
and stress about it

298
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:24,567
being taken over, just for
a boost in my ability.

299
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,608
The pros are starting to be
outweighed by the cons.

300
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:30,525
Not to mention, with the size
of the mess it's caused today,

301
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:33,692
other organizations will
find out about it for sure.

302
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:37,900
[SHOKUHO]
But, how would I even go about

303
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,108
getting rid of
something like this?

304
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:43,150
It's designed to withstand
five times the seismic force

305
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:45,858
of the largest earthquake
ever recorded.

306
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:48,900
And, more immediately
problematic, if it did take

307
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:51,150
damage like that, the giant
brain would reflect it

308
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:54,775
to the Mental Out user,
and leave them incapacitated.

309
00:18:54,858 --> 00:18:56,775
The only way to
circumvent that damage

310
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:59,608
is to input the
self-destruct code.

311
00:19:01,692 --> 00:19:03,567
[SHOKUHO] But the only one
with access privileges

312
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,983
at the moment is Gensei.

313
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:09,275
If I'm going to steal
those privileges back,

314
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:12,317
I'll have to undo his
Level Upper first.

315
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,567
But if I could do that,
I wouldn't be in this mess.

316
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,692
I could try to manipulate
Gensei into entering

317
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:20,650
the self-destruct code himself.

318
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:23,567
But I'm getting ahead
of myself again.

319
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,025
[gasps]

320
00:19:25,108 --> 00:19:27,692
[SHOKUHO]
No. I can do it!

321
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:35,942
[SHOKUHO] Though, it would
be incredibly risky.

322
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:39,525
If he sees through it,
it's game over.

323
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:42,025
And even if it does work,
he might still choose

324
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:46,525
to kill me before actually
putting in the code.

325
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:48,358
I really don't care
what ends up happening

326
00:19:48,442 --> 00:19:51,275
to Misaka, but the
research facilities may not

327
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,942
be able to cure the virus
injected into the sisters

328
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:56,108
on their own.

329
00:19:56,192 --> 00:19:59,442
And in order to understand
the virus's configuration,

330
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:01,400
I'd have to do a
little snooping around

331
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:04,025
inside old man Gensei's head.

332
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:07,775
What's more, if I miss
this chance to catch him,

333
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:10,025
I probably won't get another.

334
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,317
[inhales]

335
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,900
[sighs]

336
00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:30,150
It's a big gamble, huh?

337
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:34,692
[SHOKUHO] Not only do I have
to push myself to the limit

338
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,025
and earnestly try to win,

339
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:40,900
I have to bet that, despite
those efforts, I'll still lose.

340
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:42,442
Great.

341
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:44,775
After I swap my own
recognition of the limiter

342
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:47,275
unlock code and the
self-destruct code,

343
00:20:47,358 --> 00:20:50,650
I have to erase all
memory of doing so.

344
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:53,150
[beep]

345
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:56,025
[SHOKUHO] So, it looks like
you wound up entering

346
00:20:56,108 --> 00:20:58,400
Exterior's self-destruct
code when you wanted

347
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:00,942
the limiter unlock code, huh?

348
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:04,108
Somehow I get the feeling
that was my brilliant idea.

349
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:06,150
Not that I remember it.

350
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:20,483
[KAMIJO] It changed.
There's more lightning.

351
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:23,192
Did that girl,
whatever her name was,

352
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:25,442
shut off the power
at the source?

353
00:21:34,358 --> 00:21:38,733
[gasps] What was I doing?

354
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:45,983
[gasps] What is that?

355
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:47,858
What's going on?

356
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:49,400
Stop it! No!

357
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:54,525
I can't unleash that thing!
Why can't I control it?

358
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:56,317
What's happening?

359
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,067
Huh?

360
00:22:03,108 --> 00:22:08,233
[MIKOTO] What is this?
I can't hold it back!

361
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:26,858
[KAMIJO] Well, whatever's
happened, this isn't over yet.

362
00:23:58,233 --> 00:24:00,567
[KAMIJO] Somehow things with
Zapper have gotten even crazier.

363
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,483
But I don't know what
I can do to help her!

364
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,067
Next time, "Dragon Strike."

365
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,067
When science and magic cross
paths, a story is born.

366
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,775
[SOGIITA] Man, you're doing
your preview bit on this show?

367
00:24:09,858 --> 00:24:11,025
You got guts!

368
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:12,358
[KAMIJO]
Huh? Should I not?
