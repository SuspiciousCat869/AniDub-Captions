[MIKOTO yawns]

2
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:40,650
I really haven't been
getting enough sleep.

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,025
I've been having nightmares
ever since I used

4
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:45,317
that first card.

5
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,025
[KANA]
Big sis Misaka!

6
00:00:48,108 --> 00:00:49,983
Well, if it isn't little Kana.

7
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:51,150
Hello!

8
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:52,775
Hello to you too!

9
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:55,317
I see your usual friends
aren't around today.

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,775
Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:56,858 --> 00:00:59,233
That's 'cause I'm going to
the Learning Core to study!

12
00:00:59,317 --> 00:01:02,442
[MIKOTO]
Oh, yeah? Good for you!

13
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:04,067
[KANA]
Hey Misaka, can you walk with me

14
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,525
to the bus terminal?

15
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:06,567
[MIKOTO]
Huh?

16
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,233
Will you get lost if I don't?

17
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:09,483
[KANA]
Mm-mm.

18
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:10,525
[MIKOTO] Do you have to
go down a spooky road

19
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:11,983
or alleyway or something?

20
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:13,067
[KANA]
Not really.

21
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,483
Okay.

22
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:15,858
Then you don't really need
me to go with you, right?

23
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:19,108
[KANA] You aren't doing anything
anyway, so come on!

24
00:01:19,192 --> 00:01:20,692
We're off!

25
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:23,858
[MIKOTO]
Um... Huh?

26
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:25,400
[KANA]
Y'know what?

27
00:01:25,483 --> 00:01:27,233
I just remembered
I saw you on TV

28
00:01:27,317 --> 00:01:29,025
during the Daihasei Festival.

29
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:31,525
[MIKOTO] Huh?
Oh, right, they broadcast that.

30
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:33,317
[KANA] You came in first
in the three-legged race

31
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,192
and scavenger hunt!

32
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:37,525
Yeah, well, if there's one
thing I'm confident in,

33
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:38,692
it's my speed.

34
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:40,150
Not that winning races
means a whole lot

35
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,400
when you get out
into the real world.

36
00:01:42,483 --> 00:01:44,317
[MIKOTO] I mean, you're
not totally wrong, but

37
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,233
you need stamina for everything,
so I wouldn't say it's useless.

38
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:50,567
[KANA] You're such
a muscle-head, Mikoto.

39
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,400
That's not very nice, Kana.

40
00:01:52,483 --> 00:01:53,942
I don't know where you
heard that word, but--

41
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:56,567
Uh-oh! The card man is gone!

42
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,650
[MIKOTO]
Hm?

43
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,858
[MIKOTO]
This is where that Trader was.

44
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:01,108
[KANA]
Hey, just wondering,

45
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:03,525
but do you know what
Indian Poker is?

46
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:05,733
There's usually a guy
who sells cards there.

47
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:07,317
And he had a whole
bunch of them.

48
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,692
But the rarest one he had
was called the "Bust Upper,"

49
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:12,067
and apparently it let
you dream your way

50
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,358
into bigger boobs!
Isn't that crazy?

51
00:02:14,442 --> 00:02:17,692
So crazy, I doubt anyone
would ever fall for it, huh?

52
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:19,525
I mean, you'd have to
have a huge complex

53
00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:21,442
about your figure to be
willing to spend money

54
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:23,525
on something fishy like that!

55
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:25,858
You'd probably have
to be short-tempered, too.

56
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:27,233
Always ready to fight.

57
00:02:27,317 --> 00:02:29,567
Or be a sly little witch who's
always showing off--

58
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,983
[MIKOTO]
Just a minute!

59
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,858
How can you make a little girl
say such awful things,

60
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:33,942
Shokuho?

61
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:36,150
Uh-oh!
Looks like you found me out.

62
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,150
Oh, cool.
I'm already at the bus terminal.

63
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,442
Hey! It's big sis Mikoto!

64
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:45,108
I'm impressed you
figured it out.

65
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:46,942
Anyone could have!

66
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:48,400
[KANA]
Are you two friends?

67
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:51,317
--No, we're definitely not.
--No, of course we aren't.

68
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,108
[SHOKUHO]
Be sure to study hard

69
00:02:53,192 --> 00:02:55,525
so you don't turn out like
this muscle-head.

70
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,233
[KANA]
Muscle-head?

71
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:58,733
See you later!

72
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:03,400
So after that roundabout way
of getting my attention,

73
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,858
what do you want?

74
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:07,233
Also, how did you even find
out about the card thing?

75
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:08,400
[SHOKUHO]
Oh, that?

76
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:09,775
There's something
I needed to look into,

77
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:12,900
and I happened to read
the Card Trader's memories.

78
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:15,108
But you know...
[laughs]

79
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:17,567
You fought for that card like
your life depended on it,

80
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,775
but I don't see
any change at all!

81
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:21,817
Perhaps your body's utter
refusal to allow you

82
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,150
to mature simply overpowered
the card's effects.

83
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:26,358
Shut up!

84
00:03:26,442 --> 00:03:28,317
You think these lumps
of fat are so great?

85
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,025
[SHOKUHO]
Misaka? Have you lost your mind?

86
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:36,400
Yeah, sure, just go wallow
in isolated despair

87
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,108
moments after
assaulting someone!

88
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:13,192
[KUROKO] First there's the
blast-proofing on student buses,

89
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:14,983
then the fact that the shower
rooms are supplied

90
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:18,692
with theoretically pure water
from a solid-state plant.

91
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:19,942
It's all leaked.

92
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:22,858
Along with other secret
details about Tokiwadai.

93
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:25,233
The layout of various campus
facilities and structures

94
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:27,817
are out there for anyone
willing to find them.

95
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,317
It extends to other Garden
of Learning institutions

96
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,525
as well as some
major corporations.

97
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:34,733
Some of the leaks
contain security details,

98
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:37,233
which as you can imagine,
are especially dangerous.

99
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:38,983
And we think we know the cause.

100
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:42,233
It's these cards, commonly
known as Indian Poker.

101
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:44,400
Using them, a person is able
to share their dreams

102
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:46,192
with someone else.

103
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:49,233
Whether intentional or not,
privileged internal information,

104
00:05:49,317 --> 00:05:51,650
normally kept secret from
the general public,

105
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,817
is now being put on
full display for anyone

106
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,275
who finds the right card.

107
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:58,150
[KONORI] So everyday knowledge
for an organization's

108
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,775
insider is precious
information for an outsider,

109
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:02,317
basically.

110
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,108
[UIHARU] Right, each school has
scrambled to take measures.

111
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:06,942
But this isn't a
commercial product.

112
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:09,067
They're made by following
an online guide.

113
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,525
So we can't just take
them off of shelves.

114
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:13,567
Antiskill has attempted
to contact the site

115
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,983
that uploaded the original
plans for the card writer

116
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:18,525
with hopes of convincing
them to remove it.

117
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:20,233
But identifying who
it is that uploaded

118
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:22,692
the plans has been difficult.

119
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:24,108
[KEITZ]
Ryoko Kuriba.

120
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:27,025
Shinshikimi Middle School,
in School District 20.

121
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:28,233
Age 14.

122
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:30,275
The photo is from
when she enrolled.

123
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:31,733
And you're sure she's
the one who came up

124
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:34,067
with the guide for Indian Poker?

125
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,317
You sure took your
time finding her.

126
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,067
It's been over a day
since I asked for this.

127
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,025
I don't give reports until
they've been substantiated.

128
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:43,858
Thank you.

129
00:06:43,942 --> 00:06:45,400
Do you mind if I ask
why you're looking

130
00:06:45,483 --> 00:06:47,858
into this? I'm curious.

131
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:49,692
Because of how
the cards function,

132
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,567
the principle is familiar.

133
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,567
[KEITZ]
Good instinct.

134
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,983
According to my investigation,

135
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:57,692
she also had a part in the
"Clone Dolly" experiments.

136
00:06:57,775 --> 00:06:59,442
[SCHOOLGIRL] It's possible they
were exploring the option

137
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:01,525
of using the cards for
psychological doping

138
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:03,525
or brainwashing.

139
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:06,442
Whether that worked or not,
the cards we know of don't have

140
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:08,067
that kind of function.

141
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,650
But whatever their intent,

142
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:11,275
I'm going to find
the idiot who let this

143
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:13,400
get into the hands of the public

144
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:15,817
and give them a stern
talking to, so to speak.

145
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,108
[CAFÉ MANAGER]
One ramen!

146
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,442
[SCHOOLGIRL]
So, where is this girl?

147
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,525
[KEITZ] Sorry, that's still
under investigation.

148
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:27,692
That's not like you.

149
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:30,608
To be more accurate,
I'm pretty close.

150
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:33,650
She's apparently with
a research institute.

151
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,067
I've been able to confirm
that she's living

152
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,483
within the facility,
but I haven't pursued it

153
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,025
any further.

154
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:41,400
Because while I was
investigating that institute,

155
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:43,442
something felt off.

156
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:46,525
I wasn't certain the Ryoko
Kuriba at the facility

157
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:49,233
was really Ryoko Kuriba.

158
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:51,525
[SCHOOLGIRL]
What's that supposed to mean?

159
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:53,317
[SHOKUHO] So I was able
to pin down the creator

160
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,192
of these cards and
the organization

161
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,567
she's working with.

162
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,525
However, the experiments
they're doing there

163
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:01,150
are a bit "peculiar," let's say.
Basically, they're--

164
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:03,025
I just can't seem
to get over it.

165
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,817
The sheer weight of them
in my hands,

166
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,983
their softness, even though
a layer of clothing,

167
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:08,525
their springiness as they
pushed back against

168
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:10,233
my fingertips.

169
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:12,150
I mean, I was the one
who was grabbing them,

170
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,900
but it's as if they were
clinging to my hands--

171
00:08:14,983 --> 00:08:16,192
That hurt!

172
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:17,858
I've had just about
enough of you reviewing

173
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:19,025
my breasts!

174
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:20,525
How long are you going
to keep obsessing

175
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:21,900
over that, anyway?

176
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:23,650
And that's not even touching
on how weird it is

177
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,442
that you were shocked
in the first place.

178
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:27,025
I'm not trying to gloat here,

179
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:29,483
but it's not exactly a secret
how big they are.

180
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,567
To tell the truth, I thought
they only looked big

181
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,067
from the chain of your bag
cutting between them.

182
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,733
And that, in reality, they
weren't all that much

183
00:08:35,817 --> 00:08:37,650
bigger than mine.
I mean, we are the same age.

184
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:40,650
[SHOKUHO] Has Misaka
always been this dumb?

185
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,817
Anyway, did you hear
anything I said

186
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,817
or did you tune that out?

187
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,400
[MIKOTO] What, about how
you see this as a threat

188
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:49,108
to the control of your
brainwashing territory,

189
00:08:49,192 --> 00:08:50,692
so you want to get rid of it?

190
00:08:50,775 --> 00:08:52,942
Why am I not surprised
at that interpretation?

191
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:55,650
Perhaps it's because it's
as twisted as you are.

192
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:58,567
I'm gonna have to ask that
you stop focusing on me.

193
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,067
The experiment that Ryoko
Kuriba was involved in

194
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,150
is not directly related
to Indian Poker.

195
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:06,192
She was actually
acting as a test subject

196
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:07,650
for cyborg tech.

197
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:09,192
[MIKOTO]
Wait, cyborg?

198
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:11,275
[SHOKUHO] Well, to be fair,
that is an oversimplification.

199
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:13,067
But you know how
advanced artificial organs

200
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,108
have become, right?

201
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:16,108
From mechanical hearts to arms.

202
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:17,567
Though the experiment
she was part of

203
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,900
is pretty far removed from
the usual cybernetics stuff.

204
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:25,400
Ryoko Kuriba was essentially
turned into two people.

205
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:26,775
Her body was taken apart,

206
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,692
and artificial replacements
filled in the gaps

207
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:30,942
on both ends.

208
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:33,192
She went from having
one body to being reborn

209
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:35,900
as two cyborgs.

210
00:09:35,983 --> 00:09:37,733
Okay then.

211
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:40,692
Was she in some sort of
accident and had to do it?

212
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:42,192
[SHOKUHO]
No, not at all.

213
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:45,442
It was purely for the sake of
advancing their research.

214
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:48,525
The two Kuribas lived
separate lives for a year.

215
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:50,317
And after that, her flesh
was reassembled

216
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,650
into her original body.

217
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:53,817
They say it went fine--

218
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,400
There was no mental
split or rejection

219
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:57,733
of body parts
to give them trouble.

220
00:09:57,817 --> 00:10:00,067
Apparently, she retained both
halves of her memories

221
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,650
from when she
was split, as well.

222
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:05,317
Gotta say, that's a pretty
gruesome experiment.

223
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,983
But cyborg medical
treatments have helped

224
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:08,858
a lot of people
with disabilities,

225
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,192
and she volunteered.

226
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:12,233
If the whole thing
is over already,

227
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:15,108
I don't see any reason for
you and me to get involved.

228
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:16,233
Yes.

229
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:18,150
I agree with you,
as far as that goes.

230
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:20,567
However...
advancing cybernetic tech

231
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,358
wasn't the only goal
they had in mind.

232
00:10:23,442 --> 00:10:25,067
As far as Kuriba was concerned,

233
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,650
the goal was to test
the compatibility

234
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:29,192
of the human body and
artificial replacements.

235
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:32,942
And on paper, the institute's
goal was the same, yes.

236
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:34,567
But let's just say that
if they were to stumble

237
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,358
upon something else
in the process,

238
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:40,192
they certainly weren't
going to ignore it.

239
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:43,650
That being the
generation of a soul.

240
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,317
Uh, what?

241
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,442
[SHOKUHO]
Where do you stand?

242
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:48,483
Do you think the soul exists?

243
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:49,942
You're not gonna
bring up that whole

244
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,275
"the body becomes 21
grams lighter when we die"

245
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:53,525
thing, are you?

246
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:55,150
This conversation
was already weird,

247
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:56,692
but that's pushing it.

248
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:59,733
[SHOKUHO] I've honestly no idea
how credible that theory is.

249
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:01,650
But let's suppose
the phenomenon of a soul

250
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:03,483
does in fact, exist.

251
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:05,775
Kuriba was split
into two people.

252
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:07,192
I wonder, what do you
think happened to

253
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:09,442
her soul during that time?

254
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:10,567
For example...

255
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,275
Let's suppose one
of the split Kuribas

256
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:14,817
were to lose her life somehow.

257
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,608
It's hard to imagine
that the other Kuriba,

258
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:17,817
in a separate location,

259
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,983
would die at the
same time, right?

260
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,108
That just sounds silly.

261
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:23,775
Well, then the question becomes,

262
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:26,608
when she was split in two,
did her soul follow suit?

263
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:29,400
Creating an entirely
separate, second soul?

264
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:32,150
And assuming her soul
did in fact, divide,

265
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,567
they still put her back
together after a year.

266
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,525
Leaving just one body.

267
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:38,775
In that scenario,
you have to wonder:

268
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:40,817
"Where would the
leftover soul have gone?"

269
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,400
In other words, you're
wondering if there's a soul

270
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:45,108
dwelling inside
the mechanical body

271
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:47,567
that could be made out
of her prosthetics.

272
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,067
Are we really doing this?

273
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,275
Wha--?
Stop giving me such a hard time!

274
00:11:51,358 --> 00:11:53,525
I was just using the word "soul"
so it wouldn't go way over

275
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:54,525
your head!

276
00:11:54,608 --> 00:11:55,858
For real though.

277
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:58,483
What does any of this have
to do with Indian Poker?

278
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,608
Also, if you found
out who invented it,

279
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:02,150
couldn't you report
that to Judgment

280
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:04,442
or Antiskill and be
done with it already?

281
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:05,817
[SHOKUHO]
I could.

282
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,733
However, before I do,
I was hoping for a favor.

283
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:10,817
I promise, it's not a major ask.

284
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,733
I simply want you to
break into the institute

285
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:14,733
and verify the outcome
of the experiment.

286
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,733
[MIKOTO]
Huh?

287
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:17,108
[SHOKUHO]
I could do it myself,

288
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:19,067
but let's say this mechanical
person does exist,

289
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,733
and I happen to bump into it.

290
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:23,942
There might not be much I can do
to get out of the situation.

291
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:25,858
I've certainly never
encountered such a being,

292
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:27,483
so who's to say whether
my brainwashing

293
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,275
would have any effect on it?

294
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:30,983
It would be much safer
to have a muscle-head

295
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:32,400
like you go instead!

296
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:34,108
Give me one good
reason why I should.

297
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:37,317
Because if they find an actual
use for this experiment,

298
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,150
such as the aforementioned
generation of a soul,

299
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:43,400
how many hundreds of people
will meet a similar fate?

300
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:45,108
They would need more
subjects to verify

301
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:47,650
their results with,
such as Child Errors.

302
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,108
Or perhaps even... human clones.

303
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:54,983
[SHOKUHO] Uh, wow okay,
didn't mean to rile you up.

304
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,567
Considering the labor
and expense,

305
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,150
building a cloning facility
solely for this experiment

306
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:00,817
wouldn't be worth it anyway!

307
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,733
So you can chill out.

308
00:13:02,817 --> 00:13:06,067
Naturally, I'm not asking
you to do this for free.

309
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,275
Let's talk.

310
00:13:07,358 --> 00:13:09,692
Those "Sisters" from
Project Level 6 Shift.

311
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:11,025
Didn't you want them
to be able to live

312
00:13:11,108 --> 00:13:12,733
in normal society someday?

313
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:14,483
For them to live out
their lives in peace,

314
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:16,525
free from danger and prejudice?

315
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:17,858
What a nice thought.

316
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:19,400
But the obstacles
standing in your way

317
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:21,942
are pretty daunting.

318
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:23,192
You know what would help?

319
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:25,317
My ability to control
the human heart.

320
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,150
As well as all the personal
connections that I've amassed.

321
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:29,775
[MIKOTO]
Shokuho.

322
00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:32,942
Why are you so intent on
involving yourself in this?

323
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:35,608
[SHOKUHO] I really don't want to
find myself indebted to you,

324
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:36,817
so let's make the deal.

325
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,025
You better not be lying.

326
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:41,358
I'll hold you to this.

327
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:46,483
In this case?
No, I'm not lying. I promise.

328
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:48,233
[KOZAKU] What was all
that nonsense about?

329
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:52,025
Mikoto's the kind of girl
who'd jump at the chance

330
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:54,983
to take down a crazy experiment
that could get people killed.

331
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,150
She doesn't need another reason.

332
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:59,650
And Misaki, you're not
really offering much here.

333
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:01,317
You would've wanted
to help out the Sisters

334
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,067
anyway, wouldn't you?

335
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,317
Come on.

336
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,650
"Let's make a deal."

337
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:07,067
"You better not be lying!"

338
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,775
"I promise."

339
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:10,442
This whole "deal" is just
to hide how embarrassed

340
00:14:10,525 --> 00:14:11,400
you two are!

341
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:12,608
Why don't you grow up and--

342
00:14:14,692 --> 00:14:16,067
You know, I could
easily break in

343
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,650
and investigate myself.

344
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,567
Or were you really just
trying to see how far

345
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,483
you can push Mikoto for
the sake of the Sisters?

346
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:24,567
Can you please get
out of here, Mitori?

347
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,858
I hope you weren't spying on us

348
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:28,108
just to get a reaction
out of me.

349
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:29,400
Not even close.

350
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:31,025
I'm way too busy for that.

351
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:33,442
I have a message from Keitz.

352
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:34,817
He says he's tracked
down where the real

353
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,817
Ryoko Kuriba is.

354
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,483
[KUROKO] Are you sure you
can't do whatever this is

355
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:42,025
another time?
It's already so late.

356
00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:43,483
[MIKOTO]
Mm-hmm.

357
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,650
I made a little deal, so I
gotta hold up my end of it.

358
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,733
Who'd you make
this deal with, huh?

359
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:49,775
For whom would you
go out this late at night,

360
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:51,942
leaving me here all
by my lonesome?

361
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,108
I know what you're thinking,
and you are so far off base,

362
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:55,483
I promise.

363
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:57,692
Cover for me if the head
resident comes around, 'kay?

364
00:14:57,775 --> 00:15:00,442
[KUROKO] All right.
I guess I can do that.

365
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:05,775
If anything happens, you'll be
the very first person I call.

366
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:07,775
How am I supposed
to respond to that?

367
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,067
Come back safely.

368
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:17,567
[MIKOTO] I haven't dressed
up like this in a while.

369
00:15:18,442 --> 00:15:19,692
Oh, yeah.

370
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:22,692
Last time, they thought
I was a boy, didn't they?

371
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:24,233
Hmm.

372
00:15:24,317 --> 00:15:26,567
Maybe I should have gone with
something a little frillier.

373
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:36,983
[RESEARCHER A]
We're all good.

374
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:38,400
Thanks for your hard work.

375
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,317
[DOPPEL] Hey, how long are
we going to keep doing

376
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,067
these routine tests?

377
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,900
I'd love to leave sometime soon.

378
00:15:46,983 --> 00:15:48,192
[CHIEF RESEARCHER A]
Now, now.

379
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:50,275
This is an
unprecedented experiment.

380
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:52,025
We can't be hasty.

381
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:53,233
That's right, Chief.

382
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:55,192
We need you here
a little longer.

383
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:56,900
After all, we have to be
sure that everything

384
00:15:56,983 --> 00:15:59,108
has gone as smoothly
as we believe it has.

385
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,150
I think you guys are all
worrying too much.

386
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,400
Ugh.

387
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:05,733
It feels like I've been living
in this place forever

388
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:07,025
at this point.

389
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,692
[DOPPEL] Well, shoot.
I got that from my mother.

390
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:33,108
Wait, what?

391
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:37,108
I got that mug from my mom
before coming to Academy City.

392
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:39,275
I know that for sure. But...

393
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,108
I can't remember
anything about my mom.

394
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:45,692
And not just her.

395
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:49,900
My dad and my friends back home.

396
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:51,817
I can't remember much of
anything from before

397
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,275
I came to Academy City.

398
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:58,233
No, even stuff from
after I came to the city, too.

399
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,233
I can vividly remember
things that happened

400
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:02,067
when I was split in two.

401
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,233
I just don't remember
anything from before that.

402
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,233
Is it an aftereffect
of the experiment?

403
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:15,733
Am I... Ryoko Kuriba?

404
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:18,858
Am I...

405
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,900
Am I...

406
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:24,608
...human?

407
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:29,150
[MIKOTO]
Okay.

408
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,025
Did they know I was coming?

409
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:40,942
[MIKOTO]
Huh?!

410
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,692
[MIKOTO]
She's gone?

411
00:17:49,775 --> 00:17:51,067
Why did the banners fall?

412
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,108
It should have held
a hundred kilos.

413
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:54,108
That's weird.

414
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:56,400
She must weigh a ton.

415
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:59,817
Then does that mean
Shokuho was right?

416
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,358
[CHIEF RESEARCHER A]
She ran away?

417
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:02,483
Yes, sir.

418
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:03,942
She destroyed the outer wall,

419
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:06,650
then jumped from the upper
floor and must have fled.

420
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:08,108
What do you mean she jumped?

421
00:18:08,192 --> 00:18:09,567
She's supposed to have
a sense of human

422
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,733
self-preservation!

423
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:12,858
Well, about that...

424
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:14,442
There are only two things
that were destroyed

425
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:16,108
by the impact of the fall.

426
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:19,275
Namely her GPS and the
fast-acting restraints.

427
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:22,192
Which suggests she
planned this. Carefully.

428
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:25,192
Additionally, most of
the research data

429
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:27,358
that was caught in
the blast was lost.

430
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:29,650
Reconstruction
will be difficult.

431
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,067
Are you kidding?

432
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,650
Please tell me the damage
was limited to just here!

433
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:36,025
Yes. Nowhere else was affected.

O-Okay. Whatever.

in here, little lady?

You wouldn't happen to
be a ghost that haunts

Bodies.

People's thoughts
dwell within the brain.

Life dwells within the heart.

And emotions, on the face.

So, if you drive
the soul out of a body,

do you think it can
be made vacant?

00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:21,442
You're not here from
the research lab, right?

475
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:22,442
[WOMAN A]
Right.

476
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:23,525
I just happened
to find your name

477
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:26,233
while investigating
Indian Poker.

478
00:20:26,317 --> 00:20:27,525
[MIKOTO]
Yeah, and for the record,

479
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:29,525
I was roped into this by her.

480
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:33,275
But after seeing what I saw,
I do want answers myself.

481
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,567
What did you see?

482
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,067
Just your cyborg breaking
out of the facility.

483
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,650
It was a little while ago.

484
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:41,650
Breaking out?

485
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,650
Finally, it happened.

486
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:46,233
[MIKOTO] Then I take it
you knew about that thing.

487
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:47,483
Yeah.

488
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,317
The chief and the other
researchers called her

489
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,567
"Doppelganger."

490
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,317
I saw her on the monitor
right after my surgery.

491
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,942
A mechanical puppet who
identifies herself as a human.

492
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,817
As me.

493
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Everyone at the
facility was ecstatic.

494
00:21:03,983 --> 00:21:05,567
They created a soul.

495
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,942
They said it was
uncharted territory.

496
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:09,192
So it's true?

497
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:11,358
There's a soul inside
of that machine? Wow.

498
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:13,775
[KURIBA] To tell you the truth,
even after seeing it,

499
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:16,442
I wasn't totally convinced.
Still not.

500
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,358
But I was also worried
that if it had happened,

501
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:22,233
it would inevitably create
some serious problems.

502
00:21:22,317 --> 00:21:23,817
Why "serious?"

503
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,400
I mean, I understand
that she's going to be

504
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:27,233
a little sturdier than a
flesh-and-blood person

505
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:30,733
would be, but she's just
for medical use, no?

506
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:32,775
It's not like she's
built for combat.

507
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,192
Is it really a threat
when there's only one

508
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:35,983
of her running around?

509
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,275
Maybe.

510
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:39,067
I told them that someday
she would realize

511
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,483
that she isn't human,
but they said,

512
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,233
"Then we'll get some
more data from that,"

513
00:21:44,317 --> 00:21:45,817
and "The lower levels
of the building

514
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,108
have layer after
layer of security.

515
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:49,858
Plus, she has a shutdown
device implanted,

516
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,192
so it's fine."

517
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:52,483
Idiots.

518
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:54,483
They refused to listen to me
about the dangers

519
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:55,525
of that thing.

520
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,608
This artificial skin will help.

521
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Well, it is important
to look the part.

522
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:16,858
And while I'm at it, let's see.

523
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:23,150
[LEADER]
Found her.

524
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:27,192
An abandoned facility
in School District 20.

525
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:29,525
You were in there for a
pretty long time, Yaku.

526
00:22:29,608 --> 00:22:31,150
Did you take a huge dump?

527
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:34,067
Or are we having
a lady's day today?

528
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,358
[LEADER]
Give it a rest, Naru.

529
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:39,192
Don't you realize the weight
of what we're dealing with here?

530
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,900
[SCAVENGER LIAISON]
That's the right attitude.

531
00:22:41,983 --> 00:22:43,567
You had a big job to do.

532
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,733
A request straight from
the governing board,

533
00:22:45,817 --> 00:22:48,400
and you guys messed it up.

534
00:22:48,483 --> 00:22:50,525
I know you were up
against that monster,

535
00:22:50,608 --> 00:22:52,233
but you still failed
and came running back

536
00:22:52,317 --> 00:22:53,942
with your tails
between your legs.

537
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:55,942
Your reputation as
a dark side subsidiary

538
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:57,942
organization is in the pits.

539
00:22:58,025 --> 00:22:59,608
If you make one more mistake...

540
00:22:59,692 --> 00:23:01,358
[NARU]
Yeah, yeah, we get it already!

541
00:23:01,442 --> 00:23:03,233
If we screw up this
mission, it's over.

542
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:05,150
We're as good as strays.

543
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:07,442
I wish strays were all we'd be.

544
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:09,442
[SCAVENGER LIAISON]
Now that we're crystal clear,

545
00:23:09,525 --> 00:23:13,067
get a move on, you
dumpster-diving scavengers.

546
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,817
[LEADER] She talks down
to us like some kind of

547
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,650
self-absorbed teacher.

548
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:21,108
I wasn't expecting us to
be disrespected like this

549
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,733
from one failed mission.

550
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:25,025
Take it easy over there, Leader.

551
00:23:27,858 --> 00:23:29,442
[LEADER]
Yeah, I know, Seike.

552
00:23:30,817 --> 00:23:33,275
Okay, let's go, guys.

553
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:34,525
[NARU]
Oh, yeah!

554
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:37,733
Time to snag us that big
ol' hunk of scrap metal!

555
00:23:58,025 --> 00:24:00,150
[NARU]
Manipulator of paper. Naru!

556
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:02,317
[SEIKE] Controller of
frictional coefficients, Seike!

557
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,525
[YAKUMARU] Your resident
chemical expert! Yakumaru!

558
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,858
[LEADER] Master of the birds-eye
view. Leader!

559
00:24:06,942 --> 00:24:08,525
[GROUP]
The four of us combined are...

560
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:09,733
...Scavenger!

561
00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:11,067
[NARU] Let's introduce
ourselves like that!

562
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,150
[GROUP]
Overruled.
