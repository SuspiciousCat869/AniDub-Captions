00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,791
[KEITZ]
Coming around, are you?

2
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,460
We're in School District 2.

3
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,170
You can rest easy.

4
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,797
"Then does that mean

5
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,383
you're the one who found me
and brought me here?"

6
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:53,178
asks Misaka, attempting
to express her gratitude.

7
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,515
Please, all of this is
just part of the job.

8
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,933
You really don't
need to thank me.

9
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,982
[KEITZ]
Back to sleep again, huh?

10
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,984
[alarm blaring]

11
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,318
Oh, great.

12
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,612
And here I was, convinced
that I had finally found

13
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,447
some respectable work again.

14
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,545
So you're saying
Gensei Kihara's real target

15
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,589
was the place on
the urban legends site?

16
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,757
That's right.

17
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,634
But how did he
find out about it?

18
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,845
It wasn't me!

19
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,430
Yes, I'm aware of that.

20
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,558
When I consider the timeline,
it just doesn't fit.

21
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,227
The information
could have been a trap

22
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,354
to lead us into action.

23
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,814
Like, maybe he
doesn't really know

24
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,816
where the place is,
and he's tailing us now

25
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,817
to find it.

26
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,485
[SHOKUHO]
It is possible.

27
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,238
But if you're right,
he'll get there after us,

28
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,615
and I can handle that.

29
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,075
Worst case scenario‐‐

30
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,622
What's wrong?
Why are you stopping?

31
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,457
A traffic jam?

32
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,792
What's happening?

33
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,627
Apparently there was
an incident yesterday

34
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,295
where one of the
unmanned Academy City

35
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,047
buses burst into flames.

36
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,465
All the buses
have been shut down

37
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,968
while they try to
determine the cause.

38
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,469
And with one of the
main means of travel

39
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,638
during the Daihasei
Festival gone,

40
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,765
there are traffic jams
all over for kilometers.

41
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,937
We're blocked in
from behind, too.

42
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,731
Then there's no other choice.

43
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,276
Okay, Exterior.

44
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,696
Voluntary will reversal
beyond the 13th pair.

45
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,784
Hey, Shokuho.

46
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,633
The road!

47
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,552
Now drive through
the gap between them!

48
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,887
Hurry it up!

49
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,263
[M DRIVER A]
Uh... Right!

50
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,977
[MIKOTO]
No way, did Shokuho do this?

51
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,272
Thousands of people
over several kilometers?

52
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,193
I don't care if she is
Academy City's greatest

53
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,944
mental esper.

54
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,322
She shouldn't be able
to exert this much power.

55
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,574
It's way too much.

56
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,077
So then, how did she do this?

57
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,954
[SHOKUHO]
Above all else,

58
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,081
I have to keep it from
falling into their hands

59
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,374
while I'm gone.

60
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,215
Makuwa.

61
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,467
Would you mind telling me
what you're eating?

62
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,720
Huh? Melon slice, obviously.

63
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,097
And what was that
food you hate again?

64
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,307
[MAKUWA]
Apples.

65
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,268
[CHIEF RESEARCH]
Right. That'll do for now.

66
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,311
[controller beeps]

67
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,689
[MAKUWA coughs]

68
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,527
[GROUP laughing]

69
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,695
[SHOKUHO yawns]

70
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,489
[F RESEARCH B] It looks like
your abilities are progressing

71
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,740
nicely.

72
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,326
Now all that's left is
to complete Exterior.

73
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,410
[SHOKUHO]
I guess.

74
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,121
But it's not like
I really need that thing.

75
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,040
Oh, come on, don't be like that.

76
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,125
You stand to gain
a lot from this project.

77
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,212
We're not the only ones getting
something out of it, you know.

78
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,381
So, are we done for today?

79
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,507
Can I go home?

80
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,591
Almost.

81
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,761
But first, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

82
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:45,720
[SHOKUHO]
Huh?

83
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,561
[F RESEARCH B]
Well, how are you feeling today?

84
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,437
Let me introduce you.

85
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,066
This is the Prototype,
but we just call her "Dolly."

86
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,568
[SHOKUHO]
Prototype?

87
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,950
[F RESEARCH B] Come on, now,
be nice and say hello.

88
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,159
[DOLLY]
No!

89
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,494
Oh, keep it down.

90
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,705
We're both girls, so what
if your shirt opens?

91
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,002
Don't look at me.

92
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,131
[F RESEARCH B] Oh. Well, guess I
don't need to go to the trouble

93
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,174
of explaining now.

94
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,802
She was born with a kind
of illness, you see.

95
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,930
Without those devices
implanted inside her body,

96
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,307
she wouldn't be able to live.

97
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,358
I'm sorry. I know.

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,110
I'm gross, aren't I?

99
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,821
I dunno. Not really.

100
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,407
[DOLLY]
I am. I know it.

101
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,954
I used to have a friend.

102
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,831
[SHOKUHO]
Hm?

103
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,249
[DOLLY]
Mi.

104
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,668
She used to come here every day.

105
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,670
Since I couldn't go outside,

106
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,964
we talked about
all sorts of things

107
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,799
and played together a lot.

108
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:10,263
But... then she got
a look at my body.

109
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,768
After that, she stopped
coming to see me.

110
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,941
Why... Why is my body like this?

111
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,692
It disgusted the
only friend I had

112
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,736
in the whole world.

113
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,905
I miss her so much.

114
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,908
[SHOKUHO]
So...

115
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,452
What was the reason you wanted
me to meet that girl?

116
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,829
No one told me about
her until today.

117
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,623
We've been collecting
data from Dolly

118
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,124
for some time.

119
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,377
But the shock of losing
her friend is so great

120
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:44,005
we can't read any normal
values from her right now.

121
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,299
We want you to restore
her peace of mind,

122
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,009
or rather, cheer her up.

123
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,178
How do you expect me to do that?

124
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,222
With my ability
the way it is now,

125
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,015
I can't completely
erase the memories

126
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,225
of her friend,

127
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,561
and even overwriting
them would be difficult.

128
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,939
Ah. Yes.

129
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,609
But what about her
sense of recognition?

130
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,735
[knocking]

131
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,447
[SHOKUHO]
Can I come in?

132
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,574
You came to see me today, too?

133
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,742
Hey, Mi!

134
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,792
[SHOKUHO] Why am I the
one who has to do this?

135
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,475
[SHOKUHO] Ugh...
What are you doing?

136
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,021
[SHOKUHO laughing]

137
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:45,483
Really? Are you sure
you're in middle school?

138
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,568
Yeah, I am.

139
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,111
[SHOKUHO]
Here.

140
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,613
That's what the
doctor always tells me.

141
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:54,325
Though, I've never actually
gone to a school before.

142
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,703
[DOLLY]
Is it fun, Mi? School?

143
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,330
Uh... That's a good question.

144
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,208
I'm kinda ostracized
because of my ability.

145
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,835
"Ostracized?"

146
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,088
[SHOKUHO] It's like to get on
people's bad side, I guess.

147
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,632
Huh? That's crazy!

148
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,135
I love your ability, Mi.

149
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,012
Here.

150
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,513
You know I can't.

151
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,307
They told me I'm supposed
to avoid using it

152
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,975
as much as humanly possible.

153
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,018
Aww.

154
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:28,026
What is it like outside
the research lab?

155
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,279
I'd love to go see
the ocean someday.

156
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,740
[SHOKUHO] Well unfortunately
for you, Academy City

157
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,617
doesn't have an ocean.

158
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,327
Plus, the checkpoints
are so strict,

159
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,997
it's not very easy
to get out of the city.

160
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,875
[SHOKUHO] But that said,
if we could get an exit pass,

161
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,796
somehow, I'd be happy
to take you to the beach.

162
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,465
[DOLLY laughs]
Thank you, Mi!

163
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,550
[SHOKUHO]
Whoa, easy!

[DOLLY sniffs]

165
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,513
Huh? Hey‐‐
What are you doing?

166
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,141
Nothing.

167
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,978
[SHOKUHO]
If you say so.

168
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,022
[F RESEARCH B]
Good progress.

169
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:06,856
[CHIEF RESEARCH]
Yeah.

170
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,399
Let's see how this turns out.

171
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,991
[DOLLY]
And I made it!

172
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,661
Yay! I win again!

173
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,995
[SHOKUHO sighs]

174
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,129
I got it in!

175
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,297
[SHOKUHO]
Hey, that's bad manners.

176
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,216
Oh, yeah, you always
have to get close

177
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,135
to throw things away, huh?

178
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,388
Well of course I do!
Like I said, basic manners!

179
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,014
For your information,
a girl our age

180
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,891
literally throwing
garbage away is maybe

181
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,977
the biggest faux pas
I can think of.

182
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,478
It might be okay to do now,

183
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,188
but once you leave
the research facility,

184
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,065
boys will judge you
on every little thing.

185
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,483
Every move you make!

186
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,901
It's in your best
interest to adopt

a more refined attitu‐‐

[DOLLY]
You can't make the shot?

189
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,199
[SHOKUHO]
Huh?! What?!

190
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,993
I could easily do it!

191
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,911
Really? You sure?

192
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,997
[SHOKUHO]
I'll prove it. Just watch!

193
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,300
[SHOKUHO]
That one was...

194
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,051
Uh, a little off
because my finger

195
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,469
got caught on the bottle!

196
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,056
I didn't consider
air resistance!

197
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:26,686
Ah! I had something in my eye!

198
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,938
I'll sink it this time for sure.

199
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,816

She does keep getting closer.

They're coming.

She'll be collected shortly.

Oh, dear.

211
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,602
I knew it wouldn't
be much longer, but...

212
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,731
You have to shake this off.

00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,566
I mean, this is just...

Can you tell me
what your name is?

[SHOKUHO gasps]

Misaki. It's Misaki Shokuho.

Misaki, thank you
so much for being

[SHOKUHO] She...
She's gonna be okay, right?

She'll recover and be
right back, won't she?

I'm sorry, but this
is goodbye for Dolly.

[SHOKUHO gasps]

224
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,493
[CHIEF RESEARCH] Her body
should have surpassed its limits

225
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,829
a long time ago.

226
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,707
Even with the tools
this city has to offer,

227
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,542
it would be impossible
to extend her life

228
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,253
any longer.

229
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,339
I'm sure Dolly herself
was well aware of that.

230
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,349
[F RESEARCH B]
Oh, are you in here again?

231
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,101
You can't do this,
you're falling behind

232
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,811
in your studies.

233
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,146
I almost forgot.

234
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,399
I received the report, and
thought you'd want to know.

235
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,942
It says that she died.

[M RESEARCH C]
Good grief.

237
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,576
You're telling me Shokuho's
having problems now?

238
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,537
Who knew a girl like her
actually had feelings?

239
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,247
What if one of us
finally told her Dolly

240
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,999
was just a clone?

241
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,834
If she knew that
she was artificial,

242
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,586
she might take
this a lot better.

243
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,215
[CHIEF RESEARCH] Well, if the
present situation continues,

244
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,884
I'll consider it.

245
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,761
We have to remember
the Exterior project

246
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,888
isn't just some mindless
data collection

247
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,766
and doll play pushed
on us by the top brass.

248
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,934
It's the continuation
of our aspirations

249
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,436
from Clone Dolly.

250
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,355
[M RESEARCH E]
But what do we do now?

251
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,107
If Misaki Shokuho keeps
developing like this,

252
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,734
one day, our mental
guards won't be able

253
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,694
to keep her out anymore.

254
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,279
And then it'll become
that much harder

255
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,240
to keep the project's
true purpose a secret.

256
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,575
[CHIEF RESEARCH chuckles]

257
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,786
That's not that big
of a problem, really.

258
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,912
Oh, no?

259
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,372
Why do you say that?

260
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,874
Because once Exterior
is ultimately completed,

261
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,876
we'll have no more
use for the girl.

262
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,754
We'll find the right
opportunity to dispose of her.

263
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:43,508
[M RESEARCH E] All right, this
concludes our regular meeting.

264
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,967
[F RESEARCH B]
Good work, everyone.

265
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:53,393
Well, that went pretty much
how I expected it to.

266
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,727
After that,

267
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:58,356
I extended my control
beneath the surface.

268
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,525
All of the personnel
involved in Exterior

269
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,859
were brainwashed,

270
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,112
so that no matter
what was done to them,

271
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,030
they'd never reveal
anything I didn't want

272
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,657
out there.

273
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,451
So how did Gensei
find the location?

274

[M RADIO A]
Objective passing target point.

[M COMMANDER A]
Copy. Everyone, fall back!

00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,713
[KAMIJO sighs]

277
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,341
After all that,
I actually finished.

278
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,385
Thanks to this.

279
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,428
Okay.

280
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,013
What was that girl's
name again? Saten?

281
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,308
Unless I'm crazy, we agreed
to meet up right here.

282
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,643
Am I crazy?

283
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,229
[SHOKUHO]
No signal?

284
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,689
Yeah, good luck.

285
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,232
The surrounding
area's being flooded

286
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,026
with tons of powerful
radio jammers.

287
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,445
No surprise.

288
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,905
Since this clearly
wasn't a bluff.

289
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,953
That's weird. It's too quiet.

290
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,789
I don't sense any
unmanned weapons, either.

291
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,833
[SHOKUHO] They could've removed
them once they found out

292
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,251
Misaka was with me.

293
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,088
[MIKOTO]
Question.

294
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,215
Where's the staff
that was working here?

295
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,341
[SHOKUHO]
Beats me.

296
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,260
I needed them to
maintain Exterior,

297
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,637
so I wouldn't be surprised
if they were killed.

298
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,930
Exterior?

299
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,849
[SHOKUHO]
You saw it earlier, remember?

300
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:15,892
[MIKOTO]
When?

301
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,061
I guess if I had to
put it into words,

302
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,564
Exterior is a booster
that extends the range

303
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,984
and amplifies the power
of my ability.

304
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,611
On the surface.

305
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,362
[MIKOTO]
What does that mean?

306
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,864
It means it can
function that way,

307
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,241
but that's not the original
purpose of the project.

308
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,911
Letting anyone in the
world use my ability was.

309
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,621
[MIKOTO]
Huh...

310
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,663
Huh?

311
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,042
[SHOKUHO]
Whether it was an esper

312
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,211
or just your average person.

313
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,129
Anyone registered
to Exterior would gain

314
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,089
the power to use Mental Out.

315
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,218
It's quite the fascinating
toy, isn't it?

316
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,138
"Clone Dolly" was originally
a research institution

317
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,224
whose goal was
to produce geniuses

318
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,143
and all sorts of other
incredible people.

319
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,104
But perhaps they were blinded
by my exceptional power,

320
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,940
because some
researchers began thinking

321
