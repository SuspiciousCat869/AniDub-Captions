So "a DNA computer that

If she's hiding it, then
Shokuho is probably involved

in this research.

I wouldn't go that far just yet.

that she wanted to keep the fact

she was at this place a secret.

11

Following that logic,
this is likely her hideout.

that she collapsed
from heat exhaustion.

a guess at what her ability is.

It allowed her to
remotely control a liquid metal,

and create a likeness
of herself out of it.

Plus, if she's
a Level 3 or a Level 4,

160

that should narrow down

Good call, then.

162
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:30,025
If we can find her,
I'm sure it'd help Misaka.

163
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:32,442
Listen, I'm only acting
as a member of Judgment.

164
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:35,400
I'm pursuing a criminal
wanted for attempted murder.

165
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:36,983
I can't just hand
the sensitive details

166
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:40,025
of my investigation
over to a civilian.

167
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:41,192
Aww.

168
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:43,400
[KUROKO] However!
If the situation becomes

169
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:45,608
far more urgent, and I think
sharing the information

170
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,608
with her could help
the investigation,

171
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:51,192
then I may be able
to make an exception.

172
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:53,692
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

173
00:08:53,775 --> 00:08:55,567
Okay! I'll just have
to help you search

174
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,775
so we can find her faster!

175
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:57,983
Hey, did you hear me?

176
00:08:58,067 --> 00:08:59,608
What was that weird face about?

177
00:09:03,858 --> 00:09:05,275
Wasn't that
the place in the photo?

178
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:06,858
Why are we going passed it?

179
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:09,650
I believe I already
told you that I'm short on time.

180
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:12,858
If you want to talk to me
so badly, don't complain.

181
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:14,358
Plus, just think about it.

182
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:16,858
Why would I want anyone
going near that place?

183
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:17,983
[MIKOTO grunts]

184
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:19,817
You've got
no reason to look so angry.

185
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,317
Once this is over,
I'll give her straight to you.

186
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,192
It looks like she was injected
with a powerful nanodevice.

187
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:27,025
Because of that,
I'm a little concerned about

188
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,692
her immune system, but her
life is in no real danger.

189
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:33,192
And the people who
injected this "nanodevice" thing

190
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:36,442
in her--they're the ones who
are looking for the Sisters?

191
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:38,608
What's the story with them?

192
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:41,692
I thought they were operating
under your orders at first...

193
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:45,233
...but they've kept on looking,
even after her disappearance.

194
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:47,233
And they're poking around,
asking about things

195
00:09:47,317 --> 00:09:49,233
you wouldn't have to.

196
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:50,900
At this point,
I'm guessing you guys

197
00:09:50,983 --> 00:09:52,692
are on opposite sides.

198
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:55,108
Yep. And, right now,
we're headed straight

199
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:57,067
to where their boss is gonna be.

200
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,192
If you must know,
it all started

201
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:01,733
when I heard about
an experiment.

202
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:03,525
One that you're
quite familiar with.

203
00:10:03,608 --> 00:10:06,442
Project Level 6 Shift.

204
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:08,192
Some of the
researchers at the facility

205
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,692
I was with were whispering
about it amongst themselves.

206
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:13,400
Apparently,
the project hit a setback,

207
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:16,608
and its data had leaked
into the underworld.

208
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:20,108
[SHOKUHO] I haven't.
But I'd like you to tell me.

209
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:21,900
[RESEARCHER 08A]
From what I've heard,

210
00:10:21,983 --> 00:10:24,233
they were trying to elevate
the first-ranked, Accelerator,

211
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:27,025
to Level 6 by having him fight
mass-produced clones

212
00:10:27,108 --> 00:10:29,942
of the third-ranked,
Mikoto Misaka.

213
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:30,942
[RESEARCHER 08B]
But the project seems to have

214
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:33,192
stalled midway through.

215
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:34,692
So then, what happened
to all the clones

216
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:36,192
they made for it?

217
00:10:36,275 --> 00:10:37,233
[RESEARCHER 08B]
I don't know.

218
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:40,275
I assume they were disposed of?

219
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:42,108
[SHOKUHO] So? Have you
discovered what's become

220
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:44,983
of the Sisters,
since the experiment ended?

221
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:45,983
Not just yet.

222
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,275
I apologize.

223
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:48,483
What's the hold up?

224
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:50,983
You were involved in
the experiment, right?

225
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,817
That's part of the reason
why I hired you to begin with.

226
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,150
I was involved, yes,
as a security advisor.

227
00:10:57,233 --> 00:10:59,067
And when the project
was suspended,

228
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,483
the Sisters were taken in
by some other institution.

229
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:05,567
But... I'll check with my
contacts and see what I find.

230
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,775
I would prefer it
if you did so

231
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:08,567
sooner rather than later.

232
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,233
Just know,
one thing concerns me.

233
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:12,608
[SHOKUHO]
Mm?

234
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:13,858
[KEITZ] It looks like there's
another organization

235
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:17,275
trying to track down the
Sisters at the moment.

236
00:11:17,358 --> 00:11:19,025
[SHOKUHO]
Is there? Then you'd better do

237
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:22,608
a concurrent investigation
on them, too.

238
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:24,692
And what we found
from that venture.

239
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:26,358
Were these other guys, right?

240
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:27,608
The ones you've
encountered so far

241
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:29,692
have just been hired hands.

242
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:32,317
It sounds as though their
directive was to get rid of you

243
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,817
and search for the Sisters
at the same time.

244
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,358
Why get rid of me?

245
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:37,567
Well, you were
the one who threw

246
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,608
the original Sisters
project into disarray

247
00:11:39,692 --> 00:11:41,650
if I'm not mistaken.

248
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:43,900
So I'm sure you're
on their radar.

249
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:45,817
And now an innocent
girl is paying the price

250
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,317
in place of me.

251
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,692
[SHOKUHO]
What I'm wondering is why

252
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,858
they only tried to immobilize
you with a nanodevice.

253
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:53,817
But I think we can
both imagine the reason

254
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,108
they'd need the
Sisters, can't we?

255
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:59,067
After all, there's only one
thing they could want.

256
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,692
It's the Misaka Network.

257
00:12:00,775 --> 00:12:02,400
Right. The network formed by

258
00:12:02,483 --> 00:12:05,275
the Sister's brainwave link
is quite valuable.

259
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,358
If its incredible
processing power were to fall

260
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:09,275
into the wrong hands,
then any number of

261
00:12:09,358 --> 00:12:11,358
awful things could happen.

262
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:13,525
So I took preventative measures.

263
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,483
I took out every pathway
that could carry

264
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,317
an electrical virus
between the sisters.

265
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,983
Using my amazing ability.

266
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:22,733
That way,
even if another Sister were

267
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:25,275
to find herself in
the clutches of our enemies,

268
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:28,150
they won't be able to use her to
mess with the Misaka Network.

269
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:30,775
So that's what you
meant by having the initiative.

270
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:32,567
Okay, but do you know what
they're planning to use

271
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,525
the Misaka Network for?

272
00:12:34,608 --> 00:12:36,275
Unfortunately,
all I can say for sure

273
00:12:36,358 --> 00:12:39,525
is that it isn't going
to be anything good.

274
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:42,067
After all, the man
we're dealing with here...

275
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,650
...was the one pushing
for Project Level 6 Shift...

276
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:47,275
...Gensei Kihara.

277
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:52,858
Gensei Kihara...

278
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:55,525
I've never met him in person,
but I have heard his name

279
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,358
a number of times.

280
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:59,150
You're saying he was
the primary advocate

281
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:00,317
for that project?

282
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,942
Regrettably,
not just that one, either.

283
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:06,525
That man is willing to sacrifice
anything to find the "truth."

284
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:09,067
He's the grandfather
of Academy City's field of study

285
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,358
focusing on SYSTEM,
and has brought down

286
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:14,567
countless research institutions.

287
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,733
He's not so short-sighted
that he'd propose

288
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:18,858
simply "restarting" the project.

289
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:21,317
So he must have
something up his sleeve.

290
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,025
Now you know who
I'm talking about.

291
00:13:23,108 --> 00:13:25,358
And like I told you before,
we're currently en route

292
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:27,400
to the man's location.

293
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:29,358
Is he really that easy to find?

294
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,983
Of course not.

295
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:33,358
He's adept at making
himself disappear,

296
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:36,108
so it took a lot of work
to track him down.

297
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:37,442
He's supposed to be attending

298
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,775
the International Ability
Researchers Conference

299
00:13:39,858 --> 00:13:42,608
about to be held
in School District 9.

300
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:44,567
I read the mind
of one of his inside men,

301
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,358
so it's a sure thing.

302
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:48,858
This is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,

303
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:52,025
so I'm using it
to settle things with him.

304
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:53,525
Did you screw
with my friends' memories

305
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:55,025
to "protect" them?

306
00:13:55,108 --> 00:13:57,108
To, like, keep them out
of the mess this is

307
00:13:57,192 --> 00:13:59,400
all about to become
or something?

308
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:01,900
Because that feels like what
you're about to tell me.

309
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,900
Well, they like to get
involved just as much as you do,

310
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:07,150
and they'd almost
certainly die if

311
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:09,067
they went up against this man.

312
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,525
Even if they didn't,

313
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:12,233
any way they might intervene
would mess with

314
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:14,942
my careful plans,
and I can't have that.

315
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:17,108
Things would have
turned out poorly for everyone.

316
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:19,275
I was trying to
be smart about it.

317
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:24,358
[MIKOTO] Okay then. Why didn't
you tell me about this

318
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:25,983
from the start?

319
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:27,192
Why go through
the trouble of erasing

320
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:29,317
their memories to hide it?

321
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,692
I see you
already forgot about

322
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:33,317
our earlier conversation,
so let me remind you.

323
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,317
You're on their radar, and if
we teamed up, I would be, too.

324
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,775
[MIKOTO] Still, there were
any number of ways

325
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:39,567
you could have gone about this!

326
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,983
I mean, Kongo got--

327
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:46,233
[MIKOTO] I guess I was
the one who got her involved.

328
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:48,442
And if she did run
into them by accident...

329
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:49,775
...then I'd be
misdirecting my anger

330
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:52,483
if I blamed you
for it. But still!

331
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:53,775
You should have
just come to me with this

332
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:55,275
from the beginning!

333
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:59,400
Then maybe Kongo wouldn't have
ended up in the hospital!

334
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:02,567
[SHOKUHO] I honestly do feel bad
about what happened to her.

335
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,858
But...

336
00:15:03,942 --> 00:15:05,317
In the end,
she took out some trash

337
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,650
I'm not very fond of, and I
appreciate the assistance.

338
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:09,817
So that's a win.

339
00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:12,192
Are you kidding?

340
00:15:12,275 --> 00:15:14,192
I could have taken him out
easily if you had told me!

341
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:15,358
Explain!

342
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:17,442
What if you had
set off their alarm bells,

343
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:20,692
but Gensei Kihara
didn't present himself?

344
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:22,692
What if you
decided to sell me out

345
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:24,608
and hand me right over to them?

346
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:28,567
--I'd never do something like--
--[SHOKUHO] Cooperation? Trust?

347
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,067
I don't know how
you can bring yourself

348
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,650
to believe in such
hollow things.

349
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,692
You've taken people
at their word before,

350
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:36,192
and look what happened.

351
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:37,775
Project Radio Noise...

352
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:39,858
...and Project Level 6 Shift.

353
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,817
[SHOKUHO]
I'm different.

354
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,608
I make sure to peek
around inside the head

355
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:46,525
of anyone I work with.

356
00:15:46,608 --> 00:15:49,108
I learn their motives
and standards of behavior.

357
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:53,525
And in some cases, I manipulate
their emotions and actions.

358
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:54,983
I can't know
what you're thinking,

359
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,692
so partnering with you
was out of the question.

360
00:15:57,775 --> 00:15:58,942
You understand.

361
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:01,983
[SHOKUHO]
And yet we're together now.

362
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:03,733
But I'm only allowing you
to chat with me because

363
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:06,317
I respect your
dedication to your friends.

364
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,067
And because we're
so close to finishing this,

365
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,983
they couldn't possibly
do anything even if

366
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:12,025
they saw us together.

367
00:16:12,108 --> 00:16:13,608
Surprise, surprise.

368
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:15,858
You and I are never gonna
get along, are we?

369
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,567
[MIKOTO]
One more question.

370
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,317
Why would someone
as heartless as you are

371
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,233
care about the Sisters?

372
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:30,525
Sorry. I'm under
no obligation to tell you that.

373
00:16:30,608 --> 00:16:31,650
Plus...

374
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:34,025
...it looks like
we're just about there.

375
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:35,400
[UIHARU groans softly]

376
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:42,608
[UIHARU]
Ms. Misuzu?

377
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:46,317
This is the 177
Branch's infirmary.

378
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:50,858
[KUROKO] Okay, so if we
assume you're correct...

379
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:52,358
...it would mean
that Uiharu has been

380
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:55,067
manipulated since yesterday.

381
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,192
[SATEN]
Yeah. They did a lot of work

382
00:16:57,275 --> 00:16:59,858
to hide the site,
but she found it anyway.

383
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:01,317
So I'm sure they'd
track her down

384
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,275
once they figured
out who she was...

385
00:17:03,358 --> 00:17:04,983
...then show up,
and alter her memories

386
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,150
to whatever they
wanted them to be.

387
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:08,775
I wonder if that's why
she made that mistake

388
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:10,900
on our patrol route as well.

389
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:15,067
[SATEN] Hmm... Either way, let's
not tell her about this, okay?

390
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,067
She'd probably find some way
to blame herself for it.

391
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,192
Ah! Uiharu!

392
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:23,483
Um, sorry to eavesdrop...

393
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:26,275
...but could you please tell me
what you're talking about?

394
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:27,275
[SATEN]
Uh...

395
00:17:27,358 --> 00:17:28,942
--If you insist.
--[gasps]

396
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:30,567
However, before we do,
would you please

397
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,067
make us some tea?

398
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,733
I know you just woke up
and all, but it would help.

399
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:36,650
Uh, sure!

400
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:38,400
Hey! Shirai!

401
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:40,525
[KUROKO] Listen, I completely
understand why you want to keep

402
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:43,525
your friend from getting hurt,
and I admire that.

403
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:45,567
But Uiharu is not
so fragile a girl

404
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,858
that this would
break her spirit.

405
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,150
[SATEN]
Mm.

406
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:54,650
[UIHARU]
Mind control? I see.

407
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:57,858
[UIHARU] So then, that means I
must've been sabotaging you guys

408
00:17:57,942 --> 00:17:59,525
without even realizing it.

409
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:01,150
[KUROKO slurps]

410
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:05,067
Okay. Now that
we've taken a break,

411
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,150
let's continue
our investigation.

412
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:09,400
Uiharu, please pick out
any suspicious individuals

413
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:10,442
from the Bank.

414
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:12,067
Huh? Is that smart?

415
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,358
What if I'm still under the mind
control they placed on me?

416
00:18:14,442 --> 00:18:17,192
I could accidentally lead
you in the wrong direction.

417
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:18,483
We don't have
the time for you to undergo

418
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:21,525
a thorough examination,
and we could really use

419
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:23,317
your expertise at the moment.

420
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,858
If you're concerned,
you can do all your work

421
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:27,150
in front of us so
we can keep tabs on you.

422
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:29,650
Unless you haven't
slept enough, of course.

423
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,692
I'm awake! I'll go get set up!

424
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:34,150
[SATEN]
That went well.

425
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:35,775
To be fair, both Shirai and I

426
00:18:35,858 --> 00:18:38,733
were under her mind
control, too, but...

427
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,400
...I'll keep that to myself.

428
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:41,733
[SHOKUHO]
All righty then...

429
00:18:41,817 --> 00:18:44,108
...you're free to go back
to your usual business.

430
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:49,067
The conference is up ahead.

431
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,567
The security on the way
there has been neutralized.

432
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,358
And that's where
Gensei Kihara is, right?

433
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:57,692
[SHOKUHO] If you promise
not to interfere at all,

434
00:18:57,775 --> 00:19:00,358
you can stay here
and watch if you'd like.

435
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:01,775
Are you kidding?

436
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:03,567
I'm sick of these people
who can't get anything done

437
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,775
without destroying lives.

438
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:08,025
Someone's gotta
teach them a lesson.

439
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:10,942
[SHOKUHO]
Hey! Wait up a second!

440
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,692
[MIKOTO] Level 6. A domain
that can't be reached

441
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:16,858
by existing abilities alone.

442
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:18,400
Something even
Accelerator would have to

443
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:22,442
sacrifice 20,000 clones
to get anywhere near.

444
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:24,650
Whatever Gensei Kihara
is planning,

445
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:28,650
it'll likely come at a cost
even greater than before.

446
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,733
But if he thinks
it'll be worth the price,

447
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:34,608
then he'll try. A godly brain.

448
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:36,317
If that's their goal,

449
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,650
then is this city
really just one big...?

450
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:40,192
Oh, come on!

451
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:42,358
I can't be preoccupied with that
when I'm about to charge

452
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,567
into enemy territory.

453
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,692
[gasps]

454
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:50,900
[MIKOTO]
Shokuho? She's gone.

455
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,733
The way here
was a straight shot.

456
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,733
She couldn't have gotten lost!

457
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:59,150
She set me up!
She must think she's so smooth.

458
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:02,025
You got me right where
you wanted me, what next?

459
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:04,233
You think I'm just gonna
lie down without a fight?

460
00:20:04,317 --> 00:20:06,233
[SHOKUHO wheezes]

461
00:20:06,317 --> 00:20:09,150
Hey. Hold on!

462
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:10,525
I told you...

463
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:12,608
...to wait a second.

464
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:13,817
[wheezing]

465
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,483
Don't just ignore me!

466
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:17,983
There's no way...

467
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,650
...you didn't hear that.

468
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:20,775
Don't go...

469
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:22,317
...getting fired up...

470
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,525
...without me.

471
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:26,900
I'm the one
who brought you here.

472
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:28,608
So it's only right...

473
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:30,192
...that we stick...

474
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:31,983
...together.

475
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:35,108
Don't go dashing
off at full speed.

476
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,525
Uh. That was more like jogging,
but sure, whatever.

477
00:20:38,608 --> 00:20:41,358
[SHOKUHO]
Yeah. Well.

478
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:42,608
You know how it is.

479
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:45,400
I am heavier in certain
areas than you are...

480
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:48,275
...so you have less wind
resistance to worry about.

481
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:51,358
You can imagine how
hard that must be, right?

482
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:52,692
[MIKOTO]
Yeah...

483
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:54,733
...you're just really out
of shape, aren't you?

484
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:58,692
[SHOKUHO]
Huh?! Excuse me?!

485
00:20:58,775 --> 00:20:59,858
I am the pinnacle of health!

486
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:01,400
Interesting.

487
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:02,650
Now that I think about it, I
don't remember ever seeing you

488
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:04,317
do anything in gym class.

489
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,650
Yeah, so?

490
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,567
You think being athletic
makes you a better person?

491
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,108
How old are you, ten?

492
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:12,233
Ahh. That explains why you have
the figure of a little girl!

493
00:21:12,317 --> 00:21:15,150
Ah! My figure has
nothing to do with this!

494
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,650
What about your sparkly eyes,
straight out of a Shojo manga?

495
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:18,858
[SHOKUHO]
I was born this way!

496
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:20,275
Didn't anyone ever teach you
not to make fun

497
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:21,692
of other's appearances?

498
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:22,858
[MIKOTO]
What do you think you just did?!

499
00:21:22,942 --> 00:21:23,858
You are such
a hypocritical little brat!

500
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:28,983
[overlapping yelling]

501
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:35,108
[BOTH panting]

502
00:21:35,192 --> 00:21:37,150
[SHOKUHO]
Whatever, this is pointless.

503
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:39,733
Bringing you along wasn't
part of my plan anyway.

504
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:41,233
Before our little
meeting today,

505
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:44,692
I had every intention of taking
care of things on my own.

506
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:46,108
So it's not like
we have to rush there

507
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:48,108
hand in hand, right?

508
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:50,025
Yeah. I think
I'd feel a lot better

509
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,775
if I wasn't forcing myself
to work with you.

510
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:54,775
[SHOKUHO, MIKOTO]
So why don't we just split up?

511
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,775
[SHOKUHO] Don't do anything
to slow me down, okay?

512
00:22:00,858 --> 00:22:02,275
[MIKOTO]
Right back at you!

513
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,900
[KOZAKU]
Let's see...

514
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:06,900
Why don't I summarize
what I've found?

515
00:22:06,983 --> 00:22:08,650
As far as the identity
of who stole the data

516
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:10,608
from our villas goes...

517
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:12,483
...it wasn't Mikoto Misaka.

518
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,775
It turns out it was the
fifth-ranked, Misaki Shokuho.

519
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:17,442
My guess is she
couldn't cover everything up

520
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:21,442
by manipulating memories, so
she had to set up a scapegoat.

521
00:22:21,525 --> 00:22:23,358
Also, she apparently knew about

522
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:27,150
the "do-not-kill" order on
Misaka that MEMBER sent out.

523
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:30,358
[KIHARA] Did you just now figure
this out, Mitori Kozaku?

524
00:22:30,442 --> 00:22:31,942
Huh? Hold on.

525
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:33,733
Does that mean
you knew that already?

526
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:35,733
You could have
told me, you know.

527
00:22:35,817 --> 00:22:37,025
[KIHARA]
What's the problem?

528
00:22:37,108 --> 00:22:39,150
It's not like me telling
you would have changed

529
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,608
your job at all.

530
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:44,025
Just focus on finishing your
preparations like before.

531
00:22:44,108 --> 00:22:45,150
Understood?

532
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:48,275
Okay. But are
you sure about this?

533
00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:50,733
I mean, Misaki Shokuho's
objective when she took

534
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:53,275
that data from the
villas was definitely--

535
00:22:53,358 --> 00:22:54,817
[KIHARA]
Yes, I'm sure.

536
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,025
No need to worry.
Everything is good to go.

537
00:22:58,108 --> 00:23:00,067
In fact...

538
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,858
...I'm almost afraid
things are going too smoothly.

539
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:00,400
[MIKOTO]
Okay, let's bust in there!

540
00:24:00,483 --> 00:24:02,817
You immobilize any security
guards, and I'll blast my way

541
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,775
through any walls
using my railgun!

542
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:06,817
[SHOKUHO] My Mental Out
doesn't work on Misaka.

543
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,650
At times like these, I wonder if
it's because of her EM barrier,

544
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:12,067
or if it's because her brain
is nothing but muscle.
