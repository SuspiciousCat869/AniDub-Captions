00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:41,858
[KUROKO sighs]

2
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,067
What's up?
What are you sighing about?

3
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,150
Only my crushed dreams.

4
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:48,650
I'm finally out of
that lonely hospital.

5
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:50,192
I should be making
up for the nights

6
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:53,650
I've spent without you, but no,
we can't sleep in our dorms.

7
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:55,150
No sense sulking.

8
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:57,483
It's just Tokiwadai's custom
for students to stay

9
00:00:57,567 --> 00:01:00,900
at a hotel with their families
during the Daihasei Festival.

10
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:03,150
[KUROKO]
Yes. I realize that.

11
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:04,692
I suppose I'll just
have to suffer

12
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:06,400
through nocturnal solitude.

13
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,733
On one condition.

14
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,983
As soon as the
festival is over...

15
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:12,442
...we will share a hot,
passionate night together.

16
00:01:12,525 --> 00:01:14,400
[smooching]

17
00:01:14,483 --> 00:01:17,108
Ugh.
Will you cut it out already?

18
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:18,400
[F STUDENT A]
Excuse me.

19
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:19,817
One extra-large, please.

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,358
[VENDOR] You got it!
Comin' right up. Just a second.

21
00:01:25,108 --> 00:01:28,608
[MIKOTO]
Oh, yeah. I wonder what she got.

22
00:01:28,692 --> 00:01:30,400
[KUROKO]
Sissy?

23
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:31,775
Oh, sorry.

24
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:32,942
Y'know what, Kuroko?

25
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:35,733
Is there any food you're
in the mood for?

26
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:37,900
If there is, it's my treat.

27
00:01:37,983 --> 00:01:39,858
We should get something
for Uiharu and Saten

28
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:41,025
while we're at it.

29
00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:42,775
I'm sure they'd like
a snack to munch on.

30
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:43,983
[KUROKO]
I can't decide.

31
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:45,483
But if it's a gift
from you, Sissy,

32
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:47,150
anything would be amazing.

33
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:49,858
Then again, if you're truly
offering me anything...

34
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:52,358
...I'd be a fool to not ask for
your half-eaten scra--

35
00:01:52,442 --> 00:01:53,608
[MIKOTO yells]

36
00:01:55,192 --> 00:01:58,025
Let's get to work!

37
00:01:58,108 --> 00:02:00,858
Man, it almost looks like
a war was fought here.

38
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:04,442
Hey, Uiharu?

39
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:07,400
The schedule says this stadium
won't be used again today.

40
00:02:07,483 --> 00:02:09,483
Which means I can
search all I want.

41
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:11,233
Just waiting on you
for some more info.

42
00:02:11,317 --> 00:02:12,442
I know.

43
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:13,858
I've already started
looking, don't worry.

44
00:02:13,942 --> 00:02:16,858
[SATEN] I wonder what
Shadow Metal even looks like.

45
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:19,567
Maybe it's in tiny little
particles, like gold dust.

46
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,900
Have you found any information
on the color or shape?

47
00:02:22,983 --> 00:02:25,567
Hmm. It's the strangest thing.

48
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,858
I'm getting a bizarrely
large number of results,

49
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:29,567
especially for this topic.

50
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,358
And yet there's nothing
but vague nonsense

51
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,983
written in any of them.

52
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:34,525
That is weird.

53
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:37,317
But like they say, where there's
smoke, there's fire, right?

54
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,275
If there's really
that many results,

55
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:41,108
there's gotta be
some truth to this.

56
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:42,900
[UIHARU]
How optimistic.

57
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:45,358
[SATEN]
All right! Here we go!

58
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:47,233
Let's find some Shadow Metal!

59
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:53,692
Y'know, these results
really are odd.

60
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:26,942
[SATEN]
Ugh.

61
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:29,775
I'm not finding anything
here that's metallic.

62
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:31,775
Unless this roasted pebble
is somehow a chunk

63
00:04:31,858 --> 00:04:34,108
of Shadow Metal in disguise.

64
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:36,608
Still nothing new
on my end, either.

65
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:38,692
And actually, no matter
how much I look,

66
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:41,567
I can't seem to find that
site you read about it on.

67
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,942
[SATEN]
Really? You sure?

68
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:44,108
That's weird.

69
00:04:44,192 --> 00:04:46,317
I was just on there
a week ago, I swear.

70
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,650
[gasps]

71
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,817
You understand what this means,
don't you, Kazari?

72
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,525
We're in the midst
of a conspiracy!

73
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:52,733
And how's that?

74
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:54,317
[SATEN] They say if you
look for Shadow Metal,

75
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,275
you end up targeted by
a mysterious organization!

76
00:04:57,358 --> 00:04:58,650
What if they shut down
the site because

77
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,233
we're getting too close
to the truth?

78
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:02,192
Oh. I can see you're working.

79
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:03,858
I came to drop off Kuroko.

80
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:07,650
Hey, would it be okay for me
to kill some time here

81
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,317
before my next event starts?

82
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,942
[SATEN] That's gotta be it.
I mean, what else could it be?

83
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:13,733
We have to get a move
on or the organization

84
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:15,108
will get to it first!

85
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:16,650
Makes sense.

86
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,608
But hold on, Saten, if these
people actually exist,

87
00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:21,817
doesn't that mean you're
in considerable danger

88
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,275
right now?

89
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:25,483
Do my ears deceive me or
is she causing trouble again?

90
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:27,233
Huh? Danger?

91
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:29,400
[UIHARU] If an organization
that's willing to manipulate

92
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:31,567
public data to
monopolize Shadow Metal

93
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,400
found you searching for it,
you'd be in a tight spot.

94
00:05:34,483 --> 00:05:36,192
Don't say that, Uiharu.

95
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:38,067
You're starting to freak me out.

96
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,483
I know, I'm sorry,
I was just kidding.

97
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:43,317
But that's what you get for
always flipping up my skirt.

98
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,567
Boo.

99
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:48,192
Who are you--?
Hey! Wait--!

100
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:51,608
Are you okay?
Saten, is everything okay?

101
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:52,900
What happened?

102
00:05:52,983 --> 00:05:53,817
[UIHARU] I don't know,
but it sounded like Saten

103
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,983
was attacked by someone!

104
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:56,567
Uiharu, where is she?

105
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,733
School District 18,
the Kirigaoka grounds!

106
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,483
Sissy, let's go.

107
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:02,525
I'm coming--

108
00:06:02,608 --> 00:06:04,108
[KUROKO]
You stay here to back us up.

109
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:05,483
Depending on what we find there,

110
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,525
we might need you at
the ready to contact Antiskill.

111
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:10,025
--But I--!
--[MIKOTO] Uiharu.

112
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,317
We've got this.

113
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:21,650
[SATEN grunts]

114
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:24,442
All right! All right, already,
just let me go!

115
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:28,192
[SATEN]
Stop it, that hurts!

116
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:31,108
Will you get off?

117
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:33,025
Wait, they look like...

118
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:34,233
What do you think you're doing?

119
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:36,692
--Uh, Sissy? Hang on--
--Let her go!

120
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:39,608
[SATEN, MIKOTO]
We're so sorry!

121
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:44,108
We're just doing our jobs.

122
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:46,025
We secure the school
grounds and prep rooms,

123
00:06:46,108 --> 00:06:48,442
and thoroughly clean
them after each use.

124
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:50,692
You never know, some shady
character might show up

125
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:54,608
and try to collect samples
of high-level esper DNA.

126
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:58,525
In fact, we've stopped plenty
of attempts to do just that.

127
00:06:58,608 --> 00:07:00,025
So think about it.

128
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:03,317
If we find someone suspicious,
we can't just let 'em go.

129
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,442
And I haven't even
mentioned you attacking us.

130
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,692
[SATEN]
You're absolutely right.

131
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:08,900
[MIKOTO]
We really screwed up!

132
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:11,483
If you've learned your lesson,
I'll let you off with a warning.

133
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:13,442
[SATEN]
Excuse me.

134
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:16,525
Totally unrelated, but have you
ever heard of Shadow Metal?

135
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:18,108
--[M WORKER A] Huh?
--Saten...

136
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:21,775
[SATEN] Not even the guys
who clean up after the festival

137
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,358
events have seen it.

138
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:25,567
[KUROKO] It sounds like the
Shadow Metal rumors started

139
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,067
because people were suspicious
of the tight security

140
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,942
around school grounds
that was meant to prevent

141
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:31,942
the leaking of DNA maps.

142
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:35,358
The power of the human
imagination strikes again.

143
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:37,858
This is precisely the reason
I told you not to get

144
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:40,400
caught up in wild
hearsay like this.

145
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:41,775
Yeah, I'm sorry.

146
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:43,192
[KUROKO]
You, too, Sissy!

147
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:44,358
Sorry I freaked out.

148
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:45,900
[KUROKO] See?
Was that so hard? Really?

149
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:47,692
If you two would just pay
attention to what I tell you

150
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:49,900
every day, you wouldn't
have these problems!

151
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:51,150
[UIHARU sighs]

152
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,567
I'm just glad that
everyone's safe and sound.

153
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,858
Sometimes I forget how much
of a troublemaker Saten can be.

154
00:07:58,733 --> 00:07:59,692
Oh, yeah.

155
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:05,317
These search results really
are abnormal, aren't they?

156
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,150
Is it possible someone spread
all of this dummy data

157
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:10,150
online in the last week

158
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:13,233
to keep anyone from finding
what Saten found?

159
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:15,650
Or maybe to conceal some
embarrassing information

160
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:17,192
that was on the site?

161
00:08:17,275 --> 00:08:18,400
Yeah right.

162
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:20,525
I guess Saten's starting
to rub off on me.

163
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:25,483
Although, if this dummy data

164
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:28,150
is something that was
automatically generated,

165
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:30,483
then by analyzing its pattern,
I may be able

166
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:33,275
to recreate the original site.

167
00:08:33,358 --> 00:08:35,150
That's a tall order, but...

168
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:37,900
"Boom."

169
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:42,692
[KEITZ]
Well, well. Curious.

170
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:44,067
[UIHARU]
Yup.

171
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,442
This is exactly the kind
of site Saten told me about.

172
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:49,400
But I'm not seeing anything
on here worth hiding.

173
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:51,233
The information it has
on Shadow Metal

174
00:08:51,317 --> 00:08:53,317
is pretty much what
Saten already told me.

175
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:59,108
"A very valuable orange."
"Disciplinary Guides."

176
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:02,192
"A DNA computer that
produces abilities"?

177
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:06,400
Huh?

178
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:08,692
Isn't the person
in this picture...?

179
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:12,817
We're back.

180
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,358
[UIHARU]
Hi everyone!

181
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:16,775
[SATEN] Ugh. Sorry about
all this, Misaka.

182
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:17,983
Hey.

183
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:19,858
I acted without thinking
things through, too.

184
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:21,733
We're both to blame,
I can't judge.

185
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:24,483
Sorry I dragged you
into this too, Uiharu.

186
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,858
I'm just happy
everything worked out.

187
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,733
[SATEN] So, have you
found anything new out

188
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:30,150
--since we last--
--[MIKOTO, KUROKO] Stop it!

189
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:31,775
[KUROKO] How have you
not learned your lesson?

190
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:33,233
[SATEN]
I, uh...

191
00:09:33,317 --> 00:09:34,775
Well...

192
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:37,483
I did look into it on my own
after everything calmed down,

193
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:40,567
though I didn't find
anything worth mentioning.

194
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,567
But I did find some good
intel that's totally unrelated.

195
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,692
It turns out there's a secret
spot where we can get

196
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:48,442
an up close and personal view
of the night parade fireworks!

197
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:49,942
[SATEN]
Whoa. Really?

198
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:52,692
[KUROKO] Is this location
somewhere we can legally get to?

199
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,442
[UIHARU]
Yup! It's just not well known.

200
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:55,775
I made sure to double check.

201
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:57,692
[MIKOTO]
Oh, yeah? That sounds nice.

202
00:09:57,775 --> 00:09:58,858
Let's check it out!

203
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:29,317
[KUROKO]
They're so pretty.

204
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,692
[SATEN] They do this every night
during the Daihasei Festival,

205
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:32,650
right?

206
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,775
[UIHARU]
Mm-hmm. That's right.

207
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:38,358
Then... Let's all
do this again, okay?

208
00:10:38,442 --> 00:10:39,567
--[SATEN, UIHARU] Yeah!
--[KUROKO] Okay!

209
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:47,192
[MIKOTO yawns]

210
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:49,108
I just can't get a good
night's sleep without

211
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:50,733
my own pillow.

212
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,358
[F TOKIWADAI B]
So, where's the Queen?

213
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:54,733
[KOBAYASHI] No one has
seen her since last night.

214
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:58,317
Oh. Misaka, good morning.

215
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,858
Yeah, right back at you.

216
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:02,483
[F TOKIWADAI 02B]
What does that mean, then?

217
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:05,192
[MIKOTO] I think they're
a part of Shokuho's clique.

218
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:06,817
[WANNAI]
Misaka.

219
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,400
[MIKOTO]
Hey, Wannai. Morning.

220
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:10,150
Good morning to you, too.

221
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:11,608
So, um...

222
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:14,150
I don't mean to sound like
I'm rushing you or anything,

223
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:16,483
but when can I expect
my gym clothes back?

224
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:17,567
Gym clothes?

225
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:22,858
Huh?! She hasn't come
to return them yet?

226
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:24,025
[WANNAI]
Pardon?

227
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:27,775
I'm sorry! I mean...
Uh... Coffee!

228
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:29,358
I spilled coffee on them!

229
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:30,900
And even if I had them cleaned,

230
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:33,025
there would still be a stain,
so let me buy you new ones.

231
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:35,192
I'll order another set
for you right now!

232
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:36,567
Oh, please!

233
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,733
You really don't need
to go to all that trouble!

234
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:43,358
[MISUZU]
Oh, Tabikake.

235
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:45,275
[MIKOTO] A whole night has
passed and she hasn't returned

236
00:11:45,358 --> 00:11:46,692
them yet?

237
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:49,817
What, is she pretending
to be me so she can goof off?

238
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,942
No. She wouldn't do that.

239
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:56,567
I've got... a bad feeling
about this.

240
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,567
[MIKOTO]
Okay.

241
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,067
I found the surveillance
cameras near where we

242
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,608
split up yesterday.

243
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:08,233
If I look through
the recordings,

244
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:12,275
I should be able
to follow her trail.

245
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:14,067
Nothing here. Next.

246
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:17,442
Good thing I have
some free time today.

247
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:23,400
Maybe I'm getting
worried over nothing.

248
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:25,983
But then again,
those girls' bodies do need

249
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:29,400
regular maintenance
to keep healthy.

250
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:31,358
So if something
happened to her...

251
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:38,650
An ambulance?

252
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:44,192
[MIKOTO]
There she is. That's her!

253
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:46,442
She's passed out.
Is she hurt, or sick?

254
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:50,150
This is not the time
to get emotional.

255
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:53,150
Which jurisdiction is this?

256
00:12:58,692 --> 00:12:59,900
[MIKOTO]
Found it.

257
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:02,275
This should be the
ambulance from the footage.

258
00:13:02,358 --> 00:13:03,608
[MIKOTO]
Excuse me!

259
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:05,317
--Huh?
--Huh?

260
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,733
I've got a question.
Who was driving this yesterday?

261
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:11,275
Yesterday?
That would be the two of us.

262
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:12,775
'Kay, then a follow-up.

263
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,567
Did you transport a girl
with shoulder-length

264
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,858
brownish hair a
little before noon?

265
00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:18,483
Oh, that girl.

266
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:21,942
Yeah, come to think
of it, we did.

267
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:24,442
Really? That girl is
a friend of mine.

268
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:25,983
Could you please
tell me which hospital

269
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:28,317
you took her to so
I can go check on her?

270
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,317
It's that one there.

271
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,983
It's not far. See it?

272
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:35,983
[MIKOTO] Wait, that's where the
real-life Gekota doctor works.

273
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:38,692
He knows about the
situation with the Sisters.

274
00:13:39,942 --> 00:13:41,192
[MIKOTO]
Thank you very much!

275
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:46,692
[MIKOTO] If they took her there,
I'm sure she's fine.

276
00:13:48,317 --> 00:13:50,567
[MIKOTO] Huh? You mean
she wasn't brought here?

277
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,483
No. We have no records
of any emergency cases

278
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:54,942
around that time.

279
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:57,900
But the EMTs said this is
where they dropped her off!

280
00:13:57,983 --> 00:13:59,317
[F STAFF A] Perhaps they
confused us with

281
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,900
another hospital.

282
00:14:02,817 --> 00:14:05,525
[M WORKER C] No. I'm pretty
certain that's the place.

283
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:08,608
[M WORKER B] Yeah. We definitely
took her to that hospital.

284
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:10,608
But they said they don't
have any record of--

285
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:14,067
[MIKOTO]
Wait, something's wrong.

286
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,942
She was wearing gym
clothes from Tokiwadai.

287
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:18,608
If these guys are
telling the truth,

288
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,192
then no matter
what hospital it was,

289
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:22,150
they would have
contacted the school.

290
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:24,317
But it's the next day and I
haven't heard from anyone,

291
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,150
let alone the school.

292
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,067
Excuse me,
but is that the truth?

293
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,400
[M WORKER C]
Yeah?

294
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:30,858
Then can you tell me the
name of the hospital staff

295
00:14:30,942 --> 00:14:32,483
you turned her over to,
or anything else

296
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:33,942
that may have happened?

297
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:37,317
Of course we can.
We, uh... Huh?

298
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:40,483
[M WORKER B]
What are you, senile?

299
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:41,942
Remember, we... huh?

300
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:44,275
[M WORKER C]
Hey!

301
00:14:44,358 --> 00:14:46,400
[MIKOTO] I'll just check the
ambulance's route history.

302
00:14:48,317 --> 00:14:49,358
[MIKOTO]
I knew it.

303
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:50,817
They didn't go to the hospital.

304
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,150
They went to an underground
parking garage and back!

305
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,108
[M WORKER B]
Hey, get out of there!

306
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:56,900
[MIKOTO] She was taken there
in this ambulance.

307
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:59,483
Did they move her to
a different vehicle then?

308
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,692
So, where is she now--?

309
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,233
What's going on?
Why did you lie?

310
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:05,483
From what it's showing here
in your route history,

311
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:07,442
you never even went
to the hospital!

312
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:10,400
I get the feeling you won't
be able to explain that one.

313
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:11,567
Well that can't be right.

314
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,483
You're lying to me
and I have proof!

315
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:15,150
You can't talk your way
out of this!

316
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:18,608
Huh? You're the girl
from yesterday.

317
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:20,150
What's the big idea?

318
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:22,317
We bring you to the hospital
and now that you've recovered

319
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,817
you show up and
start calling us liars?

320
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,108
What? No way!

321
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,150
I'm just--!

322
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:28,608
[M WORKER B]
Hold on.

323
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:31,025
I thought I'd seen you before,
and now I know where.

324
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:33,025
You're that Level 5, right?

325
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:35,608
The one that controls
electricity or whatever.

326
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:37,442
How do we know you
didn't use your ability

327
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:39,400
to tamper with the route
history yourself?

328
00:15:39,483 --> 00:15:40,650
What are you--?

329
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:43,400
There's no way I'd
do something like that!

330
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:45,817
I'm sorry for keeping
my identity a secret.

331
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,483
But stop lying to me!

332
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,150
Tell me what really happened!

333
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:50,567
[M WORKER B]
But I'm not lying, I swear!

334
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,983
If you're not lying,

335
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,942
then why don't you have any
memory of what happened?

336
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:55,400
Everything you've told me is--

337
00:15:56,692 --> 00:15:59,192
[MIKOTO]
Memory? Tampering?

338
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:00,317
Was it...?

339
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:04,358
[M ANTISKILL A]
You! Take your hands off him!

340
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,025
[SATEN]
She's lookin' pretty dead.

341
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:11,942
Is everything okay?

342
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:13,900
Well, she knows she has
five more nights away

343
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:15,483
from Misaka ahead of her.

344
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:18,442
She told me before it's
sapping her will to live.

345
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:20,858
Ah, that explains it.

346
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,608
[KUROKO]
Uiharu?

347
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:28,025
You realize this street isn't
on our patrol route,

348
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:29,525
don't you?

349
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:31,442
Huh? What do you mean?
That's not true.

350
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:32,942
I remember this was...

351
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,692
[KUROKO]
Look at the map.

352
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:36,608
[UIHARU]
Whoa. You're right.

353
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:38,150
Honestly.

354
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:39,692
If you're going to tell someone
they're wrong about something,

355
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:42,317
you should at least be
certain about it yourself.

356
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,608
[UIHARU] How could I have
made that mistake?

357
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:45,692
[SATEN]
Don't beat yourself up.

358
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:47,442
We can go back easy enough.

359
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:49,900
[KEITZ]
Sorry to bother you.

360
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:51,358
I noticed the armband.

361
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:52,567
Are you with Judgment?

362
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,942
Yes. That's right.

363
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:55,525
So, I'm not from around here.

364
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:57,608
I only came to see the festival.

365
00:16:57,692 --> 00:17:00,025
And I just got
robbed over there.

366
00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:02,817
Oh, no! That's awful!

367
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,733
What did they take from you?

368
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:06,608
[SATEN] Turns out taking the
wrong route was a good thing

369
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,775
after all.

370
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:09,733
All right, there's
no need to be cheeky.

371
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:10,942
[SATEN laughs]

372
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:16,108
[UIHARU]
I can't...

373
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:17,608
[SATEN]
...move.

374
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:19,400
[KUROKO]
Or teleport.

375
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:22,858
What was taken? Let's see.

376
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,483
Your memories of Mikoto Misaka.

377
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:26,650
How's that?

378
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:31,358
[WATANABE] I really am
terribly sorry about this!

379
00:17:31,442 --> 00:17:34,483
Come on, let's go.

380
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:38,192
For goodness sake,
what were you thinking?

381
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:40,692
Very nearly committing
assault while trying to prank

382
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:42,150
a public agency?

383
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:43,983
You realize how lucky you are?

384
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:45,692
They didn't have to be
so accommodating.

385
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:47,775
They could have pressed
charges against you.

386
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,900
What brought on
this erratic behavior?

387
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:53,400
[MIKOTO] While waiting for
Ms. Watanabe to arrive,

388
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:56,400
I tried asking all kinds
of trick questions,

389
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:58,608
but they didn't seem
like they were lying.

390
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:00,692
Which supports my theory.

391
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:02,317
Wanna know the truth?

392
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,567
I think Misaki Shokuho
is using her ability

393
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,108
to cover up a crime.

394
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:07,983
If that accusation
has any merit,

395
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:09,817
this is a serious matter.

396
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,858
Do you have any evidence that
led you to that conclusion?

397
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:15,108
Well, I...

398
00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:16,608
No.

399
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:18,858
Any way I explain this, I'll
have to mention the Sisters.

400
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:22,692
I know this doesn't help,

401
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:25,150
but I really can't give
you any specifics.

402
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:27,650
Then that makes it difficult
for me to do anything.

403
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:33,650
Misaka, the Daihasei Festival
is going on.

404
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:38,025
The entire world's attention
is on Academy City right now.

405
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:40,442
As a Level 5, you must
conduct yourself not only

406
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:42,358
as a representative
of our school,

407
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:44,942
but of all of Academy City.

408
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:47,025
I realize that's a tremendous
amount of pressure

409
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:49,567
to put on you, but we must
be more careful

410
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,858
about your hasty actions
than ever before.

411
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:54,942
Do you understand?

412
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:55,983
[MIKOTO]
Yes.

413
00:18:57,775 --> 00:18:59,233
[MIKOTO]
I don't get it.

414
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:02,900
If Shokuho manipulated the EMTs
to use them as traffickers,

415
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:05,233
what was her objective?

416
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:07,942
Ugh. I need more info.

417
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:11,192
As soon as the events
start up again, I'll slip out.

418
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,108
For now, the underground
parking garage

419
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:15,817
where the ambulance
went is my only lead.

420
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,775
[WATANABE]
Oh, this works out perfectly.

421
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:22,233
Ladies, could I ask you
for a favor?

422
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:24,650
You see, Misaka is
feeling unusually anxious

423
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,275
at the moment,
so I'd like for you

424
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:28,317
to keep your eyes on her.

425
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,483
[F STUDENT B]
Sure. No problem.

426
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:31,567
[MIKOTO]
Guards?

427
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,525
And of all people.

428
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:36,442
Misaki Shokuho's clique?

429
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:39,108
My... isn't this nice?

430
00:19:39,192 --> 00:19:41,525
Misaka, I've always wanted
to sit down and have

431
00:19:41,608 --> 00:19:44,108
a nice, long chat with you.

432
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:46,067
I'm looking forward to it.

433
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,650
[MIKOTO]
Uh... Yeah.

434
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,608
You should really try not
to cause so much trouble

435
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:51,275
for our teachers.

436
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,525
You do have a history
of being mischievous.

437
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:56,400
[MIKOTO]
Aww, man. This is gonna suck.

438
00:19:56,483 --> 00:19:58,692
[KOBAYASHI]
Misaka?

439
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:00,733
[MIKOTO]
Was that telepathy?

440
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:02,233
[KOBAYASHI] Since I'm
going to be watching you,

441
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:05,692
I've opened a direct
line between us.

442
00:20:05,775 --> 00:20:07,150
While this line is connected,

443
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:09,525
I will be able to track
your general location.

444
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,608
I think it's only fair
I tell you now.

445
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:14,775
If you run away,
I regret to inform you

446
00:20:14,858 --> 00:20:17,317
that we will do everything
in our power to stop you.

447
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:20,483
You may start driving.

448
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:21,692
[M DRIVER A]
Yes, ma'am.

449
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:25,233
[WATANABE]
I am sorry, Misaka.

450
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,567
It wasn't my intent to put
a damper on things.

451
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,650
Especially not during the
long-awaited Daihasei Festival.

452
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:35,192
However, Misaki Shokuho's
"Optimization" is absolute.

453
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:39,817
[MIKOTO] I know I could shake
them off if I really tried.

454
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,067
Or, at least I think so.

455
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:45,025
But gathering more
information while on the run

456
00:20:45,108 --> 00:20:46,650
will be really difficult.

457
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:51,942
[MIKOTO] I don't sense any
open hostility from the girls

458
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:53,400
in the clique.

459
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:55,817
Does that mean that Shokuho
hasn't told them anything?

460
00:20:58,233 --> 00:20:59,275
[MIKOTO]
Is that...

461
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,317
Kuroko! Uiharu and Saten, too!

462
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,275
Uh, would it be okay
if I talked to my friends

463
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:05,317
really quick?

464
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,817
I won't run, promise.

465
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,192
[F STUDENT D]
Huh? Okay.

466
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:09,858
[MIKOTO]
I can't say too much.

467
00:21:09,942 --> 00:21:12,192
I'll try to get them to help
without being obvious.

468
00:21:13,692 --> 00:21:16,733
[MIKOTO] Hey, Kuroko!
I need a little favor from you.

469
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:19,900
[KUROKO]
Excuse me.

470
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:22,067
Don't you think it's kind of
inappropriate to shout my name

471
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,192
out to the world?

472
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:24,942
It's a little overfamiliar.

473
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:27,233
Hey, Shirai, is this a friend
of yours or something?

474
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:28,942
Not at all.

475
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:32,650
This is Mikoto Misaka, she's an
upperclassman at my school.

476
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:34,858
Oh. Yeah, you're famous!

477
00:21:34,942 --> 00:21:36,275
What do they call you again?

478
00:21:36,358 --> 00:21:37,775
"Railgun" or something?

479
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:41,025
Uh, Kuroko. This is a joke.

480
00:21:41,108 --> 00:21:43,567
You're all just trying
to pull my leg, right?

481
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,275
No idea what you're
talking about.

482
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:48,608
[MIKOTO]
Right, Uiharu? Saten?

483
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:51,150
That's weird, why would
she know our names?

484
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:53,025
[UIHARU] I imagine Shirai
must have told her.

485
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:54,192
I didn't.

486
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:56,775
We aren't even acquainted.
I couldn't have.

487
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,150
Listen, I don't know
where you heard about

488
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,983
the three of us, or who
told you all of our names.

489
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:02,858
But if you need help,
or you're in trouble,

490
00:22:02,942 --> 00:22:04,358
I'll hear you out.

491
00:22:04,442 --> 00:22:06,900
I am a member of Judgment.

492
00:22:06,983 --> 00:22:09,275
No. That's okay.

493
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:17,150
[MIKOTO] You've really
done it now, Shokuho!

494
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:20,775
You've decided to mess
with my friends' heads?

495
00:22:20,858 --> 00:22:23,317
How dare you?

496
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,775
This goes way beyond
just screwing around!

497
00:23:58,858 --> 00:24:00,775
[MIKOTO] Shokuho, what do
you think you're doing,

498
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:02,567
tampering with my
friends' memories?

499
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,150
Not to mention having
your clique stand guard

500
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:06,608
over me and keeping me
from finding that sister!

501
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:08,025
I gotta do something.

502
00:24:08,108 --> 00:24:10,942
[KONGO] Misaka, allow me,
Mitsuko Kongo,

503
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:12,400
--to deal with this!
--[MIKOTO] Huh?
