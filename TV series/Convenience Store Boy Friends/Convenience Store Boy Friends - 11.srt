was born with a weak heart.

She'd originally planned
to take some time off

before summer,
but things got too busy.

63

After much deliberation,
her doctor recommended surgery.

We wanted to wait a bit
to see how things went.

It was that serious?

[MIHARU'S MOM] I told her that
surgery was her best option

to regain her health,
and the sooner the better.

But she kept insisting
we postpone it.

[MIHARU'S MOM]
Misora! [sobs]

163
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,625
[NURSE 11A]
This way, please.

164
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,125
[MIHARU whimpers]

165

--[door latch clacks]
--Good, you're finally back!

166
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,250
Guess what?
We're having hamburgers!

167
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:14,250
[HARUKI] Sorry, Let Mom know
I'll be skipping dinner tonight.

168
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,750
[AKIRA]
Huh?

169
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,583
'Kay...

[AKIRA sighs]

171
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:43,708
[HARUKI] That book, it didn't
belong to me originally.

172
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,583
There was a girl
who read it to me,

173
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,708
and then she let me have it.

174
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:51,250
And since then,
it's stayed in my mind.

175
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:55,333
Because of that, she's always
been special to me.

176
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,333
[HARUKI gasps]

177
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,458
Are you possibly...?

178
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,625
[TOWA]
Hey, I'm here.

179
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,041
[HARUKI]
Towa?

180
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,375
Called ya, why didn't
you answer your phone?

181
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,958
[HARUKI] Sorry.
I guess I didn't hear it.

182
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,708
[TOWA]
Whatever, it's fine.

183
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:26,958
[TOWA]
Here you go.

184
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,375
Thanks, man.

185
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,000
So, um, I had a talk
with Nasa today.

186
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,875
The girl who gave
that book to you...

187
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,833
--Yeah, I know.
--Huh?

188
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,000
[HARUKI]
It was Misora, Miharu's sister.

189
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,375
Yeah.

190
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,083
Towa, I get it now.

191
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,666
See, it all makes sense.

192
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,416
All my memories of her are
also the most important ones.

193
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,916
But that's why I've always
thought about Miharu.

194
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,916
If I didn't have those memories,

195
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,250
I would never have had
the guts to talk to her.

196
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:04,500
We took a walk in the park,
had ice cream, we laughed.

197
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,125
Without experiences like that,

198
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,041
I never would have
known or understood

199
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,208
how it felt, to feel like this.

200
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:21,583
I like her.
I like Miharu Mashiki.

201
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,000
I've never seen you
be this open before.

202
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,125
When Miharu wakes up,
you'd better tell her.

203
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,916
And don't you dare
hold back now.

204
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,083
Say it all.

[CLERK 11A]
Welcome, come in!

[HARUKI]
Coming in.

Haruki Mishima,
new second-year student.

210
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,958
And I really like
swimming a lot.

214
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,500
Good morning.

Hey, you're awake!

[HARUKI]
Oh, yeah. Are you hungry?

217
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,250
I brought some food,
just in case.

218
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,500
But I didn't know
what you might want,

219
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,625
so I just picked up a
bunch of random things

220
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,541
at the convenience store.

221

Have you been here
this whole time?

Well, I, uh...

[HARUKI]
Oh, no. What's wrong?

226
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,708
Should I go and get a doctor?

[MIHARU sobs]

228
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,666
I can't eat all this by myself.

00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,916
Uh...

230
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,791

so I can stand by your side,

of your voice.
