[HARUKI]
And here it is.

4
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,833
[HARUKI, MIHARU] This is the
place where our story begins.

5
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,083
Breakfast is ready!

6
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,833
Come on, get up!

7
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,250
Okay, okay. I'm getting up now.

8
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,875
Towa's here? Again?

9
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:45,416
[HARUKI]
We're off.

10
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
[TOWA]
See you later.

11
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,625
Man, my neck is killing me.

12
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,833
Well, you did sleep
on the floor.

13
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,166
Yeah, good point.

14
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,833
How 'bout the bed
next time, huh?

15
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:56,958
Fat chance.

16
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,166
Fine, jerk.

17
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,666
[TOWA] Oh, yeah.
Brazil's playing today.

18
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,375
I should make plans to
watch it with your brother.

19
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,916
[HARUKI]
You mean at my place?

20
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,166
[TOWA] Yeah, and the European
League is on CS at midnight.

21
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,833
[HARUKI]
You're staying over again?

22
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,791
You'd better make sure
you let my mom know.

23
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:23,916
[TOWA]
Yeah, I will.

24
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,375
There's an unusual number
of students around for a Sunday.

25
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,333
Because it isn't Sunday.

26
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,708
[TOWA]
Heh. Look at that!

27
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,916
[HARUKI] Man, these high-school
clubs really go all out

28
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,958
to recruit new members,
don't they.

29
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,541
[chuckles]
It's practically a carnival.

30
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,833
You going out for soccer?

31
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,291
Think I'm gonna
head right to the pool.

32
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,208
Will you please stop
being such a loser?

33
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,666
Just wait and hang
with me a little longer.

34
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,708
[HARUKI]
What?

35
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,791
Hey, guys! How do you feel about
joining the handicraft club?

36
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,750
We could use some
new blood around here.

37
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,333
Uh, handi-what, now?

38
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,333
Yeah, I don't think it's for me.

39
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,541
[HANDICRAFT CLUB GIRL]
Aw, come on!

40
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,041
What are you guys afraid of?
It'll be great.

41
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,875
Okay! We've got two
new men on board now!

42

--[TOWA] What the--
--[HARUKI] Hang on--

43

[MASAMUNE]
Hey, Handicraft.

44
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,416
Eee... Mr. Sakurakoji!

45
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,375
Dishonest recruitment
tactics are strictly forbidden.

46
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,750
That's a yellow card.

[MASAMUNE]
All right, listen up.

50
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,541
Don't be such an easy target,
or you're gonna end up

51
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,333
in every club on campus.

52
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,000
You got that?

53
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,625
--[TOWA] Okay.
--[HARUKI] Uh, 'kay.

54
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,916
[MIKADO] Hey, lighten up, man.
Don't scare them.

55
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But Mikado--

56
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,875
You interested in liberal arts?

57
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,000
'Cause if not, you should
try checking out

58
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,291
the school grounds or the gym.

59
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,125
A lot of clubs are pretty
aggressive, so be careful.

60
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,583
Those dudes are weird.

61
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,708
I hope I don't end up
on their radar.

62
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,583
Aw, don't worry about it.

63
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,750
S'not like they're not
gonna do anything to us.

64
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,083
Besides, the handicraft
club was scarier.

65
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,333
Yeah, you got that right.

66
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,958
[HARUKI]
Don't you have soccer now?

67
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,125
--[TOWA] Yup.
--[HARUKI] Well,

68
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,750
guess I'll see you later, then.

[TOWA] Hey. Let's meet up

I'm terribly sorry.

78

[MIHARU]
I didn't look where I was going.

79
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,458
It was my fault.

[MIHARU]
No, don't be sorry.

[coughing]

100
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,333
Come on, Haruki,
reacting that way every time

101
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,541
is getting really old.

102
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,541
But I keep telling you,
she's not like that.

103
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,875
[TOWA]
That excuse is getting old, too.

104

Ugh, well, it's not like you're
making a move or anything.

105

[TOWA]
Real talk, buddy.

106

I know you take that
kind of thing seriously,

107
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,375
but if you never
practice using it,

108
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,625
you won't be able to
when the time comes.

more important things

Do you know any guys like that?
