be gone a little while.

You can come back
when it's done.

Huh?

31
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:05,458
You see, it's being done
at a different hospital.

miss so much school.

gonna miss her, you know that?

it in this whole time.

But, I still couldn't
say anything.

[HARUKI]
Again.

53
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,291
Then you'd better tell
her the truth, and quick.

54
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,666
So she doesn't have to
cry in secret anymore.

'I may not ever see her

'I don't want that!'
