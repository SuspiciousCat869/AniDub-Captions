1
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:22,666
[MAMI] Towa, how did you
know about this place?

2
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,625
You've been wanting
to try it, haven't you?

3
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:29,750
[TOWA]
Hey!

4
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,500
Class rep, you like
this kinda stuff?

5
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,791
Oh, you remember that?

6
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:35,833
[TOWA]
Yeah.

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,416
That's why we're here now.

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,625
So, let's eat!

9
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,375
Thank you!
Please come again soon!

10
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,250
[TOWA]
Did you like it?

11
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,125
[MAMI]
Yes.

12
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,833
[TOWA]
I rule at dates!

13
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,333
But it would have been
nice if you had shared

14
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:04,083
a little bit of
your cake with me.

15
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:06,375
You wouldn't even let
me have, like, one bite.

16
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:07,833
Well, no. Of course not.

17
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:10,083
But why couldn't I?

18
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:12,083
[MAMI]
What do you mean?

19
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,791
Because you just can't.

20
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,333
Aw, you're no fun.

21
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:18,708
I was really hoping to
try some of your cake.

22
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:21,041
You always say weird
things like that.

23
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:27,125
[TOWA laughs]

24
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:28,791
[MAMI laughs]

25
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,000
[phone vibrates]

26
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,541
[MAMI]
My curfew.

27
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:37,875
Sorry, I gotta go.

28
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,208
Is this enough?

29
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,291
[TOWA]
Huh? Hang on.

30
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,416
[MAMI]
Bye.

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,041
[TOWA] Wait a sec!
I'll walk you home.

32
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,166
[MAMI]
It's fine.

33
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,208
I'll see you later.

34
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,125
Thank you. This was nice.

35
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:59,333
[MAMI] I'm sorry,
things ran a little bit late.

36
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,583
Yes, I know.

37
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,166
I'm on my way home now.

38
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,208
[phone vibrates]

39
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,625
[HARUKI]
You had cake?

40
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,958
[TOWA]
Yeah, and it was awesome.

41
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,041
Check it out.

42
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,583
How manly of you.

43
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,416
Oh, whatever.

44
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,083
I just wish we could have spent
some more time together, though.

45
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,333
Yeah, that's nice.

46
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,250
Thanks for all the support.

47
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,583
I'm telling you, I wanna
be with her all the time.

48
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,208
She even answers my texts
really fast lately.

49
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,750
What a breakthrough.

50
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,791
[TOWA]
Jealous, bro?

51
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:12,833
[HARUKI]
Bite me.

52
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,291
[MIHARU]
You had cake?

53
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,583
[MAMI]
Mm-hmm.

54
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,541
Well that sounds
like a lovely date.

55
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,083
Really, you think so?

56
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,333
[MIHARU]
Definitely.

57
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,750
[MAMI]
Yeah, it was.

58
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,625
[TOWA] Class rep, do you
have time for tea later?

59
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,666
Maybe?

60
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,833
I need to go
to the bookstore.

61
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,208
Then I'll walk you there.

62
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,375
[MAMI]
I'd like that.

63
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,458
[horn blares]

64
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,625
[MAMI]
Actually, I have to go, sorry!

65
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,416
[TOWA]
Morning, class rep.

66
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,083
Yeah, good morning.

67
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,208
[TOWA]
Hey, uh...

68
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,750
[MAMI]
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,958
[TOWA]
It's okay.

70
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,458
So, uh...

71
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,416
It was my brother.

72
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,541
He passed by and saw us.

73
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,583
Hang on. Did he
give you a hard time?

74
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,916
No, he didn't.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,875
Don't worry, it wasn't
anything that serious.

76
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:46,916
But...

77
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,458
[TOWA] She says we can't walk
home together for a while.

78
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,708
[HARUKI]
No wonder they're worried.

79
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,125
She's hanging out with you.

80
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,291
Mami's family?

81
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,250
They run a big florist.

82
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,125
Everybody knows them.

83
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,333
[TOWA]
Oh, really?

84
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,833
I had no idea.

85
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:07,041
[MIHARU] Not only that, her
father's a big-time lawyer.

86
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,708
And her brother's
studying to be one, too.

87
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,458
[HARUKI, TOWA]
Lawyers?

88
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,250
Yeah, so they're pretty strict.

89
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,583
Her family only lets her
stay out past curfew

90
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,333
if it's for school-related
events or activities.

91
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,458
[HARUKI]
That sounds rough.

92
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,041
[MIHARU]
Yeah.

93
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,291
[TOWA]
Now I get it.

94
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,416
[HARUKI] Mami does seem
pretty formal sometimes.

95
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
[TOWA]
That's true.

96
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,458
I'm fine with that,
but as for the family thing...

97
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,500
I didn't know.

98
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,625
Man, I'm so lame.

99
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:42,750
Damn it.

100
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,583
Oh, hi, Mami!

101
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,625
I didn't think you
were coming today.

102
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,041
[MAMI] I'm going to be taking
more classes for a while.

103
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,208
[FRIEND 8A] You study
more than anyone I know!

104
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:15,875
Towa?

105
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,458
Hey, do you have
a minute to talk?

106
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,625
[MAMI]
Uh... No. I can't.

107
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,333
Someone's coming to get me.

108
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,583
[MAMI]
Towa, my hand!

109
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,583
[TOWA]
Sorry.

110
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,708
[MAMI]
You surprised me.

111
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,875
I'm sorry about everything,
class rep.

112
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,708
Don't be.

113
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,125
I had no idea you'd
been pushing yourself so hard

114
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,625
this entire time.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,750
It's my fault for not
telling you about it sooner.

116
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,750
[TOWA] Is there anything
I can do to help?

117
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,000
That's so nice,

118
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,041
but I have to get
through this myself.

119
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,583
I've thought about it.

120
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,916
If by doing this
I can get my grades up,

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,458
my family might be less strict.

122
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,041
And then I might
actually get to have

123
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,958
a social life again.

124
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,291
Wow, class rep.

125
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,416
So then, this means
from now on,

126
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,541
you're even busier.

127
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah.

128
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,250
Okay, then.

129
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,250
Well, good luck.

130
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,333
[MAMI]
You mean that?

131
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,375
Yeah, if that's your
decision, okay.

132
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,041
I understand.

133
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,791
Just, will ya take it easy?

134
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,916
Remember, you still have a life.

135
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,000
[MAMI]
Thank you, Towa.

136
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,541
[TOWA]
Hey. I'm home.

137
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,791
Just in time.

138
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,750
I was worried I'd miss you.

139
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,125
But why?

140
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,125
You know you can
always email me.

141
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,500
I thought it'd be
better to talk in person.

142
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,291
[HARUKI]
What are you doing here?

143
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,833
[TOWA chuckles]
Came to tuck you in, bro.

144
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,708
[HARUKI]
You're such a cheeseball.

145
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,125
Did you eat yet?

146
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,625
[TOWA]
Yeah, I'm good.

147
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,041
Hey! Akira, you up?

148
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,083
[AKIRA]
Towa, the monster's coming!

149
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,500
Help!

150
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,458
[TOWA]
I got your back, kid.

151
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,750
I'll use my miracle
bomber on it.

152
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,125
[game music]

153
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,625
All right, Towa!

154
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:41,833
We killed it!

155
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,416
Hell yeah! Go me! Rock on!

156
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,583
Okay, let's do
the next quest now!

157
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,541
[HARUKI]
Soccer practice this early?

158
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,291
[TOWA]
It's voluntary.

159
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,833
I can't see the class rep, and
I don't feel like going home.

160
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,000
So, might as well do some laps.

161
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,416
[HARUKI]
Ah, so that's how it is.

162
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,583
Hey, man.
It's a big deal to me.

163
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,833
It's getting so nippy out there.

164
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,416
Maybe I should order
some extra steamed buns.

165
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,125
Nasa, how much longer, y'think?

166
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,041
[NASA] I'm pretty sure
we're almost there.

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
[TOWA]
Thanks, excuse me.

168
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,041
[MAMI]
Sorry, Towa!

169
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,583
I should've helped
you with those.

170
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,250
That's all right, I can manage.

171
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,541
Yeah, but you...

172
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,000
No, really.

173
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,041
At least let me do this.

174
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,500
Okay, thank you, then.

175
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,250
Really?

176
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,333
Towa delivered them
to the office?

177
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,375
[MAMI]
Uh-huh.

178
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,875
I'm so happy he remembered.

179
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:38,125
I've been completely swamped
with all this extra work lately.

180
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,333
He picked up the slack for you.

181
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,208
Like you traded places.
Sort of.

182
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,500
Hey, what do you mean by that?

183
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,583
[MIHARU] I mean,
I can't believe you forgot

184
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,583
your class rep duties.

185
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,916
You've been pushing
yourself too hard, Mami.

186
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,125
[TOWA sighs]

187
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,166
What are you doing?

188
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,916
I don't wanna go home, man.

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,291
Oh, no. Again?

190
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,291
[TOWA]
Shut up, dude.

191
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,208
I'm, like,
deeply troubled, okay?

192
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,458
[HARUKI]
That bad, huh?

193
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,375
Wanna come over?

194
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,625
Cool! Can I?

195
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,666
Come on,
before I change my mind.

196
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,791
[TOWA laughs]

197
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,666
Aw, you're the best, bro!
Thank you! [laughs]

198
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,791
[HARUKI]
Cut it out!

199
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,125
[AKI]
Uh, 'scuse me.

200
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,375
I hope I'm not interrupting.

201
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,375
Hey, Nozomi! I found them!

202
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,333
[NOZOMI gasps]
You did?

203
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,083
So awesome!

204
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,125
Uh, hey.

205
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,791
What's that you're wearing?

206
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,500
[NOZOMI laughs]

207
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,833
Are you guys free now?

208
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,708
I could use your help
with something.

209
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:43,875
[BOTH]
Huh?

210
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,000
Nicely done, Nozomi.

211
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,833
And I have you
to thank, as well.

212
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,291
Miharu's here?

213
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,375
[NOZOMI]
All right!

214
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,083
Let's start collecting
ginkgo nuts!

215
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,416
[HARUKI]
Are you kidding?

216
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,750
[TOWA] Ugh! How can you
stand doing this all day?

217
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,208
[NOZOMI]
Are you kidding?

218
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,458
We're the cooking society!
We live for stuff like this!

219
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,416
Nasa, look how many we found!

220
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,333
Wow, Nozomi! That's great.

221
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,583
Oh, my gosh!

222
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,625
Now we can make
some <i>chawanmushi</i> !

223
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,083
[NASA]
Good idea.

224
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,333
Hey, I could go for
some <i>chawanmushi</i> , too.

225
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,458
Oh, so now you're
all about this?

226
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,041
<i>Chawanmushi</i>
is super delicious.

227
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,041
Oh, I see one over there.

228
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,083
[HARUKI]
Where?

229
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,458
[MIHARU]
Right by the leaves.

230
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,166
You see it?

231
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,833
Oh, yeah! Good eye!

232
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,500
Okay, Haruki,
get in position, quickly.

233
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,541
[HARUKI]
Gotcha.

234
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,416
[HARUKI laughs]

235
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:00,875
[phone camera clicks]

236
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:01,916
[HARUKI]
What's up?

237
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,166
Oh, nothing.

238
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,958
Just noticing how
beautiful the leaves are.

239
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,458
I thought I'd take a few
pictures for the class rep.

240
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,208
You're not gonna send it?

241
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,625
Nah, I'll do it later.

242
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:22,250
I mean, she could be studying.
I don't want to bother her.

243
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,750
Right, good point.

244
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,166
Aw, Towa.

245
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,083
[TOWA sighs]

246
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,041
Oh, man. I really wish
she could be here.

247
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,833
[TOWA] Ugh, I reek
from gingko nut hunting.

248
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,708
[HARUKI] We'll clean up
when we get home.

249
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:42,875
[TOWA]
That was kinda fun.

250
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,791
[HARUKI]
Yeah.

251
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,333
[TOWA]
I still want <i>chawanmushi</i> !

252
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,750
[HARUKI]
You're gonna have to wait, bro.

253
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,083
[phone vibrates]

254
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,083
What's the matter?

255
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,833
[TOWA]
Sorry, Haruki.

256
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,041
I gotta go home.

257
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,625
[TOWA'S MOM]
Welcome back.

258
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,875
Oh, honey.
You're wearing your track suit?

259
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,500
[TOWA] I thought you were
gonna be working tonight.

260
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,750
Oh, I was able to
get my shift changed.

261
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,375
Now we'll have
more time to talk.

262
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,583
All right.

263
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,250
Then I'm go gonna take
a shower real quick.

264
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,666
[TOWA]
I understand how you feel.

265
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,583
I guess I'm just being
a little selfish.

266
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,958
Actually, your stepdad
is the one

267
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,375
who said it would be
better to live here

268
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,791
until you graduated.

269
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,333
You aren't selfish.

270
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,708
[TOWA]
Fine.

271
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,958
Then why are we
talking about this now?

272
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,500
Well, you know how
busy I've been lately.

273
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,125
So we just haven't seen
much of each other.

274
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,750
But next year, well,

275
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,958
we'll have to begin
discussing your future,

276
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,041
starting with entrance exams.

277
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,500
Your stepdad thought he'd
be able to help us with that.

278
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,708
And then, he also
said that he cou--

279
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,208
Blah, blah, "stepdad."

280
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,625
Do you always do everything
he tells you to do?!

281
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,208
I'm sorry, Mom.

282
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,541
That was wrong.

283
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,833
I shouldn't have said that.

284
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,500
It's freezing.

285
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,583
[MAMI]
Towa, wait!

286
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,000
Good morning.

287
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,208
Yeah, good morning, class rep.

288
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,083
Hey, um, yesterday--

289
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,666
[BOY STUDENT 8A]
Towa, you got a sec?

290
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,541
Hang on. I'll be right there.

291
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,625
I gotta go.

292
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:14,708
[MALE TEACHER 8A]
Hi, Mami.

293
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,500
Towa took the notebooks
to the office.

294
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,458
Oh, I see. Thank you.

295
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,708
[BOY STUDENT 8B]
Stand. Bow.

296
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,416
--[STUDENTS] Goodbye.
--[TEACHER 8A] Goodbye, class.

297
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,000
[BOY STUDENT 8C]
Hey, Towa,

298
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,125
how far did you get
in <i>Wild Monster</i> ?

299
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,000
I got up to the
dungeon in Area Ten.

300
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,833
[BOY STUDENT 8C] Aw, seriously?
How'd you do it?

301
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,166
I'm still stuck in the area
right before that one.

302
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,458
[TOWA]
Look it up, dude.

303
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:49,958
There's a strategy guide.

304
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,500
[BOY STUDENT 8C]
Yeah, I did that already.

305
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,166
It's not helping me at all.

306
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,875
[MAMI]
Um, Towa?

307
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,041
You're never up here this late.

308
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,416
What's up?

309
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,750
[MAMI]
I wanted to talk to you.

310
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,666
Did... Did something
happen yesterday?

311
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,666
[TOWA]
Yeah. It's fine, though.

312
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,291
I'm over it.

313
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,375
[MAMI]
But...

314
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,291
I swear, I'm sorry, I'm just
really busy right now.

315
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,833
You can't help it.

316
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,708
It's sorta like you're
working hard enough

317
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,583
for the both of us, right?

318
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,333
And your family's worried
because they think

319
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,625
I'm not good enough for you.

320
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,833
[MAMI]
Wait, but you're...

321
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,333
[TOWA]
It's fine, really.

322
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,458
And I mean like, you're
still willing to hang out

323
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,208
with me in spite of all that.

324
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,416
How noble of you.

325
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,833
Sorry I'm unreliable.

326
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:01,041
I promised that I'd
be supportive of you,

327
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,500
but now I'm just sulking.

328
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,416
I guess I'm just not as
rational of a person as you are.

329
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,958
Towa, wait, please listen...

330
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,958
[phone vibrates]

331
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,208
How long do you
expect me to wait?

332
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,708
Am I ever gonna be
first priority for you?

333
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,791
I don't know, Towa.

334
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,500
When are you
gonna live for yourself,

335
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,375
and not just for your parents?!

336
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,458
[MAMI]
All right, I see.

337
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,375
I guess maybe we
can't work things out.

338
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:51,416
[NARRATOR]
December, the season of couples.

339
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,000
Christmas songs
sweeten the chilly air.

340
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,500
Twinkling lights
reflect in their eyes.

341
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,208
His and her feelings,

342
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:01,166
slowly begin to thaw
their frozen hearts.

343
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,958
They pray for them to melt.

344
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,458
They hurt, and are hurt,

345
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:08,916
but they still want to see
each other no matter what.

346
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,583
Next time, on <i>Convenience Store</i>
<i>Boyfriends</i> , episode nine:

347
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:13,916
"December."

348
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,041
And this is the place
where their story begins.
