Sorry, I don't think
I can run in an election.

you were elected,

he could exit the position

When I was a first-year,

there was a legend going around.

If a boy and a girl crossed

been more sincere,

[MASAMUNE]
Ah, they're campaigning.

328
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,083
Hey. Mikado.

329
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,791
Well, this is a
sudden development.

[GIRL STUDENT 7B]
Attention, everyone:

331
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,750
The class one election speeches
are now ready to begin.

332
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,000
And here's our first candidate.

333
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,375
Fellow students.

334
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm Waka Kisaki, and I'm
running for vice president.

335
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,500
She's doing all of this for you.

336
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,041
What?

337
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,375
[WAKA] I intend to carry on
the current president's agenda,

338
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,333
and I will support the new
student council president

339
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,583
as I help...

340
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,750
Hey, Mikado, isn't this great?
Check it out!

341
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,500
Everybody got an
e-mail late last night.

342
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,416
I hope you decide
to vote for her.

343
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,750
Hey, Haruki, c'mon!

344
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,708
Quit slacking off!

345
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,083
Gotta go. Sorry.

346
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,958
Vote for Waka.

Hey.

[STUDENTS chattering]

350
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:04,791
Good morning.

[NARRATOR] November, when
a carpet of ginkgo leaves

353
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,958
covers the ground with
the color of the sun.

354
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,500
The footsteps of winter
quietly approach.

355
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:59,375
As they move closer,
hearts move apart.

356
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:02,208
One-word messages
float back and forth.

357
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,416
He wants to see her, but can't.

358
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,000
He hurt her. His heart hurts.

359
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,833
He can't even say he's sorry.

00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,958

where their story begins.
