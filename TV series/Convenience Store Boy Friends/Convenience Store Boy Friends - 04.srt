1
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,208
Hey, where do you want me
to take this thing, Haruki?

2
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:22,500
Uh... I think over to the
third-years' head teacher.

3
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,250
You got it, dude.

4
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,666
Right, guys.

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,500
When you're finished,
then start on the next project.

6
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:28,625
Keep me posted.

7
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,875
Okay, Mikado,
I'm all done with this.

8
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,416
Good job, Nozomi. Thank you.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,583
No problem at all.

10
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,750
Just keep the work
coming to me. I love it.

11
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,666
Well, take these, then.

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,750
Sure, you bet!

13
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,166
Well you seem
to be having fun.

14
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,083
[NOZOMI]
How could I not?

15
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,541
Now everyone gets a chance
to try Nasa's amazing food.

16
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,000
He's making it?

17
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:54,083
Hey, Mikado,
you're okay with it, right?

18
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,750
Of course, it'll be
a huge help to us all.

19
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:57,958
[NOZOMI giggles]

20
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,666
I would do anything
for the cooking society!

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,875
Woo!

22
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,583
Wow, what's with her?

23
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:04,833
High on life.

24
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,541
[STUDENT 4A]
Wow, Towa.

25
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,875
You're in every event.

26
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,250
[TOWA]
You know it.

27
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,250
Attention whore.

28
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,666
[TOWA] Come on!
They asked me to.

29
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,083
What that really makes
me is dependable.

30
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,166
Right, you're an
attention whore.

31
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,291
Hey, wait.

32
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,791
You misunderstand
what I'm trying to--

33
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,416
Hang on, we haven't
chosen anyone

34
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,875
for the three-legged race.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,416
Would any of you
students like to volunteer?

36
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Why don't you do it?

37
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,791
Dude please, no.

38
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,750
You'd have to pay me first.

39
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,541
Listen up, guys are allowed
to run with girls, okay?

40
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,750
[STUDENT 4D]
You serious?

41
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,250
[STUDENT 4B]
That's even more embarrassing.

42
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,583
[STUDENT 4A laughs]

43
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,833
Well, fine.
Then I'm gonna do it.

44
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,583
What? You, Towa?

45
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,250
[TOWA]
Let's see.

46
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,708
Class rep, are you entered
in any events yet?

47
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,791
It looks like a no.

48
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:54,916
You in?

49
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,416
[HARUKI]
Really?

50
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,291
You two are gonna
do that race together?

51
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,916
[TOWA]
Yep, it kinda just happened.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,416
Maybe it was destiny.

53
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,416
Am I right or what, class rep?

54
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,583
Um, sorry, but--

55
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,750
She doesn't seem very into it.

56
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:14,833
[TOWA]
What?

57
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,166
What the heck
are you talking about?

58
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,458
That's not true, right?

59
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,541
Are you, or aren't you?

60
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,500
I can't do it.

61
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,750
I'm not even remotely athletic.

62
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,166
Don't worry about that!

63
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,500
Your partner will help.

64
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,375
[TOWA chuckles]

65
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,791
[MAMI]
That's even worse.

66
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,750
[TOWA]
Come again?

67
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,333
It's impossible.

68
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,125
I just know I'm going
to trip and fall down.

69
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,291
It's not fair to a real athlete

70
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,500
to get stuck with
a klutz like me.

71
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,875
Come on, class rep.

72
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,833
[HARUKI] Well, then Towa's
the perfect partner for you!

73
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,416
Huh? What do you mean?

74
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,083
When you're with someone good,
they can help pull you through.

75
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,583
Your time will improve.

76
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,500
Oh, yeah,
I didn't even think of that.

77
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,583
He's got a point.

78
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,375
Whaddya think, Mami?

79
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,541
Oh, I don't know.

80
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,666
[TOWA]
I'll train with you!

81
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,041
[MAMI]
Huh?

82
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,958
You'll train with us
also, Haruki.

83
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,416
[HARUKI]
Me? Why?

84
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,625
[TOWA]
Thanks, buddy.

85
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,958
Wait a second.
Where can we possibly train?

86
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,458
We can't do it at school.

87
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,750
[MIKI]
Then, I can recommend a place.

88
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,541
[HARUKI]
Oh.

89
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,458
[HARUKI]
He was right.

90
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,875
There's nobody else here.

91
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,666
[MAMI]
What?

92
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,750
You, uh...

93
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,416
You look good
in your track suit.

94
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,708
Please don't say that,
it's so embarrassing.

95
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,500
Aw, but how come?
It's the truth.

96
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,833
Just don't do it!

97
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,291
A three-legged race...

98
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,208
I mean, it's so humiliating.

99
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,541
I'll never get through it.

100
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,000
[HARUKI]
Towa, quit screwing around.

101
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,166
Let's get started.
We're wasting time here.

102
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,791
Yeah, man,
I couldn't agree more.

103
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,375
So what kind of training are
you gonna torture me with?

104
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,416
[TOWA]
Here.

105
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,208
[MAMI]
All of this?!

106
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,000
Wow, that's pretty intense.

107
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,750
I can't. Don't make me.

108
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,291
[TOWA]
Of course you can, silly.

109
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,958
We'll start slowly at
your pace, nice and easy.

110
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,500
Well, worrying about it
won't get you anywhere,

111
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,583
so how 'bout we go
for a run now? C'mon.

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,625
No, wait! Stop.

113
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,250
Well, it's only your first day.

114
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,083
Hang on. Miharu?

115
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,166
Hey! [laughs]

116
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,250
Wow, I needed that!

117
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,875
Thanks so much!

118
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,041
[MIHARU] Oh, it was the least
I could to help you guys out

119
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,458
in some way.

120
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,416
Miharu, do you know what
events you're participating in?

121
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,750
None, actually.

122
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,958
I'm not supposed to do
strenuous activities.

123
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,250
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.

124
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,541
Besides, even though
I can't run with everybody,

125
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,125
I can still cheer you on.

126
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,291
When is our class
practicing tomorrow?

127
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,500
Oh, it'll be during
our study period.

128
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,875
[TOWA]
Prep committee reporting!

129
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,625
[MIHARU]
Thanks, glad you made it.

130
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,666
[MIHARU] Here, do you
mind taking these?

131
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,833
Happy to.

132
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,291
Seems like your club's
been really busy.

133
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,541
[MIHARU giggles]

134
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,125
Nah. You're much busier.

135
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,625
That's definitely not true.

136
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,416
You're working just
as hard as us.

137
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,541
Yes, I guess so.

138
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,000
[MIHARU]
But still...

139
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,958
I wish I could participate
a bit more.

140
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,958
Then you should participate
in any way you can.

141
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,833
I'd love to.

142
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,333
But how?

143
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,125
Well, let me think. Maybe...

144
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,833
What's that pink thing
hanging off your bag?

145
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,833
[MIHARU]
What thing? Oh. This charm?

146
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,291
[TOWA] Yeah, why don't you
make stuff like that?

147
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,041
As a matter of fact,
he would love one.

148
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,291
Wait a minute. I didn't ask...

149
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,500
But just think about it, bro!

150
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,166
You know you want
your own lucky charm.

151
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,208
It'll inspire you!

152
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,166
Well, yeah,
of course I do, but...

153
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,625
I mean, I can't be the only one.

154
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,375
[MIHARU]
Is that true? Really?

155
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,750
For sure!

156
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:31,416
What I mean is, ya think
other people would want 'em?

157
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,666
I know they would.

158
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,791
Without a doubt!

159
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,250
They're personal motivators!

160
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,791
[MIHARU]
Then I'll make them!

161
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,541
For the whole class,
in time for the festival.

162
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,416

00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,666
[MIHARU]
Yeah, I'm fine.

327
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,000
I have an idea!

328
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,958
You wanna help us out
for a little while?

329
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,000
Me?

330
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,125
[NOZOMI]
Welcome, everyone!

331
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,958
Who wants a delicious
gourmet lunch?

332
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,375
I'll take two.

333
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,500
Here you go.

334
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:10,833
Thanks, enjoy!

335
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,875
Come and get 'em, everyone!
They're going fast!

336
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,458
[MIKADO] The afternoon events
are starting soon.

337
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,041
[MASAMUNE]
This food is amazing.

338
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,166
[MIKADO] You'll be so full.
Good luck trying to run.

339
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,250
[MASAMUNE]
Done. Time to head over.

340
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,791
[STUDENT 4E] The grade-based
relay is starting.

341
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,375
[STUDENT 4F] Yeah, the student
council president

342
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,708
versus Masamune.

343
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,458
[MAMI]
I'm so nervous.

344
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,625
You're gonna do really great.

345
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,000
You trained super hard.

346
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,000
Just have a little faith.

347
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,916
Do you mean in you?

348
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,041
No, I mean, in yourself, 'kay?

349
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,458
[TOWA] And look,
Miharu's cheering you on.

350
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,166
[MAMI]
You're right, I'm ready.

351
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,541
All right, Towa!

352
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,750
Get 'em, bud!

353
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,750
Go, Mami!

[CLASS 3 4C]
Class rep!

359
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,166
Way to go, you were awesome!

360
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,750
Nicely done, class rep!

361
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,916
[CLASS 3 4E]
Class rep, you're my hero!

362
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,125
Thank you so much.

363
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,291
Ha, I told ya!

364
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,416
You rocked it! See?

365
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,583
[chuckles]

366
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,625
I'm glad we did this.

367
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,583
[STUDENT 4G]
Bye, you guys.

368
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,666
[STUDENT 4B]
Bye!

[GIRLS giggle]

370
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,833
Hey, you two! [laughs]

371
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:07,875
Hi, Miharu.

372
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,958
Go on, take a break, Haruki.

373
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,291
I got this, okay?

374
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,333
[MIHARU]
Sorry about that.

375
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,125
I know you still had
more to clean up.

376
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,250
[HARUKI] No big deal,
we were almost finished.

377
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,666
Besides, Towa said he'd
handle the rest of it anyway.

378
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,791
[MIHARU]
Well, good.

379
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:30,208
Hey, uh, thanks again
for the charm. It's cool.

380
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,500
I'm the one who
should be thanking you.

381
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,166
[HARUKI]
Huh?

382
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,458
Well...

383
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,791
For most of my life,
I've barely been involved

384
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,833
in any sports festivals.

385
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:43,666
I figured it was a lost cause,
and sort of gave up on it.

386
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,708
But you helped create
a unique opportunity

387
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:49,000
for me to join in,
so for the first time in years,

388
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,291
I finally got to participate.

389
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,750
Happy I could help.

390
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,083
Rain out of nowhere?

391
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,375
[HARUKI]
Come on, this way.

392
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,333
[HARUKI] We might be
stuck here for a while.

393
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,250
Is something wrong?

394
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,125
Nothing. I'll be fine.

395
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,916
[HARUKI]
Put this on.

396
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,500
Oh, thank you.

[NARRATOR] August,
when the sun is scorching hot,

398
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,250
and the air is heavy.

399
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:57,500
Her straw hat rippled by the
wind raises his temperature.

400
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:01,083
The chirping of cicadas
excites her uncertain heart.

401
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,583
On nights when giant
flowers blossom,

402
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,416
their hearts cross paths,

403
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,750
and the friction raises their
temperatures even higher.

404
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:12,333

<i>Boyfriends</i> episode five:
