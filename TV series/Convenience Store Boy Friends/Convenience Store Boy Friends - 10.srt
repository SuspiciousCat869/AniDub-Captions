[TOWA]
You looking at that again?

2
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,166
Yeah, I guess.

3
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:23,125
Man, that was a fun
New Year's Day.

4
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:27,916
[TOWA]
Check this out!

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,500
Awesome, am I right?

6
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,291
I'll hang onto this picture for
the rest of my life, for real.

7
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,166
You said that
like a million times.

8
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,666
[TOWA] Well, you two should've
taken one together.

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,541
Whatever, it's fine.

10
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,708
You're such a candy ass.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,291
I wouldn't want to
bother her with it.

12
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,958
What? I thought you two
were doing just fine.

13
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,750
[HARUKI] She was just being
nice, it doesn't mean anything.

14
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,166
[TOWA]
Just being nice?

15
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,625
[chuckles] Seriously, bro?

16
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,916
I think it means something.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,916
Oh, yeah? Like what?

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,208
I mean, the two of you

Oh.

It's the class rep.
'Kay, I'm outta here.

22

See you at school tomorrow.

I take it everything's okay?

24
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,875
Yeah, man.

[door closes]

26
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,166
[TOWA] Oh! It's so
frickin' cold out here!

27
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,041
Man, I hate winter so much.
I wish spring would hurry up!

28
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,916
[HARUKI] Looks like things are
already warming up for you.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,500
Hey, do you have practice now?

30
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,833
Hey, class rep!

31
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,541
Yeah, but I think
I'm gonna bail on it.

32
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,583
I can't deal with
going outside again!

33
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,041
Pull yourself together.

34
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,291
But it's so chilly.
I'll freeze to death!

35
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,333
You're unbelievable.

36
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,958
What am I gonna
do with you, huh?

37
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,541
[TOWA]
What? I can have it?

38
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,208
Yes, you can. I have two.

39
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:37,041
Oh, wow! Awesome! Thank you!

40
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,666
Work hard, okay?

41
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,000
How can I not when you
gave me this gift?

42
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,166
Idiot. Put it away. Stop.

43
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,500
[HARUKI]
Well, I better get goin'.

44
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,250
Kick ass at practice, bro!

[SWIM TEAM DUDE 10A]
Wait, captain,

00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,875
don't you have entrance exams?

50
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,291
I gotta light a fire
under your asses.

51
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,083
You have a big meet coming up.

52
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,041
Good luck, Mishima.

53

[HARUKI]
Uh...

54
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,958
I've got my eye on you.

55
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,958
Thanks, captain.
What about us?

56
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,083
What about you?

57
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,041
Just ask your girlfriend
to wish ya luck.

58
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,791
Wha...? How'd you know that?

59
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,541
I didn't even know!
A girlfriend, seriously?

60

No, just a friend.

00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,875
But if...

62
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:23,333
If your crush wishes you luck,
wouldn't that motivate you more?

[MIHARU]
Good luck.

I think I'm heading out soon.

What about you?

68
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,916
[MAMI] I'm going to stay
a little while longer.

Uh?

70

You meeting him later?

[MAMI]
Yeah.

72
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,208
You are so lucky.

73
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,750
[MAMI]
I wouldn't say that.

74

He whines if I
leave without him.

a swim meet coming up soon.

Uh? He does, really?

He didn't tell you?

Uh-uh.

79
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,666
That's out of character.

80
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,708
I would've assumed you'd be
the first person he told.

81
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,791
Unreal. I can't believe it.

82
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,791
And after you gave him
that beautiful scarf

for Christmas, too.

a lot lately.

I know. Mami told me.

She did? Really?

get to be a starter yet, though.

00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,208
I'm really worried.

165
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,666
Me, too.

166
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,083
Then, Haruki, why don't you--?

167
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,708
No, wait I...

168
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,833
I think I should call her.

169
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,208
Maybe it's better if
she hears from me first.

170
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,791
Right, good idea.

171
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,958
Tell her Haruki's worried about
her and wants her to call him.

172
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,708
That way you can't keep
skipping out on it.

173
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,833
I-I, uh, okay.

174
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,458
Regardless, I'll let her
know you asked about her.

175
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,625
After all, it's
the truth, isn't it?

176
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,416
Yeah, thanks.

177
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,583
[HARUKI sighs]

178
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,958
[phone buzzes]

179
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,625
Uh, hey Mom?

180
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,083
[TOWA'S MOM]
Hm?

181
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,875
Do you have a patient,
last name, Mashiki,

182
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,166
first name Miharu?

183
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,041
You know that's confidential.

184
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, right. I forgot.

185
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,041
Stew's awesome, by the way.

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,833
She a friend?

187
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,208
[TOWA]
It's been a week, now.

188
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,750
I was thinking I'd try to
visit her at home maybe.

189
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:09,208
She told me she was fine,
but I'm still pretty worried.

190
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,208
Hey. You all right?

191
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,875
Class rep, listen.

192
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,958
[MAMI] Wait, you saw
Miharu at the hospital?

193
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,458
Do you think I should
tell Haruki about it?

194
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,916
Maybe, but we don't
know if there's anything

195
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,958
seriously wrong with her, right?

196
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,333
Well, no, we don't, but still.

197
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,708
[MIHARU gasps]

198
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,083
Oh, hello there.
Are you meeting someone?

199
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,875
[HARUKI]
Huh? Uh, no, I'm not.

200
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,541
Hi. How can I help you?

201
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,958
[sighs]

202
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,541
[knocking]

203
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,541
Food?

204
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,375
[HARUKI]
I feel really strange lately.

205
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,333
It's as if I'm not
even myself anymore.

206
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,708
I don't know exactly
how to describe it,

207
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:04,208
but when I'm swimming,
I can't seem to focus at all.

208
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:09,208
Hell, I almost can't even feel
the water, y'know what I mean?

209
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,208
Maybe you're just in a slump.

210
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,583
Crap, I don't know.

211
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,625
[TOWA]
That's happened to me before.

212
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:20,000
I was too distracted by
other things to focus.

213
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,500
Yeah, so you get it.

214
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,708
Please don't make fun of me
when I tell you this, okay?

215
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,083
[TOWA]
Not even a little bit?

216
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,958
[HARUKI] It's Miharu.
I'm worried about her.

217
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,083
[TOWA]
We all are, bro.

218
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,666
[HARUKI]
Yeah.

219
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:48,000
I know, but, it's not just that
she's sick; there's more to it.

220
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,416
Since before she
started missing class.

221
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,625
Maybe forever ago.

222
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,375
I'm not sure what
the thing is exactly.

223
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,125
Miharu herself hasn't
changed at all.

224
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:02,416
But there's still something
that's different about her.

225
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,041
I'm not making any sense.

226
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:11,875
It just sounds weird
when I say it, man.

227
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,500
[sighs]

228
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,750
What's wrong with me?

229
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,500
I'll tell you.
You're invested now.

230
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,708
What do you mean?

231
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,500
[TOWA] If Miharu had
given me that scarf,

232
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,250
then it would just be a scarf.

233
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:29,291
But, if it was from the class
rep, it'd be priceless.

234
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:34,125
It's the same way
this is for me.

235
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:40,541
In fact, I'll prob'ly
keep it forever.

236
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,541
It's just the way it goes.

237
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,791
I know.

238
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,375
But, see, this is different.

239
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,541
Miharu doesn't--

240
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,541
Is that what she
actually told you?

241
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,250
Uh...

242
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,916
[TOWA] Then it's possible she
feels the same way you do, man.

243
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,583
And since you're too damn
chicken to say anything at all,

244
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,291
I bet Miharu just thinks that
you only see her as a friend.

245
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,833
What?! That's not true.
You know I like her.

246
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,333
[TOWA]
Hold up. Stop it.

247
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,833
Why are you whining
to me about it?

248
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,041
[gasps]

249
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,208
[TOWA] Maybe its finally time
for you to make things clear.

250
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,041
Or it could all end
before you're able

251
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,041
to tell her the truth.

252
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,583
[HARUKI]
Yeah.

253
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,750
Your test results should
be ready next week.

254
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,750
Can I go back to school again?

255
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,125
Of course you can.

256
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,625
Hey!

257
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:50,125
As long as we're out, is there
somewhere you'd like to go?

258
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,291
[MIHARU chuckles]

259
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,916
[MIHARU]
Haruki!

260
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,125
Huh?

261
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,916
I had a hunch that
I'd find you here.

262
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,625
Are you finally feeling better?

263
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,000
[MIHARU] Yeah, sorry
I made you guys worry.

264
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,333
That's all right.

265
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,458
It's so nice to be
back at this place.

266
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,458
I just feel so
comfortable in here.

267
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,416
[HARUKI]
In the convenience store?

268
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,375
[MIHARU]
Mm-hm.

269
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,458
This may sound a little silly,

270
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,083
but I daydream about
it all the time.

271
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,458
You daydream?

272
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,041
Yeah.

273
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,791
[MIHARU] I know it's only your
basic, average store.

274
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,750
It's not like there's anything
special about it.

275
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,500
But I just imagine so many
interesting stories

276
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,666
happeing in that place.

277
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,833
[MIHARU] That's what I
like to think, anyway.

278
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,041
[MIHARU]
But, you see,

279
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,166
it makes everything seem
so bright and happy.

280
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,750
Like the whole world is a gift

281
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,625
and nothing could ever
go wrong, you know?

282
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,375
Is that why you love books?

283
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,708
Uh-huh!

284
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,666
And it's also the reason

285
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,458
that convenience store is
such a special place for me.

286
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,250
[MIHARU]
I wonder whether this is what

287
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:11,208
standing next to the person
you truly love feels like.

288
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,625
[MIHARU] I can only see him
at the convenience store.

289
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:24,333
Nobody knows about my
very own secret boyfriend.

290
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,708
My convenience store boyfriend.

291
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:30,541
For a little while,
I let myself daydream.

292
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:36,416
I guess that's all it
was meant to be, but...

293
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,375
...then I thought, maybe
I'm being punished for this.

294
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,416
Punished for choosing
you to be my boyfriend,

295
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,083
but...

296
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,250
[MIHARU]
I was so surprised.

297
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:06,708
Normally my daydreams
end as just that. Daydreams.

298
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:11,208
But, sometimes they turn
into something else.

299
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:16,291
Way back then, I was
totally nervous and shy.

300
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,208
Then you showed up.

301
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,500
And, you jumped straight
out of my daydream.

302
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,750
It's like...

303
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,875
It's like you're my...

304
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,333
...my actual boyfriend.

305
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,541
[MIHARU]
That's weird, right?

306
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,166
No, not weird at all.

307
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,916
[MIHARU sneezes]

308
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,708
Should we wander back now?

309
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,708
Miharu, wait!

310
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,291
[MIHARU]
Hm?

311
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,541
Can we stay a bit longer?

312
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,750
Do you mind?

313
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,166
That okay?

314
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,625
[MIHARU]
Mm-hm.

315
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,666
Hey, listen.

316
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,125
I, uh...

317
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,583
Actually...

318
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,291
Look there!

319
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:38,291
This place is so
incredible, isn't it?

320
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,541
Right here.

321
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,083
Yeah.

322
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,166
[HARUKI]
Um, Miharu?

323
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,083
[MIHARU]
Yeah?

324
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,625
--So, I--
--[MIHARU] Wait.

325
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,291
Please, wait.

326
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,250
I have to say it.

327
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,291
[HARUKI] So, not being able to
see you for those few days

328
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:04,291
was actually really hard for me.

329
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,500
Without even trying,
I think about you.

330
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,791
You just come to mind.

331
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,958
Always you.

332
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,958
I didn't know why.
I couldn't figure it out,

333
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:19,083
so I kept going over it--
again, and again.

334
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,250
And then I answered
my own question.

335
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,833
[MIHARU grunts]

336
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,000
I understood it.

337
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,541
Miharu, I uh...

338
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,416
Miharu?

339
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,416
Miharu!

340
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:51,833
[NARRATOR] February, when
winter hints at its departure.

341
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,291
The warmth of that
fateful day they shared.

342
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:57,291
The clouds in the sky.
The red sunset.

343
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,708
Her hair in the wind.

344
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:01,666
The picture book held
carefully in both hands.

345
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,708
Those fragments of memory of
that innocent young girl

346
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,500
have now become distant.

347
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,791
Too far away to reach.

348
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,041
Next time, on <i>Convenience</i>
<i>Store Boy Friends.</i>

349
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:13,125
Episode eleven: "February."

350
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,958
And this is the place
where their story begins.
