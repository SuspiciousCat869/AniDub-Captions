Knock it off.

[TOWA]
I know, totally!

[MAMI]
Oh, really, it has?

Sorry. Time really flies

Class rep!

I've been looking
all over for you!

40
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,916
What are you doing?

41
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,291
Are you free after this?

42
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,791
[MAMI]
No, of course not!

43
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,583
[TOWA] What do you mean,
"of course not"?

44
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,041
Be quiet!
You're gonna get us in trouble.

45
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,291
Uh...

46
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,583
So, anyway...

47
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,250
[MAMI]
What do you want?

48
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,291
Sorry?

49
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,916
[TOWA]
What's going on with you?

50
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,458
We have to prep for
the Aozora Festival.

51
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,875
I thought we could talk about it
while we walk home together.

52
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,625
Uh, well, guess I
should get going now.

53
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:24,458
[MAMI]
No, wait!

54
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,291
Uh, I can't, Towa.

55
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,916
I promised I'd hang out
with Miharu after this.

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,791
[MIHARU]
You did?

57
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:30,833
[MAMI]
C'mon.

58
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,916
Class rep! Hey, wait
a sec! Come back!

59
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,791
[MIHARU] Mami, why did you
lie to Towa like that?

60
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,000
I think I know.

61
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,541
Did something happen
between you two

62
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,833
at the fireworks show?

63
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,541
[MIHARU]
Whoa! It did!

64
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,000
[MAMI]
Oh, no, Miharu!

65
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,916
It's um, uh...

66
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,708
You um, you just, kinda caught
me off guard, I guess.

67
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,500
But what do you mean?

68
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, maybe...

69
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,250
Maybe I made a weird
face or something.

70
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,375
I'm not really good
at these kinds of things.

71
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,500
I don't know.

72
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,083
[MIHARU]
It's okay.

73
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,000
I think it's a good thing.

74
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,250
It is? You promise?

75
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,333
As a matter of fact, it's great!

76
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,875
Wow, okay.

77
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,416
You're a good friend, Miharu.

78
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,250
And what about you?

79
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,166
[MAMI] Is there anyone
you're interested in?

80
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,083
I dunno. I, umm...

81
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,833
[MIHARU]
I'm not sure.

82
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:07,666
Really?

83
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,083
Well... I have to go.

84
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,916
Oh. Study hard at cram school.

89
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,625
[SAKAMOTO]
Actually, it's almost fall.

90
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,250
No, silly.
What I'm talking about is

91
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,916
the spring of their youth.

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,916
[SAKAMOTO] Please, get your
head out of the clouds.

93
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,041
So you already knew about them?

94
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,416
[HARUKI]
Uh, yeah.

95
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,541
[MIHARU]
I was kinda surprised.

96
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,125
I was too at first, but it
does seem to be working out.

97
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,208
You're right. I see it.

98
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,750
[MIHARU]
Haruki?

99
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:30,791
[HARUKI]
Yeah?

100
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:42,416
[MIHARU] What's it like to be
interested in someone?

101
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,583
[HARUKI]
Huh?

102
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:44,666
Wait, so...

103
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,333
What do you mean?

104
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:50,083
Well, I just mean,
um, exactly what I said.

105
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,208
Mami and Towa.

106
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,416
You know,
that kind of interested.

107
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,125
[HARUKI]
What?

108
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,458
[MIHARU]
What I mean is...

109
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,875
Is there anyone
you're interested in?

110
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,125
[HARUKI]
Interested in?

111
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,500
I dunno, I uh...

112
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,208
Why would you ask me?

113
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,541
[TOWA]
What are you, an idiot?

114
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,875
[HARUKI grunts]

115
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,041
You were alone together
in the park after school,

116
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,291
and she asked if you're
interested in anyone?

117
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,541
You just blew a
perfect opportunity!

118
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,291
I didn't know what to say!

119
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,666
Listen to me, bud.

120
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,333
Dudes from other schools
will be coming

121
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,125
to the cultural festival.

122
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,125
The girl you like could
find herself another guy.

123
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,500
[HARUKI]
But that'd be...

124
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah, that'd be bad.

125
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,666
Oh, shut up! Why don't you
mind your own business?

126
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,791
Just worry about
your own love life!

127
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,375
Huh? What's wrong?

128
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,708
[TOWA]
She shot me down again.

129

--Again?
--[door opens]

130

Hey, Towa,

131
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,625
my mom wants to know
what your plans are for tonight.

132
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,458
Well, I was gonna go back home,

133
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,875
but I'll stay here instead.

134
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,125
I think you should go home!

135
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,125
Dude, c'mon!
Don't be like that!

136
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,875
Aww, let me stay, I'm depressed!

137
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:02,958
Too bad!

138
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,166
So, you staying or what?

139
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,041
[TOWA]
Yes, I am!

140
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:05,916
[HARUKI]
The hell you are!

141
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,791
[TOWA]
I said I'm staying!

142
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:07,708
[HARUKI]
Go home!

143
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:08,708
[TOWA]
Suck it!

144
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,916
[HARUKI]
Get out and go home, dude!

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,916
[AKIRA]
When you morons figure it out,

146
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,166
Mom wants you to clean
up before dinner!

147
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,250
[HARUKI]
Leave!

148
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,541
[MIKI]
Welcome. Come in.

149
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,625
[MIKI] I'm sorry,
these are all we have left.

150
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,375
That's fine. I appreciate it.

151
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,375
[MIKI] They're in
high demand every year.

152
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,375
What's your class
doing for the festival?

153
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,916
A haunted house, in fact.

154
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,250
[MIKI]
Ooh!

155
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,958
So you'll be stacking
desks to form your walls,

156
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,916
and the boxes are for
making gravestones, right?

157
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,166
That's right.

158
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,083
[SAKAMOTO] I think the
drugstore by the station

159
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,416
has some cardboard
boxes they'd give you.

160
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,958

So instead of the Seven Dwarves,

up with the idea.

00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,625
He knows he'll never give up,
no matter what.

323
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,333
Water is an amazing entity.

324
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,541
First it's heavy, but if you
keep pushing through,

325
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,291
your body and heart
feel lighter.

326
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,000
I love swimming.

327
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,541
The water feels great,
and finding that book

328
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,125
in kindergarten honestly
changed my life.

329
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,166
--Miharu.
--Yeah?

330
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,791
[HARUKI] You went to Wakaba
Kindergarten, also, right?

331
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,791
You did, too?

332
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:15,958
Bye-bye.

333
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:22,750
[HARUKI]
That book...

334
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,208
It didn't belong
to me originally.

335
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,333
There was a girl
who read it to me,

336
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,958
and then she let me have it.

337
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:42,041
Since then,
it's stayed in my mind.

338
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:45,166
Because of that,
she's always been special to me.

339
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,833
Miharu, are you possibly...?

340
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:55,833
You okay?

341
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,250
[NARRATOR]
October.

342
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,791
When small changes
begin to appear

343
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,708
amidst the falling leaves.

344
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:57,041
They assumed
nothing would change.

345
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,291
There was no way it could.

346
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,958
The other story of him and her.

347
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,416
There's a painful,
important, and precious line

348
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,916
that they simply
cannot cross, but must.

349
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,208
Next time on <i>Convenience Store</i>
<i>Boyfriends.</i> episode seven:

350
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:13,541
"October."

351
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,750
And this is the place
where their story begins.
