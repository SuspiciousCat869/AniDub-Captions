Stop talking crazy.
Here, put this up.

All right, Christmas!

Thank you!

Glad this is warm.

Right? It's cold out.

26
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,458
Yeah.

27
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,250
[MIHARU] Are things not working
out between Mami and Towa?

28
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:42,250
They both seem so unhappy.

[HARUKI]
Who knows?

30
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,291
It looked like it was going
great before, but now...

31
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,125
I'd hate to see them
just drift apart.

32
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,291
After all this time.

33
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,666
Yeah, I really hope they
can patch everything up.

34
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,541
[MIHARU]
Is there anything we can do?

35
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,333
[HARUKI]
Whaddya mean?

36
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,083
I mean, to help Mami and Towa.

37
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,625
But what can we do?

38
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,541
Let me think...

39
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,791
Uh?

40
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,708

[ANNOUNCER 9A] Twenty
minutes into the second half,

44
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,250
they've managed to
tie up the score.

45
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,000
He's dribbling down the pitch,

46
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,541
looking for an
opening somewhere.

47
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:58,291
But the defense is tight, and
now he's trapped at centerfield.

[HARUKI]
Hey, you got a second?

55
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,375
[TOWA]
I guess.

56
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:21,833
[HARUKI]
I, uh, well, actually...

57
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:22,916
[TOWA]
Spit it out.

58
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,833
[HARUKI]
Uh, are you free on the 24th?

59
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,291
The night of the
closing ceremony?

60
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,625
[TOWA] Christmas Eve?
Are you desperate dude?

61
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,000
Why're you asking
me out on a date?

62
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,541
[HARUKI] I'm not, you idiot.
It was Miharu's idea.

63
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,250
[TOWA] So you're asking me to go
on a date with you and Miharu?

64
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,291
That's even weirder, bro.

65
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,916
[HARUKI]
Don't be so dense.

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,250
No, we thought we'd
throw a little party.

67
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,083
[TOWA]
A Christmas party. Great.

68
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,916
[HARUKI] She said she
wanted you to come, too.

69
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,000
[TOWA sighs]

70
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,083
[TOWA] You invited the
class rep, didn't you?

71
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,375
[HARUKI]
What?

72
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,958
[TOWA chuckles]
I get it now.

73
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,333
[HARUKI]
Come on, Towa!

74
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,500
[TOWA]
She won't show up.

75
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,083
[HARUKI]
What?

76
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,875
[TOWA] I think she's been
avoiding me at school lately.

77
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,041
I haven't been able
to talk to her.

78
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,250
[TOWA] Plus, her family's got
her on a short leash.

79
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:27,333
[HARUKI] Anyway, Miharu said
she'd try to invite her, but--

80
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,583
You there?

81
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,333
Sorry, I already have
other plans that night.

82
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,208
[HARUKI]
What, really?

83
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,416
Yeah, really. I got some
family stuff to deal with.

84
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,916
[HARUKI]
Oh.

85
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:42,166
I guess that'll make it tough.

86
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,250
You can't even come
for a little while?

88

Dude, I'm scared.

00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,375
Huh?

91
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,458
About the class rep.
I'm scared to talk to her.

92
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,916
[HARUKI]
Why?

93
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,458
[gasps]

94
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,750
Never mind. It's nothing.

95
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,250
I'll try to head over there
once I'm done with dinner.

Oh, okay!

[TOWA] I have no idea
when that'll be, though.

Wait! What now?!

00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:13,916

Later.

Of course I'm scared.

102
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,875
It might be over between us.

103
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,291
All done!

00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,166

while you're on vacation,
I want you to bear in mind

110
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,125
exam students in
particular should

111
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,083
still take care of themselves,

112
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,375
and study harder than
ever as they enter

113
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,958
the final sprint towards the
end of the school year.

Thanks for having me.

Please, make yourself at home.

125

[HARUKI]
Uh. Okay.

00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,625
Goodbye, sweetheart.

Bye, Mom. I'll see
you guys later.

going out for the night.

129

[HARUKI]
Oh, really?

130
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,625
[MIHARU]
Yeah.

131
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,500
I've never had my friends
over for a party before,

132
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,000
so I think they were just
trying to be considerate.

133
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,375
It's nice to see you.

134
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,250
[HARUKI]
Mami! You made it.

135
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:50,000
I couldn't tell my parents
until the last second. Sorry.

136
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,208
It's okay. I'm really
glad you're here.

137
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,750
You said you have about another
hour to hang out, right?

138
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:55,833
Only an hour?

139
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,958
[MAMI]
Yeah. I have a strict curfew.

140
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,916
But, Towa... You think
he'll make it?

141
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,208
I'm not sure he can.

142
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,875
[MIHARU] Well, let's get
the party started.

143
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,916
Could you guys maybe help
me bring all the things out?

144

[MAMI]
Okay.

145
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh, yeah!

146
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,166
[TOWA'S MOM]
Were you nervous?

147
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,791
Huh? Oh, sorta.

148
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,666
I mean, you know I really
haven't seen that much of him.

149
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,166
You're right.

150
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,791
When's the last time the three
of us had a meal together?

151
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,458
[TOWA] I don't know, but we
didn't talk about family.

152
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,916
[TOWA'S MOM] Your stepdad's
nervous, too, you know.

153
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,208
He has a hard time
discussing it.

154
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,333
He's being respectful.

155
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,375
[TOWA'S MOM]
You both are.

156
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,541
Uh? [laughs]

157
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,791
[TOWA'S MOM]
Listen, Towa.

158
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,375
[TOWA]
Yeah?

159
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,916
Were you upset that
I got remarried?

160
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,375
[TOWA]
Well, yeah. Of course, I was.

161
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:17,333
And even though it was a done
deal, I kept running from it.

162
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,875
What?

163
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:24,458
I've been such a jerk. Sorry,
Mom. For the other day, too.

164
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,750
You're the most important thing
in the world to me, Towa.

165
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,583
Please know, your stepdad
understands that.

166
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,958
I wish you'd value your
own feelings more.

167
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,000
My feelings don't matter.

168
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,875
[TOWA'S MOM]
Towa...

169
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,708
[TOWA] I always act like
I have it all figured out,

170
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:47,125
but I'm just a pathetic coward.
And that's the truth.

171
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,000
No, Towa...

172
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,375
[TOWA]
I try to be nice to her,

173
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,791
but then I just get mad
at her, over nothing.

174
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,041
[TOWA]
I know what I should do, but I--

175
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,583
But I...

176
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,458
[gasps]

177
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,375
I'm cutting the cake.

178
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,666
[HARUKI]
I'll go get some plates for us.

179
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,625
[BOTH laugh]

180
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,166
[TOWA'S MOM]
Towa?

181
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,375
[TOWA]
Sorry. I gotta go.

182
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,791
[TOWA'S MOM]
Where?

183
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,375
[TOWA panting]

184
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,833
I'm so scared, but I
can't keep running away.

185
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,666
Because now I know
she feels the same way.

186
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,916
[TOWA'S MOM]
Huh?

187
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,250
Say "hi" for me
when he gets back.

188
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,375
Tell him I look forward
to talking to him later.

189
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,750
I won't run away anymore.

190
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,958
I'm sorry, guys. I wish I
could stay a bit longer.

191
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:51,208
It's okay. I'm so glad
you came. It was fun.

192
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,291
Thanks again.

193
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,708
Aw, poor Towa.
Sad he didn't make it.

194
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,625
It couldn't be helped.

195
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,083
Besides...

196
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,083
[MAMI]
Please excuse me. Gotta go, bye!

197
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,625
[phone rings]

198
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,583
Who's that?

199
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,208
[MAMI]
Hello?

200
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,750
Class rep, are you still
over at Miharu's house?

201
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:14,541
Don't leave!

202
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,125
Huh?

203
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:20,666
[TOWA] I want to talk to you in
person, and don't say you can't.

204
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,541
Wait for me okay?
Even for a minute, or a second!

205
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,250
Class rep!

206
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,583
You okay?

207
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,041
[phone rings]

208
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,583
What's up?

209
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,958
[TOWA panting]

210
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,083
[panting continues]

211
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:24,041
[panting continues]

212
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,916
[TOWA]
Huh?

213
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,625
[sighs]

214
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,416
[MAMI] I'm sorry,
but I can't come home yet.

215
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,416
Just a little longer.

216
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:26,250
[MAMI] No. Please,
it's really important.

217
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:30,666
In fact, it's what's most
important to me right now!

218
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,833
You don't get it!
This is my priority!

219
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,625
[MAMI]
Okay, I will, thanks.

220
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,791
[TOWA]
You could've stayed at Miharu's.

221
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:58,541
Were you so desperate to see me
that you just couldn't wait?

222
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,000
[laughs]

223
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,166
[TOWA]
Here.

224
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,875
Thank you.

225
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,666
Uh, am I too close?

226
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,250
Maybe.

227
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,458
About the other day.

228
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,041
Yeah?

229
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,500
I took things out on you.

230
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm sorry. I feel awful.

231
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,166
Can you forgive me?

232
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:49,000
All I want, is just to be
acknowledged for what I do.

233
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,458
[TOWA]
Uh?

234
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,166
I've always tried so
hard to be perfect.

235
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,458
But, you were right,
there's no such thing.

236
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,208
Wait, I--

237
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,833
But, now I know what matters.

238
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:05,458
It just feels so weird to be...
bound by your family.

239
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,708
Does that make sense?

240
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,083
But it's not weird!

241
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:11,125
You're bound because
they're your family.

242
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,916
I'm actually the same.

243
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,208
My issue wasn't that bad,

244
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:20,000
but it was really hard
for me to deal with.

245
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,541
And so, I kept
running away from it.

246
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,458
Which is lame.

247
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,458
What? No, it isn't.

248
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,666
Hey, thank you.

249
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,666
[MAMI]
Why?

250
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,250
It's all thanks to you,
class rep.

251
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,500
I think about you.
Like, all the time.

252
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,083
Whether you get mad
at me again, or,

253
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,500
if I make you smile,
I don't care.

254
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,375
I want all of it.

255
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,000
[MAMI gasps]

256
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,500
You're the one who
helped me realize

257
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,416
what's most important
to me, class rep.

258
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,583
It was always you.

259
00:18:56,666 --> 00:19:00,875
I realized how important
you are to me too, Towa.

260
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,458
You changed me.

261
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,458
And we'll keep
changing, together.

262
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,958
Yeah.

263
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,791
[TOWA] I'm growing up,
little by little.

264
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,458
[MAMI]
Me, too.

265
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,375
[TOWA]
I'll do my best.

266
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,583
[MAMI]
Yeah. So will I.

267
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,916
That guy is such
a pain in the ass.

268
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,458
It's just like Towa, though.
He's always so direct.

269
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,291
[giggles] I just thought
of something.

270
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:34,416
Way back last spring, we asked
you about Towa, remember?

271
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Yeah, sure.

272
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,291
That was the first
time we talked.

273
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,791
Actually, no it wasn't.

274
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,791
Huh?

275
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,375
We'd talked before then.

276
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,666
It wasn't the first time
we had talked.

277
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,291
[inaudible]

278

[MIHARU laughs]

[MIHARU]
Look, it's snowing.

280
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,916
[HARUKI]
Oh!

281
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,000
I guess we should get going.

282
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,291
Yeah.

283
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,333
[gasps]

284
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:39,291
I wish we had more time.

285
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:45,291
So, does this mean
we're okay now?

286
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,250
Idiot.

287
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,083
[laughs] Right.

288
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,708
Uh, you say one thing
and do another.

289
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,083
I'm not sure what to do.

290
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,000
Heh.

291
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,416
Ah! It's freezing.

292
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:15,875
[MIHARU]
Here.

293
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,916
[HARUKI]
Huh?

294
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,666
It's for you.
A Christmas present.

295
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,500
Wow! But I didn't
get you anything.

296
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,875
[laughs] It's okay.

297
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,916
[HARUKI laughs]

298
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,166
I hope you like it!

299
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,250
Huh? Are you kidding me?
I love it! Thank you!

[SAKAMOTO] January.
A new season, a new year.

301
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,625
But, spring still feels
so far away.

302
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:58,541
Feelings that were flickering
faintly, begin to take shape.

303
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:01,000
Transparent and
undefined like water,

304
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:05,250
flowing through one's fingers,
but unquestionably there.

305
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:09,416
A significant, unignorable
feeling, born in his heart.

306

where their story begins.
