Jeez, I just wanted to say hi.

I think he might
actually turn into one.

Yeah, I definitely
noticed he's fond of them.

Ah, I see you've been
watching him closely, then.

So, anyway were you girls
all right the other day?

the class rep in on that fact.

is the cold shoulder.

to work up the courage.
