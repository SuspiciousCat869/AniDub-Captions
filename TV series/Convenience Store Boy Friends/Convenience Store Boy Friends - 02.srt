"The Merman Prince."

"Once upon a time, there was
a royal family of mermen

00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:20,916
who lived at the bottom
of a deep, blue ocean."

00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:26,208
"This is a story of the tiny
prince of the merfolk kingdom

who went on a quest
to find a girl."

"His journey was
long and tiring,

and he traveled far across
the sea to find her ship.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,333
Once he finally found
the one she was on,

00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:46,708
he gathered all his strength,
swam up beside it,

10
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,291

'Where is this coral
you speak of?'

17

He said, 'It's at the bottom
of the deep, blue sea.'

18
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,333
'I'd like to see it,'

Aw, man, it didn't come close.

Just like, try not to bother
that class rep so much.

But when a girl says
"no," that's a "yes"!

00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,250
Not really.

You know, if you're not careful,

00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,375
that attitude is gonna get
you in big trouble someday.

to keep my mouth shut.

Well, you sure
could have fooled me.

See, it's only natural.

When there's a fragile girl
who needs some help,

105
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,000
it's a man's job to save her.

would rely on me more often.

He did promise you he
wouldn't tell anybody, right?

Yes, he did, but maybe
he's saving it for later.

For when he really needs it.

come to save you.

00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,916
Oh, I see.

166
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,291
You don't have to.

167
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,250
Oh, no. It's fine.

168
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,083
Well, what's up?

169
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,750
It's about Towa.

170
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,458
I don't believe he's
a bad person.

171
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:59,791
But would you mind maybe
having a little talk with him?

172
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,916
[HARUKI]
So, in other words...

173
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,208
[MAMI] I'd like him to
leave me alone, please.

174
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,833
[HARUKI]
Oh. I hear you.

175
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,916
I've known him a while and
he really doesn't mean

176
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,166
any harm.

177
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,416
He just has some
trouble with respecting

178
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,416
personal space and boundaries,

179
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,458
regardless of whether
it's girls or whoever.

180
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:24,750
I understand that,
but I, I don't--

181
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:25,958
I just can't.

182
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
[MIHARU]
Haruki!

183
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,958
[HARUKI]
Miharu.

184
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,500
[HARUKI]
What's wrong?

185
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,708
[MIHARU]
So, thanks for today.

186
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,875
Hope I didn't put
you on the spot.

187
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,625
Sorry if I did.

188
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,750
[HARUKI]
Oh, it's totally fine.

189
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,333
I mean, I haven't done
anything for you yet.

190
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,583
But I was right.

191
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,125
I knew you'd be willing
and able to help out.

192
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,041
Huh? But how did you--?

193
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,791
I just did.

194
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,083
Hey, you're sweating. Here.

195
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,666
Oh, uh...
I'm, uh... I'm fine.

196
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,875
Okay, goodnight, then.

197
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,166
[doorbell rings]

198
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,750
[TOWA]
Honey, I'm home!

199
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,333
Oh, Towa!
You're back again?

200
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,875
[TOWA] Yeah, I thought
I'd help you level up

201
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:23,791
in that game later.

202
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,125
Cool!

203
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,000
Hey, what's up, Haruki?

204
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,125
Towa, we need to talk.

205
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,291
Okay.

206
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,208
[TOWA] So, what did you
want to talk about then?

207
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,250
[HARUKI clears throat]

208
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,041
Well, it's about Mami,
the class rep.

209
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:53,916
[TOWA coughs]

210
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,708
Easy.

211
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,250
Sorry. [coughs]

212
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,458
I just wasn't expecting
to hear that name.

213
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,708
Anyway, why?

214
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,833
Well, we had a
conversation today.

215
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,541
Uh, you did? About what?

216
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,625
She told me you've
been bothering her a lot,

217
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,291
and it makes her
very uncomfortable.

218
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,333
[TOWA]
What?!

219
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,166
For real?

220
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,250
For real.

221
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,375
To you, I'm sure
that sorta stuff's

222
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,666
just like saying hello,

223
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,833
but dude, please,

224
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,833
you have got to leave her alone.

225
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,916
So stop. She doesn't like it.

226
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,708
[HARUKI]
Hey, man.

227
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,958
Wait. Do you...

228
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,208
...really like her?

229
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,625
Ugh!

230
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,083
In that case,
you should've taken

231
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,958
a more sincere approach.

232
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,041
To be honest,
she's not getting it at all.

233
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,750
xactly what I did.

234
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:54,666
I told her she's cute,
and like... pretty.

235
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,666
That just makes you seem
even more insincere, though.

236
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,541
You do come off as a joker.

237
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,791
At least I make an effort,

238
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,916
unlike you who's too
scared to say anything.

239
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,416
What?

240
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,291
You barely have the stones
to say hi to that Miharu girl.

241
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,208
I keep telling you,
it isn't even like that.

242
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,500
With that rotten attitude,

243
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,500
you're never gonna get
the chance to find out.

244
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,125
Look who's talking, you idiot!

245
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:17,875
What's that?

246
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:18,875
You little wussy!

247
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,166
Shut up, you bastard!

248
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,625
Make me, closet perv!

249
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,583
[BOTH grunting]

250
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,750
[TOWA]
You asshat! Get offa me!

251
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,416
[HARUKI]
You never let anything go!

252
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,833
Shut up!

253
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:46,833
[HARUKI]
Aki, wait--

254
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,166
[AKIRA]
Mom! I knew it!

255
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,875
Haruki's gay!

256
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:51,958
[laughs]

257
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:07,291
[TOWA]
Yeah, it's fine.

258
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,583
Right, I know.

259
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,083
Bye.

260
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,666
So, what'd your mom say?

261
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,791
[TOWA]
Nothing, really.

262
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:31,375
She's actually still
working tonight, late.

263
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,541
Guess it woulda been better
to call them earlier.

264
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,375
[TOWA]
Hey.

265
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,416
[HARUKI]
Yeah?

266
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,041
[TOWA]
Never mind.

267
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,416
[HARUKI]
Come on, what?

268
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,791
[TOWA]
Was the class rep... angry?

269
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,416
Uh, well, to be honest with you,

270
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,250
she seemed more sad than angry.

271
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,291
[TOWA]
Really?

272
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,791
[TOWA] We're totally
different, aren't we?

273
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,041
[HARUKI]
Yeah.

274
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,125
[TOWA]
Think we're a good match?

275
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,208
[HARUKI]
Dunno.

276
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,666
[TOWA]
Don't be such a shitty friend.

277
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,958
You're supposed to say yes.

278
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,083
[HARUKI] But I can't.
I really don't know.

279
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,083
One thing I like--

280
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:19,541
She's just so honest
about her emotions.

281
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:24,291
[TOWA] One minute, she seems
bored, then she gets mad.

282
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,208
She has that sort
of awkward smile.

283
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,416
She can be friendly,
or terrifying.

284
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,750
I have to admit...

285
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,500
[TOWA] You know me.
I pretty much like all girls.

286
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,750
There's something... special...

287
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,916
...about... class rep.

288
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,875
Well then, I've got your back.

289
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,416
[HARUKI sighs]

290
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,875
[HARUKI] So the truth is,
the only thing he really wants

291
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,583
is to be friends with Mami.

292
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,625
[TOWA]
Mm-hmm.

293
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
[HARUKI] But he can
be a little impulsive,

294
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,583
so if he happens to do
something that upsets you,

295
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,833
tell him directly.

296
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,541
No need to hold back.

297
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,791
[TOWA]
Hold me accountable!

298
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,750
[HARUKI]
I know he can be shallow,

299
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,041
and inappropriate sometimes,

300
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,500
but he has some
great qualities, too.

301
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,625
I can totally vouch
for him as a friend.

302
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,208
Please stop barking
out "class rep"

303
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,750
when you want to talk to me.

304
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,916
And no more
unsolicited touching.

305
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't like it.

306
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,041
I got it.

307
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,583
If you don't need anything,
then don't pester me.

308
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,916
Aw. Come on, you're no fun.

309
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
[HARUKI]
Towa.

310
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,000
I see.

311
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,750
Do you really hate me that much?

312
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,875
No, that's not it.

313
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,708
You still don't get it, do you?

314
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,416
Gah. Never mind.

315
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,375
What?

316
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,666
I said never mind, okay?

317
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,375
We're done talking now.

318
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
[MIHARU]
Go on.

319
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,750
So, we're good.

320
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,791
Well, I'm gonna head
off to school now.

321
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:22,833
Wait...

322
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,833
Ow! What--?!

323
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:28,875
[TOWA grunts]

324
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,208
Miharu!

325
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,791
Huh?

326
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:41,875
Hey, uh, so do you
want to walk to school?

327
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,833
Together? Like as a group?

328
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,416
Oh, yeah, the four of us!

329
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,958
Sure.

330
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,666
Please get back to work.

331
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,833
What are you smiling about, huh?

332
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,000
Oh, nothing.

333
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,791
I just like seeing nice things
happen to nice people.

334
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:49,916
[NARRATOR]
June.

335
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,875
When the sweet song
of birds can be heard

336
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,000
after warm summer rains.

337
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,500
Puddles of water that
glimmer in the light.

338
00:23:56,583 --> 00:24:00,083
Boys making splashing
sounds as they run along.

339
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:02,833
The showers at season's
arrival gift hydrangeas

340
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,458
their brilliant color,
and every passing day,

341
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:08,458
brings him and her
closer together.

342
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,833
Next time, on <i>Convenience</i>
<i>Store Boy Friends</i> .

343
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,208
Episode three: "June."

344
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:16,583
And this is the place
where their story begins.
