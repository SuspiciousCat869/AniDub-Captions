What?

166
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,875
You got mixed up in it too.

167
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,125
Squabbles among members
of the track-and-field club

168
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,125
are nothing new.

169
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,958
You just got caught in
the crossfire, first-year.

170
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah.

171
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,583
And I'm sure you must
have a great explanation

172
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:01,875
for this situation.

173
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,375
Regardless, you've stirred
up a lot of trouble.

174
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,875
So you'll both be punished.

175
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,375
I'll come up with
something creative.

176
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,625
Natsu.

177
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,000
For you, I've decided
that your penalty

178
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,666
is to help run
the sports festival.

179
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,708
What? Hang on, why me?

180
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,166
[MIKADO]
We need volunteers.

181
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,541
Kinda pushy.

182
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,625
Well, I mean, someone
around here has to be--

183
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,708
nobody would show up otherwise.

184
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,125
What about Waka?

185
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,166
Please. I'm not counting her.

186
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,708
Oh, I see. Got it.

187
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,791
[MIKADO] You can come
at lunch, after school,

188
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,125
or after practice.

189
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,750
I don't care when, but every day

190
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,166
you'll have to come
here and assist us.

191
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,375
That clear?

192
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,750
[NATSU]
Okay.

193
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,333
And we'll be counting
on you to show up, as well.

194
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,375
Right.

195
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,958
Wait, me? Really?

196
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,291
Yes, of course.

197
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,041
Don't worry.
I'll make sure the swim team

198
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,625
lets you off the hook.

199
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,375
[MASAMUNE]
Okay, go lend a hand.

200
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,583
[MIKADO] There's still a
mountain of work left to do,

201
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,166
so you'll be busy.

202
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,750
[MASAMUNE] Meanwhile, I'm gonna
go wrap up that other matter.

203
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,166
[MIKADO]
Sure.

204
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,625
I'll head to the
faculty office, then.

205
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:09,333
Anyway, you two go ask the
vice president for instructions.

206
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,541
[HARUKI sighs]

207
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,375
The hospital again?

208
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,875
Oh, why did I agree
to do this with you?

209
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,541
C'mon you're not
gonna back out now.

210
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,166
Well, it was your dumb idea!

211
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,708
Hey! I'm doing this
for Miharu too, ya know.

212
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,166
I need to make sure
this boyfriend of hers

213
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,458
is a decent guy.

214
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,500
With my own eyes.

215
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,166
This makes no sense whatsoever.

216
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,458
Why are boys so
stupid sometimes?

217
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,583
[TOWA]
There he goes!

218
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,166
I have a question.

219
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,625
Yeah?

220
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:07,250
What were you doing here
at the hospital earlier?

221
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,875
Uh... I had to...
drop something off.

222
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,791
Oh, crap!
Let's make a run for it.

223
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,375
[MAMI]
Ow! Hey, quit pushing me.

224
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,458
[NASA]
What are you two up to?

225
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:29,875
Um, we were--

226
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:30,916
Nothing.

227
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,500
Your face...

228
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,541
[HARUKI]
Are you okay?

229
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,750
Kinda seems like your
team has a lot going on.

230
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,583
Sounds rough.

231
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,125
[NATSU]
Not really.

232
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,625
I just want to run, that's it.

233
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,833
Um...

234
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,708
All you want to do is run, huh?

235
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,083
I understand exactly
what you mean.

236
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,541
I just want to swim.

237
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,375
What's your time?

238
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,208
[HARUKI] My freestyle's around
twenty-three, twenty-four.

239
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,666
[NATSU]
Impressive.

240
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,708
There are much faster guys.

241
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,250
To be honest, I don't really
care about my times.

242
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,625
How can you not care about it?

243
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,541
The times don't matter.

244
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,791
What I love most is
being in the water.

245
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,291
Yeah.

246
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,458
I know what you mean.

247
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:53,083
When I'm running,
I don't worry about anything.

248
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,625
All I feel is the
breeze on my face.

249
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:57,958
That sounds awesome.

250
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,333
[MIKADO]
Right, that's enough for today.

251
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,833
You're both free to go.

252
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,041
[MASAMUNE]
Thanks for helping.

253
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,791
[NATSU]
Okay, goodbye then.

254
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:07,875
[HARUKI]
Goodbye.

255
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,208
[MIKADO]
See you tomorrow.

256
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,416
[HARUKI]
Aww, damn it.

257
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,166
[NATSU] It's really
coming down out there.

258
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,375
Get home safely, okay? Bye.

259
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,541
What? No umbrella?

260
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,166
[NATSU]
I'm taking the bus.

261
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,416
[HARUKI]
Okay, sure then.

262
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,583
I'll see you later.

263
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,208
[SAKAMOTO]
Welcome.

264
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,000
Where are they?

265
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,458
Man...

266
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,375
[HARUKI]
Just this, please.

267
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,291
[SAKAMOTO]
Very good, thank you.

268
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,750
Sorry about that.

269
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,291
Once the rain started,
we sold out in a heartbeat.

270
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,625
That will be 540 yen.

271
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,666
I assume you don't need a bag.

272
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,500
Oh, actually...

273
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,166
Let me help you out.

274
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,375
[HARUKI]
Thanks a lot.

275
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,666
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

276
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,833
[MIHARU]
Whenever you want.

277
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,458
So, have you been
volunteering this whole time?

278
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,708
[HARUKI]
Yeah, I have.

279
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,791
[MIHARU]
Ah! Sounds like a lot of fun.

280
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,208
[HARUKI]
Uh... Really?

281
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,500
[MIHARU] The handicraft
club is doing it, too.

282
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,291
Did you see the banner
near the school gate?

283
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,250
[HARUKI]
It's huge, you couldn't miss it!

284
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,375
[MIHARU]
Yeah.

285
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,708
We're making flags
for the cheer squad

286
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,666
and balls for
the ball-toss, too.

287
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,750
[HARUKI]
Wow, exciting.

288
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,041
Wait, a ball-toss?

289
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,416
[MIHARU chuckles]
That's what I thought, too.

290
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,250
Aren't high-school
students a little old

291
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,416
for that kind of thing?

292
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,208
Oh, I'm sorry.

293
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,916
It's fine. No harm done.

294
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,541
I bet you'll stand out.

295
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,458
[HARUKI]
Huh?

296
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,916
[MIHARU]
At the sports festival.

297
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,291
You're a star athlete,
aren't you?

298
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,666
[HARUKI]
I don't know about that.

299
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,125
I'm okay in the water.

300
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,500
Well you sure did
stand out in middle school.

301
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,125
That's because all the other
guys weren't really that--

302
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,875
Hey, wait a second.

303
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,333
When you say middle school...

304
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,375
Um, uh...

305
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,291
Right, right. Never mind.

306
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,833
[HARUKI]
Hey, uh... listen...

307
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,500
Forget it, it's nothing.

308
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,625
Actually...

309
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,875
[MIHARU]
Uh... Oh, no!

310
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,541
Hold on, stay right here.

311
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,083
Keep still a sec.

312
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,291
Okay.

313
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,875
[MIHARU] If we don't clean this
right now, it'll leave a stain.

314
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,833
Thank you for that.

315
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,041
Are-- Are you sure
the guy you're seeing

316
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,750
would be okay with this?

317
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,291
What do you mean?

318
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,916
Oh, you know, that guy, I mean.
Your boyfriend, or whatever.

319
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,041
Uh... I don't have one!

320
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,708
What?

321
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,541
I just said I don't
have a boyfriend.

322
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,500
And I really wish you
wouldn't say things like that,

323
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:09,583
if you don't mind.

324
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,916
I'm all set now.

325
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,041
Thank you, I appreciate it.

326
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,083
Sure.

327
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,833
Goodnight. Say hello to Haruki.

328
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,750
[TOWA] Which way you headed?
I'll walk you home.

329
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:44,791
Walk me home?

330
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:45,833
For real?

331
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:46,916
Yeah, 'course.

332
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,083
[MAMI]
Why would you do that?

333
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,583
Because I... uh...

334
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,833
Nothing.

335
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,916
--Okay, bye!
--Oh, bye.

336
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,291
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

337
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,166
[phone ringing]

338
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,458
--Hello?
--[TOWA] You finally answered!

339
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,875
Good news, buddy!

340
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,500
You should thank me
big time, bro.

341
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,875
The class rep and I just spent
the entire day investigating.

342
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,333
[HARUKI]
Investigating what?

343
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,416
Miharu's guy, that's what.

344
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,625
[NASA]
I'm just here to see a doctor

345
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,500
that I had a few
previous visits with.

346
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,875
As for Miharu,
we've bumped into each other

347
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,250
up here a few times now.

348
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,333
We're just acquaintances,
that's all.

349
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,833
His own words!

350
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,375
Ahem!

351
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,958
So according to our thorough
research, she's actually single!

352
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:37,791
I know.

353
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,208
[TOWA]
What? But how?

354
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,375
It doesn't matter.

355
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,083
Anyway, did you
follow him around all day,

356
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,000
or did you finally
leave him alone?

357
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,291
[TOWA]
Hey, don't be such a dick!

358
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,291
I was only trying
to help you both get--

359
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,333
Oh, whatever.

360
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,625
[click, line beeping]

361
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,541
[NARRATOR] July, when the
sky is blindingly blue.

362
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:55,041
White sneakers
trample green fields.

363
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,166
Yells that pierce the clouds.

364
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,541
The moment heat
collides with heat.

365
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,416
Heading towards that moment

366
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,708
when he and she
match one another's pace

367
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,625
as they feel the warmth
of each other's skin.

368
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:11,666
Next time on <i>Convenience Store</i>
<i>Boyfriends</i> , episode four.

369
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,000
"July."

370
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:16,333
And this is the place
where their story begins.
