live in the flesh!

316
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,583
You'll get pollen on you.

317
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,958
You're awesome,
Dragon!

318
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,583
Like the coolest!

319
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,375
[KAZAMA] You kiddos
been having fun?

320
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,541
[CLUB BOY 11C] Aw, yeah!

321
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,583
[CLUB BOY 11A]
You look like a gangster!

322
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,708
Hey, Tamura, been too long.

323
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,583
I brought a little
bouquet for you.

324
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,708
[TAMURA] Be still
my beating heart.

325
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,833
Not even sure I have a vase.

326
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,208
D'you have some time
to catch up, Tsukimoto?

327
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,333
He's busy.

328
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,500
I can go.

329
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,750
What?!

330
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,833
[TAMURA] Yeesh.

331
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,666
Guy hardly coaches
when he's here,

332
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,458
and now he's skippin'
out entirely.

333
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,416
Doesn't get it from me,
that's for sure.

334
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,416
[TAMURA] Let's go, brats!
Hop to it!

335
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,250
[CLUB CHILDREN]
Okay, Coach!

336
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,625
You need something?

337
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,875
The hot pot.
Where is it?

338
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,625
You wanna make
stew in June?

339
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,000
Makoto's coming today, dear.

340
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,791
[MRS. KOIZUMI] Yes,
but not until dinner!

341
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,000
It's barely past noon!

342
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,583
[KOIZUMI] Just help me find
the damn thing, wouldja?

343
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,250
[KAZAMA]
Middle school teacher?

344
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,416
Not sure I would'a pegged you
for that kinda career, man.

345
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,416
I start student
teaching next week.

346
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,916
It's a cryin' shame.

347
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,208
You could'a been a brilliant
pro athlete, Tsukimoto.

348
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,416
One'a the best.

349
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,166
Well thanks.
You're the only one

350
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,208
who still tells me that kinda
stuff these days, Kazama.

351
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,166
And I have to admit it's
nice hearing it again.

352
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,708
[KAZAMA] Ah!

353
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:54,583
Aw.

354
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,250
[TSUKIMOTO laughs]

355
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,833
[KAZAMA] Damn it!

356
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,416
[KAZAMA] So I don't
know if you keep up,

357
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,041
but I got cut from
the National Team.

358
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,833
[TSUKIMOTO]
Yeah, I heard.

359
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,458
Kong's doing well these days.

360
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,291
[KAZAMA] I used to hate
my father so much

361
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,791
for the life he chose.

362
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,125
But lately I'm feeling
more and more like him.

363
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,541
I worry sometimes.

364
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,708
That I'll become an
unremarkable player

365
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,791
who only dreams
about the glory days.

366
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,250
Who cares if you do?

367
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,583
Not me.

368
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,125
I like unremarkable, actually.

369
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,333
[KAZAMA] Yeah well,
I'm not okay with it!

370
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,625
Dumbass.

371
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,708
[SPECTATORS chatter]

372
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,916
[GERMAN ANNOUNCER, in German]
We'll now begin the fifth match!

373
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,083
[in English] Hey Peco!
That's you, move yer butt!

374
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,625
[HOSHINO]
Whoops! Coming!

375
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,125
[GERMAN ANNOUNCER, in German]
The Japanese ace aiming for

376
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:58,583
the top in a sport where China
dominates the world rankings!

377
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,750
Yutaka Hoshino!
[SPECTATORS cheer]

378
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,500
[HOSHINO, in English]
Yo! Danke, danke!

379
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,833
I love 'ya, guys!

380
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,750
[TSUKIMOTO] Y'hear Akuma's
wife's pregnant again?

381
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,833
[KAZAMA]
Their third now, right?

382
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,541
Yeah.

383
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,458
He's gonna buy his own
truck and go independent.

384
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,750
Says he won't be able to
come by the dojo for a while.

385
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,625
[KAZAMA] Really?

386
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,333
Ah! Damn!

387
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,333
[TSUKIMOTO] Needs money
to feed all those babies.

388
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh, and the woman
from the Poseidon ads

389
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,750
was in the news, wasn't she?

390
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,125
[KAZAMA]
You do keep up.

391
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,541
[TSUKIMOTO] Everything's
on the web these days.

392
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,541
You actually
look us up online?

393
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,583
Yeah, I do.

394
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,416
[KAZAMA] Damn it!

395
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,583
What about you?
Have a girlfriend?

396
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,166
[TSUKIMOTO]
Wouldn't you like to know?

397
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,708
[KAZAMA]
That's a yes!

398
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,083
I wonder.

399
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,833
Did I go wrong somewhere?

400
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,250
You know what.

401
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,708
Maybe staking your life on
table tennis isn't so bad.

402
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,458
Won't be doin' that again.

403
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,041
No way.

404
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,875
[TSUKIMOTO]
Summer is coming soon.

405
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,791
[KAZAMA] Yup.

406
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,041
[TSUKIMOTO] We're getting
back into busy season.

407
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,458

No doubt.
