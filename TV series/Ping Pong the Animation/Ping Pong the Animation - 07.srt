there are fish that actually
choose to live in the backwater.

They're content with it.

just never change!

Of course, he's been consulted.

a great opportunity.

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,500
I must say,
I was rather surprised

102
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,416
to learn Koizumi
was coaching here.

Well, I...

110
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,000
It's just that...

111

I apologize
for that, sir.

112

Don't worry about it.

113
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,208
Whatever that boy is chasing,

114
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,625
it's not money
or fame or success.

115
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,791
Those aren't the
only reasons to play.

Perhaps, but Dad did it wrong.

120
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,208
And he had no talent.

121
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,458
Put that aside.

122
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,833
Tell me, are you playing
the kind of table tennis

123
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,250

124
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,625
You know that
I worry about you.

times to be sick!

doing such crap business,

you wouldn't get all
these strange diseases!

[EMIKO]
Mother is fine.

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,041
All families have
their own sets of rules,

133
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,541
so please, just try
to bear with it.

134
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,666
[TAKU] So kiddo,
who would your hero be?

135
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,833
There are no heroes.

136
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,750
[KOIZUMI] Sorry if it
seemed like I was trying

137
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,666
to get rid of you,
Mr. Tsukimoto.

138
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,125
But this old man
can't give you

139
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,625
the coaching a player
with your skills deserves.

140
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,083
We both know we've
reached the limit

141
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,208
of what I can teach you.

142
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,916
Guess I figured
if you went to Kaio,

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,083
you'd finally have
some room to grow.

144
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,541
Yeah, but, sir--

145
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,791
Huh?

146
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,416
[TSUKIMOTO] I got Sakuma
kicked out, remember?

147
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,375
How do you think Kaio
will react if I show up there?

148
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,708
[KOIZUMI] It's not like you to
let something like that bother--

149
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,541
Well even I have feelings.

150
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,750
I get sad or happy
like anyone else does.

151
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:17,750
Here I go.

152
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,416
Hey! Wait for me, yeah?

153
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,583
You'll wear yourself
out at that pace!

154
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,833
Didn't you hear
what I said, boy?

155
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,083
Slow down! Slow down!

156
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,750
Holy cow, Chump!

157
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,500
This dojo you
teach at is massive!

158
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,041
It's like bigger
than a shopping mall!

159
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:33,916
Peco.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,708
This is not some measly dojo!

161
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,416
Athletes can't just
wander in here!

162
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,583
Their potential must be
recognized by the state!

163
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,500
Which means you've
been recognized, kid.

164
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,291
Congrats.

165
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,833
Hold on, Mom, not so fast!

166
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:45,666
There are rules!

167
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,583
Ooh, a Ping-Pong girl!

168
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,541
And hey!
Quit calling me "Chump!"

169
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,166
Yeah, yeah,
hurry and take us in.

170
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,833
[MICHIO]
Everyone!

171
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,458
Hoshino here will be
practicing with us from now on!

172
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,166
So welcome him with open arms!

173
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,250
Understood?

174
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,416
[NATIONAL TRAINING
PLAYERS] Yes, sir!

175
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,541
Yutaka Hoshino. Call me Peco.

176
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,125
Sixteen, Capricorn,
Type-O, fast offense.

177
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,958
It's a pleasure
to meet all of you!

178
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,625
[KOKUBU]
Three more minutes!

179
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,041
[NATIONAL TRAINING
PLAYERS] Yes, sir!

180
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,458
You call that
a fast offense, Peco?

181
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,916
C'mon, move, move, move!

182
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,958
Trying!

183
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,000
[MICHIO] Gotta keep
your eye on the ball!

184
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,208
Don't just trust your gut!

185
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,750
Use your eyes, kid!

186
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,125
Time!

187
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,666
Kokubu, let's switch.

188
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,708
Sure!

189
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,416
This is hard!

190
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,625
[HAMA-CHON] Has our little robot
finally gone totally haywire?

191
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,416
[TAKAMURA] Good luck trying
to find tech support

192
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,916
for a freak like that.

193
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,416
So your boy Smile
ran away, did he?

194
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,833
[KOIZUMI]
Yeah.

195
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,916
I've tried calling his house,
but no one's picked up.

196
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,291
His folks split up when
he was still real young.

197
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,875
Dad's out of the
picture completely,

198
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,708
and Mom won't be
home until morning.

199
00:08:58,791 --> 00:08:59,791
[KOIZUMI]
And here I thought

200
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,500
I was doing right
by the boy, but...

201
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,958
That's why people
run away from you.

202
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,041
[KOIZUMI]
Huh?

203
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,791
You're always
doing that, you know.

204
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,333
Acting all timid and reserved,

205
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,250
worried about how
your students feel.

206
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,625
They don't respond to that crap.

207
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,291
Kids need clarity.

208
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,041
If you truly
care about the boy,

209
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,916
grab him in your arms,
squeeze him tight

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,833
and give him a big ol' kiss.

211
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,458
But if you can't give
him the love he needs,

212
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,500
then get the hell
out of his life.

213
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,958
This is so dumb.

214
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,458
[PECO'S BROTHER A]
Come on, Peco, wake up!

215
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,958
[PECO'S BROTHER B]
Chump's gonna be so mad!

216
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,083
[PECO'S BROTHER C]
Ooh, you're not supposed

217
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,500
to call him "Chump."

218
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,125
[PECO'S BROTHER A] Come on,
we gotta wake him up!

219
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:53,958
[PECO'S BROTHER B]
Peco!

220
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:54,958
[PECO'S BROTHER C]
Peco!

221
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,291
[PECO'S BROTHER A]
What do we do?

222
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,583
[HOSHINO] You know, I gotta
give at least some of the credit

223
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,083
for this victory
to my loyal fans

224
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,208
and all their support!

225
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,291
I mean it! You guys
are the greatest!

226
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,208
What's my dream?

227
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,458
Well, obviously, I wouldn't mind

228
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,375
winning a couple gold
medals at the Olympics!

229
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,333
And I'd love a part in
an Akagi Nyugyo commercial!

230
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:23,208
[humming]

231
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:33,333
[humming]

232
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,500
[KOIZUMI]
Welcome back, son.

233
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,666
Where'd you run off to?

234
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,750
Nowhere, really.
Just wandered around.

235
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,833
I see.

236
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,875
[TSUKIMOTO] Have you been
waiting this whole time?

237
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,541
I've told you
a million times,

238
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,166
a coach's job only has meaning

239
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,583
when he's got
an athlete to train.

240
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,708
But next time you
pull a stunt like that,

241
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,583
I am gonna smack ya.

242
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,833
Are we clear, Mr. Tsukimoto?

243
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:03,875
Yes.

244
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,625
Yes, my coach.

245
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,625
Beautiful.

246
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,375
Music to my ears.

247
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,083
Well good morning,
Mr. Tsukimoto.

248
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,541
Hey, good morning, Coach.

249
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,625
What's up?

250
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,500
Lovely weather today, yeah?

251
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,458
I guess.

252
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,333
It's gotta be
a bummer for ya,

253
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,500
spending your Valentine's Day
training with an old geezer.

254
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,916
No, not really.

255
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,958
You don't mind? At all?

256
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,000
Nah.

257
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,791
Whaddya say,
Mr. Tsukimoto?

258
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,083
Wanna go on a date?

259
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,083
[TSUKIMOTO]
Uhh...

260
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,125
[KOIZUMI]
With me.

261
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,041
[MATAKI SALESMAN]
Hey, Hikaru.

262
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,291
We're closing down the store,
so go ahead and take some stuff.

263
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,083
On the house.

264
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,416
[OTA]
I couldn't!

265
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,625
[MATAKI SALESMAN]
You play ping-pong, don'tcha?

266
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,375
[OTA]
Whoa, these are three-star!

267
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,000
Badass!

268
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,875
[MATAKI SALESMAN]
You like 'em? Take 'em.

269
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,791
[OTA] Thanks, but I
wanna pay you for them.

270
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,333
[MATAKI SALESMAN]
Don't be silly.

271
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,791
Everyone's gotta switch over
to plastic balls now, anyway.

272
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,416
I heard you haven't
been able to practice

273
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,750
as much as you'd like, so I
bought a ping-pong robot.

274
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,583
It's the latest,
most advanced model!

275
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,291
I've already loaded it up with
as much data as I could find

276
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,125
on Kazama from Kaio.

277
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,625
Please, use it as
a sparring partner.

278
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,666
[KONG]
Thank you.

279
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,041
[singing bowl ringing]

280
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,875
[TAKU]
Morning. Happy birthday.

281
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,458
[YURIE]
Aw, how sweet.

282
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,875
[YURIE]
And for you.

283
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,208
Well, you've sure
been busy already.

284
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,375
[YURIE]
Somethin' to drink?

285
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,125
[TAKU]
Coffee. Plain black.

286
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,083
[YURIE] Oh, why'd I have to
be born on Valentine's Day?

287
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,583
Sorry 'bout that.

288
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,500
[YURIE] I always wind up giving
other people stuff all day

289
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,041
and nobody ever
remembers my birthday!

290
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,583
An' it's the same
day Nori died, too.

291
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,958
[YURIE] Here you go,
nice and bitter.

292
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,791
Was Uncle Norio unpopular?

293
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,875
[TAKU] He was a great
table tennis coach.

294
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:53,916
Some of the kids he taught

295
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,375
are still playing
as adults today.

296
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,833
Ryuichi's style is a lot
like Nori's, actually.

297
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,666
[YURIE] Why's Grampa so hard
on him all the time, though?

298
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,000
Well, to be fair,

299
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,875
the old man's always
been hard on himself, too.

300
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,583
[YURIE] You know, Ryu
never even calls Aunt Emiko.

301
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,541
[TAKU]
He promised your grandfather

302
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,250
he'd only contact her
on days of remembrance.

303
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,916
[YURIE] Yeah, but does
he have to do everything

304
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,333
Grampa tells him to?

305
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,833
[KAIO PRESIDENT]
Taku, stop crying.

306
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,625
Boys should never let
anyone see them cry.

307
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,083
Never show weakness!

308
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,958
People will only
take advantage of you!

309
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,958
After your grandfather
took responsibility

310
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,916
for all Nori's
business failures,

311
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
our relatives shunned
Nori's branch of the family

312
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,666
out of embarrassment.

313
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,125
Frankly, it went
beyond what was fair.

314
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,666
Of course,

315
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,958
once Grampa saw that Ryuichi
had a knack for table tennis,

316
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,500
his attitude changed,
and as Ryuichi kept winning,

317
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,083
the family had no choice
but to embrace him.

318
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,458
Now that boy is trying
to carry his family,

319
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,833
our school, and even
Poseidon on his shoulders.

320
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,250
Well, that's not for me!

321
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,916
I want to do something
else with my life,

322
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,500
like arrange flowers.

323
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,500
And I'm gonna study in London.

324
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,125
We don't have
that kind of money!

325
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,791
I'd have to ask
your Grampa for help.

326
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,208
No, I don't want his money.

327
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,458
I'll manage myself somehow.

328
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,500
He may be overly
strict and a bit scary,

329
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,541
but he does know
what he's doing.

330
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:13,458
He's a very shrewd businessman
with great instincts.

331
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,458
I mean, it never even
would've occurred to me

332
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,916
to sell mats and
shoes the way he does.

333
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,500
[YURIE]
So what?

334
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,041
[KAIO PLAYERS]
One!

today is?

338
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,541
Did you know that ever
since you told Yurie

339
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,208
not to come to our games,

340
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,625
she's been showing up
anyway, in disguise?

341
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,750

00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,166
[SANADA]
Hi.

349
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,333
Um, hello, Miss Yurie.

350
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,041
I'm a teammate of Kazama's.

351
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,583
Masayuki Sanada, Kaio Table
Tennis Club, second year!

352
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,291
I've been watching
you from afar!

353
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,125
Happy birthday!
I got these flowers for you!

354
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,375
Aw, really?

355
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,833
Ooh, I love Casablancas!

356
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:13,875
Thank you!

357
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,833
[SANADA] I am painfully
aware that you like Kazama.

358
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:21,583
I only wish for you to know
who I am and that I exist.

You are quite beautiful, Miss!

[SANADA]
Thank you!

00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,000

363

[SANADA]
This is mine now, Kazama.

364
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,541
Whatcha gonna do about it?

365
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,916
Whatcha gonna do,
table tennis freak?

366
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,916
I'm gonna
make her mine, too.

367
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,625
I'm gonna beat you.

368
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,083
And take your girl.

369
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,708
You okay with that?

370
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,833
What's wrong,
Mr. Tsukimoto?

371
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,750
Isn't this a blast?

372
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,666
People usually laugh
when they have fun!

373
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,250
Hahaha!

374
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,583
[TSUKIMOTO] Yeah, I'll
let you know when that happens!

375
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,625
Hahahaha!
Hey, you just made a joke!

376
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,166
[TSUKIMOTO] Are you really
having a good time here, Coach?

377
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:07,916
[KOIZUMI]
Here ya go.

378
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,041
This oughta settle
your stomach some.

379
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,125
God, I hope so. Thank you.

380
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,458
Hey, Coach?

381
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,666
[KOIZUMI]
Yeah, what's up?

382
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,250
[TSUKIMOTO] Can I get Butterfly
Jo to tell me his story?

383
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,375
Yeah, that's what they
used to call me back then.

384
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,166
They said I
played so gracefully,

385
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,125
I looked like a butterfly.

386
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,333
No one could touch me
'cause I was the only one

387
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,750
who could play both
forehand and backhand.

388
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,833
Made me invincible, they said.

389
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,458
I was so young then.

390
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,083
At the time,
folks were heralding me

391
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,750
as the rising star
of Japanese table tennis.

392
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,958
Everyone just took for
granted I'd represent Japan

393
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,000
at the world championships.

394
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,583
But then I lost
in the qualifier.

395
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,458
My opponent was this
guy I'd played with

396
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,083
for almost my whole life.

397
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,958
He was damn good too,
at least until...

398
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,083
...the doc told him
he'd torn a knee ligament

399
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,708
and it'd take six months
to fully recover.

400
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,958
[TSUKIMOTO] He didn't
withdraw from the competition?

401
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,125
[KOIZUMI]
I certainly would have.

402
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,333
But he wasn't me;

403
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:13,208
this guy simply
refused to give up.

404
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,500
He ignored all the voices

405
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,500
telling him not
to play that day.

406
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,000
Someone injured like that

407
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,583
y'coulda served
deep to the forehand,

408
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,833
then switched to
his backhand side.

409
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,250
Do ya think you
could've done that?

410
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,875
Rubbed salt in an
old friend's wound?

411
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:30,208
Used a strategy that might've
ended his career for good?

412
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,708
Could you really
have done that?

413
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,750
I made sure he
only had to focus

414
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,208
on his forehand side.

415
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,875
I self-destructed,

416
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:44,166
and I never played in
another big match again.

417
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,291
Meanwhile, the
public celebrated him

418
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:49,041
for toughing it out and
playing through his injury.

419
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,250
He rose through the
ranks to worldwide fame.

420
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:56,791
Now he's President of Kaio
Academy and oversees Poseidon.

421
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,791
Name's Ryu Kazama.

422
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,208
But I need to make one thing

423
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,333
perfectly clear to you, okay?

424
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,875
I'm not using you as some
kind of tool for revenge.

425
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,250
All I've ever wanted

426
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,291
is to show you where talent
like yours can take you.

427
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,958
And help to get you
to that place.

428
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,416
Yeah, I know.

429
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,625
I get it.

430
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,833
I do.

431
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:20,666
Goodness!

432
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,708
Goodness!

433
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,750
Is that really my Peco
making those drives?

434
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,500
And playing reverse-penhold
backhand, to boot?

435
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,291
Yup!

436
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,666
Back when he was younger,

437
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,791
he always made drives
with inverted rubber, right?

438
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,208
[TAMURA] Yeah 'cause
even at that age,

439
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,708
he was playin'
at the adult table.

440
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,416
When I remembered that
and had him try it,

441
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,625
he got it right away!

442
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,291
When he's facing
stronger opponents,

443
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,208
he tends to get pushed
away from the table,

444
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,375
so he'll be much better off

445
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,375
if he can add drives
to his arsenal!

446
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,708
Teachin' him RPB
was a bit of a last resort

447
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,750
since his backhand
wasn't improving,

448
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,250
but it just clicked for him!

449
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,750
I get what you
see in him now, Mom!

450
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,541
He's got talent!

451
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,791
Most players can't pull off

452
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,541
that kinda sudden switch
in style, but he can!

453
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,125
Peco's got this
sponge-like ability

454
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,833
to absorb new skills
and master 'em in no time!

455
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,291
That's a pretty
major renovation project.

456
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,833
Sure you won't
screw up the whole skyline

457
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,333
with all these changes?

458
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,708
Yeah.

459
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,458
His speed's still his
greatest advantage, I know!

460
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,208
He should play close.

461
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,041
There's gotta be a
style that's a better fit

462
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,166
for a guy like him.

463
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,500
I'll keep thinking.

464
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,458
Those are Peco's
brothers over there.

465
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,291
The kids all have the same face.

466
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,958
It's kinda creepy.

467
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,291
Their mom came to visit,

468
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,708
and damned if she doesn't
have the same face, too!

469
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,375
Now that Peco's living here,

470
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,875
a constant stream of relatives

471
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,541
have been dropping off
food and clothes for him.

472
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,666
[TAMURA] Well, I sure hope
the one practicing there

473
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,125
is the real Peco.

474
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,375
[MICHIO]
Huh?

475
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,666
[NATIONAL TRAINING
PLAYERS] One! Two! Three!

476
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,083
[counting continues]

477
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,125
[TAMURA]
It's heavy.

478
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,166
[MICHIO] Yeah.
It has two rubbers!

479
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,375
You oughta
swap the blade out

480
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,541
for a carbon one
that's under seventy grams.

481
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:50,666
You got it, Mom!

482
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,041
And what's goin'
on with that bandage

483
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,250
around his right knee?

484
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,541
It worries me.

485
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,750
He's wrapping
it 'cause he says

486
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,583
it's been feeling
a little off lately.

487
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,083
He swears
it's nothing serious,

488
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,875
but it's too soon to be sure.

489
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:03,416
Well, keep an eye on it,

490
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,958
and don't forget for a second.

491
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,000
He's still just a dumb teenager.

492
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,291
[MICHIO]
Got it!

493
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,583
[TAMURA]
All right, I'm off.

494
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,791
[MICHIO]
Thank you, Mom!

495
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,083
[TAMURA]
See ya later, Peco.

496
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,375
Keep working hard and do
what your coach tells you to.

497
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,750
What, you're leaving already?

498
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,375
You don't wanna stick around
and watch me some more?

499
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,000
[TAMURA]
Aw, dry those tears, kid.

500
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,375
I still love ya.

501
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,583
[HOSHINO]
Come on, Old Lady,

502
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,625
you can't toy with a
boy's heart like that!

503
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,625
These balls aren't
half-bad. Nice work.

504
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,458
Oh yeah?
I'm glad to hear it!

505
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,541
Honestly, I thought you'd
forgotten all about 'em.

506
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,625
Well, Coach is usually
the one in charge of equipment.

507
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,208
I wanna test these guys out.

508
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,416
Let's play a round.

509
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,791
Wouldn't you rather
play the old man?

510
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,500
I mean, I'm not
even dressed for it.

511
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,875
[TSUKIMOTO]
A casual game.

512
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,250
[TSUKIMOTO] They really do
feel completely different.

513
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,375
[OTA]
You think?

514
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,791
Much better.

515
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,333
Yeah, I guess so.

516
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,208
[TSUKIMOTO] I'm gonna
add a little spin now.

517
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,666
[OTA]
Go ahead!

518
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,666
[TSUKIMOTO]
These are great.

519
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,375
Huge improvement
over the old ones.

520
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,333
[TSUKIMOTO]
See?
