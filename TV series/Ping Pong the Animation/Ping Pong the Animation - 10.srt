You're going now?

[YURIE] No way, Dad,
you'll just cry if you do.

You should visit me!

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,250
Flying overseas is not for me.

[YURIE]
Mm...

No.

But Ryu will be fine.

19
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,291
No one's waited for a
hero longer than he has,

20

and all that waiting is
bound to pay off eventually.

In fact, I'm sure of it.

Someday, somebody
will come and save him.

When he wins,

[HOSHINO (CHILD)] I've traveled

Can you still
play on that knee?

34
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,750
[KAZAMA]
That's your paddle?

35
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,875
I ran up to
Don-Quijote to buy it

36
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,416
so I could have some
real fun with you, Dragon!

37
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,375
[MALE SPECTATOR 10A]
A twiddle penhold blade?

38
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,000
Never seen anyone use one!

39
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,458
[MALE SPECTATOR 10B] He's
gonna flip it during play?

40
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,541
The inverted rubber
should strengthen his returns

41
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:51,750
when he gets pushed back.

42
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,541
But we can't forget Peco's gift,

43
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,750
which is his speed attack
close to the table.

44
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,916
So I put one of his
springy, pips-out rubbers

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,541
back on one side.

46
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,875
And gave him a blade with
a twiddle penhold grip

47
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,583
to make twiddling easy.

48
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:08,500
Now he can choose pips-out for
speed, or inverted for spin,

49
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:12,500
and switch on the fly, for both
forehand and backhand strokes!

50
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,166
Constantly changing sides
will drive his opponent nuts

51
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,166
trying to guess what's
gonna come at him next.

52
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,500
Not an easy play style, but
Peco picked it up in no time!

53
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,458
[KAZAMA]
This is a toy.

You won't stand a chance
against me with this thing.

55
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,791
[HOSHINO] You're right
about my knee, you know.

56
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,916
It is messed up pretty bad.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,666
But as an athlete,
you're really high up there.

58
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,291
So I think I'll
take advantage of that.

climb on your back,

Sounds to me like you need
a strong dose of reality.

63

The way you're
talking is delusional.

00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,000
Look how fast I can move!

322
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,250
[MALE UMPIRE 10A]
Eleven-six.

323
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,166
Game to Hoshino!

324
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,708
[crowd cheering]

325
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,333
[KAZAMA]
Pips-in drive.

326
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,750
Pips-out backhand?

327
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,125
That's it.

328
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,291
[KAZAMA]
Pips-out again?

329
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,333
Good!

330
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:54,875
[MALE UMPIRE 10A]
Five all!

331
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,750
Yeah! Woo!

332
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,041
You see that?

333
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,500
This is what I call a match!

334
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,875
I can attack with either
rubber; it's awesome!

335
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,625
[crowd cheering]

336
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,333
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
This is a surprise.

337
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,458
[in Chinese]
He's got good instincts.

338
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,000
[in Chinese]
This must sting for Kazama.

339
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,833
[in Chinese]
Maybe not.

340
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,208
Hoshino's style is offbeat.

341
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,958
It's like he loves the sport
so much he can't hold it in.

342
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,958
Getting to play with
someone like that--

343
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,291
For me, at least, it's...

344
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,000
[HOSHINO]
Got him!

345
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,250
Tricky bastard.

346
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,708
When the hell'd he learn
how to chop like that?

347
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,625
Well, it worked.

348
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,333
He's got Kazama in panic mode.

349
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,750
[KAZAMA]
There are no heroes!

350
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,208
You can only rely
on your own strength!

351
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,833
[SAKUMA]
Their reactions are sick!

[MALE UMPIRE 10A]
Eleven-eight!

[crowd chering]

356
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,916
[in Chinese]
They're neck and neck now.

357
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,958
[in Chinese]
Yeah.

358
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,833
[SANADA]
Come on, Kazama!

359
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,125
By the way, don't
worry about my knee.

360
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:52,125
'Cause we're making this match
one for the record books.

361
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,166
Still love ya though, Dragon.

362
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,208
Mm-wa!

363
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,250
Don't push your luck.

364
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,208
[KAZAMA]
Yes!

365
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
[MALE UMPIRE 10A]
Out!

--[KAZAMA] Yeah!
--[TAKU] There you go!

367
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,583
[MALE UMPIRE 10A]
Five-six Kazama!

368
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,083
[in Chinese]
This is a good game.

369

[NORIO]
Here comes, Ryuichi!

370
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,166
That's great!

371
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,000
You're good at this, little guy!

372
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,750
Havin' fun?

373
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,500
You like playing this, buddy?

374
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,541
[SANADA]
Don't step back, Kazama!

375
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,125
[KAZAMA]
Shut up!

376
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,416
[SANADA]
I think he actually smiled.

377
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,833
[NEKOTA]
At what?

378
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,541
It's about time.

379
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,291
[KAZAMA] All of my cells
are singing out with joy.

380
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,666
"Faster," they command me.

381
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,458
"Faster! Faster!"

382
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,916
My concentration is a
force, shutting out the world.

383
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,333
As I speed up, reality
around me slows to a crawl.

384
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:24,291
Yet he keeps learning and
growing, like a sponge.

385
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,166
I explode into motion.

386
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,583
But I'm steadily
being outpaced.

387
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,666
I feel myself being left behind.

388
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,458
It's becoming obvious
who the better player is.

389
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,791
And yet, I don't feel anxious.

390
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,958
I'm striking with all I've got.

391
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,291
Reacting with all I am.

392
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,666
There's no time to be afraid.

393
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,666
Problem?

394
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,375
Not at all.

395
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,583
Truth is,

396
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,166
I feel really good.

397
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,166
Yeah.

398
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,291
Me, too.

399
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,458
So uh, this is match
point for me, Dragon.

400
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,708
[KAZAMA]
Yep.

401
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:19,166
This is as far as I go, hero.

402
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,125
[HOSHINO]
Seriously?

403
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:24,000
[KAZAMA] My wings
can't take any more.

404
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,625
Will you bring me
to this place again?

405
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,791
I get it now.

406
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:44,041
[KAZAMA] All of my cells
are singing out with joy.

407
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,666
"Faster," they command me.

408
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,125
"Faster! Faster!"

409
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,208
Reality around
me slows to a crawl.

410
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,958
Yet he keeps
learning and growing.

411
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:59,416
I'm being outpaced,
but I don't feel anxious.

412
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,708
There's no time to be afraid.

413
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,583
There's no need to be afraid!

414
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,375
I like this place.

415
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,041
It's glorious.

416
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,208
[HOSHINO]
You were so cool, Dragon.

417
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,083
[KAZAMA]
And you were right.

418
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,625
People can fly.

419
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,458
We can fly.
