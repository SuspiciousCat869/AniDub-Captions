for the championship

I want us to go in
there ready to dominate!

Take all four slots
again this year!

--Yeah!
--Yeah!

00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,291
Our bracket's full of
heavyweights like Kong

00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,458
from Tsujido.

8
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,083
Tsukimoto from Katase.

9
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,791
Guys even better than our
championship opponents!

00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,375
Do not let your guard down!

11
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,333
Understood?

12
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,875
[KAIO PLAYERS]
Yes sir!

13
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,125
Aw, yeah!
Cold noodles!

14
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,916
Spring has definitely sprung!

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,708
I never get tired of
eating at this place.

16
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,375
So many seasonal options!

17
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,750
Yeah, yeah, that's
great, Peco, really,

18
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,958
but how you plan
to graduate high school

19
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,583
when you're always here?

20
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,208
Ah, not a problem.

21
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:52,791
I calculated the number of
days I can skip and still pass.

22
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,083
You go to Katase, don'tcha?

23
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,458
[HOSHINO]
Mm-hmm.

24
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,583
[KOKUBU] You know a
chopper there named Tsukimoto?

25
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,125
I sure do.

26
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,625
Is he good?

27
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,375
Word is he's won
fifty games in a row.

28
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:05,791
Is that true?

29
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,416
Yeah sounds about right.

30
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,083
[KOKUBU] I got a little brother
who's on a high school team.

31
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:14,166
He had to play this
Tsukimoto kid one time.

32
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,666
Said his skills are sick.

33
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,291
Like superhuman good!

34
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,625
In fact, he was so tough,

35
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,916
he made my brother
consider quitting.

36
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,583
[KOKUBU] He said it was
like playing against a robot.

37
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:27,250
Whoa!

38
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,166
That's the Old Lady?

39
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,833
Damn, she used to be super-hot!

40
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,000
Hey, don't give
Peco any more beer!

41
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,250
I know we got some
juice around here!

42
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,250
So you knew that statue
you took a picture of

43
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,125
when you first got
here was Mom, right?

44
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,291
[HOSHINO]
Ooh, a ping-pong girl!

45
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,250
That's Mister Koizumi.

46
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,208
And there's
Kazama's grandfather.

47
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,041
Kaio's president.

48
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:47,875
[baby crying]

49
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,083
Whoa, you're right!

50
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,791
[MICHIO]
Aw, it's okay!

51
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,166
Upsy-daisy!

52
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,583
It's kind of a
small world, ain't it?

53
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,958
They were all
childhood friends.

54
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,166
Now eat something
and get to bed!

55
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,958
Oh, by the way,
Mom's pretty worried

56
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,208
about that knee
you got wrapped up.

57
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,208
Can't blame her.

58
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,458
You know, a knee injury

59
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,875
is what made her have
to give up competing.

60
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,333
You swear you're okay, though?

61
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,583
[HOSHINO]
Yup!

62
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,333
[MICHIO]
Well, don't sleep out here.

63
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,916
[YURIE] Jeez, you're
always in the bath.

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,416
I heard about Poseidon.

65
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,375
How they're providing mats
for the Tournament Qualifiers

66
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,583
to promote their new
mat-based products.

67
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,250
And your teammates are in on it.

68
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,083
They've got 'em all
wearing these special mat shoes

69
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,166
called "Dragons"
for some reason.

70
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,875
You should play
table tennis for yourself

71
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,666
and no one else.

72
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,458
I'm getting outta here.

73
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,083
And don't give me that face.

74
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,125
Huh, really?

75
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,541
I didn't realize Hoshino was
still playing table tennis.

76
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,791
Well, he is, and since you
didn't do your job with him,

77
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,583
I had to work twice as hard.

78
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,500
Sorry, no smoking in here.

79
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,916
All right.

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,291
I'll go ahead and register him
along with the other kids, then.

81
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,583
He's always been oddly popular
with the rest of the team.

82
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,000
Sure they won't mind.

83
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,166
Hell, they might even
throw him a parade.

Question for you, "madame".

85

Whaddya think're the odds that

could defeat Tsukimoto
if they face off

in the next championship?

88
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,375
Is it even possible?

You're the one who
already wrote him off.

90

[KOIZUMI] Maybe.
But you didn't answer me.

I dunno the odds.

You just can't compare
this kid to other players.

94
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,333
It's hard for me to say.

95
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,708
One thing I can
say is, talent-wise.

96
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,916
Hoshino's head and shoulders
above the Kazama kid.

00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,208
[TAMURA] He's in the
stadium with Koizumi.

162
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,458
S'too bad,

163
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,958
I was hoping I'd get a
chance to say hi to him!

[TAMURA]
The tournament board.

167
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,416
[MICHIO] Hmm.
Well in Round One,

168
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,125
he's got a first-year
who should be a cakewalk.

169
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,750
What? Spit it out.

170
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,083
Heads up, Peco!

171
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,458
Wanna know your
Round Two opponent?

172
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,958
Sure.

173
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,375
[MICHIO]

174

What's wrong, Wenge?

175
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,000
Eh...

Ah, you could say that.

to the second round?

181

But after him,
it's all gravy.

182
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,541
At least until the semifinal

183
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,125
where you'd be up
against Kazama!

184
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,500
How 'bout Smile?

185
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,083
If you play Smile, it won't
be 'til the final round.

186
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,875
He's got no one
standing in his way,

187
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,125
except maybe Sanada
in Round Three.

188
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,791
Nobody else even has a shot!

189
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,375
[HOSHINO]
Is Sanada good?

190
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,375
He's Kaio's number two guy.

191
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,750
Oh.

192
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,208
[HOSHINO] Well,
thanks for the info.

193
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,625
I'm gonna head down there now.

194
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,750
But why?

195
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,333
There's plenty time
before your match.

196
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,500
Yeah, I know.

197
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,625
Alright!

198
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,833
You go and show 'em
who's boss, then!

199
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,375
Make a name for yourself
out there, Peco!

200
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,791
Figured that might freak
him out at least a little,

201
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,166
but he seems to be taking
it all in stride, huh, Mom?

202
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,333
[TAMURA] Nobody gets to the top
without slaying a few monsters.

203
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,000
Guess he must've
prepared himself for it.

204
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,083
Dammit, this totally blows.

205
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,500
Seriously?

206
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,916
Kill me now.

[pouting]

208

[in Chinese]
You might not believe this,

209
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,875
but my team is
getting pretty good.

210
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,666
It was like teaching
babies to read and write

211
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,875
from scratch.

212
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,958
Today's singles
matches may be rough,

213
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:06,166
but they'll go far
in the team events.

214
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,208
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
I'll look forward to it.

215
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,833
[KONG, in Chinese]
It's true.

[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
I trust you, Wenge.

217

Is the strongest one
still that Ryuichi Kazama?

218

[KONG, in Chinese]
Yeah.

219
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,583
But there's a threat
to him this year.

220
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:26,583
You remember
Makoto Tsukimoto, Coach?

221

[in Chinese]
Ah, the one with the glasses!

222
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,250
[KONG, in Chinese]
It's sure to be a good fight.

223
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,791
I'm not up against them
until the semifinals.

224
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:39,000
It's the Best Four, then the
national championships for me.

225
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,833
[CHINESE COACH, in Chinese]
I look forward to that.

226
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:45,250
[in Chinese] I want to
beat Kazama just once,

227
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,833
and earn my ticket home.

228
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:48,708
[in Chinese]
Nice.

229
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,958
I'm sure you can do it.

230
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,208
[SANADA] Wait, you're not
wearing the mat shoes?

No.

232

The shoes don't make
any difference to me.

233

It's gonna look pretty
dumb if we all go out there

wearin' these things and the guy
who they're named after doesn't.

235
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,875
I've been wearing
Butterfly shoes

236
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,458
since my days in China
and they work just fine.

237
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,291
We wear the same ones whether
on mats or bare floors.

238
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,666
[KOEDA]
No, really?

239
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,208
We bought these!

240
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,250
Well, good shoes are good
shoes, and that's important.

241
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,333
So it's not a total loss.

[PLAYER 8BB]
Whoa, look!

the mat shoes!

Kazama isn't?

246
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,125
So you're not stressing
out about the mats?

247
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:45,833
No.

Why would I be?

249
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,208
But more importantly, Coach,

250
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,166
you don't have any
strategic advice?

No sir-ee, none at all.

I'm just no match for that guy.

Guess this is what
world-class play is like.

It figures I'd finally
make first string at Kaio

272

only to have this
be my debut match-up.

Nah.

The only reason I probably even
made the cut in the first place

277
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,750
was because Kaio's
not what it used to be.

I don't think anyone

Higashi from Minami High!

Yeah? So what, you dope,
that's nothing.

00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,833
He's phenomenal at everything.

320
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:48,500
Ryuichi?

321
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,250
Huh?

322
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,416
Sorry.

323
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
What's the matter?

324
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,750
Table Twelve.

325
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,083
Ah, Kong Wenge.

326
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,625
That's right.

327
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,958
Well watch 'im closely;

328
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,083
you'll definitely be going
up against him later.

329
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,541
I'm not so sure.

330
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,250
Check it.

331
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,166
He's gonna lose the first game.

332
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,000
[MALE UMPIRE 8C]
Out!

333
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,208
Ten-seven, Hoshino.

334
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,083
[KONG, in Chinese]
Shit!

335
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,166
[in Chinese]
Wenge...

336
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,958
Who the hell
is this Hoshino kid?

337
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,333
[KAZAMA]
No idea.

338
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,500
Yeah, Kong's gotta be

339
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,041
gettin' sweaty in
the britches about now.

340
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,583
After all, this is a kid
he managed to skunk

341
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,250
just over a year ago.

342
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,333
[KONG, in Chinese]
Is this really the same guy

343
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,708
from last year?

344
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,291
He's completely different.

345
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,083
That guy didn't have drives.

346
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,583
Is he someone else?

347
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,375
He's fast!

348
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,416
Ugh!

349
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:37,541
No!

350
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,625
It's him!

351
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,875
He hasn't overcome
his weak backhand side.

352
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,791
Why no RPB shots, then?

353
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,500
Isn't that what
the rubber is for?

354
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,458
Doesn't he have any?

355
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,791
Doesn't he?

356
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:51,708
[in Chinese]
He doesn't really have

357
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:52,916
a backhand, Wenge!

358
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,791
Don't let the racket fool you!

359
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:58,208
He hasn't mastered
the RPB style yet!

360
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,458
[KONG, in Chinese]
I see!

361
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,375
Ni hao!

362
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,750
[KONG, in Chinese]
I see now!

363
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,666
[TAMURA]
There it is.

364
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,458
[MALE UMPIRE 8C]
Eleven-eight.

365
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,375
Game goes to Hoshino!

366
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,083
[MALE SPECTATOR 8E] He actually
took a game from Kong?

367
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,541
[MALE SPECTATOR 8F] That
penholder's using both sides!

368
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,541
[NEKOTA] Go over all the
data we have on this Hoshino.

369
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,208
[MOURI] His backhand was
almost like a forehand.

370
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,791
What is he doing?

371
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,583
I specifically told him to try
that on someone weaker first!

372
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:32,458
Son.

373
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,666
Bluffs are their most effective

374
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,541
when used against
the best players.

375
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,291
You know this.

376
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,666
Love ya, Peco!

377
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,458
Yeah!

378
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,083
Hey, you there!

379
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,791
Uh, you're in the middle of a
match here, Tsukimoto!

380
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:47,958
[TSUKIMOTO]
Right.

381
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,333
Sorry about that.

382
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,625
Welcome back, hero.

383
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,083
Nice one.

384
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,625
Well, well.

385
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,750
[MICHIO] He just learned both
the Chiquita and the Miuta!

386
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,416
[TAMURA] That kid is
something else, huh? 

387
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,916
He's growing.
Right before our eyes.

388
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,333
This is all just
one big game to him.

389
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,041
See?

390
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,541
He bowls people over.

391
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,708
Whatever it takes
to get to the top.

392
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,750
Honestly, it's
almost frightening.

393
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,000
The most likely
explanation is Kong panicked

394
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,708
and it threw him off his game.

395
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,125
Yeah. But...

396
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,583
Yeah!

397
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,750
[MALE UMPIRE 8C]
Nine-six.

398
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,166
Hoshino leads.

399
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,041
[crowd cheering]

400
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,333
[KONG] Hey, do you remember
how when you first played me,

401
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,958
you couldn't score
even a single point?

402
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,750
You've come a long way.

403
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,083
[HOSHINO] I owe you
a big xie xie, Kong.

404
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,375
Thanks to you crushing me,
I pushed myself to get stronger.

405
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,541
I guess in a way,

406
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,916
it was you who finally
taught me how to fly.

407
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:09,958
[KAZAMA]
Huh.

408
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,250
Real talent.

409
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,125
What're you doin'
here, Mister Tsukimoto?

410
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,625
Done already?

411
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,458
Yeah.

412
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,333
Well, that sure was fast.

413
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,208
[TSUKIMOTO] You mean
you weren't watching me?

414
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,291
[KOIZUMI]
Course not.

415
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,375
I knew you'd win this round.

416
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,208
[TSUKIMOTO]
But I lost.

Huh?!

418
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,291
[TSUKIMOTO]
Just kidding.

419
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,750
Hoshino?

420
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,958
Yeah.

421
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,583
Your pal's playing a
pretty interesting game.

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,458
[KOIZUMI] What, you're not
gonna watch the rest of this?

424
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,458
[TSUKIMOTO] Course not,
I know he'll win this round.

425

Ten-seven.

00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,750
Hoshino.

428
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,416
[TAKU]
He's tightening the noose.

429
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,750
[KAZAMA]
Yeah, he is.

430
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,166
[TAMURA]
Atta boy.

431
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,666
[KONG, in Chinese] I wish I'd
at least gotten myself

432
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,291
stuck in Europe.

433
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,708
Sweden or Germany
or someplace.

434
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,541
It's the Best Four,

435
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,333
then the national
championships for me.

436

Got your ticket, Wenge?

[KONG'S MOTHER, in Chinese] I'm
waiting for your return, Wenge.
