way the world works.

162
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,000
Some of the most gifted people

163
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,958
are so comfortable with who
they are they don't care about

164
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,458
achievements. They've
got nothing to prove.

165
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,083
I'm not trying to
force this on him.

166
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,583
He can make his own choice.

167
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,041
But how can he make
a real decision

168
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,166
until he understands
what the options are?

169
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,500
I just want to give him a chance

170
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,416
to see the view at the
top of the mountain first.

171
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
And I think once he does,

172
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,500
something inside him
is gonna change.

173

[TAMURA]
You sure about that?

174
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,500
Bullying Tsukimoto won't bring
back your youth, you know.

175
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,375
You can't rewrite the past.

176
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Good work.

Thank you, sir.

Wait a sec, where's Kazama?

00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,041
[TAKU]
He's off in the can.

180
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,333
Again.

181
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,791
[SAKUMA] Why, is he
constipated or something?

182
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:49,416
[TAKU]
No.

183
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,833
Nothin' like that.

184
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,583
He does this before every match.

[toilet flushes]

187
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,583
It's about time
we got to a boss fight.

188
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,208
I hear he's won
sixty-eight in a row.

189

The guy really
is a monster, isn't he?

190
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,708
I heard at Kaio

191
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,250
if you lose before
the fourth round,

192
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,750
they kick you off the team.

No way, seriously?

That's freaking harsh.

[MALE PLAYER 4A] Table tennis
is their whole life.

They're obsessed.

[MALE PLAYER 4B]
It's kind of scary, actually.

[MALE PLAYER 4A]
Check out Kazama.

199
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,291
He's got a look in his
eyes like he killed a man.

200
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,000
And who knows, maybe he has.

201
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,000
If that news came out,
I wouldn't be shocked.

He's gonna hear you,

Just look at him,

tell me how he's
still in high school.

Dude's gotta be
thirty years old, minimum.

Now on Court Eight,
the quarterfinal match

of this little
island country.

Look at those muscles.

He's got power, but I doubt
he's light on his feet.

218
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,541
Make a good serve,

219
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,458
then do a
third ball attack.

Kaio Academy was founded by

so you won't find a school more
passionate about the sport.

All of our practices are filmed
in HD and analyzed by computer.

We have state-of-the-art
machines that can replicate

almost any shot, and
others to collect the balls.

We restock every
three or four days.

302

You have your choice
of the best new rubbers

from a mountain of options,
so they're pristine

You'll have a
personalized weight training

and cardio program, too.

309
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,958
The trainers in our gym employ
the latest sports science

to understand and keep
your body in top shape.

311
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,958
All meals are
supervised by nutritionists.

312
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,958
And I'm still only
scratching the surface.

313
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,791
Have you ever
wanted to play overseas?

314
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,833
The staff is looking out
for our long-term futures.

315
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,041
There's a full library
where you can find coverage

316
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,708
of every major
international competition.

317
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:36,000
And if you ask, someone'll
go record any match you want,

318
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,041
anywhere in the world.

319
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,166
You can't reach Nationals alone,

320
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,166
much less the world stage.

321
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,583
But you have talent, Tsukimoto.

322
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,708
Katase isn't worthy of you.

323
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,791
You belong with us at Kaio.

324
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,250
I'll come pick ya up one day.

325
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,416
When you're ready.

326
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,375
Yeah, good luck
at the championships.

327
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,875
Where the hell is Kazama?

328
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,416
Guy definitely takes his
sweet time in the can.

329
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,083
All your play was sloppy!

330
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,583
That's unacceptable!

331
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,708
You clowns think you're so
good you can pull your punches

332
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,500
against inferior players?

333
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,208
Well at Nationals, you
boys're gonna be screwed!

334
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,250
--Sir!
--Sir!

335
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,458
[TAKU]
When we get back to the gym,

336
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,583
I want everyone to
show me you're serious.

337
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,791
Understood?

338
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:23,708
[KAIO PLAYERS]
Yes sir!

339
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,083
[TAKU]
Dismissed!

340
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,166
[TAKU]
Yurie!

341
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,875
You're only now getting here?

342
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,416
Ah well, Ryuichi,
you ride back with her.

343
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,958
[KAZAMA]
Yes, sir.

344
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,666
[KAIO PLAYER 4A]
Is that Coach's daughter?

345
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,291
[KAIO PLAYER 4B]
She's hot.

346
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,333
[KAIO PLAYER 4C] Yeah, have you
seen her in those commercials?

347
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,208
[KAIO PLAYER 4B]
Kazama's one lucky dog.

348
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,458
[KAIO PLAYER 4D] Yeah,
I hear he lives with her

349
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,625
at the President's house.

350
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,250
He actually has a life.

351
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,916
[SANADA]
It isn't right.

352
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,375
[TAKU]
Those two are cousins!

353
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,208
Their relationship is platonic.

354
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,458
[KAIO PLAYER 4B]
No way I'm buying that.

355
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,083
[KAIO PLAYER 4A]
Dads are totally blind.

356
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,750
[TAKU]
You'll pay for that in laps!

357
00:20:58,833 --> 00:20:59,750
Get on the bus!

358
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:00,791
[KAIO PLAYERS]
Yes sir!

359
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,791
[announcement bell]

360
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,291
[MALE STAFF 4A] Attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

361
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,000
All of today's
matches have ended,

362
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,166
concluding this year's
qualifying round.

363
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,958
Thank you again for attending,

364
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,666
and we look forward
to seeing you next time.

365
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,833
The building will
close promptly at six.

366
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,625
We ask that you exit
in a timely manner.

367
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,708
We apologize
for any inconvenience.
