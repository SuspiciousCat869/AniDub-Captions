[MRS. KOIZUMI]
Tsukimoto?

2
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,250
It is Tsukimoto, isn't it?

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,208
Are you here to pay my
husband a get-well visit?

4
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,875
Oh, how thoughtful.

5
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,666
They say he
overworked his muscles.

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,583
I think he forgets
he's over seventy now!

7
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,833
Come on inside.

8
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,166
I'm sure he'll be
just thrilled to see you.

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,000
Uh, no, that's okay.

10
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,750
As long as he's all right,
then I think I'm just gonna go.

11
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,833
[MRS. KOIZUMI] Nonsense!
I'm making dinner. Join us.

12
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,708
[TSUKIMOTO] Thanks, but I
don't really like eating

13
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,208
at other people's houses.

14
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,833
Ah. Perfectly understandable.

15
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,291
Poor boy, you must
have it so rough

16
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,791
with that old man always
giving you such a hard time.

17
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:54,791
Yeah.

18
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,500
He can be a real
pain in the rear.

19
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,875
Well you're not big
on tact, that's for sure.

20
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,416
Sorry.

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,041
No, it's refreshing.

22
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,083
Come see us again
sometime, will ya?

23
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,125
All right. I will.

24
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,666
Look forward to it!

25
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,375
He's adorable.

26
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,333
And such clear eyes.

27
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:21,125
Well that boy's gonna
become a monster before long.

28
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,666
He's about ready to
burst out of his cocoon.

29
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,958
Just needs a hard-ass
old Ping-Pong coach

30
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,750
to give him a
little push, is all.

31
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,416
[KAIO PRESIDENT] I'm counting on
you to lead us to victory again,

32

Ryuichi.

33
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,291
For in triumph, we find truth.

34
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,541
Your school needs
you to prevail,

35

to demonstrate to the world
this institution's supreme

37
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,541
[KAZAMA]
Yes, sir!

38
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,541
Though I have some concerns
about the team competition.

39
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,041
[KAIO PRESIDENT]
Whatever it takes, son;

40
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,833
patch any gaps
in our arsenal!

41
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:57,458
[KAZAMA] I do have my eye on
a chopper from Katase High.

[KAIO PRESIDENT]
Katase?

43
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,458
One of Koizumi's, huh?

44
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,791
And this chopper's that good?

45
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,375
I don't know yet, sir.

46
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,750
[KAIO PRESIDENT]
If he is, recruit him.

47
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,083
I trust you and Taku
can handle this.

48
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,083
[KAZAMA]
Yes, sir!

49
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,166
Any compromise

50
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,250
is like cutting
off your own arm.

51
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,750
Remember, if we lose,
it's entirely on you.

52
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:15,791
Yes, sir!

53
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,208
Yeah!

54
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,833
Come back in
three hundred years.

55
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,958
Maybe then you can beat me.

56
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,166
So Koizumi's
working with Smile, eh?

57
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,166
Huh.

58
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,666
I do not like that.
Not a bit.

Whoa, check out their heads.

[in Chinese]
Heh, you could say that.

68
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,500
[HOSHINO] So, how's
your bracket looking?

69
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,625
[TSUKIMOTO]
Sucky.

70
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,958
I've got Kong Wenge
in my third match.

71
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:53,958
Oh, man.

72

Meh, I got a

in the quarterfinals.

76
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,625
but if I can beat him,

77

then I'm in the top four
and off to nationals.

78

better than any of us

161
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,750
the agony that can come
from failing at table tennis.

162
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,083
His whole life was upended

163
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,708
when he was dropped from
the Chinese National Team.

164
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,791
Bet havin' to play here
on our little island

165
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,333
is the last thing he wants
to be doin' right now.

166
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,958
At least if he conquers Japan,

167
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,458
he'll have a shot at a
comeback in his home country.

168
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,833
But if he loses,
forget about China.

169
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,666
He probably won't even be
able to stick around here.

170
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,750
Which means his career
is pretty much over.

171

Been meanin' to tell ya.

172
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,375
I don't like the way
you play the game.

173
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,583
Your technique is
flawless, I admit.

174
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,583
However, it absolutely
disgusts me how you always take

175
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,250
your opponent's
feelings into account.

176
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,166
That there tells me you're
not fit to hold a paddle.

177
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,958
Makes me physically sick.

178
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,041
Well, I can't say
it feels great

179

to be crapped on so bluntly.

180

Poor guy.

187

Hey, I need you
to listen for a sec.

188
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,000
You have to promise me

00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,541
that you're not gonna
hold back in there.

190
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,250
It's a bad habit you've got.

191
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,625
Don't worry, sir, I plan to win.

192
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,083
No holding back.

193
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,000
So how much should I win by?

194
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,166
Two points? Ten?

[TSUKIMOTO]
Oh, I know.

198
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,916
Since Kong won his
match in ten minutes,

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,166
how about I
get it done in five?

200
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,458
What's gotten into you, son?

wanna win, is all.

Oh, no.

Music to my ears.

205
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,583
[SAKUMA] Dude, that
was pretty harsh of you

206
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,166
with Tsukimoto back there.

207
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,708
Now, don't get me wrong,
I think it'll do him some good.

208
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,041
He's always been
a stuck-up little--

this dude pretty well.

Any ideas on how to
get him to join our team?

Never heard of him.

[EGAMI] Well, this
is my last tournament.

Hope third time's the charm.

[EGAMI] Man, I really
wanna make it to Nationals.

231
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,041
He's a chopper, so I guess
I'll serve short to his fore

232
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,125
to check out
his defensive skills.

233
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,541
If his return is weak,

234
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,791
I'll send a third ball attack
to the back and then...

235
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,166
Ah, I'll figure it out.

an offensive game?

Think he's gonna
stay so close to the table?

Is he conserving energy?

Does he think I'm weak?

243
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,708
That he can wrap this up quick
without bothering to chop?

And a little hurt.

246
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,875
But his rubber's not
designed for offense.

Are you kiddin' me?

252
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,708
This isn't table tennis.

always be so cruel?

Oh well, at least I stuck with
this longer than most things.

What crawled up your butt?

Peco, do you believe in heroes?

Like if you're in real trouble,

along and save you?

It's a bad habit to get in.

[KOIZUMI]
Play him with this racket.

Um, Coach, this one
has long pips-out.

Oh, really?

like the feeling, actually.

[KAZAMA]
Huh?

Can't help notice, you're
interested in Tsukimoto.

But why?

354
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,791
The answer to that one's
a little complicated.

355
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,833
Turns out, talent is a gift
that doesn't always wind up

Alright, Kong?

Because I don't suck.

Yes!

Blame your environment.

You have no rival,
no master, no pressure!

You'll rust in this
hothouse you live in.

Just like an old bike

Game goes to Kong!

So even our ace

against the Chinese.
