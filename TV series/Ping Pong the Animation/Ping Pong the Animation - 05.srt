spare you all that future pain.

Well, I'd feel ashamed

to show my
face there, anyway.

up that weak little club,

wasn't the real goal.

The one saving grace is that

Can I get a quote, Dragon?

in the team and doubles events.

But I'm satisfied with my
win in the singles, at least.

Above all, I'm worried.

My school means more
to me than anything else.

Let's face it.

The last few years, the
collective strength of our team

to be like a fortress.

And if we're going to
be that fortress again,

for their free-wheeling
management style.

186
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,333
And that "black pop"
commercial was pure genius.

of their orange cream.

reinventing themselves

I don't see Smile anywhere.

He's gotta have three
times the energy we do.

That's why he's playin'
in so many matches.

Nobody on our team's good
enough to practice against.

222
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,625
That means the rest of us have
to play schools at his level,

No sir.

He said he was coming
down with a cold,

He's the type who'd play
right through appendicitis.

who killed himself
for winnin' bronze.

247
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,250
So what would
be important enough

248
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,416
to make him skip practice?

Let's just say
if an art gallery

303
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,541
were doing an
"awkwardness" exhibit,

304
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,166
this kid'd be on a pedestal.

305
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,791
I didn't scout him at all.

306

him being on the team

only end in suffering.

315
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,916
If you tell him to
drop and give you twenty,

Go on!

Tell me where to freaking look!
