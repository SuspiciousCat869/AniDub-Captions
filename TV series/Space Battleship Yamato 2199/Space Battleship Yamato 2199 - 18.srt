1
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:53,687
[NANBU]
So Balun's on the other side?

2
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,731
That's what you were calling a
"lighthouse in space," right?

3
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:57,649
[OTA]
That's right.

4
00:01:57,732 --> 00:01:59,359
[SHIMA]
We're surprised, too.

5
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:00,652
We had no idea it was the hub

6
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:03,363
of a whole subspace
gate network.

7
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:04,823
But that's great--
we can jump to

8
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:07,075
the Large Magellanic
without issue!

9
00:02:07,158 --> 00:02:08,535
Sure, if we're lucky.

10
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:10,954
The enemy controls
this network, remember?

11
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:12,580
Yeah, I know.

12
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:15,166
Well, I'd say Misaki
was the bigger surprise.

13
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,211
Who knew Iscandarians
could possess people?

14
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:22,465
It's crazy. Do you think
she'll ever go back to normal?

15
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:26,177
[SANADA]
The gate's back online.

16
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:28,096
And with her help,
we've learned how to use

17
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:29,931
the control system
from our ship.

18
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:31,808
Mm.

19
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:34,227
We appreciate you assisting us.

20
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:37,564
[MISAKI]
Show gratitude with action.

21
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,858
Not with your words.

22
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:42,736
[SANADA] We're loading
a simplified version of

23
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:44,738
the control program
onto a Gamilan fighter

24
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:47,365
we recovered from the satellite.

25
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:50,201
Scouting Balun will be
a dangerous assignment.

26
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:52,537
Who are you planning
to send as the pilot?

27
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,665
Well, the Fighter Squad
Captain will choose.

28
00:02:55,749 --> 00:02:58,209
I'll notify you as soon
as it's been decided.

29
00:02:58,293 --> 00:03:00,587
[OKITA]
Mmm.

30
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,005
[KOBASHI]
I wish he'd picked me.

31
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:03,798
[FIGHTER SQUAD 15B] Yeah, yeah,
you just want the glory.

32
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:05,633
[FIGHTER SQUAD 18A]
Come back in one piece, buddy.

33
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:07,135
All right, that's enough!

34
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:09,804
I've made my decision.
Now clear out!

35
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:11,681
--Guess I'll see ya.
--[DAIKUHARA] Good luck.

36
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:12,932
Don't screw up.

37
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:15,060
Back to your stations,
you gossipy imbeciles!

38
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:17,187
--[SAWAMURA] All right! Jeez.
--[KOBASHI] We're going.

39
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,564
--Shinohara.
--Yes, sir.

40
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:22,233
Try to relax, would ya?

41
00:03:24,694 --> 00:03:26,363
[chuckles]

42
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:39,167
[YAMAMOTO]
I'm surprised.

43
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,338
Volunteering for work
doesn't seem like your style.

44
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:46,257
Why now? Why <i>this</i> mission?

45
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:50,804
[SHINOHARA] A long time ago,
back when I was still

46
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:54,516
in flight school, I saw one
of our planes passing over,

47
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,893
and it was a spectacular sight.

48
00:03:57,977 --> 00:04:00,146
Hard to put into words, really.

49
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,233
Just something about the way
it cut across the sky.

50
00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:06,695
Noble and strong.
And when I saw it I thought,

51
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:10,824
"There. That's the most
beautiful thing in the world."

52
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:16,913
Later someone I.D.'d it for me.
It was a recon plane.

53
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:20,166
You know, I actually wanted
to be in recon myself.

54
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,085
Uh.

55
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:35,557
Listen to me, Shinohara.

56
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,852
The first rule of reacon
is that you have to return.

57
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:42,313
So make sure you
come back to us. Got it?

58
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:49,112
[COMM OFFICER 18A]

Three, two, one.

66
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:13,345
[MONK] We've arrived
at Balun on schedule.

67
00:05:13,428 --> 00:05:14,637
[BRIDGE OFFICER 10E]
The Goergametsch is requesting

68
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:16,389
permission to dock, sir.

69
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:18,767
That must be Goer.

70
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,810
Yes, right on cue.

71
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:25,523
Inspector-General,
thank you for gracing us

72
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:27,567
with your presence
all the way out here.

73
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,528
I mean the sheer honor of
this-this huge naval review

74
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:33,907
at Balun is indescribable
for all of us stationed here.

75
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,034
And of course as acting
commander I can't help

76
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:37,744
but feel especially proud.

77
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:40,038
The sight of so many ships
here fulfills a dream

78
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:41,998
I've long held
for this vital theater--

79
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:44,793
The Empire is in greater
peril now than ever before.

80
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:47,420
Treasonous forces
are trying to divide us.

81
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:50,548
And so it falls on me
to bring us back together!

82
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:53,760
I will save the glory
of our people!

83
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:56,388
[grunts]

84
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:57,764
Three hours?

85
00:05:57,847 --> 00:05:59,224
That's right.

86
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:01,351
[YAMAMOTO] He's supposed
to recon the area and locate

87
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:04,270
the Magellanic gate
all in three hours?

88
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:11,569
[KATO]
He's agreed to the stakes.

89
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:13,697
[YAMAMOTO]
And what does that mean?

90
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:17,617
[KATO]
It's an enemy network.

91
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:19,411
We could be leading them
straight to us.

92
00:06:19,494 --> 00:06:22,414
If we can't use the gate,
we need to get out fast.

93
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:24,332
So what, when that
stupid clock runs out

94
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,710
we're just gonna leave
whether he's back or not?

00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:04,289
[MORI] Sword Three's
physical signal lost.

102
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:06,833
It's no longer
in normal space, sir.

103

if we can use the gate.

104
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:11,588
Yes, sir.

105
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:14,299
[OKITA] When time's up,
we evacuate immediately.

106
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:17,093
If Sword Three isn't back
by then, we leave him behind.

107
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:19,929
I need you all to
come to terms with that.

108
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:35,737
[SHINOHARA] This subspace
business is pretty crazy.

110
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,078

00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:47,415
[SHINOHARA] Guess the radar's
not gonna help.

113
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:52,087
That limits my options.
I can only rely on this.

114
00:07:55,215 --> 00:07:56,716
[YAMAMOTO]
And that call sign?

115
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,886
He picked it out himself.

116
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:02,889
I guess it's his way
of paying tribute.

117
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:07,477
"Sword Three" is an old
call sign we used in the 343rd.

118
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,729
I never thought
I'd hear it out here.

119
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:13,108
[YAMAMOTO] You always said
the first rule of reacon

120
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:14,859
is you have to return.

any permanent damage,

are surprisingly minor

is functional.
