just like this.

161
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,375
Do you have films?

162
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,833
Does Gamilas have any laws
about POW treatment?

163
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,750
We treat all who
surrender to the Empire

164
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,625
with perfect fairness
and civility.

165
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,083
Those who refuse to
surrender, we annihilate.

166
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,708
So that's why you've been trying
to destroy our planet, huh?

167
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:23,208
Because we dare to fight back?!

168
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,375
And yet...

169
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,583
...we did manage
to work together.

170
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,791
That's gotta mean something.

171
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,083
[MELDA] It means we don't
break our promises.

172
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,333
[KODAI]
Neither do we.

00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,375
[gasps]

174
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,416
Call me crazy,

175
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,708
but I'm getting this feeling
that we can trust each other.

176
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,875
My XO would probably
call that illogical,

177
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,291
but sometimes you
gotta go with your gut.

178
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,458
[ITO]
He calls that interrogation?

179
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,708
Looks to me like he's trying
to establish trust, sir.

180
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,458
Well, all I'm saying is I hope
he doesn't get any cozier

181
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,625
than he has to.

182
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,833
[HOSHINA]
Huh?

183
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:00,416
Our Chief of Tactical
is a man, after all.

184
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,833
[ITO] "Establishing trust"
with an alien.

185
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,125
That's a naïve fantasy.

186
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,958
Once the <i>Yamato</i> gets out
of the Milky Way galaxy,

187
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,166
we'll be navigating
toward the planet Balun.

188
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,625
It's a halfway point between us
and the Large Magellanic Cloud.

189
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,291
Sort of a lighthouse
in space to show the way.

190
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,625
So, Lieutenant.

191
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,625
I've never heard of Balun
before, did H.Q. name it

192
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,250
while drawing up
the Yamato Plan?

193
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,791
No, it's not from us.

194
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,791
Apparently it was in the plans
Yurisha gave us a year ago.

195
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,375
Yamazaki.

196
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,000
Lieutenant Shima.

197
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,708
Sorry, but may we have
a word in private?

198
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,250
[gasps] Okay.

[YAMAMOTO panting]

You're working hard.

203
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,458
Only way to get stronger.

204
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,958
True. But pushing yourself
too hard can be bad, ya know?

205
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,125
What are you talking about?

206
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,291
No offense, but I think
you're taking this situation

207
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,250
a little too personally.

208
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,833
Oh, I know what'll
cheer you up.

209
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,916
So, what is it you
wanted to talk about?

210
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,375
[YAMAZAKI]
Look,

211
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,375
I was on board the ship your
father captained that day.

212
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,500
[gasps]

213
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,375
Command issued a gag order.

214
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,791
I'm strictly forbidden to ever
discuss what happened.

215
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:46,000
I've kept quiet
all these years.

216
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,250
But no more.

[gasps]

218
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,750
[SERIZAWA]
We dispatched a military envoy

219
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,291
and attempted peaceful contact.

220
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,541
But the aliens chose
to ignore our overtures

221
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,625
and fired on us without warning.

222
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,083
The UN Space Defense Committee

223
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,916
had no choice but to
take this aggression

224
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,250
as a clear act of war
against planet Earth.

225
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,500
In response, we issued
an emergency order

226
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,583
to defend our system...

227
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,333
[SERIZAWA]
Open fire, Okita!

228
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,250
[OKITA] It's our first contact
with an alien civilization.

229
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,250
We can't jump to conclusions!

230
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,666
[SERIZAWA] This is Central
Command's decision!

231
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,875
If we don't act decisively
it could be too late.

232
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,291
That's nonsense!

Incoming message
from the Murasame.

"We have encountered alien
vessels. Please advise."

235
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,541
We don't have time
to debate this

236
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,458
and it's clear you won't obey.

237
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,583
By my authority as
Military Director,

238
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,291
I hereby remove
you from command!

[gasps]

240
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,750
[SERIZAWA] This is General
Serizawa from Central Command.

241
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,833
The Murasame is instructed
to immediately open fire

242
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,666
on the alien vessels.

243
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,250
But, sir! Admiral Okita--

244
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,791
[SERIZAWA]
Has been removed from command.

00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,375
You have your orders, Captain!

246
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,208
[YAMAZAKI]
And so, we did as we were told.

247
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,875
We opened fire first
on the Gamilan ships.

You sure, Captain?

This ship is too far gone
to survive. Go, Chief.

Admiral Owen,
manage the evacuation.

But, Captain...

Forging a friendship with
the aliens is possible.

I made that promise to my son.

259
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,750
Instead, we've chosen war.

She'll never give information

Truth is,

320
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:35,375
I don't have any memories
beyond this last year.

321
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,125
There's a good chance my
family's dead already,

322
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,375
I just can't remember
who they were,

323
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,791
or what they meant to me.

324
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,916
It's all just empty space.

325
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,125
Then you're right, you can't
possibly understand.

[SANADA]
Based on our analysis,

328
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,750
this system shows strong
signs of enemy activity.

329
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,833
It's highly probable
there's a Gamilan base

330
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,125
on one of these planets
very close to our route.

331
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,791
We've already charted a detour
to keep our distance.

No. We'll maintain our course.

[gasps]

I have to object!

339
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,625
What if she's been spying on us?

Shima...

341
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,833
My decision stands, Lieutenant.

342
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,416
How can you trust that demon
when she lied to our faces,

343
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,083
and said we attacked them first?

344
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,791
Would you relax?
This isn't like you.

345
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,041
They killed your brother
like they killed my father!

346
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,125
Don't tell me you trust her

347
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,041
just because she helped
us out one time!

Melda Ditz.

How could she have escaped?

[AIHARA] Wait, did someone
issue a pursuit order?

just launched, too!

I repeat. Falcon, do you copy?

You're kidding, right?

00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,375
I'm not. And by the way,
she'll be leaving us soon.

I'm sorry, Yuki.

Your punishment is six

did you think I would abandon
her and try to escape?

No, I thought we could
trust in your honor.

And I was right.
