[OTA] Ladies and gentlemen:
Planet Iscandar.

5
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:56,124
An Earth-type world.
Surface: 80% water.

6
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:58,043
Despite all we
were up against...

7
00:02:58,126 --> 00:02:59,836
...we made it.

8
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,004
Yeah.

00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:13,683
[OKITA] Crew of the <i>Yamato</i> ,
this is Captain Okita.

10
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:17,354
We have finally
reached Iscandar.

11
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:22,150
Take a good, long look.
Our destination lies before us.

12
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:25,153
As your Captain, I have just
one thing I'd like to say,

13
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:28,156
to each and every one of you.

14
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,284
I'm grateful. That is all.

15
00:03:36,664 --> 00:03:39,334
[MORI] Iscandar's landing system
will now guide the <i>Yamato</i>

16
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:41,211
to the planet's surface.

17
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:42,587
At touch-down coordinates,

18
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:44,881
surface temperature
is 27 degrees.

19
00:03:44,964 --> 00:03:47,967
Air pressure:
1,023 hectopascals.

20
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:51,137
On the Beaufort scale,
wind is two, moving south.

21
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:54,307
The sea is calm,
and the sky is clear.

22
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:55,827
Our first goal is
Yurisha's safe return.

23
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,997
Lieutenants Kodai and Niimi,
you will be the escort team.

[KODAI, NIIMI]
Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

It seems so. She mistook

34
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,080
Queen Starsha,
your sister died on Mars

The Earth owes her its survival.

Yes, she gave you hope,
yet what did you do with it?

00:06:38,304 --> 00:06:41,891
You took Wave Motion Energy

by telling me all
that you've seen.

What do you mean she won't?

55
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:21,348
That's right. She told
them we can't have

the Cosmo Reverse System now!

57
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,851
Does that mean she wants
everyone on planet Earth

00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:26,102
to just die out?

[KIRYU] From what I heard,
it wasn't a "no."

She just wanted more time
to make her decision.

Well, either way,
it's unacceptable!

You really think she
would turn us away?

[MORI]
Can you explain?

00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:17,912
When a planet like yours
or mine bears life,

179
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:22,042
the evolutionary memories of its

We can release those memories.

But that means the
Cosmo Reverse System

187
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,392

present to work.

I shall re-engineer this vessel.

And then... the <i>Yamato</i>

To spare your kind.

You sent a glimmer of
hope to save the human race.

We turned that hope
into a weapon

of unimaginable destruction.

The weapon you call
the Wave Motion Gun, Captain.

[STARSHA] Iscandar once
wielded the ruthless power

00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,707
of this weapon to stain the

with blood, and forge

of that weapon.

So we never gave the

and tried to prevent its use.

the only one to survive.

hide him from Gamilas,

were too severe.
