sustained only minimal damage

Thirty-four were wounded.

and is in a coma.

7
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:14,332
[OKITA] Any chance
she'll recover, Doctor?

8
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,126
I'm not optimistic.

9
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:18,753
I'm afraid we'd need
a miracle, Captain.

Hmm...

This is the <i>Yamato</i> .

We have received the Cosmo
Reverse System from Iscandar.

22

I see.

Then the salvation
the Iscandarians

25
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,961
offered us was real.

You did it.
My god, you actually did it.

27

our teeth for a year.

Counting the days.

on the <i>Yamato</i> 's return.

30

[TODO sighs]
But where's your captain?

31

Where's Admiral Okita?

32
00:03:17,312 --> 00:03:18,730
He's led bravely.

But his Planet Bomb Syndrome's
returned and intensified.

is Yuki all right?

Lieutenant Mori
has been wounded in combat.

She's alive,
but her condition is...

40
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,041
[TODO] Your transmission's
breaking up, can you hear me?

42
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:42,587
[AIHARA] The relays we're

I'll keep working on them, but I
think we'll need more time, sir.

It's fine.

The point is that we're close.
We're back home!

46
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:52,097
[OTA]
Yeah. We've done it.

47
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,598
[KODAI]
Hey.

48
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:55,433
Just 'cause we're near our own
solar system doesn't mean

49
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:56,935
we can drop our guard!

[CIC OFFICER 15A]
Did you hear?

54
00:04:07,862 --> 00:04:10,156
Rumor is there's another
ghost on the <i>Yamato</i> now!

55
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,366
[NIIMI]
Mm?

56
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:13,743
Heard this one's in
a Cosmo Navy uniform!

57
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:16,121
[HAYASHI] But what I saw wasn't
really a ghost, remember?

58
00:04:16,204 --> 00:04:18,206
It was Yurisha.

59
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:19,582
[CIC OFFICER 15A] I think
this is different, though.

00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,501
--[NIIMI gasps]
--I heard it's a guy.

61

--[HAYASHI] Huh?
--Well, that's no fun.

62
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:24,838
And there's more.

63
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:27,424
It's a uniform but
not from our own ship!

64
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:29,634
[HAYASHI]
What? How does that make sense?

65
00:04:29,718 --> 00:04:31,302
[SAWAMURA]
Seriously.

66
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:33,596
Why would a ghost from another
ship be on the <i>Yamato</i> ?

67
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,181
[CIC OFFICER 15A]
That's the big mystery.

68
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:36,558
Spooky, huh?

69
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:37,934
[CIC OFFICER 15A]
Speaking of ship drama,

70
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:40,186
you guys hear anything more
about Lieutenant Mori?

71
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,604
--[HAYASHI] No.
--[gasps]

72
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:43,523
[SAWAMURA] I heard the
X.O. wants to put her in there.

73
00:04:52,365 --> 00:04:53,658
[DR. SADO]
Best case scenario,

74
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:56,661
we get her back to Earth
and into a real hospital.

75
00:04:56,745 --> 00:04:59,831
But... I'm afraid her
probability of survival,

76
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:03,293
is still likely to
be less than 0.1%.

77
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:06,880
[KODAI] Okay. Well, that's
better than nothing, right?

78
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:09,299
The immediate problem is
I don't think her body

79
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:11,593
can hold out long enough
for us to reach Earth.

80
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:14,179
[DR. SADO]
Which is why we'll intervene.

81
00:05:14,262 --> 00:05:15,430
Uh?

82
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:17,599
[SANADA] There is a way
we can stabilize her.

83
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:18,975
At least, we hope.

84
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:20,727
[gasps]

85
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,687
[SANADA] The capsule
that kept Yurisha alive

86
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:24,689
during her coma
is still functional.

87
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:26,983
We believe it can
work on Mori, as well.

88
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:47,837
[TOKUGAWA]
Captain. Captain!

89

[OKITA]
Hmm...?

90
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:52,092
I came in to check on you.

91
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:54,594
Looks like you were
having a nightmare.

92
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:57,055
I'm fine, just a harmless dream.

93
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:59,391
It was about
Mamoru Kodai actually.

94
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:01,476
You know, I've been
thinking about him, too,

95
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,853
about how he served
with us on the <i>Kirishima</i> .

96
00:06:03,937 --> 00:06:07,232
You were captain of that crew
and I was running the engines.

97
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:10,110
He was a new
Weapons Officer, wasn't he?

98
00:06:10,193 --> 00:06:12,570
That was during the
Second Battle of Mars.

99
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:15,615
As if I could ever forget that.

100
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,409
Before this ship,
it's the one battle

101
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:20,829
against the Gamilans we won.
That success allowed us

102
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:25,709
to push back their invasion, and
made the rest of this possible.

103
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:29,045
[OKITA] But we lost a great
deal in that battle, too.

Tokugawa.

105
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:34,009
Yes, Captain?

106
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:36,720
You believe this is
a good ship, don't you?

107
00:06:36,803 --> 00:06:39,139
You think we've done well?

108
00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:42,183
I do. No doubt in my mind

109
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:44,310
[OKITA]
I'm proud of this ship.

110
00:06:44,394 --> 00:06:48,732
Proud of her crew.
I have no illusions.

111
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:51,484
The flame of my life
won't burn much longer.

I hope the younger generation
can keep her good soul intact.

All this morbid talk
is worrying me.

116
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:04,748
Relax, Chief, I'm not dying yet.

117
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:08,043
Not until I've seen the Earth
again with my own eyes.

of passing the torch.

I think I should get back
to the engine room.

still got a lot to teach him.

what is wrong with Aihara?

[NANBU] Let's just say
he got some bad news.

131
00:07:55,215 --> 00:07:57,050
My father is dead.

132
00:07:57,133 --> 00:08:00,470
That means my mother
has to take care of herself.

133
00:08:00,553 --> 00:08:02,597
And while we've been away,
the Earth's turned into

134
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:07,894
a total mess. No one's safe.
I'm not sure she can last.

135
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:11,147
Things are bad.
Our world's barely hanging on.

136
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:13,650
But crying about it
won't save anyone.

156
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:10,165
That guy is so old fashioned.
But I think it's for the best.

157
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:12,542
We could all use
something to smile about.

158
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:13,710
[SHIMA sighs]

159
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:17,964
Is this okay?

160
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:20,175
[HARADA] The dress?
I thought I looked good!

161
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:24,429
No. I mean the party.
Are we rubbing it in?

162
00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:26,848
Is this about Kodai?

163
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:30,143
It's an act. He's forcing
himself to be cheerful,

164
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:31,978
for the sake of everyone else.

165
00:09:32,062 --> 00:09:35,357
But the truth is,
he's falling apart.

166
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,443
Even so! Let's do this!

167
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:40,111
If he's trying
to lift people's spirits

168
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:41,696
then so should we!

169
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,947
Makoto.

170
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:44,449
We're staying positive.

171
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:47,786
For Earth, and for
our little one, too.

172
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:49,954
[KATO]
Hmph. Yeah, you're right.

173
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:52,707
That's the spirit, now tell me
which one you like best!

174
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,834
[KATO] I still vote for
the traditional kimono.

175
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:56,169
No way!

176
00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:58,463
[DR. SADO] New life's born
as the old passes away.

177
00:09:58,546 --> 00:10:01,257
Guess I should find
that inspiring. Right?

178
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:03,510
[ANALYZER] To what are
you referring, Doctor?

179
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:05,345
[DR. SADO]
I don't know.

180
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:08,723
Hey, since we left Iscandar,
you've been coming here a lot.

181
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:09,974
What gives?

182
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:11,935
[ANALYZER] I find this
environment calms me.

183
00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:14,187
Ah. I see.

184
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,107
Then you might as well
stick around, tin-man.

185
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,525
[ANALYZER]
You mean that?

186
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:21,569
[DR. SADO growls]
Don't make me say it again!

187
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:28,618
[HARADA] So, Yuki. Kato and I
are about to get married.

188
00:10:28,702 --> 00:10:30,954
Can you believe that?
Oh, and hey, get this.

189
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:33,081
When Kodai found out,
he went straight to Kato,

190
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:36,459
and was all like, "You have to
have a party. For all of us!"

191
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:38,795
I mean he actually said that!

192
00:10:38,878 --> 00:10:42,257
And Kato--being Kato--was
totally mortified, of course.

193
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,843
But in the end, he agreed to it.

194
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:46,302
Guys are cute, aren't they?

195
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:48,513
They get frazzled by
the weirdest things.

196
00:10:48,596 --> 00:10:49,681
Ah.

197
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:54,102
[gasps]
Yuki!

198
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:58,523
[HARADA gasps]
Finally. Just hold on.

199
00:10:58,606 --> 00:11:01,234
I'll get the doctor, okay?

200
00:11:01,317 --> 00:11:03,987
Doctor! Get in here, now!

201
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,238
Get in where?

202
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:07,907
To automatic navigation,
you old dummy!

203
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:11,202
[SANADA]
What's your analysis?

204
00:11:11,286 --> 00:11:13,913
It appears to be an interlocking
recursive structure.

205
00:11:13,997 --> 00:11:17,584
The System, it's behaving
like a brain's neural network.

206
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,878
We know it needed
matter from the ship itself.

207
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:21,546
But there's something
else making it act like

208
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:25,091
a living creature.
Like something intelligent.

209
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:27,886
Right. So this
wave motion pattern--

210
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:30,430
It's the memory that
can rebuild the Earth.

211
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:33,391
[SANADA] Interesting theory.
But the question is:

212
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:36,478
If a mind is shaping the
memory, whose mind is it?

213
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:39,147
[KIRYU] Could it be...
a collective subconscious,

214
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,941
using the minds of the crew
to make this memory of Earth?

215
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:43,485
Is that possible?

216
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:45,612
[SANADA]
Or is it one mind instead?

217
00:11:45,695 --> 00:11:46,696
[KIRYU gasps]

218
00:11:47,697 --> 00:11:50,533
[SANADA]
Could it be... you?

219
00:11:56,623 --> 00:11:57,707
[NIIMI sighs]

220
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:02,087
[SANO]
Wave Motion Control Room.

221
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,465
I-I can't understand you
when you're yelling, Doctor!

222
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:06,466
[NIIMI gasps]

223
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:08,301
[SANO]
Yes, the X.O. is here.

224
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:10,512
I'll send him immediately,
but what's going on with

225
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:12,555
Lieutenant Mori? Is it bad?

226
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:19,646
[ringing]

227
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:23,233
[KODAI gasps]

228
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:30,824
[KODAI]
Yeah.

229
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,077
[gasps]

230
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,287
[heart monitor flat lines]

231
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:41,584
[pants]

232
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:45,130
Oh, no...

233
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:48,341
[HARADA sobs]

234
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:50,218
[KODAI grunts]

235
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:54,597
[screams]

236
00:12:55,932 --> 00:12:57,392
[KODAI sobs]

237
00:12:57,475 --> 00:12:59,602
[DR. SADO] Before she died,
she somehow found the strength

238
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:03,189
to open her eyes. I'm sorry.

239
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:05,608
The last thing she said
was your name, Kodai.

240
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:09,195
She said she... wanted
to see you again...

241
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,992
So did I... [sobs]
I wanted to see you, too...

242
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:15,744
I wanted it more
than anything...

243
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:20,832
[HARADA sobbing]

244
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:29,174
[KODAI]
X.O. I have a request...

245
00:13:29,257 --> 00:13:30,800
Don't tell anyone
else about this.

246
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:32,010
They don't need to know.

247
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:33,386
[gasping]

248
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,766
[KODAI whimpers]
We've almost made it home...

249
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:41,311
I don't want them to
hear any more sad news...

250
00:13:41,394 --> 00:13:43,063
They've been through enough.

251
00:13:56,451 --> 00:14:03,458
[applause, cheering]

252
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:09,005
[chattering, laughing]

253
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:12,217
[SHINOHARA chuckles] What do you
think, Ace? Maybe it's our turn.

254
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,385
Gah.

255
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:21,768
Congratulations.

256
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:23,144
Uh. Thanks.

257
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:24,521
[KODAI]
And you, too, Harada.

258
00:14:24,604 --> 00:14:26,606
[HARADA]
Thank you very much.

259
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,317
[KATO] Kodai, remember
when we were first assigned

260
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,486
to this ship?
What I said to you?

261
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:32,654
[KODAI]
Hmm?

262
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:36,032
I thought you were
just some reckless punk.

263
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:38,702
I said that if you ever issued a
command that got my men killed

264
00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:42,288
for nothing,
I would make you pay.

265
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:46,084
And well... You delivered
on every mission we had.

266
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,877
No one could have led us better.

267
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:49,963
You deserve to
have something good.

268
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:51,589
And Mori's gonna be just fine.

269
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:53,425
[gasps]
Sabu!

270
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:56,428
[KATO]
Eh? What? I say something wrong?

271
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,971
--[KODAI] Kato.
--[BOTH] Huh?

272
00:14:58,054 --> 00:15:01,141
Thank you. Make her happy, okay?

273
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:03,059
[NIIMI]
Mamoru Kodai?

274
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:06,438
You think he's the core of
the Cosmo Reverse System?

275
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:08,023
[SANADA]
I've considered it carefully,

276
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:11,109
and it's the most
logical conclusion.

277
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:12,444
[NIIMI]
Doctor.

278
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:15,155
Have you heard?
There've been rumors circulating

279
00:15:15,238 --> 00:15:18,366
around the <i>Yamato</i> crew
about a new ghost.

280
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,576
[SANADA]
Hmm?

281
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:21,327
I've been afraid you
would laugh, and tell me

282
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:25,415
I was being unscientific.
But I saw him myself.

283
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:29,210
It was Mamoru!
I'm sure of it!

284
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:30,503
It's like Clarke's third law:

285
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:32,297
"Any sufficiently
advanced technology

286
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,216
is indistinguishable
from magic. Heh.

287
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,593
[NIIMI]
Huh?

288
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:39,929
Iscandar has technology
far more advanced than ours.

289
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:42,766
My theory is that after he died,
Starsha had some way

290
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:45,560
to preserve his consciousness.

291
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:48,730
We're almost close enough to see
the Earth with our own eyes!

292
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:50,482
[TECH OFFICER 26A]
Aw, man, I can't wait!

293
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:57,322
[SANADA] His mind has
been used as the core,

294
00:15:57,405 --> 00:15:59,699
the key to activate the wave
motion record of Earth

295
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:02,494
locked in the
matter of this ship.

296
00:16:02,577 --> 00:16:05,455
In a sense, right now,
Mamoru Kodai is

297
00:16:05,538 --> 00:16:07,207
the Cosmo Reverse System.

298
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,710
Extrapolated further,
he's now the <i>Yamato</i> itself.

299
00:16:35,902 --> 00:16:40,115
[KODAI] Yuki. Do you remember
the first time we met?

300
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:43,118
[KODAI]
A rocky start.

301
00:16:47,747 --> 00:16:52,836
[KODAI] Back then, I was so
angry about losing my brother.

302
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:55,046
I was lashing out.

303
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,173
It wasn't the best way
to meet someone.

304
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:00,552
[KODAI]
Then, before we knew it,

305
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:02,846
we were onboard
the <i>Yamato</i> together.

306
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:05,932
We were so different,
and fought all the time.

307
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:09,853
[KODAI] But eventually, you took
a chance and opened up to me.

308
00:17:09,936 --> 00:17:12,313
Told me how you lost
your memories.

309
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:15,734
[KODAI] How, despite
all you'd been through,

310
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:17,944
you kept trying
to stay positive.

311
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:21,322
I didn't even understand
what was happening.

312
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:25,493
But I just...
I was so drawn to you.

313
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:28,621
[gasps]
When you were kidnapped...

314
00:17:28,705 --> 00:17:31,583
...and I found you in space...

315
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:36,087
...that's when I finally
realized how I actually felt.

316
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:41,176
[whimpers] I love you.
I love you so much.

317
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:43,970
More than anyone
else in the world.

318
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:48,224
[sobs] We went through
all this to save our world...

319
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:50,185
But what's the point of
me living in that world

320
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:54,105
if you won't be in it...?
What's the point?!

321
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:57,525
[sobs]

322
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,236
Susumu. I couldn't
come back home

323
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,365
like I promised.
But I can do this.

324
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:08,787
I'm returning the ship
to you now, Captain Okita.

325
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:18,254
The system is
starting up on its own!

326
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:20,006
It's what? But why?!

327
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,508
[SANO]
I don't know!

328
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:23,009
[BOTH grunt, gasp]

329
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:32,185
[KIRYU]
Output is dropping fast!

330
00:18:32,268 --> 00:18:34,646
[SANO] This is bad! If it keeps
discharging at this rate.

331
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:35,939
[SANADA]
Keep it going!

332
00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:37,982
Don't let the Cosmo Reverse
System shut down!

333
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:39,109
[SANO]
It's no use, sir!

334
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:41,111
It's not accepting
any of my commands!

335
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:42,320
[NIIMI grunts]

336
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:47,325
Oh, no. Doctor!

337
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:49,202
[SANADA]
Why...?

338
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:53,206
Why?! Kodai!

339
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:55,333
Why did you start it now?!

340
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:05,301
What the...?

341
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,763
[KODAI gasps]

342
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:14,894
[MORI sighs]

343
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:16,187
[gasps]

344
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:18,481
Kodai? What...

345
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:20,567
[gasps]

346
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,985
Yuki!

347
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,865
Ah!

348
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,408
Yuki!

349
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:30,994
[sobs]

350
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:34,539
[MORI]
What am I... doing here?

351
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:38,918
I was shot. And then I...
Did I die...?

352
00:19:39,002 --> 00:19:41,921
[KODAI sighs]
Just a dream.

353
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:43,214
A dream?

354
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:45,425
Yeah, a bad nightmare.

355
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:48,803
That's all. I was
having one, too.

356
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,182
Kodai!

357
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:08,031
[SANADA] Inspect every
part of the system!

358
00:20:08,114 --> 00:20:09,574
Prepare to reboot!

359
00:20:09,657 --> 00:20:12,911
[NIIMI] His mind fired
a massive activation pulse.

360
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:16,664
Now, it's almost entirely
lost in the quantum sea.

361
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,833
Without it, we can't reactivate.

362
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,586
So... Even if the
<i>Yamato</i> makes it to Earth...

363
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,171
...we won't be able to save it?

364
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:24,631
It's over?

365
00:20:24,714 --> 00:20:27,467
Kodai. No. How could you?

366
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,677
[ALL gasp]

367
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,012
After everything
we went through.

368
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:34,015
Is this your will?!
Is this what you really wanted?!

369
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:40,689
[NANBU] There she is!
We can see the Earth!

370
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:48,905
[OKITA]
Doctor Sado.

371
00:20:48,988 --> 00:20:50,073
[DR. SADO]
Hmm?

372
00:20:50,156 --> 00:20:52,867
Would you... mind
leaving me for a moment?

373
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,911
I'd like to be alone.

374
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:02,293
[OKITA]
One more thing, Doctor.

375
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:03,461
[DR. SADO]
Ah?

376
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:08,717
[OKITA]
Thank you.

377
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,884
[DR. SADO whimpers]

378
00:21:15,932 --> 00:21:19,102
[door creaks, shuts]

379
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:37,203
[OKITA]
My dear mother Earth.

380
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:39,330
How I've missed you.

381
00:21:39,414 --> 00:21:43,001
Seeing you brings back
so many memories.

382
00:22:09,944 --> 00:22:11,863
The Cosmo Reverse
System rebooted.

383
00:22:11,946 --> 00:22:16,159
And I think it's reactivating.
What do you think happened, sir?

384
00:22:16,242 --> 00:22:21,456
I don't know. Perhaps...
We're witnessing a miracle.

385
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,216
[NIIMI]
Mamoru!

386
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:34,219
[MAMORU]
Goodbye, Sanada.

387
00:22:34,302 --> 00:22:36,054
Goodbye, Kaoru.

388
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:46,231
[gasps, yells]

389
00:22:46,314 --> 00:22:51,319
[gasping]

390
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,159
Guess stuff like this
really does happen.

391
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,203
I'm so happy!

392
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:01,996
[sobs]

393
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,332
And so am I.

394
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,167
[SHIMA]
Welcome back.

395
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,794
Or make that welcome home.

396
00:23:07,877 --> 00:23:10,630
--Mori!
--[laughter]

397
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:13,508
[YAMAMOTO] I think
I can speak for all of us.

398
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:14,801
[gasps]

399
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:17,387
Welcome back, Lieutenant Mori.

400
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,555
[MISAKI whimpers]

401
00:23:23,143 --> 00:23:24,477
Thank you all.

402
00:23:33,403 --> 00:23:34,487
[gasps]

403
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:39,576
[DR. SADO whimpers]

404
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:42,370
