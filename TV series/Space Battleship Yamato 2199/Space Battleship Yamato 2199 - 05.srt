gonna put up a real fight.

with advanced

Iscandarian defense technology
called the Wave Motion Shields.

more than ample protection
from the enemy's positron beams.

[KODAI] We plan to launch

168
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,416
She'll serve as a decoy.

Drawing the bulk of the enemy

170
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,875

course through Nyx's orbit,

loop around Charon then
onto Pluto, staying low.

172
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,291
There they'll split up
and search for the base.

173
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,666
And once they locate it.
They'll destroy it.

174
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,083
Meanwhile, the <i>Yamato</i>
will try to break through

enough to Pluto's surface

for the squadron.

Most likely, but we won't.

for no reason at all, sir!
