[DESLER]
I see.

2
00:01:56,398 --> 00:01:58,233
So the Iscandarians had it.

00:01:58,316 --> 00:01:59,150
[chirps]

4
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:00,694
Yes.

5
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:03,655
Mirenel gave up her life
for that information.

6
00:02:03,738 --> 00:02:05,615
[DESLER]
Another Jirel has fallen.

7
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:08,118
That makes you the last one.

[BLUE BIRD chirps]

00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:12,747
And I've not forgotten you saved
me from sharing their fate.

10
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:14,499
Even if I am the last of us.

[chirps]

12
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:18,962
I shall always remain
loyal to you, my lord.

13
00:02:19,045 --> 00:02:21,423
Loyalty is a precious thing.

14
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,055
[GIMLEH] So you're telling me
you chose to retreat,

15
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:32,475
because you were unable to deal
with a single, native rebellion?

16
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:33,935
[DROPPE]
They surrounded the capital!

17
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,563
W-We had to leave, there was
nothing else we could do!

18
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:39,357
Director-General Gimleh,
please use your fleet

19
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:42,652
to protect our people
who couldn't evacuate!

20
00:02:42,736 --> 00:02:45,655
Heh. We will bathe
this planet in fire.

00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:46,906
[gasps]

22
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,616
[GIMLEH] A world that
rebels against our Lord

23
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,452
sets a dangerous example.

24
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:54,414
We cannot allow such a blight
to exist in our Empire.

25
00:02:54,497 --> 00:02:56,875
No more than we can allow
the existence of a governor

26
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,543
who lets that blight spread.

27
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:00,795
Is that some kind of joke?

28
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,548
[DROPPE gasps, groans]

I've never been a fan of comedy.

Now, then. Let the
symphony of death begin!

[TECH OFFICER 15A]
That's the recoil brake

33
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:28,967
for the gravity anchor.
Make sure it's fastened tight.

Hey.

What are you doin'
all the way down here?

36
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:33,638
[MISAKI]
This mechanism. What is it?

37
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:35,140
Uh, what?

38
00:04:35,223 --> 00:04:38,518
Uh, what are you talkin' about?
It's the Wave Motion Gun.

[MISAKI]
Uh...

40
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:41,271
But what is that?

41
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:42,897
[SHINOHARA]
Complex stuff, huh?

42
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:45,025
Leave it to the mechanics
to figure out.

43
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:46,151
I'm her pilot.

44
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:47,902
I wanna make sure
she's taken care of.

45
00:04:47,986 --> 00:04:49,904
It sounds like you're
forming quite the bond.

46
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:51,489
[YAMAMOTO]
That doesn't look right.

--[footsteps]
--[SHINOHARA] Uh?

Hey, Kodai!

Still haven't let that go, huh?

50
00:04:58,538 --> 00:04:59,581
Of course not!

51
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:01,499
Next time maybe
I'll fly a fighter

52
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,419
and you'll wish that
I was in the wing, too!

53
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:06,338
[KODAI] We thought leaving the
Milky Way would help,

54
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:08,048
but we're seeing
the enemy even more.

There's no time to play around.

Who's playing? I'm serious!

Teach me to fly,

What's goin' on with her?

Actually she's got
a lot going on, sir.

ever took off your blinders.

Uh, of course, ma'am.

00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,180
Do you think it's another
reconnaissance team?

79
00:05:57,263 --> 00:05:58,807
You'll have to ask the enemy.

80
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,018
All crew, stand by at battle
stations and prepare for attack.

81
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:03,478
[MORI]
Distance: nine megameters.

get any rest if we don't--

00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:28,795
Well I can hardly blame
her for being upset.

[SHINOHARA chuckles]

92
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:31,506
She's goin' through some stuff.

93
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:33,174
[HIRATA] It's still going
to take more time

94
00:06:33,258 --> 00:06:35,427
to get the O.M.C.S. back online.

95
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,178
We need to find
more food and water.

96
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:40,015
Or we'll be at risk of
running out of our supplies.

97
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:41,808
Yeah, but where are we
supposed to do that?

98
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:43,018
We're between galaxies.

99
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:44,811
There aren't any systems
anywhere close.

100
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:46,688
[NIIMI]
There's one.

101
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:48,898
According to the map
provided by Iscandar,

102
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:51,026
there's an inter-galactic
star system roughly

103
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:53,069
four light-years ahead of
our current position.

104
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:56,448
The star's name: Beemela.

105
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:57,782
Beemela, huh?

106
00:06:57,866 --> 00:06:59,993
Observation indicates
the system's fourth planet

107
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:03,663
is likely an Earth-type world,
well within the habitable zone.

108
00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:05,540
Sounds perfect.

109
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:07,709
[NIIMI] We've been stuck
in this ship for too long.

110
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:09,711
Many of our crew are
showing signs of stress,

111
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:11,921
which negatively
affects performance.

112
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:13,340
I think landing there
might be good

113
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:14,799
for their mental health as well.

114
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:16,301
[SANADA]
Hm.

115
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:18,845
[KODAI] Shima. You're the
navigator, what do you think?

116
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:20,764
Yeah. We could swing it.

117
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:23,266
[KODAI] It's not gonna
mess up our schedule?

118
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:26,561
[SHIMA]
No. We'll be okay.

119
00:07:26,644 --> 00:07:27,896
[KODAI]
All right, then.

120
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,230
[ITO chuckles]

121
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:34,110
[OBAMA]
This is rough.

122
00:07:34,194 --> 00:07:38,406
I'm gonna go mad if we have to
keep eating this every day.

My sleep has been
pretty crummy, too.

124
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:42,619
You think Iscandar
really exists,

125
00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:44,662
or are we going through
this for nothing?

on the ship!

That Hayashi guy from
navigation saw her, too!

132
00:07:56,257 --> 00:07:57,801
Then it must be true.

But wait, it gets even juicier!

[SAOTOME] I can't live on this!
I need more food!

141
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,609
I'm sorry but the
O.M.C.S. is down.

142
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:17,153
It's the best we can do for now.

143
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:19,447
[sighs] I think
we're all exhausted.

146

[CIC OFFICER 15A]
Food directly affects morale.

147

[YABU]
Honestly, guys,

148
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:31,459
I'm starting to wonder
if we're gonna make it.

149
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:37,132
[coughs]

150
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:42,679
Oh, Misaki!

151
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:44,806
You haven't broadcast
your show lately--

152
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:47,684
Okay. Nevermind then.

153
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:49,060
[MISAKI]
Tell me.

154
00:08:49,144 --> 00:08:51,187
Is the Wave Motion Gun based
on a specific solution

155
00:08:51,271 --> 00:08:53,356
of the Buchinsky
Wave Motion formula?

156
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,900
[SANADA] Huh?
You've done your homework.

157
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:58,987
Yes, that's right. Using a
specific solution allows us to

158
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,823
release part of a miniaturized
Calabi-Yau manifold.

That will cause them to Geschtam

[OTA] No obstacles

And what about
that neutron star?

317
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:18,510
It'll affect our course,
but we should still get closer.

It appears to be
two enemy vessels

approaching from the rear.

Their speed is
seven space knots.

Damage to port side!

Should we return fire, sir?

Negative, we will
proceed with warp.

But sir!

329
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:43,910
What are we going to do if
they damage our warp engine?

330
00:16:43,993 --> 00:16:46,746
Without sufficient supplies
it would be folly to engage.

That neutron star
will affect our warp.

I'm not sure where
we're going to end up!

[MORI gasps]
We have multiple sightings!

They're behind us, too!

They've got us completely
surrounded, sir!

where it dumped them!

[OKITA] There's not enough
time to use the falcons.

The enemy guns would
just pick them off

We'll fire up the Wave Motion

And then charge straight ahead
at combat speed two.
