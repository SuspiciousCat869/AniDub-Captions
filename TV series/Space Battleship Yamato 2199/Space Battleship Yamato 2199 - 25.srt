1
00:01:57,982 --> 00:02:00,568
[MISAKI] It's been two months
since the <i>Yamato</i> acquired

2
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:04,739
the Cosmo Reverse System,
and left planet Iscandar.

3
00:02:04,823 --> 00:02:07,951
And it's been eight months
since we left planet Earth.

4
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:13,915
[MISAKI] On our journey,
we've lost many friends,

5
00:02:13,998 --> 00:02:17,711
faced many hardships,
and shed many tears.

6
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:24,009
[MISAKI] But through it all,
we've never lost hope.

7
00:02:24,092 --> 00:02:26,011
That's because we knew
the people of Earth

8
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:27,846
believed in us,
and were waiting.

9
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:29,806
Counting on our return.

10
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:48,908
[MISAKI] The first time we made
this trip across the galaxies,

11
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:52,662
deep down, I think we
were all pretty scared.

12
00:02:52,746 --> 00:02:56,833
But this time, it's different.
We've proven it's possible.

13
00:02:56,916 --> 00:03:00,587
Now, the <i>Yamato</i> is heading home
on a path we've already cut,

14
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,048
and carrying hope with it.

15
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:08,511
[sighs]

16
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:09,679
Uh?

17
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:13,600
[giggles]

18
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:18,480
[NIIMI sighs]

19
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,385
Using Balun? What do you mean?

20
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:51,638
I see. You mean we're
using the subspace gate.

21
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:52,847
That's right.

22
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:54,349
You think it still works?

23
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:56,851
But I thought we shut down
the gates with that blast.

24
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:58,186
[SHIMA]
For all we know,

25
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:00,188
different gates could have
different power sources.

26
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:02,315
The one to our galaxy
might still be running.

27
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:04,317
That gate would take us
60,000 light-years

28
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:05,819
in a single warp.

29
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:07,529
We can access it
with the same controller

30
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:08,822
we built last time.

31
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:10,115
Yeah, let's hope.

32
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:12,033
If this does work,
we can compensate

33
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:14,619
for all the time we've lost.

34
00:04:14,703 --> 00:04:16,037
[AIHARA]
Chief of Tactical!

35
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,748
I'm picking up
a possible mayday!

36
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:22,168
And sir... I'm pretty
sure it's Gamilan!

37
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:29,426
[DITZ]
We're finally back.

38
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:31,219
[GHADER]
Allied fleet approaching.

39
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:33,763
It's Minister Talan.

40
00:04:33,847 --> 00:04:36,683
[DITZ] We've been anxiously
awaiting your return.

41
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:38,351
What about your brother?

42
00:04:41,104 --> 00:04:42,522
[DITZ]
I see...

43
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:45,191
[DITZ]
Despite his flaws,

44
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:48,069
Desler was the glue
holding this empire together;

45
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:49,654
keeping the various
factions united to

46
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:51,281
rebuild will be difficult.

47
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:53,283
[GHADER]
Indeed.

48
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:54,951
Hope still remains.

49
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:01,583
[gasps]

00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,126
[squawks]

51
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:05,003
My immediate concern
are the ships rebelling

52
00:05:05,086 --> 00:05:09,257
against your fleet-wide order.
They're refusing to return home.

53
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,925
[DITZ]
I'm well aware.

54
00:05:12,844 --> 00:05:15,847
[DITZ] I've sent someone
I trust to deal with that.

55
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:21,227
[GOER] All this time,
I have served dutifully,

56
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:23,438
leading a fleet of
3,000 stranded ships

57
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:24,981
across the sea of space!

58
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:26,775
Along the way,
we've had to abandon those

59
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:28,568
who allied with
the traitor Ditz.

60
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:30,653
But our 30 greatest
ships remain!

61
00:05:30,737 --> 00:05:33,365
Now. I have braved
the cold, vast expanse

62
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:34,866
to finally meet you again!

63
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:37,702
And your loyal soldier Goer
is overjoyed at this chance!

64
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:39,329
It's the pinnacle of my--

65
00:05:40,497 --> 00:05:43,708
[VELTE groans]
If I may, sir.

66
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:47,128
Why do you continue to
obsess over that one ship?

67
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:51,466
[DESLER] Simple. Because
I want what it has.

68
00:05:51,549 --> 00:05:52,842
[gasps]

69
00:05:52,926 --> 00:05:55,261
[DESLER] To use the ship
that drove me to the brink

70
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:57,931
to power my triumphant return.

71
00:05:58,014 --> 00:06:01,518
Can you imagine
anything more splendid?

72
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:03,937
The glory of Great Gamilas
shall bring order

73
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,731
and salvation to
all the Universe.

74
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,361
Only I can make it happen.

75
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:13,655
And realize the dream.

She's a Gamilan officer, right?

Mori says she knows her,
but are you sure this is safe?

84
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:41,641
She'll be just fine.

85
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:44,102
She's proven she can
take care of herself.

00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:46,855
Yeah. You're right.

87
00:06:50,358 --> 00:06:53,028
[MORI] Well, well. This
feels familiar, doesn't it?

88
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:55,864
Though now we've
switched positions.

89

There's nothing to worry about.

We're going to fix your ship.
So you can get home to Gamilas.

Hmm?

of returning to that planet.

My home has been gone
for a long time.

The people of Jirel
had unique powers.

00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,217
We all possessed a
natural telepathic ability.

destroyed us.

been lost, too, but...

I understand how you feel.
But he died in that battle.

316
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:53,618
[LECTER] A virus! The
mechanical soldiers are failing!

317
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:55,161
[VELTE growls]
Move!

318
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:57,997
Ah!

319
00:20:58,081 --> 00:21:00,500
[SANADA] The data we extracted
before made it possible.

320
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:04,462
We have Alter to thank for this.

321
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:07,841
This way, sir.

322
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,594
Yuki! Yuki!

323
00:21:14,264 --> 00:21:16,099
Don't shoot them.

324
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:18,393
[KODAI grunts]

325
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:20,645
My lord, let's hurry!

326
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:22,063
Wait, "my lord"?

327
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:32,323
That's him...?

328
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:34,951
[LECTER]
Lord Desler has returned.

329
00:21:35,035 --> 00:21:36,578
Prepare to embark.

330
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:53,386
[VELTE] You fool!
Who ordered you to attack?!

331
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,180
I... I'm sorry, sir.

332
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:56,431
You're sorry?!

333
00:21:56,514 --> 00:21:58,308
Don't you realize
we're in subspace?

334
00:21:58,391 --> 00:21:59,809
[door hisses]

335
00:21:59,893 --> 00:22:02,771
[DESLER] Meaning normal beam
weapons won't work, correct?

336
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,398
You're okay, sir!

337
00:22:05,482 --> 00:22:07,108
Beams won't.

338
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,111
But what about
the Desler cannon?

339
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,696
[AIHARA]
Enemy ship is falling back!

340
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,406
At 6 o'clock!

341
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,368
[SANADA] They've seen normal
beams won't work in here.

342
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:18,703
That's a Wave Motion Gun!

343
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:20,080
[CLONE GUARD 23B]
Charging energy!

344
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:22,165
Ninety belas until criticality!

345
00:22:22,248 --> 00:22:25,293
[VELTE] Stop, my lord! We can't
use the Desler Canon here!

346
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,920
It's suicidal!

347
00:22:28,797 --> 00:22:31,800
[DESLER]
Do not interfere, Talan.

348
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,551
But, Lord Desler...

349
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:37,097
Victory at war will never
come to the faint of heart.

350
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,015
[CLONE GUARD 23D]
Target is turning around.

351
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:41,101
[CLONE GUARD 23B]
Energy charge complete.

352
00:22:41,184 --> 00:22:43,937
[DESLER]
Prepare to fire Desler Cannon.

353
00:22:47,023 --> 00:22:48,483
[DESLER growls]

354
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:50,235
[CLONE GUARD 23D]
Target locked!

355
00:22:56,658 --> 00:22:57,992
[VELTE]
How are they hitting us?!

356
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,536
[CLONE GUARD 23D]
They're shells, sir!

357
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:02,122
They're firing
physical cannon shells!

358
00:23:14,968 --> 00:23:16,678
Teron barbarians!

359
00:23:28,606 --> 00:23:30,191
[DESLER] I will bring
peace to all worlds,

360
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,652
in our galaxy and beyond.

361
00:23:32,736 --> 00:23:34,320
I will...

362
00:23:34,404 --> 00:23:36,865
Just as I promised
you back then.

363
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:41,536
[DESLER]
It's all for you.

364
00:24:08,938 --> 00:24:10,648
[OTA]
We made it through the gate!

365
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:12,734
We're at the
Milky Way's outer rim!

366
00:24:12,817 --> 00:24:14,194
[CREW groaning]

367
00:24:14,277 --> 00:24:18,531
[KODAI]
Yuki! Wake up! Don't die on me!

368
00:24:18,615 --> 00:24:19,741
Kodai...

369
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:21,785
Come on, please. Yuki.

370
00:24:21,868 --> 00:24:24,204
We made it.
Just come back to me.
