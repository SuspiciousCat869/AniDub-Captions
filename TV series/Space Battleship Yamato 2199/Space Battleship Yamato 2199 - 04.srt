[SHULTZ] The first question,

[SANADA] The UN's Yamato Plan
was painstakingly drawn,

for error on Pluto.

That said, we have
operational control,

30
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,791
so the decision about
the M-2 contingency

31
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,458
ultimately lies with us.

We have to do it!

We have the firepower
to destroy their Pluto base

34
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,791
and prevent future attacks!

36
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,083
Well, from our coordinates,
we've determined this is

out of our solar system.

We can't make it out.

51
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,458
All we know: It's coming from
the Saturn moon Enceladus,

near its southern pole.

That would still be the
opposite direction from Pluto.

Heh.

the view from Tactical.

If we spend time on a mission,
it shouldn't be on that moon!

We can't waste time on detours!

Isn't that what
you just said to me?

We have to think

Our mission's to reach Iscandar.

It's not to strike

Yes sir, but not nearly enough

Bingo. We're in luck.

Enceladus actually has
a cosmonite mine
