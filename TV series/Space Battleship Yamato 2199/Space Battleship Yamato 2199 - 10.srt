I'm a Gamilan pilot

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,166
of the 707th
Galactic Theater Air Corps.

167
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,916
Name is Melda Ditz.

You may be interested to

They are inferior races

Well do your people

But, of course,
I shouldn't be surprised,

00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,000
considering you Terons love war
so much you attacked us

184

Don't feed us lies,

Now, what's your proposal?

193
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,041
[OKITA]
The Wave Motion Gun?

194
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,291
Yeah.

195
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,333
Interesting and quite
possible, theoretically.

196
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,916
As the name implies,

197
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,250
the gun creates Dimensional Wave
Motion along its line of fire.

198
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,708
If we aim the bow
at the phase boundary

199
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,750
of this dimensional
fault and fire it.

200
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,166
The resulting wave
of interference

201
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,916
should open a hole
we can pass through.

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,916
But how do they know what
the Wave Motion Gun can do?

203
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,666
They were probably
watching when we broke through

204
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,291
that stellar prominence
from Gleise 581.

205
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,583
But the Wave Motion Engine
can't recharge here,

206
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,250
and the gun would deplete
most of our remaining energy.

207
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,958
So, your little plan would
knock the <i>Yamato</i> off-line!

208
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,666
And that's where <i>we</i> come in.

209
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,791
Use your gun and we promise

210
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,625
to use our ship
to tow yours to safety.

211
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,791
We need your help to create

212
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,875
a passageway out of this
dimensional fault.

213
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,166
And you need our help to get
out once that passage is open.

214
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,166
Unless we work together both
ships will be lost.

215
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,583
[SHIMA]
How can we trust them?

216
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,583
After we fire the gun
there's nothing to stop them

217
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,583
from leaving us here to die!

218
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,125
Why wouldn't they betray us?

219
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,083
These are the same demons
who blame us for the war.

220
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,708
While we stand around talking,

221
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,875
the engine continues
to leak energy.

222
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,916
So, whatever we do
we need to decide quickly,

223
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,708
or the Wave Motion Gun
won't even be an option.

00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:02,666
I agree, Chief.

We don't have time to hesitate.

Okay. So what do we do now?

I mean is there
anything we can do?

There is.

believe the Gamilans.

I don't understand.

Stay on alert.

Right now our
only focus is escape.

Three minutes to reentry
into normal space.

You're a pilot, aren't you?

We don't need a little pistol,

we'll settle this

All right, <i>Yamato</i> .
