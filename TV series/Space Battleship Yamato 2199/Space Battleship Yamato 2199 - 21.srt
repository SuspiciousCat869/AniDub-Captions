Ten-four. Opening hatch.

162
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:51,553
[KODAI]
Is that true? You're sure of it?

163
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:55,056
[YURISHA] Yes, of course.
She's on this world.

164
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,474
[KODAI]
How do you know?

165
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:58,601
Because I love her.

166
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:00,270
Don't you love her as well?

167
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:01,229
[KODAI]
Um.

168
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:02,647
[YURISHA]
Don't you?

169
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:03,940
[KODAI]
I...

170
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,613
Is this really the right time
to be gossiping about love?

171
00:13:10,697 --> 00:13:13,033
Ito. You're still alive?

172
00:13:13,116 --> 00:13:15,160
Yes, I am. Is that a problem?

173
00:13:15,243 --> 00:13:16,578
No.

174
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:19,456
Well, it's nice to see you
can be so relaxed, Kodai.

175
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:22,125
Even after so many have died
on this doomed quest.

176
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,793
And it looks like
Mori's cosplaying.

177
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:25,378
I kinda feel jealous.

178
00:13:25,462 --> 00:13:27,547
[KODAI] You wouldn't know this
since you've been locked away,

179
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,383
but that's not Mori
you're pointing a gun at.

180
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:32,135
[ITO]
Oh, I know all too well.

181
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:34,971
That's an alien.
Mori was a false identity.

182
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:37,349
Her true name is
Yurisha Iscandar.

183
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:38,224
[KODAI]
You're wrong!

184
00:13:38,308 --> 00:13:40,060
I mean, you're part right, but--

185
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:42,103
Hey! Freeze!

186
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:42,979
Sit down!

187
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:44,522
[ITO]
Wrong choice.

I'm sorry!

00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:56,117
Damn it!

192
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:01,831
[KODAI] Everyone,
grab hold of something!

193
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,868
An imperial inspection ship?

194
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:41,663
[PRISON GUARD A] Yes, Warden.
It will arrive shortly.

195
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:44,541
Do you think they know
what we've been selling

196
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:46,251
on the black market, sir?

197
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:47,836
Damn!

198
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,464
This could wreck my plan to get
back home, and I was so close!

199
00:14:51,548 --> 00:14:53,967
Wait, I still have a play.

200
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:04,185
Ah. I hardly recognized you!

201
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:06,771
You finally look like an
Iscandarian princess!

[BOZEN]
What?

205
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:11,693
[PRISON GUARD A] One of
our patrols has discovered

206
00:15:11,776 --> 00:15:13,737
what appear to be
escaped prisoners.

207
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,363
Can't you see I'm busy?

We'll get to the bottom
of this! Let's go!

210
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:36,092
That's the ship.

211
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:39,429
Out of the frying pan and
into the fire. Lovely.

212
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:41,514
It's your fault.

213
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:43,308
All that's happened...

from the warden!
