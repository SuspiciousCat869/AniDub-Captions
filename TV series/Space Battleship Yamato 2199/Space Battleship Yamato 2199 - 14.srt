00:19:51,264 --> 00:19:52,515
[gasps]

322
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,434
That stung a bit.

323
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:00,440
[LINKE grunts]

324
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,027
That's a Geschtam Field!

325
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,323
[COMPUTER VOICE] Releasing Wave
Motion Field in conduit bay.

326
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:10,909
Please evacuate immediately.

327
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:14,913
[COMPUTER VOICE]
Restarting Wave Motion Engine.

328
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:16,790
[screams]

329
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,418
[phone ringing]

330
00:20:22,337 --> 00:20:24,589
[LINKE screams]

331
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:30,887
[thuds]

332
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,935
[sighs]

333
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:39,312
[MORI groans]

334
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:49,906
[BRIDGE OFFICER]
Ghost Link severed.

335
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:53,243
Special Ops Officer Linke's mind
isn't returning to her body.

336
00:20:53,326 --> 00:20:56,079
Transferred data has been saved.

337
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:04,087
If you're gone, Mirenel,
then I am all alone.

338
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:08,341
[DOMEL]
Those ruins were left behind

339
00:21:08,425 --> 00:21:11,094
by the race that
built the gates.

340
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:14,097
There's a rumor she's
one of their descendants.

341
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,475
So, what did she come here
hoping to accomplish, anyway?

342
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:20,979
The motive of witches cannot
be known by average men.

343
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:23,356
[GOER] Hm?
Who're you calling average?

344
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,733
[ZOELLIK]
So, what you're telling me is

345
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,401
that annoying space wolf
and the witch

346
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:29,654
are both hopelessly fixated on
a Yamato now, is that right?

347
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:30,822
[GOER]
Yes, sir.

348
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:31,865
[ZOELLIK'S COURTESAN 14A]

349
00:21:31,948 --> 00:21:33,908
[ZOELLIK]
Then this is our moment.

350
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,036
Our moment for what, sir?

351
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:39,330
Yeah, you don't need to
know, just obey.

352
00:21:45,503 --> 00:21:47,547
[MORI] Doctor Sado says
everyone seems to have been

353
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,425
reliving their most
important memories.

354
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:55,013
Well I saw my mom and dad,
back at home on Earth.

355
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:56,848
That and--

356
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,227
So what memory
did you get to see?

357
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:03,855
Oh, sorry.

358
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:05,940
Don't be.

359
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:09,235
Actually, I saw someone
I cared about, too.

360
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:11,029
[KODAI]
Uh?

361
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:14,699
And in the end, you came
for me, right, Kodai?

362
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:16,868
Uh, yeah, so?

363
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:18,286
[MORI giggles]

364
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,164
Uh, hey, Mori, wait!

365
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:22,665
What did you mean by that?

366
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:24,209
[MORI]
It's a secret.

367
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:25,877
[KODAI]
Come on!

368
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:30,423
[MISAKI]
Now it's goodbye to me.

369
00:22:30,507 --> 00:22:32,926
And hello to you.

370
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:35,470
You're Misaki again.

371
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:37,806
Yuria Misaki.
