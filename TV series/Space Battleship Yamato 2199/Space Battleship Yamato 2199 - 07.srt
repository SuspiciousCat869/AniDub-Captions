00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,208
[beeping]

2
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:55,916
[AIHARA]
Message from Director Todo.

3
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,916
[TODO] So you've already
made it to the outer edge

4
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,666
of the solar system, Admiral.

5
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,458
It may seem like
a giant leap to us.

6
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:07,250
But on the long road to Iscandar
it's only the first small step.

7
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,958
True enough.

8
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,666
But news of the
<i>Yamato</i> destroying

9
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,000
the enemy's Pluto base has
spread all across the globe.

10
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,333
The planet bomb barrage is over.

11
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,791
You have no idea how
much relief that's brought.

12
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,375
And how much hope.

13
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,666
Just knowing you're headed for
Iscandar helps us keep going.

14
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,333
We can believe there's a way.

15
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,000
So find that way, Admiral.

16
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,041
Retrieve the Cosmo
Reverse System.

17
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,541
All of Earth is behind you.

18
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,333
And the <i>Yamato</i> 's
successful return home.

19
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,208
[AIHARA] The heliopause
is disrupting our transmission.

20
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,625
I'll need five minutes to set up

21
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,041
the long-range
signal boosters, sir.

22
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,375
[OKITA]
Mm.

23
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,041
[ITO]
Oh, you're actually alone.

24
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,125
The XO's gone for once.

25
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,125
More free time?

26
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,000
Well, unless crewmen
are fighting over cards.

27
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,708
There's really not much
for security to do right now.

28
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,083
Hmm. So how are things for you?

29
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,458
[NIIMI]
Not much for me to do either,

30
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,833
at least, until we reach
a new star system.

31
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,375
Huh.

32
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:14,666
[ITO] I hear you're offering
counseling sessions to the crew.

33
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,250
I could use some
one-on-one therapy myself.

34
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,416
Please, take your
hand off of me.

35
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,833
[ITO]
Once we cross the heliopause,

36
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:29,208
we won't be able
to talk to Earth.

37
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,208
Wouldn't it be nice if
the captain let everyone

38
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,583
onboard make one last call home?

39
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,041
Wait.

40
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,708
Or would that just
make us all homesick?

41
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,666
I guess I'll have to leave
that to the counselor.

42
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,083
[ITO]
Hmph.

43
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,708
Okay.

44
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,083
Call me if you
need some security.

45
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,416
This is the
updated duty list, huh?

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,625
Hey, Kodai.

47
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,500
Huh?

48
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,541
On our way down to Enceladus.

49
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,125
You asked me something
strange, remember?

50
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,166
It's just.

51
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,625
Well are you related
to any aliens?

52
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,166
You were talking
about Sasha, weren't you?

53
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,541
[KODAI]
Huh?

54
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,333
When you asked I had no
idea what you meant by that.

55
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,750
But then I remembered,
you saw her on Mars.

56
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,791
That <i>is</i> why you asked me, right?

57
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,833
[KODAI]
Yeah, she did look like you.

58
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,416
Heh... Sasha Iscandar.

59
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,000
The brave traveler

60
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:30,666
who gave her life to bring us
the engine's activation core.

61
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,666
And the captain.

62
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,541
Didn't he tell us another
Iscandarian came a year ago?

63
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,708
The one who gave us the plans

64
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,458
for the engine
in the first place?

65
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,458
[MORI]
Yurisha Iscandar.

66
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,541
[MORI]
That was her name.

67
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,750
[SHIMA]
Final calls home, sir?

68
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,708
Huh?

69
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,875
[OKITA]
Hmm...

70
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,375
Beyond the heliopause,

71
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,500
a rise in galactic cosmic rays
and other interference

72
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,208
will severely impede our
communication with Earth.

73
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,791
So we're going to give our
crew the opportunity to speak

74
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,958
to their families now
before we're cut off.

75
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,833
Whoa, seriously?

76
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,750
And we'll be having
a line-crossing ceremony

77
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,291
as we leave our system, too.

78
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,375
[gasps]
A line-crossing?

79
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,125
Isn't that for the equator?

80
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,541
[OKITA]
That's right.

81
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,291
Earth's sailors began the
tradition a long time ago.

82
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:25,083
Asking for safe passage as
they crossed that great divide.

83
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,458
And now we're going
to do the same.

84
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,958
[HARADA shrieks]

85
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,250
But Ota said everyone wears
costumes to a line-crossing!

86
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,875
He said it's tradition!

87
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,375
He really pranked you good!

88
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,250
[laughs]

89
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,916
You define the word "gullible."

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,625
[HARADA growls]

91
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,000
Where are you hiding, Ota?
You'll pay!

92
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,458
For future reference,
don't listen to a word he says.

93
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:51,375
[jangling metal]

94
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,083
[HARADA]
Hmm?

95
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,500
[gasps]

96
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:01,583
Relax. I think that
outfit looks good on you.

97
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,291
[giggles]
Thanks.

98
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,500
Crewmen,

99
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,833
because of your fearless
and heroic efforts,

100
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:14,083
Operation M-2 was
a resounding success.

101
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:18,416
The Pluto base no longer stands
to rain down terror on Earth.

102
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,750
I want to thank you
all for that.

103
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:24,041
This ceremony marks our
exit from our solar system.

104
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,750
But the long voyage
has only begun.

105
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,458
When we cross this line,
do not look back.

106
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,000
Look ahead.

107
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,291
Keep your eyes on
the path to Iscandar.

108
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,500
We pray for safety as
we cross the great line!

109
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,916
To the stars!

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,041
[ALL]
To the stars!

111
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,250
Ahh...!

112
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,083
Hm? Hey, pal.

113
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,333
Want a swig of the good stuff?

114
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,333
[ANALYZER] I am not
designed for fluid intake.

115
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,375
What a tragic existence.

116
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,708
[YAMAMOTO]
Huh?

117
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,291
Lieutenant Hirata.

118
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:11,416
You know I was in officer school
with your new wing buddy.

119
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,583
[YAMAMOTO]
I've been meaning to thank you

120
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,708
for agreeing to my transfer.

121
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:18,208
[HIRATA] If flying gets old,
you can always come back.

122
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,375
[IWATA] The deck crew
definitely got the short straw.

123
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,541
[TOYAMA] Look, I want
to call, same as you.

124
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,583
But ship repairs
are top priority.

125
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,541
We're taking one for the team.

126
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,583
My sweet Akemi!

127
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,916
[ENOMOTO]
Cut the chatter and focus!

128
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,208
[IWATA]
Yes, sir, but, never mind.

129
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,291
Enomoto!

130
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,083
[ENOMOTO]
Hmm?

131
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,958
Hey there, Kodai.

132
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:50,875
What's up?

133
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,166
You need something?

134
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,083
I mean.

135
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,375
Welcome, sir!

136
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,958
If anyone wants to call home.

137
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,875
I can take a shift.

138
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,625
You sure about that, kid?

139
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,416
Oh! Oh, sorry.

140
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,375
Is that an order, Lieutenant?

141
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,625
Enomoto!

142
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,416
[ENOMOTO laughs]

143
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,083
Well, at least that
means one person

144
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,833
will get to make
a call back home.

145
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,125
[YAMAMOTO]
Make that two.

146
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,500
[ENOMOTO]
Hmm?

147
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,500
Isn't that, uh...?

148
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,291
Uh-huh. That's her.

149
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,875
She took out the Gamilan base
with Lieutenant Kodai.

150
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,583
Nice work, pilot.

151
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,000
It looks like our
Chief of Tactical

152
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:37,083
is getting a little less
clueless with the ladies.

153
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,166
What was that?

154
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,541
Kishima! Saeki!

155
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,291
You both just
got hitched, right?

156
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,625
Go call your wives.

157
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,791
Really?

158
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,333
[KISHIMA, SAEKI]
Thank you, sir!

159
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,791
Oh, Captain.

160
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,375
Do you need me for something?

161
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,708
Uh, no.

162
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,291
Looks like you're working.

163
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,291
I won't interrupt.

164
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,541
[SATO]
Oh, no!

165
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,500
What's there to smile about?

166
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,041
So naïve.

167
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,333
[MISAKI] Warning: as the <i>Yamato</i>
approaches the heliopause,

168
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,125
some turbulence is expected.

169
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,166
All crew at
line-crossing ceremony,

170
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,750
please locate the
nearest safety hand rails.

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,458
Oh, is something wrong, Captain?

172
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,250
All is well.

173
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,708
You need something, sir?

174
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:40,250
No, no, I'm just
inspecting the ship.

175
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,625
I won't interrupt.

176
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,666
As you were.

177
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,083
[NAV. OFFICER A]
It's almost my turn.

178
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,000
What do I say?

179
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,166
[NAV. OFFICER B]
It's fine.

180
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,375
They just want
to know you're all right.

181
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,416
So who are you talking to?

182
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Just my mom and my brother.

183
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,208
My dad...

184
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,333
[TOKUGAWA]
Hmm...

185
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,833
Yes, that's right.

186
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,083
He gave his life

187
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,666
during the first battle
with the Gamilan fleet.

188
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,791
My kid was just born!

189
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,208
That was great!

190
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,541
We spent the whole
time on the name!

191
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,625
Ha! But it was worth it!

192
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,958
[TOKUGAWA chuckles]

193
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,000
[MORI]
Chief of Engineering, you're up.

194
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,125
Huh? All right!

195
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,000
Lookey! Grandpa!

196
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,625
[TOKUGAWA chuckles]
Aiko! Hello!

197
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,208
But Tasuke, where's
the rest of the family?

198
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,166
[TASUKE]
Sorry, Dad.

199
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,750
[TOKUGAWA]
Hmm?

200
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,333
They all wanted to talk but they
had to stand in line for food.

201
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,083
Tasuke, I'm hungry, can we eat?

202
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,333
Just a little longer, okay?

203
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,875
Food's gotten more
scarce since you left.

204
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,416
So they're trying the
black market, but it's chaos.

205
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,500
They're what?

206
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,666
I warned all of you
to stay away!

207
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,125
We know.

208
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,041
But we had no choice,
it was either that or starve!

209
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,666
[gasps]

210
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,250
Hey. When will you
be coming home?

211
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,500
[TOKUGAWA] A little less
than a year, sweetheart.

212
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,333
Then I'll bring
back presents, okay?

213
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,625
Tasuke, look after your niece.

214
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,458
When we come back
it's going to be up

215
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,416
to your generation to rebuild.

216
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,250
[TASUKE]
Mm.

217
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:13,958
[TOKUGAWA]
Come on, son.

218
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,250
You have to be strong.

219
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,958
Tasuke, Grandpa's crying!

220
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,083
[SHIMA]
Jiro?

221
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,875
Daisuke!

222
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,958
[SHIMA]
Where's Mom?

223
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,500
[JIRO] She's with
Auntie at the hospital.

224
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,541
She'll be back soon.

225
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,625
Really? Okay.

226
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,541
Well time's short.

227
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,625
And this is going to be my last
message for a long while, okay?

228
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,541
What? You shouldn't say that!

229
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,083
[SHIMA]
Don't be selfish.

230
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,333
Tell Mom I love her.

231
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,375
And that I'll see this
mission all the way through,

232
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,416
just like Dad would have wanted.

233
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,416
And I'll come back to Earth,
no matter what.

234
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,041
Take care of Mom for me, Jiro.

235
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:54,750
You have to.

236
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,833
[JIRO]
Mm.

237
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,250
[SHIMA]
Time's almost up.

238
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,583
[SAORI]
I'm home.

239
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,958
Mom! Daisuke is calling!

240
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,125
[SAORI]
What? Right now?

241
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,375
Hurry! Mom! Hurry.
Get to the screen!

242
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,541
Just a few more seconds!

243
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,125
Mom!

244
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,375
Daisuke!

245
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:21,041
[KODAI] So, you already
made your call back home?

246
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,166
[YAMAMOTO]
No.

247
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,125
[KODAI]
You didn't?

248
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,958
[YAMAMOTO]
There's no need.

249
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,000
Trust me.

250
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,750
It's fine.

251
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,333
Are you...?

252
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,458
I mean, were your parents, uh...

253
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,458
Were they settlers on Mars?

254
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:43,000
My eye color's a dead giveaway.

255
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,958
My grandmother was born on Mars.

256
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,208
When I was born it was chaos.

257
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,291
During the
Second Inner Planet War.

258
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:55,500
After that, we were forced
to resettle on Earth.

259
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,375
Oh...

260
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,875
So you do still have family?

261
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,500
Not now.

262
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,208
Planet bombs got them.

263
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,166
I had one brother who survived.

264
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,041
Then he died while
shooting them down.

265
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,083
So like I said there's no need.

266
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,791
Same goes for me.

267
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:14,875
[YAMAMOTO]
Huh?

268
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,791
[KODAI]
Heh.

269
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,666
[NANBU]
Are you kidding me with this?

270
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,958
[TOKIKO]
She's a good match.

271
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,666
Her family owns Morita
Pharmaceuticals.

272
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,500
Your father knows a high-ranking
official with a daughter,

273
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,875
so we could try her.

274
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:27,625
But I think--

275
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,125
[NANBU]
Mother, stop!

276
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,833
You're in complete denial
of what's going on!

277
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,500
You're the one who
doesn't grasp reality, Son!

278
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,958
You <i>will</i> take over this company!

279
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,583
No, I'm going to
fight for the Earth!

280
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,000
And I'll choose my own wife!

281
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,083
You will come to your senses
and do what I tell you!

282
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,041
[TOKIKO]
Kozo!

283
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:45,916
Look honey.

284
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,541
Just get home safely.

285
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,291
We'll talk then.

286
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,833
[NANBU]
Forgive me, Mom.

287
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,958
But... I already know
who I want to marry.

288
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,416
Nanbu's done,
let's move to the next one.

289
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,625
There's 28 more
who still need to talk.

290
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,291
[AIHARA]
Right on schedule.

291
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,916
By the way, congratulations.

292
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,625
Huh?

293
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:09,583
Your request.

294
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,916
It got approved.

295
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,416
[MISAKI]
Thank you so much!

296
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Good luck.

297
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,666
I'll be listening!

298
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,708
That's great!

299
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,208
What a day.

300
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,625
It was really nice of the
captain to let us all call home,

301
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,750
I'll have to tell him,
"Thank you."

302
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:25,250
Actually, calling
home wasn't his idea.

303
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,416
Who, me?

304
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,291
[ITO] Well I didn't
talk to the captain.

305
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,875
So did you suggest
it to him or not?

306
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,000
Are you interrogating me now?

307
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,666
[ITO]
I didn't see you in the line.

308
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,041
If you're going to take part,
you'd better hurry.

309
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,291
I'm well aware.

310
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,958
Oh and by the way.

311
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,375
Look, you have an admirer.

312
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,208
[MISAKI]
Attention, all crew:

313
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,208
Once the <i>Yamato</i>
crosses the heliopause,

314
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,458
calls to Earth will
no longer be possible.

315
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,750
Anyone wishing to talk...

316
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,791
That guy needs
to learn how to relax.

317
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,000
Hey, you know I don't drink.

318
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,083
[chuckles]

319
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,000
You sure you don't
want to call home?

320
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,125
[KATO] Why, so I can
hear another lecture?

321
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:12,083
My dad will just tell me to quit
and take over the temple again.

322
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,541
[sighs]

323
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,208
My old man is gone.

324
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:20,041
He died like so many, in the
first wave of planet bombs.

325
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,916
Honestly, I hated him.

326
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,666
All he ever did was yell.

327
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,125
It's weird, though.

328
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,291
Now I think about him a lot.

329
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,875
And I'd give anything
to hear that yell again.

330
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,208
Oh well.

331
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,083
[YAMAMOTO]
This is a lot of work.

332
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:42,791
[KODAI]
Well, yeah.

333
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,666
It's a pretty big ship.

334
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,291
Can I ask you something?

335
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,833
[YAMAMOTO]
Huh?

336
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:55,375
[KODAI] Why didn't you volunteer
for the wing from the start?

337
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,250
Well, I tried to.

338
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,166
But the CAG said no.

339
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,000
Putting me in a cockpit
wasn't happening.

340
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,875
[KODAI]
You mean Kato?

341
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,458
Why not?

342
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,583
[YAMAMOTO] You wouldn't know
it from how he struts around,

343
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,458
but when it comes
to life and death,

344
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,750
let's just say he's sensitive.

345
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,416
Just come back alive!

346
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,541
Sir!

347
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,333
Thank you.

348
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,500
[YAMAMOTO]
My take?

349
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,958
He doesn't want me to die.

350
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,541
Not in combat,
the way my brother did.

351
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,583
Kato and my brother
were thick as thieves.

352
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,166
He took it really hard.

353
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,916
[ENOMOTO clears throat]

354
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,583
Well, I'm sorry to
interrupt the bonding session.

355
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,791
But if you don't mind,
Lieutenant,

356
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,291
we could use some
help on the portside.

357
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,833
Very funny.

358
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,000
[YAMAMOTO giggles]

359
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,791
Yes, sir!

360
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,750
No!

361
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,791
You won't get off that easy!

362
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,833
[laughs]

363
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,083
Look Ota.

364
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,833
I told you not to
let my glass get empty.

365
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:14,833
And what do we have here?

366
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,250
Please let me go!

367
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,708
[HARADA] You'd better drink too,
Mister, it'll make this easier.

368
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,958
[sighs]

369
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,791
[MISAKI]
Attention, all crew...

370
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,750
Help me!

371
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,583
Hey, come back here!

372
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:41,000
Huh? Where'd she go?

373
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,458
[HIJIKATA]
You look well.

374
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,666
How's your captain?

375
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,958
Is doctor Sado
taking care of him?

376
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,375
He seems a bit
calmer since Pluto.

377
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,791
That's good.

378
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,375
[MORI] I'm grateful
for you taking care of me

379
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,125
this past year, Admiral.

380
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,666
[HIJIKATA]
Mm. Come back alive.

381
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,791
All right?

382
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,166
Yes, sir.

383
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,375
[knocking]

384
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,791
Come in.

385
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,375
[OKITA]
Can I help you, Chief?

386
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,708
Well, that's my question.

387
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:16,041
Hard to believe
it's already been a year.

388
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,250
[TOKUGAWA]
Talked to Yamazaki.

389
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,541
He said you dropped
by the engine room.

390
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,666
Well, uh, yes.

391
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,458
I don't suppose you
were looking for this? Hmm?

392
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,625
Tokugawa.

393
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,208
[TOKUGAWA] Do you remember
the first ship we ever crewed?

394
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:39,875
[OKITA laughs]
Defense Ship Number 36.

395
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:43,625
She was so tiny they didn't
even give her a proper name.

396
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,625
We were almost too
young to shave.

397
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:49,958
[OKITA laughs]

398
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,041
And how many brave
young sailors have died

399
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:55,375
since then while
we just keep hanging on?

400
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,750
Far too many to count.

401
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:10,000
Truth is... I don't
let myself try.

402
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,875
Lives are more
than just numbers.

403
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,625
As survivors, there's
only one thing to do.

404
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,666
Keep on fighting until we give
the young a reason to hope.

405
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,583
It's the only atonement
for us living this long.

406
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,916
On the backs of all those dead.

407
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,791
[MORI]
Good job on those repairs.

408
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:41,666
Huh?

409
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,208
[MORI]
I saw you out there.

410
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,750
I didn't have
anything else to do.

411
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,041
Why didn't you
make a call to Earth?

412
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,708
[KODAI]
My family's dead.

413
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,208
It's okay.
It's just the way it is.

414
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,208
Did you talk to yours?

415
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,375
I'm like you.

416
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,333
An orphan.

417
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,333
Oh, sorry.

418
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,000
[MORI]
At least, as far as I know.

419
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,625
You see...

420
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,208
I have no memories of my past.

421
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,708
I can recall this last year
with perfect clarity.

422
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,583
But beyond that there's nothing.

423
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,375
I see.

424
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,000
[MISAKI]
Attention, all crew:

425
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,666
In a few minutes the <i>Yamato</i>
will go beyond the heliopause

426
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,333
and the line-crossing
will be complete.

427
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,708
So let's usher in
this new era in style!

428
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:32,958
And we're live!

429
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,166
Hello, listeners!

430
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,208
Welcome to Radio Yamato!

431
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,666
I'm Yuria Misaki,
hostess with the most-ess!

432
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,583
We're kicking things off
with a great first song!

433
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:43,833
An oldie but a goodie,

434
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:47,583
perfect to wrap up the
line-crossing ceremony!

435
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,375
Farewell, Earth.

436
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,875
We'll see you again soon.

437
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,916
Do you hear me, we'll be back!

438
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,041
[SERIZAWA] Glad to hear
you're performing well.

439
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,250
You're the last real
hope our civilization has.

440
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:34,375
I'm counting on you,
Lieutenant Niimi.

441
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,958
[OKITA] We sail
on to interstellar space,

442
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,583
an enemy trap on one side,

443
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:25,166
and on the other,
a furious star.

444
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:30,583
Its mouth a smoldering pit, and
its arms Hell's crimson flames.

445
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,500
We only have one shot.

446
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,500
Will it be enough
to break through this snare

447
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,125
and complete
our unlikely escape?

448
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:40,458
Next time: "Wish Upon a Star."

449
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:42,875
There are 343 days left

450
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:45,375
before the extinction
of the human race.
