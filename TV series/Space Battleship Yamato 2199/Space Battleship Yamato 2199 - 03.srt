Mr. Kodai. Assemble a team
from the deck crew

to know what we landed on.

Hold on,
this thing is autonomous?

Yes, AU09 is the <i>Yamato</i> 's

What is it now, Ganz?

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,250
Sir. There's a message
from Larleta

179
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,666
on the floating continent.

[SHULTZ] The one on Zupist,
planet number five?

00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,875
Yes. And if the message
is to be believed,

00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,500
that Teron ship we were
watching just landed there.

183
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,416
Ridiculous.
With their crude tech,

184
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,666
they're still crawling through
the inner solar system.

There's more, sir.

186
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,416
It would appear that
the sensors at the outpost

187
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,333
have picked up traces
of a Geschtam Jump.

Impossible! Are you
trying to tell me

that they actually jumped?

the message, sir.

[SHULTZ] Mmm. And what about
the floating continents fleet?

192

[GANZ]
It's a resupply base.

There are only
four ships at present.

[LARLETA] Teron weapons are mere
pinpricks for these vessels.

Can't believe we're out

Warp sickness! What a drag!

Is that a thing?

Eh, I just coined it!

[SANADA]
After analyzing the samples,

222
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,750
our best guess is
this environment was imported

from outside our solar system.

224

Seems the Gamilans
moved this whole continent

to Jupiter to help them
re-engineer the earth.

until the main engine
is repaired!

235
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,375
The Type-3 rounds
are physical shells,

so we can fire them immediately!

237

But the Type-3 are
only for short-range!

We can't let them
get that close, sir.

We need the shock cannons!

This power, it's unbelievable.

316
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,458
This weapon is amazing!

317
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,750
Now we'll be able to fight
the Gamilans toe-to-toe!

318
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,791
Heck, who knows, we may even
have the advantage!

319
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,875
There's no denying its power,
but let's not forget

320
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,625
we were only targeting
the Gamilan base.

321
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,833
Yet the Wave Motion Gun
completely obliterated

322
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,166
the whole continent.

323
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,500
Duly noted, XO.
Our mission is not

324
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,166
to exterminate the enemy.

325
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,833
The <i>Yamato</i> 's weaponry
should be used

326
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,916
solely for the purposes
of self-defense.

327
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:11,041
[OKITA] A power that could
destroy the universe itself.

328
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:14,083
Have we attained the
forbidden fire of divinity?

329
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,416
Are we sailing
towards Armageddon?

330
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,833
No, I won't think of that now.

331
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,708
If this is a trial
of human character,

332
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,750
we won't build
our case with words.

333
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,083
Our actions will
speak for themselves.

334
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,541
May our course be true.

335
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,083
[OKITA] The horrific power
of the Wave Motion Gun

336
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:22,416
has damaged the <i>Yamato</i> herself,

337
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,541
while a mysterious distress
call divides the crew.

338
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:28,875
On this mission where one wrong
choice could doom Earth,

339
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,875
how should the ship proceed?

340
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:34,000
Meanwhile, Lieutenant Kodai
finds the traces of a hero

341
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,708
on a frozen satellite,
and offers a requiem

342
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,458
in the vacuum of space.

343
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:41,333
Next time:
"Gravestone on a Frozen Field."

344
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:43,750
There are 363 days left

345
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:46,833
until the extinction
of the human race.
