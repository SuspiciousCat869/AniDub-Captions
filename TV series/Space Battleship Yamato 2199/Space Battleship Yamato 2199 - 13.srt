161
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,250
Are you basing that on evidence?

162
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,291
There's nothing I can point to.

163
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:48,041
I suppose you could
just call it a hunch.

164
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,166
I see. It runs in
the family, then.

165
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,416
I was just saying that I agree
with you, Lieutenant Kodai.

166
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,166
Here's a thought. We could use
the warp engine's subsystems

167
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,958
as a transducer to convert a
signal beyond normal space.

168
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,541
We can use the dimensional fault
data to set the parameters,

169
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,291
and see what bounces back.

170
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,083
It would be like firing
a sonar ping

171
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,541
across the dimensional
phase boundary.

172
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,041
Dimensional active
sonar! Brilliant!

173
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,208
That would tell us if a ship

174
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,041
is still hiding in
another dimension!

175
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,041
Yeah, but that's a
double-edged sword.

176
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,041
Firing a ping from our ship
would reveal our position, too.

177
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,916
If you allow your
fear to paralyze you

178
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,833
then you'll never take action.

179
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,875
I suggest flying a
Seagull to patrol

180
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,125
for hostiles instead, sir.

181
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,750
You mean with the new
subspace sonar buoys?

182
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,625
Yes. That could basically
work the same way, right?

183
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,875
They would show us

184
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,666
if something's hiding
in another dimension.

185
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,791
Theoretically, yes.
But trying to navigate

186
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,666
a Seagull through all this
interstellar medium

187
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,916
would be far too dangerous.
It's a death sentence!

188
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,500
Better than risking
the whole crew!

189
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,083
It's a way to search
without revealing

190
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,416
the <i>Yamato</i> 's position!

191
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
And which unlucky pilot
are you going to send out

192
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,208
into that minefield, Kodai?

193
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,458
I'll fly it myself!

194

00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,708
Niimi's correct.

198
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,000
It would be far too dangerous
just to follow a hunch.

Tube Three. Tube Four.

320
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,375
Open fire!

321
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,208
[KODAI]
Seagull to <i>Yamato</i> .

322
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,541
I'll use the buoys to send you

323
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,541
estimated emergence points
for the torpedoes,

324
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,041
so you can shoot them down.

325
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:18,833
Listen to me!

326
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:19,875
Let's try it.

327
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,375
Prepare weapons to intercept.

328
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,041
Understood.
Prepare to intercept!

329
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,000
[KITANO]
Preparing now, sir!

330
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,250
[TOYAMA]
Looks like it's working.

331
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,625
We found them!

332
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:38,583
[IWATA]
Two torpedoes!

333
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,125
Transmit to the <i>Yamato</i> .

334
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,291
[IWATA]
Roger!

335
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,041
Target coordinates received
and entered, sir.

336
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,291
Intercept torpedoes.

337
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,250
Yes sir, firing now!

338
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,708
[FLAKEN grunts] They anticipated
our firing angle?

339
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:16,750
[HEINI]
But how?

340
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:20,458
--[ping]
--[HEINI gasps] More sonar?

341
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,500
Tenacious little vermin,
aren't they.

342
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,916
They may be able to see us,

343
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,916
but we're still in
another dimension.

344
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,291
They won't be able
to touch us here.

345
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,500
[gasps]

346
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,833
[FLAKEN]
So that's their trick.

347
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:38,833
[IWATA]
Whoa.

348
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,416
What is that thing?

349
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,625
Something else just emerged from
the phase boundary, lieutenant!

350
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,833
Where is it?

351
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:45,625
[IWATA]
Close!

352
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,166
Okay, got it. Turning now.

353
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,291
Tell me when you have a visual.

354
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,291
Ah-ha. Gotcha!

355
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,791
Heh.

356
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,500
[KODAI]
Seagull to <i>Yamato</i> .

357
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,583
We've found an apparent
enemy probe behind you,

358
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:06,750
at four o'clock.

359
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,750
Sending you the coordinates now.

360
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,500
If you can knock it out,
you'll blind them.

361
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,958
Evidently recklessness
runs in the family, as well.

362
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,583
[SANADA]
Prepare to fire!

363
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,416
[KITANO]
Inputting coordinates!

364
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,625
Locked on target!

365
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,666
All right, fire
the shock cannons!

366
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,458
[gasps] They got us.

367
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,166
[KODAI]
Approaching the <i>Yamato</i> .

368
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,750
Pre-landing check.

369
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,583
Preparing Seagull to dock.

370
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,458
Navigation, as soon as he's
secure in the hangar,

371
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,708
get us out of here at
maximum possible speed.

372
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,041
Once we're clear of this rubble

373
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,166
we're going to warp
to lose them.

374
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,375
No sign of them on radar.

375
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,208
Then those slippery mongrels
must have already jumped.

376
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,500
What's our next move, sir?

377
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,708
For now, we're going
to let them go.

378
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,625
You sure, Captain?

379
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,541
Good hunters don't
need to chase.

380
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,291
We'll pick up their
scent again eventually.

381
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,541
[OKITA grunting]

382
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,208
Hey, Captain.

383
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,625
Hello, Kodai.

384
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,541
This is quite the
welcoming party.

385
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,166
Is the ship all right?

386
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,541
It was close, but we made
it through, Captain.

387
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,166
Thanks to the moxie of
some of our young sailors.

388
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,833
You pushed the envelope a bit
too far, if you ask me.

389
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:51,708
[HARADA, KODAI gasp]

390
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,166
But despite your disobedience,

391
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,541
Sanada's gonna let you
off the hook this time.

392
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,916
Don't let that stern
look of his fool ya.

393
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,333
He's not a bad guy.

394
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,208
Oh, I see.

395
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,708
[NIIMI]
You didn't want him

396
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,833
to risk his life out there
in the Seagull, did you?

397
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,958
That's why you didn't
agree to his plan

398
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,625
even though he had a point.

399
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,125
But he believed he was doing
the right thing, for all of us,

400
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,708
and acted anyway.

401
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:19,083
And what would he have done,
if he were in command?

402
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,708
[gasps] Well, sir.

403
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,250
It's just a guess,

404
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:26,500
but I think he would've done
the exact same thing.

405
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,250
[SANADA]
I think you're right.

406
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:08,666
[OKITA] A siren's song lures
ships to their doom,

407
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,208
and a mysterious prowler
lurks in the shadows,

408
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:15,208
making mischief with
her victims' memories.

409
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:19,291
The <i>Yamato</i> is shipwrecked, but
what has happened to her crew?

410
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:22,916
Can Kodai and Mori make sense
of the madness they see?

411
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,041
Next time:
The Whisper of the Witch.

412
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:32,083
There are 310 left before the
extinction of the human race.
