[MISAKI]
Today, on Yamato Radio Theater,

2
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:44,833
a request from a crewmember

3
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,500
going under the
name Shiro Shinta.

4
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:50,333
It's a famous tale from
the late 21st century,

5
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:53,416
called <i>The Heart</i>
<i>of Agent Number Nine.</i>

6
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,458
[MISAKI] In the early
days of life on Mars,

7
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,416
before there
were towns at all,

8
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,416
a single observation
post stood alone

9
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,000
at the edge of Mare Sirenum.

10
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,250
No one ever came to visit
this forgotten tower

11
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,458
in the silent, barren land,

12
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:12,458
where a lone young man
spent his days keeping watch,

13
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,000
much like a lighthouse
keeper of old.

14
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,083
He had no name.

15
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,500
In his solitude,
he didn't need one.

16
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,666
He only had his number.

17
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,750
[ANALYZER]
Transplanting visual sensors

18
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,916
from Gamiloid A to Gamiloid B.

19
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,041
[ANALYZER]
Transplant successful.

20
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,333
[SANADA] The three Gamiloid
soldiers we recovered

21
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,375
from Enceladus all
share the same design,

22
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,666
and what we
consider orthodox AI.

23
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,083
We think they're automata.

24
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,166
What's that mean?

25
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,541
[MORI]
Like mechanical dolls, right?

26
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,125
[SANADA]
By running a massive number

27
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,083
of simple programs in parallel,
it can perform complex actions,

28
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:05,000
replicating many
human capabilities.

29
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,666
They share the same
fundamental architecture

30
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,791
as our own artificial
intelligence systems.

31
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,458
Their programming
tells us Gamilans

32
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,750
use the same mathematics.

33
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,000
And understand physics
much like we do.

34
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,458
This means our cultures
should be capable

35
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,833
of at least some communication.

36
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,583
When encountering an
alien civilization in space,

37
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,375
this has long been
theorized to be important.

38
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,458
Vital, when it comes
down to matters of war.

39
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,416
It means we can play shogi
by the same rules.

40
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,875
And that's a start.

41
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,416
Yeah, I guess.

42
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,583
So, could you pull any useful
data from their hard drives?

43
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,791
Like intel, that might help us?

44
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:41,583
[SANADA]
Hmm.

45
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,791
Well, we tried.

46
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,875
But two of them were
damaged beyond repair.

47
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,791
The third unit is still intact.

48
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,875
But we can't get
access to its data.

49
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,833
As far as we can tell it
would only be accessible

50
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,708
from a Gamilan terminal.

51
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,750
It sounds like we've struck out.

52
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,291
But there is another option.

53
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,500
We turn it back on.

54
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,000
And then we ask it to talk.

55
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,416

00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,250

[ALTER]
A... A-Ana-Ana... Analyzer?

62
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,791
[ANALYZER] You are a rebooted,
alternative configuration

63
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,875
of an alien civilization's
servant android.

64
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:35,916
Suggestion!

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,125
I can call you Alter!

66
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,666
[ALTER]

[MORI] No enemies
detected in the vicinity.

69
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,166
[ANALYZER] Sir, permission
to resume analyzing Alter?

70
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,125
Yes, go ahead.

71
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,750
[ANALYZER]
Aye-aye!

72
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,750
Analyzer seems to
be enjoying himself.

73
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,375
Yeah, I'm sure he is.

74
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,291
He's finally got another
robot to talk to now.

[NIIMI]
Hello, Analyzer.

90
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,708
Am I interrupting
some machine gossip?

91
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,416
[ANALYZER]
Negative.

92
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,666
I do not gossip.

93
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,333
I am currently
teaching Alter to speak.

94
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,916
Oh, is that a fact?

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,666
But you've already figured out
how to link operating systems,

96
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,166
so why not just upload
a dictionary to it?

97
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,833
[ANALYZER] Vocabulary alone
does not equal mastery.

98
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,375
To understand linguistic
structure and concepts,

99
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,291
a large number of
exchanges are required.

100
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,333
In addition...

101
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,041
Yes, I know.
For security reasons,

102
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,375
you can't connect it
to the ship's network.

103
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,458
So I was right, we should
have investigated further.

104
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,625
This still doesn't tell me
if we could colonize.

105
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,791
[MISAKI] One day at
the observation post,

106
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,291
an old mechanical engineer

107
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:07,083
named Houdin arrived with
a girl named Eve at his side.

108
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,166
For Number Nine,
this led to an encounter

109
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,708
he found nothing
short of magical.

110
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,416
Hearing a sound in the distance,

111
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,083
Number Nine followed
it to the new Martian sea,

112
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,958
and found the girl
sitting on a rock,

113
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,375
singing with a haunting voice.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,416
[ALTER]
Who are you?

115
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
[MISAKI]
Hearing his approach,

116
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,166
the girl stopped
and turned to him.

117
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,125
"Who are you?" she asked.

118
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,875
[MISAKI] "And what are you
doing all the way out here?"

119
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:07,208
[ALTER]
Yesterday, I met a goddess.

120
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,416
[ANALYZER]
A goddess?

121
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,458
[ALTER]
The goddess of this vessel.

122
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,916
[ANALYZER]
Can you please elaborate?

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,916
[ALTER] The goddess asked,
"Who are you?"

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,791
I answered, "I am Alter."

125
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,208
"No," she replied.

126
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:26,208
"Your identity.
I am not asking for your name."

127
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,958
[ANALYZER]
Lieutenant Mori, perhaps?

128
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,833
Or Lieutenant Niimi?

129
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,708
Negative.

130
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,958
That seems unlikely.

131
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,250
[ALTER] Can you answer
this question, Analyzer?

132
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,083
Who are you?

133
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,458

00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,750
Just like anybody else.

165
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,500
[MAINTENANCE]
Open port side hatch.

166
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,208
[IWATA]
Aye-aye.

167
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,500
Let's do this.

168
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,583
[MAINTENANCE] Guidance team,
prepare to pull them in.

169
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,708
Okay!

170
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,250
Looks good!

171
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,750
[ANALYZER]
Huh? Alter?

172
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,541
[SANADA]
Hmm?

173
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,041
[IWATA]
Huh?

174
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,291
Toyama.

175
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,083
Are you seeing an error
on the control display?

176
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,125
[TOYAMA]
The screen just went blank!

177
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,791
[IWATA]
What?

178
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:54,833
Force release!

179
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,791
[SID VOICE]
Executing command.

180
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,541
What the hell?

181
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,958
[IWATA]
Look out!

182
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,333
[YAMAMOTO]
Get her steady!

183
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,833
I'm trying!

184
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,333
What is wrong with you?

185
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,000
You've could've
gotten us killed!

186
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,208
[IWATA]
I don't know what happened.

187
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,958
We can't explain it.

188
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,041
That crane.

189
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,083
Doesn't it have
an auto-control program?

190
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,625
And we were using it.

191
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,291
But then something went wrong.

192
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,041
My control display went blank
and the crane just went haywire.

193
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,958
If there's an issue, it's
supposed to shut itself down.

194
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,875
I've never seen anything
like this before.

195
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:36,958
Morons!

196
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,791
Just because it never
happened before

197
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,500
doesn't mean it
won't happen today!

198
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,000
That's why you're
both down there,

199
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,666
in case the machines
do screw it up!

200
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,125
Yes, sir!

201
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,000
No excuses.

202
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,541
I'm sorry.

203
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,791
We let you all down.

204
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:50,666
It's fine.

205
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,625
We can see you're on top of it.

206
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:53,416
Right?

207
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,250
[YAMAMOTO]
Uh. Yeah.

208
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,333
Looks like you talked to Alter.

209
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,458
By your own sub-network before
the accident, is that right?

210
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,708
[ANALYZER]
Correct.

211
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,333
There was a very minor
lag in the data relay

212
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,750
between the hangar equipment
and the ship's mainframe.

213
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,833
But those
nanoseconds were vital.

214
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,375
And that's what caused
the dock crane to malfunction.

215
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,541
[ANALYZER]
I am sorry for the issue.

216
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,000
Your sessions with Alter may be
stressing the ship's processors

217
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,875
in ways we didn't expect.

218
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,583
So if this continues, I'll have
to reformat you as a safeguard.

219
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:29,208
[ANALYZER]
That would be...

220
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,250
...the correct and
logical decision to make.

221
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,625
Analyzer.

222
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,083
I'm going to put a
hold on the Alter project.

223
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,916
For now you're forbidden
from coming here

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,083
or communicating with
Alter by your sub-network.

225
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,458
Let us keep
an eye on it for now.

226
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,083
You got it?

227
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,500
[ANALYZER]
Aye-aye.

228
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,875
[MISAKI] The old engineer
sent Eve back to their ship,

229
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,083
and Agent Number Nine
desired nothing more

230
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,750
than to see her again.

231
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,708
Despite his prior solitude,

232
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:13,750
this was the first time in his
life he truly knew loneliness.

233
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,958
So he decided to venture out to
the ship, and see Eve once more.

234
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,750
He felt, with a sudden
conviction in his heart,

235
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:24,291
this was the only way he
could learn who he truly was.

236
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,583
[ANALYZER]
XO, I learned something

237
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,583
from my communication
with Alter.

238
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,916
[SANADA]
Hmm?

239
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,916
[ANALYZER] The Gamiloid
machines are just like me.

240
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,416
That so?

241
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:54,375
[ANALYZER] Alter asked me
to define who I am.

242
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,291
[SANADA]
What did you say?

243
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,416
[ANALYZER]
I said a friend.

244
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,250
[SANADA]
A friend, huh?

245
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,958
I think that's a good answer.

246
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,375
[ALTER]
Where is the goddess?

247
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,458
[MISAKI]
Huh?

248
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,166
[ANALYZER]
Computer, what is happening?

249
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,791
[MORI] The lock to the
main lab has been destroyed.

250
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,750
Looks like that
Gamiloid's missing.

251
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,791
Send in security, now!

252
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,083
Weapons use is approved,
so shoot it down if you have to!

253
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,041
[SHIMA] Ship has moved
to Alert Status One.

254
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,625
Repeat: Ship has moved
to Alert Status One.

255
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,875
Recovered Gamiloid has escaped
main lab on deck four,

256
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,541
and is assumed to be
hiding somewhere on ship.

257
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,666
Security teams are
to capture or destroy.

258
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,541
[SECURITY B]
Is that it?

259
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,750
[SECURITY A]
Freeze!

260
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,291
[SHIMA] Security are
to capture or destroy.

261
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,375
[SECURITY A]
Don't move. Stay right there!

262
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,750
Target spotted!

263
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,208
In pursuit on
port side of deck three!

264
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,583
[ANALYZER] Alter wanted
to know how to define

265
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,916
who he was, as well.

266
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,125
He likely believes
if he finds the goddess,

267
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,291
he will resolve that question.

268
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,375
Wait, what goddess?

269
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,166
[ANALYZER] Alter said
that he had encountered

270
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,625
the goddess of this ship.

271
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,416
And I have learned
one additional,

272
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,791
important fact
about the Gamiloids,

273
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,583
which I believe we must
take into consideration.

274
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,458
[HOSHINA]
Don't let it escape!

275
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,166
Close the bulkheads!

276
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,333
[HOSHINA]
Don't move!

277
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,333
Huh?!

278
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:10,625
Mori.

279
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:11,958
Where's the Gamiloid now?

280
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,458
[MORI]
In the ducts on deck two.

281
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,958
Looks like it's moving
toward the bow.

282
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,583
[HOSHINA] We're heading
for that sealed room, right?

283
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,250
The automatic guidance
systems leading us

284
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,875
to Iscandar are housed in there.

285
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,416
Do you think
that's what it's after?

286
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,333
There it is!

287
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,541
We have to stop it!

288
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,291
Open fire, now!

289
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,250
[ALTER]
Enemy.

290
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,583
Terror.

291
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:40,916
Alive.

292
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,166
Goddess!

293
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,708
That's the second
turret loading room.

294
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,875
Looks like it just went inside!

295
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:57,833
[ITO]
Well?

296
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,625
[HOSHINA]
No good.

297
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,708
It's locked from inside.

298
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:00,750
Team to bridge!

299
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,166
We need you
to override this lock!

300
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,000
Stand by to open fire.

301
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,125
[AIHARA]
This is the bridge.

302
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,083
The Gamiloid infiltrated
our system and locked us out.

303
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,666
It's going to take us some time
to make our way back in.

304
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,708
Tsch!

305
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,500
[ANALYZER]
I can assist.

306
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,458
AU09, perfect timing.

307
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,958
Come open this door.

308
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,500
[ANALYZER] First, your team
must holster their weapons.

309
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,875
[ITO]
Why?

310
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,000
[ANALYZER] I do not want
him to think we are enemies.

311
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,375
Have you blown a fuse?

312
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,958
Of course that
thing's our enemy!

313
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,750
[MISAKI] We do not fire
on unarmed prisoners.

314
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:30,916
What do you mean?

315
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,250
A prisoner?

316
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,583
Don't be stupid.

317
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,708
That thing's just a
big hunk of metal and wires.

318
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:36,958
It thinks and feels.

319
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,250
So it should be treated
as a prisoner like us!

320
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,500
Wait, feel?

321
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,875
So now it has a heart?

322
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,791
I thought it was an automaton.

323
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,250
Isn't that what you've
been calling that thing

324
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,375
in your reports, XO?

325
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,666
It's true the Gamiloids
are automata that function

326
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,833
through a massive array
of response programs.

327
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:52,916
So, that much we know.

328
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,041
Exactly.

329
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:54,916
Like I said.

330
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,791
They're just brainless machines.

331
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,333
[SANADA]
However...

332
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,250
Some would say the human brain
is essentially no different.

333
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,708
A network of parallel processors
programmed by our DNA.

334
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,583
Your attitude is a common one.

335
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,250
You want to believe that
our consciousness is special.

336
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,500
And could never be
achieved by circuitry.

337
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:15,000
And yet...
your belief is irrelevant.

338
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,666
You cannot actually
prove that's the case.

339
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,750
[ITO]
Hmph!

340
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,791
You've got a real way
with words, sir.

341
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,208
[ANALYZER] I have retaken
control of security.

342
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,291
Bottom line.

343
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,041
You do not fire
unless I say you can.

344
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,125
[ITO]
All right, XO, you're the boss.

345
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,708
[ANALYZER]
Opening door now.

346
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,583
[HOSHINA]
Misaki?

347
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,666
[ANALYZER]
XO...

348
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,208
When Alter is found,

349
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,500
I recommend immediate forced
shut down with maximum caution.

350
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,250
[ITO]
Oh yeah, and why's that?

351
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,291
For safety.

352
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,583
So he won't blow himself up.

353
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,875
[ANALYZER] Gamiloids have a
root program that is designed

354
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,416
to self-destruct if isolated

355
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,000
and surrounded by what they
perceive to be their enemies.

356
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,916
Go! Just be careful!

357
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,250
Yes, sir!

358
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,500
Analyzer, let's go.

359
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,416
One question.

360
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,583
What's your take on it?

361
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:23,375
You don't really think that
machine has a heart, do you?

362
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,541
[SANADA]
To be honest: At the moment,

363
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,041
it's not even clear to me
whether <i>you</i> have a heart.

364
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,666
There are some in our species
who lack all empathy,

365
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,541
and only fake it
to get what they want.

366
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,250
Perhaps you're
simulating your humanity.

367
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,958
It's exiting the ship!

368
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,375
To the upper deck, sir!

369
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,041
I think it's making its
way toward the bridge

370
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,541
from the outside!

371
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,875
[OKITA]
We can't allow the Gamiloid

372
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,708
to reach the automatic
guidance system.

373
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,500
We'll destroy it if we must.

374
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,041
[ANALYZER]
Shell block destroyed.

375
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,500
Infiltrating kernel.

376
00:19:51,125 --> 00:20:00,083
[ALTER]
Dog. Cat. Alive. Goddess. Death.

377
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:05,541
Friend. Friend. Friend...

378
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,750
[ANALYZER] Gamiloid Alternative
forced shut down complete.

379
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,250
Mainframe reformatted.

380
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,416
Reboot impossible.

381
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,875
[SANADA]
Recover its task log.

382
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,333
[ANALYZER]
Roger that.

383
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,791
[SANADA]
I've completed the analysis.

384
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,916
There's nothing in
Alter's task log to indicate

385
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,166
the self-destruct defense
program was activated.

386
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,458
[ANALYZER]
Therefore...

387
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:07,666
Yes. If nothing else,

388
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,875
he believed he still had at
least one friend on this ship.

389
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,625
You performed
your duty well, Analyzer.

390
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,250
[MISAKI]
Eve's skin was peeled away,

391
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,208
her joints ratcheted apart,

392
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,750
revealing the intricate
system of gears and silicon

393
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:32,875
that had been hidden inside.

394
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,625
From the tower's window, Number
Nine watched in perfect silence

395
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,666
as her body sank
into the Mare Sirenum.

396
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,416
[MISAKI] "I no longer
feel pity for that doll.

397
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,750
For her plight is not
some unfathomable mystery."

398
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,875
"Because I know I am
also one," he thought.

399
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,875
"A servant. A doll.
A creation of Houdin."

400
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,500
[MISAKI]
And then Number Nine thought.

401
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:06,208
Alone in his small room,
in the observation post.

402
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,833
He thought that ultimately,

403
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,791
whether or not that
beautiful doll had a heart,

404
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,708
he did not need to know.

405
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,375
It was not his
question to answer.

406
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:20,958
[MISAKI] And then he thought,
as Martian day turned to night:

407
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:24,375
The fact that I do have
a heart is a secret.

408
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:28,000
A secret that
belongs only to me.

409
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,583
[OKITA] The <i>Yamato</i> plunges
through a dimensional gap

410
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,375
into a ship graveyard,

411
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:25,541
a cruel space devoid
of life or salvation.

412
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:29,125
But in that bleakness falls
the shadow of an enemy ship.

413
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:31,625
Will they aid,
or impede each other?

414
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:34,000
Will stranded crews
work together,

415
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:37,083
or doom them all to death?

416
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:40,166
Next time:
"Graveyard of the Universe."

417
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,333
There are 325 days left

418
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:45,208
before the extinction
of the human race.
