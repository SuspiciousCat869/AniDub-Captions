00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:55,772
[OKITA] Captain's Log: On the
planet known as Leptapoda,

2
00:01:55,855 --> 00:01:58,650
where our ship
landed to resupply,

3
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:01,319
we learned a shocking fact.

4
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:04,114
The <i>Yamato</i> 's ultimate
destination, Iscandar,

5
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:06,950
a world we had long viewed
as a pure symbol of hope,

6
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:09,577
is actually a twin
planet with Gamilas,

7
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:12,038
the home of our enemies.

8
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:14,749
The two civilizations
share a strong connection,

9
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:18,420
about which we
were not informed.

10
00:02:18,503 --> 00:02:20,755
The Gamilas Empire
reveres Iscandar

11
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:24,050
as a sacred object of worship.

12
00:02:24,134 --> 00:02:26,302
We have met with a former
high-ranking official

13
00:02:26,386 --> 00:02:29,305
from Gamilas, Admiral Ditz,
who had been imprisoned

14
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:32,892
on Leptapoda for his part
in an attempted coup.

15
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:34,519
He and his comrades
were rebelling

16
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:36,604
against the current
leader of Gamilas,

17
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:38,565
meaning we had a common enemy.

18
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:40,442
But quickly putting
aside our difference

19
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:44,029
to pursue full collaboration
proved to be impossible.

20
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,622
[OKITA] However, we did
gain several useful pieces

21
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:58,001
of information about
Gamilas, and their people.

22
00:02:58,084 --> 00:03:01,004
Their leader's name
is Lord Abelt Desler.

23
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:02,464
He has ruled over his vast,

24
00:03:02,547 --> 00:03:04,966
interstellar empire
with an iron fist,

25
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,970
using terrible methods
to keep control.

26
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:11,765
After our meeting,
Admiral Ditz and his forces

27
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:13,641
headed out to the
other prison planets,

28
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:16,519
intending to free
those inmates as well.

29
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:25,070
[OKITA] And so, with
our divergent goals,

30
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:27,572
we were forced to part ways.

31
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:39,125
[OKITA] But even though they
would not fight alongside us,

32
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:44,714
they did agree to leave
a liaison on our ship.

33
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:47,884
I choose to believe this will
lead to further cooperation,

34
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:51,805
and a future of greater hope.

35
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:53,473
And we learned something else.

36
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:54,808
Our Chief of Operations,

37
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:58,061
who was kidnapped by
the enemy, is alive.

38
00:03:58,144 --> 00:04:00,730
According to a Gamilan
woman named Elisa Domel,

39
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:04,317
her people have mistaken
Lieutent Mori for Yurisha and--

40
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:16,788
Not yet. Just a little more.

41
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:24,129
[DESLER]
Noble Yurisha Iscandar,

42
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:26,297
welcome to Great Gamilas.

43
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:29,217
It is a true honor
to have you here.

44
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:32,971
Don't tell me you've forgotten
me after all these years.

45
00:04:33,054 --> 00:04:35,223
I'm not sure I could bear it.

46
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,521
All right, guys,
what's goin' on here?

47
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:43,481
[KATO] She keeps insisting
I let her get on board

48
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:44,816
one of the Falcons.

49
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,443
[MELDA] And he keeps
telling me that as the CAG,

50
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:47,277
he can't allow it.

51
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,029
Of course I can't! Tch.

52
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:52,073
Melda, what is this
mission of yours, again?

53
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:55,452
[MELDA] I'm here as a liaison
between my side and yours.

54
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:57,704
[KODAI] And do your liaison
duties have anything to do

55
00:04:57,787 --> 00:04:59,748
with one of the
<i>Yamato</i> 's fighters?

56
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:00,749
[MELDA]
No.

57
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:02,292
Well, there's
your answer then.

58
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,210
All right. I'll obey.

59
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:07,422
Ugh! So you'll listen to
Kodai but not me, huh?

60
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:08,757
[SHINOHARA]
Respectfully, sirs,

61
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,885
don't we have something
she can fly?

62
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:15,722
Come on. How 'bout
the one I flew at Balun?

63
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:17,140
Oh, yeah!

64
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:18,975
[MELDA]
What's he talking about?

65
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:20,643
You can take this from here.

66
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:22,937
Whoa! What? You're leaving?

67
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,648
[ARMAMENTS CM A] Squad Five,
requesting status report.

68
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:27,025
After briefing complete,

69
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:30,612
begin loading procedures
for secondary armaments.

70
00:05:31,946 --> 00:05:34,699
Now I see. So you
captured a ship.

71
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:36,910
Tell me, are you really
sure you'll be willing

72
00:05:36,993 --> 00:05:39,162
to fire at your own people?

73
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:42,791
[MELDA]
That will depend on your people.

74
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:44,334
If I'm not mistaken,

75
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:47,128
the <i>Yamato</i> 's mission
is to reach Iscandar,

76
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:51,132
not to go to Gamilas
and pick another fight.

77
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,967
It's your choice.

78
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:57,180
Will you let your desire to
destroy us divert your ship?

79
00:05:57,263 --> 00:05:59,140
I know how much
you want revenge.

80
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:01,017
That's not true.

81

[YURISHA]
Not anymore, you mean.

Right? Now you don't?

Well, I'm glad
you're butting in,

'cause there's
actually something

I've been wanting to
ask you, Princess.

87

Stop it!

88
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:19,327
Don't ever point your finger
at an Iscandarian again!

[YURISHA chuckles]

90
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:23,123
Thank you, but it's fine.

91
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:24,874
I really don't mind it.

92
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,418
But, Your Grace.

93
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:28,920
Why didn't you tell us
that Iscandar and Gamilas

94
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:30,005
were in the same orbit?

95
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:32,173
That's one hell of an omission!

96
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:35,593
If we had, would you still
have made the journey?

97
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:37,846
Or would you have
been too afraid?

98
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,725
[SHIMA]
What if we had known?

99
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:43,685
Would we have rolled the dice?

100
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:45,020
Could we have persevered
through all this,

101
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:47,272
knowing what was
at the other end?

102
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:50,358
I think we made it this far
because we didn't know.

103
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:52,485
Either way, you gotta
admit it's a shock.

104
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:56,531
I mean, twin planets?

105
00:06:56,614 --> 00:06:59,534
Melda says it's likely that
Mori's on Gamilas now,

106
00:06:59,617 --> 00:07:03,038
being welcomed as
Iscandarian royalty.

107
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:06,666
So at least they're probably
treating her well.

108
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,209
[KODAI]
Yeah, maybe.

109
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:10,462
If they still believe
she's Yurisha.

It's so big. And blue.

did you ask your crew
about that other matter?

Huh? Yeah, it's in the works.

I'll be honest with ya, kid.

Sometimes I just
don't get women.

You really are cute, Melda.

328
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,901
Thank you. You honor me.

I agree, you are cute.

You don't get to say it!

Can we get back to
your love life now?

Stop ignoring me!

Well?

00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:07,452
Is it true you have
someone waiting for you

When I get home,

there's something
important I need to say.

338

What, like a love confession?

At ship time 1100 hours,

I believe it's premature
to use it now.

I don't mind that, Talan.

If I may speak freely, sir.

This facility and its
project were designed

352
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:05,343
for when we moved the capital,

353
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:07,721
and not as a tool to use
against the <i>Yamato</i> .

[MORI] The <i>Yamato</i> 's coming.
They're still alive.

The Terons have journeyed
a long way to get here.

359
00:19:21,735 --> 00:19:22,944
We need to give them a greeting

360
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:26,573
that's befitting of such
a momentous voyage.

I'll let you stay here
and watch it unfold.

[OKITA]
Fellow sailors.

365
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:41,880
Earth is now 160,000
light-years behind us.

366
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:45,300
But as I see it, that's just
a meaningless number now.

367
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:48,553
We've shown we can get
here and we can go back.

368
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:52,891
Earth is right behind us,
awaiting your return.

369
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:54,642
The long road nears its end.

370
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,895
Very soon we will reach
our final objective

in the Salezar System.

372

But as we now know,

the enemy's home planet
is there as well.

374

At its end, this path diverges.

375

There is hope, and there is war.

376
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:09,824
But we will choose
the path to Iscandar

377
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,785
because that is where hope lies.

Salvation is why we were sent.

The Earth is behind us,

waiting for us to
return with that hope.

We will fulfill our mission
and give humankind a future.

The <i>Yamato</i> will now
enter warp navigation.

This should be our last major
warp before reaching Iscandar.
