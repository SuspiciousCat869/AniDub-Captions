1
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,416
[SHIMA] This is the <i>Yamato</i> 's
current location.

2
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
Our next warp should take us out
here, past the protostar cluster

3
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,250
that marks the edge
of the Milky Way.

4
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,875
Forty-one kiloparsecs
separate our galaxy

5
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,750
and the Large Magellanic Cloud.

6
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:56,916
In other words,

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,916
we still have over
130,000 more light years

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,166
of unknown space ahead of us.

9
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,958
[OKITA]
Mm.

10
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,208
We're expecting far fewer
run-ins with the enemy

11
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,750
once we leave the Milky Way.

12
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,291
Oh, what makes you think that?

13
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,541
It's a guess.

14
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,375
When you consider the
requirements for life,

15
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:14,916
it's a numbers game.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,125
The Milky Way is larger, with
many more potential systems,

17
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,500
meaning it's most probable

18
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,250
the Gamilas System
is in our own galaxy.

19
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,666
[NANBU]
Yeah, that makes sense to me.

20
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,000
[OKITA]
Hm...

21
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,541
[KODAI]
I'll leave the math to you guys,

22
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,041
I'll just be glad to have them
off our backs for a while.

23
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,583
I'm shocked you're so relaxed.

24
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,333
Is this all a game to you?

25
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,000
[gasps]

26
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,208
Hey, what's your problem?

27
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,416
My problem is you're
losing your edge, Kodai.

28
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,458
[KODAI]
"Losing my edge"?

29
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,458
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,375
I work every bit
as hard as you do.

31
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,791
You're being too idealistic, and
forgetting who the enemy is!

32
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,833
Oh, I see, so this
is about Melda!

33
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,958
[SHIMA]
The enemy Gamilan pilot, yeah!

34
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,166
[KODAI] And what does she
have to do with any of this?

35
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,916
Everything, because
if you respect her

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,458
you must believe her!

37
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,875
You think we fired first and
started the war, just admit it!

38
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,500
Don't put words in
my mouth, Shima!

39
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,791
You aren't denying it!

40
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,166
[NANBU]
Guys, just breathe, okay?

41
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,833
[SHIMA, KODAI]
Shut the hell up, Nanbu!

42
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,125
Enough, you idiots!

43
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:04,791
[BOTH grunt]

44
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,041
[BOTH gasp]

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,833
[DR. SADO] Your blood pressure's
a little high, Captain.

46
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,750
[OKITA]
Duly noted.

47
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,333
[DR. SADO]
I heard about the drama.

48
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,666
The young ones have tempers
like sticks of dynamite.

49
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,791
Ya better watch
your own fuse, too.

50
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:26,041
[OKITA chuckles]
You can always read my mind.

51
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,791
[KODAI]
Curse that old man.

52
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,333
[KODAI]
"You lack the self-awareness

53
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,250
required of an officer."

54
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,333
This is how they punish
little grade school kids!

55
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,583
Hey.

56
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,833
Can we wrap this up and
move to the next one?

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,708
[SHIMA]
I'm done.

58
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,791
[KODAI] I hear they're offering
a "Milky Way Lunch"

59
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,041
in the galley.
Limited time only!

60
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,500
Wanna check it out?

61
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,958
[sighs] Whatever.

62
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,708
[TOKUGAWA] Hm...
You told all that to Shima?

63
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,416
[YAMAZAKI]
Yeah.

64
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,416
I see.

65
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,958
That explains why
he was so upset.

66
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,250
So, do you regret telling him?

67
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,833
I don't.

68
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,916
He's Daigo Shima's son, he
can handle the hard truth.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,541
He just needs more time
to come to terms with it.

70
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,000
At least, that's how I see it.

71
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,583
[YABU] I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

72
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,833
Those higher ups can be
surprisingly fragile.

73
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,000
All right, see you
next shift, sir.

74
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,250
[gasps]

75
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,458
I see.

76
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,708
Thanks, Yabu.
It helps immensely.

77
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,708
[YABU gasps]
You're welcome, Lieutenant.

78
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,500
[DESLER'S COURTESANS]
One moment, please.

79
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,291
Our Supreme Lord is
using the hotline

80
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,750
and is not to be interrupted.

81
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,833
The hotline...?

82
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,041
Get out of the way!

83
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,125
--But ma'am--
--[CELESTRA] I said move!

84
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,125
[DESLER laughs]
Well forgive me

85
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,375
if I've jumped to
erroneous conclusions.

86
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,875
But you can understand why
I'd suspect such a thing.

87
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,875
I thought you had gone
back to your old tricks

88
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,666
out of pity for them.

89
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,375
You're my empire's
heart and soul.

90
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,000
So, I worry about anything
coming between us.

91
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,208
Peace across the galaxies
will only be possible

92
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,375
through our
enduring friendship.

93
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,541
Agreed?

94
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,916
I think a conversation in
person is long overdue.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,875
Let's make it happen, shall we?

96
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,458
And what brings you
two to my chambers?

97
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,666
Preparations for
Senior General Domel's

98
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,625
medal ceremony
are complete.

99
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,083
Glad to hear it.

100
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,625
And what about you, Gimleh?

101
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,083
I've come to report the Imperial
Guard's latest findings

102
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,375
about rogue elements
within the Empire, sir.

103
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,708
My secret police have
much to address.

104
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,875
I'm going to let you
make those calls.

105
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,333
You're free to handle
things however you wish.

106
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,041
Thank you, my lord, I
will not let you down.

107
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,500
[DESLER]
More importantly...

108
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,708
[CELESTRA] That's the Teron
vessel, isn't it, my lord?

109
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:26,166
The obvious question has always
been: where are they heading?

110
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,791
Where do they hope
their journey will end?

111
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,416
It now appears I've
found the answer.

Perhaps you've been
wondering why

121
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,333
I've recalled you from
the front lines, General.

122
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,666
I imagine it was
hard to swallow.

123
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,541
The border of the
Small Magellanic Cloud

124

is the lynchpin of our defenses.

The absence of the commanding
officer aids the enemy, sir.

Perhaps, but sadly
we've encountered

another problem in the

[DOMEL]
Yes, I've heard the rumors.

129

lost Shultz to them.

against the other barbarians,

I'm happy for you, Space Wolf,

but what concerns me is your
popularity among the people.

Imperial Command's full
of ambitious climbers,

144

and many of them resent your
meteoric rise to the top.

145
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,958
I know for a fact that your
new direct superior Goer

146
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,250
is one of "Sideburns"
Zoellik's lackeys.

Thank you, Admiral, but I have
no interest in politics.

Oh, I forgot to tell you, I'm
glad to hear your Melda's safe.

Ha! My daughter has
been impossible!

detail about the ordeal

It's torture!

Are you paying attention
to this, Elk?

Even the fearsome Admiral Ditz
has a chink in his armor.

Shut up, Talan.

00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,000
I guess you're right.

319
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,250
[TOKUGAWA] You've still
got a mom and brother

320
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,458
back home, don't you?

321
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,333
[TOKUGAWA]
I'm lucky.

322
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:11,208
My eldest has a wife and child,
and I've got a second son, too.

323
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,541
Oh yeah?

324
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,500
[TOKUGAWA] The younger
one says he actually wants

325
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,791
to follow in his old man's
footsteps one day.

326
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,291
As a sailor?

327
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,166
A rather fanciful dream now
that we've lost our fleet.

328
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,791
But still, it must be
nice to hear, right?

329
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,666
Eh. No, I don't need
to pass the torch.

330
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,750
[SHIMA]
Uh?

331
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,458
I'm more concerned
about my grandkid.

332
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,791
She deserves to be happy
and I can't die

333
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,625
until I find her a good match!

334
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,166
It's not gonna be
easy finding someone

335
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,041
who meets your high
standards, Chief!

336
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,458
Oh, I know, maybe you'll
want to marry her!

337
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,500
Aiko's going to be a
magnificent woman,

338
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,583
you'd be a perfect couple!

339
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,875
No! I'm not really looking to--

340
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,083
[gasps]

341
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,541
I'll get back to you
in twenty years.

342
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,083
[BOTH laugh]

343
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,333
Listen, Shima.

344
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,333
[SHIMA]
Huh?

345
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,583
We don't always
come to the table

346
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,250
with the same set of facts.

347
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,375
You act on what
you think is true.

348
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,291
And the other side may see it
a completely different way.

349
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,750
But in the end,
there's only one reality.

350
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:12,333
War did start, and now we all
have to suffer through it.

351
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,166
Yet despite all the
painful losses,

352
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,875
you and I still
have family left.

353
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:20,000
That makes us pretty damn lucky,
don't you think?

354
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:25,958
[knocking]

355
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,916
[KODAI]
It's Lieutenant Kodai.

356
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,083
[KODAI]
Excuse me, sir.

357
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,541
This room's last on my list.

358
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,791
Uh!

359
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,333
[OKITA] Your timing's excellent.

360
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,416
I was just thinking that I would
like to talk to you, Lieutenant.

361
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,666
[KODAI gasps]

362
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,541
[YAMAMOTO grunting]

363
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,416
[SHIMA]
So, you finished your sentence.

364
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,041
Six days staring at a wall.

365
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,875
Since when are you
on cleaning detail?

366
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,166
[SHIMA]
Huh? Oh.

367
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,750
Some get the brig
and some get the mop.

368
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,416
[OKITA] That day,
I disobeyed orders, too.

369
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
[gasps]

370
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,125
[OKITA]
I opposed the preemptive attack,

371
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,666
and was removed from command.

372
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,958
So that's what really happened?

373
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,625
Do you think what
I did was right?

374
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,875
Of course I do!

375
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,083
I second-guessed my superior.

376
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,958
A good soldier is never supposed
to disobey an order.

377
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,250
No matter what.

378
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,833
[KODAI]
Yeah, but Captain--

379
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,583
And yet, there are extreme
times when a soldier must

380
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:25,875
remember a higher duty and be
a good human being instead.

381
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,750
People make mistakes
regardless of rank.

382
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,791
You need the courage to disobey
an order you believe is wrong,

383
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,916
especially when
lives are at stake.

384
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,208
In war, it's the only way
you can live with yourself

385
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,916
once the bloodshed is over.

386
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,250
I understand how you felt.

387
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,833
You wanted to shoot her down
to avenge your family.

388
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,708
And yet my sworn enemy
ended up saving my life.

389
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,000
For all we know that was a
trick, the point is you were

390
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,208
staying true to yourself
and our side!

391
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,166
Maybe Kodai's being too
naive about Melda Ditz,

392
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,875
thinking we can
understand each other.

393
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,125
That said,

394
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,916
I do understand a little now.

395
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,125
[gasps]

396
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,291
[DAIGO]
Don't worry.

397
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,916
Your old man isn't
going there to fight.

398
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,875
I'm sure we can forge a
friendship with this alien race.

399
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,541
But she's the enemy.

400
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,000
Don't you hate her?

401
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,875
I did at first,
but not anymore.

402
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,625
[SHIMA]
You think so?

403
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,625
I do.

404
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,083
Never lose hope, son.

405
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,208
[YAMAMOTO] I had plenty of
time to cool my head.

406
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,416
[SHIMA] I see.

407
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,458
[ding]

408
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,708
Kodai's been worried about you.

409
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,875
I'm heading up there soon.

410
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,458
[SHIMA]
Akira.

411
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,541
Thank you for the chat.

412
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,958
[SHIMA grunts]
I'll cool my head, too.

413
00:21:56,708 --> 00:22:00,333
So, that Milky Way Lunch in
the galley, still goin' on?

414
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,083
It ends next week.

415
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,791
At least, I think.

416
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,708
Are you free tomorrow?

417
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,208
You bet.

418
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,375
[gasps]

419
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,250
Report!

420
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,458
[OTA]
Hit to port side!

421
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,333
Looks like a torpedo!

422
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,000
[OKITA]
The <i>Yamato</i> hides,

423
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:10,375
like wounded prey, while an
invisible hunter searches

424
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,791
with eyes that penetrate
normal space,

425
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:16,625
sharpening its fangs
for a lethal strike.

426
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:19,166
Is there any escape from
that dreaded bite?

427
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,000
Listen across the cold expanse,

428
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:24,250
and you might just
hear the howl.

429
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:27,291
Next time: The Wolf
from Another Dimension.

430
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,541
There are three 317 days left

431
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:32,041
before the extinction
of the human race.
