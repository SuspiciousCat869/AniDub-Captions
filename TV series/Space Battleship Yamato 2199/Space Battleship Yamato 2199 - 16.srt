When you put it like that, then
we don't really have a choice.

3
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:06,449
But are you sure you
want to trust me?

00:02:08,702 --> 00:02:09,577
[ITO]
All right.

We're ready to move any time.

00:02:21,506 --> 00:02:24,217
[ENOMOTO] Jeez, they really
did a number on us.

7
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:28,596

8
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:32,434
[DR. SADO] It's not the surgery,
he's recovering from that fine.

9
00:02:32,517 --> 00:02:33,977
It's the overwork.

10
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,895
He needs more rest, that's all.

11
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:38,023
So make sure he gets it.

12
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:39,190
Right.

13
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:42,569
[NANBU]
I'm worried about the captain.

14
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:45,822
He'll be okay. The guy's
immortal, remember?

15
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:47,073
So they say.

16
00:02:47,157 --> 00:02:49,325
Our real problem is
finding more water.

17
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:51,036
That'll work out, too.

18
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,370
[NANBU]
You sound optimistic...

19
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:53,872
That's it?

20
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:54,748
[SHIMA]
Yeah.

21
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:56,207
[OTA]
Beemela-Four.

22
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,460
It's fourth in the system
and right in the sweet spot.

23
00:02:58,543 --> 00:03:01,296
It looks like there's plenty of
water down there, doesn't it?

24
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:02,839
And judging from
our initial readings,

25
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:04,382
there's ample oxygen, too.

26
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:06,760
As long as there's nothing with
claws and fangs down there,

27
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:08,678
then resupplying should
be a piece of cake!

28
00:03:08,762 --> 00:03:10,388
Who knows, maybe
it'll be so nice

29
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:12,640
we'll wanna stay
there for good!

30
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:14,059
Maybe so.

31
00:03:24,277 --> 00:03:27,572
Shima, I need you to prepare the
ship to land on Beemela-Four.

Aye-aye, sir.

00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:32,786
I want you to take
the lead on this.

00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:33,953

This is wonderful.

Hey, Misaki. Are you
okay back there?

It's just...

Lately I've had these gaps in my
memory, and it's kinda weird.

Gaps, huh? That doesn't
sound fine to me.

Lieutenant.

60
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:26,358
You're a good officer
and a talented analyst.

61
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:29,944
I hope you know that I
value your contributions.

00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:31,071
Thank you.

63
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:32,864
Tell me. Are you involved
in some plan

64
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:35,617
to resettle the human
race on Beemela-Four?

65
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,535
It's going to be exceedingly
difficult for us

66
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:40,413
to complete our current
objective, sir. In fact,

67
00:05:40,497 --> 00:05:42,540
I would even call it impossible.

68
00:05:42,624 --> 00:05:44,250
Assuming we can
evade the Gamilans,

69
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:46,419
there's still not enough time
at our current warp pace

70
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:48,463
to make it to
Iscandar and back.

71
00:05:48,546 --> 00:05:49,839
What's more.

72
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:52,008
We aren't even certain where
Iscandar is, exactly.

73
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:55,136
We're simply trusting our
auto-nav can get us there.

74
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,305
Isn't that right sir?

75
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:59,808
Meanwhile, we do know
Beemela-Four is within our reach

76
00:05:59,891 --> 00:06:02,602
and it could most likely serve
as a new home for all of us.

77
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:03,895
That will be all.

78
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:05,313
We should return to Earth
and prepare to move

If the United Nations had the
same information we do now,

82

they'd make the same choice!

00:06:11,611 --> 00:06:14,989
Take my side, sir!
Please, I'm begging you!

84
00:06:15,782 --> 00:06:18,368
I'm sorry. But I can't do that.

00:10:24,572 --> 00:10:26,866
Beemela-Four can sustain
human life and would be

161
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,953
an ideal candidate for a
full-scale colonization.

162
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:33,289
Despite our best efforts, the
<i>Yamato</i> is far behind schedule.

163
00:10:33,373 --> 00:10:36,960
So, after deliberating with our
XO, I've reached a decision.

164
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:38,461
As you all know,

165
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:40,672
from the start, the Yamato Plan
only offered a slim chance

166
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:42,841
of success but it was
our best choice.

167
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:44,884
Mankind was desperate.

168
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:46,886
But this planet
changes everything.

169
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,264
We will now return to Earth
and share our information

170
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:51,141
about Beemela-Four
with command.

171
00:10:51,224 --> 00:10:52,809
What in the hell?!

172
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:54,310
Once we've resupplied,

173
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:56,438
we will begin our
journey back home.

174
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:58,356
This choice has
the full approval

175
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,400
of Captain Okita, as well.

176
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,070
[SHIMA] Security has been
deployed for your safety,

177
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:06,072
in case of any confusion
about this temporary

178
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:08,450
transfer of command.
That is all.

179
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:11,578
What in the world's
happening up there, Chief?

180
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:12,912
I don't know.

181
00:11:12,996 --> 00:11:15,081
Let's talk to Shima and
get to the bottom of this.

182
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:16,374
Right.

I'm sorry Chief.

You're surprisingly good
at this, acting captain.

Do you have any idea
what you're doing,

00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:01,062
and what the implications are?

Don't delude yourselves,

Shut up.

Once we're on Earth, I'll tell
everyone exactly what happened!

00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:10,572
I told you to shut up!

This sneaky imposter
isn't from Earth.

220

You think Mori's an alien?
Are you completely insane?

221
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,047
Remember what Okita said?

222
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,050
A year before our journey began,
an Iscandarian arrived on Earth

223
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:33,261
with detailed plans for
the Wave Motion Engine.

224
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,430
So? Where'd she go after that?

225
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:37,807
All he would say about
her was her name.

226
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:41,186
Yurisha Iscandar.

227
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:42,604
Tell me.

228
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:45,648
What do you guys suppose
happened to this helpful alien?

229
00:13:45,732 --> 00:13:48,943
There are rumors.
They say she died in a blast.

230
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:51,863
Yeah well the rumors
aren't true. She's alive.

231
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:53,948
And she's sitting
right on our bridge.

232
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:55,950
She has been the whole time.

233
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:59,704
That's quite a theory, Ito.
But it isn't true.

234
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:02,415
[ITO]
Heh.

235
00:14:02,957 --> 00:14:05,210
[gasps] Wait, that's...

236
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:08,296
Yes. I found this
in your quarters.

237
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,176
Extraordinary. Considering that
it's not human technology.

238
00:14:14,302 --> 00:14:16,513
[HIRATA] You think it's
native to this world?

239
00:14:16,596 --> 00:14:18,264
[KODAI] It looks a lot
like the Iscandarian ship

240
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:19,599
I saw crash on Mars.

241
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:20,892
Of course it does.

242
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:23,853
It's from Iscandar,
there's no doubt about it.

[ANALYZER] No signs of
life detected on vessel.

244

Initial scans suggest
that it has been here

245
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,569
for approximately 400 years.

246
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:33,488
Maybe that's why
the bug ran off.

247
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:35,782
It was afraid of this ship.

248
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:38,535
It's true. A long time ago,

249
00:14:38,618 --> 00:14:41,413
Iscandarians did
come to this world.

250

[HIRATA]
Huh?

251
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:46,543
Their only purpose
was salvation.

[STARSHA] The ultimate salvation
of all intelligent life-forms

the true meaning of

254
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:55,844
the "path to Iscandar."
And it is the duty of our family

255

to be the guides on that path.

It is now your turn
to fulfill that task.

Bring hope to the
people of Earth.

00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:10,525
Give them the courage to
make that hope a reality.

00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:12,736

00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:59,282

what I'm here for.

[HIRATA] That's right.
We can't reach the <i>Yamato</i> .

Well done.

Is there a way to contact
the landing party from here?

Doubt it. From what I can tell,

00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:45,407
they've got the comms

of mutineers who wanted

00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:02,859
we have to let them on board.

Are you suggesting
we leave them here?

We talked about this, Shima.

Yes, sir. He had reason
to believe backers

412
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,471
of the Izumo Plan had
infiltrated the <i>Yamato</i> crew

413
00:21:54,554 --> 00:21:56,765
and ordered me to
investigate under cover.

without letting

But thanks to assistance
from Lieutenant Shima,

we were able to control it
and prevent bloodshed.

No. I'm responsible for
this as much as anyone.

420
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:13,573
The only reason they did this
is because we were behind

421

schedule, and it's my job
to keep us on track.

Well there's good news.

be a problem anymore.

If the data Kodai's landing team

426
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:24,084
found on Beemela-Four
is accurate,

427
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:27,629
we can more than make up
for all the lost time.

428
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:29,005
Seriously?

429
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:31,216
Yeah. The irony is if
we hadn't stopped

430
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:33,426
on Beemela-Four we
never would've known.

431
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,178
[OKITA]
Strange indeed.

432
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:37,764
I suppose it's possible
all this was a trial.

433

Laid out for us along the
path by the Iscandarians.
