[speaking Gamilan]


6
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,500
[DESLER]
You wrote a good speech.

7
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,916
[CELESTRA]
You honor me, my lord.

8
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:36,833
[DESLER] My people are such
foolish, submissive creatures.

9
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,666
And they bore me to death.

10
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,958
That's their gravest flaw.

11
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,375
Well, your post-speech
entertainment

12
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,250
should be a cure for that.

13
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,000
[DESLER]
You mean that ship?

14
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,791
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:49,708
[DESLER]
Hmph.

00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:59,625
[applause]

17
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,458
Your lordship,

18
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,208
on behalf of everyone here,
I congratulate you.

19
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,000
Today marks 1,000 years
of Gamilan history

20
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,375
and the 103 year of your reign.

21
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,791
Why thank you, Viceroy Hyss.

22
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,708
The Great Gamilas Empire
has successfully united

23
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,333
the Large and Small
Magellanic Cloud galaxies,

24
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,458
and now reaches
into the Milky Way,

25
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,375
expanding your territory
with each new day.

26
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:30,583
Your glory shines bright, like
a beacon across the Universe.

27
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,583
Your unification policy
is working as well, sir.

28
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,833
Thanks to your wisdom,

29
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,708
those who submit have
been allowed to join us

30
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,291
instead of facing eradication.

31
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:43,583
And now they contribute to the
cause as second-class citizens.

32
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,500
[ZOELLIK]
Glory to our supreme lord!

33
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:50,208
His deeds are more fit for a
righteous god than a mortal!

34
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,708
I praise him!

35
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:55,583
No enemy in the cosmos can
withstand our military power!

36
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,291
Gamilas is invincible!

37
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,458
We will never be defeated!

38
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,500
[DITZ]
Arrogance is a mistake!

39
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,416
We must always remain vigilant.

40
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,916
We still have invaders
in the Small Cloud.

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,916
Boasts won't stop them.

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,291
Admiral!

43
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,458
Am I mistaken, or did
you just call me a braggart?

44
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,083
As leader of the fleets,
I merely speak the truth.

45
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,875
Take it however you want.

46
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,208
Your lordship.
We have come up with a plan

47
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,875
to eliminate the
barbarian invaders.

48
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,333
Senior General Domel
is headed there now.

49
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:32,083
Oh really, you've
sent the Space Wolf?

50
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:36,166
That's good; he can show
the rest of you how it's done.

51
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,833
Now, let's move on to the fun.

52
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:41,125
I've prepared some entertainment
to help with morale.

53
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:44,041
I know your jobs
can be so stressful.

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,250
Tonight, comrades,

55
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,333
you'll be watching video
from the front lines

56
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,833
of our war in the
galactic hinterlands.

57
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,000
And what are we
going to see there?

58
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,125
[CELESTRA]
Our lord has devised a trap.

59
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:03,666
And you will have the privilege
of watching as it's sprung.

60
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,625
All right, shall we?

61
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,916
Let the little game begin.

62
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,041
[MISAKI] Like the old
refrain tells us, listeners,

63
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:18,541
when you wish upon a star,
you really can ask for anything.

64
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,125
All that matters is
how much you want it.

65
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,708
If your heart is
truly committed,

66
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:26,000
then the heavens will look
down on you, and be kind.

67
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,833
No matter how impossible it
seems, fate can show us a way.

68
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,541
[sighs]

69
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,000
And that's it for Radio Yamato!

70
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,666
Our next broadcast
will be at ship time 2030.

71
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,541
so make sure you tune in!

72
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,583
Signing off.

73
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,250
This has been Yuria Misaki!

74
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,416
[ENGINEER]
And that's a wrap!

75
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,958
[MISAKI] You sure it's cool
for you to be killing time

76
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,291
with me like this?

77
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah.

78
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,458
I'm off duty right now.

79
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,375
[MISAKI]
Mm-hmm

80
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,083
[HOSHINA]
Hey, you hear the rumor?

81
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,750
Huh?

82
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,333
There's a door up
here that never opens.

83
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,625
And supposedly the ghost
of a beautiful woman lives

84
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,083
on the other side of it.

85
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,583
Pretty spooky, right?

86
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,791
Big deal.
I've seen plenty of ghosts.

87
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,125
Huh?

88
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,125
Back on Earth, they
appeared to me all the time.

89
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:23,875
Ah! Ah! Um... Seriously?

90
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,000
[OTA]
Current position.

91
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,250
Eight light years from Earth
in the Sirius star system.

92
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,208
Cruising at 18 space-knots.

93
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,000
We'll be attempting 12 more
light years with our next warp.

94
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,416
That would get us
to Gliese 581, Captain.

95
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Twelve more light years huh?

96
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,625
That would make this
our last chance to see Earth

97
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,583
through the <i>Yamato</i> 's
deep-space telescope

98
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,000
before we're out of range.

99
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,125
Put her up.

100
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,583
[SANADA]
Yes, sir.

101
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:54,916
[KODAI]
Whoa.

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,208
[NANBU]
That's Earth?

103
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,458
That's right.

104
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,541
We're now eight-point-six
light years away.

105
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,875
So actually,

106
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,708
that's how the Earth
looked over eight years ago.

107
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:07,416
Before she was massacred
when the Gamilans attacked.

108
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,333
[OKITA]
Take a long look, everyone.

109
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,333
This is what we're fighting for.

110
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,208
The Earth that used to be.

111
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,041
The Earth we can reclaim.

112
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:16,833
Shima.

113
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,791
Prepare the ship for warp.

114
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:19,791
[SHIMA]
Aye-aye, Captain.

115
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,333
Preparing now.

116
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,083
[OPERATOR B]
The <i>Yamato</i> has jumped.

117
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,958
Identify the jump coordinates!

118
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,208
[OPERATOR B] Calculating
space-time wave motion.

119

[OPERATOR C]
Tracing space wake.

120
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,208
[OPERATOR A]
Deputy Commander!

121
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,416
One of our own resupply ships
is requesting a rendezvous.

122
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,791
Daddy, hi!

123
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,916
Finish your assignment soon.
I can't wait to see you!

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,625
Mom's worried, as usual,
but you know Mom.

125
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:50,958
I'm sure you're just fine.

126
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,375
My choices are clear.

127
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:56,291
Our only options
are victory or death.

128
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,333
Sorry, Hilde. This is it.

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,583
[GANZ] Commander! General Goer
has sent a resupply!

130
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,833
[SHULTZ]
Huh... Huh?!

131
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,000
A resupply?

132
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,166
You're sure?

133
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,750
[GANZ]
Yes, Commander!

134
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,875
We're not abandoned after all!

135
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,166
Lord Desler!

136
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,333
As your chosen commander
of this galactic theater.

137
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,666
It is my highest honor

138
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,291
to be supervising this
grand operation that you,

139
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,250
in your infinite brilliance
and glory, have designed!

140
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,625
That's quite enough.

141
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,958
Just tell me.

142
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,583
Did you get the special
package I sent you, Goer?

143
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,500
Yes! I was just getting to that!

144
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,208
You mean the new torpedo, sir?

145
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,666
The Desler Torpedo.

146
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,166
Yes, the Desler Torpedo!

147
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,875
We've already deployed it
to the front, just as you asked!

148
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,416
[MORI]
Warp complete.

149
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,583
We are now in the
Gliese 581 system, sir.

150
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:51,458
Perfect.

151
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,125
We're now 20.4 light years out.

152
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:58,458
And there's Gliese 581,
an M-class red dwarf.

153
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,208
[DR. SADO]
Hm...

154
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,250
Looks like that warp didn't
have any negative effects.

155
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,500
But don't get complacent,

156
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,500
this doesn't mean
you're in the clear.

157
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,833
[NIIMI]
This is Lieutenant Niimi.

158
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,125
I'm coming in.

159
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,833
[DR. SADO]
Well, take care.

160
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,875
On to the next patient, Doctor.

161
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,666
Is this a good time?

162
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,500

this system has a planet

I'd like to deploy a ground team

It appears that we've run into

324
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,083
[DR. SADO]
This is bad!

325
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,083
[HARADA]
Doctor, you need to wear this!

326
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,375
[DR. SADO]
Where's the captain?

327
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,250
Huh?!

328
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,041
Who the heck flies into a star?

329
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,666
Turn us around, morons!

330
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,208
Or are you trying to
get the captain killed?

331
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,583
[OKITA]
It's okay.

332
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,583
My old battle wounds
are just flaring up.

333
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,958
I'm just fine.

334
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:54,958
Right, doc?

335
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,166
[DR. SADO]
Uhh...

336
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah!

337
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,791
I'm sure that's what it is!

338
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,750
I'll just take a quick look,
due diligence and all.

339
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,750
Let's check that pulse.

340
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,458
Yup, like I thought,
no problem here!

341
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,041
Just a little fatigue.

342
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,625
Guess I'll give you a nutrient
injection and call it a day!

343
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,916
Close call.

344
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,458
I've been instructed
to keep you alive

345
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,666
and you're making
that very difficult.

346
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,708
You need to listen to me
and manage your condition!

347
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:25,791
If you keep this up, you'll--!

348
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,500
I know the stakes. Trust me.

349
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,750
[OTA] Solar prominence
straight ahead, SK-223.

350
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,125
Steer to port!

351
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,208
Captain.

352
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,416
That gas is having
some kind of reaction!

353
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,958
[SANADA] It's trying
to absorb the star,

354
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,125
but the star's absorbing it.

355
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,625
I see.

356
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,416
So this is why you brought
us here, isn't it, Captain?

357
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,875
Incompetent fools!

358
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,666
You just floated
there and watched

359
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,750
while Lord Desler's magnificent
weapon was devoured!

360
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,125
You're a useless, inferior race!

361
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,291
This is on your head,
you understand me?

362
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,875
Yours and yours alone!

363
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,625
I won't be dragged down by this!

364
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,125
I'll make sure Lord De--

365
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,125
Prepare for battle!

366
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,666
We'll give the <i>Yamato</i>
everything we've got left!

367
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,583
We follow Commander Shultz!

368
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,208
[CREW]
We follow Commander Shultz!

369
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,625
There's trouble ahead!

370
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,541
A massive solar flare!

371
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,708
[KODAI]
Shima, can we get around it?

372
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:49,458
Negative!

373
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,458
It's too big!

374
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:51,583
There's no way!

375
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,583
Full speed, ahead!

376
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,458
Kodai.

377
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,416
We'll use the Wave Motion Gun.

378
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,125
Yes, sir.

379
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,666
Wait, you mean
on the solar flare?

380
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,875
[OKITA]
That's an order!

381
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,791
Yes, sir!

382
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,041
Prepare to fire at solar flare!

383
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,291
Circuit to Wave Motion Gun open.

384
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,291
Vents sealed.

385
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,416
Force injector: Activating.

386
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Safety lock released.

387
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,708
Confirming: Force
injector active.

388
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,541
Tachyon particle pressure
is rising in chamber.

389
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,416
Eighty.

390
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,375
Eighty-five.

391
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,750
Ninety percent.

392
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,833
Enemy ship! Approaching quickly!

393
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,833
[OTA]
Hit to starboard side!

394
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,166
[OKITA]
Ignore them!

395
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,958
[MORI] Ten seconds
before we're too close!

396
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,916
Energy charge complete,
120 percent!

397
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,875
Wave Motion Gun. Fire!

398
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,666
Now straight through
that opening!

399
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,458
Full speed ahead!

400
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,541
[OPERATOR B] Sir!
The <i>Yamato</i> 's broken through!

401
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,541
[OPERATOR A] Ship
temperature: three million bek!

402
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,791
Impossible.

403
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,333
[OPERATOR A]
Our ship can't handle this heat!

404
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,333
Stern is melting!

405
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,541
[OPERATOR B]
We've lost control!

406
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,458
[GANZ]
Glory to Zaltz!

407
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,000
[CREW]
Glory to Zaltz!

408
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,625
[GAMILAN OPERATOR]
Video signal lost.

409
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,916
My Lord Supreme.

410
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,625
Clearly that inferior
Shultz has failed you!

411
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:48,125
And failed me as well.

412
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,833
A splendid battle.

413
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,791
Packed with drama
until the very last shot.

414
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,041
You're welcome, men.

415
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,125
I trust you were all
as entertained as I.

416
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,333
Now, Hyss.

417
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,666
Yes, Sir!

418
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,958
[DESLER] Award all our
dead a two-rank promotion.

419
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,291
Furthermore, give their
families honorary status

420
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,000
as first-class Gamilans.

421
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,791
Zar Beluk!

422
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:11,875
All right.

423
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,166
That concludes
tonight's festivities.

424
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,250
Good night, comrades.

425
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,583
[ALL]
Garle Desler!

426
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,166
[DESLER]
Oh, one more thing, Celestra.

427
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,666
What's the name of that Teron
ship that performed so well?

428
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,708
They call it the
<i>Yamato</i> , your lordship.

429
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,791
[DESLER]
Hmph...

430
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,500
The <i>Yamato</i> ?

431
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,125
I'll have to remember that.

432
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,166
[VELTE]
Hmm...

433
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,541
Is something wrong?

434
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,291
That massive weapon that
broke through the flare.

435
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,583
It appeared to be similar

436
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,291
to one of our prototypes
in Weapons Development.

437
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,416
Are you sure, Velte?

438
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,958
That can't be.

439
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,083
[MISAKI] I don't know
about you, listeners,

440
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,416
but I'll sure be making
another wish tonight.

441
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,208
Remember: All that matters
is what's in your heart.

442
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,625
If you are truly committed,

443
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,208
then the heavens will look
down on you, and be kind.

444
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,291
No matter how
impossible it seems,

445
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,916
fate can show us a way.

446
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,875
[MISAKI] This is your host,
Yuria Misaki, signing off.

447
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,833
[OKITA] Gamilloids,
the artificial soldiers

448
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,625
and vanguard of the enemy.

449
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:25,416
We've captured one
still capable of speech,

450
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,291
but how can we know
if his words are truth, or lies?

451
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,500
Can a conversation
between automatons give us

452
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,458
that answer, or only
lead to more questions?

453
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:37,041
Where is the line
between life and machine?

454
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:39,666
Next time: "Clockwork Prisoner."

455
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,083
There are 339 days left

456
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:44,791
before the extinction
of the human race.
