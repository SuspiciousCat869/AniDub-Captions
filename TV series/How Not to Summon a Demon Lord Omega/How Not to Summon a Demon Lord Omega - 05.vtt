00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:16.934 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Diablo! Diablo!

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:25.734 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] No. No!
Please, please be okay.

00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:28.695 position:50% align:center
What just happened?

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.036 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Never thought my
Underwater Movement skill

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.038 position:50% align:center
would end up coming in so handy.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.291 position:50% align:center
Though I still can't move
as freely as I expected.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:43.418 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Horn!

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.973 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Well, it was
fun while it lasted.

00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:21.767 position:50% align:center
RIP EX rank equipment.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.519 position:50% align:center
Thanks for burning like a boss.

00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:25.437 position:50% align:center
That was such a close call.

00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:27.439 position:50% align:center
Sucks that I had to
lose my Tenma's Staff

00:02:27.523 --> 00:02:29.566 position:50% align:center
in all that chaos, too.

00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:32.486 position:50% align:center
[HORN groans]

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.905 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I don't know what
ailments are possible out here,

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.366 position:50% align:center
but sleeping in wet
clothes can't be good.

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.159 position:50% align:center
This fire will
probably die soon.

00:02:39.243 --> 00:02:41.745 position:50% align:center
I should get him out of those
so he doesn't freeze.

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:48.627 position:50% align:center
There we go.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.338 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I never realized
how scrawny he is.

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.340 position:50% align:center
You need to pump up
those pecs, bro.

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:56.218 position:50% align:center
His pants are wet, too.

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.512 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Whatever.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:02:59.847 position:50% align:center
Just a couple guys

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.224 position:50% align:center
helping each other out
in a damp cave.

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:04.309 position:50% align:center
Man these things are soaked!

00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:06.186 position:50% align:center
Kitty litter.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.108 position:50% align:center
What the? That's not right.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.109 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Where's his...?

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.777 position:50% align:center
Is that a hmm-hmm?

00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:15.445 position:50% align:center
The clothes looked
like a dude's, so...

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.030 position:50% align:center
No, no, no, no, no!

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Where are we?

00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:24.538 position:50% align:center
Um, what happened?

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:26.665 position:50% align:center
Where are your clothes?

00:03:36.884 --> 00:03:38.468 position:50% align:center
I swear, I have no idea
why I'm naked!

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:40.888 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] This is not
what I signed up to do!

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:43.765 position:50% align:center
Please give me my clothes.
They're way too small for you!

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center
Oh good, you're awake now.
It's about time.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.477 position:50% align:center
I just saved your life because

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.521 position:50% align:center
you're weak and
I'm a Demon Lord.

00:03:49.605 --> 00:03:51.064 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:53.984 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] I've uh, learned a
thing or two about mortal races.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.485 position:50% align:center
You can die if your
clothes are wet.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.738 position:50% align:center
So I bravely removed
them for you!

00:03:57.821 --> 00:03:59.656 position:50% align:center
You're welcome, I guess!

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.453 position:50% align:center
[HORN sighs]
I was just surprised.

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:05.871 position:50% align:center
Trust me, so was I!

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:10.834 position:50% align:center
Thank you. It was kind of you
to save my li--[sneezes]

00:04:10.918 --> 00:04:14.505 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] If you're cold,
just move in closer if you want.

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:15.839 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Hm?

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.304 position:50% align:center
I can't stop
worrying about him.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
It's hard being an
obsessive elf sometimes,

00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:27.267 position:50% align:center
but you know Diablo will
be back with Horn soon.

00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:31.188 position:50% align:center
We have to keep moving forward.
He'd want it that way.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
Have faith. That's what'll
pull us through.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.985 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
You're so right.

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:40.280 position:50% align:center
Duh! 'Cause he's Diablo!

00:04:40.364 --> 00:04:41.865 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
I should've been more specific

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.326 position:50% align:center
about moving in
closer to the fire.

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.287 position:50% align:center
I didn't think
she was that dense.

00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:48.872 position:50% align:center
Ahem!

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
Would you care to explain to me
why you were dressed like a man?

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:53.669 position:50% align:center
Oh sure.

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:57.089 position:50% align:center
When I was young, I was
separated from my parents.

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:59.258 position:50% align:center
Or maybe they abandoned me.

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:02.970 position:50% align:center
And when you're feeling alone,
It feels so much safer.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:04.179 position:50% align:center
And convenient.

00:05:04.263 --> 00:05:05.764 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
That had to have been hard.

00:05:05.848 --> 00:05:07.516 position:50% align:center
Surviving on her own.

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.309 position:50% align:center
She's so brave.

00:05:09.393 --> 00:05:11.854 position:50% align:center
When I was much younger,
on cold days,

00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:15.274 position:50% align:center
my family and I used to
huddle up like this.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.317 position:50% align:center
To keep each other warm?

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:25.993 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Papa.

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:29.913 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Nope! We're not going there!

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:31.707 position:50% align:center
[HORN] What I meant
by that was, you know,

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.668 position:50% align:center
like a, a sign of respect!

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.128 position:50% align:center
Like I respect you
as an adventurer

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:38.172 position:50% align:center
that I want to be like someday!

00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:42.342 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Mm-kay. Anyway,
what area are we in now?

00:05:42.426 --> 00:05:43.886 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Hey, Mister.

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:46.638 position:50% align:center
Do you think all of
our friends are okay?

00:05:46.722 --> 00:05:49.516 position:50% align:center
Because of the monsters
on that last floor?

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:53.520 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
I'm sure they're fine.

00:05:53.604 --> 00:05:56.106 position:50% align:center
Shera's gotten pretty
good with her bow.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.066 position:50% align:center
The tenth floor
moves and separates,

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
but Rem's sharp eye
will keep them safe.

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:02.487 position:50% align:center
The eleventh floor
has a graveyard

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:04.031 position:50% align:center
with corpses on the attack,

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:06.992 position:50% align:center
but Lumachina's prayers
are so powerful.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.995 position:50% align:center
Wow! It sounds like
they've got it handled!

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:13.165 position:50% align:center
However, if they make
it to the twelfth floor,

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:14.750 position:50% align:center
they'll meet the Guardian,

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:17.794 position:50% align:center
and the three of them
won't be enough.

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.421 position:50% align:center
Uh... Guardian?

00:06:19.505 --> 00:06:21.632 position:50% align:center
We need to find them soon.

00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:25.385 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Whoa! What are those?

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:26.595 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
A reason to celebrate!

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50% align:center
Now we have answers!

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:31.892 position:50% align:center
At least I know exactly
where we are now!

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.771 position:50% align:center
'Kay, this is the twelfth floor.

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:36.772 position:50% align:center
Great! Let's go!

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:37.940 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:41.235 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Rem, is someone out there?

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:42.736 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Yeah.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:46.240 position:50% align:center
And it may or may not be
a Level Eighty Death Dancer.

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.660 position:50% align:center
Look what the cat threw up!

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.203 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:54.039 position:50% align:center
I must've overshot when I was
rushing to catch up to you!

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.415 position:50% align:center
Silly me.

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:58.001 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] I don't understand.
How are you alive?

00:06:58.085 --> 00:06:59.795 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT]
Spoilers, dear.

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:01.922 position:50% align:center
I'm disappointed not to
see my favorite demon.

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
I wonder what happened to him?

00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT chuckles] What a perfect
opportunity for us.

00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:10.138 position:50% align:center
Lumachina, this is
for you, love. Die!

00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:15.394 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT]
Fire Bees! Come forth!

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:17.896 position:50% align:center
[SHERA gasps]

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.441 position:50% align:center
I don't think the bow's
gonna work. Plan B!

00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:27.739 position:50% align:center
[REM] Come forth.
Asulau, Rockpup, Dragonfly!

00:07:27.823 --> 00:07:31.076 position:50% align:center
[ALL roar]

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:33.161 position:50% align:center
Okay, now! Don't screw up!

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.250 position:50% align:center
Rose Prison, go!

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.338 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT]
So sorry!

00:07:43.422 --> 00:07:46.049 position:50% align:center
Your tactics are
simply too predictable!

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:49.678 position:50% align:center
What kind of jerk uses
his summons like that?

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:53.724 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT] Such desperate looks
on the faces of weak women.

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:56.518 position:50% align:center
They're just to die for!

00:07:56.602 --> 00:08:01.899 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT chuckles] Now, in which
way shall I kill you lovelies?

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:10.741 position:50% align:center
Hey! What's going on?

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:13.785 position:50% align:center
No! Not my precious summons!

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:19.708 position:50% align:center
This has gotta be
wind magic. Diab--

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.043 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:26.381 position:50% align:center
[KING BLACK DRAGON] What puny
beings dare to invade my land?

00:08:26.465 --> 00:08:30.093 position:50% align:center
You will all be granted
the same death.

00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:32.971 position:50% align:center
There's no way!
How'd that thing get in here?

00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:37.184 position:50% align:center
[KING BLACK DRAGON] Feeble foes,
if you wish to resist,

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:39.895 position:50% align:center
then unleash your power.

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:46.109 position:50% align:center
[REM] Wow. That's a
Large Black Dragon.

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:49.112 position:50% align:center
Look. I... I...
have better things to do

00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:50.948 position:50% align:center
than conquer a dungeon, ya know?

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.075 position:50% align:center
[KING BLACK DRAGON]
If you will not resist,

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:56.703 position:50% align:center
then I'll simply slaughter you
with a single blow.

00:08:57.621 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT]
Now wait just a minute.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:02.084 position:50% align:center
Don't go getting cocky on me.

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:03.794 position:50% align:center
Pathetic lizard!

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:15.430 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT]
Appear before me now. Ifrit!

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:20.561 position:50% align:center
[REM] He summoned the
ultimate fire summon!

00:09:20.644 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
Yep. So long, Lizard.

00:09:22.855 --> 00:09:25.482 position:50% align:center
It's the end of you! [chuckles]

00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:28.318 position:50% align:center
Get him, Ifrit! Attack!

00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:30.529 position:50% align:center
[IFRIT grunts]

00:09:36.368 --> 00:09:38.370 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT]
That's how it's done, Ifrit!

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:40.956 position:50% align:center
Show that sack of
scales who's boss!

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:48.422 position:50% align:center
My goodness, he's burning
through my MP like a monster.

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.340 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and finish him off!

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:07.441 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir! Lizard stew tonight!

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:10.235 position:50% align:center
[KING BLACK DRAGON] Are you
finished, miniature morsle?

00:10:10.319 --> 00:10:12.613 position:50% align:center
Have you had your
fill of despair?

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:13.947 position:50% align:center
I hope so.

00:10:14.031 --> 00:10:15.949 position:50% align:center
It's time to die!

00:10:16.033 --> 00:10:18.702 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:28.420 position:50% align:center

Ifrit, no! Don't die.

Please, come back!

00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:39.097 position:50% align:center
How could you destroy my prize?
My ultimate summon!

00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:40.933 position:50% align:center
[KING BLACK DRAGON]
How sad that this is the most

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
you mortal races can achieve.

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:56.865 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:58.492 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Um, we should go.

00:10:58.575 --> 00:10:59.660 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Good call.

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:00.911 position:50% align:center
Lumachina?

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.455 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:06.959 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] Please keep
holding on. I'll heal you now.

00:11:08.252 --> 00:11:10.671 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] Dear God,
please hear my prayers

00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:12.673 position:50% align:center
and save this man.

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:16.301 position:50% align:center
I beg you to grant him
your generous mercy.

00:11:16.385 --> 00:11:20.264 position:50% align:center
Huh. You must be out of
your mind. Or naive.

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:23.141 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
what all I've done?

00:11:23.225 --> 00:11:24.643 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
I care not.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:27.104 position:50% align:center
God grants forgiveness
without judgement,

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:31.108 position:50% align:center
and the opportunity to repent
for as long as we are alive.

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:36.154 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
So, God.

00:11:36.238 --> 00:11:39.032 position:50% align:center
Please heal the wounds
this man suffers from,

00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:41.869 position:50% align:center
and give him a second
chance at life.

00:11:41.952 --> 00:11:43.412 position:50% align:center
[KING BLACK DRAGON]
Really?

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:56.258 position:50% align:center
Very impressive.
God must be a wonderful person.

00:12:00.304 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me. We were
wondering if we might have

00:12:02.306 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
a word with you
before we run?

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:07.144 position:50% align:center
[KING BLACK DRAGON]
Hmm? I see a human blessed

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:11.440 position:50% align:center
with one wing by God,
an Elf with a Demon Lord's bow,

00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:13.567 position:50% align:center
and then you--the vessel of...

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.485 position:50% align:center
Well, isn't that special?

00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:16.737 position:50% align:center
[BOTH sigh]

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.363 position:50% align:center
[KING BLACK DRAGON]
It doesn't matter.

00:12:18.447 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
The lives of such diminutive
humans last but a moment.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.410 position:50% align:center
Even if they were to end now,

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:25.871 position:50% align:center
it would make
such little difference.

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:27.789 position:50% align:center
Wow, that's rude.

00:12:27.873 --> 00:12:31.210 position:50% align:center
[KING BLACK DRAGON]
Now, get out of my sight!

00:12:31.293 --> 00:12:33.629 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:12:39.343 --> 00:12:40.469 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:42.930 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Looks like
I made it just in time.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.228 position:50% align:center
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:12:50.187 --> 00:12:53.899 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO chuckles]
Unfortunately, I'm in a hurry.

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:55.150 position:50% align:center
I don't have time to sit through

00:12:55.234 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
one of your silly
shows right now.

00:12:57.653 --> 00:13:00.030 position:50% align:center
Let's go, you tragic Dragon!

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:03.992 position:50% align:center
[KING BLACK DRAGON]
Ah. So you wish to insult me.

00:13:04.076 --> 00:13:07.538 position:50% align:center
Then I'll grant you
the death you're begging for!

00:13:08.789 --> 00:13:14.086 position:50% align:center
Gather in light against those
who defy providence in the dark!

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:17.923 position:50% align:center
[KING BLACK DRAGON] I'll teach
you not to be so arrogant!

00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:19.758 position:50% align:center
Watch and learn!

00:13:20.634 --> 00:13:21.677 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Without Tenma's Staff,

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.429 position:50% align:center
this will take a bit
more time, but.

00:13:24.513 --> 00:13:26.974 position:50% align:center
It'll make it. It has to.

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:29.852 position:50% align:center
It's gonna make it in time! Yes!

00:13:29.935 --> 00:13:32.396 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Hercules Lance!

00:13:42.573 --> 00:13:44.825 position:50% align:center
[KING BLACK DRAGON]
Why, you...

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:46.952 position:50% align:center
Thunder Axe!

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:54.001 position:50% align:center
[KING BLACK DRAGON groans]

00:14:00.591 --> 00:14:06.013 position:50% align:center
[ALL cheering]

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.223 position:50% align:center
[KING BLACK DRAGON]
Impossible!

00:14:08.307 --> 00:14:12.394 position:50% align:center
I can't die at the hands
of a feeble minion!

00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:14.479 position:50% align:center
I won't die yet!

00:14:14.563 --> 00:14:16.148 position:50% align:center
I still have to
leave behind someone

00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:19.276 position:50% align:center
to inherit my... my memories.

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:21.445 position:50% align:center
So that's it.

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:26.700 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Of course. He's a
virgin, too. Makes sense.

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:29.786 position:50% align:center
Dragons probably have a harder
time meeting other Dragons.

00:14:32.206 --> 00:14:35.125 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] Pardon me. Who decided it
was okay for you to run off?

00:14:35.209 --> 00:14:36.502 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:14:36.585 --> 00:14:38.462 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] You are the guardian
of the twelfth floor.

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
Disobeying the Master's
orders warrants death.

00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:43.884 position:50% align:center
At least a thousand
of them here.

00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:47.095 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Wait a minute. Is that?

00:14:47.179 --> 00:14:50.307 position:50% align:center
Would you like me to
clean up that mess for you?

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
[KING BLACK DRAGON]
What? A mess?

00:14:52.184 --> 00:14:54.937 position:50% align:center
Get out of my way, you fool.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.356 position:50% align:center
You're nothing but
a mere puppet!

00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:05.322 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] Don't you ever, and I
mean ever, call me a puppet!

00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:08.575 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
It's time for you to pay for

00:15:08.659 --> 00:15:12.120 position:50% align:center
the price of your sins,
with your life!

00:15:12.204 --> 00:15:13.539 position:50% align:center
Krios!

00:15:19.503 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
[KING BLACK DRAGON groans]

00:15:23.841 --> 00:15:26.343 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] This was never
part of the arrangement.

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.929 position:50% align:center
I am not the guardian
of the twelfth floor.

00:15:29.012 --> 00:15:31.682 position:50% align:center
But I can clean it up for you.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.642 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
She's actually real.

00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
I remember her.

00:15:35.227 --> 00:15:37.271 position:50% align:center
I thought she had a cute design
when I created the dungeon

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:39.064 position:50% align:center
so I figured the
thirteenth floor could use

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:41.233 position:50% align:center
a Magimatic Maid.

00:15:41.316 --> 00:15:42.901 position:50% align:center
Because why the hell not?

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:47.781 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Oh man, what's her name?

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:51.618 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Now. It's time to clean up.

00:15:52.661 --> 00:15:56.623 position:50% align:center
Do you remember anything
from those days? Well, Rose?

00:15:56.707 --> 00:15:58.876 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:02.087 position:50% align:center
My name is Diablo. No, wait.

00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:05.924 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I should say
I'm "@Diablo-13."

00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:13.390 position:50% align:center
[ROSE gasps]
Master?

00:16:14.266 --> 00:16:17.603 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
It's true, Rose. I've returned.

00:16:18.562 --> 00:16:23.734 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] I don't believe it.
You're finally here.

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:29.489 position:50% align:center
Good to have you home,
Master. Welcome back.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:16:37.039 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Way too bright.
Is this the treasure vault?

00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:49.843 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
So shiny and glittery!

00:16:49.927 --> 00:16:51.553 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Look at all that gold!

00:16:51.637 --> 00:16:54.389 position:50% align:center
It's a mountain of treasure!

00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
[SHERA gasps] I can't believe
you made this entire dungeon

00:16:58.936 --> 00:17:02.606 position:50% align:center
by yourself, Diablo!
Always full of surprises!

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.943 position:50% align:center
[REM] That explains why you knew
how to beat every floor.

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:07.444 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Close call.

00:17:07.528 --> 00:17:09.905 position:50% align:center
I'm just glad they aren't
accusing me of setting them up.

00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:11.615 position:50% align:center
How long should I
pretend not to notice

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:14.368 position:50% align:center
before you tell me
who that girl is?

00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:16.036 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Thank you for asking.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:19.665 position:50% align:center
My entire existence revolves
around serving my Master.

00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:22.918 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what kind of
base-born mare are you?

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:24.837 position:50% align:center
Sorry, what?

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.339 position:50% align:center
I don't remember including you
in this conversation.

00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
Is your name Diablo, too?

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:32.636 position:50% align:center
Master, may I please
have your permission

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:34.805 position:50% align:center
to destroy this vile being?

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:36.557 position:50% align:center
I dare you to
ask me that directly.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.434 position:50% align:center
How would you like
a taste of Asterismos?

00:17:39.518 --> 00:17:42.771 position:50% align:center
Stop! You're making
my mind hurt!

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.441 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] Master, I present
the White Ox Statue

00:17:46.525 --> 00:17:47.985 position:50% align:center
you've been searching for.

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:50.571 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO chuckles]
You certainly made us go through

00:17:50.654 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
enough trouble to get it.

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:55.409 position:50% align:center
And now that we have this,
we can save Lumachina, can't we?

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:58.537 position:50% align:center
I guess. What is she supposed
to do, just climb on board?

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.998 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised you don't know.

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:03.041 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Because all I know
how to do is click "use,"

00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:05.544 position:50% align:center
and that's not
an option right now.

00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:08.046 position:50% align:center
It's working. I can feel it.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.258 position:50% align:center
The warmth of God is
coming from this statue.

00:18:15.596 --> 00:18:17.014 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:22.603 --> 00:18:24.188 position:50% align:center

[panting]

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
Hey, Lumachina, do you
need some help over there?

00:18:35.032 --> 00:18:37.409 position:50% align:center
No thanks. [pants]

00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:39.703 position:50% align:center
I can... I can feel Him.

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:43.290 position:50% align:center
He's so close and so am I.

00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:46.335 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
That's what she said. Ew.

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:52.591 position:50% align:center
[gasps] It's so hot!
I feel dizzy.

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:58.472 position:50% align:center
Lumachina? Can you
hear me? [gasps]

00:18:58.555 --> 00:18:59.598 position:50% align:center
The marks.

00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:02.267 position:50% align:center
They look like they're
fading a little!

00:19:02.351 --> 00:19:06.146 position:50% align:center
Yes. I think they are.
That's the power of God.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
Wow. Oh look, they're
almost completely gone.

00:19:10.234 --> 00:19:11.652 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA gasps]

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:13.987 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to hurt you.

00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:18.617 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] It feels so, so
tingly and numb right there.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.246 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
You're okay. I've got you.

00:19:22.329 --> 00:19:24.414 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
And this is called 'healing'?

00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:28.335 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA panting]
The power of God is so strong.

00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:29.670 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Yeah, I can tell.

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:31.004 position:50% align:center
Look at all that bright light.

00:19:31.088 --> 00:19:33.715 position:50% align:center
It's steadily driving
itself inside you.

00:19:33.799 --> 00:19:36.635 position:50% align:center
It's almost complete.
Can you feel it?

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:42.224 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA gasps]
Oh, yes! Yes!

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:44.351 position:50% align:center
God has entered me at last!

[SHERA] Yeah! That new
outfit is so cool!

00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:08.333 position:50% align:center
Well would you expect
anything less from a Demon Lord?

00:20:08.417 --> 00:20:09.710 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
We need to talk!

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:12.337 position:50% align:center
A skirt? It barely
covers anything!

00:20:12.421 --> 00:20:14.548 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Not only will it
improve your speed,

00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:17.259 position:50% align:center
but it will also help with
granting magic resistance.

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:18.510 position:50% align:center
Be grateful and accept it.

00:20:18.594 --> 00:20:19.761 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful, but...

00:20:19.845 --> 00:20:21.388 position:50% align:center
It looks adorable!

00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:24.183 position:50% align:center
But I missed the part where we
discovered you're a girl, Horn!

00:20:24.266 --> 00:20:25.642 position:50% align:center
[HORN gasps]

00:20:25.726 --> 00:20:28.061 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Um. Is this some kind of prank?

00:20:28.145 --> 00:20:30.898 position:50% align:center
It's just scraps of fabric
and chrome chips.

00:20:30.981 --> 00:20:32.274 position:50% align:center
Where's the rest of it?

00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:34.359 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Actually,
it grants physical defense,

00:20:34.443 --> 00:20:36.320 position:50% align:center
magic resistance, and speed.

00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:40.032 position:50% align:center
And that ring has the power
to strengthen your Summons.

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:41.783 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sure.

00:20:41.867 --> 00:20:43.577 position:50% align:center
Are you snubbing rare items?

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.414 position:50% align:center
[REM] Maybe. I need
a minute to process.

00:20:47.497 --> 00:20:50.834 position:50% align:center
No fair! You got everybody
else new outfits!

00:20:50.918 --> 00:20:53.045 position:50% align:center
All I ever got were some
ragged Tempest Arrows!

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
Not up to me.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.757 position:50% align:center
At your current level,
that's what you can use.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.634 position:50% align:center
Aww.

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Wow, look how pretty!

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.555 position:50% align:center
Hey, can I please have this?

00:21:03.639 --> 00:21:06.642 position:50% align:center
Sure. Whatever
lights your fire.

00:21:07.768 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? Horn?

00:21:08.936 --> 00:21:11.605 position:50% align:center
Uh, nothing!
Everything's terrific!

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
So shiny!

00:21:16.235 --> 00:21:19.988 position:50% align:center
[sighs] It's almost time to...

00:21:20.072 --> 00:21:22.449 position:50% align:center
Rose? Is something
bothering you?

00:21:22.533 --> 00:21:24.034 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
No, sir.

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:27.037 position:50% align:center
Granting my master's wishes is
what I consider my greatest joy.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
But I can't help
that watching you

00:21:29.373 --> 00:21:32.167 position:50% align:center
share your treasures
with these other girls is...

00:21:32.251 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center
...making me feel so very
crazy and envious of them!

00:21:41.385 --> 00:21:43.011 position:50% align:center
I used to be the only one.

00:21:43.095 --> 00:21:47.099 position:50% align:center
I long for the days when you
adored me--and only me.

00:21:47.182 --> 00:21:48.934 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
She's right.

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:52.020 position:50% align:center
She was the first and
only for a long time.

00:22:04.533 --> 00:22:05.534 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Gorgeous.

00:22:05.617 --> 00:22:07.452 position:50% align:center
This is the first item
I ever obtained

00:22:07.536 --> 00:22:09.663 position:50% align:center
when I was starting out.

00:22:10.873 --> 00:22:14.042 position:50% align:center
Would you like me to place this
in the vault for you, Master?

00:22:14.126 --> 00:22:16.628 position:50% align:center
No. It's not to manage.

00:22:16.712 --> 00:22:20.424 position:50% align:center
It's a, come on,
you know. A gift.

00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:23.427 position:50% align:center
One bestowed upon you
by the Demon Lord himself!

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.470 position:50% align:center
[ROSE gasps]

00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:31.685 position:50% align:center
So, you're giving it to me?

00:22:31.768 --> 00:22:33.228 position:50% align:center
Do you mean that?

00:22:33.312 --> 00:22:35.272 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Uh. Yeah.

00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:38.942 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Master.

00:22:39.026 --> 00:22:41.612 position:50% align:center
I'll treasure it.

00:22:41.695 --> 00:22:42.863 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Much better.

00:22:42.946 --> 00:22:45.324 position:50% align:center
You should be able to
carry it with you now.

00:22:45.407 --> 00:22:47.784 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] Yes! And now
we can finally save those

00:22:47.868 --> 00:22:50.120 position:50% align:center
afflicted by the
Death Knell Disease!

00:22:50.204 --> 00:22:51.330 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Let's head to the city!

00:22:51.413 --> 00:22:52.915 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
I wouldn't if I were you.

00:22:52.998 --> 00:22:55.000 position:50% align:center
It's pointless to
take it there now.

00:22:55.083 --> 00:22:57.753 position:50% align:center
I don't see how it
would be pointless?

00:22:57.836 --> 00:23:00.255 position:50% align:center
As of right now,
the Demon Lord's Army

00:23:00.339 --> 00:23:03.217 position:50% align:center
is heading toward
Zircon Tower City.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.426 position:50% align:center
[HENRICK]
Reporting!

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.595 position:50% align:center
Half of the people have
finished evacuating!

00:23:06.678 --> 00:23:09.014 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS] We're going
too slow! Let's speed it up!

00:23:09.097 --> 00:23:10.349 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 5A]
Reporting!

00:23:10.432 --> 00:23:13.143 position:50% align:center
The Demon Lord's Army is
five thousand melds away!

00:23:13.227 --> 00:23:16.230 position:50% align:center
Roughly three hundred large
monsters have been spotted!

00:23:17.356 --> 00:23:18.774 position:50% align:center
You have time.

00:23:18.857 --> 00:23:21.276 position:50% align:center
I'll be by to collect you
the night of the next full moon.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.487 position:50% align:center
Well, so much for
the next full moon.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.447 position:50% align:center
Pathetic liar.

00:23:26.657 --> 00:23:27.908 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS]
They have three hundred Fallen

00:23:27.991 --> 00:23:30.160 position:50% align:center
against our four
thousand soldiers.

00:23:30.244 --> 00:23:32.579 position:50% align:center
This won't be an easy fight!

00:23:40.379 --> 00:23:43.257 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] The Demon Lord's Army?
Are you kidding me?

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.467 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Whose genius idea was this?

00:23:45.551 --> 00:23:47.845 position:50% align:center
The city needs us. But we...

00:23:47.928 --> 00:23:50.681 position:50% align:center
We're going to lose so many.

00:23:50.764 --> 00:23:53.433 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I don't have a clue
what they're freaking out about.

00:23:53.517 --> 00:23:59.064 position:50% align:center
However, saving a city under
attack is an RPG staple!

00:23:59.147 --> 00:24:01.275 position:50% align:center
We're not backing down!

00:24:02.651 --> 00:24:04.653 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS]
Someone, please, save them!

00:24:04.736 --> 00:24:06.446 position:50% align:center
My soldiers! My people!

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:07.906 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS]
How dare you!

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.908 position:50% align:center
There's no escaping
your death this time!

00:24:09.992 --> 00:24:11.660 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Return everything to white.

00:24:11.743 --> 00:24:13.453 position:50% align:center
White Nova!
