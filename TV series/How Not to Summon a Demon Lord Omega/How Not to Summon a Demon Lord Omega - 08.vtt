00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:19.644 position:50% align:center
[REM] It's too much.
I can't hold on for much longer.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:27.318 position:50% align:center
--Rem, just breathe!
--Is she okay?

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:31.906 position:50% align:center
Oh no. Lean over the rail!
I'll hold your hair!

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.867 position:50% align:center
I feel so bad for her.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.827 position:50% align:center
Don't. It happens all the time.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.039 position:50% align:center
[HORN] I've never seen motion
sickness that extreme.

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:41.332 position:50% align:center
[REM]
I'm too young for this.

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:45.045 position:50% align:center
[gasps] There it is!
Right in front of us!

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.798 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
So that's the royal capital.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Seven Wall.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.262 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 8A]
What business have you here?

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:57.807 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 8B]
A suspicious man with horns?

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.476 position:50% align:center
You're not a Fallen, are you?

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.062 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Seriously?
They're surrounding us?

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.521 position:50% align:center
I really don't need
this kind of drama

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:05.398 position:50% align:center
while Lumachina's with us.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:08.193 position:50% align:center
You there! Tell us your name.

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:10.445 position:50% align:center
Remove your hood
and reveal your face!

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:13.698 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Okay fine.
They asked for this, though.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.786 position:50% align:center
If you're pointing
those spears at me,

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.247 position:50% align:center
then I'm assuming you're
prepared for the consequences.

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:24.501 position:50% align:center
Right. You don't scare us!

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.420 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Don't. I'll be fine.

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:31.424 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I'm already balls deep.
No turning back now.

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.968 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Please stand back.

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:35.804 position:50% align:center
Let them through.

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:38.431 position:50% align:center
They mean us no harm.

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:40.058 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:41.976 position:50% align:center
I remember you.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.187 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] It's been quite
a long time, hasn't it?

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.689 position:50% align:center
But I received Rem's letter

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.066 position:50% align:center
and have been
anticipating your arrival.

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.859 position:50% align:center
Welcome, Diablo.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.611 position:50% align:center
Alicia?

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.787 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.413 position:50% align:center
I think my heart just stopped!

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:26.498 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
It's beautiful!

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:28.416 position:50% align:center
You can see the
whole capital from here!

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.335 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
And beyond that!

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:32.879 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] The inn is yours
to use however you like

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:34.798 position:50% align:center
for as long as you
plan to be here.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.800 position:50% align:center
Hold on. What's the catch?

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center
Not that I'm questioning
your intentions, but...

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.221 position:50% align:center
If we stay here even one day,

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:42.639 position:50% align:center
we're going to
run out of money fast.

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:45.100 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] You don't have to
worry about any of that.

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:47.435 position:50% align:center
I'll be glad to take care of
your accommodations.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.853 position:50% align:center
[REM]
What? Really?

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
Yes. Anything for Diablo.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:54.401 position:50% align:center
If he wanted me to buy
the entire inn, I would.

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:57.028 position:50% align:center
What? For real?

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:58.738 position:50% align:center
Rem, are you okay?

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:00.573 position:50% align:center
Thanks. That's nice to hear.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:04.494 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] The entire inn?
Just how rich are you, Alicia?

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:05.578 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me.

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:06.871 position:50% align:center
Where are my manners?

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:09.374 position:50% align:center
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:12.502 position:50% align:center
I am Alicia Cristela,
an Imperial Knight.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.379 position:50% align:center
It's an honor to meet you.

00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
Thank you for
assisting us with that.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.882 position:50% align:center
It's much appreciated.

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:20.093 position:50% align:center
It is quite an honor
to serve you.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:23.138 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] Excuse me.
I need to know the truth

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:26.391 position:50% align:center
about your relationship
with my master.

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:27.892 position:50% align:center
And who are you?

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.020 position:50% align:center
I am his servant, Rose.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
My entire existence
is to serve my master.

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.734 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
This can't be good!

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:38.737 position:50% align:center
Alicia is a Demon Lord worshiper
who put our lives in danger

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.448 position:50% align:center
to resurrect the
Demon Lord before.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Even though she's sworn
her loyalty to me these days,

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:47.287 position:50% align:center
Rose can't find out about it!

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
Rose, you don't need to pry.

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:50.957 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
I'll put it this way.

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:54.169 position:50% align:center
If he asked me to die for him,
I wouldn't ask why.

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:56.254 position:50% align:center
Does that answer your question?

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Perhaps.

00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:59.466 position:50% align:center
Would I be right to
assume you identify

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:02.427 position:50% align:center
as one of my
master's possessions?

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50% align:center
You would unless
he has forsaken me.

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
Understood. Thank you.

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:10.643 position:50% align:center
You've been a big help.

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:14.064 position:50% align:center
Now that I know who you are,
I can act appropriately.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.733 position:50% align:center
You're the best.
So that leaves you.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:19.110 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna guess you're Horn?

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.695 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Wow! Smooth!

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50% align:center
I didn't know how she was
gonna get past Rose.

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:24.616 position:50% align:center
But she's got skills!

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:27.952 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
I can't do it anymore.

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:29.662 position:50% align:center
Farewell, cruel world!

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:33.416 position:50% align:center
And thank you. For everything.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:36.961 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
I'm so full!

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:38.963 position:50% align:center
I'm about to have food triplets!

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
I know how you feel!

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:41.508 position:50% align:center
You guys are gross.

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.843 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid there's nothing
I can do about that.

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:45.345 position:50% align:center
I want to be strong.

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:47.347 position:50% align:center
I thought I could eat enough
to be more like you, Mister.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.265 position:50% align:center
I just want to help more.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.767 position:50% align:center
Too bad you're
a Grasswalker and you're

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.895 position:50% align:center
cursed to live your life
looking like an embryo.

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:55.897 position:50% align:center
Thanks for crushing
my dreams, Rem.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
It's no big deal.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
As long as you're
faithful to me.

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] If Master would desire,
although it pains me to share,

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:05.115 position:50% align:center
I do know a way
to empower her more.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
It's a little complex,
so make sure you're up for it.

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:10.453 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Empower me how?

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:13.915 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] First, place this
treasure around your neck.

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:16.501 position:50% align:center
It will form a Master-Servant
Pact with my master,

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:19.129 position:50% align:center
and the Servant will develop
a strength of her own.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.297 position:50% align:center
A Master-Servant Pact, huh?

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.800 position:50% align:center
Wow! That sounds lovely!

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:26.052 position:50% align:center
I'll be in a pact with Diablo!

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
Hold on a minute.

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:29.806 position:50% align:center
Doesn't the servant
in that pact die?

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.016 position:50% align:center
If he dies, they both do?

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Please let me go to heaven!

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.312 position:50% align:center
[HORN] Wait! What do you mean
I'm gonna die?

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.356 position:50% align:center
Is that a problem for you?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.651 position:50% align:center
In exchange for having access
to my master's power?

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.069 position:50% align:center
Becoming his servant provides

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.905 position:50% align:center
more benefits than
words can explain.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.782 position:50% align:center
I'd become that powerful?

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:50.035 position:50% align:center
But I could also die.

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:51.536 position:50% align:center
Listen carefully. Horn.

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:54.539 position:50% align:center
Once you make that pact,
you're completely locked in.

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:56.374 position:50% align:center
Also, how are you
supposed to find work

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:59.919 position:50% align:center
or a partner for the future
with a collar around your neck?

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:08.845 position:50% align:center
It's a big deal.
What'll you do?

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.015 position:50% align:center
Well? Horn?

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.017 position:50% align:center
Still thinking.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.436 position:50% align:center
Right. Take your time.

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.484 position:50% align:center
I've decided I want this back.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.486 position:50% align:center
The more that I think about it,
the less I like the idea

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:27.238 position:50% align:center
of your kind being
near my master!

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] I've taken
the liberty of arranging

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
sleeping chambers
for each of you.

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:33.703 position:50% align:center
It might be a little cramped
in here for you, Diablo.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:34.913 position:50% align:center
My apologies.

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:36.915 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Thank you.
It won't be a problem.

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:40.001 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] It looks
just like a king's bedroom.

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:43.922 position:50% align:center
Well, it seems you've already
surmised the situation.

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:46.341 position:50% align:center
Yes. May I come closer?

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50% align:center
I have something serious
to discuss with you.

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:50.387 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's fine.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.931 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Thank you, sir.

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.225 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
What the?

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.394 position:50% align:center
Why does she have to
be this close?

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.270 position:50% align:center
The reason that you came here.

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
It's because of
Lumachina, isn't it?

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.274 position:50% align:center
Yes. It's true.

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:06.069 position:50% align:center
The king still has no clue
about what I've done.

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:08.279 position:50% align:center
No idea that I helped
resurrect Klem.

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:09.781 position:50% align:center
I was only held responsible

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
for my absence
during the emergency.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.993 position:50% align:center
So I'm currently
under confinement.

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:15.578 position:50% align:center
But give me a chance.

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:18.665 position:50% align:center
I know I can prove myself
useful to you, Diablo.

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:21.626 position:50% align:center
I wanna know every
detail you can share.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I knew it!
She's a virgin killer!

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:26.589 position:50% align:center
She makes herself look
wholesome and innocent

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:28.341 position:50% align:center
so people don't know
they're being hypnotized

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.635 position:50% align:center
by her feminine charms!

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:32.679 position:50% align:center
Alicia the virgin killer!

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:34.264 position:50% align:center
Never saw that one coming!

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
The room got cold.
Where'd you go?

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
[HORN] Sorry. It just
felt like it was too big.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it wasn't comfortable
in there, either.

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:43.440 position:50% align:center
How 'bout a slumber party?

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:45.483 position:50% align:center
Sounds fun!

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] You know the
Head Cardinal, Vishos?

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.449 position:50% align:center
He's decided to hunt
and slaughter Lumachina.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
The mortal races are disgusting.

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:57.120 position:50% align:center
Even the Church that
claims to believe in God.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:58.204 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Naturally, we'll need to

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:00.540 position:50% align:center
make them pay for their crimes.

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:02.792 position:50% align:center
Yes. I agree with that.

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:06.963 position:50% align:center
I can gather evidence of wrong
doings as requested. However.

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
I doubt they'll be willing
to openly admit guilt.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.968 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by that?

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:14.054 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] The kingdom
is unable to interfere

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:16.056 position:50% align:center
in the Church's
internal affairs.

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center
Therefore, it won't
be able to sentence

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:20.810 position:50% align:center
Vishos and the other Cardinals.

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.439 position:50% align:center
Does that make sense?

00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:27.108 position:50% align:center
This is why we need
your power, Diablo.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:28.485 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.528 position:50% align:center
Enact a bloody purge!

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:32.072 position:50% align:center
Use your magic, Diablo!

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:33.990 position:50% align:center
Bring the iron hammer
of justice down

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center
upon those villains
in human skin.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:39.287 position:50% align:center
Together we can restore
this world to its proper state!

00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:40.622 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO gasps]

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:43.833 position:50% align:center
And together, we can
bring them to their demise!

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.544 position:50% align:center
Please! I'm begging you!

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:51.841 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] It's official!
This woman is crazy!

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:56.262 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me
for being so rude.

00:09:56.346 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
I will continue doing everything
I can to investigate the Church.

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Great.

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I'm frikkin beat.
Time for beddy bye.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:13.988 position:50% align:center
Diablo, you're so silly...

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.539 position:50% align:center
What? What are you doing?

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:25.083 position:50% align:center
I apologize. I didn't
mean to wake you.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.086 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Are you letting
your magic recharge?

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:29.087 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.214 position:50% align:center
I can recharge
in one of two ways.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:35.051 position:50% align:center
Either by relaxing in the
dungeon or here by your side.

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:36.720 position:50% align:center
Up until now,
I've received my magic

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:39.639 position:50% align:center
a bit at a time by
staying close to you.

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:42.809 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
And finally. Beep, beep!

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:45.020 position:50% align:center
My charge is currently
at 30 percent.

00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:48.189 position:50% align:center
I highly recommend switching
to low-power mode.

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50% align:center
That's the point
I'm at currently.

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:53.361 position:50% align:center
And why didn't you say
something to me sooner?

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:56.239 position:50% align:center
The last thing I wanted to do
was burden you with this fact.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:59.367 position:50% align:center
So every night,
I'd wait for you to go to bed.

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:01.745 position:50% align:center
And quietly rest at your side.

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:05.623 position:50% align:center
Apparently I don't recharge
when you're asleep, though.

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:08.626 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] You've been there
this entire time?

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.503 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
There is another way.

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:14.799 position:50% align:center
I... I, um...

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:17.260 position:50% align:center
I propose we use
high-speed charging!

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:18.553 position:50% align:center
What's "high-speed"?

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.221 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
Well, in just 30
quick minutes of action,

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
I can recover
a week's energy. [gasps]

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:29.314 position:50% align:center
No wait. I meant to
say "magic power."

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:32.400 position:50% align:center
Right. So tell me
what we need to do.

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:35.987 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Um. Sure.

00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:38.948 position:50% align:center
I can receive magic power
from you through contact!

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.659 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Contact? Right.

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.912 position:50% align:center
Where should we do this?
Does the bed work?

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
I don't think that's
a good idea.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Seriously?

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.250 position:50% align:center
I just asked a girl
to come to bed with me

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:51.836 position:50% align:center
and she shot me down?

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.589 position:50% align:center
It's just that I'm kind of heavy
and I might break the bed.

00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Aw geez, that's right.

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:58.301 position:50% align:center
She's mechanical.
Made of metal.

00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:01.888 position:50% align:center
All right. So then tell me
what you want me to do.

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:05.558 position:50% align:center
Um, could you give me
a minute? I'm thinking.

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:11.773 position:50% align:center
What's going on, Rose?
You don't have to do that!

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:15.694 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA gasps]

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:19.489 position:50% align:center
Master, will you
please do me a favor

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.032 position:50% align:center
and charge me like this?

00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:23.702 position:50% align:center
Please bless me with
your magic power.

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
We're going to make
such a great team.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.162 position:50% align:center
Rose! Come on.

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.915 position:50% align:center
Is this really
necessary for power?

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.000 position:50% align:center
I don't really know.

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.710 position:50% align:center
I've never done
anything like it before.

00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:33.461 position:50% align:center
I just figured you had.

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
But I know I'm supposed to
have a part of your body.

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:41.177 position:50% align:center
You know, like a part that
could make contact with mine.

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:44.848 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] A part?
What the hell is she saying?

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.561 position:50% align:center
Right. Prepare yourself, then.

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
She's so soft.

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:57.277 position:50% align:center
Uh, what do I do now?

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:04.576 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Maybe touch here? Or here?

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:11.458 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
That's it! Wow!

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I'll just do it
the same way I did

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:16.212 position:50% align:center
when I poured magic into Rem!

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:20.925 position:50% align:center
[ROSE gasping]

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:22.594 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Okay, Rose, you ready?

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:23.803 position:50% align:center
Here it goes!

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:25.555 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Yes!

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:26.806 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.684 position:50% align:center
My master!

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:43.073 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Um. Okay? What's wrong?

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:45.909 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
Beep, beep.

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:49.287 position:50% align:center
Charge is currently
at 120 percent.

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:54.793 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Oh man.
Guess she's all filled up now?

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.503 position:50% align:center
Good for her.

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:00.006 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Take a look.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.633 position:50% align:center
These are the records
of the Church's

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:04.302 position:50% align:center
financial dealings for
these past few years.

00:14:04.386 --> 00:14:06.846 position:50% align:center
And evidence of their
various wrongdoings.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.683 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] You gathered
all of this? Please explain.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:10.892 position:50% align:center
Bribes work.

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:12.143 position:50% align:center
I bought off the White Masks

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:14.145 position:50% align:center
and they seemed
very happy to help.

00:14:14.229 --> 00:14:15.480 position:50% align:center
Bribe? How so?

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.107 position:50% align:center
You know who she's
talking about?

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.318 position:50% align:center
Yes. They're believers
of extraordinary faith

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
and permitted to
enter the sanctuary.

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
How did you manage to do that?

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:27.742 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
It was ironically easy.

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:29.452 position:50% align:center
I told them I had
money to spend on

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:32.497 position:50% align:center
evidence of bribery and
they quickly complied.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.542 position:50% align:center
In these documents,
it shows Vishos and others

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:39.170 position:50% align:center
using the donations from
believers as personal funds.

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:40.797 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with people?

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.965 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
That's not all.

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:44.426 position:50% align:center
Just as Vishos has
tried to kill Lumachina,

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:46.094 position:50% align:center
I've discovered that
he has already killed

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:49.180 position:50% align:center
many who got in their way.

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:51.016 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.518 position:50% align:center
What? That's awful!
Killing is bad!

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.729 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
I'm sorry, God.

00:14:55.812 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center
How sad for His own servants to
have taken the lives of others.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.110 position:50% align:center
How did I not know?

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:04.779 position:50% align:center
I've failed as a leader.

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:09.617 position:50% align:center
You've done a great job.

00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:11.327 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Not true!

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.538 position:50% align:center
I'm angry. I'm mad. I'm hurt!

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:15.665 position:50% align:center
And I hate this.

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:18.668 position:50% align:center
Now, do you understand
why I'm on edge?

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:21.796 position:50% align:center
The mortal races are
vile and disgusting.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.091 position:50% align:center
Ruin is the only true
path to their salvation!

00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:28.261 position:50% align:center
This world needs to be
culled by a Demon Lord!

00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50% align:center
Now bring on the bloody purge--!

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:30.805 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Stop that!

00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
Ow. Sorry.

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:34.642 position:50% align:center
The worst part is
that even though

00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
we have all this evidence,

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
the law is claiming
they cannot punish him.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:41.691 position:50% align:center
We need to use
your power, Diablo.

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:42.901 position:50% align:center
Of course you do.

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50% align:center
I'm not surprised.

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
But I hope you don't expect this
to be the simpler option.

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:48.823 position:50% align:center
Is it finally time to fight?

00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:50.825 position:50% align:center
You ready to take on the Church?

00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:53.203 position:50% align:center
Yep! They won't
get away with this!

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:54.079 position:50% align:center
[HORN gasps]

00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:56.998 position:50% align:center
Wait, Diablo sir, don't go yet.

00:15:57.999 --> 00:15:59.834 position:50% align:center
I want to fight
on your side again!

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:02.796 position:50% align:center
Please consider
giving me another chance.

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:04.631 position:50% align:center
How would you contribute?

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:06.925 position:50% align:center
I'll go directly
to the Cathedral.

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.718 position:50% align:center
I'll present all the evidence.

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:11.262 position:50% align:center
Vishos and his subordinates
will be caught,

00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:13.973 position:50% align:center
and then excommunicated.

00:16:14.057 --> 00:16:16.142 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] She still insists
on punishing those jerks

00:16:16.226 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center
through proper means.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:21.231 position:50% align:center
Figures. That's just
the kind of woman she is.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:22.982 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Diablo, sir?

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:26.486 position:50% align:center
I approve! Do it
and see what happens!

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:28.863 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Pardon me, Head Priest,

00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:31.700 position:50% align:center
this is as far as I can go
with you for right now.

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:34.869 position:50% align:center
But I'd like to ask you
one final question.

00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:36.413 position:50% align:center
I want to know if you believe

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
the mortal races
are worth saving.

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:44.754 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] I believe that
that is for God to decide.

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:46.756 position:50% align:center
But what makes me happy
is when people

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.801 position:50% align:center
are able to live with a sense
of gratitude and salvation.

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center
Their hearts are free.

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:54.973 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:58.810 position:50% align:center
The church is only
six blocks away from the inn.

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
These are the outfits
worn by believers.

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:03.231 position:50% align:center
If you wear them,
you should be able to

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:07.318 position:50% align:center
get close to the sanctuary
without any trouble.

00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:09.195 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Once we cross this bridge,

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:11.072 position:50% align:center
we'll be in
the church's district.

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
While there's no roof,
it's filled with warmth.

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:17.954 position:50% align:center
It's as holy of a place
as you'd expect for a cathedral.

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:20.832 position:50% align:center
Those who live here
and those who work here

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:23.293 position:50% align:center
are all ardent believers.

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:27.005 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
That's the cathedral?

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:30.925 position:50% align:center
[HORN] It's way less thrilling
than I expected. Amiright?

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:33.053 position:50% align:center
No, look up.

00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:37.098 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.768 position:50% align:center
Whoa, look how huge it is!

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:43.438 position:50% align:center
It's floating!
Why's it in the sky?

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.065 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] Vishos and
his subordinates are

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:46.733 position:50% align:center
up there in the clouds, too.

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:48.068 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
How do we get to them?

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:49.611 position:50% align:center
We'll use the floating passage.

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:52.947 position:50% align:center
[SANRO]
Pardon me, but are you pilgrims?

00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:55.450 position:50% align:center
Please, allow me to
offer you my prayers.

00:17:55.533 --> 00:17:57.327 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, we're in a hurry.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:01.039 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Are you intentionally
turning down prayers?

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:06.044 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
What is wrong with me?

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:09.964 position:50% align:center
I talked to him like he was
one of those annoying salesmen.

00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:12.217 position:50% align:center
[REM] Please forgive me
if this sounds rude.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.719 position:50% align:center
We've just traveled here from
the old Demon Lord's Domain

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
and our brains are mushed.

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:18.848 position:50% align:center
But we're eager for the
next step on our journey.

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center
You did travel quite a long way!

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:23.103 position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone!
Let's offer prayers

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:24.854 position:50% align:center
to these believers
who have just returned

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:26.564 position:50% align:center
from the Demon Lord's Domain.

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:29.943 position:50% align:center
What a great opportunity for us
to build our faith together!

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:31.194 position:50% align:center
Go get 'em.

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:33.196 position:50% align:center
Diablo, sir?

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:34.864 position:50% align:center
You should know
that to the faithful,

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center
prayers are just as
important as breathing.

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:46.960 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Time to pack your bags.
We're going on a guilt trip.

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.429 position:50% align:center
It's Vishos.

00:18:57.512 --> 00:18:58.680 position:50% align:center
[MAN 8B]
Look, it's Mister Vishos!

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:00.974 position:50% align:center
[MAN 8A]
I knew he'd return soon.

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:04.561 position:50% align:center
Vishos is back.

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:16.865 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS] Well isn't this a
pleasant surprise. Welcome home.

00:19:16.948 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center
We've been waiting for you,
Head Priest Lumachina.

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:29.586 position:50% align:center
What? That woman from earlier
was the Head Priest?

00:19:33.757 --> 00:19:35.300 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 8A]
It's the Head Priest!

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
--[BELIEVER 8A] What a miracle!
--[BELIEVER 8B] The Head Priest!

00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:42.474 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] Vishos,
I paid a visit to Zircon Tower

00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:44.517 position:50% align:center
where someone tried to kill me.

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center
That's absolutely
terrible, dear!

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:50.315 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
The man was the Paladin, Gewalt.

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:53.526 position:50% align:center
Vishos, I know that assassin
was sent by you!

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.904 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVERS gasp]

00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:57.781 position:50% align:center
And now, the carriage behind me

00:19:57.864 --> 00:20:00.075 position:50% align:center
is filled with evidence
I've gathered.

00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:02.452 position:50% align:center
It shows that all of you
have killed many members,

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:04.788 position:50% align:center
along with financial
records of bribery.

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:06.748 position:50% align:center
These are punishable actions.

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:08.958 position:50% align:center
It is my belief that
Head Cardinal Vishos

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
and every Cardinal
serving under him

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
are no longer worthy
of membership.

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:15.131 position:50% align:center
And are therefore
excommunicated.

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:16.341 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVERS gasp]

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:17.467 position:50% align:center
[MAN 8A]
Did she say excommunicated?

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.593 position:50% align:center
[MAN 8B]
That's it for Vishos!

00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:20.887 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 8A]
I can't believe it!

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:21.930 position:50% align:center
Well said.

00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:24.015 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS]
How deplorable.

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:27.310 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS] It looks to me like
the duties of Head Priest

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:29.938 position:50% align:center
are far too much for
a young, growing woman

00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:32.315 position:50% align:center
who only wants to play.

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:33.900 position:50% align:center
After abandoning your duties

00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:36.152 position:50% align:center
and engaging in all
manner of debauchery,

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
you return with questionable

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:39.989 position:50% align:center
and uninspiring
individuals in tow.

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:41.991 position:50% align:center
You then waste loads
of time creating piles

00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:44.869 position:50% align:center
of fake evidence as an
attempt to cast us out?

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:46.162 position:50% align:center
How dare you.

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:48.832 position:50% align:center
My claims are neither
lies nor embellishments.

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:50.333 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you should look within--

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:53.461 position:50% align:center
You can't banish every single
Cardinal from the church!

00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:55.547 position:50% align:center
If that ridiculous demand
were to be honored,

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.841 position:50% align:center
the church would lose
all significance.

00:20:57.924 --> 00:20:59.759 position:50% align:center
It may as well be nonexistent.

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:01.553 position:50% align:center
The faith built up
by our believers

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:03.847 position:50% align:center
would lose all meaning!

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
No matter how great
the cost may be,

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.311 position:50% align:center
you must repent for
the sins you've committed!

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:12.522 position:50% align:center
You're absolutely right,
Head Priest--

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:14.941 position:50% align:center
Or should I say
former Head Priest!

00:21:15.025 --> 00:21:16.484 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:18.111 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS]
You've abandoned your duties

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:20.488 position:50% align:center
and hidden your
whereabouts for so long.

00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:21.823 position:50% align:center
And now, for some reason,

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:24.075 position:50% align:center
you seek to destroy the
very church that saved you

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:26.453 position:50% align:center
from your sloth and debauchery!

00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA gasps]
How could you?

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:31.249 position:50% align:center
Do you get this?

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:35.545 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and nothing
about it's good. Diablo?

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:40.508 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Lumachina. If you
get emotional now, you'll lose.

00:21:40.592 --> 00:21:43.053 position:50% align:center
Suck it up. You got this.

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:45.388 position:50% align:center
Stop. Don't cry.

00:21:51.102 --> 00:21:53.104 position:50% align:center
Lumachina Weselia!

00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:54.439 position:50% align:center
We request that you resign

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:56.107 position:50% align:center
from your position
as Head Priest

00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:59.652 position:50% align:center
and repent for your sin
of abandoning your duty!

00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:02.280 position:50% align:center
But how will I?

00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:06.743 position:50% align:center
Now! Seize this sinner
and her companions!

00:22:18.421 --> 00:22:20.548 position:50% align:center
Wow! There are so many Paladins!

00:22:20.632 --> 00:22:22.592 position:50% align:center
What exactly do we need to do?

00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:23.802 position:50% align:center
My fellow believers,

00:22:23.885 --> 00:22:26.805 position:50% align:center
this is turning into
a great act of faith.

00:22:26.888 --> 00:22:30.517 position:50% align:center
Please remove these
traitors from the premises!

00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:36.481 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Let go of me, you perv!

00:22:36.564 --> 00:22:38.608 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Diablo!

00:22:38.692 --> 00:22:40.568 position:50% align:center
No. I can't take this.

00:22:40.652 --> 00:22:43.279 position:50% align:center
I wanna go home!

00:22:48.535 --> 00:22:50.954 position:50% align:center
I don't want to do this,
but I have no choice.

00:22:51.037 --> 00:22:52.497 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
No, you mustn't.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.873 position:50% align:center
You lost the debate!

00:22:53.957 --> 00:22:56.334 position:50% align:center
Fighting's all
that's left for us.

00:22:57.168 --> 00:22:58.294 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:22:58.378 --> 00:23:00.880 position:50% align:center
But we should not bring
hate to a cathedral.

00:23:01.923 --> 00:23:04.175 position:50% align:center
Blood will not be spilled there!

00:23:06.928 --> 00:23:08.471 position:50% align:center
Are you sure about this?

00:23:08.555 --> 00:23:09.639 position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:23:09.723 --> 00:23:12.267 position:50% align:center
If it will save the others.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.394 position:50% align:center
Of course you say that.

00:23:14.477 --> 00:23:16.354 position:50% align:center
Then do it on your own!

00:23:16.438 --> 00:23:18.648 position:50% align:center
Learn to survive
on your own two feet!

00:23:18.732 --> 00:23:20.692 position:50% align:center
Lightning Strike!

00:23:24.988 --> 00:23:25.947 position:50% align:center
[PALADINS gasp]

00:23:26.031 --> 00:23:27.198 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
If you don't want to die,

00:23:27.282 --> 00:23:29.617 position:50% align:center
then I suggest you make way!

00:23:33.663 --> 00:23:35.415 position:50% align:center
Thank you for the
prayers you offered.

00:23:35.498 --> 00:23:37.459 position:50% align:center
They meant a lot to me.

00:23:37.542 --> 00:23:40.795 position:50% align:center
May God's blessings be
upon all of you as well.

00:24:02.609 --> 00:24:04.986 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS] Soon even God
will be within my grasp!

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.780 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] I'll dole out
punishment to those of you

00:24:06.863 --> 00:24:08.490 position:50% align:center
who have lost faith in God!

00:24:08.573 --> 00:24:10.367 position:50% align:center
All of you can face
the same death!

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:14.037 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] Diablo, sir,
grant us judgment for our sins.
