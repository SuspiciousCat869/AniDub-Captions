00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:16.933 position:50% align:center
[EUROPA roars]

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.686 position:50% align:center
Oh my. That's nothing
but pure evil!

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.397 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Why is this
monster at the Church?

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.649 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS]
You call yourself a Demon Lord,

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.609 position:50% align:center
but you don't stand
a chance against me

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:29.195 position:50% align:center
now that I've become
one with God!

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.321 position:50% align:center
I know that voice!

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:31.531 position:50% align:center
It's Vishos!

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:32.782 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 10A]
I recognize that evil laugh.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.616 position:50% align:center
Is that?

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.909 position:50% align:center
Why's Vishos up there?

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:36.619 position:50% align:center
I don't believe it.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.414 position:50% align:center
Such a repulsive being couldn't
possibly join with God.

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:40.999 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS]
Don't test me, girlie!

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.334 position:50% align:center
You'll have proof soon enough

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:45.712 position:50% align:center
when you're facing this
god's judgement! [laughs]

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:49.132 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Heh. You call that God?

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.051 position:50% align:center
You truly are an idiot.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:54.387 position:50% align:center
Even Europa is simply a weapon
summoned by ritual magic!

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:57.223 position:50% align:center
Wait just a minute!
How do you know that?

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:58.600 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Well, because it was the boss of

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.643 position:50% align:center
a limited-time event
in <i>Cross Reverie</i> ,

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.479 position:50% align:center
so this calls for lies.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.272 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
I'm glad you asked!

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:07.734 position:50% align:center
It's because I'm a Demon Lord
from another world!

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:10.236 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS] Playing games,
you mysterious bastard?

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.614 position:50% align:center
Fine! It doesn't matter
who you are,

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:15.367 position:50% align:center
you will never beat Europa!

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:29.381 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Crap! Europa's attacks
aren't actually magic.

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:31.424 position:50% align:center
My Demon Lord's Ring
can't reflect them.

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.093 position:50% align:center
It may not be the same
as in the game,

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:36.805 position:50% align:center
so if I test it and it fails,
I'm completely screwed.

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:39.557 position:50% align:center
This is bad! This is
really really bad!

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.184 position:50% align:center
What's gonna happen to him?

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.061 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't ask.

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:46.773 position:50% align:center
Wow! That's a
raid boss, isn't it?

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.191 position:50% align:center
I'm collating data.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.901 position:50% align:center
He's the God of Destruction.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:52.153 position:50% align:center
Europa's level may
exceed two hundred.

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:53.613 position:50% align:center
Is that bad?

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:54.864 position:50% align:center
[REM]
It looked like it came out of

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.200 position:50% align:center
the bottom floor
of the sanctuary.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.953 position:50% align:center
Which means there must be
something down there!

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:01.955 position:50% align:center
Where are you going?

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:03.915 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS]
I would run if I were you,

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:06.543 position:50% align:center
you self-proclaimed Demon Lord!

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.004 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Damn it!

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:11.256 position:50% align:center
Explosion, go!

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.387 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I knew it.
Those are enchantments.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.681 position:50% align:center
He put his damn barrier up.

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:24.686 position:50% align:center
Now that I've become a God,
I'm invincible! [laughs]

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.062 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Vishos!

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.522 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS]
Lumachina!

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:28.815 position:50% align:center
Still at it.

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:31.026 position:50% align:center
How many acts of corruption
are you planning?

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.403 position:50% align:center
I won't stop until
I reach my goal.

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.947 position:50% align:center
To overpower the
God of this world!

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:40.118 position:50% align:center
And I think I'll
start with you! Die!

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:43.788 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:48.418 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:53.381 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS] They're gone?
Where the hell did they go?

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.219 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Diablo, you're bleeding!

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:01.264 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] This isn't good.
I've only played this game solo,

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:04.184 position:50% align:center
so I never picked up any spells
to protect someone else.

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.437 position:50% align:center
Shit! I took a ton
of damage from that, too.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.322 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS]
Damn it! Quit moving around!

00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center
Lumachina, there's something
I need you to do for me.

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:24.454 position:50% align:center
Yes. Sure. What?

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:27.374 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Dispel! You know
how to use it, don't you?

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:30.460 position:50% align:center
Um. The miracle? [gasps]

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:31.753 position:50% align:center
Yes! I can do it!

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:34.839 position:50% align:center
We have to eliminate
that defensive barrier.

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:37.884 position:50% align:center
It's the only way to
defeat him. Hold on.

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.386 position:50% align:center
He's about to destroy
the Demon Lord.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.262 position:50% align:center
This is it. I think
we'll be saved.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:44.808 position:50% align:center
It's true. Everything Vishos
told us was the truth!

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.476 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 10D]
He was right!

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:47.394 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 10E]
Please save us!

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:50.021 position:50% align:center
Quiet! That monsters' not God!

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:51.815 position:50% align:center
Would He destroy the sanctuary?

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.693 position:50% align:center
Would God try to harm
the Head Priest? Come on!

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:57.153 position:50% align:center
Those are both works
of a Demon Lord!

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.571 position:50% align:center
Trust Lumachina.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:03:59.989 position:50% align:center
She's the only one
who constantly

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.367 position:50% align:center
tries to share the word of God!

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.870 position:50% align:center
We should all have
faith in her! I do.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.208 position:50% align:center
[HORN] Um, where are Mister
Diablo and the others?

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:12.711 position:50% align:center
Wherever they are,
I hope Diablo's okay.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.337 position:50% align:center
I've located them.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:15.839 position:50% align:center
Look over there.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.967 position:50% align:center
Our dearest God
who art in Heaven,

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.177 position:50% align:center
please use your power
to ward off the wicked

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
who would bring harm and
misfortune to your children.

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
Cleanse their souls,
exorcise all disasters,

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.687 position:50% align:center
and grant them your love
and merciful forgiveness.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.523 position:50% align:center
Bless their lives
and purify them.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] A priest's miracles
are very powerful,

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.570 position:50% align:center
but they take a long
time to activate.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
Gotta keep her safe
while we wait.

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS cackles] Are you truly
planning to use Dispel?

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.161 position:50% align:center
How adorable!

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:50.248 position:50% align:center
Too bad there's no way
it'll be ready in time!

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
You stay back!

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
Leave my Master alone!
Or deal with me!

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
Wait, Rose!

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:02.302 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS]
What do you think you're doing?

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.054 position:50% align:center
Outta the way,
you pathetic puppet!

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:08.808 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] Nobody ever
calls me a puppet! Never!

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:11.144 position:50% align:center
Magimatic Sol!

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS]
You fool!

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center
[ROSE screams]

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.027 position:50% align:center
Rose, no!

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
No!

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.290 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Rose. Wake up!

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:34.084 position:50% align:center
What were you thinking?

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.837 position:50% align:center
[ROSE]
M-Master. You're safe.

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad. I, um...

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:48.390 position:50% align:center
You've done a great job.
Now just leave the rest to me.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
Wait. Is she okay?

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:55.563 position:50% align:center
Lumachina, even though
we know prayer doesn't work.

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
What? Right!

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center
Go Lightning... Arrow!

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:05.281 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS]
Stay out of my way, all of you!

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.867 position:50% align:center
Or else be eliminated!

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.707 position:50% align:center
Volcanic Wall!

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:18.378 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS]
It's no use!

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:26.386 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO screams]

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
Oh no. Poor Demon Lord.
Is God too powerful for you?

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.894 position:50% align:center
Do us all a favor and vanish

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:37.105 position:50% align:center
along with that
ancient sanctuary!

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:40.066 position:50% align:center
What a wonderful place
to build my castle!

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.528 position:50% align:center
A castle fit for
a brand-new God!

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:45.780 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Are we gonna die here?

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.867 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] Diablo, sir?
Everything is ready.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.953 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Thank you,
Lumachina. Release it all!

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:56.958 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] Right! Our God.
O sacred purification!

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS]
Don't be so naïve!

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.800 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS] I've invested far more
years into this than you have!

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:08.678 position:50% align:center
I refuse to lose to some girl!

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:12.140 position:50% align:center
[gasps] The power of God is so.

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:16.686 position:50% align:center
Is it her light that's
being pushed back?

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.314 position:50% align:center
At last! Die, Lumachina!

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.069 position:50% align:center
Not good. This is way bad.

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:26.738 position:50% align:center
We could run? Wanna run again?

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:28.907 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Look! It's everyone's prayers!

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.451 position:50% align:center
Up there! There are so many!

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.329 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
What are you talking about?

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:35.580 position:50% align:center
I can't see anything.

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:37.165 position:50% align:center
[BABALON] That figures,
you do strike me as

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.000 position:50% align:center
the type who wouldn't
believe in God.

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Huh? Uh...

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:47.425 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Beautiful. Like floating stars!

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:50.345 position:50% align:center
With this many prayers,
God has to hear them!

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.055 position:50% align:center
He has to!

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.018 position:50% align:center
It feels really warm
all of a sudden.

00:07:57.102 --> 00:08:00.188 position:50% align:center
That's elven royalty
for you! Lookin' good!

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:14.452 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Where is all this
light coming from?

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:16.746 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
From love.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.708 position:50% align:center
This is the light brought
about through prayer.

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50% align:center
The luminous power of faith.

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:23.253 position:50% align:center
Impossible!

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center
Everyone knows that
praying doesn't work!

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:27.590 position:50% align:center
It's a meaningless
waste of time!

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
You're wrong.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.471 position:50% align:center
God listens to the prayers
of all His people.

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:35.932 position:50% align:center
Even you in your
weakest moments.

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:38.893 position:50% align:center
O God, grant us
your purifying light!

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS]
Impossible!

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:46.985 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS screams]

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.074 position:50% align:center
Diablo.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.119 position:50% align:center
You'll pay for that!

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.871 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Well done, Lumachina!

00:08:57.954 --> 00:08:59.497 position:50% align:center
I'm proud of you.

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:03.293 position:50% align:center
Vishos! You've got nothing
protecting you now!

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Shining Lance
in my right hand,

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:11.343 position:50% align:center
and Darkness Lance in my left.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.554 position:50% align:center
We're not done. You just wait.

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:18.350 position:50% align:center
I'll pierce your soul with every
drop of my magic power!

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:20.352 position:50% align:center
Even with many
enchantments gone,

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:21.811 position:50% align:center
Europa, the God of Destruction

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:24.856 position:50% align:center
won't lose to a weak
Elemental Sorcerer!

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:26.649 position:50% align:center
See, that's where
you're confused.

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.485 position:50% align:center
Once Europa's lost
its enchantments,

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.612 position:50% align:center
there's nothing left of it.

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:32.113 position:50% align:center
Just a weak raid boss.

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:34.032 position:50% align:center
[gasps] A raid?

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:36.868 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Light and Dark
Composite Magic.

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:40.830 position:50% align:center
Come forth! Annihilation Sphere!

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:44.501 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO yells]

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:51.591 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS screaming]

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.303 position:50% align:center
That's what we like to hear!

00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:58.181 position:50% align:center
And now begone from this world!

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
Oh. Why are you here?

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center
Well. Look who it is.

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:33.008 position:50% align:center
It's been a while, hasn't it?

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:34.592 position:50% align:center
[REM]
You did all of this?

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:37.387 position:50% align:center
A living display of betrayal
from Paladin to Cardinal?

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.763 position:50% align:center
Yeah right.

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:41.599 position:50% align:center
I'm not a Paladin anymore,
my dear girl.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
Against my heart's desires.

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:45.520 position:50% align:center
Whatever. Then it's
your employer's.

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.689 position:50% align:center
Those sickos want
to see people silenced!

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:49.149 position:50% align:center
Permanently silenced!

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:52.027 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT] Clever interpretation
for such a dumb girl.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
You ready to die now?

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.237 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.322 position:50% align:center
Well. It doesn't matter.

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:58.324 position:50% align:center
It seems I owe you--or Lumachina

00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:01.119 position:50% align:center
a favor or two
from earlier anyway.

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:03.705 position:50% align:center
[REM]
What is this?

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
Have you ever heard
of the name Tria?

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.876 position:50% align:center
If so, then, take this.

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:18.678 position:50% align:center
Hello Diablo, sir.

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] We are ready for you
to grant us God's judgment.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.187 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Oh, crap, that's right.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.480 position:50% align:center
I did say something random about

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
passing God's judgment
on them and whatnot.

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
Idiot! I'll just have to find
some way out of this!

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:37.364 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO laughs]
Looks like you've finally

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:38.865 position:50% align:center
come to your senses!

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:41.576 position:50% align:center
At least this time,
you managed not to lose sight of

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.621 position:50% align:center
the God you really
should've been praying to!

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:47.999 position:50% align:center
Now, notice that emotion
swirling around in your heart?

00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:49.084 position:50% align:center
Remember it!

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:52.045 position:50% align:center
That is what
true faith feels like!

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:53.963 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Hope that wasn't too big of

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:56.049 position:50% align:center
a cheesy stretch for them.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.387 position:50% align:center
He's right. I feel it.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
I can feel the
strength and warmth

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.349 position:50% align:center
of God's love all over me.

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 10A]
Thank you, God!

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.560 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 10A]
I'm forever grateful to you!

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 10B]
Our faith will never waver!

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:12.857 position:50% align:center
Wow. Lumachina's so great!

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:17.487 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA gasps]
They totally bought it!

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.406 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Hmph. All right, then.

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:23.034 position:50% align:center
I hope you've learned enough
not to repeat the same mistake.

00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:24.619 position:50% align:center
But if you should fail again,

00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:28.456 position:50% align:center
I'll be back to burn you
with crimson and hellfire!

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.835 position:50% align:center
Right. Thank you, Diablo.

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:33.545 position:50% align:center
Crap. I'm done.

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:36.089 position:50% align:center
Magic is tapped out.

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:38.008 position:50% align:center
I think I'm falling.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.175 position:50% align:center
Yep, here goes.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:41.302 position:50% align:center
So wait. Mister Diablo's God?

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:43.179 position:50% align:center
Uh, how 'bout 'no'?

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I think he fell.

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:54.065 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Lumachina, is that you?

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:56.609 position:50% align:center
It is! You're safe, Tria!

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:58.445 position:50% align:center
I've missed you!

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:08.872 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] Thank you for
all your help last night,

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.373 position:50% align:center
every one of you.

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:12.208 position:50% align:center
I know it isn't much,
but I wanted to at least

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.501 position:50% align:center
show you my appreciation.

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:15.253 position:50% align:center
--Shiny!
--For real?

00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you sure?

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Positive.

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:19.591 position:50% align:center
Allow me to help with
your travel expenses.

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:20.550 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:22.635 position:50% align:center
Tell me. How's Rose doing?

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:26.014 position:50% align:center
No need to worry.
She's fast asleep.

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:30.185 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
That's good to hear.

00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:33.313 position:50% align:center
Go home. There's no need
for you to be here, right?

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:36.191 position:50% align:center
Wrong. The church
has a great deal of trust

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:38.234 position:50% align:center
to regain from the people here.

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:40.904 position:50% align:center
The Cardinals and Paladins
need to atone for their sins

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:43.406 position:50% align:center
and make things right
with the members, too.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.576 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] She wants them to atone
for mishaps within the church?

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:48.203 position:50% align:center
Doesn't church cancel that out?

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:49.871 position:50% align:center
I'm still investigating.

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:52.290 position:50% align:center
Vishos and the others must've
had financial backing.

00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center
It's the only way they could've
gotten away with this.

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:57.462 position:50% align:center
What's more, there's also
the matter of that monster.

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
Where did it come from?

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.924 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm pretty curious
about that, too.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:02.884 position:50% align:center
According to Rem's report,

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:06.554 position:50% align:center
Gewalt made sure to silence
Vishos' men permanently.

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:08.223 position:50% align:center
Which can only mean...

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:10.350 position:50% align:center
Whoever hired him is suspect.

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:11.559 position:50% align:center
Good call.

00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:12.936 position:50% align:center
I thought the only thing
you knew much about

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.479 position:50% align:center
was your religious stuff.

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:17.315 position:50% align:center
Well. I've still got
a lot to learn.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
I need to become
a better protector.

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:23.530 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] She's grown so much
stronger since we first met.

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:24.739 position:50% align:center
It's not just prayer.

00:14:24.823 --> 00:14:27.784 position:50% align:center
Many hardships will
fall upon the church.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.577 position:50% align:center
I need the faithful.

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:32.747 position:50% align:center
No, I need people I can rely on.

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:36.751 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Diablo, sir. Would you...

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:40.296 position:50% align:center
Would it be possible for you to
stay and remain with the church?

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.507 position:50% align:center
Stay and be Head Paladin?

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.136 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO laughs]

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:47.012 position:50% align:center
Diablo in church?

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:47.887 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:49.764 position:50% align:center
Paladin?

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:50.974 position:50% align:center
What are you thinking?

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:52.308 position:50% align:center
Would you want to?

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:53.601 position:50% align:center
Tria approves.

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:56.354 position:50% align:center
I'm sure the other
Paladins will as well.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] Please. We could
use a power like yours.

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Shut up. A Demon Lord
can't be a Paladin.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
More than that,
I'd have to work with others

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.949 position:50% align:center
and I hate group activities!

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:10.243 position:50% align:center
Ahem. Look, Lumachina,

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:12.120 position:50% align:center
I understand you need
help right now.

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:14.039 position:50% align:center
But I am not the one.

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:17.667 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:20.879 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
I know you're right.

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:22.714 position:50% align:center
Your power is far too great.

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:25.050 position:50% align:center
I don't know
what I was thinking.

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:28.261 position:50% align:center
If I were to rely on you,
I'd be just like Vishos.

00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:31.139 position:50% align:center
Using force to make
believers follow me.

00:15:31.222 --> 00:15:32.098 position:50% align:center
Is that what you're saying?

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:33.350 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:34.768 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Uh, no,
it's because I hate talking

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:37.145 position:50% align:center
in front of large crowds
like I had to do yesterday!

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:39.022 position:50% align:center
You've helped me work harder.

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:40.523 position:50% align:center
Thank you. I'm so grateful.

00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:42.734 position:50% align:center
Well. That's great.

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.235 position:50% align:center
Tell me something.

00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:46.363 position:50% align:center
Would you confirm
that you believe in me?

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:47.655 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Of course I do.

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
All right then.

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:51.284 position:50% align:center
What if I told you
that I'm not God?

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
If you were speaking your truth,

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:56.122 position:50% align:center
then I would believe you.

00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:57.916 position:50% align:center
Because I believe in you.

00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:00.502 position:50% align:center
And it has nothing to do
with titles or positions.

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:01.836 position:50% align:center
It's a feeling.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.006 position:50% align:center
I believe in the heart
and soul I've come to know.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.967 position:50% align:center
That's who I see now
instead of a God.

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:11.096 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:16.351 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO sighs] Nothing like a
bath after completing a quest!

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
Only one thing
could make it better.

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:21.606 position:50% align:center
If an item were to drop or I
scored a level up right now.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.525 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Diablo?

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
Yeah? What's up, Shera?

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:27.278 position:50% align:center
I just knew I'd
find you in the bath!

00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:28.571 position:50% align:center
Then why are we here?

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:30.615 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Is there something wrong?

00:16:30.699 --> 00:16:33.410 position:50% align:center
Sorry to bother you. We um...

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.745 position:50% align:center
We just weren't sure
where you ran off to.

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:37.789 position:50% align:center
These baths are phenomenal.

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:39.374 position:50% align:center
You should take one
if you have time.

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Really? You don't mind?

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:43.253 position:50% align:center
[REM] It's like you're
trying to look desperate.

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:44.754 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
No need to be shy, come on.

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
--[REM] What? Why?
--[SHERA] All right!

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.800 position:50% align:center
Let the maids know
what you need.

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:50.176 position:50% align:center
They'll bring hot water
to your rooms

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.095 position:50% align:center
if you'd rather bathe in there.

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:53.179 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Hurry, Rem!

00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:55.598 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Shut up!

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] It's bath time!
It's bath time!

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:03.773 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] Bath time's always
so much fun with Diablo!

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:07.235 position:50% align:center
Um, yeah, This is
so awkward, guys.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.616 position:50% align:center
[SHERA sighs]
You weren't kidding,

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.036 position:50% align:center
this feels great, Diablo!

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:19.414 position:50% align:center
What the? Um, something's
pushing my leg,

00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:21.666 position:50% align:center
and it's not your hand.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
Oh that's my foot!
I thought I was pushing Diablo!

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:27.922 position:50% align:center
No, I think she means me.

00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:29.174 position:50% align:center
Good times.

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:31.092 position:50% align:center
Could you move more
toward the center?

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:33.011 position:50% align:center
It's hard to breathe in here.

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:38.058 position:50% align:center
[SHERA gasps] Careful!
You pushed him towards me!

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.768 position:50% align:center
He's gonna get stuck.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:49.319 position:50% align:center
You just pushed him into me!
And um. Now he's too close!

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:52.030 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Well then, maybe.

00:17:52.113 --> 00:17:54.199 position:50% align:center
Maybe we should
push into him instead.

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:56.493 position:50% align:center
That way there are no surprises.

00:17:56.576 --> 00:18:00.497 position:50% align:center
Would that be okay
with you? Cause if not,

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.958 position:50% align:center
just ignore the elf
and her dumb ideas.

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:10.006 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I'm in love with
whoever invented other worlds!

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
You okay, Rem?

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
I thought you didn't feel
comfortable around carriages.

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:17.305 position:50% align:center
[REM]
I didn't. But I figured it out.

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center
As long as I'm holding the
reins, my stomach stays chill.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
[SHERA chuckles]

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:22.519 position:50% align:center
Are you positive?

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:24.854 position:50% align:center
You'll eventually have
your normal arm back?

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
After some time.

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:28.108 position:50% align:center
I'm equipped with
self-repair functions.

00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:30.694 position:50% align:center
They can activate as
long as I'm by your side.

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
Would that be okay
with you, Master?

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:35.824 position:50% align:center
Of course! Please stay!
I'd love it!

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:38.618 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't mind if you
traveled with me forever.

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:42.706 position:50% align:center
[gasps] These kind words are
much more than I deserve!

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
I'll engrave them in my memory

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:46.042 position:50% align:center
and play them on
an infinite loop!

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:49.170 position:50% align:center
Please. Infinite loops
should be banned.

00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:51.589 position:50% align:center
Can you believe how much
we experienced?

00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:53.633 position:50% align:center
We were supposed to just
escort Lumachina home

00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:55.844 position:50% align:center
to cast a spell, remember?

00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:57.512 position:50% align:center
[REM] Yeah, I know.
And then stupid Battuta

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.472 position:50% align:center
showed up and almost killed us.

00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:01.850 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] That curry was
the best I'd ever had!

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center
[REM] Then we joined the battle
against the Demon Lord's Army.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.980 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] The celebration feast we
had was delicious, wasn't it?

00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
[REM] After that, we were
captured by church members

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:10.316 position:50% align:center
and forced to battle Vishos.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.236 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] I can't get over how
good the food was at that inn!

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center
I think my breasts may have
filled out a little more.

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
Why do you make everything
about your boobs?

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:20.035 position:50% align:center
We could talk about yours
if it'll make you feel better?

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:21.119 position:50% align:center
They're really small.

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:23.455 position:50% align:center
That's weird for
Pantherians, right?

00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:26.499 position:50% align:center
[REM] I'm glad you're so proud
of your chest-fat, dumb elf!

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:27.959 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Hey!

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:30.628 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] By the way, Master,
should you have let her go?

00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:33.173 position:50% align:center
You'd only just
secured her as a servant.

00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's what's right.

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:38.636 position:50% align:center
[HORN] Um, I was thinking.
What if I stayed here?

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50% align:center
I want to go to school and
learn how to perform magic!

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:46.061 position:50% align:center
I... I want to become a
Sorcerer just like you, sir!

00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:52.275 position:50% align:center
Well, obviously I'll never be as
great as you, but still. Maybe.

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:54.110 position:50% align:center
You should do what pleases you.

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:57.781 position:50% align:center
[HORN gasps] Wow! I promise
I'll make you proud!

00:19:57.864 --> 00:20:02.494 position:50% align:center
I'm a little surprised.
Horn is a Thief of high-level.

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:04.204 position:50% align:center
Learning magic from
scratch could be

00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:06.122 position:50% align:center
a huge waste of time for her.

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:08.083 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd be against it.

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.210 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] I know it
would be ineffective,

00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
but that's exactly
the struggle she craves.

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:14.589 position:50% align:center
So I'll let her struggle.

00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:16.966 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!
You're the greatest!

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
Yay! Personal growth rules!

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:23.807 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
I always hated being shot down.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.475 position:50% align:center
I'm glad I don't have
to discourage anyone

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:26.851 position:50% align:center
who wants to take
a different path.

00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
[SHERA gasps]
Look! It's Faltra City!

00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center
[REM]
We made it! We're home!

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:40.907 position:50% align:center
[KLEM] Wow! Look at all that
sweet, fancy, deliciousness!

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.617 position:50% align:center
Nice change of pace, yes?

00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:45.954 position:50% align:center
Mortal food is expensive.
We can't afford to pay for it.

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
All the money's gone.
See? All gone.

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:53.878 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] I'm happy to take
care of today's lunch, okay?

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center
Really? You truly are the best!

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:59.050 position:50% align:center
In that case,
bring out the cookies!

00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:01.177 position:50% align:center
I want every single one of them!

00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:03.388 position:50% align:center
[SYLVIE]
Hmm. You seriously don't see it?

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:06.725 position:50% align:center
It's so obvious, none of
these expenses add up.

00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:09.436 position:50% align:center
How could I have
been so careless? Ahh!

00:21:09.519 --> 00:21:11.646 position:50% align:center
I'm supposed to be
protecting all women!

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.983 position:50% align:center
That's it!
I'm Emile Bichelberger!

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:17.360 position:50% align:center
I alone will fix the
Guild's wrecked finances!

00:21:17.444 --> 00:21:18.778 position:50% align:center
[SYLVIE]
Well isn't that cute?

00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:19.904 position:50% align:center
But not how it works.

00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:21.865 position:50% align:center
Just try not being lazy.

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:25.118 position:50% align:center
[SYLVIE] That goes for
you three as well!

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:29.414 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS]
Ah. So he pulled it off?

00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:31.583 position:50% align:center
That's as expected of Diablo.

00:21:31.666 --> 00:21:32.709 position:50% align:center
So, where is he now?

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.336 position:50% align:center
Oh! We have received word

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
that he's already
returned to Faltra.

00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:41.634 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS]
Really? Here in the city?

00:21:41.718 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I'll welcome him
home with a stiff drink.

00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:45.764 position:50% align:center
I hope he's matured.

00:21:45.847 --> 00:21:48.516 position:50% align:center
That runaway game
was so ridiculous.

00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:51.186 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Ta-da! What do you think?

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:52.354 position:50% align:center
Does it look good?

00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:55.857 position:50% align:center
Why yes, It looks lovely
on you, dear Horn.

00:21:57.609 --> 00:22:00.111 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] You know, I think now
would be the perfect time

00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:02.489 position:50% align:center
to start your elegance
and refinement training.

00:22:02.572 --> 00:22:04.616 position:50% align:center
How to be a lady. One who is

00:22:04.699 --> 00:22:06.826 position:50% align:center
worthy of a duke's
recommendation.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.245 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
What? Why?

00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:11.039 position:50% align:center
[TRIA] The repairs are
coming along quite steadily

00:22:11.122 --> 00:22:14.167 position:50% align:center
thanks to the cooperation of
our most faithful members.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.710 position:50% align:center
I'm delighted to hear that.

00:22:15.794 --> 00:22:17.087 position:50% align:center
I'm sure God is, too.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.005 position:50% align:center
Excellent work, everyone.

00:22:20.924 --> 00:22:23.468 position:50% align:center
I wonder if you
made it home safely.

00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:25.595 position:50% align:center
I miss you, Diablo.

00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:28.723 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:22:28.807 --> 00:22:30.266 position:50% align:center
Welcome! [gasps]

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:33.311 position:50% align:center
Hey, welcome back! Meow!

00:22:35.855 --> 00:22:38.066 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:39.776 position:50% align:center
You gave it to me!

00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:43.071 position:50% align:center
How could anyone forget
such a beautiful ring?

00:22:43.154 --> 00:22:44.614 position:50% align:center
Why would I give that to you?

00:22:44.698 --> 00:22:47.200 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] Because you
wanted to be with me?

00:22:49.494 --> 00:22:50.578 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
That's right!

00:22:50.662 --> 00:22:52.622 position:50% align:center
It's in the dungeon's
treasure vault!

00:22:52.706 --> 00:22:56.251 position:50% align:center
The item you have discovered
is an authentic engagement ring.

00:22:56.334 --> 00:22:57.502 position:50% align:center
I knew it!

00:22:57.585 --> 00:23:01.006 position:50% align:center
I promise to make you
eternally happy, Diablo!

00:23:02.132 --> 00:23:04.217 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Um. Hi?

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.511 position:50% align:center
Please don't mess this part up.

00:23:06.594 --> 00:23:08.346 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to have
two rings, remember?

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:10.181 position:50% align:center
Or you'll look like a douche.

00:23:10.265 --> 00:23:12.559 position:50% align:center
Try again. I'll wait.

00:23:12.642 --> 00:23:14.352 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
What the french-toast?

00:23:14.436 --> 00:23:16.104 position:50% align:center
Where'd you put it?

00:23:16.187 --> 00:23:18.148 position:50% align:center
You have one for me, right?

00:23:18.231 --> 00:23:21.526 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Nope! But I can't say that!

00:23:21.609 --> 00:23:22.819 position:50% align:center
There's only one!

00:23:22.902 --> 00:23:24.988 position:50% align:center
And I obtained it as
a reward through a quest!

00:23:25.071 --> 00:23:27.449 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's okay! I already
talked to Sylvie about

00:23:27.532 --> 00:23:30.076 position:50% align:center
giving us a quest
for another ring!

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.330 position:50% align:center
[gasps] So you're not being
a monopolizing troll?

00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:35.498 position:50% align:center
I have way more fun

00:23:35.582 --> 00:23:38.335 position:50% align:center
when I can be with
you and Diablo! Right?

00:23:38.418 --> 00:23:40.545 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Agreed. I was
just hoping I had time

00:23:40.628 --> 00:23:42.756 position:50% align:center
to conduct some
magic experiments.

00:23:42.839 --> 00:23:44.591 position:50% align:center
Heh. But screw that!

00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:46.760 position:50% align:center
Let's accept a new quest!

00:23:46.843 --> 00:23:47.927 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:23:48.011 --> 00:23:49.554 position:50% align:center
I'm ready when you are!

00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:52.515 position:50% align:center
If that is what
you desire, Master.

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:56.019 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Then let's go!
Stay close and don't wonder off!

00:23:56.102 --> 00:23:57.228 position:50% align:center
