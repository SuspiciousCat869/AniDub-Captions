[LUMACHINA panting]

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:17.726 position:50% align:center
--[TRIA] Hurry it up!
--[LUMACHINA] I'm trying!

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.395 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.028 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:29.779 position:50% align:center
[TRIA]
We're being ambushed!

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:37.537 position:50% align:center
Get back!

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.915 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Tria--!

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.250 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA screams]

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:43.835 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Tria!

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:52.344 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT laughs]

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.264 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT]
Oh poo.

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:58.516 position:50% align:center
No, that can't be the end.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
I was enjoying our little game.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.562 position:50% align:center
Weren't you, Lumachina?

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:05.357 position:50% align:center
Please, leave me alone.

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:08.610 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
God, hear my prayer.

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:10.945 position:50% align:center
Someone here cannot
hear your voice.

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:12.864 position:50% align:center
Make your powers known

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:15.450 position:50% align:center
and lead us out of the dark
with your guiding light.

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.787 position:50% align:center
Aw. How's that plan
working out for you?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.832 position:50% align:center
You think your angels
can handle all this? [laughs]

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.460 position:50% align:center
If they can grow flowers
in empty fields,

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:27.754 position:50% align:center
and fill the rivers
with schools of fish.

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:30.090 position:50% align:center
Wow, your skin is flawless.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:32.050 position:50% align:center
I'm so jealous!

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:39.766 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Huh?

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:44.145 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT] Hello, Beast Mushroom!
You're just in time!

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.814 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA gasps]

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.028 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT cackling]

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.239 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT] Don't you hate it
when you try to set an example

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:56.991 position:50% align:center
of pious purity and then
someone sends along

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:58.618 position:50% align:center
a Summon to shatter your dreams?

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:00.537 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.748 position:50% align:center
Oh, they went there!

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:07.711 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Please stop. Please.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.754 position:50% align:center
Can we discuss this?

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.757 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA gasps]

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:15.927 position:50% align:center
I hate it here!

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:17.512 position:50% align:center
Why'd they stop?

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.406 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Um, God?

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:12.293 position:50% align:center
[SHERA sighs]
This weather is everything!

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
[REM]
I was gonna say that.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.630 position:50% align:center
Which means I had
the same thought as you,

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:18.341 position:50% align:center
and now I'm drowning
in self-hate.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:19.592 position:50% align:center
No you're not!

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center
But if you are,
sunbathing naked will help!

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
Uh, no. Not even a little bit.

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.142 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
You'll get an all-over tan!

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.852 position:50% align:center
You don't always have to strip!

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
Elves are such pervs!

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:30.895 position:50% align:center
Not true!

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.731 position:50% align:center
No one sunbathes
with their clothes on!

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:33.773 position:50% align:center
It doesn't work!

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
Okay, fine.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.736 position:50% align:center
So pick an activity that
doesn't require random nudity!

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.696 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] It's not random
if you're sunbathing!

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
Quit being such a pooper pants!

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:42.782 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Get drunk on that validation.

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:45.410 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Just another day
in virtual paradise.

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
It's been some time
since Rem and Shera

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:48.997 position:50% align:center
summoned me into this game.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.498 position:50% align:center
<i>Cross Reverie.</i>

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed to
talk to girls?

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.795 position:50% align:center
Right, I'll just act like
I'm role-playing

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.173 position:50% align:center
as Demon Lord Diablo!

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:01.843 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] And I've been
the Demon Lord ever since.

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I got to fight
Shera's freak brother

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center
and the Greenwood Kingdom
when they came for her.

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.477 position:50% align:center
And then crushed the
Fallen like a champ.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.188 position:50% align:center
I also released Krebskulm
from inside Rem's stomach

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50% align:center
and, you know,
made her my slave.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:16.733 position:50% align:center
That was cool.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.487 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I've done more
than I ever imagined.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.865 position:50% align:center
Overall, I'd say life as the
Demon Lord Diablo is all right.

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:24.908 position:50% align:center
I don't hate it.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.744 position:50% align:center
Tell her! I'm right!
Rem's wrong!

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.788 position:50% align:center
You can't sunbathe
with your clothes on!

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:32.040 position:50% align:center
It defeats the entire purpose!

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:33.583 position:50% align:center
Say it, Diablo!

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:34.709 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Arm assault!

00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:37.379 position:50% align:center
Assault with two
deadly flesh pillows!

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.297 position:50% align:center
[REM] It's really
not about sunbathing.

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:40.590 position:50% align:center
She needs to learn
you don't have to

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:43.385 position:50% align:center
take your clothes off
to have a good time.

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
And now I'm being stabbed

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:48.139 position:50% align:center
with the tiniest, angriest nubs!

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.433 position:50% align:center
[REM, SHERA gasp]

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:54.229 position:50% align:center
We did not come here
to relax or sunbathe!

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:56.856 position:50% align:center
We came here to
test out a new spell.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.400 position:50% align:center
So please focus!

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:01.277 position:50% align:center
Wait, a new what now?

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.822 position:50% align:center
It's called flight magic.

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center
[REM, SHERA]
You're just now telling us?

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
I'll try it on this log first
then attempt to ride it.

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:11.579 position:50% align:center
Stand back and watch.

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:13.373 position:50% align:center
You will do as I command.

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
I command you to fly!

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:19.462 position:50% align:center
Adzet!

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] You did it, Diablo!
You made the big log float!

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:31.266 position:50% align:center
Yay! Yay!

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
You're gonna give
yourself a black eye.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.396 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] This is nothing
to get excited about.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.608 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
After all, I am Diablo,

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:43.695 position:50% align:center
the Demon Lord
from another world!

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.447 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Thank goodness it worked!

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.949 position:50% align:center
Now, let's take it for a spin.

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:51.119 position:50% align:center
Wait! Where are you going?

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:53.038 position:50% align:center
Hey! Not too bad!

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:54.497 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Spoke too soon!

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.458 position:50% align:center
It's still a little bit wobbly!

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:57.625 position:50% align:center
In the game,
there was equipment

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:00.128 position:50% align:center
that let you fly
through the sky, too.

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:04.299 position:50% align:center
Let's see. There should be
some in that dungeon I created.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:06.551 position:50% align:center
What's that? Someone's magic?

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.057 position:50% align:center
Wow! It's so pretty!
I wonder what it could be!

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.268 position:50% align:center
[REM]
It's a light.

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:20.648 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Amazing. I've never
sensed power like this.

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.402 position:50% align:center
Is it wearing off already?
That was quick!

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:36.664 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
I think I lived.

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
Ouch. That's gonna leave a mark.

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:45.674 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
God?

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:48.635 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
No! Where did that come from?

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:52.180 position:50% align:center
And why can't anyone leave their
clothes on when the sun's out?

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:55.350 position:50% align:center
Wow, you're taller and younger.

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:58.603 position:50% align:center
What now?

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:02.148 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT] Look what you've done
to my precious Beast Mushroom!

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:03.400 position:50% align:center
Who do you think you are--

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.568 position:50% align:center
falling from the sky
unannounced?

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:07.112 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Is that a Paladin?

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center
Have you no respect
for a man's mushroom?

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:11.116 position:50% align:center
That was the only one I had.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:14.244 position:50% align:center
And now it's gone!
You scoundrel!

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.371 position:50% align:center
I don't give a damn
about your mushroom!

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:17.580 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea who--

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.416 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
My savior!

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.792 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO gasps]

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.878 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] Oh... You appeared
in my moment of need

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.630 position:50% align:center
like I knew you would.

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:28.133 position:50% align:center
I've only ever heard
your voice, and have always

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:31.052 position:50% align:center
felt lonely never
being able to see you!

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:33.388 position:50% align:center
I'm Lumachina Weselia.

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:36.516 position:50% align:center
And I've been praying
to you my entire life.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:37.517 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
She's just standing there

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.186 position:50% align:center
with her honkers hanging out!

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.438 position:50% align:center
Where're your clothes?

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.314 position:50% align:center
I can't take you
seriously like that.

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA gasps]

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.615 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA shrieks]

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] How could I present
myself so shamefully

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.998 position:50% align:center
in front of God Himself?

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:00.832 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Just. Here.

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.417 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA gasps]

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:05.420 position:50% align:center
I hardly know what to say.

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:08.048 position:50% align:center
I never imagined we'd
be swapping clothing.

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:11.134 position:50% align:center
Thank you.
It's truly a blessing.

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Well, this is awkward.

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center
Do I have a cape "thing"?

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.681 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA giggles]
So hot!

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:19.392 position:50% align:center
Wait, why is she
referring to me as God?

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:21.478 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT]
You weren't clothed by God!

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:22.854 position:50% align:center
You're covered in filth!

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.564 position:50% align:center
That's an idiot dirty demon!

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.816 position:50% align:center
No, not exactly. You see...

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.651 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
I know that he's God!

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center
He heard me pray to him!

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:31.446 position:50% align:center
That's why he's here!

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.198 position:50% align:center
He heard me from Heaven!

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.241 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA sighs]
It's inevitable.

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:37.202 position:50% align:center
If I'm speaking to--
or around--a female,

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
I will be interrupted
and then ignored.

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:43.458 position:50% align:center
Prayers? What kind?

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:48.171 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
She's got powers, too? Overkill.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
Please be very careful, my Lord.

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:55.345 position:50% align:center
This man is a sinner unworthy
of being your follower.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
But his powers
are well respected.

00:09:57.681 --> 00:09:59.808 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Okay, slow down,
I'm not a god of any sor--

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:00.934 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Don't say that about yourself!

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
It's true!

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:02.936 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
You're God!

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:04.688 position:50% align:center
No he is not!
You know what, forget it!

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.648 position:50% align:center
I'll just kill both
of you together!

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] It sounds like
Lumachina has developed

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.277 position:50% align:center
a strong faith in her religion.

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.196 position:50% align:center
So why would an
agent of the Church

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.573 position:50% align:center
be so interested in
taking away her life?

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.200 position:50% align:center
Oh. That's cute.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.493 position:50% align:center
You assume because
I work for them

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.662 position:50% align:center
I know what
the Church is thinking?

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:24.624 position:50% align:center
The reason I want her killed is
because Vishos told me to do so!

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:26.167 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:28.670 position:50% align:center
I get it now.
You're a mercenary.

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:30.380 position:50% align:center
It's all starting to make sense.

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.173 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT]
What did you call me?

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:35.677 position:50% align:center
Those mercenaries wish they were
worth as much as my toe hair!

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.139 position:50% align:center
That's it. How 'bout a shot of
Hunger Worm for the road!

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT'S WORM 1A roars]

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:48.023 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Mmkay.
A Level Sixty Hunter Worm.

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:50.442 position:50% align:center
I guess that's to be
expected from a Paladin.

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:51.609 position:50% align:center
It's on quite a different level

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:54.237 position:50% align:center
than the adventurers
in Faltra City.

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:59.367 position:50% align:center
However! You're
no match for me!

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:04.330 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:06.624 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Is that a
Level Eighty Trap Worm?

00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:09.085 position:50% align:center
Now that's what
I'm talkin' about!

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:13.048 position:50% align:center
A challenge! Gotcha.

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:22.182 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Rip them apart! Aero Shredder!

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:35.737 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT coughs]
I hate Elemental Magic so much!

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.031 position:50% align:center
Is that a high-level wind spell?

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:40.450 position:50% align:center
Your Summons are impressive

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:42.619 position:50% align:center
even though you're
a total scumbag.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.120 position:50% align:center
And you seem to know
a good deal about

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:47.290 position:50% align:center
Elemental Magic
from what I could see.

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:50.752 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised you didn't
write it off as being too weak.

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.714 position:50% align:center
[gasps] It's much different
when mastered.

00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
Elemental Magic
performs the best

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
when the power is condensed
into a single blow.

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
Ah, you've done
your homework I see.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.057 position:50% align:center
So tell me, Demon.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
How many times can you
fire your ultimate spell?

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:08.395 position:50% align:center
I wanna see!

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:11.815 position:50% align:center
Oh. I don't know that I have
an exact number for you.

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
But I'd say about a hundred
Aero Shredders is a good guess.

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.821 position:50% align:center
Don't you lie to me, Demon!

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:25.245 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Heh. Don't measure me
by your standards.

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:29.249 position:50% align:center
Paladin. You pathetic novice!

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:31.668 position:50% align:center
Cross Blizzard!

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:40.760 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA screams]

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:48.435 position:50% align:center
What-- What are you?

00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.237 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA gasps]

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.238 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Oh cripes!

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.531 position:50% align:center
Why did I use a freezing spell

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.159 position:50% align:center
when this girl's in
a cape and skivvies!

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
Dear God. I just...

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO gasps]
Hey. Are you okay?

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:13.585 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I am now.

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:15.754 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much for saving me.

00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:17.130 position:50% align:center
Let me be clear.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:18.548 position:50% align:center
I am nobody's god.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.925 position:50% align:center
You couldn't be
more wrong about--

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.720 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Wha-- Wa-Wake up!

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:27.223 position:50% align:center
[REM]
There you are!

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:30.018 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Diablo!

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:32.479 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:33.688 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:40.487 position:50% align:center
No! It's not.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.365 position:50% align:center
Guess it's out with the old
and in with the new.

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
Please. That's not what this is.

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
Are you sure about that?

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:49.204 position:50% align:center
I'm not.

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:52.332 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Why are they
ganging up on me like this?

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:56.044 position:50% align:center
That's enough. We need to
get back to the city!

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:58.505 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Um, you wanna slow down?

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:10.850 position:50% align:center
[REM]
See? You lived.

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:13.186 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you
thawed out, Lumachina.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Me, too. Thanks for your help.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.733 position:50% align:center
If it's not too much, could I
ask you two a question?

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:21.695 position:50% align:center
What exactly is your
relationship with the savior?

00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:26.241 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I zoned out--
did you call Diablo a savior?

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:28.827 position:50% align:center
Let's see. I guess if
we were to name it,

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.995 position:50% align:center
he'd be our owner.

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:32.914 position:50% align:center
Do you mean those
are slave collars?

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:35.458 position:50% align:center
But why? Why would
our God have slaves?

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50% align:center
It's not like that!
We put the collars on ourselves!

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
You did?

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:42.007 position:50% align:center
Sorta. It's like an exchange.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.675 position:50% align:center
When you summon a Demon Lord,

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:45.802 position:50% align:center
you take on his magic reflec--

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:48.555 position:50% align:center
What she means is that
Diablo is the leader

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:49.973 position:50% align:center
of our adventuring party.

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:51.266 position:50% align:center
Adventuring?

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:54.394 position:50% align:center
You can't be talking about
my God who saved me?

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:56.980 position:50% align:center
I need him to be God
and that's it.

00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:58.982 position:50% align:center
Why do you "need" that?

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
Well, because...

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:06.114 position:50% align:center
He saw me in my
birthday dress. Naked.

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:07.365 position:50% align:center
--[SHERA gasps]
--Yeah, and?

00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's okay!

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:10.952 position:50% align:center
We saw you naked, too!

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:16.666 position:50% align:center
[SHERA shrieks]
What'd I do to you?

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.293 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
The thing is...

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:19.627 position:50% align:center
It's different for me.

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:21.755 position:50% align:center
Only my husband
can see my flesh.

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
[REM, SHERA]
Huh?

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:26.718 position:50% align:center
Which means, if this Diablo
isn't God or anyone holy,

00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:29.846 position:50% align:center
the only way to make it
right is to marry me.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.101 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Listen, Klem.

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:37.562 position:50% align:center
Just stay here until
we know who she is.

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center
Think you can do that?

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.273 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:42.859 position:50% align:center
Just keep those yummy
cookies coming my way!

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:45.320 position:50% align:center
[EDELGARD] I'll stay up here
with the lady Demon Lord.

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:47.781 position:50% align:center
She might need me. Or not.

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
Good.

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.784 position:50% align:center
[REM, SHERA scream]

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
What the hell was that?

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.996 position:50% align:center
[REM hisses] Don't you dare
get an attitude with us,

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.790 position:50% align:center
little miss
naked-in-a-cape girl!

00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:59.167 position:50% align:center
You need to respect the
pecking order in place,

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.545 position:50% align:center
and I'm number one!
So get in line!

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:05.465 position:50% align:center
Wait. What are you
talking about?

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:07.884 position:50% align:center
What's all the
commotion in here?

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.803 position:50% align:center
Oh, hello again.

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:12.055 position:50% align:center
Please reassure me
that you're really God.

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:13.723 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Hm?

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:15.517 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I can't just
tell the sweet church girl

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.727 position:50% align:center
she's been hanging out
with a Demon Lord.

00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.145 position:50% align:center
And at the same time,

00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:21.523 position:50% align:center
I can't have her
believing I'm God.

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:26.820 position:50% align:center
Please understand,
I can't reveal my true identity

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:28.488 position:50% align:center
for many godly reasons.

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:30.281 position:50% align:center
At least for now.

00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:32.909 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
I understand.

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:40.625 position:50% align:center
Then for now, may I please
call you Sir Diablo?

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:42.585 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I mean, yeah,
that would be pretty sweet.

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:45.588 position:50% align:center
Lumachina, tell me who you are.

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:49.592 position:50% align:center
You're different. You're not
like the Demon Lord worshipers.

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:52.137 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
I'm a simple human.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.472 position:50% align:center
One who has devoted
her life to serving God.

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:56.307 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:16:58.184 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
But in the Church,

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:03.565 position:50% align:center
I am known to all
as the Head Priest.

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:05.108 position:50% align:center
Cool. Can I go now?

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:09.279 position:50% align:center
Wait. As in the most important
person in the whole Church?

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:10.822 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
I'm gonna puke.

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:14.576 position:50% align:center
But now I see why she believed
some angel appeared before her.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.996 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Lumachina. Dear.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.206 position:50% align:center
Why would the highest-ranking
member of the Church

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.459 position:50% align:center
end up being targeted
by a Paladin?

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:23.752 position:50% align:center
It's complicated,

00:17:23.835 --> 00:17:26.046 position:50% align:center
but it has to do with
the Church's Cardinals.

00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:28.381 position:50% align:center
They're the ones who
actually run everything.

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:33.094 position:50% align:center
It's been revealed to me that
one of them wants me eliminated.

00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:35.889 position:50% align:center
And the worst part is that
many of the Paladins--

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
the church's military--
they follow Vishos.

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.353 position:50% align:center
He's the Head Cardinal.

00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:45.106 position:50% align:center
I see. But I still don't get why
they would want to kill you.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.649 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:50.278 position:50% align:center
Maybe because I questioned them
about illegal goods and money?

00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:53.114 position:50% align:center
Or maybe because I
ordered an investigation

00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:55.200 position:50% align:center
into how Paladins are acting?

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:56.659 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure.

00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:57.952 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
I get it now.

00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
She values her morals
more than her own life.

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
And because of that,
she almost died.

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:05.794 position:50% align:center
What an idiot. So stupid.

00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
And yet, I think I like her.

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:12.217 position:50% align:center
So where exactly were you
trying to go when we found you?

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.095 position:50% align:center
Well, you see, I planned to
pass through this city

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:18.264 position:50% align:center
on my way to the old
Demon Lord's domain.

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:21.142 position:50% align:center
I was hoping to find
the Head Paladin, Batutta,

00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
who was assigned to that area.

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:26.231 position:50% align:center
I wanted to discuss the
current state of the Church.

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:29.025 position:50% align:center
Batutta. I've heard of that guy.

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:31.027 position:50% align:center
He's a regular man with powers

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.655 position:50% align:center
who involved himself in
the Human-Fallen War.

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:35.782 position:50% align:center
Very noble.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.242 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's the one.

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:39.703 position:50% align:center
I believe he's
someone I can trust.

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:43.581 position:50% align:center
Once he learns what's happening,
I have faith he'll take action.

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
I trust that he'd be ready
to protect me as well.

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:52.048 position:50% align:center
Plus, she--the Paladin
Tria--she told me so.

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
People lie a lot,
you know. You trust her?

00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:58.555 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] She risked her
life to save mine.

00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.598 position:50% align:center
If she hadn't,
then I'd probably be--

00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
[REM]
I get it! It's cool!

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:05.270 position:50% align:center
So. What happens next?

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:07.355 position:50% align:center
I mean once they learn
the assassination failed,

00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:09.357 position:50% align:center
they'll be back to try again.

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:13.778 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] I understand
the risk I'd be taking.

00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:16.531 position:50% align:center
But I'm going to Zircon Tower
no matter what,

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
and I will meet with Batutta.

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:20.201 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Zircon Tower?

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:22.495 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure that's
where I built my dungeon.

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:23.872 position:50% align:center
That's quite a hike.

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:26.082 position:50% align:center
Just to meet with some guy.

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:27.584 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't go by yourself.

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.419 position:50% align:center
Rem and I love adventure!

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center
We could keep you company
and keep you safe!

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:33.923 position:50% align:center
[REM] There you go
volunteering us again.

00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:36.551 position:50% align:center
But, you're right.
We can't just leave her.

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:37.594 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:39.054 position:50% align:center
Should we risk
danger and fatigue

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
for this girl we hardly know?

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:43.600 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I can't wait!

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:46.770 position:50% align:center
Um. That would be
helpful but risky.

00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:49.105 position:50% align:center
Lucky for you,
we're adventurers.

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:50.482 position:50% align:center
--We love danger!
--Yeah we are!

00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:51.524 position:50% align:center
We're weird like that.

00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:52.817 position:50% align:center
I mean, you saw him, right?

00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
Diablo's strong enough
to keep us all safe!

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:57.781 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes.

00:19:57.864 --> 00:20:00.658 position:50% align:center
I did experience the
Lord's-- Uh, I mean...

00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:03.161 position:50% align:center
It would be silly to
worry with him there.

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.288 position:50% align:center
I trust him completely!

00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:07.123 position:50% align:center
[REM]
So what do you say?

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
Please? Just say yes!

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:12.754 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Lumachina's sense of
justice is really admirable.

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:15.090 position:50% align:center
I feel bad about
all she's going through.

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:17.759 position:50% align:center
But I would rather avoid
church crazies if I can.

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
The power they possess over
this nation makes me rage.

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:25.558 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Though. If it's just
escorting her to Zircon Tower,

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
then chances of those
sorts of run-ins are slim.

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:30.730 position:50% align:center
It's point A to point B
and then out. Right?

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.653 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO chuckles]
Is it strength you seek?

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:41.366 position:50% align:center
Then I, Diablo the Demon Lord,
shall lend you my power!

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:44.869 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Thank you so much!

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:47.414 position:50% align:center
Sir, you have
no idea what this--

00:20:47.497 --> 00:20:49.708 position:50% align:center
Guess who doesn't have
anymore cookies!

00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:53.336 position:50% align:center
If you guessed your favorite
Demon Lord, then you're right!

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.838 position:50% align:center
I need more cookies please.

00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:57.132 position:50% align:center
Um. Who is this girl?

00:20:57.215 --> 00:20:59.634 position:50% align:center
And what is this
dark magic energy?

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:02.804 position:50% align:center
It's seeping out of every
pore in their bodies.

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
What the? What's the matter
with this rude human?

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:08.685 position:50% align:center
She smells like one of them!

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:11.062 position:50% align:center
I don't like that smell.

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:13.732 position:50% align:center
Ew! She smells holy!

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Figures they'd be able to tell.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.195 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute. That's not good!

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:21.531 position:50% align:center
They're gonna fight
and bring me into it!

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:24.617 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:25.952 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:28.997 position:50% align:center
That's a no.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.540 position:50% align:center
Did you really think
it was a good idea

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:32.250 position:50% align:center
to fight in front of me?

00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:35.128 position:50% align:center
For what reason?
Because of her smell?

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:38.715 position:50% align:center
You'd rather stir up chaos
than take your nose elsewhere?

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:42.385 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA gasps]
I apologize, sir.

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:45.096 position:50% align:center
Fine! But she better
stay away from me!

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.183 position:50% align:center
She'll ruin the taste
of my cookies!

00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:49.267 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO sighs]

00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:51.644 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
This is not gonna work out.

00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:54.689 position:50% align:center
In the end, we decided to
leave the Demon Lord Klem

00:21:54.773 --> 00:21:57.567 position:50% align:center
and Eldelgard the
Fallen behind in Faltra.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.903 position:50% align:center
Of course, while we were away...

00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:01.946 position:50% align:center
Mew got it!

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.657 position:50% align:center
I promise you're leaving
them in the best paws!

00:22:04.741 --> 00:22:06.659 position:50% align:center
Rest assured! Meow!

00:22:06.743 --> 00:22:08.161 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] We decided to
leave them with Mei,

00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:10.997 position:50% align:center
the poster girl at the inn.

00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:13.208 position:50% align:center
[SYLVIE]
Yeah, okay. I think I got it.

00:22:13.291 --> 00:22:15.168 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Sorry I can't give more details.

00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:16.628 position:50% align:center
There's no need!

00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:20.423 position:50% align:center
You've done so much for us
already, Deeb-a-rooni! Oh--

00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:23.802 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] And with Sylvie,
the Guildmaster.

00:22:23.885 --> 00:22:27.514 position:50% align:center
Absolutely, my dear!
They'll be safe here with me!

00:22:27.597 --> 00:22:29.307 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
We also contacted Celestine,

00:22:29.391 --> 00:22:30.642 position:50% align:center
the head of the Mage's Guild.

00:22:30.725 --> 00:22:32.894 position:50% align:center
I live to protect the ladies!

00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:35.897 position:50% align:center
Nay! I'll die for their safety!

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.108 position:50% align:center
Or my name isn't Emile!

00:22:38.191 --> 00:22:39.693 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] That one
might have been a mistake,

00:22:39.776 --> 00:22:42.570 position:50% align:center
but it made him feel relevant.

00:22:42.654 --> 00:22:46.241 position:50% align:center
Then finally,
we departed from Faltra.

00:22:47.158 --> 00:22:50.954 position:50% align:center
Bye! We're heading out
on a job, okay?

00:22:51.996 --> 00:22:53.832 position:50% align:center
Believe me, I'll be fine!

00:22:53.915 --> 00:22:55.417 position:50% align:center
You be careful.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.918 position:50% align:center
You tend to space out
and wander,

00:22:57.002 --> 00:22:58.336 position:50% align:center
which is most concerning.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.465 position:50% align:center
I know! Why don't I
grant you a token of my power?

00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:04.384 position:50% align:center
Uh, wait, what?

00:23:05.385 --> 00:23:06.386 position:50% align:center
[KREBSKULM grunts]

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:10.682 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
No frikkin way?

00:23:10.765 --> 00:23:12.642 position:50% align:center
She turned Shera's
Rare-grade bow into

00:23:12.726 --> 00:23:16.855 position:50% align:center
a Double-Super Rare
ebony bow, just for kicks?

00:23:16.938 --> 00:23:18.189 position:50% align:center
[SHERA gasps]
Whoa!

00:23:18.273 --> 00:23:20.692 position:50% align:center
My bow looks like it's
ready to kill someone now!

00:23:20.775 --> 00:23:23.778 position:50% align:center
Yup. That's what weapons
are supposed to do.

00:23:23.862 --> 00:23:27.115 position:50% align:center
I mean. It kinda looks
like you cursed it.

00:23:27.198 --> 00:23:28.658 position:50% align:center
But I trust you.

00:23:28.742 --> 00:23:31.369 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] That's an underground
cheat if I ever saw one.

00:23:31.453 --> 00:23:33.204 position:50% align:center
Leave it to Demon Klem.

00:23:33.288 --> 00:23:35.040 position:50% align:center
You've got Demon Lord powers!

00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:37.208 position:50% align:center
Yay! Thanks to me!

00:23:39.044 --> 00:23:40.462 position:50% align:center
And now!

00:23:40.545 --> 00:23:44.883 position:50% align:center
Rem! Shera! Lumachina!

00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:48.678 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Our journey
to Zircon Tower begins!

00:23:48.762 --> 00:23:50.347 position:50% align:center
[REM, SHERA, LUMACHINA]
Yes!

00:24:03.276 --> 00:24:05.612 position:50% align:center
[HORN] Can I interest you
in raiding a new dungeon?

00:24:05.695 --> 00:24:07.489 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Arrow of void,
drive a stake into

00:24:07.572 --> 00:24:10.283 position:50% align:center
the boundary between Heaven
and Earth! Gravity Abyss!

00:24:10.367 --> 00:24:13.119 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] This one looks
hard and a bit hairy!
