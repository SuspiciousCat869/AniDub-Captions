Please rest assured.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.394 position:50% align:center
We will not place the Head
Priest in a confession chamber.

00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:21.187 position:50% align:center
We will continue to
honor her status

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:25.316 position:50% align:center
and only reserve such action
for the rest of her entourage.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.651 position:50% align:center
I do hope you will
find this room

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.028 position:50% align:center
comfortable enough to relax and

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.905 position:50% align:center
make yourself at home
until it's time.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.908 position:50% align:center
Time for your
execution, that is.

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:36.327 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Vishos.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:39.164 position:50% align:center
I pray that God
will have mercy on you.

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.167 position:50% align:center
Get her out of my sight at once!

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.336 position:50% align:center
[WHITEMASKS]
Yes, sir.

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:46.504 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS]
Absolutely absurd.

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
I will never beg
for God's forgiveness.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:52.927 position:50% align:center
Because even God will be
under my control soon.

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.721 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
I have to find a way to escape!

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:57.599 position:50% align:center
The pursuers will be
here soon, so I gotta hurry!

00:00:57.682 --> 00:01:01.644 position:50% align:center
At least the others will be all
right since Diablo's with them.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.772 position:50% align:center
They're gonna be just fine!

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.359 position:50% align:center
This cup. I brought it with me

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:09.819 position:50% align:center
as a souvenir from
the treasure vault.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.488 position:50% align:center
What an adventure!

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.616 position:50% align:center
It really was like
a dream come true.

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:17.452 position:50% align:center
I had the best time.

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:19.037 position:50% align:center
They... They're all...

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.873 position:50% align:center
They're all my friends!

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:24.709 position:50% align:center
Please let them be okay!

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:27.754 position:50% align:center
[BABALON]
You wanna save 'em, then?

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:30.924 position:50% align:center
Of course! More than anything!

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:32.759 position:50% align:center
Wait. Who... Who said that?

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:35.387 position:50% align:center
[BABALON]
I'm down here! Hello!

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.348 position:50% align:center
Dun-da-da-dun-dun-dun-duh!

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:39.808 position:50% align:center
Hi there!

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:16.488 position:50% align:center
[HORN gasps]
What in the hell are you?

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:20.575 position:50% align:center
[BABALON]
Rude! You really don't know?

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:22.452 position:50% align:center
I am none other than
the Level-Up Goddess

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:24.329 position:50% align:center
who dwells within
the Holy Grail,

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:27.082 position:50% align:center
the legendary
Babalon herself? Hello?

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:30.585 position:50% align:center
Huh? What the? Holy Grail?

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.171 position:50% align:center
--Yeah duh!
--Wow! Hold on.

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:35.715 position:50% align:center
What did you say about
being a level-up goddess?

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.300 position:50% align:center
Just that I am one!

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
And speaking of which.
You're a level 20, yeah?

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:44.224 position:50% align:center
Big "oof." At least
when it's that tragic.

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:46.851 position:50% align:center
It's pretty easy to throw a few
level-up bones your way

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.269 position:50% align:center
whether or not you
actually earned them.

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:50.188 position:50% align:center
What? Are you serious?

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:52.982 position:50% align:center
If you did, then I could
go rescue everyone!

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.901 position:50% align:center
Hurry up! Do it so
I can save them!

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:56.653 position:50% align:center
Um, yeah I don't know
how I feel about

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:59.239 position:50% align:center
you bossing me around like that.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:03.284 position:50% align:center
Okay I'm sorry! I take it back!

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:07.080 position:50% align:center
Please have mercy on me!

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Time out!
That's a little extreme.

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center
[HORN] It's nothing compared
to what they're feeling!

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:16.881 position:50% align:center
I've abandoned them
when they need me most!

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:18.049 position:50% align:center
It hurts so much!

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.217 position:50% align:center
I don't mean my head!

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.593 position:50% align:center
I mean my heart!

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
[BABALON] I get it! I still
have some empathy left!

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:24.889 position:50% align:center
Do you really mean that?

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:27.308 position:50% align:center
Sure. Besides, you already
made an offering

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.477 position:50% align:center
so I'm kind of
obligated at this point.

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.062 position:50% align:center
I don't remember an offering.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.940 position:50% align:center
[BABALON]
It will maintain my beauty.

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
I needed fresh blood from
a maiden and you delivered!

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.445 position:50% align:center
[HORN gasps]

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:41.823 position:50% align:center
[BABALON] I noticed yours
had a strange flavor.

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:45.535 position:50% align:center
I'm not complaining, though,
it was still warm and delicious!

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.204 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.956 position:50% align:center
These are all rare items.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.583 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Wow. Okay, yeah.

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.877 position:50% align:center
Hey. Question. Um.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.963 position:50% align:center
Can you tell me how to
find the restroom in here?

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:59.215 position:50% align:center
I can see you haven't
been doing this long.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50% align:center
That was the most foolish
question I've ever been asked.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:04.095 position:50% align:center
Please remember this is
the Demon Lord's Castle,

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:05.430 position:50% align:center
a temple of purity.

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:07.724 position:50% align:center
Such filth is not allowed.

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
This is the most
terrifying place!

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.854 position:50% align:center
What's the matter with you?

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:15.732 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Uh, it's nothing! Gotta go! BRB!

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:20.195 position:50% align:center
[HORN] This is the worst
day of my entire life!

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
Ew.

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:35.210 position:50% align:center
[HORN] Yes, it's all
coming back to me now.

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:37.712 position:50% align:center
Guess that's why
my pee disappeared.

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
So in exchange for that
cup of fresh blood you gave me,

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:42.217 position:50% align:center
I'll grant you a miracle.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.760 position:50% align:center
Easy as that.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:46.262 position:50% align:center
Wow! How nice of you!

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.847 position:50% align:center
[HORN] As long as
she believes it's blood,

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.599 position:50% align:center
I'm not here to
crush any dreams.

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:52.310 position:50% align:center
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba.

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:55.522 position:50% align:center

[HORN gasps]

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:05.281 position:50% align:center
Is that it? Did I level up?

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.700 position:50% align:center
It's that easy?

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:08.993 position:50% align:center
My bad! Guess it didn't work!

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:12.038 position:50% align:center
What the hell are you
talking about?

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:14.124 position:50% align:center
Is this some kind of scam?

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.875 position:50% align:center
[BABALON] Um, why are you
screaming at me?

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.419 position:50% align:center
It's not my fault
it didn't work.

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:19.629 position:50% align:center
I promise, this sucks
just as much for me!

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:22.007 position:50% align:center
Yeah right!

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.467 position:50% align:center
[HORN] Oh crap! Is it
because it wasn't blood?

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:27.345 position:50% align:center
But there is another
way we could do it.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:28.596 position:50% align:center
I'm listening.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.432 position:50% align:center
There's a strong presence
in the next room.

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:31.891 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure it's
a super Level-Up

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50% align:center
that we can easily use.

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
[gasps] If I put the treasure
Rose brought around my neck,

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:41.359 position:50% align:center
I can create a Master-Servant
Pact with Mister Diablo

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:43.611 position:50% align:center
and that's all it
takes to level up!

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:48.491 position:50% align:center
Found it! This ought to do it!

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50% align:center
[BABALON] It's true, that is
a super level-up item.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:55.457 position:50% align:center
However, it comes with some
pretty hardcore restrictions.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.750 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Hold on a minute.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.085 position:50% align:center
Doesn't the servant
who forges that pact die?

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.046 position:50% align:center
Like, when the master does?

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:11.348 position:50% align:center

Did you bring snacks?

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.152 position:50% align:center

I can break down that door

No thank you.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.493 position:50% align:center
Lumachina wouldn't
want us to do that.

I'm working on a day like this.

Well, it's whatever.

Lumachina should be with them.

fighting the power

That's not a problem.

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:39.851 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 9A] God, grant us
mercy and salvation.

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:41.728 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Testing. One, two!

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:44.189 position:50% align:center
I have a message for
all you foolish mortals!

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:47.525 position:50% align:center
I am the Demon Lord, Diablo!

00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:48.693 position:50% align:center
I understand that
all of you have

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:50.945 position:50% align:center
lost sight of the truth
in your faith.

00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center
You find yourselves
longing for ruin.

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:57.744 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I have
descended to serve you!

00:17:57.827 --> 00:17:58.828 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 9A]
What did he just say?

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:01.456 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 9B]
He's a Demon Lord?

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I hate this kind of
dramatic attention.

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:09.130 position:50% align:center
But it's not about me right now.
Right now, I am the Demon Lord!

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:11.883 position:50% align:center
Lightning Meteor!

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:16.137 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVERS gasp]

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:19.641 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
That didn't sound good.

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:21.476 position:50% align:center
I hope I didn't hit any of them.

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:24.604 position:50% align:center
Please. Let no innocent
citizens be harmed!

00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:27.107 position:50% align:center
Activating Lightning Strike!

00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:32.404 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS]
Hey, what's going on?

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:35.949 position:50% align:center
Now, if you wish to succeed in
defeating a Demon Lord,

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:37.075 position:50% align:center
the first thing you must do is

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:40.745 position:50% align:center
bring out the one
closest to God!

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:43.748 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Hopefully, this gets
Lumachina to come out.

00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:46.876 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] None of you
wish to come forth?

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.169 position:50% align:center
How unfortunate.

00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:49.587 position:50% align:center
Then I suppose
you don't mind being

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:52.549 position:50% align:center
destroyed by my magic?

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:53.591 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Where is she?

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
Please come out, Lumachina!

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:58.221 position:50% align:center
A Demon Lord.

00:18:58.304 --> 00:18:59.514 position:50% align:center
[WHITEMASK 9C]
God help us!

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
[WHITEMASK 9D]
Please, have mercy!

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:02.976 position:50% align:center
[WHITEMASK 9E]
Please save us from this evil!

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:04.686 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Please come out!

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:06.938 position:50% align:center
Then I suppose I'll
destroy you all!

00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
Along with this castle!

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.943 position:50% align:center
Stop. Please wait.

00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:13.862 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
It's about time!

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Hello, Head Priest!

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.699 position:50% align:center
So, you've decided
to show yourself!

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:19.826 position:50% align:center
Where, may I ask,
are your Cardinals?

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:23.788 position:50% align:center
Surely they haven't
run away from you already?

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:27.334 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO laughs] That's right,
believers, they're despicable!

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:28.376 position:50% align:center
These men you worship

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.338 position:50% align:center
abandon their allies
in time of need!

00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:33.965 position:50% align:center
You've lost sight
of your true faith!

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:37.344 position:50% align:center
You believe our actions
have provoked you?

00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:39.846 position:50% align:center
We've caused you to appear
as a Demon Lord?

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:41.014 position:50% align:center
That is what I'm saying.

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:41.931 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 9E]
Stay strong, Head Priest!

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:43.141 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 9C]
Please save us!

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:44.726 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 9F]
We need you!

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:48.313 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Awesome!
Now it's finally turning into

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:51.649 position:50% align:center
Head Priest versus Demon
Lord--exactly what we need!

00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
You fools who call
yourselves believers!

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:57.822 position:50% align:center
You have engaged in Cardinal
Vishos' questionable preaching.

00:19:57.906 --> 00:20:01.159 position:50% align:center
And you've strayed from the true
teachings of your faith.

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
You seized the Head Priest
and contributed to his treason!

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.623 position:50% align:center
Refusing to think
for yourselves.

00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:09.209 position:50% align:center
And allowing others to
make decisions for you.

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:11.503 position:50% align:center
These are the sins
you've committed!

00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
You've rejected your
faith in God and for that,

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:15.840 position:50% align:center
you will all be punished!

00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:20.637 position:50% align:center
At least you'll be
together. In death.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.805 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 9G]
What? No!

00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:23.098 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 9H]
Somebody tricked us!

00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER 9I]
This can't be real!

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:27.894 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Perfect! Now I just
need to lose against Lumachina.

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:29.229 position:50% align:center
Then the believers will realize

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:30.772 position:50% align:center
who's the true
head of the church!

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:33.191 position:50% align:center
It's going exactly as planned!

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:35.360 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Come on, Lumachina!

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:37.237 position:50% align:center
This is your chance! Do it!

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.989 position:50% align:center
Admonish me! Now!

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:41.825 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:45.495 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Uh-- Understand me?
What is this about?

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:48.957 position:50% align:center
Sir Diablo, who is both
God and Demon Lord, has spoken.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.626 position:50% align:center
He has come to pass
judgement on us at last.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.629 position:50% align:center
The time to atone
for our sins has arrived.

00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:56.006 position:50% align:center
He's here for us.

00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:58.133 position:50% align:center
We'll ascend with him to Heaven.

00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:00.969 position:50% align:center
But this is nothing
to grieve over.

00:21:01.052 --> 00:21:04.889 position:50% align:center
For all of our souls will be
cleansed and purified.

00:21:04.973 --> 00:21:07.183 position:50% align:center
Let us be grateful
for our new life,

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:09.269 position:50% align:center
our brand-new beginning,

00:21:09.352 --> 00:21:12.272 position:50% align:center
and for the gift of
passing on together.

00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:15.775 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Wait, what? Passing on together?

00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:18.278 position:50% align:center
No, no, no, no!
That's completely wrong!

00:21:18.361 --> 00:21:20.822 position:50% align:center
We have faith in you,
Head Priest!

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:22.323 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Just frikkin great!

00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:25.035 position:50% align:center
So now I have to slaughter
a town of innocent believers?

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:27.996 position:50% align:center
Pretending to be a Demon Lord
has led me to incite a massacre?

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:30.331 position:50% align:center
What kind of sick joke is that?

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:35.503 position:50% align:center
[VISHOS] If we eliminate
the Head Priest

00:21:35.587 --> 00:21:38.340 position:50% align:center
as well as that Demon Lord,
we should be secure!

00:21:38.423 --> 00:21:39.924 position:50% align:center
We'll be able to
win over the believers

00:21:40.008 --> 00:21:42.635 position:50% align:center
and restore our position!

00:21:42.719 --> 00:21:45.305 position:50% align:center

But, Vishos, sir.

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:49.267 position:50% align:center

Cast your judgment upon us.

00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:04.949 position:50% align:center
The time has come
for us to repent!

00:22:05.033 --> 00:22:06.576 position:50% align:center

What do I do?
