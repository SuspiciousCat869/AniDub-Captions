Reporting! Ship number 13!

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.787 position:50% align:center
She's been taken down
by the enemy!

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.665 position:50% align:center
Got a sail down! It's ship 22!

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:44.210 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS] How'd the Fallen
get this strong?

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:45.920 position:50% align:center
Was it when they were granted
a Demon Lord's power?

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:47.505 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS]
Fanis?

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.473 position:50% align:center
Hello, Varakness.

00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:00.185 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS] That is
my new darling, isn't it?

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:02.395 position:50% align:center
Fanis Laminitus!

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.647 position:50% align:center
I've come to take
you away, my love.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.358 position:50% align:center
Just as I promised I would.

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:09.778 position:50% align:center
Tell me something, have you
found a wedding dress, yet?

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.204 position:50% align:center
You've got to be kidding!

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:45.123 position:50% align:center
Bringing your hussies
to the battlefield?

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:46.708 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS]
What a horrible way to describe

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.877 position:50% align:center
my beloved wives
and co-commanders

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.254 position:50% align:center
of the Demon Lord's Army.

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:53.673 position:50% align:center
What's more,
after you've joined my harem,

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:55.133 position:50% align:center
let's not forget.

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:57.719 position:50% align:center
These lovely charmers
will be your sister brides.

00:02:57.802 --> 00:02:59.554 position:50% align:center
You must be
completely demented!

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:01.723 position:50% align:center
Thinking I'd actually
marry a Fallen?

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.266 position:50% align:center
Don't make me laugh!

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.186 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS] I've prepared a
dazzling wedding ring for you.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.729 position:50% align:center
Don't you want to put it on?

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:09.064 position:50% align:center
I'm ready to feel your love

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:12.067 position:50% align:center

over these women.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.276 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS]
Idiot.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.070 position:50% align:center
You know, I've prepared
a gift for you, too.

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:17.072 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll enjoy it.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:22.118 position:50% align:center
Oh! My sweet Fanis!
You've got me so excited!

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS]
We'll see how excited you are

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:25.622 position:50% align:center
when I snuff out that arrogance!

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.208 position:50% align:center
Lightning Shot! Activate!

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:38.301 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS]
Now that's just wonderful!

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:41.763 position:50% align:center
Punk.

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:44.432 position:50% align:center
Whoa! She got the enemy!

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
Perfect shot.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.476 position:50% align:center
She got the enemy commander!

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.019 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 6F]
Turns out we have a lady king!

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 6G]
Yeah we do!

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS]
King! King! King! King!

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:55.193 position:50% align:center
Inform the rest that
the enemy's commander's dead!

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
Then prepare--

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.375 position:50% align:center
What? No way.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.755 position:50% align:center
Did I just ruin your
big moment? I'm sorry.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.257 position:50% align:center
I must say, I'm impressed.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50% align:center
I don't believe I've suffered
wounds like those before.

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.178 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS]
This is impossible!

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.973 position:50% align:center
I know that blast went
right through his heart!

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:27.058 position:50% align:center
Anyway, let's move on, shall we?

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:29.978 position:50% align:center
I brought a lovely gift
I hope you'll enjoy!

What magic is this?

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:53.084 position:50% align:center
Stand strong, men!

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
All units must maintain--

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50% align:center
What? How'd that happen?

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Would you like me
to give you a hint?

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:10.477 position:50% align:center
Varakness sent me to
retrieve you as a sister bride.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.395 position:50% align:center
However, I can't stand
women who are

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.689 position:50% align:center
more generously endowed than me.

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:18.526 position:50% align:center
And I have no desire to
add you to our harem.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.404 position:50% align:center
I'd much rather kill you!

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center

So much chaos.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.344 position:50% align:center
Can this even be
called a battle?

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:48.014 position:50% align:center
This is not a fair fight.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:52.352 position:50% align:center
[CROW] That's very true.
It's more of a show.

I am a true Demon Lord

The name's Diablo!

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] A city of the mortal
races means nothing to me.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.996 position:50% align:center
What I won't tolerate
is claiming to be

Sounds like you'll be
needing backup!

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.719 position:50% align:center
Yeah! It's important to
lean on your friends

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50% align:center

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.724 position:50% align:center
Yes. I'll be right beside you

Teleportation!

It allows you to return to
any place you've visited.

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:27.238 position:50% align:center
Best part is that you
arrive within an instant.

Master, unfortunately,
I've never left the dungeon.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.537 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I can't go with you.

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:38.083 position:50% align:center
But um. I'll be here
waiting for you to return,

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:40.919 position:50% align:center

that day until then.

Nonsense. You're
coming, too, Rose!

kill you immediately.

you brainless Fallen

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:22.664 position:50% align:center
Oops! I said I wasn't
going to kill them instantly

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:24.708 position:50% align:center
and it appears I've
done just that!

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
Oh well. I suppose I should
clean up this mess.

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:31.756 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] Dear God, please
grant this man your mercy.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.635 position:50% align:center
Heal his wounds. Preserve him.

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
Please heal this man.

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
Please save his life.

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:42.267 position:50% align:center
Who's next?

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.560 position:50% align:center
I'm ready for them, Horn.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Yeah, copy that!

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.938 position:50% align:center
But maybe you should take
some time to rest, first?

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:48.481 position:50% align:center
I'm okay, Horn.

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:51.026 position:50% align:center
I've got Diablo on my side.

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:54.529 position:50% align:center
No. I mean I've got
God on my side.

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO chuckles]
Tornado Impact!

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:03.538 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO cackles]

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:06.916 position:50% align:center
Wow. Intriguing sorcerer.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.045 position:50% align:center
Now he looks like
one worth killing.

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:17.677 position:50% align:center
Don't let those monsters
into the city!

00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:19.596 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
So you're alive, then?

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:22.724 position:50% align:center
Good to see you,
Lord of Zircon Tow--

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:25.560 position:50% align:center
Diablo. You frightened me.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.480 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
She says, holding a weapon

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:29.981 position:50% align:center
she was just
pointing at my junk!

00:11:30.065 --> 00:11:31.775 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful to your friends.

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:33.777 position:50% align:center
They've already been a big help.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
I had personal interest.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
It wasn't a favor.

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:38.573 position:50% align:center
No one can call themselves
the Demon Lord's Army

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:40.450 position:50% align:center
without my permission.

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50% align:center
Heh. Now I understand.

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:45.205 position:50% align:center
Problem is, unless
Varakness is defeated,

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:47.165 position:50% align:center
there's no way we'll win.

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:49.167 position:50% align:center
Who is Varakness?

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.251 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS]
He's new.

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.045 position:50% align:center
The army's commander-in-chief.

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:54.673 position:50% align:center
He has powers granted
by a Demon Lord.

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:57.425 position:50% align:center
His own might is
indeed impressive.

00:11:57.509 --> 00:12:01.221 position:50% align:center
But he also commands a powerful
sorcerer and a skilled healer.

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:04.099 position:50% align:center
Plus a Fallen that can appear
out of people's shadows.

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
This makes getting
close to him very difficult.

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:09.437 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] It makes no difference
what kind of foe he is.

00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:11.856 position:50% align:center
Once I hit him
with my Grand Magic--

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:17.529 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
What? He's kissing her?

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:20.240 position:50% align:center
Ew. She's kissing him back?

00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:22.492 position:50% align:center
Oh come on? Really?

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
How is that real life?
I guess it's not.

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:27.706 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:31.876 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Those rings!
Frikkin wedding bands?

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.338 position:50% align:center
No way. So that means...

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:40.093 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] This is some
kind of twisted harem?

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
Because the perfect place
for a creepy handsy-man

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:44.264 position:50% align:center
is on a battlefield.

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:49.144 position:50% align:center
[cackling]

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:52.480 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS]
Uh, what's up? What's so funny?

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:59.946 position:50% align:center
I'll be back very soon.
After I murder them!

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.240 position:50% align:center
Hold on! Diablo?

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:05.660 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS]
Oh my godless-ness!

00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:07.037 position:50% align:center
Are you really cocky enough

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.748 position:50% align:center
to challenge me
to a battle head on?

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:16.254 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.179 position:50% align:center
Varakne--

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
Impossible!
You'll regret that, sir.

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:30.685 position:50% align:center
I wasn't too impressed.

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:32.187 position:50% align:center
The screaming was silly.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
Do you have anything
less obnoxious?

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center
Don't you move.
This ought to be fun.

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:40.695 position:50% align:center
What nerve you have to
kill my sweet little sister!

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:43.907 position:50% align:center
So many ways I could
slice you up--

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.325 position:50% align:center
Ow! Let go of me!

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:48.244 position:50% align:center
Begone to a world where
all life and time are frozen.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.705 position:50% align:center
Absolute Zero!

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:56.044 position:50% align:center
[CROW] It's so cold!
My body. I'm freezing!

00:13:56.127 --> 00:14:00.090 position:50% align:center
Please! No! I don't want to die!

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:02.050 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Whoops. Too late.

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:06.429 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
So. Who's next?

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:09.516 position:50% align:center
How? Who in the world
is this bizarre mortal?

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:10.684 position:50% align:center
[sings]

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:12.811 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS]
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:13.895 position:50% align:center
It's not you.

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:16.356 position:50% align:center
This man has Magic
Reflection powers.

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:19.025 position:50% align:center
He can push anything
you do back at us.

00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:21.486 position:50% align:center
Oooh! Look who's
paying attention!

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.113 position:50% align:center
Wish I had caught on earlier.

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:26.574 position:50% align:center
I never imagined you'd be able
to defeat two of my wives.

00:14:26.658 --> 00:14:29.077 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] And yet you seem
quite complacent about it all.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.328 position:50% align:center
I guess that means
you won't mind

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:32.080 position:50% align:center
when I take out the third!

00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:33.957 position:50% align:center
Flare Burst!

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:43.550 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS screams]

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:45.593 position:50% align:center
Wh-What power is that?

00:14:45.677 --> 00:14:50.515 position:50% align:center
[VARKENESS HAREM GIRL 6B sings]

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:52.183 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS gasps]

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:54.144 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:03.611 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS] Why? Why would you
choose to harm my darlings?

00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:05.196 position:50% align:center
You murderer!

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.740 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] You're asking
why I killed an enemy

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center
on a battlefield and
calling me a "murderer"

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.161 position:50% align:center
as though you don't
understand why we're here?

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:12.746 position:50% align:center
Besides that,

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:15.165 position:50% align:center
everyone knows you target the
healer first, it's common sense.

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:16.666 position:50% align:center
How dare you!

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:20.045 position:50% align:center
I don't need them to rip
you apart. I'll do it myself!

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:24.215 position:50% align:center
Oh? In other words,
you provide entertainment, too!

00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:25.967 position:50% align:center
I'll kill you!

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:28.511 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS yelling]

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
Are you serious? Is this it?

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:33.099 position:50% align:center
What? How are you
evading me, mortal?

00:15:33.183 --> 00:15:35.769 position:50% align:center
I was given my powers
by a Demon Lord!

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:37.187 position:50% align:center
I'm on a very high level!

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.481 position:50% align:center
At least 160!

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:43.193 position:50% align:center
I think it's your equipment.

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:46.279 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure which Demon Lord
granted you this power,

00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:49.449 position:50% align:center
but raising your level to
the cap is pretty standard.

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:52.077 position:50% align:center
When finished, it's the
equipment that you use

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.204 position:50% align:center
that determines superiority.

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:57.082 position:50% align:center
But that equipment could be
useless if you lack skill,

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:59.751 position:50% align:center
reaction speed,
and situational awareness.

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:01.878 position:50% align:center
Please. I don't believe you.

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:03.588 position:50% align:center
How is it not common knowledge?

00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:06.424 position:50% align:center
I suppose because I'm a Demon
Lord from another world.

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:10.387 position:50% align:center
But those rules are why
I won't lose to a mere Fallen!

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.596 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS]
You're all talk.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.764 position:50% align:center
I just need to hit you.

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:14.766 position:50% align:center
Be brave and let me punch you!

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:17.644 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna end you with one blow!

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:20.146 position:50% align:center
Futile. Your attacks
won't reach me

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.233 position:50% align:center
thanks to the effect of
the Mystic Gem of Illusion.

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:24.317 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:28.863 position:50% align:center
I think it's time
we end this, don't you?

00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:32.450 position:50% align:center
O White, with your
purifying heat and light,

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:34.994 position:50% align:center
return everything to white!

00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:37.038 position:50% align:center

[screaming]

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:04.649 position:50% align:center
No. What's happening?

00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:06.484 position:50% align:center
Why's everything fading away?

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:09.362 position:50% align:center
Wow, look I'm just impressed
you're breathing.

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:12.115 position:50% align:center
Just wait. I'll never
forgive you for this!

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
You're gonna pay!

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:18.329 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS chuckles]
I've got you now!

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:22.250 position:50% align:center
Activate. Energy Drain!

00:17:22.334 --> 00:17:24.002 position:50% align:center

A blood sucking spell?

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:25.670 position:50% align:center
That's your hidden ace?

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
How trite and disappointing.

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:28.465 position:50% align:center
Nice try, though!

[groans]

00:17:30.842 --> 00:17:33.053 position:50% align:center
Fine. You've proven
you're stronger.

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:37.015 position:50% align:center
But I still have
the Demon Lord on my side!

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:39.392 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Right, and I shall
pulverize whichever

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:42.020 position:50% align:center
Demon Lord tries to revive you.

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
Because I am
the true Demon Lord!

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.399 position:50% align:center
And my name's Diablo!

Diablo, sir!

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:31.277 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS] To Diablo,
for providing the greatest

00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:33.113 position:50% align:center
service in this battle.

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:36.783 position:50% align:center
Your efforts to save our city
won't be forgotten.

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:38.284 position:50% align:center
I already told you.

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:41.413 position:50% align:center
I didn't come here to save
a city or protect mortal races.

00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:44.207 position:50% align:center
I came here to display
the powers of a Demon Lord

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.667 position:50% align:center
and destroy the imposters.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS]
Heh. That's right, you did.

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:49.295 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Such delicious food!

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:51.089 position:50% align:center
Time to play everyone's
favorite game,

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
"How Disgusting Are Elves?"

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:55.176 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Water! Water!

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.845 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Every time.

00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:59.764 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Anyone seen Horn?

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she said was
going to the bathroom,

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:03.601 position:50% align:center
but she'd be right back.

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:06.396 position:50% align:center
Hope she's okay.
She looked down earlier.

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
She might be having
stomach issues in there.

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:15.488 position:50% align:center
[ADVENTURER 6A]
Hey there, Horn-ball!

00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:17.532 position:50% align:center
Ya know, I was shocked
to learn you're a girl,

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
but more shocked that you're
still training for battle!

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.369 position:50% align:center
That's pretty neat!

00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:23.788 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I bet they
gave you a huge reward!

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
Hand it over!

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:27.042 position:50% align:center
It's only fair
since we took you on

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:29.794 position:50% align:center
all of those adventures
before, right?

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:31.755 position:50% align:center
What's only fair?
I don't get it.

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.631 position:50% align:center
I didn't receive a reward!

00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:36.176 position:50% align:center
I must've left before
they were given out.

00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:38.595 position:50% align:center
Although, even if I
had received one,

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50% align:center
there's no way I'd ever
hand it over to you jerks!

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
What'd you say?

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you heard me!
I had fun with all of them.

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:49.022 position:50% align:center
They're way more fun than
you could ever hope to be!

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:50.982 position:50% align:center
And plus. I sucked.

00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:53.943 position:50% align:center
I did everything wrong,
but they still said thank you.

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:55.445 position:50% align:center
When you're saying "they,"

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:58.031 position:50% align:center
are you talking about
the head priest's groupies?

00:19:58.114 --> 00:19:59.366 position:50% align:center
It's like you think
it's an honor

00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:00.867 position:50% align:center
to run around with those creeps!

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.035 position:50% align:center
[ADVENTURER 6B]
They're not all gross.

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
There's that panther girl
and the elf girl

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.372 position:50% align:center
with the huge bongos.

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:06.748 position:50% align:center
They were smokin' hot.

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
Bet that damn Demon's
living it up with you three!

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.961 position:50% align:center
Although he spent
most of the battle hiding

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:14.339 position:50% align:center
and quivering in the shadows!

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:16.675 position:50% align:center
[ADVENTURERS laugh]

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:18.510 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
You take that back!

[ADVENTURER 6A]
'Scuse you?

00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:23.014 position:50% align:center
[HORN] Don't you ever talk about
my friends that way again!

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:24.140 position:50% align:center
They're incredible.

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
You could never be like them!

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:27.936 position:50% align:center
And every one of them
has worked as hard

00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:29.938 position:50% align:center
as they could to
protect this city!

00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:32.774 position:50% align:center
They risked their lives
to save us!

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:34.401 position:50% align:center
They're nothing like you.

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:35.860 position:50% align:center
You steal from those
weaker than you

00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
because you're not
strong enough to fight!

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:40.115 position:50% align:center
[ADVENTURER 6A]
Boo hoo!

00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
So those are your
final words, huh? Good.

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:46.079 position:50% align:center
Kill me, it's fine.

00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:49.207 position:50% align:center
I can die knowing I
stood up for my friends.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.293 position:50% align:center
I'd never forgive myself
if I played it safe!

00:20:52.377 --> 00:20:54.129 position:50% align:center
Great, then this'll be easy!

00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:57.215 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
This stench! You smell it?

00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:59.551 position:50% align:center
It reeks of monsters out here.

00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:01.803 position:50% align:center
[ADVENTURER 6B]
What? Who are you?

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:03.013 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Oh, hey, Horn.

00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
Did you know
enemies just spawned

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:05.974 position:50% align:center
in the middle of the city?

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:08.643 position:50% align:center
Too bad they're all
low-level trash monsters.

00:21:08.727 --> 00:21:10.437 position:50% align:center
Yeah! They are!

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.442 position:50% align:center
You bastard! Ready, set, attack!

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.863 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO chuckles]

00:21:22.657 --> 00:21:25.035 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] I made an
exception for you today.

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:27.454 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know. Thanks.

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:30.999 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
I... I'm so sorry.

00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:33.585 position:50% align:center
I hate that I wasn't
of any use to you.

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:35.545 position:50% align:center
I'll stop wasting your time.

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:37.922 position:50% align:center
I'll leave you guys alone.

00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:40.425 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Does she really
feel that worthless?

00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.553 position:50% align:center
[HORN gasps]

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:46.139 position:50% align:center
Did anyone ask you to leave us?

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:47.307 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
No.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.434 position:50% align:center
So you want to leave
on your own accord?

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.228 position:50% align:center
No! Absolutely not!

00:21:52.312 --> 00:21:54.105 position:50% align:center
I want to stay with you.

00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:56.399 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] No one in the group
has told you to go.

00:21:56.483 --> 00:21:59.486 position:50% align:center
And you're saying you definitely
don't want to leave.

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:03.698 position:50% align:center
So that sounds like
we all want you to stay.

00:22:03.782 --> 00:22:06.076 position:50% align:center
I don't get what the problem is.

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:09.621 position:50% align:center
Um. I guess there
really isn't a problem.

00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:11.539 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna leave.

00:22:11.623 --> 00:22:14.292 position:50% align:center
I wanna stay here with everyone!

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:17.170 position:50% align:center
Okay. Then you stay with us
as long as you like.

[HORN sniffles]
'Kay.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.090 position:50% align:center

Okay!

Um, I have allergies!

00:22:27.931 --> 00:22:28.723 position:50% align:center

That's crying.

more cookies at this table!

Oh look!

00:24:07.197 --> 00:24:08.990 position:50% align:center
The Demon Lord is
finally feeling motivated!

00:24:09.074 --> 00:24:11.284 position:50% align:center
[GALFORD] I cannot turn
a blind eye to a Demon Lord

00:24:11.368 --> 00:24:13.453 position:50% align:center
and a Fallen within the city.
