[TAKUMA gasps] Why is battleax
Laminitus standing in my room?

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:22.313 position:50% align:center
Looking thirsty as a cactus
in summer, I might add.

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:24.065 position:50% align:center
I have an offer for you.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.567 position:50% align:center
Please don't refuse.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.027 position:50% align:center
It's good for both of us.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.613 position:50% align:center
Make Zircon Tower your home
as long as you'd like.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:33.491 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA gasps]
Okay, that's not fair!

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:36.661 position:50% align:center
Besides, Lumachina asked
for my help first.

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:38.204 position:50% align:center
I don't think
the Church can help.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:41.499 position:50% align:center
As long as it's in the hands
of selfish, indulgent beings,

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:44.836 position:50% align:center
we're on our own against
the resurrected Demon Lord.

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.463 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Do you have a plan?

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:47.672 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Yes.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:49.632 position:50% align:center
I think I'll return
to the royal capital.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.176 position:50% align:center
That's a terrible idea.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:54.554 position:50% align:center
Have you forgotten that those
people are after your life?

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.306 position:50% align:center
Do you want to die?

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:57.974 position:50% align:center
Please, Diablo sir!

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:01.686 position:50% align:center
I beg you to consider lending me
your power for this mission.

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:04.939 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Ah, screw it. I'll go with her.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:07.317 position:50% align:center
Now to explain this to
Laminitus like a Demon Lord

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.194 position:50% align:center
and not a terrified plebe.

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:11.613 position:50% align:center
Well. My enemy's
in the royal capital,

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:15.575 position:50% align:center
so if you plan to interfere,
I suggest you get... moving?

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:17.702 position:50% align:center
I don't need to go
right away, do I?

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:21.414 position:50% align:center
I've prepared a hospitality
gift just for you.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:24.459 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] In what world
is this hospitality?

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:26.961 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS gasps]
What's that poking me?

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:29.130 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Horns!
You're grabbing my horns, lady!

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:32.967 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS sighs]
You're so strong and ox-like!

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:36.054 position:50% align:center
Hey! Careful, my body
is Level 150!

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:38.515 position:50% align:center
I can't help but
master everything I do.

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.810 position:50% align:center
There's no way you can
tell me you don't love this.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.937 position:50% align:center
I pressed your love button.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.523 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
What's wrong with her?

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:47.982 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS] You're never
gonna wanna leave me

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.360 position:50% align:center
after I'm done with you!

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.115 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] False! I want
to leave right now!

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:57.450 position:50% align:center
[gasps] There's a giant
Fallen stalking us!

00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:02.205 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hey! Where are you
going? Diablo!

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.837 position:50% align:center
I won't loosen
my grip next time.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.839 position:50% align:center
Just you wait.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.348 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Look, it's Faltra!

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:45.975 position:50% align:center
[REM] Finally back where
things make sense.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.103 position:50% align:center
I hope Klem and Edelgard
survived without us.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:49.229 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Mei was taking care of them,

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:51.523 position:50% align:center
so I'm sure they're just peachy!

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:52.982 position:50% align:center
So we're heading to
the royal capital

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.026 position:50% align:center
as soon as everyone's
ready, aren't we?

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which, we'll need
to find a carriage, first.

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.074 position:50% align:center
Lucky for you, I'm already
on top of that.

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:03.284 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Oh, can I go with you?

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.287 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:07.956 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
I was thinking.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
I'd like to find the church
in this city and pay a visit.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.627 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] Huh? Can't you
just pray in your head?

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:15.338 position:50% align:center
If you're being targeted
by control-freak Cardinals,

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
then any church is probably
the last place you should be.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.720 position:50% align:center
I'd assume the priest in
this town is an enemy, as well.

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.054 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
There was a horrible battle

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:24.973 position:50% align:center
against the Fallen
here recently.

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:28.184 position:50% align:center
Many citizens lost their lives.

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:31.521 position:50% align:center
I'd like to pray for
their sacrifice. As thanks.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.023 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.150 position:50% align:center
I know where it is!
I'll take you!

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:37.277 position:50% align:center
Seriously? She needs
someone to protect her,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
not make things worse.

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:39.904 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Really?

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50% align:center
[EMILE] Never fear!
For any woman in distress,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.411 position:50% align:center
this dashing local hero is here!

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.540 position:50% align:center
[EMILE]
My name is Emile Bichelberger!

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:53.001 position:50% align:center
A passionate protector
of all women.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:55.837 position:50% align:center
A man devoted to fighting
for honor and praise.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.089 position:50% align:center
Master, I don't
trust this human.

00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:00.383 position:50% align:center
Who is this gilded loser?

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:03.303 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] That entrance
was quite questionable.

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.805 position:50% align:center
I could absolutely
use your protection.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.974 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Sir, for offering it.

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:10.352 position:50% align:center
The trust of a woman
gives me strength!

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.228 position:50% align:center
These arms of steel
will keep you safe!

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.772 position:50% align:center
[SYLVIE]
Put 'em away!

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.357 position:50% align:center
You know better than
to accept a quest

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.067 position:50% align:center
in the middle of another quest!

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.778 position:50% align:center
[EMILE groans]
Oh c'mon, G-M!

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.654 position:50% align:center
There's a woman
who needs protection!

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.198 position:50% align:center
Who else has these pecs?

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:24.741 position:50% align:center
[SYLVIE] The only thing you
should be flexing around here

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50% align:center
is your swordsmanship.

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.286 position:50% align:center
[REM] I thought I heard
your voice. Hi, Sylv!

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.746 position:50% align:center
Good to see you!

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.498 position:50% align:center
Hi Rem, welcome back.

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:32.624 position:50% align:center
Shera.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.125 position:50% align:center
Yo! Deebowski!

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50% align:center
And you picked up some new
lady strays on the way, I see.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:38.421 position:50% align:center
It's not without good reason.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.340 position:50% align:center
Trust me, Deebs, I remember!

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way, in case
you're looking for her,

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:45.387 position:50% align:center
Klem's at Peter's, a bakery
in the southern district.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.848 position:50% align:center
What for? Is she stocking up
on cookies or something?

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
Nah. More random than that.

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.812 position:50% align:center
Edelgard is working
there part-time.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:55.480 position:50% align:center
[REM] Because being
a Fallen doesn't pay

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50% align:center
as much as it used to, or?

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.486 position:50% align:center
[ROSE] Is this it?
The bakery in question?

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:02.779 position:50% align:center
It is.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.283 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
What the crap is that mess?

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:12.831 position:50% align:center
It looks like a party
shop threw up in here!

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:18.586 position:50% align:center
[EDELGARD] Oh my!
Isn't this a pleasant surprise?

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.005 position:50% align:center
Welcome home.

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:22.507 position:50% align:center
Wait. Diablo?

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.009 position:50% align:center
I was told you would be here.

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.344 position:50% align:center
I just wasn't sure
what to believe.

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:28.555 position:50% align:center
Cookies do not grow on trees.

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:30.849 position:50% align:center
The Demon Lord must
pay money for them,

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:35.437 position:50% align:center
and I must earn that money or
she will starve, she says. So.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.855 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Man, that's gotta suck.

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:40.191 position:50% align:center
[MEI]
Hey! Is that you, Diablo?

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:44.738 position:50% align:center
Welcome back!
What a surprise! Meow-meow!

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.282 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute, aren't you
Mei from the inn?

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.367 position:50% align:center
What happened to Peace of Mind?

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:53.913 position:50% align:center
To tell you the truth,
business has taken a nosedive.

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:55.457 position:50% align:center
After the Demon Lord came back,

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.293 position:50% align:center
people stopped wanting
to travel west.

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:01.338 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Yeesh. Sucks to be her, too.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.715 position:50% align:center
[MEI]
But meow we have a Fallen café!

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:06.384 position:50% align:center
We know you'll be
purr-fectly comfortable here!

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:08.386 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] They converted it
into a Fallen café

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
to keep Edelgard from
standing out. Smart.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.600 position:50% align:center
[PETER] Last time I checked, you
weren't paid to stand around.

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:15.226 position:50% align:center
Right. Sorry, boss.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.313 position:50% align:center
I swear. We really are
a normal bakery, sir.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
But ever since we
hired Edelgard,

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.817 position:50% align:center
you never know
what you'll walk into.

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:25.070 position:50% align:center
These are so yummy!

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:26.154 position:50% align:center
Where'd she come from?

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:28.573 position:50% align:center
Klem, have you been here
this whole time?

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:30.825 position:50% align:center
Delish! Go bring out
more cookies.

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:32.744 position:50% align:center
I'm almost done!

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50% align:center
Really? You've eaten nothing
but cookies since this morning.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:39.084 position:50% align:center
Why don't you try
a vegetable or something?

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
No. The Demon Lord has spoken.

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:44.881 position:50% align:center
Her requests are
final. Now, obey!

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:49.135 position:50% align:center
You can refuse,
but she'll kill you.

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:51.971 position:50% align:center
[PETER] I'll get started
on a new batch!

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:54.224 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Poor guy.
I hope he's hanging in there.

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:56.976 position:50% align:center
The peace of the world
relies on his shop's cookies!

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.436 position:50% align:center
[KREBSKULM]
Glad you made it in one piece!

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.854 position:50% align:center
Good deal.

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:03.024 position:50% align:center
This isn't my final stop.
The royal capital is next.

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:05.485 position:50% align:center
Did you do something dumb
and end up in trouble again?

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.237 position:50% align:center
You could put it that way.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center
[KREBSKULM chuckles] You're
giving me a total 'Hero' vibe

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:11.825 position:50% align:center
with this frequency
of screw-ups.

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:15.537 position:50% align:center
How dare you say that to me!
I'm a powerful Demon Lord!

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.414 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Although being in
this store makes me look like

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.083 position:50% align:center
I'm cosplaying with
the rest of these jerks.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.334 position:50% align:center
So, spill it.

00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:23.586 position:50% align:center

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
So then. Tell me.

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:21.796 position:50% align:center
What organization hired you?

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.799 position:50% align:center
The Lord? Commerce Guild?
How much did they pay you?

00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:29.012 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] This is their boss?
Some short, crusty, old dude?

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:30.055 position:50% align:center
How 'bout this.

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:32.307 position:50% align:center
Work with me!
I'll pay you double.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.850 position:50% align:center
What do you say?

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.561 position:50% align:center
Gee, it's too bad I don't care
about mortal organizations.

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:37.562 position:50% align:center
Like, at all.

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:40.065 position:50% align:center
The only thing
I want is revenge!

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:43.026 position:50% align:center
Huh? What on earth
are you talking about?

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:45.487 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Yeah, that one
is a little unclear.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.946 position:50% align:center
Why would anyone
expect a Demon Lord

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.325 position:50% align:center
to attack someone for
ruining her cookies?

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:52.452 position:50% align:center
I'll slaughter every
single one of you!

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:54.871 position:50% align:center
Save your sob stories of regret!

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
You can tell me about it
in the afterlife!

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.375 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Oh, hell no!

00:15:58.458 --> 00:15:59.376 position:50% align:center
Hold on!

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:03.588 position:50% align:center
Go, Infinity Detonation!

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:09.552 position:50% align:center
[gasps, screams]

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.563 position:50% align:center
[KREBSKULM]
Hey. What the heck, man?

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:23.900 position:50% align:center
Why are you saving every
frikkin cookie ruin-er I find?

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:26.736 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
The answer is, I don't care

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.154 position:50% align:center
if they're a villain or not.

00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center
I don't want to kill anyone.

00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:32.033 position:50% align:center
But I can't say that
out loud as a Demon Lord.

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:32.867 position:50% align:center
So now what?

00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:35.078 position:50% align:center
[EDELGARD]
Oh, I know.

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:37.831 position:50% align:center
Let's tear off his limbs!
Then we can mince them!

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:40.166 position:50% align:center
That would definitely teach him
the weight of his sins.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.876 position:50% align:center
[MEASMOS gasps]

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:43.878 position:50% align:center
Get back!

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:46.423 position:50% align:center
Don't either of you
think about it!

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:47.966 position:50% align:center
If we kill him,
it won't make up for

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:49.843 position:50% align:center
the evil deeds
he's already done.

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:52.929 position:50% align:center
But at least he won't be able to
do anything to anyone else.

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:54.389 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Forget it!

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
Everyone on my team is sick
and obsessed with murder!

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
Wait! I have a thought!

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:00.687 position:50% align:center
Let's make him apologize
for his crimes!

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.523 position:50% align:center
Apologize? What makes
you think that's enough?

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:05.108 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:07.694 position:50% align:center
It seems like it wouldn't be,
but, when I do something wrong,

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center
the boss makes me apologize
and do the dishes.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.991 position:50% align:center
Yes! That's it!
That's what we want to do!

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
Make him atone
by doing good deeds

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:16.369 position:50% align:center
equal to the crimes
he's committed.

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:20.040 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I think I like that idea
even better, Diablo!

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50% align:center
Just leave it to you
to be a genius!

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:23.960 position:50% align:center
Did you hear that, ya punk?

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:26.212 position:50% align:center
Yes, miss! I heard him
quite clearly!

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:27.297 position:50% align:center
[KREBSKULM]
Are you sure?

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.424 position:50% align:center
What did he say
you would do to repent?

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:32.552 position:50% align:center
He said I would do
good deeds as payment.

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:34.012 position:50% align:center
You were listening!

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
And just so you know,
if you deceive this Demon Lord,

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:38.933 position:50% align:center
I get to feed you to
a hundred monsters.

00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:40.560 position:50% align:center
And they're starving.

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:42.145 position:50% align:center
[MEASMOS cries]

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:46.399 position:50% align:center
[KREBSKULM laughs]

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:49.778 position:50% align:center
[KREBSKULM]
Ugh, that smell!

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:53.239 position:50% align:center
I don't know why you drag that
God-breath woman around.

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:55.367 position:50% align:center
So now he has to shine
your shoes, or what?

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.243 position:50% align:center
Sounds like you
went through a lot.

00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:59.746 position:50% align:center
All in a day's work for Diablo.

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:03.667 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we're so proud of you!

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.001 position:50% align:center
[GALFORD]
Pardon me.

00:18:09.673 --> 00:18:12.425 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I'm gonna puke!
Is that Galford?

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:16.012 position:50% align:center
[GALFORD] Greetings, Diablo.
It's been a while.

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:19.015 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here?
I'm in the middle of dinner.

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
I've not come for you today.

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:22.644 position:50% align:center
I'm after that child!

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:25.730 position:50% align:center
She's the subject
of concern lately.

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:28.274 position:50% align:center
Huh? Who the heck are you?

00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:31.778 position:50% align:center
I'm the Lord in charge of
the Fortress City of Faltra.

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
My name is Chester Ray Galford.

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:36.825 position:50% align:center
Oh. You're the one
in charge of the city.

00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50% align:center
Kudos. The cookies here
are like no other!

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.163 position:50% align:center
I'm their biggest fan!

00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:43.998 position:50% align:center
[GALFORD] One of my
subordinates went undercover

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:45.583 position:50% align:center
with a certain organization

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:47.919 position:50% align:center
and delivered an
intriguing report.

00:18:48.003 --> 00:18:50.255 position:50% align:center
He said a young girl
attacked him and his soldiers

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:52.215 position:50% align:center
with magic he'd
never seen before.

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:55.176 position:50% align:center
And then the girl claimed
she was a Demon Lord.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.636 position:50% align:center
Was that you?

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.764 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] He had men undercover
with the Measmos family?

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center
There's a fine line between

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
passionate and creepy,
Mister Galford.

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:06.187 position:50% align:center
Mister Lord, keep in mind
that Klem's a child!

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:08.648 position:50% align:center
I understand. And I've
been around long enough

00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:10.984 position:50% align:center
to know not to
believe every report.

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:12.068 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Word.

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:13.611 position:50% align:center
I'll conduct a
thorough investigation

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:16.031 position:50% align:center
at our military facility.

00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:18.575 position:50% align:center
That's fair, right?
Surely you won't refuse?

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
Um, that's fine.

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.202 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:25.582 position:50% align:center
Do you intend to
take action against me?

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:27.625 position:50% align:center
I would prefer not to.

00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:29.961 position:50% align:center
But I can't turn a
blind eye to a Demon Lord

00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
and Fallen within
the city bounds.

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:35.383 position:50% align:center
Even if it costs me my life.

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:38.636 position:50% align:center
[MEI]
Ahem? Meow?

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:40.680 position:50% align:center
[GALFORD]
Who's there?

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:42.682 position:50% align:center
Pardon me for
interrupting you, meow.

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:45.226 position:50% align:center
The bakery owner's here.
Can we see Klem?

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Hello.

00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
Hello, Bakery Owner!
What did you need?

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50% align:center
Well, you see, a messenger
from the Measmos family

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center
came by and said they won't
demand tribute anymore.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.448 position:50% align:center
They even left an
apology note and money!

00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:00.825 position:50% align:center
It said they were keeping
their promise to Klem!

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:04.621 position:50% align:center
Because of you,
I can keep the shop going!

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:06.748 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:08.291 position:50% align:center
That's great news!

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:11.127 position:50% align:center
I couldn't have done it without
Diablo's encouragement!

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:14.881 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?
I didn't do anything.

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:18.385 position:50% align:center
Come back soon,
Demon Lords. Anytime.

00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center
Oh, Mister Galford,
in case it sounds weird,

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:24.391 position:50% align:center
'Demon Lord' is just a name
we use for fun in the shop.

00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:26.393 position:50% align:center
Like a game?

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:29.312 position:50% align:center
[CELES] My goodness!
Nice to see you, Lord.

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:31.940 position:50% align:center
[GALFORD]
Celestine Baudelaire?

00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
Should you be walking
around alone at night?

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:36.277 position:50% align:center
Ordinarily I wouldn't be.

00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:39.072 position:50% align:center
But I really needed
to thank Klem.

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:41.282 position:50% align:center
The people who pretended
to be selling these items

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:44.661 position:50% align:center
for the Mage's Association
came by to apologize.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
I'm told it's because of you.

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:48.039 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful.

00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:50.291 position:50% align:center
I am pretty awesome.

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:53.795 position:50% align:center
[MEI]
P.S.

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center
[GALFORD]
Is there something else?

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:58.174 position:50% align:center
[giggles] Yes, meow!

00:20:58.258 --> 00:20:59.884 position:50% align:center
There are a lot more
people who came by

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:01.553 position:50% align:center
to say thank you to Klem!

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:03.054 position:50% align:center
Can I let them in, meow?

00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50% align:center
[MAN 7C] Those men won't be
coming to our shop anymore!

00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:08.184 position:50% align:center
--Yo, yo!
--Yo, sho'ty-Klem!

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:11.271 position:50% align:center
We were down and lost all hope,
but you saved our shop.

00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:13.273 position:50% align:center
Dang girl, you're dope!

00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:17.152 position:50% align:center
We came to drop thanks
and I love yous!

00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:18.570 position:50% align:center
You rule!

00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:21.072 position:50% align:center
Aw yeah!

00:21:21.156 --> 00:21:25.076 position:50% align:center
Huh. I think I'll
be leaving now.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.329 position:50% align:center
Oh. Why? We cramping
your style or something?

00:21:28.413 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
No other Demon Lord has gained

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:31.958 position:50% align:center
such praise from
so many citizens.

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:33.710 position:50% align:center
I'm of no use here.

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:36.921 position:50% align:center
Besides, there's not enough time
to engage in investigations.

00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:39.466 position:50% align:center
Such pointless suspicions.

00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:40.925 position:50% align:center

Thank goodness.

[LUMACHINA]
Thank you for all your help.

00:21:49.851 --> 00:21:53.188 position:50% align:center
You were a lifesaver,
Emile Bichelberger.

00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:55.815 position:50% align:center
Alas, it is a shame
I can't go with you!

00:21:55.899 --> 00:21:58.318 position:50% align:center
Guess we're not surprised
the Head Priest made it.

00:21:58.401 --> 00:21:59.819 position:50% align:center
Nah, she's hardcore.

00:21:59.903 --> 00:22:01.696 position:50% align:center
Man I'd hate to
be you right now.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.948 position:50% align:center
But good luck! You got this!

00:22:04.032 --> 00:22:05.909 position:50% align:center
Ha. How soon they forget.

I'm still a Demon Lord.

Now, let's head out!

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.418 position:50% align:center
To the Great Cathedral
of the royal capital.

Oh? So Lumachina's
still alive, is she?

00:22:21.883 --> 00:22:23.343 position:50% align:center
Yes sir.

[VISHOS]
I guess it doesn't matter.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.264 position:50% align:center
There's no way she'll
make it in time.

[ALICIA] This world needs
a purge brought on

[VISHOS]
Welcome home, Miss Lumachina.

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.492 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] No matter
how great the cost may be,

00:24:10.575 --> 00:24:13.244 position:50% align:center
you must repent for
the sins you've committed!
