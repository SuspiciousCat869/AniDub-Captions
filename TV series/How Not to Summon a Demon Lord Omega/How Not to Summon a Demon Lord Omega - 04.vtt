00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.434 position:50% align:center
Listen up!

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:20.979 position:50% align:center
We're heading out on foot
to the dungeon Horn mentioned!

00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50% align:center
Lumachina, once we arrive,

00:00:22.648 --> 00:00:25.651 position:50% align:center
we'll find a hidden treasure
that creates miracles.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.111 position:50% align:center
It shall be yours if you desire!

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.614 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] Thank you.
We would put that to good use.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:33.575 position:50% align:center
Too many people are suffering
from the Death Kell Disease.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.453 position:50% align:center
Then we should hurry up!
Sounds like folks need her help!

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:37.871 position:50% align:center
I can lead us to the dungeon!

00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:39.581 position:50% align:center
All you have to do is follow me!

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:43.961 position:50% align:center
Uh-- So, uh, are they
coming with us?

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.045 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO gasps]

00:01:00.644 --> 00:01:02.062 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
What does she want?

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:40.869 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
We're totally surrounded!

00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:43.622 position:50% align:center
This cannot be
happening right now!

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.875 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] That battle with
Batutta dried me out.

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.877 position:50% align:center
What do they want?

00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:50.796 position:50% align:center
I barely have any
Hit Points to spare,

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.006 position:50% align:center
or Magic Points for that matter.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.843 position:50% align:center
And now I'm supposed to fight
a high-level Magi-Gunner?

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:57.135 position:50% align:center
Cool, cool, cool.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:59.179 position:50% align:center
I received a report
that you entered our land

00:02:59.263 --> 00:03:00.597 position:50% align:center
from the depths of the earth.

00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:03.600 position:50% align:center
And now I have
a question for you.

00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:06.562 position:50% align:center
Are you the Demon Lord
that Varakness told us about?

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:08.063 position:50% align:center
Who's Varakness?

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:10.065 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter,
don't demon-out on her!

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:13.402 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she's right.
Ix-nay about the emon lord-day!

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:19.283 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
I'm trying! But it's hard!

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:20.826 position:50% align:center
Why can't I come up
with a better line

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.911 position:50% align:center
than that tired
commercial slogan?

00:03:22.995 --> 00:03:25.455 position:50% align:center
Probably the same reason
my social skills are balls!

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.083 position:50% align:center
I am known as Diablo,
the Demon Lord!

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.335 position:50% align:center
There are none
who stand in my way!

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.380 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Ah, great, he's done it now.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:37.384 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO chuckles]
I don't need to run from you!

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.304 position:50% align:center
If you want to die,
keep crawling this way!

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.973 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS] Ha! What a
vicious bark you have.

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.142 position:50% align:center
Surely that wasn't
a real invitation?

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.477 position:50% align:center
Sounds to me like
somebody needs a nap.

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.188 position:50% align:center
Don't you agree?

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:53.901 position:50% align:center
What's happening?

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:55.485 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.739 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] How does she have that
many soldiers with Magi-Guns?

00:04:00.324 --> 00:04:02.451 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Guess I have no choice.

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:05.495 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
No, wait! Please believe me.

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.207 position:50% align:center
This is not a man you want
to turn your weapons on.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
He saved me.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.502 position:50% align:center
He saved this entire town.

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:13.045 position:50% align:center
Right now, all he's
doing is trying to

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:15.255 position:50% align:center
help as many people as he can.

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:18.842 position:50% align:center
I swear. He is not an enemy
to the mortal races.

00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:21.803 position:50% align:center
If that's true, then why does he
call himself a Demon Lord?

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:23.305 position:50% align:center
Well. That's a good question.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.307 position:50% align:center
Lord Laminitus!

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.809 position:50% align:center
We'd love to stay and have
a chat, but unfortunately,

00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:29.561 position:50% align:center
we're running late
to a dungeon date.

00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:32.648 position:50% align:center
We're picking up a cure
for the Death Knell Disease.

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.650 position:50% align:center
Could you wait until
we come back with it?

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
You might want to use it, too!

00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:39.613 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS] As if a cure
for such a disease exists!

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
How unfortunate!

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:42.908 position:50% align:center
You're wasting your time
chasing a scam!

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.536 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] Does it look as
though I have time to waste?

00:04:48.247 --> 00:04:49.957 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] They're on
their way to the dungeon

00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:55.254 position:50% align:center
to save others like me who have
this Death Knell Disease.

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:56.880 position:50% align:center
Let them go!

00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:59.508 position:50% align:center
Oh? In that case, I'm intrigued!

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:02.469 position:50% align:center
You'll have to tell me
more about this.

00:05:02.553 --> 00:05:04.972 position:50% align:center
But another time! Seize them!

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:07.766 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] This would not be
a great place to be captured.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.602 position:50% align:center
Oh Earth, pulse violently!

00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:13.397 position:50% align:center
Now. Go Earth Bounce!

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.523 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:23.657 position:50% align:center
Hey! It's only the ground
around us that isn't shaking!

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.534 position:50% align:center
No matter what, stay by my side!

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:28.787 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS gasping]

00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:29.997 position:50% align:center
Keep up!

00:05:33.292 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
[SHERA whines] I'm about to
chew off my own hand!

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.422 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Well hurry up and eat!

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.883 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
It looks so good, thank you!

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:43.010 position:50% align:center
Who taught you how to
make meat sticks?

00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:44.553 position:50% align:center
Way to go.

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:46.889 position:50% align:center
[HORN laughs] Taught myself here
in my secret hideaway spot.

00:05:46.972 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
It was God who led us to you.

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.476 position:50% align:center
He's been incredibly
good to us all.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.229 position:50% align:center
It's so incredibly good!

00:05:54.313 --> 00:05:56.148 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Something tells me
that Laminitus woman

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:57.941 position:50% align:center
allowed us to escape.

00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:00.068 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Shera, are you okay?

00:06:00.152 --> 00:06:02.196 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Her Crimsom Wings were equipped.

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.614 position:50% align:center
She could've shot us
with her Magi-Gun

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.449 position:50% align:center
from the air at anytime.

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:08.368 position:50% align:center
We were running away from
her with our backs turned.

00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:10.579 position:50% align:center
Easy enough to murder the group.

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.749 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
So why didn't she try to?

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:18.670 position:50% align:center
Here, eat mine.
No one likes a hangry demon.

00:06:18.754 --> 00:06:20.797 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Oh, right.

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:23.884 position:50% align:center
Huh? What did she
just say to me?

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:26.970 position:50% align:center
Don't go hungry.
Please eat mine.

00:06:28.347 --> 00:06:30.182 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Indirect kiss?

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:32.935 position:50% align:center
Rem, you shouldn't be
eating meat that's so raw.

00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:35.187 position:50% align:center
Eat mine, it's hot and ready.

00:06:37.523 --> 00:06:40.150 position:50% align:center
Eat mine, it's hot and ready.

00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:42.319 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Her, too? What is this?

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center
This kind is better raw,
you uncultured elf!

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.950 position:50% align:center
No, you have to cook it unless
you wanna get sick and die!

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:49.201 position:50% align:center
We're supposed to eat it rare!

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:50.369 position:50% align:center
If you like throwing up!

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:51.828 position:50% align:center
--Those're hairballs!
--That's so gross!

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:53.205 position:50% align:center
--Is not!
--Is too!

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.082 position:50% align:center
--Is not!
--Is too!

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:56.625 position:50% align:center
Okay! Enough!

00:06:56.708 --> 00:07:00.128 position:50% align:center
According to Horn, it'll take
us three days to arrive.

00:07:00.212 --> 00:07:01.964 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and eat and go to bed!

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:04.091 position:50% align:center
[SHERA, REM]
Sorry. 'Kay.

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:06.093 position:50% align:center
[REM]
It's still better when it's raw.

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:07.886 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Raw meat sticks are so gross!

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.055 position:50% align:center
[REM] According to
Chef Sloppy Elf? Great!

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.224 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Ladies, it's just meat!

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.435 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT] It is an honor to
make your acquaintance.

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:19.356 position:50% align:center
Your name is well known in the
royal capital, Lord Laminitus.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.774 position:50% align:center
You're wasting your time.

00:07:20.858 --> 00:07:23.193 position:50% align:center
All I want to know
is why I'm here.

00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:25.153 position:50% align:center
[GEWALT] I heard the
Head Priest was here in town,

00:07:25.237 --> 00:07:29.408 position:50% align:center
so I'm offering my services
to protect her as needed.

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:31.535 position:50% align:center
The Head Priest? Are you sure?

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.663 position:50% align:center
Yes. Also, I've come bearing
an important message for you

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:38.041 position:50% align:center
from the Church that we're
hoping you'll find quite useful.

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:39.126 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS]
It's too late.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
She's disappeared
with some sorcerer

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.088 position:50% align:center
who calls himself a Demon Lord.

00:07:43.172 --> 00:07:46.592 position:50% align:center
You caught me in the middle of
hunting them down myself.

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:48.427 position:50% align:center
That sorcerer is troublesome.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.678 position:50% align:center
He's deceiving the Head Priest

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:52.556 position:50% align:center
and is keeping her
from her duties!

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:56.185 position:50% align:center
Huh. What does any of this
have to do with me?

00:07:56.268 --> 00:07:57.728 position:50% align:center

I have news!

00:07:58.687 --> 00:07:59.771 position:50% align:center
Come in!

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:01.982 position:50% align:center
[HENRICK]
We've discovered the location

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:03.525 position:50% align:center
of the dungeon
they're heading to.

00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:04.902 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS]
Where is it?

00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:08.822 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] I'm so excited!
We finally made it!

00:08:08.906 --> 00:08:11.950 position:50% align:center
[REM] I can't believe it took us
three days to find this place.

00:08:12.034 --> 00:08:13.202 position:50% align:center
It's here?

00:08:13.285 --> 00:08:15.454 position:50% align:center
The cure for the Death
Knell Disease is inside?

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center
Right. We'll obtain it before
you reach all nine marks.

00:08:18.582 --> 00:08:19.833 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:21.043 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:22.544 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
This is nuts.

00:08:22.628 --> 00:08:25.881 position:50% align:center
I never thought I'd be taking on
the dungeon I made myself.

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:28.091 position:50% align:center
Perfect! Well,
let's get a move-on!

00:08:28.175 --> 00:08:30.511 position:50% align:center
Wait! Don't go in there!

00:08:30.594 --> 00:08:33.388 position:50% align:center
You have to approach
an entrance carefully!

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:37.059 position:50% align:center

Go Explosion!

How did you know to do that?

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling.

00:08:49.655 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] And I built
that trap myself, so.

00:08:52.074 --> 00:08:53.742 position:50% align:center
Wow, that's really powerful.

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:56.453 position:50% align:center
Seriously? This is your fault!

00:08:56.537 --> 00:08:58.747 position:50% align:center
I'm so over dumb elves!

00:09:03.669 --> 00:09:06.004 position:50% align:center
[REM]
The door! It's open!

00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:11.218 position:50% align:center
Now, let's go.

00:09:12.553 --> 00:09:15.889 position:50% align:center
[HORN] This dungeon takes you
further and further underground.

00:09:15.973 --> 00:09:18.934 position:50% align:center
There's a trick to every floor,
and once you figure it out,

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:21.770 position:50% align:center
the stairs to the
next floor appear.

00:09:22.646 --> 00:09:24.857 position:50% align:center
[HORN] This is the first floor
so the first thing we do

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.984 position:50% align:center
is solve a giant labyrinth!

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.777 position:50% align:center
If you get lost,
you're done for,

00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:31.154 position:50% align:center
because you can't find
the entrance either!

00:09:31.238 --> 00:09:32.489 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
That's scary!

00:09:32.573 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
So then what do we do
if we get separated?

00:09:34.825 --> 00:09:38.161 position:50% align:center
Well. You could be killed by
a monster, or starve to death,

00:09:38.245 --> 00:09:39.413 position:50% align:center
it's really your call.

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:40.873 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna do either.

00:09:40.956 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
Don't be a dummy.

00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:45.127 position:50% align:center
Obviously someone would
find you eventually.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.628 position:50% align:center
[SHERA sighs]

00:09:46.712 --> 00:09:49.214 position:50% align:center
You'll be a skeleton
by then, though.

00:09:49.298 --> 00:09:53.093 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] I don't like
this story at all! Stop!

00:09:53.177 --> 00:09:56.597 position:50% align:center
Diablo! Rem's so mean!

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.558 position:50% align:center
She said you're gonna
leave me behind!

00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:00.726 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
That's it!

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:02.186 position:50% align:center
If I want to reassure
a frightened lady,

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:03.604 position:50% align:center
I need to respond
to these attacks

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:05.856 position:50% align:center
with purpose and conviction!

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.858 position:50% align:center
Get those off of me!

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:10.110 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Now she knows I'm in control.

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:12.696 position:50% align:center
Uh-- What?

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.156 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Why is she crying? I fixed it!

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:15.574 position:50% align:center
Look, Elf.

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.075 position:50% align:center
If you keep clinging like
a desperate piece of lint,

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:20.245 position:50% align:center
he won't be able to fight
for us when we need him.

00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:24.917 position:50% align:center
Right, sorry. Please forgive me.

00:10:26.043 --> 00:10:28.420 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
I don't deserve you, Rem!

00:10:28.504 --> 00:10:31.048 position:50% align:center
So then, how do we
get through the labyrinth?

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.424 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Leave it to me!

00:10:32.508 --> 00:10:34.635 position:50% align:center
I have the solution from
the last time I was here,

00:10:34.718 --> 00:10:37.346 position:50% align:center
so I can get us
out of it no problem!

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:41.683 position:50% align:center
I spent half a day navigating
and notating for this map.

00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:43.727 position:50% align:center
What the? No way?

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.604 position:50% align:center
The labyrinth looks
completely different!

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:47.272 position:50% align:center
That's how this labyrinth works.

00:10:47.356 --> 00:10:49.483 position:50% align:center
Each of the walls
shifts over time.

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:51.318 position:50% align:center
The layout frequently changes.

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:53.320 position:50% align:center
Mapping it is useless.

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:57.574 position:50% align:center
So uh. Where did you
get that inside scoop?

00:10:57.658 --> 00:11:00.827 position:50% align:center
Rem. I'm a Demon Lord from
another world, we know things.

00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:02.412 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
That was close.

00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
All right, we don't have
much time to waste here.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.212 position:50% align:center
Open a path before me!
Flare Burst!

00:11:13.382 --> 00:11:14.967 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.101 position:50% align:center
[HORN] You just made
your own way through!

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
That was incredible!

00:11:26.228 --> 00:11:29.398 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Man, I'm obsessed
with me right now.

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:30.774 position:50% align:center
Move.

00:11:30.858 --> 00:11:33.193 position:50% align:center
Wait! Why are you
rushing us down there?

00:11:33.277 --> 00:11:35.487 position:50% align:center
What if something's waiting
to kill somewhere?

00:11:35.571 --> 00:11:36.613 position:50% align:center
We need to move with caution

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:38.991 position:50% align:center
if we intend to
get out of here alive!

00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:40.659 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Okay, time out.

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
If I can't say "I'm the one
who made this dungeon,

00:11:42.995 --> 00:11:44.663 position:50% align:center
we'll be fine. Follow me."

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:46.039 position:50% align:center
Then how do I get them to move?

00:11:46.123 --> 00:11:49.585 position:50% align:center
They're clearly terrified,
so I can't leave them.

00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:51.962 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll have to
Demon my way through it.

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.547 position:50% align:center
You can stay if you want.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
But I won't pretend to be
afraid of nonsense.

00:11:56.175 --> 00:11:59.136 position:50% align:center
I've invited you to join me,
but it's not a demand.

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:01.680 position:50% align:center
If you're coming,
then stay quiet!

00:12:03.265 --> 00:12:05.142 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Please come with me!

00:12:09.021 --> 00:12:10.564 position:50% align:center
Fine, you don't have to yell.

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:11.815 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:13.317 position:50% align:center
That was pretty harsh.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.818 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Don't let it get to you.

00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:17.279 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Oh come on, Rem, wake up!

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:22.576 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
What the heck?

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:24.369 position:50% align:center
Diablo's been acting
like a jerk lately.

00:12:24.453 --> 00:12:26.747 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I wonder if
he needs more sleep

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.624 position:50% align:center
or has lower GI issues.

00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:30.751 position:50% align:center
I wish he'd tell us
so we can help.

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:33.003 position:50% align:center
Help what?
It could be that we...

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] There are dudes
who hang out with girls

00:12:34.463 --> 00:12:36.882 position:50% align:center
without this happening.

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.634 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Virus Cloud!

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:42.304 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Plasma Spear!

00:12:45.474 --> 00:12:46.642 position:50% align:center
Way to go!

00:12:46.725 --> 00:12:47.643 position:50% align:center
Horn, what's next?

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:49.102 position:50% align:center
Yay!

00:12:50.187 --> 00:12:54.316 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] So hot, it's
too much! Make it stop!

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
[REM] Seriously, Elf?
Now's not the time!

00:12:57.653 --> 00:13:00.280 position:50% align:center
Why's it so hard for you
to keep your clothes on?

00:13:00.364 --> 00:13:02.032 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
You're one to talk!

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:03.450 position:50% align:center
Uh-- [gasps]

00:13:03.534 --> 00:13:06.828 position:50% align:center
Well, it must be the heat.

00:13:06.912 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
Whatever! I was just hot.
You're trying to advertise!

00:13:10.207 --> 00:13:12.668 position:50% align:center
Not true! I'm hot, too!

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:15.754 position:50% align:center
All right, let's get
a move on--[gasps]

00:13:15.838 --> 00:13:17.130 position:50% align:center
So hot.

00:13:17.214 --> 00:13:20.217 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. We'll help you
clear this dungeon.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.135 position:50% align:center
No matter what!

00:13:22.219 --> 00:13:24.721 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Wow, she really
does give a crap.

00:13:24.805 --> 00:13:27.349 position:50% align:center
Right! What's the next question?

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:29.059 position:50% align:center
[DUNGEON MASTER 4A]
Question Number four!

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:30.811 position:50% align:center
Where does the
Spotted Snake live?

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:33.689 position:50% align:center
In the water, treetops,
or in holes?

00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:35.858 position:50% align:center
Um, okay. This is
my turn, right?

00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:36.859 position:50% align:center
Please stay calm.

00:13:36.942 --> 00:13:38.110 position:50% align:center
You got this!

00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:39.653 position:50% align:center
Water. Treetops.

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.364 position:50% align:center
Uh. No, those snakes
live in holes!

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:43.824 position:50% align:center
[DUNGEON MASTER 4A buzzes]

00:13:43.907 --> 00:13:45.409 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:46.910 position:50% align:center
[DUNGEON MASTER 4A] Incorrect!
I will now lower the gondola!

00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:49.663 position:50% align:center
[ALL scream]

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:52.332 position:50% align:center
Is this the end?

00:13:52.416 --> 00:13:54.710 position:50% align:center
--[TAKUMA] No! No! No!
--[REM] Diablo, help!

00:13:58.046 --> 00:13:59.423 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
This is not good.

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:00.883 position:50% align:center
If we don't get
the next question right,

00:14:00.966 --> 00:14:03.218 position:50% align:center
the only clothing left
to lose is undies.

00:14:03.302 --> 00:14:04.803 position:50% align:center
[ALL scream]

00:14:04.887 --> 00:14:07.514 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] And then we'll all be
taking a dive into burning lava!

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:12.728 position:50% align:center
[DUNGEON MASTER 4A]
And now, our final question!

00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:14.646 position:50% align:center
I know you'll get it, Lumachina!

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:15.939 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:14:16.023 --> 00:14:17.149 position:50% align:center
[DUNGEON MASTER 4A]
This question is about

00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:19.234 position:50% align:center
the "black book" monsters.

00:14:19.318 --> 00:14:22.529 position:50% align:center
Which one of them
is the largest?

00:14:22.613 --> 00:14:23.780 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
We're dead.

00:14:23.864 --> 00:14:26.408 position:50% align:center
Lumachina's hardly ever
been outside the Church.

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
There's no way
she knows anything

00:14:27.618 --> 00:14:29.661 position:50% align:center
about the size of monsters!

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.333 position:50% align:center
[DUNGEON MASTER 4A] Here are
your choices. Legend--

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center
It's the Legend Dragon!

00:14:38.212 --> 00:14:39.796 position:50% align:center
[DUNGEON MASTER 4A]
That is correct!

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.466 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
We did it!

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:44.301 position:50% align:center
So close.

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:45.594 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA gasps]
What?

00:14:45.677 --> 00:14:47.638 position:50% align:center
Those are boobs! So are those!

00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:49.264 position:50% align:center
They're everywhere!

00:14:49.348 --> 00:14:52.559 position:50% align:center
[REM] Yes, please reveal
what's behind the second door.

00:14:52.643 --> 00:14:55.103 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
I can't take anymore hot stuff.

00:14:55.187 --> 00:14:57.564 position:50% align:center
Diablo? What's the matter?

00:14:57.648 --> 00:14:59.525 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's nothing.

00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:14.039 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Whoa! Where did they come from?

00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:16.875 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
So many White Jagers!

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:20.754 position:50% align:center
[REM]
That's weird. They seem bored.

00:15:20.838 --> 00:15:23.090 position:50% align:center
Almost like they're waiting
for something to happen.

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:24.591 position:50% align:center
This looks like a stage.

00:15:24.675 --> 00:15:26.343 position:50% align:center
Are they here to see
a performance?

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.637 position:50% align:center
Wait, now that you mention it,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.139 position:50% align:center
the door leading to
this dungeon floor said,

00:15:31.223 --> 00:15:34.393 position:50% align:center
"Perform a lovely show
and the path shall open."

00:15:34.476 --> 00:15:35.394 position:50% align:center
Could that mean...

00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:36.687 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Brilliant! That's right!

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:37.688 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:39.064 position:50% align:center
You solved it.

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:41.275 position:50% align:center
If we sing and dance on
this stage for the monsters,

00:15:41.358 --> 00:15:43.694 position:50% align:center
the next path will open
when they're satisfied.

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:46.905 position:50% align:center
I mean I've seen it
in other dungeons.

00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:49.700 position:50% align:center
So, it wouldn't hurt to try it.

00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:52.327 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] This was a
questionable creation.

00:15:52.411 --> 00:15:54.246 position:50% align:center
It was during the time
when <i>Cross Reverie</i>

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:56.665 position:50% align:center
was doing a collab
with an idol game.

00:15:56.748 --> 00:16:00.002 position:50% align:center
I figured it might be a fun
contribution to the project.

00:16:01.003 --> 00:16:03.297 position:50% align:center
[REM] Whoever built this
needs a punch in the face.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:07.050 position:50% align:center
They're clearly very intelligent
with a huge god-complex.

00:16:07.134 --> 00:16:09.303 position:50% align:center
But they have the
creativity of a toddler.

[DIABLO gasps]

00:16:10.262 --> 00:16:11.972 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding? This is fun!

00:16:12.055 --> 00:16:12.931 position:50% align:center
I love to sing and dance!

00:16:13.015 --> 00:16:14.474 position:50% align:center
I agree, Shera.

00:16:14.558 --> 00:16:16.643 position:50% align:center
And it looks like we can keep
our clothes on for this one!

00:16:16.727 --> 00:16:19.104 position:50% align:center
[HORN] You're kidding, right?
Look out there!

00:16:19.188 --> 00:16:21.190 position:50% align:center
Those White Jagers
are incredibly strong!

00:16:21.273 --> 00:16:23.901 position:50% align:center
So, I wouldn't chill yet.

00:16:23.984 --> 00:16:25.777 position:50% align:center
If we fail to entertain
with our performance,

00:16:25.861 --> 00:16:28.363 position:50% align:center
they'll attack us
and rip us to shreds!

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:33.744 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Listen up! If you wanna
to get past this floor alive,

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:38.624 position:50% align:center
then as of this moment,
you must call me "Producer"!

00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:42.127 position:50% align:center
Um, are you changing careers?

00:16:42.211 --> 00:16:44.796 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Right. It's time for rehearsal!

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.924 position:50% align:center
One, two, one, two.

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:49.510 position:50% align:center
Step, jump, step, kick.

00:16:49.593 --> 00:16:50.594 position:50% align:center
I need more!

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:52.221 position:50% align:center
One, two, one, two.

00:16:52.304 --> 00:16:54.765 position:50% align:center
Step, jump, step, kick.

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:55.891 position:50% align:center
Bigger smiles!

00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:58.143 position:50% align:center
One, two. Step, jump.

00:16:58.227 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center
Up tempo!

00:16:59.478 --> 00:17:01.980 position:50% align:center
One, two, step, jump,
one, two, step, jump,

00:17:02.064 --> 00:17:04.107 position:50% align:center
one, two, step, jump, one!

[ALL panting]

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:11.073 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] That was a difficult
lesson to endure.

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
Monsters or not,
performing is hard,

00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:16.620 position:50% align:center
but I think the monsters
will enjoy your show!

We managed to get through
the whole thing alive.

[panting] Oh, uh. Right.

00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center
Figures you'd be into this, Elf.

00:19:31.672 --> 00:19:33.590 position:50% align:center
Singing, and dancing,
and making no sense.

00:19:33.674 --> 00:19:36.718 position:50% align:center
[SHERA giggles]
I had so much fun, didn't you?

00:19:36.802 --> 00:19:38.011 position:50% align:center
Yes, I did.

00:19:38.095 --> 00:19:40.055 position:50% align:center
It was the most fun
I've ever had in my life.

00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:42.683 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Me, too. No regrets.

[WHITE JAGERS]
Core! Core!

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:47.145 position:50% align:center
Do you hear that?

00:19:47.229 --> 00:19:49.273 position:50% align:center
Does this mean the Jagers
weren't satisfied?

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Will we have to fight them?

Encore! Encore! Encore!

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.782 position:50% align:center
Encore! Encore!

00:19:58.866 --> 00:20:00.659 position:50% align:center
Never mind.
They want an encore.

00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:01.952 position:50% align:center
Shall we do it again?

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:03.328 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:20:03.412 --> 00:20:04.538 position:50% align:center
We shall not!

[MONSTER BIRD 4A screeches]

[REM gasps]
Look to your left!

00:20:10.294 --> 00:20:11.461 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

Lightning Arrow!

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center
This is not where
we wanna be, guys!

00:20:24.016 --> 00:20:25.684 position:50% align:center
The monsters may be awful!

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:28.645 position:50% align:center
But if anyone of us
trips and falls, that's it!

00:20:28.729 --> 00:20:32.399 position:50% align:center
Instant death!

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:34.401 position:50% align:center
This seems to be
the only open path.

[SHERA]
Then we gotta keep going!

00:20:35.903 --> 00:20:37.613 position:50% align:center
Okay. Right.

00:20:38.572 --> 00:20:39.698 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
The strength of the monsters

00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
and their attack patterns

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.286 position:50% align:center
are still exactly as I set them,
so they're pretty easy.

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:46.038 position:50% align:center
It's the fall I'm worried about!

00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:48.707 position:50% align:center
There's no way I'd survive it!

No one mentioned
Summoners to me!

There are Summoners, Rem.

Explosion, go!

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:10.646 position:50% align:center
Who would even do that?

A Trap Worm? For the love!

00:21:20.531 --> 00:21:22.449 position:50% align:center
Lumachina, be on guard.

00:21:22.533 --> 00:21:24.117 position:50% align:center
Um. Okay.

It's you!

It's been a long while.

Good to see me, isn't it?

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:39.216 position:50% align:center
Or is it awkward considering
you abandoned me last time?

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:43.220 position:50% align:center
The damage you caused
to my skin is irreversible.

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:44.763 position:50% align:center
I try, though.

00:21:44.847 --> 00:21:47.975 position:50% align:center
My guess is you have no idea
how expensive skin care can be.

00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:51.603 position:50% align:center
And because of that,
you must die!

I don't like this ending!

Oh no! Not Horn!

[DIABLO] I see. You're what
they call "uncharted land."

[ROSE] I don't really
know anything else.

There are so many!
