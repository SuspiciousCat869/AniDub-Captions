00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:15.390 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA]
Yes, the Paladin Brigade.

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:18.310 position:50% align:center
It's a group of adventures
I organized who are strong

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:21.480 position:50% align:center
and capable enough of
protecting our local priests.

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:24.316 position:50% align:center
But I agree with you.
Due to my own failings,

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.735 position:50% align:center
the violence they produce
has increased.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
So then. Do I have your word?
You'll correct their behavior?

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:32.824 position:50% align:center
Yes. Of course.

00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:35.869 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Another thing, I'm worried that

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:38.413 position:50% align:center
this city is plagued
with Death Knell Disease.

00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:40.916 position:50% align:center
I'm aware of
this terrifying illness.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:44.962 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] Illness? Don't tell
me you believe those lies.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.839 position:50% align:center
What lies would those be?

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:49.967 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] The idea that
it's some sort of contagion.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.177 position:50% align:center
It's a curse, isn't it?

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.972 position:50% align:center
I don't think I'm following.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.515 position:50% align:center
I just found out.

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:59.685 position:50% align:center
As I prayed for that poor child
on the street to be healed.

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:02.062 position:50% align:center
God responded and
I heard His voice.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:05.023 position:50% align:center
He explained that someone
is casting a large-scale curse

00:01:05.107 --> 00:01:08.151 position:50% align:center
to threaten the lives of
citizens living in this city.

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:09.695 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA]
Hm?

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:12.281 position:50% align:center
Does that sound familiar to you?

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:16.952 position:50% align:center
Huh. Goodness,
I'm surprised you noticed.

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:19.121 position:50% align:center
What is that supposed to mean?

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:20.664 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.751 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
I don't feel well.

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:26.545 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:32.718 position:50% align:center
Lumachina? Can you hear me?

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:34.636 position:50% align:center
I knew you were shady!

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:41.810 position:50% align:center
What the? You suck.

00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:47.107 position:50% align:center
Good, Those sleeping aides
took far too long to kick in.

00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:50.319 position:50% align:center
What a waste of
precious time! Shiliu!

00:01:51.195 --> 00:01:52.362 position:50% align:center
[SHILIU]
Yes, sir?

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:30.210 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] There we go.
Almost done. Right there.

00:03:30.294 --> 00:03:33.130 position:50% align:center
And that should do it!
What did you think?

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.840 position:50% align:center
I guess I enjoyed it.

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:35.757 position:50% align:center
[clattering]

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:39.261 position:50% align:center
Who goes there?

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:43.432 position:50% align:center
Please put that thing away!
Don't you remember me, mister?

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.893 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's you.

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:47.895 position:50% align:center
Is this what
adventurers here do?

00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:50.189 position:50% align:center
Break into other people's
homes for pleasure?

00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:52.774 position:50% align:center
[HORN] Wha? I came here
because I wanted to see you!

00:03:52.858 --> 00:03:55.277 position:50% align:center
Your mouth. There's brown
stuff all over it.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.530 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I found leftover
curry in the kitchen.

00:03:58.614 --> 00:04:01.366 position:50% align:center
So what? You're not
the face police!

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.623 position:50% align:center
Diablo, look at this!

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:10.083 position:50% align:center
See? Next time
you should listen to me!

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:12.085 position:50% align:center
I told you Batutta would
take your friends away

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:13.712 position:50% align:center
and he did, didn't he?

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:14.922 position:50% align:center
What do we do now?

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.132 position:50% align:center
I guess we shouldn't
have trusted him.

00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:20.093 position:50% align:center
I didn't think he would
make a move so quickly.

00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:21.345 position:50% align:center
We're not ready.

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.931 position:50% align:center
We still need time to
recover ourselves, too.

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:25.224 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Recover from what?

00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:27.601 position:50% align:center
Death Knell Disease.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:30.187 position:50% align:center
It is a curse. A powerful one.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:31.897 --> 00:04:33.899 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] And by "curse,"
I mean a limited-time event

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:37.402 position:50% align:center
in <i>Cross Reverie</i> ,
but I'll keep that to myself.

00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:39.446 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
The most important task now is

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.032 position:50% align:center
bring Rem and Lumachina back.

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:44.660 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Let's go!

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:46.119 position:50% align:center
--[SHERA] Yay!
--[HORN] Right!

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.583 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
Uh, hello?

00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:58.632 position:50% align:center
So, you're finally awake.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.634 position:50% align:center
[REM gasps]
What is going on?

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:04.346 position:50% align:center
I don't know. When I woke up,
I was here, too.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:11.270 position:50% align:center
[REM] We appear to be
underground somewhere.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.647 position:50% align:center
And in a demented nightmare.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.274 position:50% align:center
Hey, Rem?

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.651 position:50% align:center
Do you know
who those people are?

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.987 position:50% align:center
I can't make out
what they're doing.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:26.076 position:50% align:center
[PEOPLE moaning]

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.246 position:50% align:center
[REM] Yarn-balls and
catnip! Yarn-balls...

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.164 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:05:31.248 --> 00:05:35.711 position:50% align:center
Uh, it's called "filth."
Having relations and whatnots.

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by "whatnots"?

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
Oh boy.

00:05:39.298 --> 00:05:41.925 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA] Greetings, ladies.
Quite an honor to be

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.636 position:50% align:center
on the altar for our ritual,
don't you think?

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.637 position:50% align:center
Did mommy hurt you?

00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
What honor are you
talking about?

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:51.435 position:50% align:center
This place is filled
with evil! Look around!

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:52.895 position:50% align:center
I've never seen
a more repulsive al--

00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:58.233 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA] Exactly. What we have
here is mass corruption.

00:05:58.317 --> 00:06:00.861 position:50% align:center
Ya know, we can talk
without the theatrics.

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center
Show them.

00:06:02.613 --> 00:06:04.114 position:50% align:center
[SHILIU]
My pleasure.

00:06:04.198 --> 00:06:05.657 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA]
Stunning, right?

00:06:05.741 --> 00:06:08.702 position:50% align:center
That's the concentrate that
causes the Death Knell Disease.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:09.995 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA] This concentrate
can only be produced

00:06:11.747 --> 00:06:13.123 position:50% align:center
from the essence of sin.

00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
It's literally the
source of evil itself.

00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:19.254 position:50% align:center
How do we obtain such
an essence one might ask?

00:06:19.338 --> 00:06:22.466 position:50% align:center
Heh. They're like beasts,
aren't they?

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:26.178 position:50% align:center
Hard to imagine they were
all once devout believers.

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:28.597 position:50% align:center
Not long ago
their faith was strong.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.893 position:50% align:center
Virtuous men and chaste women
with a passion for justice.

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:35.562 position:50% align:center
All it takes is a little push
while they're straddling

00:06:35.646 --> 00:06:38.774 position:50% align:center
their darkest desires
to make humans fall!

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:41.401 position:50% align:center
Fornication,
bloodshed, gluttony.

00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:45.072 position:50% align:center
When a person gives in,
the essence of evil is created!

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:48.825 position:50% align:center
Ew. So we're literally hanging
out in your mancave of smut?

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:52.621 position:50% align:center
Batutta. That's just wrong.

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:54.790 position:50% align:center
God, where are you?

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.792 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA] My research
has shown that those who can

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:59.002 position:50% align:center
perform powerful
miracles will produce

00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:01.922 position:50% align:center
a richer evil essence
when they fall.

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.674 position:50% align:center
Meaning the purest
souls will produce

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:06.051 position:50% align:center
the strongest concentrate.

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:10.055 position:50% align:center
But how could you inflict the
Death Knell Disease on so many?

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:15.102 position:50% align:center
So many? You misunderstand.
I'm targeting but one person.

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:18.689 position:50% align:center
The lovely Laminitus
is my conquest.

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.275 position:50% align:center
So, tie her to this thing.

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:24.570 position:50% align:center
All I've heard about you
is what a noble man you are.

00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:27.906 position:50% align:center
Why would you commit
such a colossal sin?

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.534 position:50% align:center
What happened to your heart?

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.911 position:50% align:center
Besides my family
being murdered?

00:07:32.995 --> 00:07:35.205 position:50% align:center
Or being betrayed
by my best friend?

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
Or being threatened by Fallen?

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA] Would those be
enough reasons for you?

00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:46.258 position:50% align:center
You might even empathize
with my choices given my past.

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:48.093 position:50% align:center
There's no true reason, though--

00:07:48.177 --> 00:07:50.762 position:50% align:center
people are just greedy
and sinful by nature.

00:07:50.846 --> 00:07:51.972 position:50% align:center
But not you.

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:54.224 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm looking forward to this.

00:07:54.308 --> 00:07:55.934 position:50% align:center
It's not every day
one gets to watch

00:07:56.018 --> 00:08:00.105 position:50% align:center
the highest member of the Church
give in to lustful desires.

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:03.483 position:50% align:center
Shiliu, I'll leave
the rest to you.

00:08:03.567 --> 00:08:06.612 position:50% align:center
Your wish is my
ultimate pleasure, Master.

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:08.447 position:50% align:center
At least you got me
a cute one this time.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.201 position:50% align:center
I love this "pious princess"
look. [chuckles]

00:08:12.284 --> 00:08:13.827 position:50% align:center
This won't hurt. I promise.

00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:16.788 position:50% align:center
In fact, you'll be
begging for more.

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:21.793 position:50% align:center
[SHILIU]
I'ma lick you all over!

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.049 position:50% align:center
[SHILIU]
The ultimate tongue bath!

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:28.425 position:50% align:center
[SHILIU laughs]

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:30.385 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Stop!

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:36.683 position:50% align:center
Stop! I get it!

00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:38.644 position:50% align:center
[explosion]

00:08:49.613 --> 00:08:51.073 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:54.117 position:50% align:center
Look! It's Rem and Lumachina!
They're tied up!

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:55.786 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.497 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] 'Kay, so, in the game,
this place was where

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.500 position:50% align:center
the Death Knell Disease's
event boss would show up.

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:05.379 position:50% align:center
Hmm. What are all those
shadows around us?

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:07.965 position:50% align:center
Whoa? What the French toast?

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.384 position:50% align:center
Since when does <i>Cross</i>
<i>Reverie</i> develop plots

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:12.469 position:50% align:center
based on frat boy
spank bank material?

00:09:12.553 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA]
I knew you'd show up.

00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:15.973 position:50% align:center
Diablo, was it?

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:19.434 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed you were
able to find us.

00:09:19.518 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
Thanks for making it easy.

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center
I suppose I should
thank your minions as well.

00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:26.066 position:50% align:center
The Paladin Brigade was helpful.

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:29.653 position:50% align:center
They answered every
single question I asked.

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:34.533 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Now that I'm here,
I have to know,

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:36.118 position:50% align:center
what is this place?

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:38.495 position:50% align:center
If you're a first-rate sorcerer,
then you should be able to tell.

00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:39.705 position:50% align:center
You don't need me.

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:41.123 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:43.292 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I'm a first rate
shut-in gamer, bro.

00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:45.460 position:50% align:center
I might need
a little assistance here.

00:09:45.544 --> 00:09:47.462 position:50% align:center
I know of the curse
you're wielding.

00:09:47.546 --> 00:09:49.047 position:50% align:center
The Death Knell Disease.

00:09:49.131 --> 00:09:52.843 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA] Oh? You must've
heard about it from Lumachina.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:55.804 position:50% align:center
Ah, you're saying
she noticed it, too?

00:09:55.888 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
You didn't hear of it from her?

00:09:57.723 --> 00:09:59.600 position:50% align:center
A Demon Lord needs no mortals!

00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:01.018 position:50% align:center
I am Diablo!

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.519 position:50% align:center
From another world!

00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:04.855 position:50% align:center
Do you know how silly you sound?

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:06.190 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Yeah, I think everyone's

00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:08.150 position:50% align:center
kinda over that by now.

00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
Except Rem and Shera, of course.

00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:12.863 position:50% align:center
They fall for all of it.

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.781 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Admit it.

00:10:14.865 --> 00:10:16.700 position:50% align:center
You learned about the
Death Knell Disease curse

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:18.327 position:50% align:center
from the Fallen, didn't you?

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.704 position:50% align:center
What? How did you know?

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.582 position:50% align:center
Big ole duh! The only ones
who ever used that curse

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:24.875 position:50% align:center
in the game were the Fallen,

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.627 position:50% align:center
so where else would
you have learned it?

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.632 position:50% align:center
I told you I'm a Demon Lord.
Now, release those two.

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:34.593 position:50% align:center
Heh. Quite amusing,
and you seem to be

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:38.305 position:50% align:center
unreasonably strong, but I
question what kind of magic

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.933 position:50% align:center
you can even use here?

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
How are your skills when it
comes to fighting on stairs, hm?

00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:47.189 position:50% align:center
I doubt your ability to
defeat me on these steps.

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:51.944 position:50% align:center
You're the one who will
struggle to defeat me, period.

00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:53.820 position:50% align:center
Explosion!

00:10:59.493 --> 00:11:00.827 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hell yeah!

00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:01.995 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.500 position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:11:12.214 --> 00:11:13.131 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA]
Well, that wasn't

00:11:13.215 --> 00:11:15.384 position:50% align:center
a very smart place
to land, was it?

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:17.511 position:50% align:center
If the blast from your
attack causes the walls

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:21.640 position:50% align:center
or ceiling to collapse,
that could be deadly for you.

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.350 position:50% align:center
And what would happen
to your little friends?

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:25.769 position:50% align:center
How dare you.

00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:27.980 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] He's right,
these walls aren't strong.

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:29.523 position:50% align:center
I have to be carefull.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.567 position:50% align:center
Even though he's zipping around
like a poop throwing monkey.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.194 position:50% align:center
How'd he dodge
my attack so quickly?

00:11:34.278 --> 00:11:35.612 position:50% align:center
I can keep up with that speed,

00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:38.699 position:50% align:center
I just need a spell
with a wider range.

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:42.411 position:50% align:center
If you're not gonna attack,
then I'm gonna come for you!

00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:45.664 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I don't know
what level of magic to use!

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:50.043 position:50% align:center
Heh. You can't
hesitate here! Green horn!

00:11:50.127 --> 00:11:51.628 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
He's fast!

00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:00.053 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO groans]

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.265 position:50% align:center
No! Diablo, come back!

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:06.852 position:50% align:center
Hmph. All right, I'm impressed.
You've got skills.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:08.520 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA]
It's sad.

00:12:08.604 --> 00:12:09.813 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA chuckles]

00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:12.399 position:50% align:center
You waltzed in so confident
in your abilities.

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
You failed to realize that you
can't fully use your magic here.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:17.988 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're
proud of yourself

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.240 position:50% align:center
for nailing down
my secret location.

00:12:20.324 --> 00:12:23.243 position:50% align:center
But it was always a trap to
get you right where I need you.

00:12:23.327 --> 00:12:25.829 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Owie, owie.
Shit! I hate him so much!

00:12:25.913 --> 00:12:28.207 position:50% align:center
Heh. You underestimate me.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.584 position:50% align:center
Should I turn it up?
I can do that!

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.669 position:50% align:center
Sphere of Lightning!

00:12:34.296 --> 00:12:36.590 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] This spell only affects
the intended target.

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:39.718 position:50% align:center
It's not gonna blast walls
or surroundings.

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:43.514 position:50% align:center
Bring it, Batutta, you're not
getting outta this one.

00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:45.349 position:50% align:center
Especially since we've
got the Ground Mine

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:48.227 position:50% align:center
backups on the wall
to finish you off.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.564 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] What's wrong?
Why isn't he attacking?

00:12:52.648 --> 00:12:55.859 position:50% align:center
It's too easy.
I know what you're after.

00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:58.820 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO gasps]

00:13:07.538 --> 00:13:09.665 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
He's in my face!

00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
You lost. Try again!

00:13:13.377 --> 00:13:15.504 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Is that the Rising Spear?

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:18.131 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA grunts]

00:13:18.215 --> 00:13:21.009 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Aw crap! I can't dodge!

00:13:21.093 --> 00:13:22.386 position:50% align:center
Fine, then!

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:34.064 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Did I get stabbed?
In the freakin' heart? So lame.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:36.692 position:50% align:center
Oh no. Blood.

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:40.279 position:50% align:center
Diablo!

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:42.406 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
I'm gonna die.

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:50.247 position:50% align:center
I win. You lose.

00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:56.712 position:50% align:center
My preparation
is always flawless

00:13:56.795 --> 00:13:59.339 position:50% align:center
so that I may strategically
lure in my enemies.

00:13:59.423 --> 00:14:02.176 position:50% align:center
This ensures I defeat them
from a stronger position!

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:03.844 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:06.722 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Diablo! Diablo!

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:09.141 position:50% align:center
Hey! I'm here.

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:13.645 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA laughing]

00:14:13.729 --> 00:14:15.355 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:14:15.439 --> 00:14:16.815 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Gotcha.

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center
Wait. How are you alive?

00:14:21.153 --> 00:14:23.989 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO chuckles]
This spell can't be used

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:26.325 position:50% align:center
without touching the target.

00:14:26.408 --> 00:14:28.285 position:50% align:center
Looks like you messed up.

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:29.828 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA gasps]

00:14:29.912 --> 00:14:32.206 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Absolute Zero!

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:36.293 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] I think you'll make
a great ice sculpture!

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:42.257 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA screams]

00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:45.636 position:50% align:center
[gasps, yells]

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:50.140 position:50% align:center
You idiot.

00:14:50.224 --> 00:14:51.642 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:54.853 position:50% align:center
Losing your arm and weapon
wasn't part of your strategy?

00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:57.314 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Aw, damn!

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:59.441 position:50% align:center
It seriously feels like
I'm about to die!

00:14:59.525 --> 00:15:02.236 position:50% align:center
If no one was around, I'd be
screaming like a sick goat!

00:15:02.319 --> 00:15:04.905 position:50% align:center
The cape I wear is called
the Curtain of Dark Clouds.

00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:06.657 position:50% align:center
It allows me to
survive any attack

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.201 position:50% align:center
with just one
hit point remaining.

00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:11.703 position:50% align:center
I never thought there'd come a
time when I'd actually need it.

00:15:11.787 --> 00:15:13.705 position:50% align:center
Looks like my Distorted
Crown's auto-recovery

00:15:13.789 --> 00:15:15.040 position:50% align:center
has been activated, too.

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:16.083 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA]
What is this?

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:17.751 position:50% align:center
Are you telling me
you're immortal?

00:15:17.835 --> 00:15:18.877 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:21.547 position:50% align:center
Impossible! Shiliu!

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.715 position:50% align:center
[SHILIU]
I'm ready for you, Master.

00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:27.594 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA gasps]

00:15:27.678 --> 00:15:28.971 position:50% align:center
[SHILIU]
Congratulations.

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:32.182 position:50% align:center
Looks like your strategy
has triumphed after all.

00:15:32.266 --> 00:15:33.308 position:50% align:center
Rem, no!

00:15:33.392 --> 00:15:35.602 position:50% align:center
Don't stop! You have to
keep fighting!

00:15:35.686 --> 00:15:37.354 position:50% align:center
I'll wait for you right here!

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:38.522 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA chuckles]

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:42.526 position:50% align:center
Think that's funny?
I'll kill you!

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:44.111 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Yeah right. How?

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:45.320 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO gasps]

00:15:46.655 --> 00:15:47.948 position:50% align:center
[SHILIU groans]

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
Check it out!
This Angel Shot really works!

00:15:55.414 --> 00:15:57.541 position:50% align:center
Great job! Way to go, Shera!

00:15:57.624 --> 00:16:02.337 position:50% align:center
[SHILIU groans]

00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:10.387 position:50% align:center
[SHERA gasps]
She really turned to stone?

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.724 position:50% align:center
What? It must be an effect
of Klem's magic power!

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:17.686 position:50% align:center
Oh no, is it?
That could be terrifying.

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:19.521 position:50% align:center
Hey, um, Shiliu?

00:16:19.605 --> 00:16:20.439 position:50% align:center
That was hot!

00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:21.773 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Did they hurt you?

00:16:21.857 --> 00:16:23.400 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Why're you here?

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:27.487 position:50% align:center
[giggles] I wanted to
prove myself to that guy.

00:16:27.571 --> 00:16:30.157 position:50% align:center
I want him to know
I can be useful, too!

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.617 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
"That guy"?

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.246 position:50% align:center
So, what's your plan, Batutta?

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.376 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] That works.
We managed to win somehow.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.796 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA chuckles]
I hope every one of you's

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.382 position:50% align:center
prepared to drown
in a sea of despair.

00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:48.634 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Uh, what?

00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:50.719 position:50% align:center
I regret that I won't be
able to watch your faces

00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:54.598 position:50% align:center
fill with grief!
It breaks my heart!

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:56.433 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Is he still wanting to fight?

00:16:56.517 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA grunts]
Activate Shining Blow!

00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:05.859 position:50% align:center
Darkness Cannon!

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:16.286 position:50% align:center
[BOTH yelling]

00:17:18.497 --> 00:17:20.999 position:50% align:center
Diablo!

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:25.796 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
It's no use!

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:31.176 position:50% align:center
I'm a Demon Lord
from another world, Diablo!

00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:46.608 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Diablo!

00:17:47.818 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Shera? What are you
doing down here?

00:17:50.571 --> 00:17:51.947 position:50% align:center
This place is about to collapse!

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.325 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's why we have to
get out of here fast!

00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
Let's grab the others!

00:18:00.581 --> 00:18:02.833 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] She could have
escaped by herself.

00:18:05.127 --> 00:18:06.420 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Sheesh.

00:18:08.422 --> 00:18:09.631 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:15.304 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Hold on tight, okay?

00:18:15.387 --> 00:18:16.847 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.475 position:50% align:center
[SHERA screams]

00:18:25.731 --> 00:18:28.859 position:50% align:center
[groans] Who are you?
What's your problem?

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:29.985 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS]
I hope you'll forgive me

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:32.070 position:50% align:center
for interrupting your bath.

00:18:32.154 --> 00:18:34.281 position:50% align:center
My name is Varakness,
and I've been appointed as

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
the Grand General of
the Demon Lord's Army.

00:18:37.618 --> 00:18:39.077 position:50% align:center
The Demon Lord has...

00:18:39.161 --> 00:18:41.371 position:50% align:center
I mean, His Majesty
has finally awakened,

00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
and I've come here today
to advise you to surrender.

00:18:44.583 --> 00:18:46.043 position:50% align:center
Surrender to what?

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:49.004 position:50% align:center
Is the Demon Lord planning
to rule over this city?

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:50.881 position:50% align:center
Yes, and trust his
rules will be merciful

00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:52.841 position:50% align:center
and fair, as is His Lordship.

00:18:52.925 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:54.468 --> 00:18:55.427 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS]
He's decided to have

00:18:55.511 --> 00:18:58.347 position:50% align:center
all the mortal races
commit suicide.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.224 position:50% align:center
That's far more merciful
than allowing them

00:19:00.307 --> 00:19:03.060 position:50% align:center
to be devoured alive
by a bevy of monsters.

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:04.895 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:10.359 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS] Fascinating.
But you're an idiot!

00:19:10.442 --> 00:19:14.780 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS laughs]
Be still, my cold heart!

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:18.825 position:50% align:center
You have no idea how much I
adore strong, feisty women.

00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:20.994 position:50% align:center
Don't toy with me!

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:26.959 position:50% align:center
[VARAKNESS chuckles]
Sweet Fanis Laminitus.

00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:28.752 position:50% align:center
I have no interest
in killing you.

00:19:28.836 --> 00:19:29.920 position:50% align:center
Quite the opposite!

00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:32.005 position:50% align:center
I'd love for you
to join my harem!

00:19:32.089 --> 00:19:33.632 position:50% align:center
You did not just say that.

00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.342 position:50% align:center
You have time,
I'll be by to collect you

00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:37.135 position:50% align:center
the night of the next full moon.

00:19:37.219 --> 00:19:38.512 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward to seeing

00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:42.891 position:50% align:center
the wedding dress you pick out,
Dear Fanis. [chuckles]

00:19:42.975 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS]
Quit saying my name in a tone

00:19:44.518 --> 00:19:46.103 position:50% align:center
that suggests you know me.

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
Gross me out!

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.484 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS] The night of
the next full moon.

00:19:52.568 --> 00:19:53.819 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS gasps]

00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:57.531 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS]
Huh?

00:19:57.614 --> 00:19:58.949 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
It's floating.

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:01.660 position:50% align:center
Oh my goodness,
we're really floating!

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:03.704 position:50% align:center
Yeah we are!
Thanks for the save!

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:05.289 position:50% align:center
One day I'll quit
expecting you to fail

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:08.292 position:50% align:center
and be more
comfortably apathetic.

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
Wow! I feel like we barely
made it out of that one!

00:20:12.296 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
You're not wrong.

00:20:13.547 --> 00:20:15.215 position:50% align:center
Do something!

00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:17.509 position:50% align:center
What can he do?

00:20:17.593 --> 00:20:19.595 position:50% align:center
Just stay close to me!

00:20:20.554 --> 00:20:21.972 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:20:23.015 --> 00:20:26.518 position:50% align:center
When I tell you to change
positions you do as I command!

00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:34.610 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Adzet! Rise!

00:20:40.199 --> 00:20:41.867 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I'm still processing
how close that was.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.327 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Lumachina?

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.747 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] Hey! Can you hear me?
Wake up! Please wake up!

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.292 position:50% align:center
You better not be faking!
I'll hate you forever.

00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:54.296 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] There! That's the
Death Knell Disease!

00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:55.756 position:50% align:center
[REM]
What? How'd she get that?

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:57.966 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
How contagious is it?

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.763 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA] I hope every
one of you's prepared

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:06.225 position:50% align:center
to drown in a sea of despair.

00:21:06.308 --> 00:21:07.684 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
He had already done it.

00:21:07.768 --> 00:21:09.853 position:50% align:center
He placed the curse
on Lumachina.

00:21:09.937 --> 00:21:11.730 position:50% align:center
Come on! Wake up!

00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:14.066 position:50% align:center
You know how you prayed for
that baby? Let's do it now!

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:15.567 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
That's impossible.

00:21:15.651 --> 00:21:19.696 position:50% align:center
The miracles. She can't
use them on herself.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.657 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,
the power of miracles

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.284 position:50% align:center
doesn't work on my own body.

00:21:24.368 --> 00:21:26.495 position:50% align:center
It can't be.

00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:29.373 position:50% align:center
Come on! You have to wake up!

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:32.209 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Please don't cry.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:34.419 position:50% align:center
It's meant to be.

00:21:34.503 --> 00:21:36.797 position:50% align:center
I promise. It's God's plan.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.674 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
You're right.

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:39.675 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:21:39.758 --> 00:21:41.552 position:50% align:center
Please don't. This is hard.

00:21:41.635 --> 00:21:44.805 position:50% align:center
She's not dying yet, calm down!

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:48.267 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
I feel so tired.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.643 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Didn't you make the journey here

00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:52.646 position:50% align:center
to battle corruption within
the Church by yourself?

00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:55.232 position:50% align:center
I know you've got
some strength, so use it!

00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:57.568 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare surrender
to some curse!

00:21:57.651 --> 00:21:59.361 position:50% align:center
I'll lend you my power!

00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:01.321 position:50% align:center
But you have to
get up and fight this!

00:22:01.405 --> 00:22:03.907 position:50% align:center
[SHERA, REM gasp]

00:22:03.991 --> 00:22:07.578 position:50% align:center
Um. Right. I will!

00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:09.580 position:50% align:center
I'll refuse to give into curses!

00:22:09.663 --> 00:22:11.582 position:50% align:center
Put a little faith in me.

00:22:11.665 --> 00:22:12.958 position:50% align:center
Rabbit Ears!

00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:15.002 position:50% align:center
Make yourself useful and
lead us to a new dungeon!

00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:17.838 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Okay! Yes!

00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:20.215 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] If I'm right,
the protective charm I won

00:22:20.299 --> 00:22:23.844 position:50% align:center
by clearing events should be
somewhere in that dungeon.

00:22:23.927 --> 00:22:25.929 position:50% align:center
That's where we'll
find the item!

00:22:26.013 --> 00:22:27.806 position:50% align:center
We're going to heal Lumachina

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.893 position:50% align:center
and then defeat the
Death Knell Disease!

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.280 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I never thought I'd be
taking on my own dungeon.

00:24:06.363 --> 00:24:08.073 position:50% align:center
[HORN] You're telling us
to dance on that stage?

00:24:08.156 --> 00:24:09.575 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Just die already!

00:24:09.658 --> 00:24:12.369 position:50% align:center
For the love of
all expensive cosmetics!
