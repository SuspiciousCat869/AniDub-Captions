[SHERA]
Wow! I can see it from here!

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:20.896 position:50% align:center
We're practically there, Rem!
Hey, you awake?

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.069 position:50% align:center
[SHERA gasps]
Gross!

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:28.654 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Next time
we should tranquilize her

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:29.780 position:50% align:center
and put her in a carrier.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:33.033 position:50% align:center
Uh, God? I mean, Sir Diablo.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.619 position:50% align:center
It looks like
we've arrived safely.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.038 position:50% align:center
Thank you for accompanying me.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.791 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Hmph. Please, do not mention it.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.710 position:50% align:center
I make these journeys
all the time.

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:44.753 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Yeah right.

00:00:44.837 --> 00:00:46.380 position:50% align:center
It took us two weeks
just to get here

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:49.049 position:50% align:center
because we got so stupidly lost.

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:53.470 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Not to mention the
storms we weren't prepared for!

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
Whatever. I'm over it.

00:00:57.683 --> 00:01:00.644 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
There's Zircon Tower City. Neat.

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:36.740 position:50% align:center
[SHERA groans]
I'm wasting away!

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.159 position:50% align:center
We have to find food
before I starve to death!

00:02:39.243 --> 00:02:40.494 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Grow up, please.

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:43.288 position:50% align:center
We're here to escort
Lumachina safely to Batutta.

00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:45.624 position:50% align:center
And trust me, your body's
got plenty to gnaw on.

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:47.042 position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:49.962 position:50% align:center
Why're you so loud?
I'm right here.

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:53.006 position:50% align:center
Anyway, this place is dead.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.426 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] Yeah, I don't
see many food options.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.680 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER 2A]
Please! Somebody! Heal my child!

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:01.598 position:50% align:center
I can't believe this heat.

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:03.600 position:50% align:center
[HORN]
Hi! Are you an adventurer?

00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:05.102 position:50% align:center
I might be.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.895 position:50% align:center
Well then you, sir,
must be dying

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:08.856 position:50% align:center
to take on a brand new dungeon?

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.483 position:50% align:center
What do you think?
I wouldn't suggest going alone.

00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:13.944 position:50% align:center
You'll need a dungeon
guide and lock picker.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.864 position:50% align:center
I happen to be both!
My name's Horn!

00:03:16.947 --> 00:03:19.575 position:50% align:center
'Kay. What kind of
dungeon is it?

00:03:19.658 --> 00:03:21.869 position:50% align:center
The moment you arrive,
it's incredible!

00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:23.787 position:50% align:center
There're lion statues
at the entrance,

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:25.664 position:50% align:center
and they attack you at the gate!

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:26.915 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Are you serious?

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:28.417 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.585 position:50% align:center
Tell me something.

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.545 position:50% align:center
Does this dungeon
have 13 floors?

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:34.047 position:50% align:center
Oh, no idea, unfortunately.

00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:36.550 position:50% align:center
No one's ever been able to
make it past the third floor.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:37.885 position:50% align:center
The third floor, huh?

00:03:37.968 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure
that's the one where

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:40.721 position:50% align:center
you have to defeat
the colored slimes,

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:41.889 position:50% align:center
and once that's done,

00:03:41.972 --> 00:03:43.390 position:50% align:center
the key to the fourth
floor will appear.

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:44.766 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.059 position:50% align:center
Because that would
explain why there were

00:03:46.143 --> 00:03:48.604 position:50% align:center
so many slimes
hanging around there.

00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:51.315 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
I knew it! It is my dungeon!

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:54.109 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Hey, what's your name?

00:03:54.193 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50% align:center
Me? I'm none other than--

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.865 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] This is terrible!
I cannot stand by silently!

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.326 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] What is she doing?
Besides ruining everything?

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.329 position:50% align:center
You're blatantly ignoring this
poor woman asking for help!

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.956 position:50% align:center
Do you really not care
that her baby's been hurt?

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.250 position:50% align:center
And uh, who are you?

00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:14.671 position:50% align:center
I'm begging, sir!
Please heal my child!

00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:17.508 position:50% align:center
If you're trying to tell me that
you need the help of a priest,

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:20.135 position:50% align:center
I suggest you get in line
and pay the donation!

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:23.514 position:50% align:center
That guy's bad news!
He's with the Paladin Brigade!

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
Oh, good for him.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.392 position:50% align:center
Question. What do you
mean by "Brigade"?

00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:28.727 position:50% align:center
They're soldiers
of the Church who

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
work under that
Paladin's command.

00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
Just stay out of their way.
They're violent.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:37.194 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] We came here
to seek Batutta's help.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
His minions are of no concern.

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
It's written in
the holy scripture

00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50% align:center
that all who seek aid shall--

00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:45.494 position:50% align:center
[PALADIN 2A]
Shut up! I can read, too!

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.538 position:50% align:center
That's not what I'm saying!

00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:49.706 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Amazing how many want her dead.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.959 position:50% align:center
All she wants to do
is help weak people.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.419 position:50% align:center
How was I supposed to know
she'd be such a headache?

00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:55.921 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
...we can repent.

00:04:57.756 --> 00:04:59.758 position:50% align:center
Fool! How dare you lecture me!

00:04:59.842 --> 00:05:03.220 position:50% align:center
You should never talk down to
members of the Paladin Brigade!

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.055 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.682 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO grunts]

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:18.986 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Hmph. He was begging for it.

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:20.237 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed!

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.823 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Serves him right!

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:24.992 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Hm? What's the matter?

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.952 position:50% align:center
Why does that infant
need healing?

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:30.706 position:50% align:center
Well. See. I found these marks.

00:05:33.584 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I've seen those.
They're in the game, too.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:39.715 position:50% align:center
Death Knell Disease!

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
What's that mean?

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.636 position:50% align:center
It's the name of an epidemic.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.308 position:50% align:center
Once nine of these markings
appear, then, he'll pass away!

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.185 position:50% align:center
So how do we make him better?

00:05:51.268 --> 00:05:53.729 position:50% align:center
We'd have to request
a miracle from a priest.

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
That's the only way I know.

00:05:55.731 --> 00:05:58.734 position:50% align:center
Okay. Then let's go
to the church.

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:00.277 position:50% align:center
It's no use.

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:05.073 position:50% align:center
[HORN] You have to pay.
They call it a donation.

00:06:05.157 --> 00:06:06.450 position:50% align:center
But even the minimum amount is

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.203 position:50% align:center
much too high
for many to afford.

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:10.704 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.624 position:50% align:center
How can they put a price on
this precious angel's life?

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:16.710 position:50% align:center
No clue. That's just
how it is here.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:17.836 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.176 position:50% align:center
[CHILD 2A crying]

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.136 position:50% align:center
I'll be the one to cure him.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.139 position:50% align:center
Huh? It's not something
anyone can do!

00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:32.017 position:50% align:center
God will protect me
in this venture.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.352 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right?

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.064 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
I wish she would get over that.

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:40.192 position:50% align:center
I believe in your abilities.

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:44.488 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Sir. Let's start.

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:47.574 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
I need everyone's help.

00:06:47.658 --> 00:06:50.369 position:50% align:center
We must all pray together.

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center
O, heavens, we turn to you.

00:06:53.372 --> 00:06:56.124 position:50% align:center
Please hear the voices
of your followers.

00:06:56.208 --> 00:06:58.418 position:50% align:center
We ask for salvation.

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Save this child from pain.

00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:06.635 position:50% align:center
From this foul disease.

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:14.309 position:50% align:center
Please grant him mercy.

00:07:14.393 --> 00:07:17.437 position:50% align:center
Forgive this child
for all his sins.

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:25.153 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Forgive him. Grant him mercy.

00:07:25.237 --> 00:07:26.905 position:50% align:center
Forgive him.

00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:32.953 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Grant him mercy. Forgive him.

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:36.957 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] The magical energy
in here is no joke.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.292 position:50% align:center

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.919 position:50% align:center

Amazing! I can't believe
I just watched you

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:06.195 position:50% align:center
heal that child with words!

00:08:06.278 --> 00:08:09.198 position:50% align:center
It's almost like
you're God or something!

00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:12.326 position:50% align:center
That kind of skill is expected.

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:13.911 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

[SHERA]
Who's making the ground shake?

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:18.874 position:50% align:center

Everyone take cover! Hurry!

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:31.428 position:50% align:center

So that's a Sand Whale?

00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
[HORN] It looks like that boat
is attempting to escape

00:08:51.365 --> 00:08:54.660 position:50% align:center
by directing the Sand Whale
back towards the city instead!

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
What a selfish blow hole.

00:08:56.245 --> 00:08:59.873 position:50% align:center
Oh no! I'm frightened!
Rescue me!

00:08:59.957 --> 00:09:03.126 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be rough if that
thing crashes into the city.

Can you not tell
how big that thing is?

[DIABLO] Nothing's too big
for the Demon Lord!

00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:23.814 position:50% align:center
No monster! Watch me!

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.441 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

00:09:26.525 --> 00:09:28.360 position:50% align:center
I've hardly ever used
this stupid magic!

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:31.780 position:50% align:center
Why can't I just pray and
chant like that church girl?

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:34.658 position:50% align:center
O shadows my friend,

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:37.077 position:50% align:center
born from night
darker than ebony.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.329 position:50% align:center
Gather and form an arc!

00:09:40.414 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
Dark Arc Seek!

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:51.175 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] O void that
swallows all of creation,

00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:53.594 position:50% align:center
come forth to my hand!

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:58.640 position:50% align:center
Black Hole Arrow!

00:10:04.855 --> 00:10:08.775 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Oh man. That thing's
practically a mountain!

00:10:08.859 --> 00:10:11.320 position:50% align:center
Is my magic even
gonna work on it?

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:13.822 position:50% align:center
I gotta stop putting
that negativity out!

00:10:13.906 --> 00:10:16.783 position:50% align:center
I'm a Demon Lord. I am Diablo!

00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:19.745 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] I'm a Demon Lord
from another world!

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:22.664 position:50% align:center
Arrow of void, drive a
stake into the boundary

00:10:22.748 --> 00:10:25.125 position:50% align:center
between Heaven and Earth!

00:10:25.209 --> 00:10:28.420 position:50% align:center
Gravity Abyss!

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:43.018 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Yes! Nailed it!

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.773 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] What that heck?
Why's it acting like that?

00:10:52.486 --> 00:10:55.322 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] There it is!
That's what I'm talkin' about!

00:11:00.202 --> 00:11:02.371 position:50% align:center
We're about to get
blown off our feet!

00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:04.873 position:50% align:center
Hey! Can someone
turn the magic down?

00:11:04.957 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
Is the monster gone yet?

00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:10.546 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Why are you still standing?

00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:13.423 position:50% align:center
I really hope this spell
lasts until it's gone.

00:11:13.507 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
Cause if not, I don't know if

00:11:16.093 --> 00:11:18.262 position:50% align:center
I have anything else
that'll work.

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:23.684 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA]
Seven Star Blast!

00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:28.021 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:11:28.105 --> 00:11:30.941 position:50% align:center
That was a long-range attack,
but who did it?

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:41.660 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Now what?

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:44.079 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on! A frikkin Magi-Gun?

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:46.290 position:50% align:center
Someone's a Magi-Gunner?

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:48.959 position:50% align:center
How'd they reach such
a high level already?

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
[SAND WHALE 2A roars]

00:12:01.722 --> 00:12:04.474 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Okay,
I think we're safe.

00:12:04.558 --> 00:12:05.976 position:50% align:center
You did it, Diablo!

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.895 position:50% align:center
Yeah, good job.

00:12:07.978 --> 00:12:09.646 position:50% align:center
No, really. I'm proud of you.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.190 position:50% align:center
See, they're real tears.

00:12:11.273 --> 00:12:13.025 position:50% align:center
Thank you! You are the best!

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:14.860 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Wha? All I heard was breast!

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:17.154 position:50% align:center
I don't get why she does this,
but I'm here for it!

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.488 position:50% align:center
No I'm not!

00:12:18.572 --> 00:12:20.240 position:50% align:center
I'm a Demon Lord, dammit,
and this is below me!

00:12:20.324 --> 00:12:21.992 position:50% align:center
The best!

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:25.495 position:50% align:center
Stop. Please keep those
things to yourself.

00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:27.664 position:50% align:center
Wow. You saved us.

00:12:27.748 --> 00:12:29.208 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA]
There he is.

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:33.337 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA]
Are you the one who fired that

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.340 position:50% align:center
magic spell at
the monster's snout?

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] This guy's
pretty strong. I can tell.

00:12:42.638 --> 00:12:44.181 position:50% align:center
[PALADIN 2A]
Boss! That's him!

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:46.808 position:50% align:center
You're looking at the Demon guy
who defied the Church!

00:12:46.892 --> 00:12:49.228 position:50% align:center
Huh. Hey. You know who this is?

00:12:49.311 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
Name's Batutta. He's known
as the Head Paladin.

00:12:51.522 --> 00:12:53.190 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:54.650 position:50% align:center
So that's Batutta then?

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:57.027 position:50% align:center
Things are not good right now.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.278 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Of course he is.

00:12:58.362 --> 00:13:00.364 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
I didn't think of that.

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:03.617 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't the Head Paladin be
the boss of a herd of bandits?

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
Indeed, it was my magic.

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:09.248 position:50% align:center
And you, you're the one who
unleashed the Martial Art?

00:13:09.331 --> 00:13:13.252 position:50% align:center
Indeed. That's what I call
my Seven Star Blast.

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:14.711 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:17.172 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
That's a Level 130 Martial Art!

00:13:17.256 --> 00:13:19.550 position:50% align:center
Tell me. What is
the Paladin Brigade

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:22.052 position:50% align:center
these people claim to belong to?

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:26.139 position:50% align:center
I never gave my permission
to form that sort of group!

00:13:26.223 --> 00:13:28.016 position:50% align:center
Did the Cardinals allow it?

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.103 position:50% align:center
Or did you create it
without approval?

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:32.354 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA]
So it's you.

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:35.148 position:50% align:center
Hey, lady! Watch your mouth!

00:13:35.232 --> 00:13:38.902 position:50% align:center
Yo, boss. Let's show
these dopes how to act

00:13:38.986 --> 00:13:43.031 position:50% align:center
in front of the
head Paladin. [chuckles]

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.039 position:50% align:center
[PALADINS gasp]

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:55.419 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA] Forgive me,
I wasn't expecting you,

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:57.087 position:50% align:center
Head Priest Lumachina.

00:13:57.171 --> 00:13:59.173 position:50% align:center
I've only met you
one other time in my life

00:13:59.256 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
when you were little.

00:14:01.592 --> 00:14:04.469 position:50% align:center
But there's no doubt
in my mind it's you.

00:14:04.553 --> 00:14:06.013 position:50% align:center
Do you mean that?

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:07.848 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA]
I cannot apologize enough

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:09.850 position:50% align:center
for the disrespect
of my comrades.

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:11.727 position:50% align:center
What do you think--
do we like him or nah?

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.437 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] I guess we can
trust him for now.

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS] What an
interesting batch of beings

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.610 position:50% align:center
you've elected to
surround yourself with.

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:21.278 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
Oh, no way!

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center
That cape is Rare equipment.
Crimson Wings!

00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:27.576 position:50% align:center
And is that a Magi-Gun
she's got over her shoulder?

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:30.329 position:50% align:center
So she's the one who
attacked us from the tower?

00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:34.875 position:50% align:center
Laminitus! Don't you
insult this lady again!

00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:38.462 position:50% align:center
If you choose not to heed
my warning, I'll have your head!

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS]
Heh. I'll show as much respect

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
as is shown toward me!

00:14:42.466 --> 00:14:46.220 position:50% align:center
I am the lord who governs
Zircon Tower City, after all.

00:14:46.303 --> 00:14:49.014 position:50% align:center
My name is Fanis Laminitus!

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:50.599 position:50% align:center
And you, sweetheart.

00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:53.393 position:50% align:center
Am I right to assume
you're the Head Priest?

00:14:53.477 --> 00:14:58.190 position:50% align:center
Yes. I am Lumachina Weselia.
It's nice to meet you.

00:14:58.273 --> 00:15:00.901 position:50% align:center
Oh? So the swindlers
got a cutie-patootie

00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:02.945 position:50% align:center
for their top boss, eh?

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:04.613 position:50% align:center
Swindlers? How so?

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:07.824 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS] Heh. A swindler
is someone who does nothing.

00:15:07.908 --> 00:15:10.327 position:50% align:center
But demands a large
donation anyway.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.162 position:50% align:center
How else are we gonna survive?

00:15:12.246 --> 00:15:13.872 position:50% align:center
You closed our
church then charged

00:15:13.956 --> 00:15:15.541 position:50% align:center
obscene taxes for everything!

00:15:15.624 --> 00:15:18.043 position:50% align:center
We need donations!

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.670 position:50% align:center
Isn't your God
supposed to provide

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:21.463 position:50% align:center
bread and wine for you at least?

00:15:21.547 --> 00:15:23.006 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.884 position:50% align:center
We don't have the powers of God,
we just believe in His word,

00:15:25.968 --> 00:15:28.470 position:50% align:center
much of which is filled
with symbolism.

00:15:28.554 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
God will always provide.

00:15:30.222 --> 00:15:31.974 position:50% align:center
Not always in ways we expect.

00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:34.184 position:50% align:center
He serves those who trust Him.

00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:37.312 position:50% align:center
Oh my. I didn't
expect a free sermon.

00:15:37.396 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
Well then, let's put what
I've learned to the test.

00:15:40.983 --> 00:15:42.568 position:50% align:center
You wish upon a star.

00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:45.654 position:50% align:center
And we'll see how
your God serves you!

00:15:46.697 --> 00:15:50.075 position:50% align:center
You are such an insolent woman!

00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:55.372 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
They're so fast! Both of them!

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.749 position:50% align:center
And ridiculously strong!

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.253 position:50% align:center
Turns out none of you actually

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:03.964 position:50% align:center
believe in this
fairy tale either!

00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:05.716 position:50% align:center
Otherwise you
wouldn't have moved!

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.926 position:50% align:center
If He was real,
you'd trust and believe

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.803 position:50% align:center
He'd come to her rescue!

00:16:09.887 --> 00:16:11.555 position:50% align:center
That's mere sophistry!

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:13.682 position:50% align:center
Right. Sophistry.

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:17.311 position:50% align:center
Call it whatever you want, love.
Makes no difference to me.

00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
My objective today is to find
the genius who used that spell.

00:16:21.732 --> 00:16:24.818 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
That's me! I'm the genius! Crap!

00:16:24.902 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
It was you!

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:27.571 position:50% align:center
He knows that, dummy.

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:29.198 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA]
Heh. What a coincidence.

00:16:29.281 --> 00:16:31.116 position:50% align:center
I came here to
find them as well.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.744 position:50% align:center
But it looks like
they have already fled.

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:35.454 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
My man!

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:37.039 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS]
Is that so?

00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:38.498 position:50% align:center
It is!

00:16:38.582 --> 00:16:41.251 position:50% align:center
But what use would you have
for that sorcerer anyway?

00:16:41.335 --> 00:16:43.545 position:50% align:center
[LAMINITUS] Obviously I'd
want them to work for me.

00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:46.006 position:50% align:center
And if they turned me down,
then I'd have to make them

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:48.592 position:50% align:center
regret their decision,
wouldn't I?

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:51.136 position:50% align:center
You certainly are
a piece of work.

00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:54.431 position:50% align:center
I'll find the one with
that power eventually.

00:16:54.515 --> 00:16:58.268 position:50% align:center
They may even be right
under my nose. [chuckles]

00:16:58.352 --> 00:16:59.520 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
She's talking about me!

00:16:59.603 --> 00:17:01.355 position:50% align:center
That was so pointed! She knows!

00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:03.524 position:50% align:center
Game over, man! Game over!

00:17:03.607 --> 00:17:07.361 position:50% align:center
Miss Lumachina,
I am terribly sorry

00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:08.862 position:50% align:center
for her crude behavior.

00:17:08.946 --> 00:17:10.197 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO sighs]

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.533 position:50% align:center
The most annoying woman
in the world is after us.

00:17:12.616 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
[SHERA giggles]
Oh no!

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:16.286 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I couldn't
really understand

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.413 position:50% align:center
a word she was saying!

00:17:18.497 --> 00:17:22.835 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] Optimism or stupidity?
It's a fine, fine line.

00:17:22.918 --> 00:17:25.170 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA] Miss Lumachina,
I imagine you must be

00:17:25.254 --> 00:17:26.964 position:50% align:center
quite tired from your journey.

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
Please, come rest
and relax at my estate.

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:34.054 position:50% align:center
--Hey look! There's a line.
--What now?

00:17:34.137 --> 00:17:35.973 position:50% align:center
What are they waiting for?

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.893 position:50% align:center
[REM]
Oh yeah, I see it.

00:17:39.977 --> 00:17:42.813 position:50% align:center
That's a lot of people.
Is there food?

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:44.815 position:50% align:center
They're lined up at
the tents we had to use

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:46.441 position:50% align:center
for prayer, song, and worship

00:17:46.525 --> 00:17:48.944 position:50% align:center
after Laminitus ordered
the church to close.

00:17:49.027 --> 00:17:50.070 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA gasps]

00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:51.697 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA]
They've been there for days,

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.783 position:50% align:center
hoping to have the priests offer
prayers and receive a miracle.

00:17:54.867 --> 00:17:56.702 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
That's terrible.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.669 position:50% align:center
Even those little children?

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:09.214 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] What about
that group over there?

00:18:09.298 --> 00:18:11.133 position:50% align:center
Are those people
also waiting on prayers?

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:14.136 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA] They are. But that's
the line reserved for

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:16.847 position:50% align:center
those who gave
large Church donations.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.725 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA gasps]
How do the donations work?

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:22.060 position:50% align:center
Please don't misunderstand.

00:18:22.144 --> 00:18:24.771 position:50% align:center
We're short on priests here,
so we aren't able to respond

00:18:24.855 --> 00:18:28.358 position:50% align:center
to all who need prayers
as quickly as we'd like.

00:18:28.442 --> 00:18:30.611 position:50% align:center
It's only natural to
prioritize the believers

00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:32.905 position:50% align:center
who have provided
greater monetary gifts

00:18:32.988 --> 00:18:35.616 position:50% align:center
and who also have
demonstrated greater need.

00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:39.620 position:50% align:center
Whatever the reason,
there are so many people.

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:41.580 position:50% align:center
A bit too many.

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:49.630 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA gasps]
Is that real, live curry?

00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center
And flippin rice?

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:53.717 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Yummy! This smells so good!

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.927 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA]
Please, help yourselves

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.512 position:50% align:center
to whatever you'd like.

00:18:56.595 --> 00:19:00.599 position:50% align:center
Miss Lumachina, if it's not up
to your standards, I understand.

00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
Uh... It looks delicious!

00:19:03.769 --> 00:19:05.229 position:50% align:center
It even has a kick to it!

00:19:05.312 --> 00:19:08.649 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's gonna hurt later,
but so far, it's worth it.

00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:11.276 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] These folks know how to
help a guy eat his feelings!

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.571 position:50% align:center
I never thought I'd see curry
ever again after coming here!

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:18.742 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] Lumachina,
your right hand looks red.

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:20.035 position:50% align:center
What happened to it?

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:21.787 position:50% align:center
Oh, so it is.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.247 position:50% align:center
I guess something
must've flown about

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.542 position:50% align:center
while you were fighting earlier
and I intercepted it.

00:19:26.625 --> 00:19:28.418 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,
the power of miracles

00:19:28.502 --> 00:19:30.462 position:50% align:center
doesn't work on my own body.

00:19:30.546 --> 00:19:32.172 position:50% align:center
Isn't that strange?

00:19:32.256 --> 00:19:34.967 position:50% align:center
I can't hear you!
More food, please!

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:38.595 position:50% align:center
I'd love some more
as well, please.

00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:40.264 position:50% align:center
Coming right up, dear guests.

00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:43.559 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] Excuse me, Batutta,
after we're done here,

00:19:43.642 --> 00:19:46.186 position:50% align:center
would you mind coming
with me for a chat?

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:50.107 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA sighs] I feel like
I ate a small moose.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
Cool water feels nice,
but there are times

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:54.695 position:50% align:center
when a man just
wants a hot bath.

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:57.656 position:50% align:center
And this is definitely
one of those times.

00:19:57.739 --> 00:19:59.533 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Hi! Can I come in?

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:02.160 position:50% align:center
I'm bathing. What's up?

00:20:02.244 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] Um. It's hard for me
to relax, new place, ya know?

00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:08.917 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
That's right. I forgot.

00:20:09.001 --> 00:20:11.128 position:50% align:center
She gets lonely and
restless so easily.

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
Right. Do what you need to do.

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:17.092 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Thank you! By the way,

00:20:17.176 --> 00:20:20.512 position:50% align:center
what did you think of
that curry we had tonight?

00:20:20.596 --> 00:20:22.556 position:50% align:center
It was good, wasn't it?

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:25.976 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] I thought so.
It was especially spicy--

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:30.230 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?

00:20:30.314 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] What do you mean?
I'm taking a bath with you.

00:20:33.317 --> 00:20:35.652 position:50% align:center
And now you have someone
to wash your back.

00:20:35.736 --> 00:20:39.031 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA] This is not okay!
This is the worst idea ever!

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:40.324 position:50% align:center
She's already making me sweat

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:41.825 position:50% align:center
which is making me
sticky and gross!

00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:44.328 position:50% align:center
And I don't even need to
finish that thought right now!

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:46.580 position:50% align:center
[SHERA hums]

00:20:46.663 --> 00:20:50.375 position:50% align:center
[SHERA] I tried to find
a towel, but no luck.

00:20:50.459 --> 00:20:52.044 position:50% align:center
Anyway. How's this?

00:20:52.127 --> 00:20:54.213 position:50% align:center
Uh. Fine.

00:20:54.296 --> 00:20:56.757 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
It feels amazing!

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.511 position:50% align:center
I know! I bet it'll be faster
if we help each other get clean!

00:21:00.594 --> 00:21:02.513 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:02.596 --> 00:21:04.181 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
There!

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:05.724 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO gasps]

00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:07.559 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
What is that? No way!

00:21:07.643 --> 00:21:09.645 position:50% align:center
They're on my back!
They're on my back!

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:12.022 position:50% align:center
If I sit real still
maybe they'll go away!

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:14.107 position:50% align:center
Your back's so stiff.

00:21:14.191 --> 00:21:17.152 position:50% align:center
Must be stress. [gasps]

00:21:17.236 --> 00:21:18.904 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Do you feel that?

00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:22.783 position:50% align:center
It's kinda warm in here.
I'm getting dizzy.

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:23.951 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
What kind of Demon Lord

00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:26.119 position:50% align:center
gets in these
sorts of situations?

00:21:26.203 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
There's an elf in my bath
trying to scrub me with her yums

00:21:28.664 --> 00:21:30.249 position:50% align:center
and it's just
making things worse!

00:21:30.332 --> 00:21:31.875 position:50% align:center
But I can't make it stop!

00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
Am I a Demon Lord or not?

00:21:34.211 --> 00:21:35.712 position:50% align:center
'Kay! All done!

00:21:35.796 --> 00:21:37.714 position:50% align:center
Now I'll wash your front!

00:21:37.798 --> 00:21:40.259 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO gasps]

00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:41.468 position:50% align:center
You're so strong!

00:21:41.552 --> 00:21:44.012 position:50% align:center
You've got muscles
on your tumbo!

00:21:44.096 --> 00:21:47.224 position:50% align:center
Um. I'm a level 150, so.

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:50.018 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
Oh! I almost forgot this area!

00:21:50.102 --> 00:21:50.936 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO gasps]

00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:53.272 position:50% align:center
[SHERA]
What is this?

00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:56.900 position:50% align:center
You never told me you
had a tail. Why hide it?

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.782 position:50% align:center
Uh, it's not a tail.
It's um, a horn.

00:22:03.866 --> 00:22:06.410 position:50% align:center
[SHERA giggles] You can learn
so much about someone

00:22:06.493 --> 00:22:08.203 position:50% align:center
by bathing together.

00:22:08.287 --> 00:22:11.081 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO]
Uh, yes. Yes you can.

00:22:11.999 --> 00:22:13.208 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMA]
These are the times.

00:22:13.292 --> 00:22:14.918 position:50% align:center
The ones I wish
would last forever.

00:22:15.002 --> 00:22:16.295 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:22:16.378 --> 00:22:17.963 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA]
Please come in.

00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:25.929 position:50% align:center
Evening. You said you
wished to speak to me?

00:22:26.013 --> 00:22:29.141 position:50% align:center
Yes. I was hoping
you'd stop by.

00:24:02.693 --> 00:24:04.361 position:50% align:center
[BATUTTA] I'm looking
forward to the moment

00:24:04.444 --> 00:24:06.405 position:50% align:center
when you learn to
succumb to lust.

00:24:06.488 --> 00:24:09.366 position:50% align:center
[DIABLO] It crushed
my heart? What is this?

00:24:09.449 --> 00:24:12.911 position:50% align:center
[LUMACHINA] I refuse to
give in to any curse! Ever!
