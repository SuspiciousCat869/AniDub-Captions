[NANA]
No.

163
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,666
They seem pretty
distracted right now.

164
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,208
Wait, the Shogi Club?

165

[BOYS shouting]

166
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,166
[HOZUMI]
Excuse me.

[gasps]

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,875
[HOZUMI] Are the two of you
looking to join our club?

170
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:32,791
[NANA]
Well, yeah?

171
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,208
[HOZUMI]
Really?! That's awesome!

172
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,000
We're happy to have you!

173
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,291
I'm Hozumi Kohinata,
second year.

174
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,041
It's nice to meetcha!

175
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,583
[HEATH]
Get over here! Do-over!

176
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:42,750
[AYUMU]
No way!

177
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,500
[HOZUMI] Hey, guys!
We got new members!

178
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,500
[HEATH]
Oh, yeah? For which club?

179
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,458
[NANA]
Huh?

180
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,250
[AYUMU]
Your glare.

181
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,500
Your glasses.

182
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,791
Yes!

183
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:53,583
Shogi Club!

184
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,291
No, sir.

185
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,583
Denied!

186
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,000
No offense, but I came
here to join Stride.

187
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:58,583
[HOZUMI]
Ah!

188
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,500
Eh? Wait a sec,

189
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,083
you're Takeru Fujiwara
from Tsurugiya, aren't you?

190
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,125
Yep. That's right.

191
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,041
[AYUMU]
I knew I recognized you!

192
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,041
You're pretty famous in
the Under 15 category.

193
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,541
Can't believe you moved all
the way to Tokyo from Hyogo.

194
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,750
Oh!

195
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,166
--[HOZUMI laughs]
--[NANA] Huh...

196
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,583
Stride's off to a good start

197
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,041
now that we've got a big
name like you on the team.

198
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,916
That means you must be...

199
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,250
Uh...

200
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,583
[AYUMU] The first female
member of the Shogi Club!

201
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,125
No, sir.

202
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,375
Denied again!

203
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,416
Sakurai's here for the
same reason that I am.

204
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,000
Stride.

205
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,166
[HOZUMI]
Huh?!

206
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,583
[NANA] Uh! Oh, um.
It's nice to meet you.

207
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,250
I'm Nana Sakurai.

208
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,416
Your Stride team is the reason
I moved here to Tokyo.

209
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,833
Just to go to Honan.

210
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,708
I'd love to be your manager,
if... you'll have me.

211
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,500
Of course, the more the merrier.

212
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,708
I'm Ayumu Kadowaki, second year.

213
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,833
I'm the "boss of bishops,"
the "keeper of kings,"

214
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,208
the president of the Shogi Club.

215
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,916
[NANA] 'Scuse me. Sorry, but,
we don't wanna play Shogi,

216
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,416
we came here for Stride.

217
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,791
Well, I'm the president and
captain of the Stride Club.

218
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,125
Heath Hasekura. A third year.

219
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,875
Doesn't matter which
club you wanna join,

220
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,875
'cause you're automatically
in both of 'em.

221
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,916
[NANA]
Uh. What do you mean by that?

222
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,375
[HOZUMI]
Here at Honan Academy,

223
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,916
clubs with less than three
members get disbanded.

224
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,958
Basically, if you join
one of our clubs

225
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,666
you're automatically
enrolled in the other

226
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,250
so nobody gets shut down.

227
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,791
[NANA]
Okay, I think I get it now.

228
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,250
So the three of you are...

229
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,500
[AYUMU]
That's right.

230
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,208
Whether you're looking
to join Stride or Shogi,

231
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,625
we're the whole club!

232
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,916
[NANA]
Seriously?

233
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,333
But I saw a video of Honan
Stride on the internet.

234
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,250
It's what made me want
to come to school here,

235
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,416
so I could join the club.

236
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,458
Check it out!

237
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,041
[HEATH]
Video?

238
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,125
[NANA]
Yeah!

239
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,708
You suck, Stride Association!
I hate you!

240
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,166
[HEATH sighs]
Well, then,

241
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,750
tell us what was so great
about this video.

242
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,291
[NANA]
It was amazing!

243
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,250
The first time I'd ever seen
Relations done at full speed.

244
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,375
[gasps]

245
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,875
[NANA] I can't tell you how
much I love Honan Stride!

246
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:06,208
[HOZUMI] Um, so the runners
you saw in that video.

247
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,625
Well, they're third
year students now.

248
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:12,041
Unfortunately, they're not
members of Stride anymore.

249
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,250
[NANA]
Huh?!

250
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,791
[HOZUMI] I know it's not
what you wanna hear

251
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,250
but we just don't
have enough members

252
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,041
to participate in a match.

253
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,500
On the other hand, all the
Shogi team needs is three.

254
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,875
Tell you what,

255
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,375
since you guys came all
this way just for Stride,

256
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,750
we'd be more than happy to
train with you, if you wanted.

257
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,500
[HEATH] If we can't compete in a
match then why bother training?

258
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,291
--[NANA] Uh?
--[TAKERU grunts]

259
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,041
[HOZUMI] Nana, you said you
wanted to be a manager, right?

260
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,750
Well, to compete, each Stride
team needs five runners

261
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,708
and a Relationer for
a total of six members.

262
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:43,375
Find us two more people and we
can start entering tournaments.

263
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,750
Make that three, Hozumi.

264
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,416
Don't count me. I don't
want any part of this!

265
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,125
I promise I can
find you two more!

266
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,666
There's gotta be other students
here who love Stride!

267
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,583
I just have to go
and look for them!

268
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,208
Good luck, nobody wants
to join Stride anymore.

269
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,458
I'll make it happen,
you just watch me!

270
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,333
There has to be someone
else at this school

271
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,125
who loves it as much as us!

272
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:01,666

Yeah, we've been keeping
up with our training.

278
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:09,958
That way, the 'keeper of kings'

279
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,875
might actually be able to
make it through a match.

280
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,583
[AYUMU]
You lied to me! Traitor!

281
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,833
I thought we were training

282
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,375
to become the fastest
Shogi Club in the world!

Listen, bro.

285
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,791
We had to trick you into
training, so that way,

286
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,375
when the time came, your body
would be ready for Stride!

287
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,625
[AYUMU] What have you done
to my once doughy physique?

288
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,250
You asked why you
should bother training

289
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,583
when you can't even
compete in matches.

290
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,875
And yet, you went
out of your way

291
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,041
to train a complete outsider.

292

293

Uh. Yeah?

294
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,750
We came to this
school for Stride,

295
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,291
so it's up to us
to make it happen.

296
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,625
I promise that I'll find
you two more members!

297
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:58,875
And when I do, then we can be a
full-fledged Stride Club, right?

298
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,291
[HEATH]
Yeah, sure.

299
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,416
If you can make it happen
then I don't see why not.

You can be in all
the clubs you want!

Then count me in!

321
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,750
Hello, Riku!

322
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,458
Heh! What's up, Nana?

323
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,250
Uh...

324
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,666
What are you doing
with this guy?

325
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,458
Hey, thanks again
for this morning.

326
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,750
I got some blood on this,

327
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,291
so I'm gonna have to
get you a new one.

328
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,208
Oh, no, you really
don't have to do that.

Listen, what's fair is fair.

330
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,000
C'mon, I gotta pay
you back somehow.

331
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,125
Okay.

332
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,083
Well, there is something
that you can do for me.

333
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,625
I could use another
member in my club--

334
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,833
especially someone
who's as fast as you!

335
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,333
Ya think so?

336
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,041
Then you can count me in!
I'd be happy to help you out!

You mean it?

338
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,250
Yeah, I love all sports.

339
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,500
Well, I take that back, all
of them except for Kabaddi.

Yeah.

342
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,958
You have to say
"kabaddikabaddikabaddi"

really fast and it
makes me bite my--

Let's go.

347
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,125
[RIKU]
Uh... What was your name?

348
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,375
Like, Takeru?

349
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,583
So, uh. Are you also a member

350
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,333
of this club Nana's
trying to put together?

351
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,125
[TAKERU]
Obviously.

352
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,500
C'mon, let's take him
back to the others.

[RIKU]
Uh...

354
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,291
Okay, guys.

355
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,708
You wanna tell me
what club I'm joining?

356
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,291

The Honan Stride Club.

Here. We found one.

He doesn't look too happy.

366
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,541
Does he? Did he agree
to join the club?

367
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,750
--Yes, sir.
--[NANA] Well...

Huh.

You're killing me, Hozumi!

It's you.

He's a Yagami?

No way, you've gotta be kidding!

374
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,333
I mean, what are the odds?

375
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,291
[HEATH]
No joke. It's crazy.

376
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,708
Destiny is seriously in motion.

I'm a man of my word.

379
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,791
Looks like we're back
in action, you guys.

380
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,916
Sweet, now that we've got
five runners, we're ready!

381
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,875
You're still counting me
in that number, aren't you?

382
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,041
Of course.

383
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,458
Why do you think I
kept making you do

384
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,416
all that training with us?

385
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,583
Tough break, bro.

386
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,208
Man, this sucks!
You guys tricked me!

387
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,000
[HOZUMI] All club activities
are based on deception!

388
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,291
[AYUMU]
Ooh, Sun Tzu.

389
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,750
Someone thinks they're smart.

390
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,750
[HEATH] All right, that's
enough! Play nice, you two.

391
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,916
Okay, so all we need
is a Relationer

392
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,958
and we can start entering
tournaments, right?

393
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:02,791
--Yeah.
--[HOZUMI] Uh-huh!

394
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:03,916
[TAKERU]
We have one.

395
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,958
[NANA]
Huh?

396
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,166
[NANA]
Who, me?

397
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,208
But, I don't know if girls
are allowed to be Relationers.

398
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,375
[HOZUMI]
Sure they are.

399
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,625
It's rare but I've
seen it happen before.

400
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,958
They're usually on
the best teams, too.

401
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,750
No way.

402
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,833
I never could've imagined
this would happen.

403
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:29,375
Me... a Relationer
for Honan Stride!

404
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,625
Hey, uh.

405
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,083
I'm not really
into Stride, so...

406
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,125
Uh? I don't wanna force you,
but you said you'd help.

407
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,875
Yeah, and I'm not
gonna let you down.

408
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,500
Besides, you're not the one
who's holding me against my--

409
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,375
Watch it.

410
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,875
You're getting on my last nerve!

411
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,875
[TAKERU] We came to Honan
Academy to join the Stride Club.

412
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,291
[RIKU] What does that
have to do with me?!

413
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,541
Let go! Seriously!

414
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,875
Cut it out!

00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,875
[CAT TOY]
Meow.

417
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:53,875
[HOZUMI]
Stop yelling!

418
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,916
You won't solve
anything that way.

419
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,208
Here's an idea,

420
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,708
how 'bout we settle this
with a friendly match?

421
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,583
[CAT TOY]
Meow.

422
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,125
[AYUMU]
Color me intrigued.

423
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,250
Please go on, kitty,
tell us more.

424
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,750
[HOZUMI]
All right.

425
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:08,208
I propose that we resolve
this argument once and for all

426
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,666
with a one-off Stride match

427
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,500
that'll determine
the fate of the club!

428
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,791
--[NANA laughs]
--[RIKU] Uh...

[HEATH] Hey guys, Heath
from Stride Club here.

430
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,916
Sorry for the short notice but
we're gonna have a race tonight.

431
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,125
Yep, you heard me!

432
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,666
Stride Club is back!
Thanks for your support!

433

Interesting.

The Stride Club is still around?

435
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,791
[STUDENT 1C] It's gonna be
a two-on-two mini-match.

436
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,458
[STUDENT 1D] Why would anyone
wanna join a running club?

437
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,041
[STUDENT 1E]
Bring me some marking tape!

438
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,875
[STUDENT 1F]
We need more mats over here!

439
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,875
[STUDENT 1G]
Hey new kid, come help us out.

440

[STUDENT 1H]
Extra! Extra!

441
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,583
The Stride Club is back!

442
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,958
[STUDENT 1AA]
I'm gonna go watch the match.

443
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,250
[STUDENT 1BB] The older girls
told us not to mess

444
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,791
with the Stride Club.

445
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,125
[STUDENT 1CC] Yeah, but what's
the harm in watching? C'mon!

446
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,500
[FEMALE STUDENTS giggle]

447
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,333
[ANNOUNCER 1AA] The race
will begin in ten minutes.

448
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,458
During the match we ask
that you please refrain

449
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,083
from entering the
course perimeter.

450
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,708
If you must pass through,

451
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,708
look for a cheerleader with an
armband and ask for assistance.

452
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,500
[NANA]
Wow. Everybody's really excited!

453
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,291
[AYUMU laughs]
Crazy to think

454
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,083
our club's on the verge
of disbanding.

455
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,000
I mean, whenever
there's a match,

456
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,708
spectators come out in droves
just to watch it go down.

457
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:20,000
Since we race city streets
it kinda turns into a party.

458
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,833
Tonight we're only doing
a lap inside the school.

459
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,000
It's a lot shorter than
a real Stride course

460
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,458
but that doesn't mean
it's gonna be easy.

461
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,750
There are plenty of
drop-offs and sharp turns

462
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,708
that are gonna require some
finesse from our runners.

463
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,500
The most dangerous
part of the course

464
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,125
is probably the narrow hallway

465
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,333
that's being used
as the Takeover Zone.

466
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,666
You'll have to pay close
attention to the Relationing.

467
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,041
No need to worry, you just
have to trust your runner.

468
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,333
[NANA]
Right.

469
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,625
[ANNOUNCER 1AA] The race
will begin in one minute.

470
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:54,166
[HOZUMI sighs]
I'm starting to get pumped!

471
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,833
Hang on.

472
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,041
Don't you need your
glasses for the race?

473
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,750
No, I prefer to wear
contacts when I'm running.

474
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,583
[HOZUMI] All right, Takeru,
let's do our best out there!

475
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,625
[TAKERU]
Yeah.

476
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:17,833
[RIKU] I wonder.
Can Takeru pull this off?

477
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:21,458
What if he gets lazy and
keeps us from winning?

478
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,625
That would mean...

479
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,958
[HEATH]
Aw, man.

480
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,875
I forgot all about
the pre-race nerves.

481
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,625
It's been a while
since I had 'em.

482
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,583
I kinda missed it.

483
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,958
[RIKU]
Yeah, me too.

484
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,041
It's been a long time.

485
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,416
Okay, Riku and Takeru.
