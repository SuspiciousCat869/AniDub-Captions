[HOZUMI]
I'm can't use acrobatics

164
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,250
to get ahead this time.

165
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,083
I'll just have to keep him in my
sights and run as fast as I can!

166
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,625
[BANTARO] I think I might've
started off a little too fast.

167
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,750
Maybe I should pull back.

Don't slow down.

You can do it.
Keep your speed up.

[BANTARO chuckles]
Yeah, that's what I thought.

Yeah, well, it's not
gonna be your team.

Why even run if you
know you won't win?

179
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,750

the practice match.

I mean, I don't wanna tell
you what to do or anything,

Why? Is my runnin' style
weird or somethin'?

Well no, it's not
that it's weird.

Just kinda hunched
over is all. Here.

It's not like there
was anything wrong

242
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,250
with the way you were running,

243
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,500

get more oxygen to your lungs.

pointers to the enemy?

but try not to worry so much!

you come with me?

Oh, wow.

262
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,708
It's important to
watch play-back

263
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,333
to see how your calls
are affecting your team.

264

There's something
I'm dying to know.

265
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,791
How do you give your team
such accurate instructions?

266
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:21,958
You had me floored during
the practice match.

267
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,791
I just listen to
their breathing.

00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,125
[NANA]
Huh?

269
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,625
[SHIZUMA]
I know this might sound odd,

270
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,041
but when I listen to
my runners' breathing.

271
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,833
I feel as if I can hear
what they're thinking.

272
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,416
"I don't want to lose."

273
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,000
"Oh, no, he passed me."

274
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,166
"This is my chance to shine."

275
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,708
[NANA laughs]
I know that feeling.

276
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:43,333
[SHIZUMA] I nestle up close
to them, figuratively speaking.

277
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,416
When you know what
your runner wants,

278
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,666
then you can give
them instructions

279
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,000
to reach their goal.

280
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,708
It's my job to lead them,
but, in all honesty,

281
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,750
they're the ones
who are leading me.

282
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,500
Yeah, that makes sense.

283
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,708
I wanna help my teammates
reach their goals, too.

284
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,583
[SHIZUMA] And you can.
It's all about trust.

285
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,291
You'll be a more
confident Relationer

286
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,500
if you build a trusting
relationship with your runners.

287
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,250
That's all it takes?

288
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,916
Then that's what
I need to work on.

289
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,583
[STRIDE CLUB]
Thank you for the food!

290
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,083
Aw, yeah! I'm about
to tear it up!

291
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,583
For real!

292
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,833
Hold up.
What's that on your rice?

293
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,166
[TAKERU]
Protein powder.

294
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,083
[RIKU]
Ah!

295
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,333
[SHIZUMA]
Just so you know,

296
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,916
there's no need to add
protein to your meal.

297
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,416
I can assure you

298
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,375
that our team of dietitians know
exactly how much we need.

299
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,708
[TAKERU]
Well, according to this...

300
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,083
The chicken teriyaki
contains 336 kcals

301
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,708
and 21.4 grams of protein.

302
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,833
The croquette, 189 kcals
and 2.8 grams of protein.

303
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,083
Add in the seaweed,
salad, and miso,

304
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,083
then compare it to the
kcal deficit from training,

305
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,375
and we still need 73 grams of
protein to achieve myogenesis.

306
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,416
[SHIZUMA] Extra protein
was added to the teriyaki,

307
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,250
the chicken was coated
before it was cooked.

308
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,375
Now, you've burned about
1,800 kcals so far today.

309
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,375
Taking basal metabolism
into account,

310
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,250
you'll need to ingest
around 4,000 kcals

311
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,875
to make up for kcals lost.

312
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,250
While that may seem like a
feat with such a light menu,

313
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,208
each item's been

[TAKERU] Seriously?
You mean even the apples?

316
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,083
[SHIZUMA]
Why yes, of course!

317
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,958
They just had to ruin dessert.

[BOTH sigh]

319
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,666
Whaddya say we have an
apple-eating contest

320
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,500
to top it off?

Heck yeah! Count me in!

Hang on!

00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,583
I'm in, too.

324
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,958
You mind if I get in
on the action?

00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,208
Ready...

Go!

327
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,041
[HOZUMI] So what exactly
did you guys put in these?

328

[BANTARO]
You sure wanna know?

[HOZUMI, AYUMU]
Nope, no thanks!

330

Whatever it is,
I'm sure it's gross!

331
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:35,041
[SHIZUMA] For the record, I was
just kidding about the apples.

332
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:39,000
[NANA sighs] It was nice having
that giant bath all to myself.

333
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,208
I mean, talk about a luxury.

334
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:45,375
[RIKU laughs] Well, well, don't
you look cute in your yukata!

335
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,916
[NANA]
It's you guys!

336
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,333
I don't think I've ever seen
you with your hair down before.

337
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,500
I've gotta admit,
it looks good like that.

[HEATH]
You think so?

340
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,541
I'll see you later.
I'm going for a run.

Right now?

00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,958
Lemme get this straight,

343
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,083
you just took a bath and
you're gonna go sweat again?

344

That guy's got problems.

Hey, Honan!

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,250
Reiji wants everyone
to come upstairs.

350
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,416
More training?

351

But I thought we were
done for the day!

352
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,166
We're playing a
ping-pong tourney!

[HOZUMI]
Yeah! Woohoo!

Let's up the stakes.

355
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,000
How 'bout we make
the losing team

356
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,750
do something really
embarrassing?

something real sappy!

Yeah! Woohoo!

Jeez, I can think of a million
things I'd rather do

than play a stupid
ping-pong tourney.

You're welcome to
join me on my run.

Are you coming with me, Yagami?

[TAKERU grunts]

I hate to break it to you,

368
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,583
but if you two don't play,
you'll lose by default.

We will destroy you.

It didn't hit you that hard!

pay for this.

with you again.

[ASUMA] That was our
last game of the tourney.

[REIJI]
Thanks.

They never should've
agreed to play us.

393
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,041
It's obvious which
team is stronger,

not just at Stride,
but in general.

I think someone owes us a song!

That's right,
you know the rules!

just any ol' song,

471
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:47,791
I like to call this one

472
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,708
my "Sparkling Figure
Eight" illusion!

473
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,416
You certainly know how
to put on a show!

474
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,041
But ditch the sparklers
and pull out the big guns!

475
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,250
[AYUMU laughs] Well,
if that's what you want,

476
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,291
then here you go--

477
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,000
[screams]

478
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,916
[RIKU] You've got sparks
on your face, senpai!

479
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,958
Stop, drop, and roll!

480
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,583
[KYOSUKE]
Ayumu! Are you okay?

481
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:06,791
[AYUMU]
Yeah, I guess so,

482
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,416
considering I almost
burnt myself to a crisp.

483
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,625
[NANA]
You wanna join us?

484
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:11,583
[TAKERU]
Uh!

485
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,000
You wanna join us?

486
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,583
[KYOSUKE]
Your hair's still smoking.

487
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,041
[BANTARO] You Honan guys
are a barrel of laughs, man!

488
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,291
[SHIZUMA]
That's enough, Bantaro.

489
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,333
[RIKU] Hey Nana, do you
have any more fireworks?

490
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,708
The other guys used up
all the ones you gave me.

491
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:23,958
[laughs]

492
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,208
Whoa, did your sparkler
just changes colors?

493
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,041
Uh-huh!

494
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,333
[RIKU]
That's cool, but...

495
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,041
Look what I can do!

496
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,666
Wow, that's amazing!
It's so pretty!

497
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,791
[RIKU]
Look what I can do!

[TAKERU]
Sparklers on the beach.

499
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,416
Just like the last time.

500
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
What?

501
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,125
[RIKU] Hold up.
Am I missin' somethin'?

502
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,708
When was "last time"?

503
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,291
[TAKERU]
Never mind.

504
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,041
[RIKU]
I'm goin' in!

505
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,791
Are you seriously gonna
swim in your clothes?

506
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,041
[RIKU]
Last one in's a rotten egg!

507
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,583
[NANA] Why's it always
have to be a competition?

508
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,083
[laughing]

509
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,500
I had a lot of fun hangin'
out with you guys.

510
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,375
Next time we'll see you
is at End of Summer.

511
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,625
And we'll beat you!

512
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:39,875
Yeah right, I'll believe
it when I see it, buddy!

513
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:40,916
This for me?

[exhales]

517
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,208
[TAKERU] Just so you know;
I won't lose next time.

518
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,958
I can't wait to practice
everything I've learned!

519
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,500
I'm more perceptive
than you think.

520
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,833
I sense them.

521
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,625
The feelings you
have hidden inside.

522
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,166
Next time we run together,
set them free.

523
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,875
[TAKERU]
I promise.

All right, time to go!

[ALL]
Thanks for a successful camp!

526
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,000
[RIKU]
I couldn't beat Asuma.

527
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,500
And even though
we tried our best

528
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,333
we couldn't beat Saisei once!

529
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,333
Still, I've learned so much,

530
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,916
I feel like a superhero
who just powered up!

531
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,958
Next time!

532
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,333
Next time we'll win it!

533
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:25,875
[RIKU]
Thanks again, guys!

534
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,916
And may the best team win at
the End of Summer tournament!
