1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,208
[NANA]
Stride.

2
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,416
It's a spark that ignites
a runner's will

3
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,083
to reach faraway places
and lofty goals.

4
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:55,458
[NANA] In an unfamiliar town,
on an unfamiliar road,

5
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:59,125
five runners and one Relationer
come together,

6
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:02,875
with their hearts connected,
running like the wind.

7
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,041
[NANA]
Two hands slap together.

8
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,833
A relay so perfect,

9
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:20,000
it's as if they had no doubt
that it would happen.

10
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:23,000
Energy is transferred from
one runner to the next.

11
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,541
Which then pushes that runner
to move even faster.

12
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:32,083
[NANA] Stride.
It brings people together.

13
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:35,333
It requires more trust and
connection between teammates

14
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,000
than any other sport.

15
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,625
[HOZUMI]
Not bad! Not bad guys.

16
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,958
Riku, don't push
against the landing

17
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,875
you need to remember to cushion
it so you can soften the blow.

18
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,625
Don't put excess pressure
on your ankles.

19
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:24,333
Gotcha!

20
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,500
[HOZUMI]
And Takeru,

21
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,000
you're starting your
jump a little early.

22
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,541
Get closer before
you make your move.

23
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,166
Will do.

24
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,458
Hey, Ayumu.

25
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,208
Let's raise the bar another
five centimeters!

26
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,791
[AYUMU]
Aye aye, sir!

27
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,416
I'd like you to spend some time
working on defensive tactics.

28
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,833
It'll depend on the course,

29
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,166
but the streets in Shibuya
are pretty narrow.

30
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,916
Let's try a two-hundred meter
dash with a tighter track.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,416
Kuga, I want you to block
Hasekura from passing

32
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,166
and come in under 24 seconds.

33
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,375
--[KYOSUKE] Sounds good.
--[HEATH] Let's do it!

34
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,500
[HEATH]
All right, listen up.

35
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,041
[RIKU]
It's so hot!

36
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,958
It's summer, of course
it's gonna be hot.

37
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,500
No! Really?!
I thought it was winter!

38
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,416
[HEATH] You don't have to
be such a smart ass, bro.

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,166
[AYUMU]
Here.

40
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,041
[HOZUMI]
Oh, thank you.

41
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,250
It's so stinking hot

42
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,041
I was worried I was
gonna melt head first.

43
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,041
[HEATH] You need to remember
to stay hydrated, guys.

44
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,083
We only have two weeks
until the Kakyoin match.

45
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,375
We gotta be at our best
or we don't stand a chance.

46
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,041
So make sure you
get plenty of rest,

47
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,000
at least seven or
eight hours a night.

48
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,833
[AYUMU] Ooh! Did you secretly
sneak off to medical school

49
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,125
and become a doctor? You've
got all the pro health tips!

50
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,833
Hooray for Dr. Hasekura!

51
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,166
[HEATH]
Would you morons shut up?

52
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,208
[BOTH]
Whatever you say, Doctor!

53
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,541
All right everyone.

54
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,166
Let's get back to work.

55
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,791
It's about time we moved
on to Relation practice.

56
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,083
Now listen up,
the relay order's gonna be

57
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:41,541
Yagami, Kuga, Kohinata,
Hasekura, and then Fujiwara.

58
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,125
[ALL]
Yes sir!

59
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,208
We're counting on you, anchor.

60
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,708
Our will is in your hands.
It's up to you, Takeru.

61
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,458
Yep. You've totally got this!

62
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,333
It's crazy to think we've
got a first-year runner

63
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,750
as our anchor but you're
just that awesome, man!

64
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,291
[HOZUMI]
No doubt about it!

65
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,958
Forget it.

66
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,500
Yagami should be the anchor
in the Kakyoin match.

67
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,625
Uh!

68
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,583
[HOZUMI]
Uh. Hold up.

69
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,833
What did he say?!

70
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,708
You want Riku with his
incredible rocket start

71
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,541
to be our anchor?!

72
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,875
Are you serious?

73
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,000
I dunno, man.

74
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,458
Riku's never run
that position before.

75
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,375
It'd be like we were starting
over from scratch.

76
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,708
We can't just put
him in the position

77
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,708
and see how it works out
at the friggin' finals.

78
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,416
[TAKERU]
Trust me.

79
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,166
It may sound crazy, but he'll
run faster than anyone

80
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,708
if he runs against Tomoe.

81
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,125
[AYUMU]
Huh. He's got a good point

82
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,375
but there's no way
of guaranteeing

83
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,333
Tomoe's gonna run
anchor for Kakyoin.

84
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,875
[RIKU]
It'll be him. I know it.

85
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,541
He's the fastest
runner they've got.

86
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,625
It's a risky move, but please...

87
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,750
I want to run
against my brother.

88
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,250
[TAKERU]
Please take a chance on Riku

89
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,750
and grant him this opportunity.

90
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,958
[RIKU]
It would mean the world to me

91
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,958
if you'd let me be the anchor.

92
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,666
[TAKERU, RIKU]
We're begging you!

93
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,791
What the...?! Seriously?

94
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,291
I don't have any
problem with it.

95
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,166
Are you kiddin' me?

96
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,000
No, it makes perfect
sense to me.

97
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,375
Given their history,

98
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,500
Riku's bound to run his
fastest against his brother.

99
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,708
He's very strong willed.

100
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,333
'Kay, Let's go for it.

101
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,583
[HEATH]
Uh.

102
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,000
[AYUMU] Riku's got an
impressive starting dash

103
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,500
but in our last match he
proved he's got stamina, too.

104
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,791
You saw it!

105
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,333
He even got faster towards
the end of the race!

106
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,708
[HOZUMI]
Whaddya think?

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,583
[sighs] Am I the only
one who's worried

108
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,458
about taking a risk
this late in the game?

109
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,333
[HOZUMI] Aw c'mon,
you know you're all for it!

110
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,375
Just admit it!

111
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:44,541
Well, Mr. Dan. Whaddya think?

112
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,916
[DAN]
Mm. <i>Manjou icchi</i> .

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,541
From this day forward,

114
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:53,208
we will practice with Yagami
in the anchor position.

115
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,125
[RIKU] Thank you, sir!
You won't regret it!

116
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,333
That Practice nearly killed me!

117
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,458
No joke. And look at those guys.

118
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,541
I can't believe they're still
going at it after that.

119
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,083
[HOZUMI grunts]
They're just nervous

120
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,250
'cause we haven't done
a Takeru to Riku relation

121
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,916
since the beginning
of the school year.

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,250
[AYUMU] How has it been
four months already?

123
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,583
Time sure flies when
you're having fun.

124
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,250
Yep.

125
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,458
That reminds me.

126
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,541
[AYUMU]
U-Uh...

127
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,750
[HOZUMI]
It's been a long time

128
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,958
since we've played
a game of Shogi.

129
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,375
We're not playin'...

130
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,541
...till we win!

131
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,125
[HEATH]
What a crazy day.

132
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,166
I really hope we made the right
choice lettin' Riku be anchor.

133
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,500
It's funny, he didn't even
wanna join Stride at first.

134
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:49,625
Now our chances of winning
EOS are all ridin' on him.

135
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:53,500
You had to have known
this might happen.

136
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,291
Yeah, I guess.

137
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:59,750
The thought crossed my mind
when I heard his last name.

138
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:03,541
Even so, I chose to give
him the starter position.

139
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,666
It works for him.

140
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,291
He's not great at obstacles,

141
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,875
and most courses have a ton
of 'em towards the end.

142
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,333
He'll be an awesome anchor,

143
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:13,291
but I'm losin' the fastest
starting dash on the team.

144
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,333
I dunno who to put in his place.

145
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,875
[KYOSUKE snickers]

146
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:17,958
[HEATH]
I heard that.

147
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,458
What's so funny, bro?

148
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,375
Nothing.

149
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,708
[sighs] There's so
much to figure out,

150
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,375
and I'm runnin' outta time.

151
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll see ya.

152
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,000
Later.

153
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:33,625
Uh? Hey wait a minute,
where's your bike?

154
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,833
It's at home.

155
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,791
I'm not riding,
not until finals are over!

156
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,791
What is with you guys?

157
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,416

[RIKU] Remember when we
used to run together?

328
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,166
Even though you'd cheer me on,

329
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,083
I could never seem
to catch up with you.

330
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,333
It bothered me so much
it created a block

331
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,500
that kept me from
getting any faster.

332
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,958
[RIKU] I decided I might
as well give up on Stride

333
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,375
since I could never
be as good as you.

334
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,125
But I realized...

335
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,791
...I couldn't completely
give up on it.

336
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,750
I would skip the bus,
run to school,

337
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,458
and jump the gates
when I was late.

[RIKU]
When I started at Honan,

340
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,416
a couple of weirdoes
pushed me to join Stride.

341
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,416
It's more like they forced me,

342
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,083
but to be honest,
I'm really glad they did.

[RIKU] Before we joined, Honan
Stride was a shell of a club.

345

It was just Heath,
Hozumi, and Ayumu,

346
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,500
so they were happy to have us.
