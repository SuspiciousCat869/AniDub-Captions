[RIKU]
Yeah.

I'm kinda hurt that you
never called to tell me.

you had talent.

Man, Heath's either really
focused or we finally broke him.

18
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:21,875
He's probably as upset about the
time trial results as we are.

19
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,416
[AYUMU] I know precisely
what's bothering him!

20
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,083
He must be suffering
from B.N.S disorder!

What's that stand for?

22
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,375
[AYUMU] Allow me to explain,
B.N.S. is short for

You're right, with
his bad grades

I'm sure his teachers assigned
him a ton of it, too!

Let's face it, even though
Heath is good looking,

and team captain,
he's just not all that bright.

Poor guy.

29
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,000
He's so close to the T3A!

I'm only being honest.

However, your time
wasn't all that bad.

48

It was comparable to
the other two schools.

I saw in Hokkaido,

but we could really use

59
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,125
some words of encouragement
from our captain.

60

That's enough.

Yeah, I'm fine.

[RIKU] Me, too. I grazed
him a little, that's all.

[NANA] I'm so sorry!
I made the call too soon!

No, you did fine;
we messed up!

Look, Yagami.

You've gotta keep a steady pace
going into the Takeover Zone.

What's your deal?!

165
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,291
Why are you always blaming
everything on me?!

166
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,708
I'm not blaming you.

167
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:49,750
I'm simply pointing
out a problem.

I get it, okay?!

keep "pointing it out"!

Shut up!

Can't you see that I'm
trying to help you?!

172

In Stride, one member's problem
affects the entire team!

[RIKU] Okay, then what
about your problems?

[TAKERU exhales]

Tell me what all
my problems are.

And I'll work hard to fix them.

solves everything, don't you?

Well, some of us just
aren't as talented.

I wish we could cancel
tomorrow's practice.

Look, I don't wanna be here
on a Saturday either,

but the finals are
comin' up fast.

[AYUMU]
Since I'm not running at EOS

204
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,625
I should be exempt
from weekend practices.

Scratch that, I should be
exempt from all of them.

to go to the beach

Man, that last jump you did
over the edge was totally rad!

282
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,791
Taking advantage of the water
flow makes it too easy.

283
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,458
You barely had to
exert any force

284
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,500
but we should be pushing
our bodies while training.

285
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,500
Oh.

286
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,291
You're right. Good point.

The underlying message
didn't get through to them.

Which is weird 'cause
I thought the whole

289
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,708
"workin' together" thing
was pretty straightforward.

290
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,333
Maybe we should try
something sneakier.

291
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,875
I'm not sure subtlety is
the way to go, senpai.

And I betcha they're gonna stay
neck and neck the whole way!

300
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,208
They're using healthy
competition to push each other

301
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,250
to new limits they
never thought possible!

302
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,666
Yeah! Besides,
it's only natural for athletes

303
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,125
to wanna compete against
their teammates sometimes.

304
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,541
Right? A little rivalry's
good, isn't it?

305
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,541
[RIKU]
Huh? Uh. Yeah, I guess so.

306
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,041
[NANA] Uh... Oh!
What're you doin' over there?

307
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,833
I don't see how this could be
considered "hardcore" training.

308
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,708
Well uh... They're swimming?

309
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,916
It's a tie. Competing
with you is always fun.

310
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,375
You've really helped me
break out of my shell.

311
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,083
Hey, thanks, I've learned
a lot from our healthy rivalry,

312
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,416
it's even made me stronger.

313
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,833
If we keep it up we'll
be unstoppable, bro!

314
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:43,875
[BOTH grunt]

315
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,750
Huh?

316
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:48,958
All righty!

317
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,625
Now it's Takeru and Riku's turn!

318
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,875
[RIKU]
Huh?!

319
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,208
[HOZUMI laughs]
C'mon, no need to be nervous!

320
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,875
I don't wanna swim, I just
wanna chill by the pool.

321
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,125
[AYUMU] Remember, this is
about healthy competition,

322
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,291
so don't kill each other.

323
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,541
I'm not racing.

324
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,916
[ALL]
Uh...

325
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,291
[AYUMU] You've been talking
about training all day

326
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,708
and this is your chance,

327
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,125
swimming's a full-body
exercise so you'll be working

328
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,666
the same muscles
you use while running!

329
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,708
Forget it.

330
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:14,083
[TAKERU]
The truth is... I can't swim.

331
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,583
[HOZUMI] Why didn't you
tell us that sooner?

332
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,083
Good one, dude!

333
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,791
Got it! Here, Heath!

334
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,208
[HEATH]
And spike!

335
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,333
[TAKERU grunts]

336
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,000
[HEATH] Couldn't have
done it without you guys!

337
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,666
In volleyball, you have
to work together as a team.

338
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,791
You've got no choice.

339
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,833
Not if you wanna win
the game, anyway.

340
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:39,791
If we join forces I know that
we can kick the senpais' butts!

341
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,875
Here! Uh!

342
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,000
[RIKU]
All right! Nice bump!

343
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,000
[HEATH] Now all you gotta
do is set the ball, Riku.

344
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,500
[KYOSUKE] And then let
Takeru go in for the spike!

345
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,500
[AYUMU] No matter how
stubborn the players are,

346
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,125
everyone's gotta work
together to win the game.

347
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,500
That's the beauty of...
beach volleyball!

348
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,708
[RIKU grunts]

349
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,250
[HOZUMI]
I thought they almost had it!

350
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,291
[AYUMU] How could you go and
spike the ball like that?!

351
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,041
[NANA sighs]

352
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,666
Got it!

353
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,208
[HEATH sighs]

354
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,500
Jeez, how'd the first-years get
more physically fit than me?!

355
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:28,125
[KYOSUKE] Riku's the one
I find surprising.

356
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,458
I think our goal to teach them
the importance of teamwork

357
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,916
was a bust, they've proven
you can win without it.

358
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,791
[AYUMU] Okay everyone,
what flavors do you want?

359
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,291
I'll take the Blue Hawaii.

360
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,041
Strawberry for me, please.

361
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,250
[HOZUMI]
Melon for me.

362
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,708
[RIKU] Can you get me
a lemon one, please?

363
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,791
[AYUMU] Mm-hm. I think I'm
gonna go with sweet cream.

364
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,208
And you, Takeru?

365
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,958
[TAKERU] No, thanks.
I don't want the empty calories.

366
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,708
What about you?
Which one would you like?

367
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:59,166
I'll take this one, please.
The bucket of snow cone!

368
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,875
[AYUMU screams]

369
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,083
[SHOPKEEPER 9A]
Miss, are you sure about that?

370
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,000
It's too much for one person.

371
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,458
I've only ever seen a team
of grown men finish it.

372
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,500
They were sumo wrestlers.

373
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,500
Okay, then that
sounds perfect, Sir!

374
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,625
Hey, I don't know if this
is such a good idea.

375
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,416
If they don't play along
you're gonna be screwed.

376
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,833
[NANA] Yeah, I know but
I have to give it a try.

377
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,500
There's no turning back
once I get all fired up!

378
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,083
[HEATH]
Uh...

379
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,291
[NANA whimpering]

380
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,000
[KYOSUKE]
It's massive.

381
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,250
Yeah, I wouldn't even
call it a snow cone.

382
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,708
It's more like an iceberg.

383
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,750
Are you sure you wanna do this?

384
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:37,500
I'm gonna finish it and I can
do it myself if I have to!

385
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,583
You've got three minutes
to eat it. Nana, get set.

386
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,083
[NANA gasping]

387
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,791
[HOZUMI]
Three, two, one...

388
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,291
Go!

389
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,708
[NANA groaning]

390
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:58,083
Just eat as much as you
can and then give up.

00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,583
[NANA groaning]

392
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,625
[NANA]
What're you doing?!

393
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,250
You're allowed to have a team
of up to three people, right?

394
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,875
Figured I'd give it a shot!

395
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,916
[RIKU groaning]

396
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,375
Here, let me take over!

397
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,041
[HEATH]
Man, he's really goin' at it!

398
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,583
He's shoveling it in but the
poor guy's still only halfway.

399
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,291
I dunno how much
more I can watch.

400
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,208
How much time do they have?

401
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,041
[HOZUMI]
Less than a minute!

402
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,416
[NANA]
Don't push yourself, Riku!

403
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,250
Give it to me!

404
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,541
I'm good. Thanks.

405
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,208
I'm almost... there.

406
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,000
[TAKERU]
Hand it over.

407
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,000
[RIKU]
You're jumpin' in?!

408
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,416
Whoa, he's drinkin' it!

409
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,833
[AYUMU]
He's swallowing it

410
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,416
before his mouth can communicate
the chill to his brain!

411
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,125
[HEATH] That doesn't sound too
healthy, if you ask me, bro.

412
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,666
[TAKERU grunts]

413
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,208
[AYUMU]
He bypassed the brain

414
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,125
but now the cold's
hitting his stomach!

415
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,125
[HEATH] Man, this sucks!
They're so close!

416
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,208
Only ten seconds left!

--[RIKU] Nice work, buddy!
--[HOZUMI] Nine!

418
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,875
But I'll take it from here!

00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,583
[HOZUMI]
Six... five... four...

[CROWD cheering]

422
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:22,750
[SHOPKEEPER 9A]
You did it, kids.

423
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:23,625
You finished it!

424
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:24,833
[STRIDE CLUB cheering, laughing]

425
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,333
[AYUMU]
Way to go, Honan!

426
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,166
[CROWD cheers]

427
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,041
We make a pretty good team.

428
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,666
[TAKERU]
Uh.

429
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,875
[stomachs rumbling]

430
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,583
[sighs] Oh, well.

431
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,458
Least they finally
worked together.

432
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,208
Took us a little while
but we got the job done.

433
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,416
Well done, Nana.

434
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,125
You never let up on those two.

435
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,291
I knew they had to
break at some point.

436
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,291
Thanks for all of
your help, guys.

437
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,708
Now that they got the message

438
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,666
we just need to make sure
they never forget it.

439
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,833
What they went through today

440
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,916
will only make their
friendship stronger.

441
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,791
Honan Stride's back!
Watch out world!

442
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,750
[HEATH] All right, let's
head back and practice!

443
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,166
[AYUMU, HOZUMI]
What?!

444
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,958
[HEATH]
You heard me!

445
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,458
[NANA]

Go!

450
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,333
[NANA laughs]

451
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,083
[KYOSUKE]
That was near perfect.

452
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:38,375
[HOZUMI] Seriously, what a clean
Relation!

453
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,916
[RIKU]
I think we can do even better.

454
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,416
Yeah, Me, too.

455
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,791
Let's see if we can smooth out
the transition some more.

456
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,291
I thought that one
was spot on.

457
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,500
But let's try again.

458
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,333
[HEATH] Can we get some
practice time, too?!

459
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,083
[HOZUMI laughs]

460
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,208
[NANA]
Hi, Dad.

461
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,583
[JOE]
Well, hello, dear.

462
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,166
[NANA] I've been thinkin'
about your offer

463
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,916
to transfer to Kakyoin.

464
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,208
[JOE]
And?

465
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,958
[NANA]
You're right, Honan Stride

466
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,666
isn't a perfectly polished
team like yours is.

467
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,375
And honestly, we're
probably gonna face

468
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,375
a lot of challenges
because of that.

469
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,833
But I know if we work together

470
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,500
we can overcome any challenge
that comes our way.

471
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:10,791
They're not just my team,
they're like family.

472
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,000
So, thank you for the offer,

473
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,333
but I've decided I'm
gonna stay here.

474
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,500
Honan Stride is where I belong.

475
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,041
[JOE]
I understand.

476
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,875
I'm proud of you for sticking
with a team you believe in.

477
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:22,916
Give 'em all you got.

478
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,750
[NANA]
I will.

479
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh, and Dad?

480
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,333
[JOE]
Mm?

481
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,958
I'll see you at the finals.

482
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,875
[RIKU]
Tomoe!

483
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,041
[RIKU]
Sorry we're late senpai!

484
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,291
--[TAKERU] Yeah, Sorry.
--[HEATH] Where've you been?

485
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,791
[TAKERU, RIKU] There was
a line for the restroom.

486
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,166
[AYUMU] How dare you make
Heathagon, the Beast of Stride,

487
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,166
wait around for you?!

488
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,666
[DAN]
What're you talking about?

489
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,166
[AYUMU] Ooh!  Here's the other
ogre of the team, Danjiro!

490
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,166
Next on "Prinstride,"

491
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,541
"Mecha-Heathagon
vs. King Danjiro!"

492
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,041
It's the fight of
the century! Kaboom!
