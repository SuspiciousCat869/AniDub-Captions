00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,541
[REIJI] The stars are so
bright they're blinding.

3
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,791
But I'll be fine as
long as I have you.

4
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,083
You're the Milky way
to my Andromeda.

5
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,666
Together, we'll spread love
throughout the universe!

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,916
[SHIZUMA] Let's follow our
hearts on a galactic voyage!

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,166
[ASUMA] Take my hand,
and don't let go!

00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,375
[BANTARO]
Our fiery passion

9
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,333
will rip through the
darkness of space.

10
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,750
Just like a shooting
star in the night sky!

11
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,166
[KAEDE]
I'm gonna stick with you

12
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,875
until the end of the time!

00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,250
[TASUKU] Are you up
for a cosmic connection?

14
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:15,041
Only one group can
give it to you.

15
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:18,291
[ALL]
Galaxy Standard, yeah!

16
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,333
[CROWD]
One more song!

17
00:02:56,416 --> 00:03:00,166
One more song! One more song!

18
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,208
One more song!

19
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,625
Well, okay.

20
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,458
One more song, just for you!

00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,458
[CROWD cheers]

22
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,208
What're those guys
doing up there?

23
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,000
As if Saisei High School Stride
wasn't cool enough already,

24
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,916
they're also members of a pop
group. And they're known as--

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,666
[TAKERU]
Galaxy Standard, yeah.

26
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,666
[AYUMU] Stop! You stole
the words outta my mouth!

27
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,000
Can you believe this is the
eighth generation of the group?

28
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,625
It's crazy. I've heard of
Gal-Stan but I had no idea

29
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,000
that the bands' members were
on a high school Stride team.

30
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,583
Not only are they
amazing runners,

31
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:27,916
they're great singers, too!

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,500
Okay, sure, they're
talented and all

33
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,791
but they're not models like us.

34
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,125
[AYUMU]
Yeah, none of them

35
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,416
are plastered on a giant
billboard like our Hozumi!

36
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,541
[HOZUMI]
Ah! Don't remind me!

37
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,375
She promised it was
just a test shot!

38
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,791
There's no need to worry!

39
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,916
Nobody's gonna figure out
that's you dressed up in

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,833
ladies clothing 'cause you
look just like a chick!

41
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,583
Trust me!

42
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,041
[ONLOOKERS]
Huh...? Ah!

43
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:50,250
Riku, how could you?!

44
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,208
[RIKU]
So lemme get this straight,

45
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,250
the Gal-Stan guys gave that
crazy high energy performance,

46
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,750
and now they're gonna race us?

47
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:57,833
[TAKERU]
That's correct.

48
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,458
Talk about stamina!

49
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:00,791
This means we'll
have the advantage

50
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:01,916
because they're gonna be pooped.

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,125
Hey, not good
sportsmanship, dude!

52
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,166
Look, this is just the
beginning, you guys.

53
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,416
Once the Trial Tour starts

54
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,666
we're gonna face some
stiff competition.

55
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,125
And we'll beat 'em all.

56
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,333
Ha, ha. After watching
the guys onstage today,

57
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,958
I'm not so sure we're
gonna beat 'em, Senpai.

58
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:17,833
Hey.

Uh?

00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,458
You care to explain?

61
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,833
Explain what?

00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:22,583

Hey, I met you the
other day, right?

67
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,375
Good to see you!

68
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,666
But what're you doin' here?

69
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,083
Aw, c'mon, man!

70
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,416
Whaddya think I'm doin' here?
I'm in Gal-Stan, duh!

71
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
What?! No way!

72
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,166
How come I didn't
see you up there?

73
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,208
I wasn't front and center
but you couldn't miss me!

74
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,416
[laughs] Look at it
this way Asuma,

you're such a natural you
blend into the background.

[KAEDE]
Hate to break it to ya dude,

77
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,500
but nobody remembers the average
lookin' guy in a boy band,

78
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,458
that's just how it is.

79
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,833
Yeah. He's got a good point.

80
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,333
We'll have to get you a
flashier costume next time.

Sorry man, that was
totally my bad.

Honan Academy Stride, right?

Who, us?

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Yeah. I'm Riku Yagami, runner.

I'm not tryin' to
intimidate you guys,

93
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,666
but I'm a year older than you,
I'm a second year runner.

94
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,583
Whoa, are you kidding
me?! But you--

95
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,083
You look so young, Sir.

like I'm an old man.

you can call me Ban- <i>chan</i> .

aka Mei- <i>chan</i> .

100

Jeez, would you cut it out?

101
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,625
How many times do I have to tell
you to quit calling me that?

102
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,500
It's like some kinda inside joke

103
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,708
you haven't bothered
to tell anyone else.

Hey, my name's Tasuku Seno.

It's nice to meet ya.

00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,625
Now, why're you wearing
your school track suits,

107
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,666
don't you have sponsors?

108
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,458

Uh. Oh, um. We do but, uh...

Hello again.

Uh?!

114

118
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,000
Whoa, did you seriously
go all the way to Kobe

119
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,291
just to get a cell phone charm?!

120
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,500
Kinda.

121
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,083
I decided to pick one up, too.

122
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,083
[door opens]

123
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,916
[HEATH] Okay guys, get in
here for the team meeting.

124
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,250
What up?

125
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,833
Hi, Hasekura.

126
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,541
Wow, long time no see.

127
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,083
I'd hoped to run
into you last year,

128
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,541
but you weren't in any matches.

129
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,416
Heh. Yeah, right.

130
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,333
I swear it's the truth.

131
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,708
[KAEDE]
Excuse me. All right.

132
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,791
That means he's gotta
be here. Where's Kuga?!

133
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,041
[NANA]
Uh?

134
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,291
[HEATH]
Sorry pal, he's not here.

135
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,750
What, did he catch
a cold or somethin'?

136
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,083
[ASUMA]
Whoa, back off, Kaede.

137
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,000
Why're you flippin'
out? Come on.

138
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,125
[KAEDE]
I just don't get it.

139
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,708
They don't stand a
chance without him!

140
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,875
Why isn't he here?

141
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,333
Yeah, sure, he's a
great runner and all,

142
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,750
but Honan Stride can
still win, Kyosuke or not.

143
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,125
[TASUKU] You think so?
I wouldn't be so sure.

144
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,375
I mean, Kuga's the one
who elevated your game.

145
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,625
If you ask me,

146
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,250
you're nothing more than
the B-team without him.

147
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,583
Now Tasuku,

148
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,083
I don't believe anyone did
ask for your opinion.

149
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,125
Heh, heh.

150
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,791
I'm counting on you.
Don't let me down, okay?

151
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:11,916
C'mon, guys.

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,708
[RIKU]
Uh, yeah.

153
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,125
See you on the course.

[AYUMU growls]

157
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,083
Can you get outta the way?

158
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,458
[NANA] Aw, man!

00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,333
[ALL gasps]

474
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,791
But I don't understand.

475
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,416
You know we lost, right?

476
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,791
I am well aware, but Saisei's
sponsor is our rival.

477
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:57,750
[laughing]

478
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,375
[DIANE]
The way they gloated.

479
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,625
It seriously pissed me off!

480
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,166
[STRIDE CLUB whimpers]

481
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,958
[DIANE] If you lose wearing
Runruly, I will kill you all.

482
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:10,250
[RIKU] Whoa! These track
suits are the best ever!

483
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,083
Yeah, and they fit perfectly!

484
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,708
Must be made to order.

485
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,083
I know it's for running

486
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,583
but it'll also up my
intimidation factor in Shogi!

487
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,250
Wow, this is really comfortable!

488
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,458
I don't know about the logo,

489
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,333
I'm worried the fans
won't be able to see it.

490
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,375
It's kinda small.

491
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,208
Have I made the team
captain unhappy?

492
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,041
[HEATH] Shut up!
I was just trying to help!

493
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,500
Who cares about the logo?

494
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,458
You're the ones who're going
to sell the brand for me.

495
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,083
[ALL gasp]

496
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,083
[DIANE] Enough with the gloomy
blues, it was time for a change!

497
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,541
Now Honan Stride is
a crisp, clean white!

498
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,333
The color of new beginnings!

499
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,333
Fitting, don't you think?

500
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,500
And so it starts.

501
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,916
Yeah.

502
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,083
What starts?

503
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,583
I dunno.

504
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,666
[AYUMU laughs]
Only the biggest summer

505
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,833
Stride event in all
of East Japan!

506
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:57,958
Also known as--

507
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,541
[TAKERU]
End of Summer.

508
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,083
[AYUMU] Stop! You stole the
words outta my mouth again!

509
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,166
We call it EOS for short.

510
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,541
It's not somethin' you
can just sign up for.

511
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,000
In order to compete,

512
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,583
you have to pass the trials
and they start next month.

513
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,291
[RIKU]
Next time, I wanna win.

514
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,958
[ALL gasp]

515
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,583
Next time, we're
gonna defeat Saisei!

516
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,625
Uh?

517
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,625
[gasps]

518
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:29,458
[HOZUMI, AYUMU gasp, laugh]

519
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,083
[STRIDE CLUB]
Yeah! You know it!

520
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,625
[KAEDE] Jeez, what's with
all the racket in there?

521
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,041
[TASUKU]
Sounds like a party.

522
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,583
I've never heard of a team
celebrating a loss before.

523
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,500
Honestly, it doesn't
surprise me.

524
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,208
Honan Stride's always
been different.

525
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,708
Looks like they're back.

526
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,500
I don't know if I would
say that, Reiji.

527
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,791
They've got a lot of work to do

528
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,041
before they're a
major contender.

529
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,000
There's a distinct possibility

530
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,458
that they weren't at
their best today

531
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,833
simply because Kuga
wasn't competing.

532
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,291
I wonder why he didn't make it?

533
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:03,000
It must be 'cause he's
suffering from influenza!

534
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,250
[BANTARO]
Y'know, he's got a point,

535
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,958
what if the reason they
didn't do so hot today

536
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,000
is because they didn't
bring their best runner?

537
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,958
Well, I suppose it's possible.

538
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,583
They have a lot of
rookies on their team.

539
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,208
Hasekura was the
only third year.

540
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,500
Kuga's great.

541
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,458
But those first-year
runners aren't bad either.

542
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,125
[KAEDE]
Huh?

543
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,541
One competed in
the Under 15 matches,

544
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:24,833
and as it happens the other
is Tomoe Yagami's brother.

545
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,208
Whoa, seriously? Which guy?

546
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,500
[ASUMA] Heh. The guy that
I ran against today.

547
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,666
[REIJI]
This is going to be fun.

548
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,250
[AYUMU] It's the battle
for the End of Summer!

549
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,208
Determined to overcome his
overwhelming lack of talent,

550
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,041
Ayumu Kadowaki
begins secret training.

551
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,208
When a fierce enemy approaches,
he tackles it head on!

552
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,791
Can he make it to
the end in one piece?

553
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,916
Next on "Prinstride,"
"Farewell Kadowaki"!

554
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,750
[KAEDE]
Not you too, Kadowaki?!

555
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:21,791
Oh, no!
