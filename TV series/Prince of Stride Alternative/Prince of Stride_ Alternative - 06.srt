If every Stride team was

would've happened.

I mean, sure,

147
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,791
it requires trust
between teammates

148
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,375
but that's true of any
sport, not just Stride.

But...

152

I learned something
from getting hurt.

'Cause I wanna help out

00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,000
I can be here for you guys,

160
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,500
to cheer you on
throughout the race.

161
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,291
'Cause Stride's more than
just winning or losing.

162
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,000
There's something
about you guys.

163
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,583
You first years, I mean.
You're helping us to connect.

164
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,625
Y'know, now that
I think about it.

165
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,833
Maybe you're right.

166
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,583
I suppose what I feel
could be considered

167
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,041
an "emotional connection",
after all.

168
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,583
That's what I would call it.

169
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,250
[AYUMU]
All right, I should get going.

170
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,083
I'll be rooting for you
from the stands!

171
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,333
'Kay!

172
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,500
Thank you!

173
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,000
[SHIKI] I may have taunted
them a bit but nothing major.

174
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,208
It's funny how
flustered they get.

175
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,041
[YURI] You go ahead and
play your mind games,

176
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,041
but we're gonna focus
on winning the match.

177
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,625
Yeah well, that's gonna
take some effort

178
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,416
now that Kuga's
back on the team.

179
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,125
There's gotta be a way we can
use him to our advantage.

180
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,625
I'm sure we can find a
wound to rub salt into.

181
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,208
Look, whatever,
I just wanna win this.

182
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,958
All right. Leave it to me.

183
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,458
Ready, Hachiya?

184
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,333
[TETSU]
Let's get this show on the road!

185
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,500
[ANNOUNCER 1B]
On your mark...

186
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,250
Get set...

187
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,125
[TETSU] Dude, it must
be pretty stressful.

188
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,916
Knowing everyone's gonna
compare you to your brother.

189
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,333
[buzzer]

190
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,708
[ANNOUNCER 6A] And both teams
are off to a good start!

191
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,375
[laughs]

192
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,625
[NANA]
Was he laughing?

193
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,041
Why?

194
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:35,916
[NANA]
That's weird.

195
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,750
Why'd Riku start
the race at top speed?

196
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:39,958
[RIKU panting]

197
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,375
[NANA]
He's already out of breath.

198
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,291
What happened?
Something's wrong.

199
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,833
[RIKU grunting]

200
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,791
[RIKU]
This is tough.

201
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,541
[TETSU]
He can't keep this up forever.

202
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,875
He's gonna break.
Any second now.

203
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,250
[RIKU]
This course is endless!

204
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,291
I'm startin' to lose steam!

205
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,833
I know!

206
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,208
[TETSU]
Nice try!

207
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,250
[RIKU]
He dodged it!

208
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,166
[RIKU]
I can't...

209
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,500
[RIKU panting]

210
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,583
[TOMOE]
Aw, c'mon, Riku.

211
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,666
You gotta try harder than that.

212
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,875
[RIKU]
I'm trying as hard as I can!

213
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,291
Trust me!

214
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,291
You're gonna have
to get a lot faster

215
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,750
if you wanna compete in Stride.

216
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,625
You have talent but
you've gotta train.

217
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,833
That's the only way
to get to my level.

218
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,333
[RIKU]
I tried my best.

219
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,958
I gave it my all but it
wasn't enough for him.

220
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,458
He made me feel worthless.

221
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,208
That's why...
I have to prove myself!

222
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,333
[NANA] Keep it up, Riku!
You've got this!

223
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,083
You're almost there!

224
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,541
[NANA]
Heath's ready and waiting!

225
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,916
[NANA]
Go!

226
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,166
[RIKU grunting]
Sorry!

227
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,750
[HEATH]
No apologies needed!

228
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,708
You done good, kid!

229
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,125
[panting]

230
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,625
[HEATH]
This blows!

231
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:13,166
The guy keeps blockin' me!
I can't get around him!

232
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,625
[SHIKI]
I don't wanna brag or anything

233
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,416
but Samejima's
block rate is 100%.

234
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,208
Looks like we're gonna
win this segment, too.

235
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,375
[NANA]
All right, Kyosuke. Get set!

236
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,333
We're behind 0.5 seconds!

237
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,208
[inahles]

238
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,791
[NANA]
I can picture his speed.

239
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,500
I know we can do it.

240
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:33,166
A perfect relation,
just like the video!

241
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:33,875
[NANA]
Go!

242
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:34,958
[SHIKI]
Shishibara.

243
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:35,916
Go!

244
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,750
[KYOSUKE panting]

245
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,833
[SHIKI] Hasekura's endurance
never ceases to amaze me.

246
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,208
[NANA]
Uh.

247
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,750
Most runners would've petered
out by now but he's

248
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,958
giving it everything he's got
right up until the very end.

249
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,125
It's great.

250
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,916
He'd probably win
against anybody else.

251
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,875
But Shishibara's got
a one-track mind.

252
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,000
He's focused passing
the guy in front of him.

253
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,041
[gasps]

254
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:04,125
If they stay at this pace,
they might collide.

255
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,500
[gasps]

256
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,083
[KYOSUKE]
Heath!

257
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,000
[NANA]
Slow down, Heath!

258
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,625
You've gotta hold back!

259
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,500
[HEATH]
Not falling for it!

260
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,166
[NANA gasps]

261
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,166
He's running faster!

262
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,250
[BOTH panting]

263
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,250
[HEATH]
Kyosuke.

264
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,833
I've waited for so long.

265
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:26,291
I was worried I'd never get the
chance to run with you again.

266
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,875
[KYOSUKE] Now that we've
let go of the past...

267
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,583
[HEATH, KYOSUKE] ...we won't
let anyone get in our way!

268
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,375
[HEATH]
Together, I know we can do it.

269
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,291
We're gonna make it
all the way to the top!

270
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,458
[knocking]

271
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,041
I knew that you'd come.

272
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,000
Nice to see ya.

273
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,541
[KYOSUKE]
How're you feeling?

274
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,333
[AYUMU]
Much better than before.

275
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,333
Well, that's good.

276
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,666
It seems Hozumi's

277
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,500
not too keen on you
coming back to Stride.

278
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,500
I guess it's because
he's had to watch Heath

279
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,666
go through the
wringer ever since

280
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,375
that whole mess
went down last year.

281
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,708
He's got some
pent-up frustration.

282
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,208
Yeah.

283
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,625
And, now that I'm hurt,

284
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,708
he feels like he's
responsible somehow.

285
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,541
But it had nothing to
do with him, y'know?

286
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,375
Right.

287
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,125
[AYUMU] There's no way I'm gonna
be able to run this weekend.

288
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,750
I hate to ask you this,
but I'm in a bind.

289
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:40,000
Would you cover
for me at the match?

290
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,416
I'd love to. Sure that's
what you want?

291
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,083
[AYUMU] Yeah, I think
it's good for the team

292
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,291
to have more members.

293
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,791
Just remember one thing, senpai.

294
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,750
Once my injuries are healed up,
I'm takin' back my spot!

295
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,125
[ANNOUNCER 6A] Honan takes
the lead as the teams

296
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:56,833

[SHIKI]
Dammit!

298
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,541
All they had to do was keep
the lead and they blew it!

299
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,083
We'd better not lose. Ah!

300
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,583
[SHIKI]
There you go, Shishibara!

301
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,500
C'mon, I know you can
outrun that loser!

302
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:15,208
Get our lead back! Do whatever
you gotta do to win!

Hey, Kuga- <i>senpai</i> !

304

You've got this!
I believe in you!

my best to make that happen!

[HOZUMI]
I have to Relation with Kyosuke.

311
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,458
I dunno. I don't think I can.

[YURI] Whatcha thinkin' about?
If I were you,

that pea-brain of yours.

00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,625
You think you've
got this in the bag?

316
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,041
Well guess again, girly-boy,

317
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,416
'cause my team's a force
to be reckoned with.

318
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,125
Underestimate us
and you'll regret it.

[NANA]
Okay, Hozumi!

320
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,625
Get set!

321
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,083
[HOZUMI] I can't let my
feelings about Kyosuke

322
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,291
ruin this match for us.
I have to let go of the past.

323
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,791
Heath has waited a long time

324
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,666
to get the chance to
run with him again.

325
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,708
I've gotta do it for him!

326
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,625
[ANNOUNCER 6A] Kuga's making
his way from the outside!

327
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,291
He's right behind Shishibara!

328
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,875
[KYOSUKE] I know this
is hard for you, Hozumi,

329
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,541
but you have to remember...

330
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,791
[HOZUMI]
You didn't leave out of spite.

331
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,750
You were trying to
protect the club.

332
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:23,916
[KYOSUKE]
I'm so thankful

333
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,833
everyone's welcomed
me back to the team.

334
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,791
[HOZUMI]
On one condition...

335
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,958
Don't ever ditch us again!

336
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,125
[KYOSUKE]
I promise.

337
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,250
I'll protect Honan Stride
with my life!

[HOZUMI]
He's got the lead.

340
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,083
I've made it through
the hardest part,

341
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,958
now I've gotta focus on
getting past this guy!

342
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,458
[ANNOUNCER 6A] Look at Himemiya
fly over those obstacles

343
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,125
and Kohinata's right behind him!

344
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,458
It's neck-and-neck, folks!

345
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,083
[YURI] Well played,
girly-boy, well played.

00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,083
[SHIKI grunts] What's the
matter with you, Himemiya?

347
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,541
You were supposed to use
the obstacles to get ahead!

348
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,083
You screwed us!

349
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,000
Can't you idiots see you're
completely ruining my strategy?

350
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,666
You better start following my
commands or we're gonna lose!

351
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,958
Let's not forget that
I'm the Relationer,

352
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,541
you morons can't
even start running

00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,291
until I give you the call!

354
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,833
You've got it easy!

355
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:26,166
All you boneheads have to do
is listen to me and do as I say!

356
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,041
You shouldn't talk to
your team like that.

The hell...?

[NANA] Whether Relationer
or runner, everyone's equal.

When one of us is down,
it affects the entire team.

00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,000
And we work through it,
together.

That's how it's supposed
to be anyway.

362
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,500
You'd understand if you weren't
so preoccupied with winning.

[SHIKI growls]

You've done nothing but belittle
your teammates the whole race.

365
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,208
You should try working with them

instead of barking
orders at them.

Shut up, bitch!

Don't tell me how to do my job!

C'mon, Himemiya!
You've gotta take back the lead!

That's an order from

It's up to us to win!

be a close one, folks,

Both teams killed it but in
the end Ichijokan's anchor

You may think it's
"creepy," but Stride

Huh?! Spare me the lecture.

Your teammates, too.

and to trust each other.

00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,041
[NANA]
Really? That's all it took?

469
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,416
[HOZUMI]
My hands are delicate, okay?

470
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,666
--[HOZUMI, NANA chattering]
--[STRIDE CLUB laughing]

471
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,000
[DIANE]
Mm. Very nice, Kyosuke.

472
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,958
I like this look.
It's wild and sexy!

473
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,333
[PHOTOGRAPHER 6A] Okay,
now straight at the camera.

474
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,916
Wow, he's really
good at this, huh?

475
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,208
I was worried he
might be nervous.

476
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,333
Yeah, it's hard to believe

477
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,250
that this is his
first time modeling.

478
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,041
[TAKERU]
He's a natural.

479
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,541
[HOZUMI]
It's not fair.

480
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,375
I could rock a
"wild and sexy" look.

481
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,083
But here I am stuck in a dress.

482
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,916
[ALL snicker]

483
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:36,833
[NANA]
That one's a perfect fit!

484
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:37,958
[RIKU]
Yeah!

485
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,625
Now we really look
like a winning team!

486
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,166
Here we go,

487
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,583
everybody look at the camera
and give me your biggest smiles!

488
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,125
[RIKU]
This is it, you guys!

489
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,250
Honan Stride's new
chapter starts today!

490
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,166
[KAEDE panting]

491
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,041
I'm so happy you're
still alive, Kuga!

492
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,166
[SHIZUMA]
Would you please calm down?

493
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,333
[KAEDE]
Sorry, I can't help it!

494
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:27,625
Hey, check it out,
it's the Saisei guys.

495
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,000
What's got you
all riled up, Kaede?

496
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,083
[KAEDE]
See who's down there?

497
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,458
It's Kuga in the flesh!

498
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,875
Look at him! He's so awesome!

499
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,000
Is that Riku? Hey, bro!

500
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,500
[RIKU]
What up, Asuma?

501
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,208
It looks like he's back.

502
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,916
[TASUKU]
That's Kyosuke Kuga?

503
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,750
And what makes him
so freakin' special?

504
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:42,833
[BANTARO]
Obviously you've never seen

505
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,166
that old Honan Stride video.

506
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,916
If you had,
you'd totally get it.

507
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,125
I've seen it, but that
was a long time ago.

508
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,291
Who knows if he's
still any good?

509
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,541
Let's keep an eye on them.

510
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,333
This could change things.

511
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:56,333
[REIJI] Yes, indeed.
But it's exciting.

512
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,958
Now that Kuga's
back on the team,

513
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:01,375
Honan may prove to be
a worthy opponent.

514
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,166
I look forward to
competing with them.

515
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,500
[SHIZUMA]
Me, too.

516
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,875
[SHIKI]
Himemiya! Do what I say!

517
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,666
[YURI] Quit yelling,
I need to concentrate!

518
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,750
Stride's like walking
a tight rope without a net!

519
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,291
Our last match was a circus,
with you as the clown.

520
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,416
[AYUMU] Aw Snap!
Next on "Prinstride,"

521
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,416
"The Cruel Angel
Arrives on the Field"!

522
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,083
Do I smell Kua- <i>senpai</i> ?
