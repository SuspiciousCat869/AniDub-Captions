00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,041
[TOMOE]
Hey, Kyosuke.

2
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,333
[KYOSUKE]
Tomoe.

3
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,708
[TOMOE]
I heard a rumor.

4
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:45,625
Is it true you're
running Stride again?

5
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,208
You there?

6
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,375
[KYOSUKE] Yes, but Honan
is the only place for me.

7
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:52,708
[TOMOE] I had a feeling
you'd say that.

8
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:56,000
Anyway, I'm back in Japan and
I'd love to catch up with you.

9
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,791
We should hang out sometime.

10
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,000
Who knows?

11
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,333
Maybe I can convince you
to change your mind.

12
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:04,166
I'll keep in touch. Later.

13
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,000
[HEATH]
It's over.

14
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:44,333
After a week of torture.

15
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,041
The wait for
End of Summer.

16
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,583
Is now over!

17
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:48,458
[HOZUMI]
Yay!

18
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,208
Whatcha gonna do?!

19
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,833
All of a sudden I've
got a serious case

20
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,625
of déjà-vu, you guys.

21
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,750
It's time to determine
which high school team

22
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,500
is the best in East Japan.

23
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,375
We'll be competing against three
other schools in the finals.

24
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,291
[door opens]

25
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,875
[DAN]
Is everybody here?

26
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,458
[RIKU] Whoa, what's in that
giant envelope you got there?

27
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:09,208
The registration documents
for the final tournament.

28
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,750
The first race is a
non-elimination time trial

29
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,958
to determine the pairings
for the final event.

30
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,041
[RIKU] Okay, so we're gonna
be running in the afternoon,

31
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,083
that's cool.

32
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,791
Let's see who we're
racin' against.

33
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,625
Kakyoin High School from Miyagi?

34
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,541
You ever heard of them?

35
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,500
[AYUMU]
Nope, I can't say that I have.

36
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,833
They definitely weren't
in last years' top eight.

37
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,083
In fact, now that
I think about it,

38
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,500
they weren't even
in the top 16.

39
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,916
Maybe they're a brand new team.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,500
Then this'll be an easy win!

41
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,041
[DAN]
Yudan.

42
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,083
[HOZUMI]
Taiteki?

43
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,666
[AYUMU]
Kinmotsu?

44
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,958
Kyoteki!

45
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:39,958
[HOZUMI, AYUMU] How do you keep
coming up with this stuff?!

46
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,041
Guys.

47
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,500
They mean the same
thing, chill out.

48
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,750
It doesn't matter where
they ranked last season.

49
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,083
Teams go through a lot
over the course of a year.

50
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,583
They can rise or fall
significantly in that time.

51
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,416
You all should know that
better than anyone,

52
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,666
look at how far Honan
Stride has come.

53
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,500
Mr. Dan's right, why worry
about our competition?

54
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,125
Let's just focus
on training hard

55
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,541
so we can crush it
at the finals.

56
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,125
Right on, man!

57
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,291
[NANA] This is the competition
that inspired me to join Stride.

58
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,666
I still can't believe I
get to be a part of it!

59
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,958
[RIKU] It's late, why don't
you let me walk you home?

60
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,416
Uh! Are you sure?

61
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,708
I thought you and Takeru
raced home every night?

62
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:15,833
[RIKU]
He'll get over it.

63
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,416
Besides, I'd feel
like a total jerk

64
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,041
if I left a young lady
all alone at this hour.

65
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:23,125
[NANA] Uh. Good work today,
Takeru! Be careful going home.

00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,666

Uh. [gasps]

Hi Dad!

72
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,208
How've you been?

73
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,250
[JOE]
Good.

74
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,625
And what about you?
How's school?

75
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:38,916
Great!

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,750
Thanks for asking.
So is this your new number?

77
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:41,833
Wait, Dad?

78
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,250
Here you go, please sign...

79
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,000
[NANA] I just realized you're
not calling from the US.

80
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,250
[JOE] No, I arrived
in Japan this morning.

81
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,458
I'm not in Tokyo though.

82
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,708
[NANA] How long are
you gonna be here?

83
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,375
I'd love to see you
before you head back.

84
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,291
[JOE]
Actually, I'm here to stay.

85
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,000
I've taken a job at
a high school in Sendai.

86
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,166
Yeah?!

87
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,791
[JOE]
Look, the phone's so impersonal,

88
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,458
I'll give you the details
when I see you.

89
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,500
You know, you should
transfer here.

90
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,208
Oh, I dunno Dad,
this is really sudden.

91
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,916
And I like the school
I'm going to right now.

92

[RIKU]
You comin', Nana?!

Uh. Sorry, I gotta go.

00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,125
The bus is here.
I'll talk to you later.

95
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,125
Was that your dad
who just called you?

96
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,375
[NANA]
Yeah, it's been a while.

97
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,041
He's been living in the US.

98
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,416
When you introduced yourself

99
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,750
and said you were
living with your uncle,

100
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,666
I assumed you'd lost your folks.

101

[NANA]
No, just my mom.

102
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,500
She passed away
when I was little.

103
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,833
I see.

104
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,250
Yeah, It hasn't been easy,
but Dad's back in Japan

00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,708
and this time he's staying.

[TAKERU]
Didn't plan to.

116

[RIKU] We ran into each other
and it just kinda happened.

But brainiac here went
the wrong direction.

knew the way here.

running so confidently!

know where they're going?!

and racing at the same time?

00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,375
[RIKU] Yeah, an easy trip to the
airport turned into an ordeal.

coming in from Frankfurt

00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,625
Believe it or not,
I'll be meeting my team

160
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,041
for the first time in Hokkaido.

161
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,625
Really?!

162
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,916
You've never met your team and
you guys are competing at EOS?!

163
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,625
[TOYA]
Yep, that sounds about right.

164
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,875
I'm super excited!

[CROWD cheering]

00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:47,250
[NANA] Oh, wow!
Check out all the people!

167
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,250
This is perfect.

168
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,750
Not too hot, not too cold.

169
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,416
I'm really diggin'
the north's tempernance.

[AYUMU, HOZUMI laugh]

171
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,708
Okay, it's not a real word,
but you get what I'm sayin'.

172
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,250
[RIKU]
I figured the final tournament

173
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,583
was gonna be off the chain,
but I wasn't expecting all this!

174
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,500
Who knew Stride was
so friggin' popular?!

175
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,500
[TAKERU]
You're overreacting.

176
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,125
[RIKU]
No I'm not, you buzz-kill!

177
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,625
What's with all
the big dudes here?

178
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,000
I mean, they're not super ripped
but they're still massive.

179
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,125
Think they're third years?

180
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,416
[HEATH]
It's not that they're big,

181
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,000
it's that you guys are puny.

182
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,833
You're a lot skinnier than them.
I'm mean, you're tall but thin.

183
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,750
Whatever, we'll
catch up eventually!

184
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,125
Yeah, we're still growing boys!

185
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,583
Um. I think it's time you
face reality, Hozumi.

186
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,958
Whaddya mean?!

187
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,458
I'm staring reality straight
in the face right now!

188
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,375
Be patient, your body will grow
whenever it feels it's ready.

189
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,208
Perhaps it's waiting
for the perfect time

190
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,458
to awaken a hidden power
deep within you.

191
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,416
[HOZUMI]
Uh. Is he trying to cheer me up?

192
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,250
He's right.
In fact, I can see it now!

193
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,083
As Hozumi strives to do his
best in the final tournament

194
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,416
the sleeping dragon
within him...

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,083
...awakens!

00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,583
This power!

Even Bruce Lee's got
nothin' on me!

Nope, that's Kenshiro from
"Fist of the North Star".

No, that's Chan.

Now look what you did,
you gave 'em material;

goofin' off for hours.

[ANNOUNCER 8A]
Saisei High School

210
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,291
pulls off another
perfect Relation!

211
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,333
And now their final
runner, Reiji Suwa,

212
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:16,875
is making his way
toward the finish line!

00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,750
[VOICE 8A]
End of Summer!

[ANNOUNCER 8A]
Saisei wins!

215
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,666
Not only that, but with
near record timing!

216
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,250
At five minutes
and 5.48 seconds,

217
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,458
they're only 0.8 seconds
away from our all-time record.

218
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,500
[HEATH]
Now that was one heck of a race.

219
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,041
Aw, man!

220
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,208
I really hope that we get a
chance to run with Saisei again!

Yeah, me too, it's fun!

Heh. You kids are gutsy
for a bunch of first-years.

224

[ANNOUNCER 8AA] And now,
introducing the two teams

225
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,625
who'll be running
this afternoon!

226

First we have
Kakyoin High School!

[RIKU] Check it out!
That's our opponent!

228
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,916
[ANNOUNCER 8AA] This team
has been completely overhauled

229
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,375
thanks to their new coach!

230
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,125
And while he may
be new to Kakyoin,

231
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,958
he's definitely not
new to Stride.

232
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,208
Meet the man responsible

233
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,500
for making it the popular
sport it is today.

234

[ANNOUNCER 8AA] Let's hear
it for the father of Stride.

was back in the game.

Huh?!

245
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,416
[AYUMU] I thought the shared
last name was a coincidence.

You didn't know your dad
is the "King of Stride"?!

No, I swear!

Look, I know it sounds crazy,

249

but he never really talked
to me about his work.

250

You're so defensive.

00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,166
I'm just a little freaked
out 'cause I didn't know.

I'll be fine.

[ANNOUNCER 8AA] Let's start
the team introductions

255
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,375
with Kakyoin's two
first-year members...!

I met on the plane!

getting a lot of airtime.

258
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,750
Must be the team
to watch this year.

259
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,000
That would explain the hype.

260
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,375
Maybe so, but they seem
pretty sketch to me.

261
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,541
They ditched their old team and
recruited stronger runners.

262
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,500
[ANNOUNCER 8AA]
...Hajime and Ryo are best known

263
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,958
for their mind-blowing
acrobatics!

264
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,291
Here's a little trivia,
when we asked the twins

265
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,458
how they learned to do
all those crazy stunts,

266
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,625
they said they learned them all
while performing in the circus!

267
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,291
And now, Nampei Aoba!

268

Not only is he
Kakyoin's captain,

269
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,958
he's also the only
returning member

270
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,500
of the school's original team.

271

Will he be able to lead
his new teammates to victory?

272
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,791
And last but not least,

00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,416
[HOZUMI]
Hey, Riku...

279
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,958
[RIKU] Eh. Uh, no,
I haven't talked to him.

280

I mean, I heard he was back
in Japan, but that's it.

[RIKU] No way, man!
I'm just surprised, that's all.

Can't say I blame ya
'cause I am too.

284
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,666
I wasn't expecting to see him
here, much less run against him.

00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,958
What are your thoughts, Kyosuke?

286
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,833
[KYOSUKE]
His presence means nothing.

running for my team.

but is everything all right?

Huh?

00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,916
You seem kinda tense.

299
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,250
It's got to be hard
for you to concentrate.

300
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,666
And your mind is noisy,

301
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,291
like an orchestra tuning
their instruments.

This is it.

and do my best today.

I can't let Tomoe distract me.

305

[AMATSU]
Just so you know.

306
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,750
There's no point in
even trying to race me.

307
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,916
I'm pretty much unbeatable.

308
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,083
[TAKERU]
Oh, really?

309
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,541
We'll just see about that.

310
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,500
I suggest you think twice before
you get an attitude with me.

311
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,375
Y'see, I'm not
like everyone else.

312

I don't run, I lead.

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,291
You can try.

314
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,208
[AMATSU]
Ha, ha. Yeah, right!

315
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,958
You may think you're fast but
you don't even know, fool.

316
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,375
Tryin' to one up me is
a waste of your time.

317
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,791
Why don't you go home while
you still have your pride?

318
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,083
I'm not just any
runner I'm the best.

319
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,833
Seriously, you look up the
word "fast" in the dictionary

320
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,625
and you'll find a picture of me.

321
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,791
[TOMOE]
Hey, Kyosuke.

322
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,000
It's been a while since we've
had the chance to run together.

323
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,208
[KYOSUKE]
Yeah.

324
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm surprised you went
back to Honan Stride

325
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,041
after everything that happened.

326
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,208
[KYOSUKE]
We've made amends.

327
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,291
I've decided it's
where I belong.

328
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,833
[TOMOE]
Hm. If you say so.

329
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,250
[TOYA] It's not that
emotions are a bad thing.

330
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,791
You and your teammates are
all battling them right now,

331
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,375
but you have to
work through them.

332
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,333
And you have to do it together.

333
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,500
In my opinion, that's what
Stride's all about.

334
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,125
[MANNOUNCER 8A] Even though
it's only a time trial,

335
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,875
our next race features one of
the most anticipated match-ups

336
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,416
of the entire tournament.

337
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,958
Kakyoin High School,
led by the king himself,

338
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,250
Mr. Joe Sakurai will race
against Honan High School!

339
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,041
The king's daughter,
Nana Sakurai,

340
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:14,750
or shall we say "the princess of
Stride", is Honan's Relationer!

341
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,375
Yeah, That is what
Stride's all about.

342
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,166
I completely agree.

343
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,000
Nice, sounds like the
orchestra's tuned now.

344
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,666
Good luck, Miss Sakurai.

345
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,750
You, too!

Ladies and gentlemen,

the showdown is about to begin!

348
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,458
[NANA] It's inevitable that
my emotions will affect me.

349
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,625
I can't help it,
I have a lot of heart.

Get set...

[NANA] But right now,
we've gotta focus on the race.

We're gonna give it our best!

[TOYA]
Okay, you're good to go.

364

Take the first left.

365
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,333
[NANA] Uh? Why's he sending
him the long way?

366
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,541
Nicely done.

367
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,416
Let's hit from the outside.

368
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,875
[HAJIME]
Understood.

00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,916
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
Hajime Izumino shows off

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,041
his acrobatic skill, jumping
ahead of Riku Yagami!

371
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:22,750
Wait and see...

How's he accelerating
like that?!

374

[NANA]
Riku's 1.2 seconds...

No, make that 1.5

Okay, thanks.

I've gotta try to pick up time.

C'mon, hurry, Riku!

up losing my lead?!

what I'm gonna call?

[HOZUMI] There's no way
I can pass this guy,

but if I can stay
close to him...

400
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,375

Their runner accelerated
toward the end.

doing it on purpose?

first race together.

me was a waste of his time!

to my level of speed!

00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,791
[JOE] Good, 'cause
this is your Daddy's job.

468
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,208
[NANA laughs]

469
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,416
[JOE]
You're gonna be around it a lot.

470
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,083
[NANA]
Huh?

471
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,916
I'm sorry.

472
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,458
Listen to your grandparents
and be a good girl, okay?

473
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,666
I'll call you as often as I can.

474
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,208
Don't go.

475
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,458
Don't leave Daddy,

476
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:17,750
I promise I'll behave if
you take me with you!

477
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,416
I don't want you to go!

478
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,625
Come back!

479
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,958
I wanna go with you!

480
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,041
Don't leave me all alone.

481
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,333
Please, Daddy.

482
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,041
[NANA]
I can't believe it.

483
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,666
After all these years,
we're finally reunited.

484
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,833
Why'd it have to
happen like this?

485
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,333
[TOMOE]
Kyosuke.

486
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,208
I'm sorry I tried to
get you to join us.

487
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,958
I realize it was wrong of me

488
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,458
and I never should've
bothered you with it.

489
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,208
What do you mean?

490
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,750
[TOMOE] Back when you and Heath
and I were all on the same team

491
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,916
it just felt right, you know?

492
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,250
Almost as if our destinies
had been fulfilled.

493
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,708
I honestly thought
the three of us

494
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,708
had created the
ideal Stride team.

495
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,625
But now I know better.

496
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,125
Even though we worked
well together,

497
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,041
we never really connected.

498
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,541
Yes, we all wanted to win,

499
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,708
but we had different
reasons driving us.

500
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,833
So this is it.

501
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,291
I've gotta say goodbye, Kyosuke.

502
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,708
Dammit!

503
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,083
What's with the long faces?
Cut it out, you guys!

504
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,916
At least this was just
a time trial, right?

505
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,041
Woo-hoo!
We're still in the game!

506
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,291
Yeah! We'll go home, train,
and then crush 'em

507
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,125
in the final tournament!

508
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,333
[AYUMU sighs]

509
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,708
[DAN]
Kadowaki is absolutely right.

510
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,083
Don't dwell on this
loss start thinking ahead.

511
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,625
Find your weaknesses and conquer
them before the next match.

512
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,458
Understood?

513
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,625
[STRIDE CLUB]
Yes, Sir.

514
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,833
Where are you going?

515
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,583
None of your business.

516
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,083
[TAKERU]
There's no time to be depressed.

517
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,333
We have to get back
to our train--

518
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,291
[RIKU]
Shut up!

519
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,208
I don't wanna hear it!

520
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,916
You're just like Tomoe.

521
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,083
[door creaks]

522
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,666
[RIKU]
We always ran together.

523
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,708
More like, I was always
chasing his back.

524
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,750
[RIKU] I tried to catch up
to him but I couldn't do it.

525
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,250
I thought if I trained
hard enough,

526
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:43,166
then one day I'd
be as fast as him.

527
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,875
But I was wrong.

528
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:49,083
No matter how much I ran,
I could never catch up with him.

529
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,583
He was too fast.

530
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,666
I started to think that maybe
there was something wrong

531
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,875
with my brother.

532
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,916
Nothing stopped him
from training,

533
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,166
not even the pouring rain.
He'd run for hours soaking wet.

534
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,833
I thought he had some
kinda sick obsession.

535
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,750
How else could you explain it?

536
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:11,416
[TOMOE]
C'mon Riku, let's go running.

537
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,916
[RIKU]
No thanks.

538
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,583
[TOMOE]
Hey, What's the matter?

539
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:18,125
[RIKU] Nothing, it's just...
running with you isn't fun.

540
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,250
I don't wanna do it anymore.

541
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,625
You can't give up now,
you've got talent but y--

542
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:25,125
[RIKU] You've taken all
the fun out if it, Tomoe!

543
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:28,250
Look, I don't wanna
do Stride anymore!

544
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,708
I never wanted to.

545
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,208
You forced me.

546
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:36,083
[TOMOE gasps]
I understand.

547
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,750
I'm sorry I pushed it on you.

548
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,000
[TOMOE]
Riku.

549
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,416
[RIKU gasps]

550
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,500
[NANA]
Oh no, I forgot the onigiri!

551
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,041
[RIKU] Aw man, I was
ready to chow down!

552
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,000
[AYUMU]
Watch your back, Riku!

553
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,333
[RIKU] What?!

554
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:14,750
[HOZUMI] I don't think you
understand how desperate

555
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,208
Ayumu is to get his hands
on that delicious onigiri!

556
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,750
[AYUMU]
It will be mine!

557
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,208
Next on "Prinstride," "We all
run for the giant onigiri"!

558
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,958
[STRIDE CLUB]
Yummy!
