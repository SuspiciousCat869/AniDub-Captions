I think the bandages do a lot
for my rugged good looks!

160
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,500
They sure do.

161
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,291
I'm glad you're feeling better.

162
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,333
Who knows? You may be
running by the weekend!

163
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,125
[HEATH] Something happened
beginning of last year

164
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,125
that almost shut down the club.

165
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,750
A lot of our members
ended up bailing.

166
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,000
Not that I blame 'em.

167
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,333
We were barely hangin'
on by a thread.

168
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,208
Hozumi took it upon himself
to keep things rolling,

169
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,083
and talked Ayumu into joining.

170
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,500
[NANA]
Oh, I see.

171
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,125
That must be when he recruited
him from the Shogi Club.

172
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,541
Well back in those days

173
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,250
we didn't even have a
Shogi Club. Ayumu would just

174
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,458
play by himself wherever
he found an empty spot.

175
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,875
[NANA, RIKU]
By himself?

176
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,291
[HEATH]
Heh. Yeah, so we made a deal.

177
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,750
We joined each other's clubs
in order to keep them goin'.

178
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,750
[RIKU]
That sounds pretty desperate.

179
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,041
[HEATH]
Didn't matter to us.

180
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,041
We were just happy
to have a team at all.

181
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,583
And Ayumu dedicated
himself to the training.

182
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,166
[TAKERU]
He had to have.

183
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,000
There's no way Shogi could've
prepared his body for Stride.

184
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:19,625
[HEATH laughs] True and we had
to prepare our minds for Shogi.

185
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:23,125
[AYUMU grunts]
It's harder with my left hand.

186
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,250
[HOZUMI]
Ayumu, this is all my fault.

187
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,208
I'm so sorry.

188
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,625
Why're you taking the blame?

189
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,541
I'm the one who tried
the fancy footwork.

190
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,583
[HOZUMI]
You wouldn't have gotten hurt

191
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,625
if I hadn't dragged
you into this!

192
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,708
It was wrong.

193
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,708
You didn't wanna join
the Stride Club!

194
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,375
[NANA]
I get it now.

195
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,291
Hozumi doesn't want Kuga- <i>senpai</i>

196
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,416
on the team 'cause
Stride takes trust,

197
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,416
and he can't trust him
after the whole KGB thing.

198
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,541
[TAKERU, RIKU]
Huh?

199
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,250
I'll bet he's also
blaming himself

200
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,666
for Ayumu's injuries,

201
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,125
since he's the one who
got him to join Stride.

202
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,791
[RIKU]
It's totally possible.

203
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,375
Sure sounds like him. Yeah.

204
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:02,500
Hate to think he'd feel guilty
for bringin' his buddy in.

205
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,750
[AYUMU]
Don't you have practice today?

206
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,125
[HOZUMI]
I skipped it.

207
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,000
But shouldn't you be scouting?

208
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,166
You need another runner.

209
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,125
[HOZUMI]
I only wanna run with you.

210
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,625
'Fraid I can't right now.
I mean, look at me.

211
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,458
[HOZUMI]
Aw, c'mon!

212
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,291
Stay positive! 'Kay?

213
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,916
For all we know your muscles are
healing at super-human speeds

214
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,458
and you'll end up
faster than all of us--

215
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,083
[AYUMU]
Hozumi.

216
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,958
I think it's time we stop
lying to ourselves.

217
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,166
Even if a miracle happened,
I'm just not cut out for it.

218
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,833
I tried, but the team
deserves to win.

219
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,375
We need to win the next race.

220
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:41,916
But no matter what, you and
I will always be teammates.

221
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,583
[TAKERU]
He wasn't forced to join.

222
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,625
[NANA, RIKU, HEATH gasp]

223
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,041
He chose to.

224
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,958
Ayumu's legs prove that
he's dedicated to his training.

225
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,500
You've got a point.

226
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,000
You're a palm reader.

227
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,583
That's cool. 'Cept it's legs.

228
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,958
[TAKERU] Let's go.
We're wasting our time here.

229
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,250
Uh.  You're right!

230
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,916
[NANA]
Go where?

231
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,291
[RIKU] Hmm. We should probably
go find Hozumi- <i>senpai</i> .

232
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,416
We can't let him go
through this all on his own.

233
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,916
We need to let him know
that his teammates

234
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,041
will always have his back.

235
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,333
[NANA]
Great idea!

236
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,916
Wait, you guys don't even know--

237
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,500
[RIKU] Hold up, does anybody
even know where he went?

238
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,750
[HEATH sighs]

239
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,416
I'd like to thank you, Hozumi.

240
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,916
I'm really grateful
that you invited me

241
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,375
to join the Stride Club.

242
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,625
Sure, it's a challenge

243
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,375
but I love it so much
that I wanna protect it

244
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,500
just as much as you do.

245
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:32,875
Do the right thing for the club.
Work hard, so we'll win.

246
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,750
[HOZUMI]
Ayumu...

247
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,208
[knocking]

248
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,208
[AYUMU]
Mm? Come in!

249
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,541
Hey! There you are!

250
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,833
Why look, my guild has
come to pay homage...!

251
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,250
[RIKU]
We've been looking everywhere!

252
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,375
We finally had to ask Heath..

253
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,916
[AYUMU]
...I'm not crying.

254
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,083
I'm sorry.

255
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,125
But I still stand
by what I said earlier.

256
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,083
[RIKU]
And we're fine with that!

257
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,041
We're not here to convince
you to let him join.

258
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,750
We wanna know how you're
feeling, that's all.

259
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,375
In Stride when someone's injured

260
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,750
the rest of the team
suffers with them.

261
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:10,000
I can't run with Kyosuke,
not after he betrayed us.

262
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,791
And if we had to run together,
we'd never win.

263
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,583
Our team trusted him
wholeheartedly,

264
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,708
and then he went and
hurt Heath's ankle!

265
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,625
There's no way I could put
my trust in him again.

266
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,625
So that's why.

267
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,916
[HOZUMI] Nearly everyone quit
the team after the KGB incident.

268
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,375
Heath did everything he could
to keep the club alive

269
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,833
even though it was on
the brink of shutting down.

270
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,083
He wanted to run again

271
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,583
but it took his ankle
a whole year to heal!

272
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,833
It was all Kyosuke's fault!

275
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,166
[HOZUMI] That's why I'm
not okay with him joining.

276
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,833
He chose his path.

277
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:53,208
I can't forget what he did
just because we need help.

278
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:57,208
It's just... not right.

279
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,083
Thank you for telling
us what happened.

280
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,333
I suppose we've got no choice.

281
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,416
We'll simply have to
find someone else.

About my ankle.

[HOZUMI, NANA gasp]

The truth is... he saved us.

290
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,000
Kyosuke sacrificed
everything for Stride.

That's not what we heard.

Why, is it some kinda secret?

I guess you could say that,

if the wrong people
get a hold of the truth,

299
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,791
there's a good chance our

I'm sorry, Hozumi.

303
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,791
I shoulda told you
but I kept it to myself

304
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,083
in order to protect the club.

305
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:53,750
Here's the real story
of the KGB incident.

306
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,500
[HEATH]
Up until last year,

307
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,875
Honan Stride had
tons of members.

308
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,708
And almost all of them
were third-year students.

309
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,833
When Mr. Dan officially
became coach

310
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,333
he decided to change
things up a little.

311
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,708
He put me, Kyosuke, and
Tomoe on the starting roster

312
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,250
even though we were

00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,125
please come to the East
Square Headquarters Tent

470
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,375
or you will be ineligible
to participate. All teams...

471
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,708
Um, Honan Academy?

472
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,083
We're gonna need your
running order now, please.

473
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:24,958
[NANA]
It's coming!

474
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,375
We just need a little more time.

475
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:35,541
Well, then. I guess that's that.

476
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,916
[RIKU gasps]

477
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The wind's dust attack
penetrates lens armor.

478
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,041
The pain is super effective!

479
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,083
[RIKU, NANA gasp]

480
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,458
[ALL gasp]

481
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,958
Dude, you're late.

482
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,000
Welcome back.

483
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,041
Kyosuke Kuga,
third-year student.

484
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,000
I'd like to sign up for the
Stride Club starting today.

485
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,458
[RIKU, AYUMU laugh]

486
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,875
Kyosuke!

[DAN]
<i>Ichiro Junpuu</i> .

488
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,791
[RIKU] Hey, Cap, aren't you
supposed to be studying

489
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:09,916
for college entrance exams?

490
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
[HEATH]
Uhh, well, Riku, I--

491
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:11,791
[TAKERU]
It's not important.

492
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,333
[RIKU]
Nobody asked you!

493
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:14,750
[TAKERU] We shouldn't focus
on anything but End of Summer.

494
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,000
[KYOSUKE]
I agree.

495
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,291
Let tomorrow's troubles
blow in with the wind.

496
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,833
[RIKU] Sounds like you're
avoiding exams, too.

497
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,083
Next on "Prinstride," "Kyosuke
of the Valley of the Wind"!

00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:21,958
[TAKERU]
