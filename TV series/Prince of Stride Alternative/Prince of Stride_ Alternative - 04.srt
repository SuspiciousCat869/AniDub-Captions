[DAN] The Trial Tour
begins next Sunday.

2
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,083
Interested in knowing
your first opponent?

3
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,833
It's Mihashi High School.

4
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,000
[AYUMU]
Oh really?

5
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:48,958
Those ichthyomaniacs.

6
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,041
Every year, the Mihashi
High School Stride team

7
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:54,000
flies giant carp streamers
during Boys' day festivities!

8
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,708
Way to go!
You tell 'em, 'Mu!

9
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,458
[RIKU] Isn't that what
you're supposed to do?

10
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,666
[AYUMU] Yeah, but Mihashi's
are ginormous because they're

11
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,916
from Saitama which is
the number one manufacturer

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,291
of carp streamers in Japan!

13
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,541
[HOZUMI]
That's right!

14
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,250
You schooled them,
Prime Minister of Trivia!

15
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,833
The first match
of the Trial Tour

16
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,541
is gonna take place in Atami.

17
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:13,291
Whoa! No way. Ha! Seriously?!

18
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:16,083
Awesome! Atami's a
sweet hot springs resort!

19
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,875
[DAN clears throat]
<i>Yudan Taiteki</i> .

20
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:21,750
Remember, our focus
is the EOS trials.

21
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,166
This is Hasekura's
last chance to compete.

22
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,750
[RIKU, AYUMU]
Uh.

23
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,416
[DAN] We can't afford to slip
up like we did against Saisei.

24
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,916
[RIKU, AYUMU groan]

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,166
Aw, c'mon, you guys,
what's with the long faces?

26
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,500
You're bringin' the room down.

27
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,083
It's never too late
to turn things around.

28
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,416
[AYUMU grunting]
Yeah!

29
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,958
One failure will not defeat me!

30
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,375
All Shogi pieces move forward!

31
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,375
[HOZUMI] Right behind ya,

[HEATH grunts]

33
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,750
Whoa, that was killer, man!

34
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,250
Thanks. That's called the Vault.

35
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,916
It's one of the most basic
moves used to clear obstacles.

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,208
Ooh, my turn! Watch!

37
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,333
Oh, wow!

38
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,666
Dang! Did you see that?

39
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,000
He hopped right over that
bar like it was nothin'!

40
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,666
[AYUMU chuckles]
That particular move

41
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,541
is what's known as
the Monkey Vault.

42
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,333
It's challenging because
it requires the runner

43
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,291
to jump higher
than other Vaults.

44
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,958
There's the Kong Vault,
the Dash Vault,

45
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,083
the Pop Vault, the Gate
Vault, the Sky Vault,

46
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,625
the Reverse Vault, the...

47
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,041
[RIKU] Why don't you get out
there and show us one, senpai?

48
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,375
[gasps] Uh, yeah sure,
that's a great idea!

49
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,541
I'd be happy to!

50
00:03:56,625 --> 00:04:00,333
What better way is there
for you to learn?

51
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,958
[AYUMU inahles, exhales]

52
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,750
[AYUMU gasps]

53
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,416
[RIKU]
That was pretty solid!

54
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,416
Too slow.

55
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,625
[RIKU, NANA]
Uh.

56
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,375
Jumps like that
won't win matches.

57
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,083
You don't have to be
such a jerk about it!

58
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,916
[HOZUMI]
All right! Nice one, Takeru!

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,500
That was great but
it'd look cooler

60
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,125
if you pull your knees
in when you jump.

61
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,708
As long as it's
fast and accurate,

62
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,333
I couldn't care less
whether it "looks cool."

63
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,375
[HEATH] Heh. Always has a
smart-ass remark, doesn't he?

64
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,666
[TAKERU] Stride is a speed
sport, not the circus.

65
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,458
[HEATH] Okay, let's split up and
get in some solo practice time!

66
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,708
Don't hurt yourselves!

67
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,333
--[HOZUMI] We won't!
--[NANA] Right!

68
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,833
[HEATH] Hey, Hozumi,
be sure to lock up, all right?

69
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,250
[HOZUMI]
You got it.

70
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,666
I'll leave the keys
out for Takeru

71
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,041
since he'll probably be
the last one to leave.

72
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,000
[AYUMU]
Hozumi.

73
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,458
[HOZUMI]
Mm? Hey, what's up?

74
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,500
You're not gonna wear
that thing home, are you?

75
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,375
Help me conquer my fear
of course obstacles.

76
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,166
[HOZUMI]
What, right now?

77
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,083
Yeah.

78
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:10,791
Uh! Okay! Let's do it!

79
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,291
[HOZUMI]
You gotta go full speed!

80
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,375
There ya go! Don't let
your fear get to you!

81
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,791
Don't stop before the jump!

82
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:21,083
Keep your focus on moving
forward, not the obstacle!

83
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,250
[AYUMU]
I'll try it again.

84
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,791
[AYUMU screams]

85
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,208

[AYUMU yelps]

87
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,541
[HOZUMI]
You all right?

88
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:48,125
[AYUMU sighs]
Yeah, I'm fine.

89
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,875
I think I was on to
something that time!

90
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,458
Really? Good!

91
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,041
Then I say we keep at it until
you finally get it down perfect!

92
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,458
[AYUMU]
Okay!

93
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,000
[HOZUMI] One hundred more
tries should do the trick!

94
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:02,333
[AYUMU] Nah! How about we start
at 50 and see what happens?

95
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,583
[RIKU]
I got a proposition for ya, Cap.

96
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,250
Please? Lemme try your bento
and I'll let you try mine.

97
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,916
[HEATH]
Sure, you got a deal, man.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,041
[RIKU] Aw yeah,
seafood's the way to go.

99
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,750
[HEATH]
Mm! The beef's pretty good.

100
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,458
Okay, trade me back.
Hey, cut it out!

101
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,833
Salmon roe's my favorite!

102
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,791
I said you could try it,
not eat it all!

103
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,666
I can't help it, it's so tasty!

104
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,416
[HEATH growls, sighs]
He barely left me any.

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,750
Hey, Takeru. Gonna let me
try your bento, too?

106
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,041
You know what,
never mind, I'm good.

107
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,750
I'm just gonna stick
with what I've got.

108
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:50,916
[TAKERU]
Go ahead and take a piece.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,916
You don't have to share yours.

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,250
[RIKU]
Thanks, but no thanks.

111
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,750
If you're serious
about End of Summer

112
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,333
you'll start eating more
white meat and lean protein.

113
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,791
The fat content of
white meat chicken

114
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,625
is a low 0.8 grams per
every 100 grams,

115
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,166
and it has 23 grams of protein.

116
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,916
Thigh meat has 14 grams of fat
in the same amount of meat,

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,291
and has only 19
grams of protein.

118
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,875
A sirloin steak has
22 grams of protein

119
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,625
but it also has a
whopping 24 grams of fat.

120
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,208
Pork belly has a mere
14 grams of protein

121
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,666
and a ridiculous
35 grams of fat.

122
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,000
Saury has 19 grams of protein
and 25 grams of fat.

123
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,083
You like instant
noodles, right? Well...

124
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,041
How does he know
all that stuff?

125
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,625
It's almost as if he's memorized
the nutritional values

126
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,708
of every food he's
ever put in his mouth.

127
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,666
I know that we should
eat well and train hard,

128
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,291
but in the end
it's all up to fate.

129
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,333
C'est la vie.

130
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,416
Well, the way you've
been training,

131
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,625
you're gonna kick fate's butt!

132
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,041
Atami! Ha, ha, ha!

133
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:43,916
Uh?

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,333
Check it out! A foot bath!

135
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,750
[HOZUMI]
Sweet!

136
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,375
[RIKU] I'm gonna stick my
feet in, who's with me?

137
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,541
You down, Hozumi?

138
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,958
Yeah, I'm all about it.

139
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,541
What could it hurt? I mean,

140
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,875
soaking our feet is basically
the same as a pre-match warm-up!

141
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:55,916
If you want a warm-up,

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,958
we could always
sprint to the hotel.

143
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:57,833
[HOZUMI, RIKU, AYUMU]
Uh!

144
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,083
Why bother with just your feet?

145
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,083
C'mon, a quick run will
warm-up your whole body.

146
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,708
"A quick run"?
But the hotel's far away!

147
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,458
[AYUMU, HOZUMI]
Uh! He's doing it!

148
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,583
Oh, it's on!

149
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,750
Last one there buys
everybody drinks!

150
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,875
The first to play is
usually the first to win!

151
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:12,708
[HOZUMI]
Wait for me!

152
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:13,666
So we're doing this?!

153
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,416
Hey!

154
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,541
[NANA laughs]
The guys are really excited.

00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,000
I hope they're prepared,

'cause this first to play
may not be the first to win.

[NANA]
Huh?

158
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,291
[RIKU] An open-air bath?!
This is so awesome! Ha, ha!

Ahh! Aw, yeah, this'll do.

162
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,708
We ran all the way here
from the station,

163
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,000
and then ran to
check out the course.

[RIKU gasping, yelps]

168
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,000
Nice deltoids, Yagami.

169
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,166
[RIKU]
Ah! Let go!

170
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,708
[TAKERU] Your pectoralis
major needs work.

171
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,083
You get your filthy hands
off of me, ya perv!

172

Would you quit screamin'?
You're gonna get us in trouble.

173
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,375
[TAKERU]
I didn't know you were here.

174
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,666
Your femoral muscles
are quite impressive!

175
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,916
So strong.

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,083
[HEATH] Knock it off, Takeru!
I'm warnin' ya!

177
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,208
Uh!

[gasps] No! Please
Don't come in here!

179
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,166
I don't have the
muscles they do!

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,666
[HEATH]
Get him off of Hozumi!

181
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,583
[RIKU]
Quit bein' a creep, Takeru!

182
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,125
What are they doing over there?

183
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,083
[HEATH] Well, you guys,
it all starts tomorrow.

184
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,541
It should be fun,

185
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:27,083
but we gotta focus 'cause
this year's course is tough.

186
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,208
Be careful out there.
Don't wanna get hurt.

187
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,625
I'm gettin' worried about Ayumu.

188
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,333
Shouldn't he be back by now?

189
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,583
[HEATH] Depends on how far
he went to get us drinks.

190
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,791
[NANA] I don't wanna step
on your toes or anything.

191
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,500
But I was thinking it might
be smart to double-check

192
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,166
the running order
before the match starts.

193
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,333
If you want to.

194
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,625
[HEATH]
Nah, there's no need.

195
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:03,791
We've been training
in that order

196
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,166
since the last competition.

197
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,583
[gasps] Long time no see.

198
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,041
I hope you guys will
be gentle with us today.

199
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,500
Meet Yu Kamoda.

200
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,333
He's Mihashi's Relationer.

201
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,166
And this is ours, Nana Sakurai.

202
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,583
[YU]
Uh? But she's a girl.

203
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,166
Yeah, got a problem with that?

204
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,208
Forgive me for sounding rude, it
certainly wasn't my intention.

205
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,916
I'm just surprised, that's all.

206
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,833
I'm sorry, Miss.

207
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,375
Oh. No prob.

208
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,125
Y'know, if you're feeling guilty
you could always make it up

209
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,166
to us by sharing
your running order.

210
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,541
C'mon, Kamoda.

211
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,750
You're my buddy, aren't ya?

212
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,541
Of course I am!
But I can't do that.

213
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,291
[HEATH laughs] I was just
messin' around with you, man!

214
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,000
You could've given me
a fake running order

215
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,333
and I wouldn't have
known any better.

216
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,666
I swear, you haven't
changed one bit, have you?

217
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,875
I've never been good
at that kinda stuff.

218
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,125
Kei's the one who's always
got the snappy comebacks.

219
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,041
You ready, Bro?
Quit yammering and get to work.

220
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,750
Did you finish checking
the equipment?

221
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,583
No, not yet. Sorry.
I'll do it right now.

222
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,916
That's Kei Kamoda.

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,958
Team captain and
Yu's little brother.

224
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,000
[NANA] The younger
brother's the captain?

225
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,791
Hello, I'm Nana Sakurai.
It's nice to meet you.

226
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,958
I heard you guys got beat
by Saisei at the last match.

227
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,500
Looks like Honan's reign
is officially over.

228
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,000
C'mon, let's go, Yu.

229
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,500
[YU]
Uh...

230
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,583
[HEATH] You really oughta teach
him to respect his elders.

231
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,541
Our team's strategy has
always been runner-centric.

232
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,458
So I'm really nothin'
but a figurehead.

I gotta win today.

00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,791
Not just for me,

249
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,250
but for my little sister
who's desperately ill.

250
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,416
What?

251
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,833
[AYUMU]
She's on death's door.

252
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,166
The only thing that could
save her now is surgery,

253
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,416
but she's too scared
to go through with it.

"I'm so scared, big brother!"

[HOZUMI]
He doesn't even have a sister!

256

"I'll make a deal with you, Sis.

If I win this match,
will you have the surgery?"

259
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,833
She agreed.

260
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,083

00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,541

He bought it!

262
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,666
No offense, but I have
to kick your butt today.

263
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,833
It's to save my sister!

fight for your little sis!

run as fast as I can

469
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,583
I'm up for another race,
how 'bout you?

470
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,208
I'm really sorry, Kei.

471
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,375
I know I let you down.

472
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,375
Would you stop
apologizing all the time?!

473
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,333
I'll try.

474
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,083
I wish I was a
better Relationer.

475
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,125
I'm no good at it.

476
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,083
Now you know that's not true.

477
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,083
[gasps]

478
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,291
[KEI] You could be
a great Relationer,

479
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,416
but I never gave you the chance.

480
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,625
I'm sorry.

481
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:40,916
Can we just start over?

482
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,708
I won't get in your way
anymore, I promise.

483
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,875
I wanna see you reach
your full potential.

484
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,791
'Course we can. Thanks.

485
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,541
[TOMOE]
Kyosuke, long time no talk.

486
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,750
I know this is outta
the blue, but

487
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,541
I was thinkin' maybe we
should get back in action.

488
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,416
Sorry, but I no longer
have the right

489
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,041
to participate in Stride.

490
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,916
[TOMOE]
Oh, gimme a break.

491
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,708
You never change, do ya?

492
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:24,500
I gotta admit, I've always
liked that about you.

493
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,625
I'm comin' back to Japan soon.

494
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,958
I'll get in touch with
you when I'm home.

495
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,916
Okay, well... Take care.

496
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,291
[NOBUHIKO]
I hope your sister's surgery

497
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:10,583
saves her life, Kadowaki!

498
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,125
[AYUMU]
Thanks, Nagatsuka! Careful!

499
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,083
I'm in a lot of pain!

500
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,458
[NOBUHIKO]
Are you sick, too?!

501
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,083
[AYUMU] No! Listen, my
sister's a delicate flower.

502
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,416
--[NOBUHIKO] In the shower?
--[AYUMU] Ina Bauer!

503
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,791
[HOZUMI]
Next on "Prinstride,"

504
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,750
"Ayumu's Sister is Probably
a German Figure Skater"!

505
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,000
Hurry and get better, man!
