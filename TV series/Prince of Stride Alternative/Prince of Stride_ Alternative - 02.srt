00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,291
"Don't hesitate 'cause when
the wind feels you up,

163
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,125
you should start to run."
Somethin' like that.

164
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,333
[HEATH]
Wow, dude.

165
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,000
You should probably
take notes next time.

166
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:10,083
Just so you all know, we
still need a sponsor, guys.

167
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,083
What? A sponsor?

168
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,083
But why?

169
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,500
'Cause It takes a lot of moolah

170
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,750
to get these competitions
up and running.

171
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,458
Course setup, travelling costs,

172
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,250
and that's just the
tip of the iceberg.

173
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,250
There's no way a school
club could foot the bill...

174
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:21,916
[HOZUMI]
Hey thanks, Ayumu.

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,208
Ohh...

176
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,708
Wow, that is a lot.

177
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,291
Do ya think a past
sponsor would help us?

178
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,583
Unfortunately, they're
sponsoring another team now.

179
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:36,541
Only one school per backer.
That's a <i>Fubun Ritsu</i> .

180
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,666
[DAN]
Hm?

181
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,291
[NANA, RIKU]
Uh...

182
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,125
<i>Fubun Ritsu</i> , like three is
a crowd but two is a date.

183
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,958
[RIKU, NANA laugh]

184
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,500
A single school can have
multiple sponsors though!

185
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,458
I'm bettin' these pretty boys
don't need too much help!

186
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,000
Heck yeah,

187
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,708
you better believe Saisei High
School is rolling in dough!

188
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,583
[AYUMU] With their
team's celebrity status,

189
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,583
sponsors probably
throw money at 'em!

190
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,500
Here's an idea!

191
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,000
We could gain fame...

192
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,083
by conquering the world of
Shogi!

193
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,500
[laughs]

194
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,750
Do you think we could really
get famous that way?

195
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:06,750
Well, I dunno, maybe.

196
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:07,791
[TAKERU]
I won't play Shogi.

197
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,666
[AYUMU]
Oh! He denied me again!

198
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,333
You tell him, Takeru!

199
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,250
[RIKU]
So, you got any other ideas?

200
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,291
[HOZUMI]
Uh...

201
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,583
[AYUMU]
It'd be easier without KGB.

202
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,083
[NANA]
What's KGB?

203
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,625
[RIKU]
Never heard of it.

204
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:24,166
I shall explain! KGB stands
for Kuga Going B--

205
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,083
Take this!
My Ninja Cat Paw Hell Stab!

206
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,166
[ALL gasp]
You okay, Senpai?

207
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,875
Hey, we don't talk about that.

208
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:30,791
[ALL]
Uh?

209
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,375
[AYUMU gasping]
Well, I suppose.

210
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,541
Given the circumstances
of our current situation,

211
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,958
we could always
reach out to D's.

212
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,958
[HEATH sighs]

213
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,916
Who is... D's?

214
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,416
[HEATH]
D's International.

215
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,375
A fashion company that owns
Hercules, Aurora, and JSTT.

216
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,375
You know, stores like that.

217
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,083
[gasps]

218
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:51,958
Whoa, I've hearda them!

219
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,041
[TAKERU]
Who?

220
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,250
[NANA] They have stores
in my home-town!

221
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,541
I have a purse from there!

222
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,250
[HEATH]
I don't wanna ask.

223
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,458
Do you think there's a chance

224
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,125
they'd actually want
to sponsor us?

225
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,208
[HOZUMI]
Uh. Probably when you consider

226
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,166
that Heath's sister owns
the entire company.

227
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,916
Wow, they really would?

228
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,958
[NANA, RIKU]
Huh?!

229
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,041
Heath's sister owns
the company?!

230
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,833
Yeah, the "D" in "D's"
stands for Diane Hasekura.

231
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,375
[HEATH]
No, it stands for demon.

232
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,000
[RIKU] Wait, do you even
know where to find her?!

233
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,291
[TAKERU]
No.

234
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,583
C'mon, senpai. Aren't you
gonna come with us?

235
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,500
Can ya just gimme a
second to think it over?

236
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:26,416
Hasekura, I understand
you have reservations.

237
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,500
But, <i>Sokudan Sokketsu</i> .

238
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:34,291
[sighs] I guess we have
no other options, huh?

239
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,208
[DIANE]
Of course.

240
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,750
[HOZUMI, AYUMU]
That was quick!

241
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,916
[DIANE] You can't apply for a
match without a sponsorship.

242
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,875
I signed the paperwork
weeks ago.

243
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,166

Huh?!

And it's signed by Mr. Dan!

248
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,833
Now, there is one condition.

00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,416
You have to win
the Spring Festival

250
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,458
or I'll revoke your sponsorship.

251
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,458
'Cause the D's brand
is for winners.

Sure, sis, you got it.

That was quick!

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,166
Oh, and it goes without saying
you'll have to model for me.

00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,541
Lucky us.

00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,166
Guess I shoulda seen
that one comin'.

Your timing's perfect.

Just a few more and we got it!

Quite an upgrade from a
sweaty track suit, right?

[NANA] Wow, Takeru!
You're really good at this!

Y'know you don't have to.

a lot of work to do!

Nah, she's just a control freak.

She always has to do
everything herself.

She's even her own bodyguard.

needs one anyway!

anything he's bad at?

He's had a lot of practice;

he's modeled since he was a kid.

My brother.

Uh, yes ma'am!

[DIANE]
Why didn't he come along today?

He decided to study abroad,
so he's in the US right now.

Is that so?

Yeah, he doesn't go
to Honan anymore.

That's too bad.

He would've been
perfect for this shoot.

Was your brother
in the Stride Club, too?

[RIKU]
Heh. Sure was.

315
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,958
[DIANE] He wasn't just
"in the Stride Club."

316
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,125
He was the best
high school runner.

00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,125
Did you ever get to
practice together?

319
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,750
Yeah, but I kinda lost

Really? Why's that?

When I got to middle school

322
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,291
all the other sports
seemed so cool!

323
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,750
I wanted to try basketball,
volleyball, soccer.

You name it!

[NANA] And you seem
good at all of them!

Y'know, now that you're
a member of Honan Stride,

it would be neat if you could
run alongside him someday.

Careful, boys.

Didn't anybody ever bother
to teach you the saying,

"danger lurks around
every corner"?

And I can think of another
one that's quite fitting:

"Japan is so small.

win after all!

After the last few days,

that's not really
much of a shock.

[NANA]
No, but look at this.

450
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,875
When the Relations do work,

the best on the team.

he's sending or receiving,

he always does the same thing.

00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,458
He executes his role
in the Relation

456
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,625
based on his partner's
maximum speed.

It's pretty impressive.

I thought he was
being reckless,

but I guess I should
start trusting his pace.

it probably sounds a
little scary to you,

trusting each other!

there's no time to hesitate.

That was awesome!

474
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,541
[panting]

475
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,208
Great job dude!
Looked like fun!

476
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:53,125
Kinda makes me wanna
give it a try.

477
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,333
[exhales]

478
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,250
Let's do it.

479
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,666
[ANNOUNCER 2A]
On your mark...

480
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,666
Get set...

481
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,666
[buzzing]

482
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,333
[NANA]
Takeru. Set!

483
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,583
[RIKU panting]

484
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,708
[NANA]
Three... two... one...

485
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:21,791
Go!

486
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,375
[NANA] He executes his
role in the Relation

487
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,666
based on his partner's
maximum speed.

488
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,750
It's pretty impressive.

489
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,791
[NANA] We've gotta start
trusting each other!

490
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,083
'Cause that's what
Stride's all about!

491
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,875
You're doing it! Full speed!

492
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,416
[TAKERU]
Yagami.

493
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,375
I have faith in you.

494
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,250
[clap]

495
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,291
[NANA]
They did it!

496
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,375
[HEATH, HOZUMI, AYUMU]
Yeah!

497
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,166
[NANA]
That was great!

498
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,958
All Takeru wanted was for
Riku to Relay at full speed!

499
00:20:59,041 --> 00:20:59,916
Good job.

500
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,666
And it was about time, huh?

501
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,708
[HOZUMI]
We better up our game, too.

502
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,166
...It reminded me of the
Bo-Gin rush strategy in Shogi!

503
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,875
[TAKERU]
This is just the beginning.

504
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,541
We can go even faster.

505
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,250
Obviously.

506
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,791
We're gonna blast our
records in tomorrow's match!

507
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,375
You watch!

508
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,541
[DAN] Well, your opponent
for the match has changed.

509
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,375
[ALL]
Huh?

510
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,958
You've gotta be kidding me!

511
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:31,166
The event committee rarely makes
last minute changes like this.

512
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,750
But our first opponent
of the year is now...

513
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,458
Saisei Academy High School.

514
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,083
[ALL gasping]

515
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,583
No way!

516
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,750
They're one of the strongest
teams out there!

517
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,791
Saisei High School?
From the other day.

518
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,500
We're gonna win this race.

519
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,958
There's no backing
down, not now.

520
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,333
Oh, I get it.

521
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,666
You already knew who
those guys were.

522
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,666
[HOZUMI]
C'mon!

523
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,083
As much as I hate
wearing a dress,

524
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,958
we don't wanna lose
our sponsor, do we?

525
00:21:59,041 --> 00:21:59,958
No way!

526
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,291
We've got this, guys.

527
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,458
[RIKU]
U-Uh...

528
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,208
Get a good wind in your heart.

529
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,291
Are you all with me?

530
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,166
[ALL]
Yeah!

531
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,666
[RIKU]
Finally, it's here.

532
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,875
Our very first match.

533
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:26,333
Kichijoji Spring
Stride Festival!

534
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,875
[RIKU] I can't believe
I lost to Takeru again!

535
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,625
[HOZUMI] Quite whining,
Riku, you'll never beat him.

536
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:12,833
[RIKU]
Say what?!

537
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,291
[HOZUMI] Takeru and
Heath are part of K2G,

538
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,208
the Kool Kids Group!

539
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,625
[RIKU]
What's that make us?

540
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:19,083
[HOZUMI] Next on "Prinstride,"
"Revenge of the M2G!"

541
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,458
[RIKU]
Uh. What's that stand for?

542
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,000
The "Mere Mortals Group"?!
