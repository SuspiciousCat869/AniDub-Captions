Dang, he's fast.

7
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,291
That starting dash
of his is no joke, man.

8
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,791
If only he could keep his speed
up throughout the whole race.

You know?

10
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,250
[DAN] Good work,
Kohinata and Yagami.

11
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,208
You're done for the day.

12
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,375
[HOZUMI]
Yes, sir!

13
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:13,125
[RIKU gasping]
I can keep going!

14
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,333
Don't push yourself.

15
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,208
The last thing we need
is you getting hurt.

[panting]

17
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:20,208
I won't! I'm okay!

18
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,041
Go home and get some rest.

19
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:26,000
[NANA] I've never seen Riku
train so hard before.

20
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:29,416
He must be determined
to outrun his brother.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,125
[DAN]
Nice, Kuga. You're done.

22
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,583
Keep in mind, Yagami.

23
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,000
The whole point of
interval training

24
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,583
is to boost your
cardiopulmonary function.

25
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,416
It's not to race.

26
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,625
Yes, sir.

27
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:18,791
[AYUMU] You gotta learn
to keep an even pace

28
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,750
if we wanna be the
Stride champions.

29
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,166
Yeah.

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,333
Thanks, buddy.

31
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,041
But, I probably shouldn't
give any advice.

32
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,375
Considering my last race.

33
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,250
Can you say, crash and burn?

They're so fast!

37
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,750
I'm getting tired
just watching them.

38
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,916
[AYUMU] Do you mind if I
take a look at the stats?

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,250
Let's see...

40
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,125
I finished in 61 seconds,
Hozumi and Riku did 52,

41
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,708
Kyosuke 47,
and these two tied at...

42
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,958
...45 seconds?!

43
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,958
[HOZUMI] They must be
superhuman or something.

Yeah, what's up?

I know you're done for the day
but will ya do a set with me?

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,333
I wanna run against someone,
like a real race.

Sure, let's do it.

It's not working.

I'm trying so hard, but it
doesn't matter how much I run.

54
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,541
I'm not getting any faster.

55
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,291
It's just like what
happened last time.

[RIKU gasps]
What do you want?

57
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,583
Your breathing is disrupted.

58
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,875
Catch your breath
before collapsing.

59
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,333
[TAKERU]
Your running is terrible.

60
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,541
[RIKU]
Uh.

61
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,833
[HOZUMI] Oh no, are they
gonna fight again?!

62
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,458
[AYUMU] I thought
the nightmare was over!

63
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,125
[HEATH] Takeru, there's
no need to be so harsh.

64
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,916
[RIKU]
It's okay.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,500
He's right.

66
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,625
[HOZUMI] Hold up!
What just happened?!

67
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,583
There should be pigs flying
overhead any second now.

68
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,458
I dunno why but I always start
to slow down toward the end.

69
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:59,125
I gotta do something,
but... what?

70
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,333
Well, I've been looking over
the team's numbers.

71
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,000
And I don't think it
has anything to do

72
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,416
with your stamina.

73
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,958
Your times aren't bad.

74
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,000
I mean, your three-thousand
meter is slower than Takeru's

75
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,000
but not by much.

76
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,875
Your 400 meter's not great,

77
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,791
but that's probably
just 'cause you still have

78
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,458
some technique issues
you need to work on.

79
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:16,791
I have a feeling

80
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,333
there's something holding
you back emotionally.

you mind helping Yagami

up his training regimen?

a bottomless pit.

how much I've run today?!

pushing himself too hard.

For real, if he keeps this up

"Why're you so slow?"

It's pointless.

I've seen videos of
him running before,

but watching him live
at the time trial

264
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,666
was terrifying, man.

265

different level.

He's always been fast.

271
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,000
I used to run in the same club
as him back in the day.

272
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:47,416
I remember he used to practice
harder than anybody.

273
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,583
I always admired his
dedication to Stride.

274
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,583
I thought if I worked hard
enough I could be just like him.

275
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,416
So I trained with him every day
hoping that I'd get faster.

276
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,041
But...

277
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,791
[RIKU]
There was this one day.

278
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,875
Practice was cancelled 'cause
of a storm, but nobody told him.

279
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,083
[RIKU] When Tomoe didn't
come home after school

280
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,208
I decided to go look for him.

281
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:20,291
The first place I checked
was where we trained.

[RIKU gasps]

283
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,541
I guess practice was cancelled
but nobody bothered to tell me.

284
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,208
[RIKU]
That's when it struck me.

285
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,250
I ran Stride 'cause
I thought it was fun,

286
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,208
but it was Tomoe's life.

287
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:46,208
And he had a talent
for it that I lacked.

288
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:50,666
Work as hard as I might,
I'd never be as fast as him.

289
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,666
Once I came to that realization,

290
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,041
running wasn't fun
for me anymore.

291
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,875
So I decided to quit Stride.

292
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:05,083
I see, but now you're
back with a vengeance.

293
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:08,041
I keep telling myself I'm
not who I was back then.

294
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,375
That I can run Stride
just for fun.

295
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,916
But then, Tomoe's team
showed up in Hokkaido.

296
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,833
And I watched him run again.

297
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,291
I realized that,
after all this time,

298
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,500
I'm still chasing his back.

299
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,666
I'm stuck.

300
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,583
I loved running Stride but now
that he's back I dunno anymore.

301
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,416
Look, If you love Stride,
don't let him ruin it for you.

Hey, I know!

303
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,833
Instead of worryin' about him
start running for yourself

304
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,875
and for your teammates!

cheered me up a little.

my team's game again.

gotta look that stuff up!

00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,458
I'll see ya later!

317
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,125
[RIKU laughs]

318
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,708
[AYUMU panting]
Yay, I did it!

319
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,000
[NANA]
Way to go, Ayumu!

320
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,208
Your times keep getting
faster and faster!

321
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,166
[HEATH]
Nice work, guys!

322
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,041
Aw, crap.

323
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,500
Looks like it's about to pour.

324
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,666
That's it for today!

325
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,375
--[NANA] Yes, sir!
--[AYUMU] Hallelujah!

326
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,083
Hey man, You comin' in with us?

327
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:55,458
[TAKERU] No, I'm gonna go
practice on my own for a bit.

328
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,208
[AYUMU, HOZUMI, NANA]
Heh!

329
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,375
Okay. But don't overdo it!

330
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,625
[AYUMU] Let's hope he can
find Riku relatively fast.

331
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,458
Cause it's supposed
to get bad later.

332
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,375
[KYOSUKE]
A storm can be a good thing.

333
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,083
It's a sign of change.

334
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:12,625
[thunder rumbles]

335
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,916
[RIKU panting]

336
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,458
[RIKU]
Go away!

337
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,958
Can't you see I'm tryin'
to do my own thing here?

338
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,666
[TAKERU]
Well then don't mind me.

339
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,250
It's kinda hard to ignore you
when you run up behind me!

340
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,000
That was creepy,
even for you, bro!

341
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,000
[TAKERU]
Yeah, whatever.

342
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,791
You're just mad
that I passed you.

343
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,416
[RIKU panting]

344
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,916
Aw, it's raining!

345
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
[BOY 10A]
Let's go!

346
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,125
[BOY 10C]
Don't forget the ball!

347
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,791
[RIKU panting]

348
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:58,875
[TOMOE]
I guess.

349
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,416
It was cancelled
but nobody told me.

350
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,333
[RIKU] You've taken all
the fun out if it, Tomoe!

351
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,875
Look, I don't wanna
do Stride anymore!

352
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,375
I never wanted to.

353
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,666
You forced me.

354
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,666
[RIKU panting]

355
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,833
Just go ahead.

356
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,458
You don't have to wait for me.

357
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,958
[TOMOE]
I understand.

358
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,833
I'm sorry I pushed it on you.

359
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,708
[TAKERU]
Yagami.

360
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,500
I'd never leave you behind.

361
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:31,791
[gasps]

362
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,791
Let's go.

363
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,291
Okay. If that's what you want.

364
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,208
[RIKU]
Sure, running Stride is tough.

365
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,500
But...

366
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,000
[NANA]
Hey!

367
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:25,875
[HOZUMI laughs]

368
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,333
[AYUMU]
You're almost there!

369
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,250
--[HEATH] All right!
--[HOZUMI] You can do it!

370
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,083
[NANA]
Keep it up, you guys!

371
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:34,041
[TAKERU]
Race ya to the finish line!

372
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,458
[RIKU]
I love it!

373
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,291
[BOTH panting]

374
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,166
[NANA]
C'mon, Riku! You've got this!

375
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,583
[HOZUMI]
Let's go, Yagami, let's go!

376
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,625
[HEATH] You're so close, man!
Just a little farther!

377
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,083
Hooray! Go!

378
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,291
Leave Takeru in the dust!

379
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,291
Show him who's boss!

380
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,750
Final dash, bro!

381
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,208
[RIKU panting]

382
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,041
[RIKU]
I'm running for my teammates!

383
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,166
[RIKU]
And I'm running...

384
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,333
...for myself!

385
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,083
He passed him!

386
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,416
[RIKU gasping, laughing]

387
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,208
[TAKERU panting]

388
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,625
[TAKERU]
C'mon, Yagami.

389
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,000
What'd I tell you?

390
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,416
You have to catch your breath
before you collapse.

391
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,166
You got it?

392
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,041
Yeah.

393
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,333
[panting] Way to go.

394
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,541
That last dash was good.

395
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:39,250
But next time, I'm gonna
run even faster.

396
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:44,708
[RIKU] Heh. That's cool,
do your worst.

397
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:49,583
Now that I've passed you
I won't lose again.

398
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,166
I'm gonna go cool off.

399
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,791
[RIKU]
Hey! Wait up!

400
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,000
Where do you think
you're goin'?!

401
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,166
Come back here, Takeru!

402
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,541
Asuma, how many of those
things have you eaten today?

403
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:41,833
[ASUMA]
Mm?

404
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:44,875
[sighs] Every Yakisoba bun
contains an average

405
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:47,166
of 300 kcals. I know
they're delicious

406
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,541
but you should really limit
yourself to two per day.

407
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,666
If you start gaining weight
it could slow you down

408
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,250
and then we'll never beat
Honan, much less Kakyoin.

409
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,333
You've got to learn to control
yourself when it comes to food.

410
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,416
[SHIZUMA]
Hm?

411
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:10,541
[AYUMU] Whoa! Media coverage
at the semi-finals is insane!

412
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,250
Whaddya say we take
over the airwaves?!

413
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:15,291
Yo, yo, yo! Honan Academy Shogi
Club is in the hizzouse!

414
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,250
Come and join the gang!
Shogi life, what?!

415
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,666
[HOZUMI]
We're here for Stride, dummy!

416
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,583
Next on "Prinstride,"
"Runners on the Shogi Board!"

417
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,000
Rook-King fork!
