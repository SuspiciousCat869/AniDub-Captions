♪

00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.966
Everybody's
rushing all around,

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:12.100
afraid they won't get into the
Junior Arc League Championship,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.433
but I don't have to worry.

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:16.700
My cards tell me
that starting tomorrow

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.233
I will win six duels
in a row

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:20.933
and get into the championship
for sure.

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:21.933
And‐‐

00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.666
Oh, my!

00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.400

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.233
The cards say I'm going
to meet my duelmate.

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:38.566
Oh, this is just
too much for me!

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:43.466
(Nico Smiley)
The point is that I can honestly
say without any hesitation

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.666
that my plan to make you a pro
is on track.

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:49.166
Right on track, huh?

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.866
So, in your next match,

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.100
you must come up
with something

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.600
to surprise, shock,
and astound me!

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.900
Astound him?

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.033
Hmm.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.866
(sighs)

00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.566
Oh, gimme a break!

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.133
How am I supposed to do that?

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.233
I don't think I'll ever
be able to do it!

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.333
This is, like,
beyond frustrating.

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:14.233
I'll never learn how to max out
my Pendulum power.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.933
Huh?

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.600
Zuzu's card.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.333

Where are my cards?!

Cards?
Cards?

00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:54.133
Oh, where'd I put

my one and only
true duelmate.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.500
I wonder what he's going
to be like?

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.233
A super‐slick teen‐idol type?

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:20.633
A hunky muscle man?

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:24.333

00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:25.633
(shrieking)

00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:27.966
I'm ready for you,
duelmate.

00:03:27.966 --> 00:03:29.500
Come and get me!

00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:33.533
(panting)

00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:34.933
That's weird.

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:37.066
This is the address Nico gave me
for the duel.

00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:38.200
Where's the school?

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:46.833
(sighs)
Well, I guess this is the place.

00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:49.966
Whoa, at least it can't get
any scarier.

00:03:49.966 --> 00:03:51.300
Welcome, my boy.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.300
(screaming)

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.600
Nico?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.466
I've been waiting
for you.

00:03:57.466 --> 00:03:59.600
Enter.
(chuckles)

00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:06.133
They should've paid
their light bill.

00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:08.366
Careful.
The steps can be...

00:04:08.366 --> 00:04:09.566
treacherous.

00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:11.633
Don't worry,
I'll be careful.

00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:12.766
Whoa!
Aah!

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:17.100
(grunting)

00:04:18.366 --> 00:04:20.033
(groaning)

00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:22.166
So much for "careful."

00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:24.000
Nahh!

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.200
Ahh!

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.533
(laughs)
Oh, boy.

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:29.000
Bad first
impression.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.300
You almost... broke my precious
and delicate crystal ball!

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.633
Ooh!

00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:36.433
This is totally
impossible!

00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:40.600
There's no way this dork of
a duelist could be my duelmate!

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.000
Huh?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.666
But he must be.

00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:48.333
I've always been able to predict
everything perfectly‐‐

00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:50.700
the right way to go...

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.700
Ah.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.300
...answers on tests...

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.766
Ah.

00:04:57.766 --> 00:05:00.233
...even the weather.

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:04.200
My fortune‐telling skills have
never failed before.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.833
Maybe they didn't
this time either.

00:05:06.833 --> 00:05:08.033
(Yuya)
Excuse me.

00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:10.366
Can't you see
I'm thinking?!

00:05:10.366 --> 00:05:12.700
Sorry, but shouldn't
we duel now?

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.866
Oh, we'll duel!

00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:17.000
That's the best way
for me to tell

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.466
whether my prediction about you
is true or not.

00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:23.233
And now,
without further ado,

00:05:23.233 --> 00:05:27.633
the duel between the dueltainer
extraordinaire Yuya Sakaki

00:05:27.633 --> 00:05:31.700
and flawless Fortuneteller
and prodigious predictress
Aura Sentia

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.300
is about to begin!

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.566
It gives me great pride
to present to you

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:41.366
Fortune Prep's mystical
matriarch Madame Divina!

00:05:41.366 --> 00:05:44.266
Our destiny exists for us
to follow or not,

00:05:44.266 --> 00:05:46.566
and though we mortals
cannot visualize it,

00:05:46.566 --> 00:05:49.066
our lives must travel down
the path of time.

00:05:49.066 --> 00:05:52.600
The telling of fortunes
is like a flame that guides us.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.833
Whether we choose
to follow it or not

00:05:54.833 --> 00:05:57.833
always remains up to us.

00:05:57.833 --> 00:06:02.266
I activate the Action Field
Spell Fortuneterror!

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.233

Augmented reality combat
system energized.

<i>Generating Action Field.</i>

00:06:18.966 --> 00:06:21.200
Something is carved
into the pillars!

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.266
The Fool, a Chariot,
a Magician, and Emperor.

00:06:24.266 --> 00:06:26.533
They're all symbols
of Tarot cards!

00:06:26.533 --> 00:06:28.266
This is so magical!

00:06:28.266 --> 00:06:30.333
We're gonna duel here?

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:32.066
That's right.

00:06:32.066 --> 00:06:35.000
My fortune‐telling abilities
are never wrong.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.166
With it, I'll learn if
you're truly destined

00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:38.900
to be my one
and only duelmate.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.200
Your "destined duelmate"?
What're you talking‐‐

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.666
You'll see!
Uhh...

00:06:42.666 --> 00:06:45.800
This is a battle
that will reveal our future!

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.800
And I know it's a fantastic
future full of fun

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.900
because winning
is totally in the cards!

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.200
Now, let the fight for
the future begin!

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.133
(all)
This is gonna be great!

00:06:57.133 --> 00:06:58.433
Duel!
Duel!

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.266
(computer voice)
<i>Action Cards dispersed.</i>

00:07:04.266 --> 00:07:08.266
First, let's see how your
fortune‐telling skills are.

00:07:08.266 --> 00:07:11.033
There's a dragon on one side
and a fiend on the other.

00:07:11.033 --> 00:07:12.466
I'm going to flip the coin

00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:14.633
and if you guess
which side lands face‐up,

00:07:14.633 --> 00:07:16.700
you get to choose
who goes first.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.733
Huh.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.300
Well, which is it?

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.266
I... think... it's...

00:07:25.266 --> 00:07:27.466
It's the Dragon!

00:07:27.466 --> 00:07:29.400
Nope, sorry,
it's the fiend.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.400
Oh.
I knew it!

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.033
You don't have the slightest
ability to predict anything.

00:07:34.033 --> 00:07:37.233
Well, I would've gotten it
if you had given me
one more guess.

00:07:37.233 --> 00:07:40.700
Sorry, but I'll be making
the first move in this duel.

00:07:42.233 --> 00:07:43.633
(sighs, then giggles)

00:07:43.633 --> 00:07:45.533
And with it, I'm placing
one monster facedown

00:07:45.533 --> 00:07:47.700
in defense mode.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.800
Huh?
Wonder what it is.

00:07:51.966 --> 00:07:53.966
Not knowing what
the monster is

00:07:53.966 --> 00:07:55.900
makes things
even more mysterious.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.766
It's your turn, Yuya.
I'm finished for now.

00:07:58.766 --> 00:08:00.866
Ugh!
But why?

00:08:00.866 --> 00:08:04.166
The right time will come for me
to turn this card over

00:08:04.166 --> 00:08:07.266
and when it does, our true
destinies will be revealed.

00:08:07.266 --> 00:08:08.733
Hey, what's your deal?

00:08:08.733 --> 00:08:10.766
Why do you keep talking
about destiny?

00:08:10.766 --> 00:08:12.033
You'll see.

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.000
Even though you can't
predict the future,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.966
surely you can see
it's your turn, Yuya.

00:08:16.966 --> 00:08:18.900
Hey, that's harsh!

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:21.433
But suit yourself!

00:08:21.433 --> 00:08:24.133
Something's bothering you.
I can tell.

00:08:24.133 --> 00:08:27.866
Bothering me?
What would make you think that?

00:08:27.866 --> 00:08:30.400
When I flipped the coin,
you chose the dragon.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.066
That indicates a deep,
desperate desire

00:08:33.066 --> 00:08:34.933
to overcome
some kind of failure

00:08:34.933 --> 00:08:37.566
by using power and force.

00:08:37.566 --> 00:08:39.433
Obviously,
you feel lost

00:08:39.433 --> 00:08:42.900
and you don't have a clue
about what to do next.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.200
(thinking)
<i>She's right.</i>

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.233
I don't know how to max out
my Pendulum power,

00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:48.166
but I can't think
about that now.

00:08:48.166 --> 00:08:50.700
I have to focus
on winning this duel.

00:08:52.066 --> 00:08:53.733
I draw!

00:08:55.466 --> 00:08:57.033
(thinking)
<i>It's Odd‐Eyes.</i>

00:08:57.033 --> 00:09:00.933
The Pendulum Scale
I can set is 1 to 4.

00:09:00.933 --> 00:09:03.033
But the problem is I only
have monsters

00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:06.966
that are Level 5 and above,
so I can't summon them.

00:09:06.966 --> 00:09:10.300
I can't do anything
with this hand!

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.666
I think I'll...
end my turn.

00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:16.133
I had a funny feeling
you would.

00:09:16.133 --> 00:09:18.666
What?
He didn't summon a monster

00:09:18.666 --> 00:09:20.966
or even place a card
facedown.

00:09:20.966 --> 00:09:23.266
I never saw Yuya
play this way!

00:09:23.266 --> 00:09:25.033
There's gotta be
a reason.

00:09:25.033 --> 00:09:26.600
I need something!

00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:30.300
An Action Card!

00:09:34.233 --> 00:09:37.266
My card should be here,
but where did it go?

00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:40.666
(phone humming)
Hmm?

00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:42.033
Hello?

00:09:42.033 --> 00:09:44.600
Zuzu!
Where are you right now?

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.266
Just taking a little walk.

00:09:46.266 --> 00:09:48.533
My duel starts in
a few minutes and if I win,

00:09:48.533 --> 00:09:50.766
I'll get into the Junior Arc
League Championship,

00:09:50.766 --> 00:09:52.633
so you better
get down here right now!

00:09:52.633 --> 00:09:54.633
I'll do my best, but‐‐

00:09:54.633 --> 00:09:56.700
No buts,
you just be there!

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.933
Yes, sir.

00:09:57.933 --> 00:10:01.433
(Aura)
It's my turn! I draw!

00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:04.500
I Flip Summon Prediction
Princess Coinorma!

00:10:05.933 --> 00:10:07.866
What's flip summoning?

00:10:07.866 --> 00:10:10.100
Flip Summoning is when
you summon a monster

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.766
by flipping it
from facedown to face‐up.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.000
When I flip over my monster,
its special ability activates.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.866
Coinorma's special ability

00:10:26.866 --> 00:10:30.700
lets me place another monster
facedown on my field.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.400
Just like this!

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.166
I'm sensing a pattern here.

00:10:38.166 --> 00:10:40.900
It's nice to see you're
following along, Yuya.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.133
And now Coinorma will
predict your future.
Ugh.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.500
This fortune predicts that
you will soon face a choice

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.633
that will affect your destiny.

00:10:54.633 --> 00:10:57.600
Yuya doesn't even have
any cards on his field yet.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.666
If he doesn't do something,
he'll take a direct attack!

00:11:00.666 --> 00:11:03.200
I wish Yuya had
an Action Card.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.366
Yuya, Coinorma attacks you
directly!

00:11:09.266 --> 00:11:11.566
I gotta turn this around!

00:11:11.566 --> 00:11:13.066
Two action cards!

00:11:13.066 --> 00:11:15.033
You can only have one
Action Card

00:11:15.033 --> 00:11:16.866
in your hand
at a time, Yuya.

00:11:16.866 --> 00:11:19.566
The card you choose will
decide your destiny.

00:11:19.566 --> 00:11:21.333
What's it gonna be?

00:11:25.166 --> 00:11:27.266
I gotta turn this around!

00:11:27.266 --> 00:11:28.766
Two action cards!

00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:30.800
You can only have one
Action Card

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.700
in your hand
at a time, Yuya.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.266
The card you choose will
decide your destiny.

00:11:35.266 --> 00:11:37.433
Okay.
Then I choose...

00:11:37.433 --> 00:11:39.100
this one!

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.833
Ugh.
Lousy Luck!

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:42.533
It's a pretty accurate name

00:11:42.533 --> 00:11:44.866
because it deals you
800 points of damage.

00:11:44.866 --> 00:11:47.066
Huh?

00:11:47.066 --> 00:11:48.666
(screaming)

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:49.866
(grunts)

00:11:51.933 --> 00:11:54.200
The odds of drawing Lousy Luck
on this field

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.833
are a million to one.

00:11:55.833 --> 00:11:58.333
You clearly have the kind of
luck that I call bad.

00:11:59.933 --> 00:12:01.833
(Yuya groaning)

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.566
Aw.

00:12:04.566 --> 00:12:06.566
Her prediction came true.

00:12:06.566 --> 00:12:08.800
Almost finished
but not quite.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.433
I tribute Coinorma to summon
one card from my hand

00:12:12.433 --> 00:12:15.866
and put it facedown
in defense mode!

00:12:15.866 --> 00:12:17.200
(grunting)

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.866
Another face‐down card
in defense mode?

00:12:19.866 --> 00:12:21.133
That's right.

00:12:21.133 --> 00:12:23.033
Another card that
represents a future

00:12:23.033 --> 00:12:25.400
you can't seem
to predict.
Ugh.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.733
I foresee that this duel will
be over before you know it!

00:12:28.733 --> 00:12:30.666
We'll see about that.

00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:32.333
It's showtime!

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.666
Yes!
I summon Performapal Bowhopper!

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.666
(thinking) Both her
monsters are facedown.

00:12:41.666 --> 00:12:43.266
Which one should
I attack?

00:12:43.266 --> 00:12:45.766
Since she got rid
of another monster to bring
the left one out,

00:12:45.766 --> 00:12:47.633
it's probably
really strong.

00:12:47.633 --> 00:12:49.533
Too strong
for my Bowhopper.

00:12:49.533 --> 00:12:51.133
Be careful, Yuya.

00:12:51.133 --> 00:12:53.700
If anybody as unlucky as you
tries to duel,

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.566
I predict total disaster.

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:57.566
I don't care
what you predict!

00:12:57.566 --> 00:12:58.833
Let's go!

00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:00.866
Performapal Bowhopper,

00:13:00.866 --> 00:13:02.800
attack the monster
on the right!

00:13:05.033 --> 00:13:08.633
I'm activating my trap,
Black Cat‐Tastrophe!

00:13:08.633 --> 00:13:10.100
(meowing)

00:13:13.233 --> 00:13:15.033
Black cats
crossing his path!

00:13:15.033 --> 00:13:16.200
That's bad!

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.666
Thirteen black cats!

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.066
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

00:13:22.066 --> 00:13:24.766
Your luck's truly going
from bad to worse, Yuya,

00:13:24.766 --> 00:13:27.600
because Black Cat‐Tastrophe
ends the battle!

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.200
Hope that doesn't throw
you off your game too much.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.566
Not a chance!
Whoa!

00:13:32.566 --> 00:13:34.400
(thud)

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.966
(groaning)

00:13:35.966 --> 00:13:38.300
What, did you put a curse
on me or something?

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.900
I already told you,
you're an unlucky person.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.033
I don't believe in
your silly superstitions.

00:13:44.033 --> 00:13:45.633
You don't have
to believe it,

00:13:45.633 --> 00:13:47.966
but if the past is any
indication of the future,

00:13:47.966 --> 00:13:50.500
I wouldn't walk under any
ladders if I were you.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.766
Agh, I think I'll end
my turn now.

00:13:58.133 --> 00:13:59.800
It's clear to me.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.400
There's no way
you're my duelmate.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.900
Your luck's too rotten.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.300
So I'm gonna erase you from
this duel and from my life!

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.166
That sounds
kind of extreme.

00:14:08.166 --> 00:14:10.766
Tough luck.
I draw!
(grunts)

00:14:10.766 --> 00:14:13.800
I Flip Summon Prediction
Princess Arrowsylph!

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.333
When Arrowsylph's
flipped over,

00:14:25.333 --> 00:14:28.200
I can take one
Ritual Spell card
from my deck or graveyard

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.500
and add it
directly to my hand!

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:31.966
That's not good.

00:14:31.966 --> 00:14:34.833
(Aura)
I add Prediction Ritual!

00:14:36.433 --> 00:14:38.400
Next, I'm Flip Summoning

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.266
the sparkling Prediction
Princess Crystaldine!

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.266
When Crystaldine is flipped,

00:14:48.266 --> 00:14:52.100
I can add a Ritual Spell Card
to my hand.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.700
Here's my choice,
Prediction Princess Tarotrei!

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.066
A Ritual Spell and a Ritual
Monster in her hand

00:14:59.066 --> 00:15:01.100
can only mean
one thing.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.300
What one thing?

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.333
She's got to be planning
a Ritual Summon.

00:15:04.333 --> 00:15:06.900
She's gonna summon a high
Level Ritual Monster

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.600
using a Ritual Spell!

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.466
Now Crystaldine will help me
tell your fortune, Yuya.

00:15:13.466 --> 00:15:15.933
(moaning)

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.700
I see a cloud,
a cloud of darkness

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.100
that you cannot escape
from, Yuya.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.033
And that's exactly
what's gonna happen

00:15:25.033 --> 00:15:27.966
when I play my spell
Prediction Ritual!

00:15:36.133 --> 00:15:37.500
(crashing)

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.500
I offer my Prediction
Princess Arrowsylph

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.400
and Prediction Princess
Crystaldine

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.366
to the great beyond to unlock
the secrets of the mystic!

00:15:47.366 --> 00:15:51.000
Oh, ancient sorceress, who
peers through the veil of life,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.400
may the supernatural
secret spell

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.466
awaken you without strife!

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.700
I Ritual Summon!

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.166
Prediction Princess Tarotrei!

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.433
I don't like
the looks of this!

00:16:24.966 --> 00:16:27.300
I don't like
the looks of this!

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.533
Prediction Princess Tarotrei,
take out that Bowhopper!

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.933
(screams)

00:16:41.566 --> 00:16:43.766
Oh, no!
Yuya's in trouble!

00:16:43.766 --> 00:16:46.700
I place one monster
facedown in defense mode

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.300
and end my turn.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.700
What's the use?

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.566
If all of her bad predictions
are gonna come true...

00:16:52.566 --> 00:16:54.733
No!
I can't give up on this duel!

00:16:54.733 --> 00:16:58.100
I'll win!
I have to win!

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.633
Making the Junior Arc League
Championship will put me

00:17:00.633 --> 00:17:02.666
on the path
to becoming a pro!

00:17:02.666 --> 00:17:04.333
Let's do this!

00:17:04.333 --> 00:17:05.433
I draw!

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.000
All right.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.200
Here's my prediction!
Huh?

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.300
You're gonna lose
and I'm gonna win.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.766
Go, Yuya!
Go, Yuya!
Go, Yuya!

00:17:14.766 --> 00:17:16.133
Here comes the Pendulum!

00:17:16.133 --> 00:17:19.633
I set the Pendulum Scale
with Scale 1 Stargazer Magician

00:17:19.633 --> 00:17:21.300
and Scale 8 Timegazer Magician!

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.633
I'm taking control of this duel
starting now!

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.233
♪

00:17:37.366 --> 00:17:40.166
Now I can summon monsters
from Level 2 through 7

00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:41.733
all at the same time!

00:17:41.733 --> 00:17:45.833
Swing far, Pendulum!
Carve the arc of victory!

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.966
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:17:55.433 --> 00:17:57.966
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:17:57.966 --> 00:17:59.166
(roaring)

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.133
Shake things up,
Performapal Elephammer!

00:18:07.133 --> 00:18:11.000
Sting your way to victory,
Performapal Kaleidoscorp!

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.700
Lend a helping hand,
Performapal Partnaga!

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.466
Flap to it,
Performapal Springoose!

00:18:19.566 --> 00:18:21.133
Five monsters at once!

00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:23.100
I got
the goosepickles!

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.266
It's five for victory!

00:18:25.266 --> 00:18:26.766
We'll see.

00:18:26.766 --> 00:18:28.066
What's that mean?

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:29.966
You still don't
get it.

00:18:29.966 --> 00:18:31.466
I know you'll lose

00:18:31.466 --> 00:18:33.600
just by reading
the cards you're playing.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.466
You mean like reading
tarot cards?

00:18:36.466 --> 00:18:39.133
Exactly.
Your cards are a mess!

00:18:39.133 --> 00:18:40.666
Take the dragon card.

00:18:40.666 --> 00:18:42.766
The dragon is known
as a beast to be feared,

00:18:42.766 --> 00:18:45.066
but yours is simply
full of hot air!

00:18:45.066 --> 00:18:48.633
Your elephant, full of brawn
but afraid of a teeny mouse.

00:18:48.633 --> 00:18:50.333
The goose symbolizes
a duelist

00:18:50.333 --> 00:18:52.633
who wants to fly away
from their fears.

00:18:52.633 --> 00:18:56.200
The scorpion, full of venom,
but yours is full of fear.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.866
Lastly, the snake‐‐

00:18:57.866 --> 00:19:00.066
it exposes your desire
to slither away

00:19:00.066 --> 00:19:01.733
when things
don't go your way.

00:19:01.733 --> 00:19:02.966
It's clear.

00:19:02.966 --> 00:19:04.400
Based on where
you placed your cards,

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.100
you've already sealed
your fate.
Hmm.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.800
Darkness looms
before you.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.066
And failure will
swallow you up.

00:19:13.066 --> 00:19:16.133
Darkness and failure?

00:19:16.133 --> 00:19:17.400
Don't believe her!

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.700
Y‐y‐you don't have
anything to be afraid of!

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.433
But so far, every prediction
she made came true!

00:19:22.433 --> 00:19:24.633
I know.
(whimpers)

00:19:24.633 --> 00:19:27.066
This is giving me the bad kind
of goosepickles!

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:30.000
Your predictions...

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.800
don't matter!

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.000
Mm‐hmm.
What you say doesn't either.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.700
When Partnaga's summoned,

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.433
I choose one monster
on my field

00:19:38.433 --> 00:19:41.466
and give its attack points
a helping hand!

00:19:41.466 --> 00:19:44.500
So now Odd‐Eyes gets
300 more attack points

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.166
for every Performapal
on my field!

00:19:47.166 --> 00:19:50.000
Now Yuya's got four
Performapals on his field!

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.600
So that's a 1,200‐point
power‐up.

00:19:58.366 --> 00:20:00.300
Odd‐Eyes,
attack Tarotrei!

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.066
I activate Tarotrei's
special ability!

00:20:05.066 --> 00:20:08.000
I flip my monster
face‐up to attack mode!

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.866
What?

00:20:10.866 --> 00:20:12.866
You can Flip Summon
on my turn?

00:20:14.066 --> 00:20:17.333
Prediction Princess Petalelf,
bloom!

00:20:19.366 --> 00:20:21.833
(laughing)

00:20:21.833 --> 00:20:23.700
When this card is
flipped over,

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.100
all the monsters on your field
switch to defense mode.

00:20:27.766 --> 00:20:29.700
What the...?
(grunting)

00:20:32.533 --> 00:20:34.633
And one more little detail‐‐

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:37.133
your monsters can't change
battle mode this turn.

00:20:37.133 --> 00:20:40.033
No!
Now, Tarotrei will
tell your fortune

00:20:40.033 --> 00:20:41.733
and your fate.

00:20:54.966 --> 00:20:57.800
Looks like my Tarotrei
has selected The Tower,

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.233
right‐side up.

00:20:59.233 --> 00:21:01.833
This card foretells
destruction, downfall,

00:21:01.833 --> 00:21:03.566
and worse, tragedy.

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:10.866
(screaming)

00:21:14.066 --> 00:21:15.933
Forfeit this duel,
Yuya.

00:21:15.933 --> 00:21:17.800
If you choose to continue,

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.866
this will be the last duel
of your life.

00:21:19.866 --> 00:21:21.300
(gasps)

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:10.433
