WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.966
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.000
(wind whipping)

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.333
Are you gonna
introduce me...

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.300
to your twin sister?

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.533
I have business
with this Xyz fugitive.

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.433
Um, heh,
what is that?

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:15.066
Don't play dumb!

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.233
I'm taking you down!

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:19.066
I Fusion Summon!

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.133
Lunalight Cat Dancer!

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.433
Shay's sister Lulu
is from the Xyz Dimension

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:28.433
So that means she would never
Fusion Summon like this girl.

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:31.033
That must mean
she's not Lulu.

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:33.500
Revenge is supposed
to be bittersweet.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.533
(laughing)

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.600
But I'm betting
it tastes delish!

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.100
Let's Duel!
Let's Duel!

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.433
Cat Dancer!
Take down that Clown!

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:44.700
(roars)

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.600
Aaaaah! Uhh!

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:53.933
(man)
You're coming with us.

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:54.800
Hmm?

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:58.833
(alarm blaring)
(Controller) A task force
from the Fusion dimension

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:00.700
just warped into
the Volcano Zone!

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.800
Send in my strike squadron.

00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:06.633
(men grunting and coughing)

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.233
This is the end of the line,
gentlemen.

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.366
Where's my Yuya?

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.300
Hmm?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.366
(both gasp)

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.400
Looks like
we found him...

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.633
and so did trouble!

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:25.033

I'm about to dish out some
serious punishment!

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:37.433
Get ready for the main course!

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:39.700
It's a mouthful!

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.633
<i>Bon appetit!</i>

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:44.933
(creatures squeaking
and grunting)

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:50.833
It looked like Reed was
on the ropes for a second,

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:52.633
but now he's really cooking!

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:54.900
Seriously folks, after
the stuffing they took,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.766
I don't think Halil
and Olga's monsters

00:02:56.766 --> 00:02:59.133
can stomach too much more!

00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:00.466
(giggling)

00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:03.400
What about
the other duels
that are going on?

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.666
Yeah, we've seen enough
of this here food fight!

00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:07.000
Look, pal!

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.133
Some of us happen
to adore Reed Pepper!

00:03:09.133 --> 00:03:10.466
Yeah, so zip it!

00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:11.600
(woman)
As far as we're concerned,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.433
they should only
show Reed's duels!

00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:14.600
That's absurd!

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.266
(woman)
You're absurd!

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:18.133
You tell 'em, Yoko!

00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:21.233
Every duelist deserves
their time in the spotlight.

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:25.000
As much as I enjoy watching Reed
carve up the competition....

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.300
(giggling)

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.033
I wanna see a whole lot more
of Dennis Macfield, too!

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:35.366
We don't give
a gesundheit about those
guys!

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:38.433
We want to know what's up
with Yuya und Zuzu!

00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:40.833
Let's go check out
their duels in person!
Yeah!

00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:45.033
Wait,
I'm coming with you!

00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:47.233
Oh, I should have
remembered to ask them

00:03:47.233 --> 00:03:49.366
to get Dennis's autograph.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.166
(all clamoring)

00:03:55.433 --> 00:03:56.800
(all gasp)

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.866
Hold on‐‐ you folks can't exit
the stadium right now.

00:03:59.866 --> 00:04:01.366
Return to your seats.

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.433
But why?
We can't leave?

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:05.133
Not even if I wanna
go back home?

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:06.233
What gives?

00:04:06.233 --> 00:04:07.800
You can't force people
to remain here!

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.433
(woman)
I'm afraid we can.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.200
Sorry, but I assure you,

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.500
this directive
is for your own safety.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.533
What do
you mean?

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:18.966
This is a first
for our company.

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:21.666
We have never used the Augmented
Reality Combat System

00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:24.766
in a non‐stadium setting,
and we have to take precautions.

00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:26.366
It's a matter
of safety.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.233
Surely
you understand.

00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:29.866
I see.

00:04:29.866 --> 00:04:31.633
If the Leo Corporation's
worried about

00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:34.333
putting bystanders in danger
during the competition,

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:36.700
then you can't be
too careful, of course.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.533
Ah, you're a wise man,
Mr. Boyle.

00:04:40.533 --> 00:04:42.566
And this must be
your student Tate,

00:04:42.566 --> 00:04:45.000
who made it to
the Youth Division finals, yes?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.466
Yeah...

00:04:46.466 --> 00:04:49.433
As you must be aware,
there will be a duel later today

00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:52.133
to determine who your opponent
is going to be,

00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:55.766
but I have no doubt
you will be facing Riley here.

00:04:55.766 --> 00:04:57.500
Hope you're looking forward
to the finals.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.366
I know I certainly am!

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:01.866
These duels
will be truly memorable,

00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:03.500
with the Youth finals
on the horizon

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.533
and the Junior Division
battle royal already underway.

00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:08.666
What a pity we can't
see what's going on

00:05:08.666 --> 00:05:10.366
in some of the zones
right now.

00:05:10.366 --> 00:05:13.566
But the video feeds
will be restored soon.

00:05:13.566 --> 00:05:15.900
Then you'll see that there's
no need to leave the arena

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.100
because everything
is proceeding

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.833
exactly as we planned.

00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:20.666
(chuckling)

00:05:22.033 --> 00:05:24.366
Now, why don't
I believe her?

00:05:27.133 --> 00:05:29.100
You're gonna be mincemeat!

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.600
Now, Hunting Hound!
Scorch him with Canine Canon!

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.300
Looks like our tough‐talking
friend is going to the dogs!

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.666
Darling!
Stay back!

00:05:37.666 --> 00:05:39.733
Uhh! But we have
to help Yuya!

00:05:39.733 --> 00:05:42.900
Gong's seen that look in
Yuya's eyes once before.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.733
Might be best
to leave him be right now.

00:05:45.733 --> 00:05:46.666
Uh?

00:05:50.666 --> 00:05:54.000
Aaaagh!

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
He's completely
lost it.

00:05:58.133 --> 00:06:00.600
Does this feel like
bad news to you?

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.066
Let's finish him
before we find out!

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:07.366
No!

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:09.433
I'm going
to finishyou!

00:06:14.966 --> 00:06:17.933
Now that I've tapped into
the power of the Pendulum,

00:06:17.933 --> 00:06:20.900
your destruction
has been assured!

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.033
My monster is ready
to swing into action!

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.533
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:06:31.733 --> 00:06:35.066
Yuya's got a double dose
of dragons out!

00:06:35.066 --> 00:06:39.433
Now Xiangke Magician, I call
on you to work your sorcery!

00:06:39.433 --> 00:06:42.100
Use your Pendulum ability
to turn the tide of battle

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.933
in my favor!

00:06:47.466 --> 00:06:51.366
It changes Dark Rebellion Xyz
Dragon's Rank into a Level!

00:06:55.366 --> 00:06:57.033
Level Evolution!

00:06:58.166 --> 00:06:59.966
(roaring)

00:07:02.266 --> 00:07:03.333
Say what?

00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:05.833
Sir, this maneuver
is unprecedented!

00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:09.566
Xiangsheng Magician's Pendulum
ability activates!

00:07:09.566 --> 00:07:13.300
I'm taking aim and my game
to the next level!

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.500
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon
will now have the same Level

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.966
as Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:07:18.966 --> 00:07:20.833
The stage has been set!

00:07:24.133 --> 00:07:25.600
I can't believe it.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.966
How'd he do it?

00:07:26.966 --> 00:07:29.800
Now he's got two monsters
with the same Level!

00:07:31.366 --> 00:07:33.900
I overlay
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.333
and Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon

00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:37.466
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.666
I Xyz Summon...

00:07:49.666 --> 00:07:52.433
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon!

00:07:56.166 --> 00:07:58.666
Prepare to feel
my wrath!

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.500
(electricity sizzling)

00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:10.533
Prepare to feel
my wrath!

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:14.833
Argh, I've never felt
such intense power!

00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:16.433
(Aura)
Gong, gimme a boost!

00:08:16.433 --> 00:08:17.566
Hyuh!

00:08:17.566 --> 00:08:19.200
(grunting)
Yuya!

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.066
Whoa! Uhh!
Uhh!

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.200
Where am I?

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.800
What is this place?

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.266
Every time this card glows,
I end up someplace new.

00:08:35.266 --> 00:08:38.666
But this time it looks like
I also traveled through time...

00:08:38.666 --> 00:08:41.400
into a new ice age?

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.533
I wonder what humans
have evolved into.

00:08:44.533 --> 00:08:46.800
Huh? Look at those two
creatures!

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.733
Over here!

00:08:48.733 --> 00:08:50.400
Huh?
Huh?
Hey, look!

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.233
It's Yuya,
let's take him down!

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.533
Looks like manners
haven't evolved.

00:08:55.533 --> 00:08:58.500
That's no way to treat someone
you meet for the first time!

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.366
And the name's Yugo!

00:09:00.366 --> 00:09:02.433
And now I will unleash

00:09:02.433 --> 00:09:05.266
Odd Eyes Rebellion Dragon's
special ability.

00:09:05.266 --> 00:09:08.533
Your hapless Hounds will be
the first to feel its fury!

00:09:08.533 --> 00:09:11.000
After my Dragon
is done destroying them,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.400
it will turn to you,
who commanded them!

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.800
There will be no mercy
for any of you!

00:09:18.833 --> 00:09:21.500
Next, I will use
an Overlay Unit...

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.800
and that's very bad news
for you three,

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.200
because now my Odd‐Eyes
Rebellion Dragon

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.333
can attack all three of you
at once!

00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:30.666
He's gonna hit 'em
with a triple whammy?

00:09:30.666 --> 00:09:32.900
(roaring)

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.366
You came here uninvited.

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:36.833
And now you three
are going to wish

00:09:36.833 --> 00:09:38.966
that you never
stepped foot here.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.300
The hour of judgment
has come!

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.533
Sweeping Static Strike!

00:09:54.666 --> 00:09:57.000
(men shouting in terror)

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.600
Uhh!

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.800
(alarm whooping)

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.166
What now?

00:10:11.166 --> 00:10:12.600
We've picked up
an intense burst

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.666
of Synchro energy
in the Iceberg Zone.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.733
Sorry, but you two picked
on the wrong guy.

00:10:20.733 --> 00:10:23.466
I just wanted
to know where I was.

00:10:23.466 --> 00:10:26.033
Maybe now you'll learn to be
a little more hospitable

00:10:26.033 --> 00:10:27.766
when someone asks you
a question.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.066
Anybody else around here?

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:35.066
(shouting)
Hello?

00:10:43.366 --> 00:10:45.066
Huh?

00:10:45.066 --> 00:10:46.400
What's Yuya looking at?

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.633
Something's sure got
his attention.

00:10:50.933 --> 00:10:51.933
It's Shay!

00:10:51.933 --> 00:10:54.633
Ohh! Could Yuya
be going after him next?

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.600
(cracking)

00:11:00.366 --> 00:11:01.400
Yuya!

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.800
Watch out!

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.033
Yuya!

00:11:04.033 --> 00:11:05.033
(shrieking)

00:11:05.033 --> 00:11:06.566
(crash)

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.966
(groaning)

00:11:10.966 --> 00:11:12.433
(grunting)

00:11:12.433 --> 00:11:13.366
Aaaaah!

00:11:13.366 --> 00:11:14.366
(grunting)

00:11:14.366 --> 00:11:16.833
Get help... hurry!

00:11:16.833 --> 00:11:18.533
(gasping)

00:11:18.533 --> 00:11:20.200
(shouting)

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.000
(straining)
Please!

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.466
Uh, okay!

00:11:22.466 --> 00:11:25.000
(grunting and shouting)

00:11:26.466 --> 00:11:28.900
And now...

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.400
I'll add the last ingredients
of my recipe for victory!

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.066
By returning these monsters
to my hand,

00:11:35.066 --> 00:11:36.900
your monsters
are destroyed!

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.866
(both gasping)

00:11:37.866 --> 00:11:39.100
And for some kick,

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.033
I'm activating the trap
Metabolic Storm!

00:11:43.033 --> 00:11:44.966
This may be hard to swallow,

00:11:44.966 --> 00:11:46.766
but this trap deals
you so much damage

00:11:46.766 --> 00:11:48.200
that that I'm afraid
our seven‐course duel

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.433
has come
to a wind‐breaking end!

00:11:50.433 --> 00:11:53.566
My friends,
you've been served.

00:11:55.466 --> 00:11:56.533
Oh, yeah!

00:11:56.533 --> 00:11:58.000
We win again!

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.900
(both groan)

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.500
Gimme those Pendulum Cards,
and make it snappy!

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.800
Why do you
get Reed's cards?

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.333
That is not
very fair.

00:12:07.333 --> 00:12:09.066
No, but it is teamwork!

00:12:09.066 --> 00:12:12.600
Reed earns the cards,
and I hold on to 'em!

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.166
Keep this up and we'll win
a bazillion Pendulum Cards.

00:12:16.166 --> 00:12:18.100
Huh? Forget
the tournament!

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.700
Of course
I'll go help Yuya!

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.566
If you're his dueling partner,
then you're coming, too!

00:12:23.566 --> 00:12:24.500
Uh...

00:12:26.766 --> 00:12:29.366
(crowd jeering)

00:12:29.366 --> 00:12:30.600
Seriously?

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.700
Reed Pepper's feed
is now down now, too?

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.500
I hope they realize this
is how riots break out!

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.466
Well, heh heh...
that was unexpected!

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.700
I guess all our techies
have taken the day off,

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.200
but while we're
fixing the feed,

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.233
perhaps a visit to the souvenir
stand is in order?

00:12:45.233 --> 00:12:46.366
(crowd chattering angrily)
(boy)
This is so lame.

00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:47.566
(man)
I want my money back!

00:12:47.566 --> 00:12:49.333
(thinking)
What was Aura doing there?

00:12:49.333 --> 00:12:51.066
She's not in the tournament
anymore.

00:12:51.066 --> 00:12:53.966
And what did she want
with Reed and his partner?

00:12:53.966 --> 00:12:56.433
Why does she need them
to help Yuya?

00:12:56.433 --> 00:12:59.000
Sir, our systems
can't ID the duelist

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.266
<i>in the Iceberg Zone.</i>

00:13:00.266 --> 00:13:03.566
That signal
was exceptionally strong.

00:13:03.566 --> 00:13:07.166
It came from a highly powerful
Synchro Summon.

00:13:07.166 --> 00:13:09.133
Only a duelist
from the Synchro Dimension

00:13:09.133 --> 00:13:12.233
could command such energies.

00:13:12.233 --> 00:13:13.433
Find him!

00:13:13.433 --> 00:13:14.966
No matter what it takes!

00:13:14.966 --> 00:13:16.400
(all)
Right!

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.300
(Yuya shouting)

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.600
Do you have any idea what
happened to him?

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.000
Negative.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.500
When we ran into him, he was
already acting super strange.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.066
Maybe he cracked from
the pressure to win?

00:13:33.066 --> 00:13:35.733
Or maybe he's
under a spell or something.

00:13:35.733 --> 00:13:37.400
Time to find out!

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.266
I'll just us use
my soothsaying skills

00:13:39.266 --> 00:13:42.100
to see if anyone's taken
control of Yuya's mind.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.033
You can really
see that?

00:13:44.033 --> 00:13:45.200
Of course I can!

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.900
I've studied
with the best.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.566
Great mystical orb
of the unknown,

00:13:49.566 --> 00:13:51.400
reveal Yuya's plight!

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.133
Allow me to see
beyond plain sight!

00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:56.300
I can see...

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.066
something strange...

00:13:58.066 --> 00:13:59.100
(gasps)

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.333
What's wrong?

00:14:00.333 --> 00:14:01.800
What is it, Aura?

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.033
(Aura)
There are two souls

00:14:03.033 --> 00:14:04.766
residing inside
my darling!

00:14:04.766 --> 00:14:06.233
(all)
Say what now?!

00:14:06.233 --> 00:14:09.200
Yuya and... someone else.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.200
Wait! I'm also
sensing a third.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.166
A darker, scarier presence.

00:14:14.166 --> 00:14:16.266
Well, who or what is it?

00:14:16.266 --> 00:14:18.500
I can't be sure, but...

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.733
it's definitely there,
and it's terrifying!

00:14:21.733 --> 00:14:23.700
Is that what's
making 'em nuts?

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.200
Ahh, the kid's
gonna be just fine.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.966
Aaaah!

00:14:27.966 --> 00:14:29.233
(groans)

00:14:29.233 --> 00:14:30.833
Yuya?
He's out cold!

00:14:30.833 --> 00:14:31.766
My sweetie!

00:14:33.366 --> 00:14:36.466
Mr. President, our ninjas
have escaped the intruders

00:14:36.466 --> 00:14:38.833
and led Zuzu and Celina
to safety...

00:14:38.833 --> 00:14:40.933
at least for now.

00:14:40.933 --> 00:14:42.033
Hmm...

00:14:43.266 --> 00:14:45.433
(Celina grunting)

00:14:48.233 --> 00:14:50.133
Hey! Let me go!

00:14:50.133 --> 00:14:52.366
You can treat me like
I'm a sack of potatoes!

00:14:52.366 --> 00:14:55.533
Uhh! I had everything under
control 'til you barged in!

00:14:55.533 --> 00:14:56.733
Now put me down!

00:14:56.733 --> 00:14:58.300
Uhh!

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.000
Why'd you butt in
to my business?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.266
I don't even
know who you are.

00:15:02.266 --> 00:15:04.966
You better give me
some answers or else!

00:15:04.966 --> 00:15:07.600
Moon Shadow,
mind these two.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.233
I will take
a look around.

00:15:09.233 --> 00:15:11.300
Her attackers
could be tracking us.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.666
Be careful, brother.

00:15:14.033 --> 00:15:15.866
So who were
those guys?

00:15:15.866 --> 00:15:18.500
Warriors from
the Fusion Dimension,

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.333
sent here by Duel Academy.

00:15:20.333 --> 00:15:21.633
Really?

00:15:21.633 --> 00:15:23.100
The Fusion Dimension?

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.500
That's why they're after us‐‐
I mean, you Lulu!

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.433
How'd you escape?
It must have been terrifying.

00:15:28.433 --> 00:15:31.066
Shay's gonna be so happy
to see you again, Lulu!

00:15:31.066 --> 00:15:32.833
Do I look like
a Lulu to you?

00:15:32.833 --> 00:15:34.666
My name is Celina!

00:15:34.666 --> 00:15:36.533
Celina?

00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:38.433
But you're right,
those goons back there

00:15:38.433 --> 00:15:40.033
did come here
to try and capture me.

00:15:40.033 --> 00:15:41.700
But they're going back
empty‐handed.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.466
They picked the wrong girl
to mess with.

00:15:44.466 --> 00:15:46.800
If Tweedle‐dum
and Tweedle‐dumber
hadn't interfered,

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.600
I would have
driven them all away!

00:15:50.433 --> 00:15:51.633
I don't get it.

00:15:51.633 --> 00:15:53.166
Why are they after you?

00:15:53.166 --> 00:15:56.533
The Professor sent them after
I refused to obey his orders.

00:15:56.533 --> 00:15:59.366
He rules Duel Academy
with an iron fist,

00:15:59.366 --> 00:16:02.166
and his orders
are the supreme law.

00:16:02.166 --> 00:16:04.066
Disobedience
is never tolerated.

00:16:04.066 --> 00:16:05.800
But I only listen to me,

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.133
so when he said I had to stay
put, I made other plans.

00:16:09.133 --> 00:16:11.233
I know there are fugitives
from Xyz here,

00:16:11.233 --> 00:16:13.466
and I'm determined
to find and crush them!

00:16:13.466 --> 00:16:16.166
The Professor will realize then
how badly he blundered

00:16:16.166 --> 00:16:17.766
when he didn't send me
to the front lines

00:16:17.766 --> 00:16:19.800
with the others‐‐
I promise!

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.300
And that's why you
wanted to duel Dennis?

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.100
I thought he was an Xyzian,
but it seems I was wrong.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.566
(muttering)
Apology accepted.

00:16:26.566 --> 00:16:29.566
So are these "front lines"
in the Xyz Dimension?

00:16:29.566 --> 00:16:30.966
That's right.

00:16:30.966 --> 00:16:33.733
I wanted to go and fight to make
the universe a better place.

00:16:33.733 --> 00:16:36.666
I watched as my fellow
recruits all traveled to Xyz.

00:16:36.666 --> 00:16:39.133
They won glory on the field...

00:16:39.133 --> 00:16:42.966
and I had to stay behind,
all thanks to the Professor.

00:16:42.966 --> 00:16:45.433
Do you have any clue
what your precious academy

00:16:45.433 --> 00:16:47.733
did in the Xyz Dimension?

00:16:47.733 --> 00:16:49.600
It was just horrible.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.500
Their world was once
a peaceful one.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.700
But it all changed.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.933
Nothing could have
prepared us.

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:59.466
It happened too quickly.

00:16:59.466 --> 00:17:02.266
They just showed up,
they wrecked our city,

00:17:02.266 --> 00:17:04.566
changing our lives forever.

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:08.200
The enemy took
everything away from us.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.033
I heard the Xyzians
were chased

00:17:10.033 --> 00:17:12.133
and tracked down for fun
by your fellow recruits.

00:17:12.133 --> 00:17:13.833
I don't understand
why anyone would

00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:15.633
want to be a part
of such a thing.

00:17:15.633 --> 00:17:17.666
It just sounds
so horrible.

00:17:17.666 --> 00:17:19.366
But if you
think that's okay...

00:17:19.366 --> 00:17:20.800
I'm gonna stop you!

00:17:26.933 --> 00:17:29.266
At last,
the final showdown!

00:17:29.266 --> 00:17:31.433
Now my revenge
will be complete!

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.133
Looks like
a three‐on‐three duel...

00:17:46.133 --> 00:17:47.666
But earlier,
there were six duelists

00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:49.200
from the Fusion Dimension.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.466
So where are
the other three?

00:17:51.466 --> 00:17:54.066
(Celina)
That was quite the story
you told me, Zuzu.

00:17:54.066 --> 00:17:56.533
You should be careful where
you get your information from,

00:17:56.533 --> 00:17:58.033
because everything
you told me...

00:17:58.033 --> 00:17:59.966
is a lie.

00:17:59.966 --> 00:18:01.000
(gasps)

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.833
Your story can't be true.

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.633
You don't know
my classmates.

00:18:05.633 --> 00:18:06.633
They're not the type
of duelists

00:18:06.633 --> 00:18:08.666
to go and hunt others
for fun and games.

00:18:08.666 --> 00:18:11.266
Oh, yeah? Then why
did they go there?

00:18:11.266 --> 00:18:14.266
Duel Academy's goal
is pure and noble.

00:18:14.266 --> 00:18:15.466
It is to unite
all the dimensions

00:18:15.466 --> 00:18:16.866
into one supreme world!

00:18:16.866 --> 00:18:18.566
Supreme world?

00:18:18.566 --> 00:18:22.433
We simply invaded the Xyz
Dimension to achieve our goal.

00:18:22.433 --> 00:18:24.733
In time, we will
also assimilate

00:18:24.733 --> 00:18:28.200
the Synchro and Standard
Dimensions until all are one!

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.100
The duelists of Duel Academy

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:34.133
train tirelessly to serve
this great and honorable dream!

00:18:34.133 --> 00:18:37.533
Someday we will bring all
our worlds together into one!

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:39.633
But don't you see‐‐
along the way you'll be

00:18:39.633 --> 00:18:41.833
causing immense suffering?

00:18:41.833 --> 00:18:43.766
Every great dream
has a price.

00:18:43.766 --> 00:18:45.766
Those who fought back knew
what they were getting into.

00:18:45.766 --> 00:18:47.100
(grunting)

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.333
But how about all the ones
that didn't fight back

00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:51.633
and were hunted down?
Huh?

00:18:51.633 --> 00:18:54.633
It wasn't just duelists who
were attacked by your people.

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:57.466
Those invaders went after
anyone and everyone!

00:18:57.466 --> 00:19:01.233
You mean even people
who weren't duelists?

00:19:01.233 --> 00:19:02.766
I know a duelist
from Xyz

00:19:02.766 --> 00:19:05.066
who's fighting
to rescue his sister.

00:19:05.066 --> 00:19:08.000
She was taken prisoner
by your people!

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.600
We wouldn't do that...
would we?

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.700
Are you sure about that?

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.100
You better believe it.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.433
His name
is Shay Obsidian.

00:19:15.433 --> 00:19:16.566
Ask him about his sister

00:19:16.566 --> 00:19:18.833
and what happened
in his home world.

00:19:18.833 --> 00:19:21.533
Maybe that will convince you
I'm telling the truth.

00:19:26.533 --> 00:19:28.366
(grunting softly)

00:19:28.366 --> 00:19:30.866
Yuya!
You okay?

00:19:30.866 --> 00:19:33.833
Please don't let his eyes turn
red and freaky again!

00:19:33.833 --> 00:19:35.466
(Yuya)
What's going on?

00:19:35.466 --> 00:19:36.266
Sweetie pie!

00:19:36.266 --> 00:19:38.466
That you... Aura?

00:19:38.466 --> 00:19:40.466
Thank the stars! Ohh!

00:19:40.466 --> 00:19:43.200
My dreamboat has sailed
safely back to me!

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.066
(whimpering)

00:19:47.533 --> 00:19:49.800
I don't remember much.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.533
My last memory was of
this soldier guy

00:19:52.533 --> 00:19:55.566
attacking and turning
a duelist into a card.

00:19:55.566 --> 00:19:59.233
Gong has flattened his opponents
before, but never like that!

00:19:59.233 --> 00:20:02.533
Everything that happened after
that is a blank.

00:20:02.533 --> 00:20:04.966
Did I end up
dueling those guys?

00:20:04.966 --> 00:20:07.700
Yep, and whooped 'em
with a mega‐mean dragon

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.833
Gong never saw before.

00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:13.333
(Aura)
Whatever bamboozled your brain
seems to be gone for now.

00:20:13.333 --> 00:20:14.500
Huh?

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.566
When you were passed out,

00:20:15.566 --> 00:20:18.033
I sensed another
presence in you.

00:20:18.033 --> 00:20:19.966
There was also
some kind of darkness

00:20:19.966 --> 00:20:21.600
trying to take over
the both of you.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.333
All of this was
happening inside of me?

00:20:24.333 --> 00:20:26.400
It all sounds
so farfetched.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.566
Maybe you were
imagining those things.

00:20:28.566 --> 00:20:31.366
No... what I saw
was really there.

00:20:31.366 --> 00:20:36.200
(thinking)
She sensed another presence
inside of me.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.900
Could it be Yuto?

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.033
That would explain
why I was able to feel

00:20:41.033 --> 00:20:42.366
what happened
to his people.

00:20:44.233 --> 00:20:47.766
I wonder if his anger
is what's taking control of me.

00:20:47.766 --> 00:20:49.800
But that can't be because...

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.166
the last thing
Yuto said to me was...

00:20:52.166 --> 00:20:54.600
(weakly)
Always remember...

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.000
use your power...

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.166
to keep the world
entertained...

00:20:59.166 --> 00:21:00.633
and smiling.

00:21:00.633 --> 00:21:04.033
So if we're both trying
to keep the world smiling,

00:21:04.033 --> 00:21:06.766
who or what was causing me
to be so mean?

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.866
All right...

00:21:11.866 --> 00:21:14.000
I'm going to track down
this Shay character

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.600
you told me about.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.233
I have to find out
if what you said is true.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.500
But first, I have an idea
that might make it harder

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.533
for those Fusion folks
to find you!

00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:25.700
Tell me.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.600
If you and I
switch outfits,

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.066
they'll think you're me
and that I'm you!

00:21:30.066 --> 00:21:31.366
I get it!

00:21:31.366 --> 00:21:32.666
You're hoping
to draw their attention

00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:34.566
by acting as my decoy,
aren't you?

00:21:34.566 --> 00:21:35.833
That's the plan.

00:21:35.833 --> 00:21:38.600
(chuckling softly)

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:42.566
Hmm. It's not a bad fit!

00:21:44.233 --> 00:21:46.133
Mm...

00:21:46.133 --> 00:21:48.066
Shay wasn't in
the Jungle Zone

00:21:48.066 --> 00:21:49.500
or at the Volcano.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.500
Which leaves...

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.800
The Ruins!

00:22:00.566 --> 00:22:02.433
Oh!

00:22:02.433 --> 00:22:03.266
Oh, hey.

00:22:03.266 --> 00:22:05.333
It's you.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.300
So how's it going...
Yuri?

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:09.433
♪
