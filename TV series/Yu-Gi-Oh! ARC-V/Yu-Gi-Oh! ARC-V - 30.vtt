WEBVTT

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.333
Uh!

00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:05.333
(gasps)

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.000
So you're gonna battle for
your father, are you?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.766
Then how 'bout I take
The Sledgehammer's place?

00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:12.833
Back off,
Grizzlepike.

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:14.400
That's enough!

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.266
You think it makes you bigger or
stronger or cooler to pick on

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:20.000
somebody that's
smaller than you are?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.766
Gong's opponent in his first
match is Grizzlepike.

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.100
Gong and Grizzlepike were once
training partners&amp;

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.466
But Gong and Grizzlepike train
together no longer!

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.700
Not only did Grizzlepike
disrespect Yuya,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.500
but he disrespected everything
Gong's Duel Dojo stands for!

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.500
For that,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.066
Gong will attack

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.800
like a bolt
from the blue!

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.333
That's the spirit,
my boy!

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.166
Daddy,
is that you?

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.700
'Course it's me!

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.133
You have proven
yourself worthy

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.566
of wearing our Dojo's
most sacred sash.

00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.433
Keep it with you always
as a reminder

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:56.266
that if you stand strong,
you can stand up to any storm!

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.533
Gong will!

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.533

(announcer)
Welcome one and all to the duel
tournament that matches

00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:10.666
the biggest and brightest stars
of tomorrow today!

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:13.666
That's right, win here and these
amateurs will be one step closer

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.266
to being propelled
into the pro leagues!

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:19.233
Zuzu started things off right
yesterday with a big win.

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:21.400
Now it's up to Gong,
Sora and I.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.166
Now it's
our turn to duel!

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.500
And nothing's gonna
take us down!

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.100
Yaaaah!

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.466
Except you!

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:33.100
Oops, I dropped
the sash.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.466
Can you
pick it up for me?

00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:36.333
I was told to deliver it to
someone who really needs it.

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:38.000
Hey,
that's Gong's.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.466
He never duels
without it.

00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:41.566
Hey!

00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:42.700
Stop!

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.733
Hurry!

00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:44.733
Gong's up next!

00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:46.100
(announcer)
Please take your seats!

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.933
Our first duel of the day
will be starting in seconds!

00:02:48.933 --> 00:02:50.066
Where's Yuya?

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:51.733
He said that
he'd be waiting for us.

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:52.800
Look!
He's there!

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.433
At least,
he was right there.

00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:01.033
What's Pinky over there
want with Gong's sash?

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:04.400
My best guess is
he's working for Grizzlepike!

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.933
I think he's trying
to mess with Gong

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:08.000
by taking something
important to him!

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.266
What a creep!

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:12.800
Hey, I recognize you now‐‐
Aren't you Yuya Sakaki?

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.966
Don't you have
a duel of your own today?

00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:17.533
Yeah, but that's not what's
important right now.

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:21.300
Right now, we gotta get
that sash back for Gong!

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.966
(cheering and applause)

00:03:28.966 --> 00:03:32.133
Welcome duel fans to the
second day of our tournament!

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:33.700
I know you're cheering
because you're excited,

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.966
but I'm going to bow
like it's for me!

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:37.133
Thanks,
I needed that.

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:38.400
Now,
without further ado,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.933
let's bring in the two duelists
in our initial contest!

00:03:41.933 --> 00:03:44.166
I'd say this first fellow
needs no introduction,

00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:46.466
but then I'd be out of a job,
so here goes.

00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:50.833
He's big, he's bad,
he's Grizzlepike Jones!

00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:52.166
And his opponent,

00:03:52.166 --> 00:03:55.500
representing Paradise City's
prestigious Duel Dojo,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.833
he's tough,
he's rough!

00:03:56.833 --> 00:03:59.766
He's Gong Strong!

00:03:59.766 --> 00:04:01.366
Nice sash
you got there.

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.466
Your dad give it
to ya?

00:04:03.466 --> 00:04:05.233
He's not just
Gong's daddy.

00:04:05.233 --> 00:04:07.733
He happens to be
Gong's master as well!

00:04:07.733 --> 00:04:09.000
And as you know,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.466
a new sash is given before
every important match!

00:04:13.466 --> 00:04:14.866
Of course
I know that,

00:04:14.866 --> 00:04:17.466
but it's a real good thing
everyone doesn't.

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:18.533
What?

00:04:18.533 --> 00:04:19.966
And now...

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:22.533
Let's select our field spell,
shall we?

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:27.966
Round and round it goes,
where it lands, now we know!

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:29.000
All right!

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.600
Let's...

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.233
Bust it out!

00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:36.700
I activate the Action Field
spell, Calamity Cove!

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.133
(computer voice)
Augmented reality
combat system energized.

00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:43.833
Works for me.

00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:46.200
But
I wonder...

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.000
How are things working out
for Yuya right now?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.066
For Yuya?

00:04:56.166 --> 00:04:57.466
Huh?

00:05:00.966 --> 00:05:02.833
Uh, what's going on?

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.066
(snickering)

00:05:06.066 --> 00:05:07.933
Where're you going?

00:05:08.966 --> 00:05:10.166
You dope!

00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:11.466
You fell
for it!

00:05:11.466 --> 00:05:14.066
You never shoulda got on
Grizzlepike's bad side!

00:05:14.066 --> 00:05:15.533
Huh?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.433
Talk now!

00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:22.400
Tell Gong what you've
done to Yuya!

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.500
What's wrong, Gong?

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.266
You seem angry
and out of sorts,

00:05:25.266 --> 00:05:28.233
I thought your dojo was
supposed to teach discipline!

00:05:28.233 --> 00:05:30.033
(growling)

00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:33.233
Or maybe your dojo isn't as
great as you think it is.

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:35.600
And your dad,
the so‐called master,

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.166
is just a giant phony!

00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:39.900
Now maybe you'll
finally understand

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.200
why I stopped
training there!

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.733
You punk!

00:05:43.733 --> 00:05:46.233
But back to Yuya
and the danger he's in,,,

00:05:46.233 --> 00:05:47.933
(gasps)

00:05:47.933 --> 00:05:51.200
He's outnumbered and
about to be done‐in duel style!

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.400
In order
to save him,

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.333
I think you know what
you're gonna have to do...

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:57.100
And that's take off and
go rescue him right now.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.800
Of course, then you'll
have to forfeit the match!

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.933
Wish I could hear what
those two were talking about.

00:06:01.933 --> 00:06:03.533
Better yet,

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:04.866
I wish I knew where
on earth Yuya ran off to!

00:06:04.866 --> 00:06:06.633
‐ Zuzu?
‐ Hey, Yuya!

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:09.500
Can't really talk right now
but don't worry, I'm okay.

00:06:10.733 --> 00:06:13.966
And let Gong know his
sash'll be okay, too.

00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:15.400
Yuya?

00:06:18.133 --> 00:06:19.566
To forfeit the match
against you

00:06:19.566 --> 00:06:23.633
would be to dishonor Gong's dojo
and Gong's master!

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:26.800
So you're choosing to duel
over saving Yuya?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.300
Wrong!

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.033
Gong will do both!

00:06:34.033 --> 00:06:36.400
You mean, beat me‐‐
(grunts)

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.766
and then go find Yuya
and save him?

00:06:40.766 --> 00:06:42.600
That's the plan!

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.233
Well, not a very good one
if you ask me...

00:06:45.233 --> 00:06:48.033
'Cause Yuya
won't last that long!

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:49.200
Let's duel!

00:06:53.733 --> 00:06:56.466
(computer voice)
<i>Action Cards dispersed.</i>

00:06:56.466 --> 00:06:58.433
I'll go ahead and
make the first move.

00:06:58.433 --> 00:07:00.233
And with it...

00:07:00.233 --> 00:07:02.800
I summon
Granite Battleguard!

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:06.900
And due to
its special ability,

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.166
I'm allowed to bring out
another brute,

00:07:09.166 --> 00:07:12.700
Boulder Battleguard!

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.866
Oh, my!

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:15.400
The duel's
just begun, and already

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.733
Grizzlepike has two mangling
monsters on his field!

00:07:18.733 --> 00:07:20.866
I'll end my turn
with a facedown.

00:07:23.633 --> 00:07:26.533
Now, let's see what
you've got for me, Gong!

00:07:26.533 --> 00:07:29.733
And see if you've got
what it takes to save Yuya!

00:07:29.733 --> 00:07:30.666
(growling)

00:07:33.233 --> 00:07:35.733
Oh, Gong's got what
it takes, all right!

00:07:35.733 --> 00:07:37.266
And more!

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.433
First of all, because you have
two Neanderthal numbskulls

00:07:42.433 --> 00:07:43.866
on your side
of the field...

00:07:43.866 --> 00:07:45.100
Gong is allowed
to summon

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.866
this big, bad Samurai
from Gong's hand!

00:07:47.866 --> 00:07:52.066
Come on out,
Superheavy Samurai Big Waraji!

00:07:54.066 --> 00:07:56.266
And since Waraji
is so big,

00:07:56.266 --> 00:07:59.000
it counts as two monsters
when Gong Tribute Summons,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.766
and that's just what Gong's
gonna do!

00:08:01.766 --> 00:08:04.333
So now, thanks
to my Superheavy Samurai,

00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:07.933
Gong can bring out the
Superheavy Samurai Big Benkei

00:08:07.933 --> 00:08:09.700
in defense mode!

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.000
A masterful
move!

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.633
Just like that,

00:08:13.633 --> 00:08:15.733
Gong's protected from
Grizzlepike's pummeling pair!

00:08:15.733 --> 00:08:18.200
And Big Benkei can do more
than just protect.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.300
It can attack with
its defense points, too!

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.633
Yeah, all 3,500
of them!

00:08:22.633 --> 00:08:24.866
I'd like
that many pretzels!

00:08:24.866 --> 00:08:28.000
Sometimes I wonder why we
bring you along, Frederick.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.100
Yuya said he was okay
on the phone

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.100
but something tells me
he may not be.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.533
And what did he mean
about Gong's sash?

00:08:34.533 --> 00:08:37.366
Since there are no spell or trap
cards in Gong's graveyard,

00:08:37.366 --> 00:08:40.733
by sending one Superheavy
Samurai to the graveyard,

00:08:40.733 --> 00:08:42.866
Gong can
summon this card.

00:08:42.866 --> 00:08:44.966
Superheavy Samurai
Trumpeter!

00:08:44.966 --> 00:08:45.900
Huh!

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.400
(trumpet playing)

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.300
All right,
it's a Tuner Monster!

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.800
And I think we all know
what comes next!

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.500
Synchro Summon!

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.000
Nice try, Gong...

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.100
But I play...

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.100
A trap!

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.400
Battleguard Sorcery!

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.033
This'll let me turn the heat up,
get my groove on

00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:13.300
and make sure
the hits keep coming!

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.000
Now, I get to take control
of one of your monsters!

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.100
What?

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.200
And I think
that I'll go...

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.833
with Trumpeter!

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:29.033
That's bad, ja?

00:09:29.033 --> 00:09:31.266
Yeah, now Gong can't
Synchro Summon!

00:09:31.266 --> 00:09:34.166
Ha ha ha ha!

00:09:34.166 --> 00:09:37.166
You're as predictable
as your dojo is pathetic,

00:09:37.166 --> 00:09:39.033
I knew what
you were planning there!

00:09:39.033 --> 00:09:41.566
You see,
I have discipline, too,

00:09:41.566 --> 00:09:43.300
and I used it
to research you

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.566
and your secret
Synchro sessions.

00:09:45.566 --> 00:09:48.266
And because I did,
time will keep counting down

00:09:48.266 --> 00:09:49.933
for your
little friend&amp;

00:09:49.933 --> 00:09:52.866
That is, if it's not
already too late for him!

00:09:52.866 --> 00:09:54.600
Yuya...

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.633
Stay strong.

00:09:55.633 --> 00:09:56.566
Oh!

00:09:57.633 --> 00:09:59.766
Four‐on‐one
isn't fair at all&amp;

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.900
But I gotta hang on
for Gong!

00:10:07.433 --> 00:10:08.800
(announcer)
What a duel
this is turning out to be

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.733
with our two card slingers
slapping down

00:10:10.733 --> 00:10:12.133
their
very best beasts

00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:14.200
and not backing down
in the least!

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.200
But even though
Gong is standing strong,

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.366
Grizzlepike seems
to have the advantage.

00:10:18.366 --> 00:10:22.166
After all, he has Trumpeter,
one of Gong's monsters!

00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:25.366
Gotta say, Kit,
Gong's not looking too good.

00:10:25.366 --> 00:10:28.033
Did you teach him how to get
his monster stolen like that?

00:10:28.033 --> 00:10:29.100
Gong!

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.166
You better
turn this around!

00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:31.400
I'm counting
on you...

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.633
To make me
look good!

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.933
Yuya,
this is for you!

00:10:35.933 --> 00:10:37.233
Big Benkei!

00:10:37.233 --> 00:10:39.400
Rock Granite
Battleguard!

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.366
Nope.

00:10:45.366 --> 00:10:48.400
I activate Boulder
Battleguard's ability!

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.000
It puts a stop to an attack
against my battling brute!

00:10:54.466 --> 00:10:55.466
That's not good!

00:10:56.566 --> 00:10:57.600
Curses!

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.300
Now even more time's
been wasted!

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.400
I don't get it.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.100
Why's he
in such a hurry?

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.833
What's the matter
with you, Gong?

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.166
Having a hard time?

00:11:09.166 --> 00:11:11.766
Can't stand up
to this here storm?

00:11:11.766 --> 00:11:15.266
Thought your dojo was all about
being strong and unshakeable&amp;

00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:17.266
Yeah, I remember
your dojo's creed.

00:11:17.266 --> 00:11:19.166
I always thought
it was garbage.

00:11:19.166 --> 00:11:21.966
If only Yuya knew that you
had a chance to save him...

00:11:21.966 --> 00:11:25.233
But instead decided to stay
and fight for your honor.

00:11:25.233 --> 00:11:27.233
I wonder what
he would think? Ha!

00:11:27.233 --> 00:11:28.866
No!

00:11:28.866 --> 00:11:29.900
Stop it!

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.033
That's it.

00:11:31.033 --> 00:11:33.033
Let my words sink in
like daggers.

00:11:33.033 --> 00:11:35.633
Daggers that rip your
duel training to shreds.

00:11:35.633 --> 00:11:37.700
That always was
your weakness, Gong.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.566
Your friends.

00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:41.766
Face it, Gong,
you have no honor

00:11:41.766 --> 00:11:44.300
and your dojo
has taught you nothing!

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.833
(Zuzu) Don't listen
to him, Gong!

00:11:47.966 --> 00:11:50.033
Yuya's
gonna be okay!

00:11:51.233 --> 00:11:52.700
What do you mean?

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.900
I heard from him earlier and
he said for us not to worry!

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.233
And that he's going
to get you your sash back!

00:11:59.233 --> 00:12:00.766
Get Gong's sash?

00:12:00.766 --> 00:12:03.133
We all know how much
you care about Yuya, Gong...

00:12:03.133 --> 00:12:05.733
But now you have
to trust in him, too!

00:12:05.733 --> 00:12:07.500
Yes, I agree!

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.300
Believe in
your friend Yuya.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.500
But also
believe that&amp;

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.366
You are unshakeable and can
stand up to anything!

00:12:15.366 --> 00:12:17.100
Gong believes!

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.633
Ha ha ha!

00:12:18.633 --> 00:12:20.833
So Yuya thinks
that he's okay...

00:12:20.833 --> 00:12:22.233
Well, I got
some bad news.

00:12:22.233 --> 00:12:24.100
That doesn't
make it so!

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.233
Oh, yes,
it does!

00:12:25.233 --> 00:12:26.666
Gong can feel
his strength!

00:12:29.133 --> 00:12:31.066
I'm getting back
Gong's sash...

00:12:31.066 --> 00:12:32.066
No matter what!

00:12:32.066 --> 00:12:34.233
Gong trusts Yuya
with all Gong's heart!

00:12:34.233 --> 00:12:36.100
Yuya's
a helpless kid.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.700
Gong used
to think that.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.233
But Yuya's not the same
duelist he was when we first
met!

00:12:41.233 --> 00:12:42.933
Yeah, he's come
a long way!

00:12:45.433 --> 00:12:49.100
And since this duel began, Gong,
too, has come a long way!

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.300
Gong once again feels the power
of his dojo!

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.500
You go, Gong!

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.333
I feel you
feeling the power!

00:12:56.333 --> 00:12:57.500
Oh, yeah!

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.000
Let it flow!

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.166
He sure is letting
the tears flow.

00:13:01.166 --> 00:13:03.466
And now,
I'll end my turn.

00:13:03.466 --> 00:13:04.666
You're kidding.

00:13:04.666 --> 00:13:07.066
Next time, cheer him on
when his turn starts.

00:13:07.066 --> 00:13:10.233
Gong's move may be over,
but if Gong knows Yuya,

00:13:10.233 --> 00:13:13.966
he's making his
big move right about now.

00:13:17.933 --> 00:13:21.133
Ladies, Grizzlepiketlemen,
your attention!

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:23.533
That's right,
it's showtime!

00:13:26.533 --> 00:13:28.033
So
please enjoy...

00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:29.333
Because after this show,

00:13:29.333 --> 00:13:32.000
it's curtains for the rest
of your life points!

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.666
Bravo!

00:13:35.666 --> 00:13:36.666
What a show!

00:13:36.666 --> 00:13:38.366
(laughing)

00:13:42.333 --> 00:13:44.866
This doesn't
change a thing!

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:47.366
And do you
know why?

00:13:47.366 --> 00:13:50.900
'Cause you're too far behind
in this duel to come back!

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.500
It's my draw!

00:13:55.466 --> 00:13:59.833
I tribute my three monsters to
summon the menacingly mystical

00:13:59.833 --> 00:14:01.666
Shaman Battleguard!

00:14:05.966 --> 00:14:07.700
(explosion)

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.500
(monster laughing wildly)

00:14:16.033 --> 00:14:18.000
Whoa!
What is that?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.333
That's very
un‐wunderbar!

00:14:20.333 --> 00:14:23.066
That monster's moves
put the twist in twisted.

00:14:23.066 --> 00:14:25.633
I can't wait to see
what he does next.

00:14:29.066 --> 00:14:30.233
And now...

00:14:30.233 --> 00:14:33.700
I activate Shaman
Battleguard's special ability!

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.933
It's one you may find
familiar and quite frustrating.

00:14:37.933 --> 00:14:41.966
I'm allowed to steal away
one of your monsters!

00:14:45.866 --> 00:14:47.500
He swiped
Big Benkei!

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.200
That's
wunderbad!

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.300
And I'm not
finished yet.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.700
First, I took
your monster,

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.300
and now I'll use it
to take your life points!

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.533
Go, Big Benkei!

00:14:56.533 --> 00:14:58.466
Attack Gong directly!

00:14:58.466 --> 00:15:01.000
(explosion)

00:15:02.366 --> 00:15:03.766
Run away!

00:15:03.766 --> 00:15:06.466
But that goes against
everything Gong believes in.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.633
(announcer)
Ouch!

00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:35.233
Gong is running out
of life points

00:15:35.233 --> 00:15:37.866
and out of room
on that cliff edge!

00:15:37.866 --> 00:15:38.966
This is bad.

00:15:38.966 --> 00:15:40.233
If he's
hit again‐‐

00:15:40.233 --> 00:15:41.266
He'll fall!

00:15:41.266 --> 00:15:43.766
He's toast,
it's game over.

00:15:43.766 --> 00:15:46.133
There's no way Gong
can come back from this.

00:15:46.133 --> 00:15:48.766
And no way to restore my rep
if he loses!

00:15:48.766 --> 00:15:50.966
(chuckling)

00:15:50.966 --> 00:15:53.466
Looks like we've got
a real cliffhanger.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.700
But don't worry.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.033
This duel's gonna
be over soon!

00:15:58.033 --> 00:16:00.100
'Cause you're over,
Gong!

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.700
Everything you
and your dojo stand for

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.133
are crashing down
hard below!

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:11.133
That is, unless you give up now,
then maybe I'll spare you.

00:16:11.133 --> 00:16:13.166
Gong'll
never give up!

00:16:13.166 --> 00:16:15.433
'Specially not to the likes
of you!

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:17.800
All right then,
you had your chance,

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.766
but now it looks like
I have no other choice...

00:16:20.766 --> 00:16:24.233
Shaman Battleguard,
attack Gong directly!

00:16:25.733 --> 00:16:27.033
Not so fast!

00:16:27.033 --> 00:16:29.733
Gong banishes
Superheavy Samurai Gigagloves

00:16:29.733 --> 00:16:32.233
to activate its
special ability!

00:16:32.233 --> 00:16:34.433
That allows Gong to draw a card
from his deck.

00:16:34.433 --> 00:16:36.666
And if that card is
a Superheavy Samurai,

00:16:36.666 --> 00:16:39.733
then your monster's attack
points become zero!

00:16:46.466 --> 00:16:47.600
Draw!

00:16:50.766 --> 00:16:51.700
Yeah!

00:16:55.166 --> 00:16:56.366
(yelling)

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.666
Nice try!

00:17:02.666 --> 00:17:03.533
(explosion)

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.766
Gong's dojo teaches to fight
'til the end,

00:17:11.766 --> 00:17:14.066
even if you're on
the end of a cliff!

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:15.566
(cheering)
(announcer) Simply sensational!

00:17:15.566 --> 00:17:17.200
Gong was about
to be taken down,

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.700
way down, but he was
able to hang in there

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.300
with a smoking hot
duel strategy!

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.000
That wasn't strategy,
that was luck.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
But luck won't win this because
as long I have Big Benkei,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.900
you're not allowed
to attack my Shaman Battleguard!

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.366
And even if you happen to bring
out a monster that's stronger

00:17:34.366 --> 00:17:36.266
than Big Benkei
to take it out,

00:17:36.266 --> 00:17:37.700
that won't matter
one little bit

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.633
because I'll use
my Shaman Battleguard

00:17:39.633 --> 00:17:42.533
to take control of your
new monster anyway!

00:17:42.533 --> 00:17:45.466
In other words,
you simply can't win!

00:17:46.633 --> 00:17:48.733
So now
I'll end my turn!

00:17:50.033 --> 00:17:52.800
The battle sash Gong
received from his daddy...

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.433
A shame!

00:17:55.433 --> 00:17:58.800
But Gong will have to just
keep dueling without it.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.166
It's gonna be tough.

00:18:00.166 --> 00:18:03.166
Gong hopes he doesn't get
torn apart like that sash.

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:04.400
(Yuya)
Gong!

00:18:08.366 --> 00:18:09.233
Yuya!

00:18:09.233 --> 00:18:11.000
He's okay!

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Yuya.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.300
In the flesh!

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.200
Now catch!

00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:22.533
Yuya!

00:18:22.533 --> 00:18:24.200
Gong's glad you're safe.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.933
And for the sash
Gong thanks you!

00:18:26.933 --> 00:18:29.100
Time to wrap up
this duel.

00:18:30.333 --> 00:18:31.500
Grizzlepike!

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.000
Let's get back
to battling!

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.800
My draw!

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.133
To get things rolling&amp;

00:18:41.133 --> 00:18:43.300
Gong summons
another Tuner monster,

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.966
Superheavy Samurai
Battleball!

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.033
A Tuner Monster?

00:18:49.033 --> 00:18:51.333
But what's the point if you
don't have another monster out

00:18:51.333 --> 00:18:52.500
to tune it with?

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.433
You're missing the point,
Grizzlepike.

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:55.900
Gong doesn't need
another monster

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.733
to tune
with Battleball...

00:18:57.733 --> 00:18:59.533
Not if you
have one!

00:18:59.533 --> 00:19:01.300
What'd you say?

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.000
Battleball's ability
lets Gong tune it

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.666
with a monster
on your field.

00:19:05.666 --> 00:19:09.600
A monster like Big Benkei,
to be exact!

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.200
There's no way you're ready
for what's next!

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.066
This monster is gonna bring you
some big‐league pain!

00:19:18.466 --> 00:19:21.133
Gong Synchro Summons!

00:19:21.133 --> 00:19:25.266
Level 10 Superheavy Samurai
Warlord Susanowo!

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.866
Yeah, I taught him
to do that!

00:19:30.866 --> 00:19:31.800
Hooray!

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.800
Next, Gong equips Superheavy
Samurai Soulbuster Gauntlet

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.600
on Susanowo!

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:46.533
Now Susanowo gains
400 defense points!

00:19:50.066 --> 00:19:52.200
Wait...
No way!

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.066
I'm not liking
where this is going.

00:19:54.066 --> 00:19:55.366
But Gong does!

00:19:55.366 --> 00:19:57.266
Because in just a matter
of moments, Grizzlepike,

00:19:57.266 --> 00:19:58.933
you're through!

00:19:58.933 --> 00:20:02.733
After all, Susanowo uses its
defense points to attack

00:20:02.733 --> 00:20:04.566
while
in defense mode!

00:20:04.566 --> 00:20:06.733
And since that Shaman
has no attack points,

00:20:06.733 --> 00:20:09.400
it's gonna be completely
and totally destroyed!

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.900
Wait, does that mean
that Gong could win this?

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.433
No, it means
Gong will win!

00:20:13.433 --> 00:20:15.000
Now we dance!
Woo!

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.300
Go&amp;

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.800
Swinging Sword Slash!

00:20:37.266 --> 00:20:38.666
(announcer)
And there you have it!

00:20:38.666 --> 00:20:42.666
Our winner by way of a walloping
whack of the sword‐‐ Gong!

00:20:46.233 --> 00:20:47.766
I knew he'd win
all along.

00:20:47.766 --> 00:20:49.966
After all, he learned
from the best!

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.033
Gong's sorry that he worried
so much about you...

00:20:56.033 --> 00:20:57.500
Friendo.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.900
Hey, now we know we can both
stand strong and face any storm.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.766
Yuya!

00:21:04.766 --> 00:21:07.466
(Frederick) Why was it you were
so delayed in getting to here?

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:09.900
I ran into a couple of
Grizzlepike's pals.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.600
They tried to steal
the spotlight,

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.066
but I showed them!

00:21:13.066 --> 00:21:15.800
Well, duel fans,
this match may be over,

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.866
but that just means another
battle can now begin!

00:21:18.866 --> 00:21:23.366
Yuya Sakaki and Sylvio Sawatari,
report to the center duel court.

00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:27.233
You two duelists are set
to tangle next!

00:21:27.233 --> 00:21:29.033
Time to shine!

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.600
