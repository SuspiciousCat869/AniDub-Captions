WEBVTT

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.100
Previously on
"YuGiOh Arc‐V..."

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.166
It's Yuya Sakaki versus
Sylvio Sawatari

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.300
in a duel
destined to dazzle!

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.066
For all of the defeats
and disrespect,

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.466
now I will finally
settle the score.

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.533
Let's duel!

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.766
Since my Yosenju
dealt you damage,

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:21.766
Kama 3's special ability
lets me draw another Yosenju!

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.766
And the one I'm adding
may surprise you.

00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.666
It's a Pendulum Monster!

00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.933
Yosenju Shinchu L!

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.900
A Pendulum Monster?
But how?

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.533
Yosenju Shinchu R is
the perfect addition

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:39.700
to help me subtract you
from this duel.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.433
Another
Pendulum Monster.

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:43.033
That's two!
Behold!

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:45.966
I give you
Mayosenju Daibak!

00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.933
(Nico Smiley)
Simply sensational!

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:51.100
Sylvio has performed
a perfect Pendulum Summon!

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.366
Mr. President,
the summoning was
a success.

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.866
First, three cards
return to your hand.

00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.400
And after that,
they return to your deck,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.200
where you'll have a hard time
drawing them again.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.466
Guess without
your Pendulum cards,

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:07.433
you're not the duel‐tainer
that you thought you were.

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:09.166
True,
those cards are gone.

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.866
But there are other cards
still out there.

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.133

Welcome back,
duel fans!

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.100
And now let me
get you back up to speed!

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.233
Sylvio Sawatari has
shocked us all

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:31.766
by so far beating
Yuya at his own game

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:34.866
and Pendulum Summoning his way
into the spotlight!

00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:37.800
Plus, he's used a powerful pair
of Pendulum cards

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.866
to seal
Yuya's own Pendulums

00:02:39.866 --> 00:02:41.133
deep down in his deck!

00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:43.366
Yuya has zero cards
in his hand.

00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:46.133
Does he have zero chance
at running away with this duel?

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.700
If Yuya gets beat
in this match...

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.033
He's washed up!
For sure.

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:54.233
Sylvio will be
the new next big thing!

00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:56.266
Yuya, you can do this!

00:02:56.266 --> 00:02:58.900
That's right! Show this crowd
what you're made of!

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.400
Just remember...

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.466
(both)
You're a star!

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.133
Oh, Yuya.
I know why you're running.

00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:08.366
You're looking for
an Action Card.

00:03:08.366 --> 00:03:10.166
But before you find it,

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:13.133
my monsters
will find you!

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.066
I summon Yosenju Kama 1!

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:22.766
And then I'll bring out
his brother, Yosenju Kama 2!

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:29.600
But this brotherhood's not
complete without Yosenju Kama 3!

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.300
And then
the power of my spell

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.200
Yosen Training Grounds
comes into play!

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.600
Which means, since these three
samurai spirits were summoned,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.766
three candles light up!

00:03:41.766 --> 00:03:44.500
And it means that while
you've been running around,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.733
I've set myself up
to win this!

00:03:46.733 --> 00:03:49.400
And there's no running
from that, Yuya!

00:04:01.933 --> 00:04:04.800
Come on...
Come on...

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.600
(thinking)
You think your
running around is

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.500
going to distract me
from remembering

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.566
you have two other
cards on your field?

00:04:13.566 --> 00:04:15.266
Well, think again,

00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:17.266
because I've got them
in my sights,

00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:18.666
and I'm gonna
take care of them

00:04:18.666 --> 00:04:21.166
before you can
use them!

00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:25.066
I activate Yosenju Shinchu R's
Pendulum ability!

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:27.066
Since there's
another Yosenju monster

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:28.766
in the opposite
Pendulum Zone,

00:04:28.766 --> 00:04:32.300
the Pendulum Scale
rises to 11!

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.833
Now I can summon monsters
from Levels 4 through 10,

00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:36.300
simultaneously!

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.600
(shouts, cheers)

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.500
Monster emerge!

00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:48.033
So rise once again,
Mayosenju Daibak!

00:04:52.566 --> 00:04:54.800
(roaring)

00:04:56.266 --> 00:04:58.200
And with
Daibak's return,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.966
another candle is lit!

00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:05.033
Yuya... You gotta
do something quick!

00:05:05.033 --> 00:05:08.766
As you may recall, Daibak has
a very special ability.

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:11.433
Daiback, blast Yuya's
two facedowns back to his hand.

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:16.933
And now...
my Dizzying Winds trap

00:05:16.933 --> 00:05:18.733
sends those cards
back to your deck.

00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:20.166
You've got
no cards on your field,

00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:21.533
no cards in your hand,

00:05:21.533 --> 00:05:23.933
and no chances
of winning this duel!

00:05:23.933 --> 00:05:26.100
You might as well just
keep on running, Yuya.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.800
All the way home!
Because you're finished!

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.033
Actually, I'm just
getting started!

00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:39.066
'Cause of this!

00:05:39.066 --> 00:05:41.933
By doing me the favor
of returning Amnesia to my deck,

00:05:41.933 --> 00:05:43.933
it now activates,
so thanks!

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.466
No way!

00:05:47.466 --> 00:05:50.666
Your monsters now have
a slight case of Amnesia

00:05:50.666 --> 00:05:52.600
and don't know
they're Yosenjus anymore.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.933
Oh, no.

00:05:53.933 --> 00:05:56.433
If they don't know
they're Yosenjus...

00:05:56.433 --> 00:05:59.133
Then they're not welcome in
their village home anymore.

00:05:59.133 --> 00:06:01.633
So if your Yosenjus
return to your hand,

00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:03.400
Dizzying Winds will
send them flying back

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.100
into your deck
instead!

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.600
(growling)

00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:10.866
Clever move.

00:06:10.866 --> 00:06:12.300
Thanks!
Guess this duel's

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.533
gonna last longer
than you thought, huh?

00:06:14.533 --> 00:06:16.900
Nope! 'Cause
Dizzying Wind's effect

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.566
doesn't activate until
the turn's over!

00:06:19.566 --> 00:06:21.766
So that means
all I have to do

00:06:21.766 --> 00:06:23.000
is beat you before then!

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.466
Which I will!

00:06:32.466 --> 00:06:35.400
Daibak!
Attack Yuya directly!

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.066
Everyone else,
follow its lead!

00:06:38.066 --> 00:06:39.300
(Smiley)
Oh, my!

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.866
Sylvio's
heading for Yuya

00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:42.300
with all his monsters!

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.466
I don't
wanna look!

00:06:47.066 --> 00:06:49.433
Perfect.

00:06:49.433 --> 00:06:51.033
This is it, Yuya!

00:06:51.033 --> 00:06:52.433
(roaring)

00:06:56.733 --> 00:06:57.833
(both)
Yuya, no!

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.066
Yuya!

00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:16.500
Oh, no!

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.833
Can't be...

00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:19.500
Yuya.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.033
(chuckling)

00:07:23.033 --> 00:07:25.466
Showtime is
officially over!

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.466
(snap)

00:07:30.933 --> 00:07:34.133
Actually,
I'd say showtime's
going into overtime!

00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:35.733
Look!
It's Yuya!

00:07:35.733 --> 00:07:37.800
Sure is!
He's okay!

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.133
(laughing)

00:07:40.133 --> 00:07:42.066
He's back!
(all)
Yeah, Yuya!

00:07:42.066 --> 00:07:44.900
No way! How'd you survive
that onslaught?

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.533
(laughing)

00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:47.933
I'll tell you how.

00:07:47.933 --> 00:07:51.033
By using the Action Card
I found a couple minutes ago.

00:07:51.033 --> 00:07:52.266
A couple minutes ago?

00:07:52.266 --> 00:07:54.166
So Yuya knew about it
this whole time?

00:07:54.166 --> 00:07:55.533
Of course.

00:07:55.533 --> 00:07:57.266
He found it earlier

00:07:57.266 --> 00:07:59.700
but didn't say anything
so Sylvio would attack.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.533
Then Yuya could grab it
at the last second

00:08:01.533 --> 00:08:02.533
and spring it on him!

00:08:04.633 --> 00:08:07.166
I give you the Action Spell
Big Escape!

00:08:07.166 --> 00:08:09.433
It got me out
without a scrape!

00:08:09.433 --> 00:08:11.000
(whimpering)

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.600
All right! That move
was duel‐tacular!

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.033
Take a bow!

00:08:15.033 --> 00:08:17.333
(cheering)

00:08:19.233 --> 00:08:21.600
Cut that out!

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.400
I'm the star duelist
around here, not you!

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.866
If you're a star,
then it's the falling kind!

00:08:27.866 --> 00:08:29.333
We'll just see, Yuya.

00:08:29.333 --> 00:08:31.000
There's a lot more
dueling left.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.200
I activate Yosen
Training Grounds's effect!

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.000
By putting out
three candles,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.500
I can add one Yosenju
in my deck to my hand!

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.766
I add Yosenju Kama 3,
then end my turn.

00:08:43.766 --> 00:08:46.233
And that means
all your monsters

00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:47.833
now go bye‐bye!

00:08:47.833 --> 00:08:48.700
(growling)

00:08:54.766 --> 00:08:57.566
And now Yosen Whirlwind
is gone, too,

00:08:57.566 --> 00:08:59.000
'cause, without
Yosenju monsters,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.066
I'm not allowed to keep it
around.

00:09:02.066 --> 00:09:05.533
Next, Yosenju Shinchu R's
Scale drops back down to 5.

00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:07.633
And don't you dare forget,
duel fans!

00:09:07.633 --> 00:09:09.266
Due to
Dizzying Wind's effect,

00:09:09.266 --> 00:09:12.666
Sylvio's monsters go
to his deck, not his hand!

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.600
Time for you
to get a taste

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.066
of your own
medicine!

00:09:17.066 --> 00:09:19.300
(chuckling)
Oh, Yuya, in the end,

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.166
that move is going
to be bittersweet.

00:09:21.166 --> 00:09:22.733
'Cause it's going
to end up leaving

00:09:22.733 --> 00:09:24.433
a bad taste
in your mouth!

00:09:24.433 --> 00:09:26.433
Oh, I don't know
about that.

00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:28.266
Winning tastes great!

00:09:28.266 --> 00:09:30.533
Time for me to shine
in the spotlight!

00:09:30.533 --> 00:09:32.900
I draw‐‐ Yes!

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.666
Since neither of us has
any monsters on the field,

00:09:35.666 --> 00:09:39.400
by lowering this guy's
level by one, I play...

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.900
Performapal
Drummerilla!

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.766
Here we go!

00:09:46.766 --> 00:09:49.400
Drummerilla,
attack Sylvio directly!

00:09:52.466 --> 00:09:54.133
Bring it, Yuya,

00:09:54.133 --> 00:09:56.400
but you're barking up
the wrong tree!

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.300
By discarding
one Yosenju,

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.366
I can summon Yosenju Oyam

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:02.066
to intercept
your attack!

00:10:04.166 --> 00:10:06.933
Which means not only
do I get to light a candle,

00:10:06.933 --> 00:10:09.400
but your dumb drum is
gonna get pounded

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.466
'cause Yosenju Oyam
gets the same number

00:10:11.466 --> 00:10:13.500
of attack points as him!

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.700
No problem. Drummerilla's
special ability activates!

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.800
It gives him
600 extra attack points

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.866
to give your monster
a percussion concussion!

00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:34.133
(Nico Smiley)
Oh, my!

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:36.500
Drummerilla just pounded
Sylvio's life points

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.900
like they were
a pair of rented bongos!

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.900
Now, since
the battle is over,

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.400
Drummerilla's points
go back to normal.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.233
All right!
Yuya sure is on a roll now!

00:10:48.233 --> 00:10:50.166
Yeah. I bet
he's gonna find a way

00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:51.333
to Pendulum Summon

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:53.200
and really put
the pressure on!

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.633
And now
I'll end my turn!

00:10:55.633 --> 00:10:57.800
Huh? So much
for the roll!

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.266
What a letdown.

00:10:59.266 --> 00:11:01.500
I was hoping
he'd Pendulum Summon!

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.133
Now, now,
don't worry!

00:11:04.133 --> 00:11:06.433
Yuya may have
let you down,

00:11:06.433 --> 00:11:08.933
But I promise you
that I won't!

00:11:08.933 --> 00:11:11.000
I draw!

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.400
First, I'll extinguish
three candles.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.000
And once again bring Daibak
from my deck to my hand!

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.833
If this crowd wants
excitement,

00:11:20.833 --> 00:11:22.766
some may well
be on its way!

00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:25.033
Get ready!
He's gonna do it!

00:11:25.033 --> 00:11:27.333
He's gonna
Pendulum Summon!

00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:30.166
(crowd)
Pendulum! Pendulum!

00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:31.333
Pendulum!

00:11:31.333 --> 00:11:34.233
Yeah, that's right!
Let's hear it!

00:11:34.233 --> 00:11:35.800
Never mind Yuya.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.433
The true star... is me!

00:11:39.433 --> 00:11:41.466
And right now
my Pendulum Scale's range

00:11:41.466 --> 00:11:43.800
is 3 to 5!

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.833
Which means that
I'm allowed to summon

00:11:45.833 --> 00:11:47.566
Level 4 monsters!

00:11:47.566 --> 00:11:50.700
So Sylvio's not gonna raise
the scale like before?

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.166
Then that means
he can't summon Daibak!

00:11:53.166 --> 00:11:55.466
I Pendulum Summon!

00:11:56.933 --> 00:11:59.400
Welcome back
Yosenju Kama 1!

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.900
And Kama 3!

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.566
And these two
samurai brothers

00:12:03.566 --> 00:12:05.333
are really gonna light
a fire under you!

00:12:07.466 --> 00:12:10.366
Next, I activate
Kama 1's special ability!

00:12:10.366 --> 00:12:12.033
To take out
Drummerilla!

00:12:12.033 --> 00:12:14.533
I gotta find another...

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:15.733
Action Card!

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.100
You can run, but running
won't save your Drummerilla!

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.466
It's about to go
Ape‐stinct!

00:12:26.466 --> 00:12:29.433
I activate
the Action Spell
Invisibility,

00:12:29.433 --> 00:12:32.266
so your attack misses cause
Drummerrilla's invisible!

00:12:32.266 --> 00:12:34.066
That's bananas!

00:12:34.066 --> 00:12:36.566
One more gorilla gag,
and I'm losing it!

00:12:36.566 --> 00:12:38.133
It's monkey business!

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:40.266
(Smiley)
Wow! Once again,
Yuya took action

00:12:40.266 --> 00:12:42.166
with an Action Card
to save himself!

00:12:42.166 --> 00:12:44.900
Fine!
I'll just go with
plan B!

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.333
"B" as in
"bad for you"!

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.433
I'm tributing
my two samurai spirits

00:12:49.433 --> 00:12:50.933
to summon Daibak!

00:12:53.933 --> 00:12:56.900
(roaring)

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.800
Now another candle
lights up!

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.433
And that means
your chances of winning

00:13:00.433 --> 00:13:02.600
are going up
in flames!

00:13:05.533 --> 00:13:07.766
(Smiley)
Uh‐oh! What will
Yuya do now?

00:13:07.766 --> 00:13:10.100
There's not much
that Yuya can do!

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.733
So then,
why is he smiling?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.433
Wipe off that grin!

00:13:15.433 --> 00:13:17.800
Don't you see
you're about to lose?

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.033
Sorry, Sylvio,
it's just...

00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:22.533
The crowd's
so pumped up!

00:13:22.533 --> 00:13:23.833
So what?

00:13:23.833 --> 00:13:26.466
So that's what
this is all about!

00:13:26.466 --> 00:13:28.000
Giving them
a good show!

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.333
Entertaining them with
everything we've got!

00:13:30.333 --> 00:13:32.200
It's what matters most.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.033
And I know I'll do all I can
to wow this crowd.

00:13:35.033 --> 00:13:37.166
That's the reason
that I'm smiling.

00:13:37.166 --> 00:13:40.400
Well, that smile won't be
sticking around for long!

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.266
You'll soon realize that
it's gonna be curtains for you

00:13:43.266 --> 00:13:45.100
and that
I'm the better duelist!

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.633
Not quite.

00:13:47.633 --> 00:13:50.300
You might think
you're the better duelist,

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.566
but I know that I'm the best!

00:13:52.566 --> 00:13:55.333
Doubt it, 'cause
you're going down right now!

00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:57.133
Daibak, go!

00:13:57.133 --> 00:13:58.500
Attack Drummerilla!

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.833
(roaring)

00:14:00.833 --> 00:14:02.233
Not happening!

00:14:02.233 --> 00:14:04.766
Drummerilla's
special ability activates,

00:14:04.766 --> 00:14:07.200
so he gains
600 attack points!

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.966
It won't save him,
but it will save me

00:14:08.966 --> 00:14:10.433
some life points!

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.800
Sorry, Drummerilla,
but for now,

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.766
hang out
in my Extra Deck.

00:14:18.766 --> 00:14:22.033
Oh, my! Yuya's barely
hanging on to his life points,

00:14:22.033 --> 00:14:24.233
and this crowd is barely
keeping it together!

00:14:24.233 --> 00:14:26.900
Oh, man! It doesn't get
any better than this!

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.100
Oh, boy!
This is too good!

00:14:30.966 --> 00:14:33.300
You know, I think
these two are really

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.900
raising
each other's games.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.833
Yeah! Now it's just
who wants it more!

00:14:37.833 --> 00:14:39.733
I end my turn!

00:14:39.733 --> 00:14:42.166
But this time,
my Daibak gets to stick around

00:14:42.166 --> 00:14:43.766
and hound you
some more!

00:14:43.766 --> 00:14:45.633
I have to admit,
I've never seen

00:14:45.633 --> 00:14:47.600
Sylvio duel
so well before.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.233
He's playing with
a sound strategy,

00:14:49.233 --> 00:14:51.833
clever card combos,
and top notch tactics.

00:14:51.833 --> 00:14:54.200
Mm‐hmm.
If he can keep it up,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.933
he'll win this duel
for sure.

00:14:55.933 --> 00:14:58.033
So does that mean
his head'll get even bigger?

00:14:59.933 --> 00:15:02.833
(all)
Let's not think about it.

00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:05.966
Yuya, you can't let
Sylvio have all the fun!

00:15:05.966 --> 00:15:07.933
Let's see you
Pendulum Summon!

00:15:07.933 --> 00:15:10.200
It might be close
to impossible,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.633
but if anyone can
swing it, you can!

00:15:13.633 --> 00:15:16.333
Pendulum! Pendulum!

00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:18.500
Pendulum! Pendulum!

00:15:20.766 --> 00:15:22.766
Okay, it's your time
to shine.

00:15:22.766 --> 00:15:24.066
Huh?

00:15:24.066 --> 00:15:25.366
Go ahead, Yuya.

00:15:25.366 --> 00:15:27.733
If you really are
the star you say you are,

00:15:27.733 --> 00:15:29.033
prove it now.

00:15:29.033 --> 00:15:30.433
Everyone's watching.

00:15:31.766 --> 00:15:33.766
They are.

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:35.400
Aw, what's wrong?

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.166
Feeling
stage fright now?

00:15:38.433 --> 00:15:39.900
No chance!

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.700
Ladies, gentlemen,

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.600
duelists of all ages,
as you can see,

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.800
there are no cards left
on my field,

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.933
and I have no cards
in my hand either.

00:15:49.933 --> 00:15:53.266
That means that everything is
riding on this very next draw,

00:15:53.266 --> 00:15:55.533
and if that's
not dueltainment,

00:15:55.533 --> 00:15:57.900
well then,
I guess I don't know what is!

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.500
Draw!

00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:08.100
All right!

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.533
Time to give
this crowd

00:16:09.533 --> 00:16:11.666
a finale that they'll
never ever forget!

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.200
Check it out!

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.000
I'm allowed to
activate this card

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.700
when it's
the only card I have!

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.200
Here goes!

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.733
It's a spell called
Magician Manipulation!

00:16:21.733 --> 00:16:25.000
I get to draw a card for
every card on your field.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.366
You have five on
the field, Sylvio.

00:16:27.366 --> 00:16:28.966
So that means
I draw five!

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:35.533
All right,
let's see!

00:16:35.533 --> 00:16:37.633
I drew Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon,

00:16:37.633 --> 00:16:38.933
Turn Toad,

00:16:38.933 --> 00:16:40.433
Timegazer Magician,

00:16:40.433 --> 00:16:41.466
Trump Witch,

00:16:41.466 --> 00:16:44.233
and Skeeter Skimmer!

00:16:44.233 --> 00:16:46.033
(cheering)

00:16:46.033 --> 00:16:48.266
He did it,
he found a way!

00:16:48.266 --> 00:16:50.700
(all)
Yuya! Go for it!

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.233
I'll use Scale 4
Trump Witch

00:16:52.233 --> 00:16:53.933
and Scale 8
Timegazer Magician

00:16:53.933 --> 00:16:55.966
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:16:55.966 --> 00:16:58.700
I'm taking control
of this duel starting now!

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.700
(Smiley)
Oh, dear!

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.566
Talk about
a major swing in momentum!

00:17:07.566 --> 00:17:09.266
And a Pendulum swing
to boot!

00:17:09.266 --> 00:17:11.533
This star's
about to shine!

00:17:11.533 --> 00:17:12.900
I'm allowed to summon
monsters

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.866
from Level 5 through 7,
all at the same time!

00:17:15.866 --> 00:17:18.233
Back and forth,
to and fro!

00:17:18.233 --> 00:17:21.833
What's coming next,
you'll all soon know!

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:26.166
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:17:28.533 --> 00:17:31.733
Drum to it,
Performapal Drummerilla!

00:17:31.733 --> 00:17:34.500
Turn up the heat, Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:17:37.133 --> 00:17:39.766
(roaring)

00:17:39.766 --> 00:17:42.900
(Smiley)
Absolutely amazing!
Both duelists now have

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.000
their most menacing
monsters out!

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.900
Attack, Yuya,
I dare you!

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.500
Sure! Odd‐Eyes,
get set to strike!

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.533
Attack Daibak!

00:17:52.533 --> 00:17:55.166
Fool!
My monster is stronger!

00:17:55.166 --> 00:17:57.300
Not for long,
Sylvio!

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.933
I activate
Drummerilla's ability!

00:17:59.933 --> 00:18:02.433
Odd‐Eyes gains
600 attack points
for this battle!

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.000
Daibak has been
destroyed,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.200
and thanks to Odd‐Eyes'
special ability,

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.800
you take double
the damage!

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.833
I don't think so,
Yuya!

00:18:13.833 --> 00:18:15.866
Daibak's not
going anywhere,

00:18:15.866 --> 00:18:18.233
thanks to Yosenju Shinchu L's
special ability!

00:18:20.533 --> 00:18:22.266
(Smiley)
That pillar prevented Daiback

00:18:22.266 --> 00:18:24.600
from being permanently
posterized!

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.833
That was a smart play
by Sylvio.

00:18:26.833 --> 00:18:28.933
Both these guys are
playing out of their minds!

00:18:28.933 --> 00:18:31.100
This is so good
I can't watch!

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.400
Great duel!
Wish you both
could win today.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.366
But both of us can't!
True!

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:39.000
So maybe it's time
we settle who's number one!

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.933
I activate Performapal Trump
Witch's Pendulum ability,

00:18:42.933 --> 00:18:45.433
and, boy, is it gonna
swing the duel my way

00:18:45.433 --> 00:18:47.066
'cause Trump Witch's
ability lets me

00:18:47.066 --> 00:18:48.600
fuse my monsters
together!

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.966
Say wha...?

00:18:49.966 --> 00:18:52.800
Fusion Summon?
During battle?

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.966
I don't like
the sound of this!

00:18:57.266 --> 00:18:59.533
Now by fusing
the raw strength
of one monster

00:18:59.533 --> 00:19:01.600
with the ferocity
of another...

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.033
I'm... Then...

00:19:03.033 --> 00:19:05.466
Going...
To...

00:19:05.466 --> 00:19:07.766
Fusion Summon!

00:19:07.766 --> 00:19:09.966
Look to the skies
and feast your eyes

00:19:09.966 --> 00:19:12.433
on Beast‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:19:13.866 --> 00:19:16.133
(roaring)

00:19:16.133 --> 00:19:17.900
This is unheard of.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.566
He Fusion Summoned
using Pendulum Monsters!

00:19:20.566 --> 00:19:24.133
Yes, he's figuring out how
to maximize his Pendulum powers.

00:19:24.133 --> 00:19:26.066
But can he win?

00:19:26.066 --> 00:19:28.066
(Smiley)
Only one will walk away
the victor.

00:19:28.066 --> 00:19:29.766
Who will it be?

00:19:33.066 --> 00:19:34.966
(Smiley)
What a high‐stakes
stand off!

00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:38.400
Both monsters have
3,000 attack points!

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.333
Let's go! Beast‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon attack Daibak!

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.066
(Smiley)
Now both duelists are
diving for Action Cards!

00:19:53.566 --> 00:19:55.400
(roaring)

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.633
Whoa, both monsters
got blasted!

00:20:04.633 --> 00:20:08.400
I play the Action Spell
Burning Barrel!

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.500
Since I destroyed your
Beast‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon,

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.300
you take damage equal to
half its attack points,

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.900
and that means
you lose!

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.233
Look out!

00:20:23.666 --> 00:20:25.600
What in the world?

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.466
Yuya somehow swapped
his damage for fireworks!

00:20:28.466 --> 00:20:30.266
So pretty!

00:20:30.266 --> 00:20:31.933
What a show!

00:20:31.933 --> 00:20:33.800
You may have gotten
an Action Card,

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.133
but I got one too!

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:36.733
Miracle protected
my monster!

00:20:36.733 --> 00:20:39.500
So Beast‐Eyes is safe,
but yours is history!

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.466
No way...
This can't be!

00:20:42.466 --> 00:20:43.733
And there's more.

00:20:43.733 --> 00:20:46.433
Now Beast‐Eyes' special
ability activates!

00:20:46.433 --> 00:20:49.200
Since I used Drummerilla
to Fusion Summon Beast‐Eyes,

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.633
and since Beast‐Eyes
destroyed your monster,

00:20:51.633 --> 00:20:52.933
you take damage equal

00:20:52.933 --> 00:20:54.500
to Drummerilla's
attack points.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.400
So that's 1,600 points
of damage coming your way!

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.300
Aah!

00:21:04.066 --> 00:21:05.366
(Smiley)
And there you have it!

00:21:05.366 --> 00:21:07.966
Our winner by way
of a well‐timed drumming.

00:21:07.966 --> 00:21:09.833
Yuya Sakaki!

00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:12.233
(all)
Yeah, Yuya!

00:21:12.233 --> 00:21:13.766
(groaning)

00:21:21.833 --> 00:21:23.433
You okay?

00:21:23.433 --> 00:21:26.400
(applause)

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.766
Yeah!
Way to go!

00:21:28.766 --> 00:21:31.533
What a duel!

00:21:31.533 --> 00:21:33.633
Awesome!
We're a big hit!

00:21:35.833 --> 00:21:38.066
Thanks!

00:21:38.066 --> 00:21:40.733
Our score is settled,
'til next time.

00:21:42.266 --> 00:21:45.066
Sounds good! Thanks
for the great match!

00:21:45.066 --> 00:21:47.866
(thinking)
After all, it brought out
the very best in me,

00:21:47.866 --> 00:21:50.933
and if I'm going to ever get
to my Dad's level of dueling,

00:21:50.933 --> 00:21:53.433
my best is exactly
what it's gonna take!

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.200
Retrieve those
Pendulum Cards

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.266
and bring them back here
for analysis.

00:22:00.266 --> 00:22:02.133
Sylvio's out
of the tournament.

00:22:02.133 --> 00:22:04.800
It's not like
he needs them anymore.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.400
Understood.

00:23:06.633 --> 00:23:09.433
