(man)
Please unbuckle
your seatbelts

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.233
and fold down
your tray tables.

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:17.833
We'll be landing
shortly‐‐

(man 2)
Congratulations on
the successful negotiations,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.700
Madame Chairwoman.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.100
Thank you, Claude.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.833
It seems that everything is
going according to plan so far.

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:40.766
And what a plan it is,

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.733
to grow the Leo Institute
to new heights.

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.366
Oh, it will be grand.

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.333
Very soon with the help
of the Leo Institute

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.700
dueling will touch
every part of the globe..

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.500
It will become
an entire way of life.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
Yes, your hard work is starting
to show and the President

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.966
is pleased with
the results,

00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.333
but...

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.366
But what?

00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.300
While you were gone,
Madame Chairwoman,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.866
there were some,
shall we say,

00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.966
intriguing developments here.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.233
Developments that all seem to
stem from something called

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:11.300
Pendulum Summoning.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.333

(Declan)
Welcome back, Mother.

00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:21.233
Ah, Declan...

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:23.333
Have you heard of a new
summoning method?

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:24.566
From what I hear

00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:27.866
it's unlike Fusion,
Synchro or Xyz summoning.

00:02:27.866 --> 00:02:29.666
From what I hear,
it's unlike anything

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:32.833
that the world has
ever seen before.

00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:34.100
Yes, Mother...

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.300
It's true.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.033
I think you'd
better sit down...

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.500
These bits of footage we've
compiled tell the whole story.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:50.433
I'll use Stargazer Magician
and Timegazer Magician

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:52.066
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:55.033
I'm taking control
of this duel starting now!

00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:05.266
I'm allowed to summon monsters
from Level 2 through 7

00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:07.100
all at the same time!

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.933
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:11.100
Carve the arc of victory!

00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:16.500
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:28.266
(man)
Sir, I picked up an
unusual summoning signal

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:29.333
from the city's
coastal zone.

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:30.933
The reading is off the charts!

00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:32.233
(man 2)
Analysis, quick!

00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:34.000
I have the results, sir.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.800
If the wave patterns are
correct, then someone

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.866
is using pendulum energy!

00:03:37.866 --> 00:03:40.133
How can this be?

00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:41.933
By way of a new type of card

00:03:41.933 --> 00:03:44.200
known quite aptly
as a Pendulum card.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.500
As you saw, by utilizing two of
them, you can summon numerous

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.100
high‐level monsters...

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.600
It's a powerful technique.

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:54.100
These cards...

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.966
Where'd they come from?

00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:59.766
We have our best people looking
into that as we speak.

00:03:59.766 --> 00:04:03.766
So far, they haven't
been able to find anything.

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:06.300
But I found a lead that
is quite promising,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.633
and I think you will feel
the same way, dear Mother.

00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:11.066
I'm intrigued.

00:04:11.066 --> 00:04:13.200
Please, go on.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.766
It's in regard to the duelist
who first used these cards.

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:19.066
His name is Yuya Sakaki.

00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:21.733
He's a 14 year‐old who attends
a cut rate duel school

00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:23.500
known as You Show.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.233
He's in the Junior Arc League

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:27.933
and his duel record
is 46 matches

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:30.700
with 26 wins
and 20 losses.

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:36.033
So he's an average
duelist at best.

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:37.633
Surely, Declan...

00:04:37.633 --> 00:04:40.033
You're not suggesting that
someone like this could be

00:04:40.033 --> 00:04:43.466
responsible for pioneering such
a cutting edge duel technique.

00:04:43.466 --> 00:04:46.500
Did I mention he's
Yusho Sakaki's son?

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.866
Yusho Sakaki?

00:04:51.266 --> 00:04:54.133
The same Yusho Sakaki that
vanished years ago?

00:04:54.133 --> 00:04:57.733
Are you saying he's back,
and back to cause us trouble?

00:04:57.733 --> 00:05:00.466
I don't know
but we must find out.

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.633
And I may have a way...

00:05:02.633 --> 00:05:04.966
Yes?

00:05:04.966 --> 00:05:06.300
Just the other day,

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.766
I received reports of an
incident not far off campus.

00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:13.300
Uh‐huh.
A duelist was sent
to the hospital after a duel.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.333
He says the one responsible
was Yuya Sakaki.

00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:23.833
(Sylvio)
Yuya Sakaki's going to pay!

00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:25.933
He's the one
who did this to me!

00:05:25.933 --> 00:05:27.766
He tried to hide behind
that mask...

00:05:27.766 --> 00:05:28.700
But I know!

00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:32.907
(man)
I Xyz Summon
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:41.873
(Sylvio)
I'm so mad it hurts!

00:05:41.873 --> 00:05:44.473
Yeah, 'cause you're hitting
yourself with your cast.

00:05:44.473 --> 00:05:45.673
Hard, too.

00:05:45.673 --> 00:05:47.440
Quiet!
Now...

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.873
You three were there, too,
and you saw him...

00:05:49.873 --> 00:05:51.040
Right?

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.873
Of course, yeah!

00:05:53.873 --> 00:05:54.940
Yeah, for sure!

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.373
It's true!

00:05:56.373 --> 00:05:58.673
We totally agree
with you, bro!

00:05:58.673 --> 00:06:00.373
So totally agree!

00:06:00.373 --> 00:06:03.740
That means you won't thump us
with your cast, right?

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.640
(man)
The only one
getting thumped...

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.840
Will be Yuya,

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.207
because when you mess
with Sylvio,

00:06:11.207 --> 00:06:12.707
you mess with me!

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:17.340
And if you've forgotten, I'm
Sylvio's father and mayoral

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.973
<i>candidate Furio Sawatari</i>

00:06:18.973 --> 00:06:21.707
and these tears I shed
for my son are sincere!

00:06:21.707 --> 00:06:24.440
After all, I'm a family man,
a man of the people!

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.707
Wow...

00:06:25.707 --> 00:06:28.007
He'll do anything
for a vote, won't he?

00:06:28.007 --> 00:06:29.473
Yeah...

00:06:29.473 --> 00:06:31.107
You know, aside
from actual work.

00:06:31.107 --> 00:06:32.140
Dad!

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.073
Hey, lose that smile!

00:06:34.073 --> 00:06:37.040
If I'm gonna get the sympathy
vote you need to look infirmed,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.107
okay?

00:06:38.107 --> 00:06:39.873
Sorry, Pop.
Will do!

00:06:39.873 --> 00:06:42.140
(Madame Chairwoman)
Oh, there's our poor
little patient,

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.140
however are
you coping, Sylvio?

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.540
(Furio)
Madame Chairwoman,
when did you get back?

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.173
Just this morning, councilman,

00:06:50.173 --> 00:06:53.573
and seeing Sylvio was
first on my to‐do list.

00:06:53.573 --> 00:06:56.540
Well, you grace
us with your presence!

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.440
So kind of you.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.973
Such a thing that happened‐‐
this delinquent doing harm

00:07:00.973 --> 00:07:02.307
to your sweet boy...

00:07:02.307 --> 00:07:05.473
And I'm certain that you're
steaming mad and prepared to do

00:07:05.473 --> 00:07:08.373
whatever it takes to see
that justice is served?

00:07:08.373 --> 00:07:10.640
How's this for steaming?

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.273
In fact, I'm calling for
Yuya's arrest right now!

00:07:13.273 --> 00:07:14.673
Actually...

00:07:14.673 --> 00:07:18.507
What if you let me handle
this little matter for you?

00:07:18.507 --> 00:07:20.940
After all, you want
to be mayor, correct?

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.207
And a mayor delegates, right?

00:07:23.207 --> 00:07:24.840
Huh.
I guess...

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.973
This way you'll
project power.

00:07:26.973 --> 00:07:28.407
You think so?

00:07:28.407 --> 00:07:30.073
Sure.

00:07:30.073 --> 00:07:31.840
The voters will love it.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.640
So why don't you
just relax

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.073
and leave everything to me.

00:07:36.073 --> 00:07:37.607
(Skip)
Good morning class,

00:07:37.607 --> 00:07:39.673
today we'll be
learning all about how to

00:07:39.673 --> 00:07:41.407
summon in a duel.

00:07:41.407 --> 00:07:43.173
First up, the Normal Summon.

00:07:43.173 --> 00:07:46.073
This is the most basic summoning
method where you take a monster

00:07:46.073 --> 00:07:48.207
from your hand
then place it face‐up

00:07:48.207 --> 00:07:49.373
in attack mode
on the field.

00:07:49.373 --> 00:07:52.107
Now who can explain
a Tribute Summoning?

00:07:52.107 --> 00:07:53.740
Anyone?
You, Tate.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.873
Tell us.

00:07:54.873 --> 00:07:56.173
Sure!

00:07:56.173 --> 00:07:59.107
A Tribute Summoning is similar
to a Normal Summoning...

00:07:59.107 --> 00:08:01.773
However, there is
one key difference:

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:04.473
when calling out a Level 5
or 6 monster,

00:08:04.473 --> 00:08:06.840
one must tribute
a monster on your field.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.707
If it's Level 7‐or‐above,

00:08:08.707 --> 00:08:11.807
then one must
tribute two monsters.

00:08:11.807 --> 00:08:13.373
That's right!

00:08:13.373 --> 00:08:14.440
Bravo...

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.407
Someone's been studying.

00:08:18.207 --> 00:08:20.373
This lesson is boring.

00:08:20.373 --> 00:08:22.240
Seriously, what time
is lunch?

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.607
Right now!

00:08:23.607 --> 00:08:26.307
Because I'm Fusion Summoning
my mashed potatoes...

00:08:26.307 --> 00:08:27.607
With yogurt...

00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:28.807
To create...

00:08:28.807 --> 00:08:32.507
The new food craze...
mashed pogurt!

00:08:32.507 --> 00:08:34.273
So sour and starchy.

00:08:34.273 --> 00:08:36.507
Hey, you're being rude...

00:08:36.507 --> 00:08:37.607
Oh, sorry.

00:08:37.607 --> 00:08:39.007
Yeah, you're right.

00:08:39.007 --> 00:08:40.507
I should be sharing!

00:08:40.507 --> 00:08:42.240
No, what I mean...

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.673
Is that you shouldn't be eating
in class like that.

00:08:44.673 --> 00:08:47.240
Am I right, Zuzu?

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.707
Uh, earth to Zuzu...

00:08:49.707 --> 00:08:52.207
Uh... Hello?

00:08:52.207 --> 00:08:53.907
You there?

00:08:53.907 --> 00:08:55.273
I just don't understand...

00:08:55.273 --> 00:08:57.240
She's been spacey
since yesterday.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.840
So strange...

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.273
Was that Yuya?

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:01.873
I just... don't know...

00:09:01.873 --> 00:09:04.273
Hm, hope she's okay.

00:09:04.273 --> 00:09:05.607
I'm worried.

00:09:05.607 --> 00:09:08.973
All right, next we'll be going
over Fusion Summoning,

00:09:08.973 --> 00:09:11.107
so which of you would
like to volunteer?

00:09:11.107 --> 00:09:12.473
Next I Fusion Summon,

00:09:12.473 --> 00:09:15.173
this donut
and Principal Boyle's bagel!

00:09:15.173 --> 00:09:17.273
Here goes!

00:09:17.273 --> 00:09:18.273
Hey!

00:09:18.273 --> 00:09:19.407
Not cool!

00:09:19.407 --> 00:09:20.873
I was saving that!

00:09:20.873 --> 00:09:21.873
Hey, Dad...

00:09:21.873 --> 00:09:23.907
Xyz Summon!

00:09:23.907 --> 00:09:25.307
Xyz Summon?

00:09:26.607 --> 00:09:28.973
Since we're learning
about summoning today,

00:09:28.973 --> 00:09:31.273
can you teach us
how to Xyz Summon?

00:09:31.273 --> 00:09:32.907
No, I'm afraid not.

00:09:32.907 --> 00:09:35.673
After all, I can't teach
what I don't know!

00:09:35.673 --> 00:09:39.607
Xyz is one of the trickiest
types of summoning there is.

00:09:39.607 --> 00:09:42.840
Why, you know someone
who's mastered it, Zuzu?

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.007
I'm...

00:09:44.007 --> 00:09:45.240
Not sure...

00:09:52.173 --> 00:09:54.707
Uh, you cool?

00:09:54.707 --> 00:09:56.573
Yeah.

00:09:56.573 --> 00:09:58.107
Don't mind me.

00:10:01.607 --> 00:10:03.207
(Zuzu)
I just don't know
what to believe.

00:10:03.207 --> 00:10:05.407
Was that mystery duelist
Yuya or not?

00:10:05.407 --> 00:10:08.007
Should I trust in what I saw
or is there a better way to‐‐

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:09.540
(Gong)
How dare you!

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.940
You've made the Gong angry!

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.107
Now things get ugly!

00:10:15.107 --> 00:10:17.440
What now?

00:10:20.596 --> 00:10:22.529
What's the big brouhaha?

00:10:22.529 --> 00:10:24.329
Something's brewin'...

00:10:24.329 --> 00:10:26.362
But it's no
ha‐ha matter.

00:10:26.362 --> 00:10:29.496
Gong was working out doing
duel sprints when he saw some

00:10:29.496 --> 00:10:32.429
suspicious characters loitering
on your campus

00:10:32.429 --> 00:10:34.362
and confronted them!

00:10:34.362 --> 00:10:35.796
They're accusing Yuya

00:10:35.796 --> 00:10:38.362
of hurting their pal
Sylvio in a duel!

00:10:38.362 --> 00:10:39.962
Yuya?
Me‐ya?

00:10:39.962 --> 00:10:40.962
Don't lie!

00:10:40.962 --> 00:10:43.029
You totally know
it was you!

00:10:43.029 --> 00:10:44.062
Yeah that's right,

00:10:44.062 --> 00:10:46.329
we saw you with
our very own eyes!

00:10:46.329 --> 00:10:47.696
We sure did...

00:10:47.696 --> 00:10:49.196
And she did, too.

00:10:49.196 --> 00:10:50.996
Wait, she who?

00:10:50.996 --> 00:10:53.362
One of Yuya's good friends...

00:10:53.362 --> 00:10:54.629
Right... Zuzu?

00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:55.996
(both gasping)

00:10:58.596 --> 00:11:00.629
(all)
C'mon, it's true...

00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:03.129
Don't deny it, Zuzu!

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:04.529
(gasping)

00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:06.229
They're crazy,
Zuzu, right?

00:11:06.229 --> 00:11:07.696
They're making this all up.

00:11:07.696 --> 00:11:08.762
Or...

00:11:08.762 --> 00:11:10.129
Aren't they?

00:11:10.129 --> 00:11:12.096
(Clancy)
Making what up?

00:11:12.096 --> 00:11:16.096
That Zuzu was there and saw
everything that happened!

00:11:16.096 --> 00:11:17.529
Yuya, you're so through!

00:11:17.529 --> 00:11:18.729
(gasping)

00:11:18.729 --> 00:11:20.062
(Tate)
No, he's not!

00:11:20.062 --> 00:11:23.262
Yuya would never
hurt someone like you say!

00:11:23.262 --> 00:11:25.929
It was Sylvio who
wanted to hurt Yuya!

00:11:25.929 --> 00:11:27.296
And Zuzu only
confronted him

00:11:27.296 --> 00:11:29.262
'cause she
wanted to protect Yuya!

00:11:29.262 --> 00:11:30.762
Hold on there!

00:11:30.762 --> 00:11:33.529
You're saying that Zuzu
confronted Sylvio?

00:11:33.529 --> 00:11:34.562
Yeah!

00:11:34.562 --> 00:11:35.862
So then...

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:38.496
That means...
The true culprit's Zuzu?

00:11:38.496 --> 00:11:39.796
No!
No!
No!

00:11:39.796 --> 00:11:41.296
If this guy's
the teacher...

00:11:41.296 --> 00:11:43.629
I feel bad
for the students.

00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:46.396
Like we said,
Yuya's the guilty one!

00:11:46.396 --> 00:11:48.329
And now, poor Sylvio...

00:11:48.329 --> 00:11:50.229
He's holed up
in the hospital.

00:11:50.229 --> 00:11:51.529
For real?

00:11:51.529 --> 00:11:52.596
Oh, no!

00:11:52.596 --> 00:11:54.662
And they say...

00:11:54.662 --> 00:11:57.829
He may never
duel again!

00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:59.696
So tasty!

00:11:59.696 --> 00:12:01.762
(Clancy)
Poor, bedridden, Sylvio...

00:12:01.762 --> 00:12:03.762
How do you sleep
at night, Yuya?

00:12:03.762 --> 00:12:07.296
Uh... with pillows mostly.

00:12:07.296 --> 00:12:10.029
Zuzu, why don't
you say something.

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:11.162
You were there.

00:12:11.162 --> 00:12:13.196
You know I didn't
hurt Sylvio!

00:12:13.196 --> 00:12:14.196
Yeah.

00:12:14.196 --> 00:12:16.662
I was there, Yuya...

00:12:16.662 --> 00:12:19.262
Uh‐huh.
Ah!

00:12:19.262 --> 00:12:20.496
So strange...

00:12:20.496 --> 00:12:21.762
Was that Yuya?

00:12:21.762 --> 00:12:23.796
I just... don't know...

00:12:23.796 --> 00:12:24.862
Hold on...

00:12:24.862 --> 00:12:27.096
Are you saying I could
do this, Zuzu?

00:12:27.096 --> 00:12:28.162
No, I‐‐

00:12:30.462 --> 00:12:31.562
(sighing)

00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:35.996
(Clancy)
And there you have it.

00:12:35.996 --> 00:12:39.029
Your own friend won't
even defend you.

00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:40.696
And now you'll pay.
Pay?

00:12:40.696 --> 00:12:41.629
He'll pay how?

00:12:42.796 --> 00:12:44.229
(sirens approaching)

00:12:44.229 --> 00:12:45.829
Maybe you can
just pay with loose change,

00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:49.396
come on, everyone, empty out
your pockets now!

00:12:49.396 --> 00:12:52.096
(Madame Chairwoman)
Perhaps I can be
of some assistance.

00:12:54.962 --> 00:12:55.962
(Skip)
I know you.

00:12:55.962 --> 00:12:57.796
You're Henrietta Akaba...

00:12:57.796 --> 00:12:58.929
Yes.

00:12:58.929 --> 00:13:01.329
Chairwoman of the Leo Institute
of Dueling.

00:13:01.329 --> 00:13:04.029
Why don't we all
have a little talk?

00:13:07.429 --> 00:13:08.896
(Clancy)
We scared 'em all
real good just like you said.

00:13:08.896 --> 00:13:11.796
(Claude)
And here's your reward.

00:13:11.796 --> 00:13:14.996
Now then, off with you.

00:13:14.996 --> 00:13:16.796
Thank you for having me.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.196
(Skip)
It's our pleasure.

00:13:18.196 --> 00:13:20.829
I only wish it was under
better circumstances.

00:13:20.829 --> 00:13:23.929
But I'm afraid we must deal with
the facts and the facts are that

00:13:23.929 --> 00:13:26.729
Yuya has created
quite a row.

00:13:26.729 --> 00:13:29.996
And now we must figure out
a way to make things right.

00:13:33.296 --> 00:13:34.829
For the last time...

00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:35.962
Did you do this?

00:13:35.962 --> 00:13:37.796
No, no, no!

00:13:37.796 --> 00:13:39.796
Why doesn't anyone
here believe me?

00:13:39.796 --> 00:13:42.229
Not so fast there, Yuya.

00:13:42.229 --> 00:13:43.662
Gong does.

00:13:43.662 --> 00:13:45.529
Now who is with me?

00:13:45.529 --> 00:13:46.762
C'mon, speak up!

00:13:46.762 --> 00:13:48.429
We're all with you!

00:13:48.429 --> 00:13:50.262
(grunts)

00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:51.262
And you?

00:13:51.262 --> 00:13:52.796
(nervous groan)

00:13:55.962 --> 00:13:56.896
Yuya!

00:13:58.196 --> 00:14:00.429
I know what my eyes
saw on that day...

00:14:00.429 --> 00:14:02.829
But sometimes looks
can deceive...

00:14:06.696 --> 00:14:08.429
Humph.
I‐‐

00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:10.062
I...

00:14:10.062 --> 00:14:11.396
It's okay, Zuzu.

00:14:11.396 --> 00:14:12.829
Just...

00:14:12.829 --> 00:14:14.396
Just say what's
in your heart then.

00:14:16.762 --> 00:14:18.329
My heart?

00:14:18.329 --> 00:14:19.829
My heart says your innocent!

00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:21.429
How sweet.

00:14:21.429 --> 00:14:23.396
But that changes nothing.

00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:26.696
Because I have three witnesses
that say that Yuya is guilty.

00:14:27.929 --> 00:14:29.762
So unless you want me to get

00:14:29.762 --> 00:14:32.662
the authorities
involved in this,

00:14:32.662 --> 00:14:35.796
I strongly suggest that you
listen to my following proposal,

00:14:35.796 --> 00:14:37.096
and listen good.

00:14:37.096 --> 00:14:40.029
As you know, I am the Chairwoman
of the Leo Institute,

00:14:40.029 --> 00:14:42.829
the top duel school
in the whole world.

00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:45.062
So what's that
have to do with Yuya?

00:14:45.062 --> 00:14:47.029
Yuya made a fool
of our student!

00:14:47.029 --> 00:14:48.262
(gasping)

00:14:48.262 --> 00:14:50.662
This is now about honor!

00:14:50.662 --> 00:14:54.162
Honor that we
have all lost!

00:14:54.162 --> 00:14:56.662
But that we'll soon restore!

00:14:56.662 --> 00:14:59.462
By way of our students
battling in a duel!

00:15:01.196 --> 00:15:03.029
Is it hot or
is it just me?

00:15:03.029 --> 00:15:04.896
(gasping)

00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:09.396
If your school wins,

00:15:09.396 --> 00:15:12.596
then I'll forget
about the Yuya incident,

00:15:12.596 --> 00:15:15.962
but, if we win
the duel...

00:15:15.962 --> 00:15:17.529
Then effective immediately,

00:15:17.529 --> 00:15:20.762
the Leo Institute will take over
the You Show Duel School.

00:15:20.762 --> 00:15:22.329
Take over?

00:15:22.329 --> 00:15:23.396
No way!

00:15:23.396 --> 00:15:26.229
How's taking it
over restore honor?

00:15:26.229 --> 00:15:29.796
This seems pretty fishy,
if you ask Gong!

00:15:29.796 --> 00:15:31.496
Yes, I agree.

00:15:31.496 --> 00:15:34.296
Especially since I know
how the Leo Institute has been

00:15:34.296 --> 00:15:36.996
aggressively expanding
across the globe.

00:15:36.996 --> 00:15:39.762
You've been taking over duel
schools left and right,

00:15:39.762 --> 00:15:42.029
and not always
in the nicest ways.

00:15:42.029 --> 00:15:43.262
Tell me...

00:15:43.262 --> 00:15:46.229
Did you set this all up
simply to take our school?

00:15:46.229 --> 00:15:48.129
No, I did not.

00:15:48.129 --> 00:15:51.396
But, I happen to be an
opportunist, so...

00:15:51.396 --> 00:15:53.896
When I seen an opportunity
such as this,

00:15:53.896 --> 00:15:55.329
I can't resist.

00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:58.262
You see, there are three
ultimate summoning methods,

00:15:58.262 --> 00:15:59.529
Fusion,

00:15:59.529 --> 00:16:00.729
Synchro,

00:16:00.729 --> 00:16:02.329
and of course Xyz.

00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:03.762
But it's come to my attention

00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:05.562
that there is now
a fourth method,

00:16:05.562 --> 00:16:07.396
Pendulum.

00:16:07.396 --> 00:16:10.562
And though I don't know why or
how, you're the only school

00:16:10.562 --> 00:16:12.929
around that seems to have
any kind of connection to it.

00:16:14.796 --> 00:16:16.896
And with all due respect,

00:16:16.896 --> 00:16:20.829
the potential of Pendulum
Summoning is wasted here.

00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:24.562
However, with the technological
resources of the Leo Corporation

00:16:24.562 --> 00:16:26.562
it would positively flourish.

00:16:26.562 --> 00:16:28.396
Why, there's no telling of all
the new monsters

00:16:28.396 --> 00:16:30.396
and duel maneuvers
that could come of it.

00:16:30.396 --> 00:16:32.529
The possibilities
are endless.

00:16:32.529 --> 00:16:34.762
Come now,
doesn't that excite you?

00:16:34.762 --> 00:16:38.096
Yeah, but the only way to
Pendulum Summon

00:16:38.096 --> 00:16:39.929
is with Yuya's
Pendulum cards.

00:16:39.929 --> 00:16:43.829
So it would seem, little one,
but why don't you just letme

00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:45.062
worry about that?

00:16:45.062 --> 00:16:47.496
I'm certain that
I will be able to figure out

00:16:47.496 --> 00:16:49.529
some sort of solution.

00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:51.862
(Henrietta)
And the solution is obvious.

00:16:51.862 --> 00:16:54.362
When I take over the school,
I'll take over Yuya's deck.

00:16:54.362 --> 00:16:57.662
Then I'll get to the bottom of
this Pendulum business,

00:16:57.662 --> 00:17:00.896
and perhaps even more
importantly, determine whether

00:17:00.896 --> 00:17:03.796
Yuya is a friend or a foe.

00:17:03.796 --> 00:17:05.862
(Yuya)
You treat dueling
like it's a business...

00:17:05.862 --> 00:17:08.629
But here we believe it's all
about show business!

00:17:08.629 --> 00:17:10.029
Don't you see?

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:12.429
That's when dueling is
at its most powerful,

00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:14.496
when it's used
to make people happy!

00:17:14.496 --> 00:17:17.362
Not when it's used to push
people around in order to make

00:17:17.362 --> 00:17:19.429
some big shot
school even bigger!

00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:22.796
But if you really feel like your
school has lost its rep somehow

00:17:22.796 --> 00:17:25.529
and that the only way you can
get it back is by way of a duel

00:17:25.529 --> 00:17:26.629
then that's fine,

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:28.996
but that duel is gonna
have to be with me!

00:17:28.996 --> 00:17:30.696
(hushed groan)

00:17:30.696 --> 00:17:32.896
Atta boy, Yuya!

00:17:32.896 --> 00:17:36.196
Gong totally feels the exact
same way that you do!

00:17:36.196 --> 00:17:38.762
And because he does,
Gong's volunteering to face‐off

00:17:38.762 --> 00:17:39.962
in a match, as well!

00:17:39.962 --> 00:17:41.862
You can't duel!

00:17:41.862 --> 00:17:42.862
We'd lose for sure!

00:17:42.862 --> 00:17:44.696
(surprised gasp)

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:47.062
What I mean is, we'd be
disqualified because Gong

00:17:47.062 --> 00:17:50.529
doesn't go to You Show and she
said students have to duel.

00:17:50.529 --> 00:17:53.196
So forget the big guy back
there, if we're talking multiple

00:17:53.196 --> 00:17:54.196
duels, talk to me!

00:17:54.196 --> 00:17:56.362
Wait, did you say
forget about Gong?

00:17:56.362 --> 00:17:58.762
That's totally
unacceptable!

00:17:58.762 --> 00:18:01.529
Gong wants to duel,
Gong needs to duel!

00:18:01.529 --> 00:18:03.696
It seems your students
have agreed to my terms,

00:18:03.696 --> 00:18:05.329
but what say you?

00:18:06.396 --> 00:18:09.629
What I say,
Madame Chairwoman...

00:18:09.629 --> 00:18:11.529
... is you have a deal!

00:18:11.529 --> 00:18:12.896
(all)
Let's duel!

00:18:17.329 --> 00:18:19.529
♪

00:18:20.423 --> 00:18:22.323
So that we're all in agreement,

00:18:22.323 --> 00:18:25.356
we will have three separate
matches between three duelists

00:18:25.356 --> 00:18:27.223
from my school
and three from yours.

00:18:27.223 --> 00:18:29.223
Now then,
who's first?

00:18:29.223 --> 00:18:30.656
Right here!

00:18:30.656 --> 00:18:32.256
No, me!

00:18:32.256 --> 00:18:34.756
A wise choice.

00:18:34.756 --> 00:18:37.423
Starting your
strongest duelist first.

00:18:37.423 --> 00:18:39.323
After all, getting blown out
in your first match

00:18:39.323 --> 00:18:40.823
would be demoralizing.

00:18:40.823 --> 00:18:42.590
Save the weak for last...

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:43.990
(Sora)
Who are you calling weak?

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.356
Let's arm wrestle,
right now, you and me!

00:18:46.356 --> 00:18:47.356
(nervous laughing)

00:18:47.356 --> 00:18:48.456
Keep it together...

00:18:48.456 --> 00:18:51.823
Although, I highly doubt
that it will matter much

00:18:51.823 --> 00:18:53.556
whoever duels first.

00:18:53.556 --> 00:18:55.423
You see, the students
I've brought over

00:18:55.423 --> 00:18:58.056
from the Leo Institute
are at the top of their class

00:18:58.056 --> 00:19:01.690
and each one of them specializes
in a unique style of play.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:05.390
The one facing Yuya
will be Dipper.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.356
That's my name, and don't you
dare forget it,

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:09.656
or you'll pay...

00:19:09.656 --> 00:19:11.923
We'll pay how?

00:19:14.023 --> 00:19:15.023

His record
is off the charts!

When you're getting
ready for battle, Yuya,

there's just
one way to go!

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.023
And that's with a battle cry!

00:19:33.023 --> 00:19:34.490
You ready?

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:35.690
Let's go!
