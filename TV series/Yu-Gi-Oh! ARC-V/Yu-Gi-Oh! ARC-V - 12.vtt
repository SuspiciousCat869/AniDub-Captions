00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:04.000
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V..."

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.266
Yuya won, Zuzu lost,
and Gong ended up tying.

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:13.233
Madame Chairwoman, the deal was
you'd take over this school

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:16.633
if your team won the best
of a three‐match contest.

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:20.666
Your team only won one duel,
so the school stays ours.

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.500
That's absolute nonsense.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.133
This duel is supposed to be
the tie‐breaker.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.300
The contest can't be
decided by a draw.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.466
It was a tie!

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.433
The last duel is over.

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:33.566
Then we'll have another duel.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.466
The ones who won their duels can
duel against each other now.

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.766
Agreed?

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.266
You shouldn't
get to decide!

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.166
Leave it up to the duelists.

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:47.233
Your boy looks like he's
raring to go, and so are we.

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:48.166
Wait.

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.100
(all)
Huh?

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:54.500
I'll be the one to duel.

Poor Yuya must be
a nervous wreck!

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:09.900
If he doesn't win...

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.266
Our school's theirs.

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:12.800
Yuya...

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.966
Forgive Gong for failing ya!

00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:17.600
Gong wanted to save
the You Show School.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.633
But it wasn't meant to be.

00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:21.900
Now it's come down to
one final duel

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.966
and all the pressure's
on you.

00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:25.800
No, it's not.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.766
Huh?

00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:28.200
It looks to me like Yuya's

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.466
as cool as a penguin
on an iceberg.

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:32.966
I bet he's psyched that
it's all come down to him

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:35.500
winning this one last duel.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.633
The future of my school's
at stake.

00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:40.533
But I'm up for the challenge!

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:43.800
(Tatsuya)
All you Leo fanatics
better watch out!

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.900
(Futoshi) Your team is strong,
but we have Pendulum power!

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.200
We can't lose
with Yuya on our side!

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.266
(Tatsuya) It's gonna be
Yuya all the way!

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:52.466
He's number one!

00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:55.133
(Himika) You children are
incredibly naive.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.566
Seriously, your poor friend

00:02:57.566 --> 00:02:59.433
doesn't stand a chance
against Declan.

00:02:59.433 --> 00:03:02.200
(gasps)
Declan?

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.600
The time for talk is over,
don't you agree?

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.900
Out on the dueling field,
it's actions that count.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.233
Words mean nothing.

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:14.866
I feel like I've seen
that guy before.

00:03:14.866 --> 00:03:16.766
Uh, let's see now...

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:20.466
Declan Akaba.
Interesting.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:31.233
He looks scary!

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:33.600
Don't worry Ally,
it will all be okay.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.100
Yuya can
handle him easily.

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:45.633
But why does he look
so worried?

00:03:45.633 --> 00:03:47.933
(Yuzu)
Hey, Yuya, perk up!

00:03:47.933 --> 00:03:49.666
Huh?

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:51.133
Don't forget!

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:53.766
You Show trains us
to be dueltainers!

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:56.366
Your greatest asset
is your smile!

00:03:56.366 --> 00:03:58.366
My smile?

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:02.333
She's right.

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:04.566
I can't let the pressure
of competition

00:04:04.566 --> 00:04:06.400
throw me off my game.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.733
My number one priority
has to be to have fun.

00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:12.633
Let's make this
the most awesome duel ever!

00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:16.133
Hope you guys are ready
'cause this is gonna be epic!

00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:17.366
‐ All right!
‐ Go for it!

00:04:17.366 --> 00:04:18.333
‐ Do it, Yuya!

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:21.400
Good. I can't wait
to see that grin

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.066
wiped off his face.

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:25.500
We need to pick
an Action Field.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.300
Your school, your choice.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.766
Pick a good one!

00:04:29.766 --> 00:04:31.800
(thinking)
Yuya's leaving it up to me.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.900
I honestly don't think
he understands

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.300
what he's up against.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.000
Declan's won every dueling prize
out there.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.566
He's a pro.

00:04:39.566 --> 00:04:41.933
Yuya's gonna need
every advantage he can get,

00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:44.133
and since Declan says
he doesn't care,

00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:45.933
then I'm free
to choose a field

00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:48.600
that suits Yuya's talents
to a T.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.433
Get set to duel
under the big top!

00:04:50.433 --> 00:04:53.466
I activate
the Action Field spell...

00:04:53.466 --> 00:04:56.166
Acrobatic Circus!

00:04:57.733 --> 00:05:00.766
(Computer)Reality combat system
energized.

00:05:00.766 --> 00:05:03.433
<i>Generating action field.</i>

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.300
Only thing missing
are clowns.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.133
Don't you worry none.
Yuya's got that covered.

00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:20.000
Since his whole life's
a circus,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.766
this field's
perfect for him.

00:05:21.766 --> 00:05:24.233
Well, the stage
is all set, Yuya.

00:05:24.233 --> 00:05:26.566
The rest is up to you now.

00:05:35.533 --> 00:05:38.933
The Leo Institute has
chosen its champion!

00:05:38.933 --> 00:05:42.166
Declan is set to take on
You Show's star student...

00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:44.833
The amazing Yuya Sakaki!

00:05:44.833 --> 00:05:48.400
You're about to witness
the ultimate School Duel!

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.300
(all)
So get ready to Action...

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.100
(both)
...Duel.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.144
Since you did me a favor by
letting me choose the field,

00:05:59.144 --> 00:06:01.078
I'll let you go first.

00:06:01.078 --> 00:06:04.544
You really believe I was
doing you a favor, don't you?

00:06:04.544 --> 00:06:08.544
Ha. That tells me a lot about
what kind of competitor you are.

00:06:08.544 --> 00:06:11.811
All right.
I will accept your offer.

00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:13.578
The first turn's mine.

00:06:13.578 --> 00:06:17.611
To begin, I'm going to activate
three spell cards from my hand.

00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:19.844
First this one.

00:06:19.844 --> 00:06:21.711
This legally binding spell
is known as

00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:24.244
Dark Contract With the Gate.

00:06:24.244 --> 00:06:27.311
This spell deals me
1,000 points of damage

00:06:27.311 --> 00:06:30.978
at the beginning
of my next turn.

00:06:30.978 --> 00:06:34.044
Huh?
That move makes no sense!

00:06:34.044 --> 00:06:36.244
Yeah, it's like he tryin' to
throw the duel away

00:06:36.244 --> 00:06:38.011
when it's just starting!

00:06:38.011 --> 00:06:40.944
However, there is a benefit.

00:06:40.944 --> 00:06:43.644
Once each turn,
I can add a Double‐D monster

00:06:43.644 --> 00:06:47.311
that's Level 4 or below
to my hand from my deck.

00:06:47.311 --> 00:06:52.244
I would like to introduce you
to my Double‐D Cerberus.

00:06:52.244 --> 00:06:53.711
Double‐D?

00:06:53.711 --> 00:06:55.578
It stands for
"Different Dimension."

00:06:55.578 --> 00:06:57.911
Those monsters are
out of this world.

00:06:57.911 --> 00:07:01.644
For my second move, I will
activate this spell card.

00:07:01.644 --> 00:07:04.111
It's the same one
I used before.

00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:05.311
What!?

00:07:05.311 --> 00:07:08.078
By doing that,
when his next turn comes up...

00:07:08.078 --> 00:07:10.578
He'll be 2,000 points
weaker!

00:07:10.578 --> 00:07:12.678
(grunts)

00:07:12.678 --> 00:07:15.078
Once again,
I have the power

00:07:15.078 --> 00:07:17.044
to add a Double‐D monster
to my hand

00:07:17.044 --> 00:07:18.944
if it is Level 4 or below.

00:07:18.944 --> 00:07:22.378
In this case, the monster
will be Double‐D Lilith.

00:07:22.378 --> 00:07:25.911
And now I will activate
a third spell card.

00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:28.578
It's called Dark Contract
with the Swamp King,

00:07:28.578 --> 00:07:30.778
and like my
other Contract spells,

00:07:30.778 --> 00:07:33.278
once my next turn starts,
I get hit with

00:07:33.278 --> 00:07:36.244
1,000 points of damage.

00:07:36.244 --> 00:07:39.044
Declan seems to be
taking a huge risk.

00:07:39.044 --> 00:07:42.344
He must have something
major up his sleeve.

00:07:42.344 --> 00:07:45.678
It's not up my sleeve,
but in my deck, Yuya.

00:07:45.678 --> 00:07:48.511
With the power of Dark Contract
With the Swamp King,

00:07:48.511 --> 00:07:52.044
I can summon a Fusion monster
without using a Fusion spell.

00:07:52.044 --> 00:07:56.644
Huh?
So that's his strategy!
Now I get it.

00:07:56.644 --> 00:07:59.744
Don't kid yourself.
You understand nothing!

00:07:59.744 --> 00:08:03.178
Watch as I fuse Cerberus
and Lilith together!

00:08:04.978 --> 00:08:09.644
I Fusion Summon Triple‐D Flame
King Genghis!

00:08:17.178 --> 00:08:19.278
Oh, man.

00:08:19.278 --> 00:08:21.344
The guy is
a fusion master!

00:08:21.344 --> 00:08:23.378
Still, he put
a lot of points at risk

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:25.278
for one monster,
don't you think?

00:08:25.278 --> 00:08:27.578
This one must be
really powerful!

00:08:27.578 --> 00:08:29.011
It has three D's!

00:08:29.011 --> 00:08:31.244
That's a lot of letters!

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:35.211
I got... a bad feeling.

00:08:35.211 --> 00:08:37.444
I can't pin it down exactly,

00:08:37.444 --> 00:08:41.178
but if it's as powerful
as it is terrifying,

00:08:41.178 --> 00:08:43.411
then Yuya's in for trouble.

00:08:43.411 --> 00:08:45.511
I can't find any record

00:08:45.511 --> 00:08:47.878
of Declan Akaba using
Fusion Summoning

00:08:47.878 --> 00:08:49.878
in a duel before.

00:08:49.878 --> 00:08:51.644
He has an incredible
string of victories,

00:08:51.644 --> 00:08:53.811
and now he's even
more powerful?

00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:57.411
This isn't looking very
good for Yuya...

00:08:57.411 --> 00:09:01.278
or for the You Show School!

00:09:03.744 --> 00:09:06.378
I'm placing two cards
facedown.

00:09:06.378 --> 00:09:08.511
It's your move.

00:09:08.511 --> 00:09:11.544
He played all the cards
in his hand.

00:09:11.544 --> 00:09:13.811
That's a really risky move.

00:09:27.411 --> 00:09:30.111
Mr. Sunshine there
sure is full of himself.

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:31.644
If he's such a great duelist,

00:09:31.644 --> 00:09:34.278
his school wouldn't have left
him on the bench until now.

00:09:34.278 --> 00:09:35.511
Good point.

00:09:35.511 --> 00:09:36.878
He could be overconfident.

00:09:36.878 --> 00:09:38.178
(all)
Huh?

00:09:38.178 --> 00:09:40.644
Declan must think he's
way more skilled than Yuya,

00:09:40.644 --> 00:09:43.811
'cause he's practically
spotting him 3,000 points
at the start.

00:09:43.811 --> 00:09:45.544
He's right!

00:09:45.544 --> 00:09:47.111
If there's one thing
Gong can't abide,

00:09:47.111 --> 00:09:48.744
it's a hot‐doggin'
duelist!

00:09:48.744 --> 00:09:50.378
That skunk!

00:09:50.378 --> 00:09:52.778
He deserves to
get his deck demolished!

00:09:52.778 --> 00:09:54.811
Put him in his place, Yuya!

00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:57.511
That's right! Show him
you're the best duelist!

00:09:57.511 --> 00:10:00.778
Ja, shred that guy
like a bowl of sauerkraut!

00:10:00.778 --> 00:10:01.778
Right!

00:10:01.778 --> 00:10:04.178
I'll defeat Declan all right,

00:10:04.178 --> 00:10:06.711
but I'll do it with flair!

00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:08.178
It's showtime!

00:10:08.178 --> 00:10:09.511
Hyah!

00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:14.311
Please welcome,
Performapal Whip Snake!

00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:15.611
Hyah!

00:10:20.844 --> 00:10:24.244
All right, Whip Snake,
use your special ability!

00:10:24.244 --> 00:10:27.311
It can hypnotize your monster
into swapping its attack

00:10:27.311 --> 00:10:30.011
and defense points!

00:10:35.278 --> 00:10:37.811
And just like that,
it weakens Flame King!

00:10:37.811 --> 00:10:41.411
Which means Whip Snake is
perfectly set up to strike now!

00:10:41.411 --> 00:10:42.744
Nice going!

00:10:42.744 --> 00:10:45.211
<i>Wunderbar!</i>

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:46.744
It's go time!

00:10:46.744 --> 00:10:49.744
Whip Snake, extinguish
that Fire King!

00:10:51.744 --> 00:10:54.378
You won't be putting
anything out!

00:10:54.378 --> 00:10:57.378
I activate the trap
Dark Contract With the Witch!

00:10:57.378 --> 00:10:59.311
A Contract again!?

00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:00.478
That means...

00:11:00.478 --> 00:11:03.078
I will once again
take damage at the beginning

00:11:03.078 --> 00:11:04.778
of my next turn.

00:11:04.778 --> 00:11:07.444
Another 1,000 points
to be exact.

00:11:07.444 --> 00:11:09.178
Hmm?

00:11:09.178 --> 00:11:11.444
Meanwhile,
my Flame King Genghis

00:11:11.444 --> 00:11:16.011
will benefit
by gaining 1,000 attack points.

00:11:16.011 --> 00:11:20.378
(Futoshi)
But that mean's Whip Snake's
attack will go kerplunk!

00:11:22.378 --> 00:11:24.078
I've got a few tricks
of my own,

00:11:24.078 --> 00:11:26.378
including my High Dive!

00:11:26.378 --> 00:11:29.211
This amazing Action Card
will boost Whip Snake

00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:32.744
by 1,000 attack points
till the end of my turn!

00:11:37.644 --> 00:11:41.878
Okay, Whip Snake, get back
to work and K. O. that King!

00:11:57.578 --> 00:11:58.778
(all)
Oh, yeah!

00:12:02.744 --> 00:12:04.611
(Futoshi)
Wait! What happened!?

00:12:04.611 --> 00:12:05.544
(Tatsuya)
Uh‐oh!

00:12:09.111 --> 00:12:10.878
(all gasp)

00:12:13.078 --> 00:12:14.911
He survived?

00:12:14.911 --> 00:12:18.711
Yes, because I activated
an Action Card of my own.

00:12:18.711 --> 00:12:22.044
The spell card Evasion
to be precise.

00:12:24.878 --> 00:12:27.244
Couldn't have
done it better myself.

00:12:29.644 --> 00:12:33.111
Huh? Seems to be
an even match.

00:12:33.111 --> 00:12:34.378
Well, I disagree!

00:12:34.378 --> 00:12:37.378
Yeah, Declan still has to
pay off four Contracts.

00:12:37.378 --> 00:12:39.178
When they come due
at the start of his turn,

00:12:39.178 --> 00:12:41.611
they'll cost him
4,000 life points.

00:12:41.611 --> 00:12:42.844
He's toast!

00:12:42.844 --> 00:12:45.678
(Yuzu) All Yuya has to do
is end his turn now,

00:12:45.678 --> 00:12:48.044
and Declan won't know
what hit him!

00:12:48.044 --> 00:12:50.278
Yeah, and then
it'll be game over!

00:12:50.278 --> 00:12:51.678
Easy‐peasy!

00:12:51.678 --> 00:12:53.678
Declan blundered big time!

00:12:53.678 --> 00:12:56.344
Don't judge a candy bar
by its wrapper.

00:12:56.344 --> 00:12:57.811
Think about it, guys.

00:12:57.811 --> 00:12:59.744
Why would he leave himself
so defenseless

00:12:59.744 --> 00:13:01.644
unless he had other plans?

00:13:01.644 --> 00:13:03.978
Did you notice what happened
when Whip Snake

00:13:03.978 --> 00:13:05.111
attacked his King?

00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:07.678
Just before impact,
Genghis's attack points

00:13:07.678 --> 00:13:09.711
went back down to 1,500.

00:13:09.711 --> 00:13:11.678
There had to be a reason.

00:13:11.678 --> 00:13:14.111
It makes sense for Yuya to go
for the easy win here,

00:13:14.111 --> 00:13:16.211
but if he does,
I'm afraid he could be

00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:19.711
marching straight into
an enemy trap!

00:13:27.278 --> 00:13:28.711
(chuckling)

00:13:28.711 --> 00:13:30.711
I don't see
what's so funny.

00:13:30.711 --> 00:13:32.278
Of course you don't.

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:35.278
What made me laugh was
remembering the moment

00:13:35.278 --> 00:13:36.978
when you said you would
do me a favor

00:13:36.978 --> 00:13:38.278
and let me go first.

00:13:38.278 --> 00:13:39.811
(gasps)

00:13:39.811 --> 00:13:43.444
It's clear from your attitude
that you're a nice guy, Yuya.

00:13:43.444 --> 00:13:47.344
But alas, you haven't learned
yet that in a duel,

00:13:47.344 --> 00:13:48.916
playing "nice" is the quickest
path to defeat.

00:13:48.916 --> 00:13:53.049
By ending your turn now,
you know you can achieve victory

00:13:53.049 --> 00:13:54.949
and yet you haven't
made a move.

00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:58.549
Perhaps since you're a nice guy,
your sense of fair play

00:13:58.549 --> 00:14:00.483
has caused you to hesitate.

00:14:00.483 --> 00:14:04.883
Such weakness will inevitably
lead to your downfall.

00:14:04.883 --> 00:14:06.816
What is he yakking about!

00:14:06.816 --> 00:14:08.449
It don't make
no difference!

00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:10.083
Ignore him, Yuya!

00:14:10.083 --> 00:14:11.583
Just end your turn!

00:14:15.083 --> 00:14:18.149
I'm afraid this is it
for you, Declan.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:20.216
I'm ending my turn.

00:14:20.216 --> 00:14:23.016
Whip Snake's special ability
wears off now,

00:14:23.016 --> 00:14:25.183
so Genghis's attack
and defense points

00:14:25.183 --> 00:14:29.649
will switch back to
their original totals.

00:14:29.649 --> 00:14:32.649
High Dive's effect will
also wear off now.

00:14:32.649 --> 00:14:36.583
Whip Snake's attack points
go back to normal, too.

00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:40.816
And now, you have to pay off
all the Contracts you activated.

00:14:40.816 --> 00:14:44.483
That will cost you
4,000 life points!

00:14:46.649 --> 00:14:48.383
Excuse me?

00:14:48.383 --> 00:14:50.083
What Contracts?

00:14:53.116 --> 00:14:54.083
(all gasp)

00:14:54.083 --> 00:14:55.516
Where did they all go!?

00:14:55.516 --> 00:14:57.883
My Contracts have
all been broken.

00:14:57.883 --> 00:15:00.349
If you had been paying
close attention,

00:15:00.349 --> 00:15:03.383
you would have noticed that
I activated a trap.

00:15:03.383 --> 00:15:05.316
With Contract Laundering,

00:15:05.316 --> 00:15:07.816
I negated the effects
of all my Contracts

00:15:07.816 --> 00:15:09.849
and destroyed them.

00:15:09.849 --> 00:15:12.416
I guess it's true
what they say‐‐

00:15:12.416 --> 00:15:15.083
a contract is only as good
as the card it's written on.

00:15:15.083 --> 00:15:16.283
Of course!

00:15:16.283 --> 00:15:17.483
The Contract that boosted

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:19.649
Genghis's attack points
was negated,

00:15:19.649 --> 00:15:21.716
so when I noticed them
returning to normal,

00:15:21.716 --> 00:15:22.849
that was why!

00:15:22.849 --> 00:15:25.183
Since he put the kibosh
on those Contracts,

00:15:25.183 --> 00:15:26.416
he doesn't take any damage!

00:15:26.416 --> 00:15:30.749
Lastly, I draw one card
for each Contract I destroyed.

00:15:30.749 --> 00:15:32.849
The duel continues, Yuya!

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:34.649
(growling)

00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:37.383
I'll be honest with you,
Declan.

00:15:37.383 --> 00:15:39.283
I'm glad I didn't
defeat you just now

00:15:39.283 --> 00:15:40.716
for one important reason.

00:15:40.716 --> 00:15:42.916
It would've been too easy.

00:15:42.916 --> 00:15:45.749
Now I can win with the kind of
dueltaining performance

00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:47.383
I learned from my dad!

00:15:47.383 --> 00:15:50.349
So then you're carrying on
Yusho Sakaki's legacy?

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:52.683
Huh? You know my dad?

00:15:52.683 --> 00:15:55.249
(cackling)
Are you serious?

00:15:55.249 --> 00:15:57.183
How could we not know him?

00:15:57.183 --> 00:16:00.016
After all, your old man
was a famous duelist!

00:16:00.016 --> 00:16:03.049
Yeah, famous for being
a complete chicken!

00:16:03.049 --> 00:16:05.449
Be quiet!

00:16:05.449 --> 00:16:07.116
Clowns.

00:16:07.116 --> 00:16:09.949
Sorry.

00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:13.449
I greatly admire
your father's exploits.

00:16:13.449 --> 00:16:15.516
Yusho Sakaki made
Action Dueling

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:18.249
as popular and exciting
as it is today.

00:16:18.249 --> 00:16:20.583
He was a true pioneer.

00:16:20.583 --> 00:16:23.116
I've long wanted
to test myself

00:16:23.116 --> 00:16:27.049
against his dueling philosophy,
and now I have the chance.

00:16:27.049 --> 00:16:29.349
We must use all our skills.

00:16:29.349 --> 00:16:31.816
From here on out,
I won't hold back.

00:16:31.816 --> 00:16:33.516
Won't hold back?

00:16:33.516 --> 00:16:35.283
So you've been
holding back!?

00:16:35.283 --> 00:16:37.549
Perhaps.

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:43.183
From here on out,
I won't hold back.

00:16:43.183 --> 00:16:44.816
Won't hold back?

00:16:44.816 --> 00:16:46.683
So you've been
holding back!?

00:16:46.683 --> 00:16:47.749
Perhaps.

00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:50.983
I draw!

00:16:50.983 --> 00:16:53.916
I'll summon
a Level 3 Tuner Monster!

00:16:53.916 --> 00:16:56.449
My Double‐D Nightowl!

00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:58.016
(roaring)

00:16:58.016 --> 00:17:01.083
A Tuner Monster?

00:17:01.083 --> 00:17:02.013
More like a Tooth Monster!

00:17:02.013 --> 00:17:03.813
Perfect.

00:17:03.813 --> 00:17:06.313
Now the real duel can begin.

00:17:06.313 --> 00:17:08.513
Once I've summoned
this monster,

00:17:08.513 --> 00:17:10.113
I can summon another.

00:17:10.113 --> 00:17:12.079
It must be a Double‐D monster

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.879
that's Level 4 or below
in my graveyard,

00:17:14.879 --> 00:17:17.113
and I have to reduce
its attack points

00:17:17.113 --> 00:17:18.879
all the way to zero.

00:17:18.879 --> 00:17:22.713
I have decided to revive
Double‐D Lilith!

00:17:27.879 --> 00:17:29.346
(whimpering)

00:17:29.346 --> 00:17:32.346
I tune my Level 3 Double‐D
Nightowl

00:17:32.346 --> 00:17:35.013
with my Level 4 Lilith!

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:36.846
(growling)

00:17:43.379 --> 00:17:45.113
(growling)

00:17:58.046 --> 00:18:03.579
I Synchro Summon Level 7
Triple‐D Gust King Alexander!

00:18:08.246 --> 00:18:11.113
A Synchro Monster?

00:18:11.113 --> 00:18:14.213
(all gasp)

00:18:14.213 --> 00:18:15.846
So, he can
Synchro Summon, too?

00:18:15.846 --> 00:18:18.779
I wonder what else
that guy's been hiding!

00:18:18.779 --> 00:18:20.079
I'm not finished.

00:18:20.079 --> 00:18:23.346
Flame King Genghis,
activate your special ability

00:18:23.346 --> 00:18:25.579
and turn up the heat!

00:18:26.646 --> 00:18:28.179
When a Triple‐D monster

00:18:28.179 --> 00:18:31.446
other than my Flame King Genghis
is summoned,

00:18:31.446 --> 00:18:33.813
I'm then allowed to summon
a Double‐D monster

00:18:33.813 --> 00:18:35.146
from my graveyard.

00:18:35.146 --> 00:18:37.313
And that's what I'll do!

00:18:37.313 --> 00:18:41.479
Arise once again,
Double‐D Lilith!

00:18:43.246 --> 00:18:47.213
And as a further twist,
Triple‐D Gust King Alexander's

00:18:47.213 --> 00:18:49.313
special ability activates!

00:18:49.313 --> 00:18:51.846
Whenever a Double‐D monster
is summoned,

00:18:51.846 --> 00:18:54.813
my Gust King can command
another Double‐D monster

00:18:54.813 --> 00:18:59.279
to rise from the graveyard
as it will now.

00:18:59.279 --> 00:19:01.779
Return to me,
Double‐D Cerberus!

00:19:05.446 --> 00:19:10.379
And now, Yuya, I intend to
Overlay my Cerberus and Lilith.

00:19:10.379 --> 00:19:13.279
So it begins!

00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:14.546
What's beginning!?

00:19:14.546 --> 00:19:16.846
Your downfall, of course!

00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:20.146
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:19:20.146 --> 00:19:22.779
I promise you have never
faced a warrior‐king

00:19:22.779 --> 00:19:26.046
as magnificent or commanding
as this one.

00:19:26.046 --> 00:19:27.879
I Xyz Summon!

00:19:27.879 --> 00:19:31.246
Triple‐D Wave King Caesar!

00:19:35.946 --> 00:19:38.513
He can summon
Xyz Monsters, too?

00:19:38.513 --> 00:19:40.646
This is blowing Gong's mind!

00:19:43.813 --> 00:19:45.546
(sinister laugh)

00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:51.679
(whimpering)

00:19:51.679 --> 00:19:54.479
He can summon
three different ways?

00:19:54.479 --> 00:19:56.879
That's amazing!

00:19:56.879 --> 00:19:59.979
I've never seen a duelist
command such power!

00:19:59.979 --> 00:20:02.446
I should warn you
that I have not even begun

00:20:02.446 --> 00:20:05.346
to unleash my most
powerful monsters.

00:20:05.346 --> 00:20:06.946
The worst is yet to come.

00:20:06.946 --> 00:20:10.613
That sounds rather terrifying,
don't you think?

00:20:10.613 --> 00:20:14.846
I can assure you that
the reality is far worse

00:20:14.846 --> 00:20:16.879
(sinister laugh)

00:23:03.246 --> 00:23:06.246
