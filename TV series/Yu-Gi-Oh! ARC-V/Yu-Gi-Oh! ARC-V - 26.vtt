WEBVTT

00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.533
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V."

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.766
So who are you?

00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:12.400
Declan Akaba.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.333
The current president
of Leo Corporation.

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.733
Leo Akaba's son.

00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.866
It's time to take
you down, Declan!

00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.800
Your despicable
father has Lulu,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.200
and I'll do anything and
everything to get her back.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.766
And that includes
using you as bait!

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.633
If you do exactly
what I ask,

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:32.900
and if you do
it successfully,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.700
then I'll agree to
be your opponent.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.166
And if by some
chance you win,

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:41.666
you may do whatever
you like with me.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.433
If you are able
to defeat the man

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:45.433
who has been your
loyal protector,

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:46.533
you will prevent him

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.100
from entering the Junior
Arc League Championship.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.066
I have forbidden
your cheering section

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.833
from attending this
crucial match

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:55.300
to see if you
can win on your own.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.533
I give you
Sensei Strong.

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.133
Earn your way into the Junior
Arc League Championship

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.866
using our unbeatable,
Heavystrong style!

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.466
(both)
Duel!

00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.166
Watch this,
Daddy!

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.800
I summon the Tuner Monster
Superheavy Samurai Trumpeter!

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.200
I can't
believe it!

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.700
He's Synchro Summoning!

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.133
(gasping)

00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:20.133
I Synchro Summon
my Level 10

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.766
Superheavy Samurai
Warlord Susanowo!

00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.633
This is when the real
battle begins between us

00:01:28.633 --> 00:01:30.033
and your dream ends.

Gong Synchro Summoned.

00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:45.833
Gong's sure working
his dojo mojo!

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:51.000
(Zuzu)
Yuya...

00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:55.000
Gong ain't playing
around.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.833
Gong's gonna do whatever
it takes to win this duel.

00:02:57.833 --> 00:02:59.800
And believe me,
Gong will.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.300
(Sensei Strong)
Stop right there!

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.266
I do so declare that my son Gong
has just lost this match.

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:08.033
(Zuzu)
But they're just
getting started.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.833
(all)
Why did he lose?

00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:14.733
A heart that remains
strong and steady

00:03:14.733 --> 00:03:17.566
is the foundation of
the Heavystrong style.

00:03:17.566 --> 00:03:19.400
You lost the moment
you stole a technique

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.600
from another school
in order to win.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.200
Gong didn't steal
no Synchro technique.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.233
Gong begged 'em to
teach it to me.

00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:28.633
Who did you beg?

00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:30.366
Who taught you?

00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:33.100
(Gong)
Who else?
Kit Blade.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.966
(Yuya)
The Synchro Summoner from
the Leo Institute.

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:37.700
But he's the guy
who almost beat you.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.766
And that's exactly why
Gong wanted to learn

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:42.500
everything Gong could
about how Kit almost did it.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.266
So Gong swallowed
his pride.

00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:46.566
But Gong didn't wanna
learn to Synchro Summon

00:03:46.566 --> 00:03:48.866
so Gong could win
duels with it.

00:03:48.866 --> 00:03:50.166
Gong learned it
so Gong could create

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:52.433
a whole New Heavystrong
Duel style.

00:03:52.433 --> 00:03:55.366
A new kind of
Heavystrong Duel style?

00:03:55.366 --> 00:03:57.433
We can't just stand
still, Daddy.

00:03:57.433 --> 00:04:00.633
Why, our Heavystrong Duel
style's gotta keep changin'

00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:02.233
and growin' an'
evolvin'

00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:06.866
or else it's gonna die
out like the dinosaurs.

00:04:06.866 --> 00:04:09.200
Let Gong try to prove it
to you in this one battle

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.800
and then you can make
up your mind.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.633
Superheavy Samurai
Warlord Susanowo's

00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:16.466
allowed to attack
while it's in defense mode

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:17.766
by usin' its defense
points.

00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:25.200
Now let's show 'em
what we got, Susanowo.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.000
Attack Performapal
Silver Claw.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.066
Swinging Sword Slash!

00:04:31.933 --> 00:04:35.633
I activate Evasion
to evade your attack.

00:04:35.633 --> 00:04:37.000
Oh, yeah?!

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.533
Well, we'll see
about that.

00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:40.066
Since Susanowo
is in defense mode

00:04:40.066 --> 00:04:42.633
and I have no spell cards
in my graveyard.

00:04:42.633 --> 00:04:45.566
Then Gong pays
500 life points

00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:47.766
to use a spell card
from your graveyard!

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.200
Gong activates
the Action Spell, Over Sword!

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.700
It gives my Susanowo 500
more attack points.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.933
Hold on, even if Gong
raises its attack points,

00:05:02.933 --> 00:05:05.500
Susanowo's attacking
with defense points.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.300
Gong's doing this
because Over Sword

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.766
has another effect he
wants, believe me.

00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:13.800
Sorry pal, but you're not
avoidin' Susanowo's attack

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.333
'cause Over Sword's
not gonna let you.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.466
I think that
oughta do for now.

00:05:24.466 --> 00:05:26.300
Bravissimo.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.966
Your son made a
marvelous mash‐up

00:05:27.966 --> 00:05:30.933
using the power of an Action
Card with his Synchro Monster.

00:05:30.933 --> 00:05:32.633
It's a quantum leap
beyond the classic

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:34.400
Heavystrong style,
wouldn't you say?

00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:40.633
(Yuya)
I gotta hand it to you,
Gong, that was great.

00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:44.166
You really mastered
Synchro Summoning.

00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:46.166
You're a real
inspiration.

00:05:46.166 --> 00:05:48.200
So I'm gonna
step up my game.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.400
Time to swing this
duel my way!

00:05:57.666 --> 00:05:59.566
You're a real
inspiration.

00:05:59.566 --> 00:06:01.633
So I'm gonna
step up my game.

00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:05.500
Time to swing this
duel my way.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.333
(Yuya)
Stargazer Magician.

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:09.500
The last time you took
center stage,

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.233
I was able to
fuse you with Odd‐Eyes

00:06:11.233 --> 00:06:13.866
to call out an all
new cast member,

00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:16.500
Rune‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.166
But wait.

00:06:18.166 --> 00:06:20.000
I was only able
to Pendulum Fusion

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.700
because I had Zuzu's
Polymerization.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.066
And now I don't.

00:06:26.066 --> 00:06:28.100
There's gotta be another
way for me to max out

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.000
my Pendulum power
without Polymerization.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.666
I know my deck won't
let me down.

00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:39.300
It's showtime!

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.166
I'll use Scale 2
Performapal Camelump

00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:44.533
and Scale 6
Performapal Lizardraw

00:06:44.533 --> 00:06:46.433
to set the Pendulum
Scale.

00:06:46.433 --> 00:06:49.300
I'm taking control of
this duel starting now!

00:06:56.066 --> 00:06:57.866
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:06:57.866 --> 00:06:59.933
Carve the arc
of victory!

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.033
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.633
Make some magic
Stargazer Magician.

00:07:11.266 --> 00:07:14.400
Scratch your way to victory
Performapal Silver Claw!

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.300
You did it, Yuya,
you Pendulum Summoned!

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.000
Goosepickels!

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.966
Why's Yuya got Stargazer and
Silver Claw in defense mode?

00:07:25.966 --> 00:07:27.533
I don't know.

00:07:27.533 --> 00:07:30.700
Gong's Susanowo has
3800 defense points.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.566
And Yuya knows he doesn't have
a monster that can destroy it.

00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:39.400
So that must be why he summoned
them both in defense mode.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.733
It's a no‐brainer.

00:07:40.733 --> 00:07:43.066
It's making the best
of a bad situation.

00:07:43.066 --> 00:07:45.466
The trouble is Yuya
can't win that way.

00:07:49.166 --> 00:07:52.566
(Yuya)
My best chance of beating
Gong is to summon Rune‐Eyes,

00:07:52.566 --> 00:07:54.533
but I have to find a
new way to summon it

00:07:54.533 --> 00:07:57.600
because I don't have
Polymerization.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.200
I end my turn.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.633
(Tate)
He made his defense stronger
but that's not enough.

00:08:03.633 --> 00:08:05.266
(Zuzu)
This is awful.

00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:06.866
Maybe Yuya should have
held on to this.

00:08:09.566 --> 00:08:10.700
It won't work.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.900
Your defense ain't
strong enough

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.133
to shut Gong down and
you're about to see why.

00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:16.600
My turn!

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.433
Draw!

00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:23.933
First, Gong's summonin'
Superheavy Samurai Soulpiercer.

00:08:25.533 --> 00:08:29.333
Gong equips it on Superheavy
Samurai Warlord Susanowo.

00:08:29.333 --> 00:08:31.400
When Susanowo attacks
your monster,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.033
you still take damage even if
your monster is in defense mode.

00:08:35.033 --> 00:08:36.466
Aw, no way.

00:08:36.466 --> 00:08:38.566
Do it,
Susanowo!

00:08:38.566 --> 00:08:39.733
Attack Silver Claw.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.666
Gong's Susanowo's
got 3800 points.

00:08:44.666 --> 00:08:47.033
Silver Claw's got
700 defense points.

00:08:47.033 --> 00:08:50.433
Which means Yuya takes
3100 points of damage!

00:08:50.433 --> 00:08:52.866
But he's only got
2000 life points left!

00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:58.033
Soulpiercer, fire!

00:09:02.533 --> 00:09:05.100
I activate the Action
Spell Miracle!

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.466
It protects my Silver Claw and
cuts the damage I take in half.

00:09:17.833 --> 00:09:20.433
You're more stubborn
than a mule, buddy.

00:09:20.433 --> 00:09:23.300
Yuya was lucky that time
but his luck's running out.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.133
He only has 450
life points left.

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:28.266
I think it might be
curtains for Yuya,

00:09:28.266 --> 00:09:30.433
unless he's able to sweeten
his hand with this next draw.

00:09:41.533 --> 00:09:44.166
Wow, you really
stepped up your game.

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:45.966
What'd you expect
from Gong?

00:09:45.966 --> 00:09:48.233
Gong said he
wouldn't go easy on you.

00:09:48.233 --> 00:09:49.700
And I'm glad
you didn't.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.166
Because if I'm
gonna go pro,

00:09:51.166 --> 00:09:53.400
I need to be pushed
beyond my limits.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.966
I need to learn to
stretch my imagination,

00:09:55.966 --> 00:09:58.600
believe in myself,
and my deck.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.666
My monsters ready
to swing into action!

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.466
Hip hop to it
Performapal Hip Hippo.

00:10:11.966 --> 00:10:15.166
(Sora)
I hope he's not planning
to run away on that thing.

00:10:15.166 --> 00:10:16.700
I wish you could
stick around

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.433
and hang with us for
a while my pink pal,

00:10:18.433 --> 00:10:20.866
but it's time for
me to turn up the heat.

00:10:20.866 --> 00:10:23.733
I tribute Performapal
Hip Hippo.

00:10:23.733 --> 00:10:26.733
That lets me summon
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:10:35.733 --> 00:10:36.933
Alright.

00:10:36.933 --> 00:10:39.366
The odds are in
Yuya's favor now.

00:10:39.366 --> 00:10:41.733
I don't know about that,
Odd‐Eyes' attack points

00:10:41.733 --> 00:10:45.800
aren't powerful enough to
get past Susanowo's defenses.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.333
There's got to be some
way he can beat Gong.

00:10:48.333 --> 00:10:50.700
(Yuya)
He won't expect this.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.300
I'm activating my Performapal
Lizardraw's Pendulum ability.

00:10:57.133 --> 00:10:59.400
And that means I
get to draw one card

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.166
by returning Lizardraw
to my deck.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.666
Get ready Gong,
'cause it's showtime.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.300
I draw!

00:11:12.366 --> 00:11:13.500
Alright then.

00:11:16.766 --> 00:11:20.966
I use Performapal Trump Witch
to set the Pendulum Scale.

00:11:25.633 --> 00:11:26.933
Who cares?

00:11:26.933 --> 00:11:28.866
Even if you set
the Pendulum Scale again,

00:11:28.866 --> 00:11:31.600
you're not allowed to Pendulum
Summon this turn anymore.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.633
I wasn't planning
to Pendulum Summon.

00:11:33.633 --> 00:11:36.033
I needed Trump Witch's
Pendulum ability.

00:11:36.033 --> 00:11:37.966
She lets me Fusion
Summon a monster

00:11:37.966 --> 00:11:40.033
to my field without
using Polymerization.

00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:47.300
Say what?

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.300
He figured out a
way to Fusion Summon.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.400
Without
Polymerization.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.900
I'm fusing Stargazer Magician
and Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon.

00:11:56.533 --> 00:11:58.233
This is it!

00:11:58.233 --> 00:12:00.766
With the earth shattering
power of this monster,

00:12:00.766 --> 00:12:03.000
victory's
in my sights.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.133
I Fusion Summon

00:12:05.133 --> 00:12:07.500
Rune‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:12:16.633 --> 00:12:19.933
Boy, howdy, when did
Yuya get that upgrade?!

00:12:19.933 --> 00:12:21.733
Alright,
Yuya did it!

00:12:21.733 --> 00:12:24.800
Yuya should call that twist
ending a Confusion Summon.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.733
(giggling)

00:12:26.733 --> 00:12:30.000
I hope he didn't learn to
do that from another school!

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.600
I hate to admit it but
Yuya certainly knows

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.866
how to keep
the surprises coming.

00:12:35.866 --> 00:12:37.400
(Zuzu)
Nice job, Yuya.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.066
Time for this
star to shine.

00:12:43.066 --> 00:12:47.000
Rune‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon,
get set to strike.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.700
I activate Performapal
Camelump's Pendulum ability:

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.800
it takes 800 defense points
away from Susanowo

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.400
and lets Rune‐Eyes deal
damage even if Susanowo's

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.566
in defense mode.

00:13:01.533 --> 00:13:04.066
Rune‐Eyes, attack
with Spiral Skyshot!

00:13:08.933 --> 00:13:12.400
Even though you took Susanowo
down to 3000 defense points,

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.700
you can't destroy it 'cause
Rune‐Eyes's attack points

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:15.966
aren't high enough!

00:13:15.966 --> 00:13:17.300
You sure about that?

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.266
Huh?

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:22.233
When I Fusion Summon
with a Spellcaster,

00:13:22.233 --> 00:13:25.533
Rune‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon
can attack multiple times.

00:13:25.533 --> 00:13:28.200
Since Stargazer
was Level 5,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.066
my Rune‐Eyes is allowed to
attack you three times in a row.

00:13:32.066 --> 00:13:36.200
So get set for
a triple trouncing!

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.966
Each time it attacks,
Camelump's special ability

00:13:38.966 --> 00:13:41.766
lowers Susanowo's
defense points by 800.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.233
(both)
Alright!

00:13:49.233 --> 00:13:51.433
Okay, Rune‐Eyes,
attack again!

00:13:51.433 --> 00:13:54.066
Spiral Skyshot!

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:55.866
Gong's givin'
up 500 life points

00:13:55.866 --> 00:14:00.100
so Susanowo's special ability
can activate the Action Spell...

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.100
Evasion‐‐
That's in your graveyard!

00:14:04.433 --> 00:14:05.933
Your attack
struck out.

00:14:05.933 --> 00:14:07.300
(Yuya)
I'm not through.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.500
Camelump's special ability takes
away 800 more defense points.

00:14:13.233 --> 00:14:14.266
Aw, shucks.

00:14:14.266 --> 00:14:16.466
The third time's
the charm, Rune‐Eyes.

00:14:16.466 --> 00:14:18.266
Spiral Skyshot!

00:14:20.033 --> 00:14:21.933
Mashed potatoes!

00:14:21.933 --> 00:14:23.133
Hooray!

00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:24.566
Susanowo's history!

00:14:24.566 --> 00:14:26.166
Das is wonduhbah.

00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:27.700
Big deal!

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.100
Gong's sendin' Superheavy
Samurai Soulbeads

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.200
to the graveyard to
activate its special ability,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.533
so it summons Susanowo
back in attack mode.

00:14:39.333 --> 00:14:41.400
That's the way
to go, Gong‐baby.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.600
There's no way Yuya
can stop you.

00:14:46.933 --> 00:14:49.166
I feel so bad for Yuya.

00:14:49.166 --> 00:14:51.966
He went to all that trouble
to take out Gong's monster

00:14:51.966 --> 00:14:53.766
and then Gong just
brought it back.

00:14:53.766 --> 00:14:56.766
Yuya's only got
450 life points left.

00:14:56.766 --> 00:14:59.000
This turn's his last
chance to win.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.100
How Yuya can win is
a real head scratcher.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.600
We can't stand still
any longer.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.166
We have to let him know
we're rooting for him.

00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:08.433
But we can't‐‐

00:15:08.433 --> 00:15:10.566
(Yoko)
Don't worry,
he'll be fine.

00:15:10.566 --> 00:15:13.166
Yuya can handle
this on his own.

00:15:13.166 --> 00:15:15.666
He's not going to get stage
fright because we're not there.

00:15:15.666 --> 00:15:19.166
He's in the spotlight, and he's
going to nail this performance.

00:15:19.166 --> 00:15:20.900
You know what
you are to me, Gong?

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.866
You're like a giant wall
that's blocking my way.

00:15:24.866 --> 00:15:28.800
I have to dig deep inside if I'm
going to get through you to win.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.233
(Yuya)
And I have just
the card I need.

00:15:31.233 --> 00:15:32.500
Hopefully.

00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:39.333
Yuya!

00:15:39.333 --> 00:15:41.966
We got your back!

00:15:41.966 --> 00:15:44.566
I wonder what plan Yuya's
got up his sleeve?

00:15:44.566 --> 00:15:46.666
I don't know, but I
sure hope he pulls through.

00:15:58.566 --> 00:15:59.733
It's time...

00:15:59.733 --> 00:16:01.700
Time for me to
swing into action!

00:16:03.966 --> 00:16:05.733
It's too far!

00:16:05.733 --> 00:16:07.200
No, Yuya!

00:16:29.733 --> 00:16:30.966
Bingo.

00:16:33.633 --> 00:16:38.000
That boy really knows
how to steal the spotlight.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.833
(Yuya)
Alright.

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:42.533
I send the Action Spell Over
Sword to the graveyard

00:16:42.533 --> 00:16:44.733
to activate
the trap card Danger Draw.

00:16:48.766 --> 00:16:50.633
Right, this
is all or nothing.

00:16:50.633 --> 00:16:52.366
I get to draw
one card.

00:16:52.366 --> 00:16:55.866
But if the that card I draw
happens to be a monster card,

00:16:55.866 --> 00:16:58.100
I take damage equal to
its attack points.

00:16:59.733 --> 00:17:02.533
Are you serious?!

00:17:02.533 --> 00:17:04.066
(Sora)
If Yuya draws a
monster card

00:17:04.066 --> 00:17:06.833
with 450 attack
points or more...

00:17:06.833 --> 00:17:08.333
(Tate)
Yuya automatically
loses.

00:17:11.933 --> 00:17:16.200
It's amazing how much Yuya's
style reminds me of his father.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.233
Yusho always kept the audience
on the edge of their seat

00:17:19.233 --> 00:17:20.966
waiting to see what
was going to happen next.

00:17:25.933 --> 00:17:27.466
(Yuya)
This is all or nothing.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.633
I draw.

00:17:34.933 --> 00:17:36.266
I did it.

00:17:36.266 --> 00:17:38.766
I got just the spell
card I needed.

00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:41.033
I activate Big Return!

00:17:41.033 --> 00:17:43.166
This spell lets me use
my monster's ability

00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:45.133
for a second time.

00:17:45.133 --> 00:17:48.833
I activate Trump witch's special
ability to Fusion Summon again.

00:17:52.566 --> 00:17:55.100
I'm fusing
Performapal Silver Claw

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.400
and Rune‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.666
Oh, no!

00:17:58.666 --> 00:17:59.733
I can't believe it.

00:17:59.733 --> 00:18:02.000
A second Fusion.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.233
I'm taking Fusion Summoning
to a whole new level.

00:18:05.233 --> 00:18:07.400
Merge into one.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.666
Look to the skies
and feast your eyes

00:18:09.666 --> 00:18:12.666
on Beast‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.533
(gasping, chuckling)

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.066
Beast‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon,

00:18:32.066 --> 00:18:35.800
attack Superheavy Samurai
Warlord Susanowo!

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.733
Blazing Spiral Storm!

00:18:45.866 --> 00:18:49.800
Beast‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon's
special ability activates.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.900
Since I used
Performapal Silver Claw

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.100
to Fusion summon Beast‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon, you take damage

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.700
equal to Performapal Silver
Claw's attack points.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.500
Silver Claw has
1800 attack points.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.700
Sorry, pal.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.400
This is
the end, Gong!

00:19:21.966 --> 00:19:22.466
))(Tate, Frederick, Allie)
Alright, Yuya.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.833
Hey, you're here.

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:27.933
That was awesome.

00:19:27.933 --> 00:19:29.166
You're amazing, Yuya.

00:19:29.166 --> 00:19:30.866
(Frederick)
You make me want
to dance.

00:19:30.866 --> 00:19:32.333
You were watching
all this time?

00:19:32.333 --> 00:19:34.233
Sure, we watched
the whole duel

00:19:34.233 --> 00:19:35.733
only we couldn't
let you know it.

00:19:35.733 --> 00:19:37.800
'Cause Nico didn't
want you to know.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.333
If you're going to follow
in your dad's footsteps,

00:19:40.333 --> 00:19:43.033
sometimes you have to be
your own biggest fan.

00:19:43.033 --> 00:19:44.833
Guess you're right.

00:19:44.833 --> 00:19:46.833
You totally did it!

00:19:46.833 --> 00:19:48.333
I'm all fired up!

00:19:48.333 --> 00:19:50.033
Yuya the man!

00:19:50.033 --> 00:19:53.366
Even I have to admit using
a Pendulum special ability

00:19:53.366 --> 00:19:56.100
to Fusion Summon
was a pretty sweet move.

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.066
Very sweet, that
move, I mean.

00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:01.666
(Yuya)
I get it,
they were all here for me.

00:20:01.666 --> 00:20:03.133
I just didn't
know it.

00:20:06.366 --> 00:20:07.933
Gong, I...

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.433
I'm glad that I
won but... for you,

00:20:13.433 --> 00:20:16.266
the Junior Arc League
Championship isn't gonna happen.

00:20:16.266 --> 00:20:17.566
Gong ain't
licked yet.

00:20:17.566 --> 00:20:19.200
There's still
a week to go.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.466
Gong's still
got a shot.

00:20:21.466 --> 00:20:24.500
Gong's happy Gong got to
battle without holdin' back.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.933
Next time things'll
be different.

00:20:26.933 --> 00:20:28.600
That's a promise, pal.

00:20:32.033 --> 00:20:33.266
(crying)

00:20:33.266 --> 00:20:34.833
Friendship is such
a beautiful thing!

00:20:34.833 --> 00:20:36.466
It's so amazing!

00:20:36.466 --> 00:20:38.366
Okay, that's
enough, Dad!

00:20:38.366 --> 00:20:40.733
My son, you are a wonderful
and special person,

00:20:40.733 --> 00:20:42.200
even if you
are a loser.

00:20:44.866 --> 00:20:46.433
(Nico Smiley)
Well done, Yuya.

00:20:46.433 --> 00:20:48.500
You've proven to be an
exceptional duelist

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.866
once again,
as I expected.

00:20:50.866 --> 00:20:52.500
You're one step
closer to becoming

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.300
a first‐rate professional,

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.366
and that's just what
you want and I need.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.600
(Gong)
My friend.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.300
(Claude)
It's confirmed.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.566
Yuya Sakaki has qualified

00:21:04.566 --> 00:21:05.900
for the Junior Arc League
Championship.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.300
(Declan)
Good.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.200
Now all the duelists I wanted
to qualify are participating.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.600
Yes, sir.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.966
And regarding the
Leo Institute students,

00:21:13.966 --> 00:21:16.833
Julia Krystal, Kit Blade
and Dipper O'Rion...

00:21:16.833 --> 00:21:19.333
Were you able to
accomplish what I requested?

00:21:19.333 --> 00:21:20.600
Yes.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.200
The procedure we performed
was a complete success.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.500
Those three won't remember who
Shay is or anything that he did.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.800
Good.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.566
Now Shay will be
able to participate

00:21:29.566 --> 00:21:32.866
in the championship
with a clean slate.

00:21:32.866 --> 00:21:35.166
And we'll find out exactly
what he's capable of.

00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:44.533
And the same
with them.

00:21:44.533 --> 00:21:46.800
We'll see which
duelists are worthy

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.966
to fight for the future
of our world.
