WEBVTT

00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:04.100
(Yuya)
Previously
on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V."

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.833
(Zuzu)
Iggy was runner up last year,

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:07.733
and this year he looks even
tougher.

00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.600
Here we go!

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.066
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:16.866
I Fusion Summon
Idaten, the Conqueror Star.

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.566
(Iggy)
Attack Beast‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon.

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:23.333
The path of darkness is the only
possible road to victory.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.233
Uhh!

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.100
I Xyz Summon

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.900
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.766
(Shay, thinking)
How does he have
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon?

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:54.633
That monster belongs to Yuto,
not him.

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:56.166
Show no mercy.

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:59.900
Decimate Idaten, the Conqueror
Star!

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.633
Mauling Mandible Charge.

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:04.600
Aah!

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:10.833
(Nico Smiley) The
winner is Yuya Sakaki.

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:12.800
Yuya is seeming scary.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.133
Yeah, something's off.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.600
I may have won,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.200
but why do I feel
like I lost?

(Nico Smiley)
Today's first two Junior
Division duels

00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:27.833
were off‐the‐chart insane,
and our next duel...

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:31.700
How did Yuya get a hold
of Yuto's card?

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.533
(Declan)
Where do you think you're going?

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:35.166
(Shay)
To confront Yuya.

00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:36.666
This isn't the time.

00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:39.433
Let me be crystal clear.

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:41.900
You will take no actions that
could interfere

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.533
with the ARC League
Championship.

00:02:43.533 --> 00:02:47.166
My plan has been implemented
after a significant outlay

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:49.200
of time, money, and effort.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.133
I will not allow you to place
that plan in jeopardy.

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:55.633
Is that understood?

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:04.300
I'll have one of our guards
keep an eye on him
just in case.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.233
(Nico Smiley)
Hold the phone, we have
breaking tournament news.

00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:11.066
Today's third duel has been
decided before it even
began.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:14.533
The duelist, Dipper O'Rion,
representing the Leo
Institute,

00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:16.466
failed to appear
for his bout

00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:18.466
against the king of the
kitchen, Reed Pepper,

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:21.066
which means that Pepper wins
by default!

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:23.100
Dipper didn't show up?

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.733
Mr. President, three hours ago,
we detected an energy burst.

00:03:26.733 --> 00:03:28.733
It appears someone in the city

00:03:28.733 --> 00:03:30.733
carried out a highly‐powerful
summon.

00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:32.700
Using which method?

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.666
Fusion, sir.

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:37.366
After pinpointing the area where
the summon occurred,

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:39.766
we obtained this footage
from a security cam.

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:40.966
(Claude)
Dipper.

00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:43.333
(Declan)
And it appears he's not alone.

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:53.933
Replay the footage.

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.033
(Chief)
Yes, sir.

00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:56.966
Stop there and magnify.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.600
(gasps)
I know her.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.166
That's Zuzu Boyle from
the You Show School.

00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:09.233
Folks, welcome back to the
ARC League Championship.

00:04:09.233 --> 00:04:12.466
As our competition continues,
Zuzu Boyle,

00:04:12.466 --> 00:04:14.933
the feisty Fusion duelist,
will tussle with

00:04:14.933 --> 00:04:17.666
Micky Starlett,
the princess of pop

00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:18.733
whose number one
on the charts

00:04:18.733 --> 00:04:21.133
and looking to be number one
on the battlefield!

00:04:21.133 --> 00:04:23.166
Go, Zuzu, go!

00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:25.233
Win another for You Show!

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:29.366
Best of luck!

00:04:29.366 --> 00:04:31.633
Prove zat you are
a Fusion meister.

00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:33.233
Hang tough, Zuzu.

00:04:33.233 --> 00:04:36.200
(stadium fans)
We love you, Micky.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.566
(all chanting)
We want Micky! We want Mickey!

00:04:39.566 --> 00:04:43.066
(Micky)
Sorry, I'm late, but I had so
many autographs to sign.

00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:44.600
Let's bring it in Team Micky.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.333
(all)
You're the best Micky.

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:49.900
Lead Team Micky to victory!

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.600
(fan)
You're amazing.
(fan)
Love you!

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.500
And I love you!

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.433
I have all your albums.
We love you, Micky.

00:05:04.433 --> 00:05:06.266
First I want to thank
all my fans

00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:07.900
for coming out
and supporting me.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.200
You're the best!

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.100
I want to dedicate this duel
to each one of you.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.066
(cheering)

00:05:15.066 --> 00:05:17.966
Micky sure knows how
to work a crowd.

00:05:17.966 --> 00:05:20.733
She has them practically eating
out of her hand.

00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:24.466
But before this duel is over,
I'll win them over to my side.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.533
(Operator A)
Sir, we've located the young
girl who attacked Dipper.

00:05:29.533 --> 00:05:30.933
<i>She's at Duel Court One.</i>

00:05:30.933 --> 00:05:33.266
(Operator B)
We've also confirmed
that Zuzu Boyle

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:36.300
is scheduled to battle right
now on Duel Court Two.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.366
How can Zuzu be in
two places at once?

00:05:39.366 --> 00:05:42.166
Last year's Junior Division
winner, Kev Ravenwood,

00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:44.100
is dueling
at Duel Court One.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.366
That's the duel
she's watching.

00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:49.700
Then it appears that Ravenwood
is her next target.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.300
Sir?

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.800
I'm going to
the arena.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.033
I don't want Shay anywhere
near there, understood?

00:05:58.033 --> 00:05:59.666
Certainly.

00:05:59.666 --> 00:06:03.733
(Nico Smiley)Here's "hula
hoping" the action we're
watching doesn't let up.

00:06:03.733 --> 00:06:06.233
You don't have to worry about
that happening.

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:09.133
Gellenduo, crush that Diva.

00:06:11.833 --> 00:06:15.100
Since I have a heart,
I'll end my turn.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.366
<i>Whoa, what a nail‐biter!</i>

00:06:17.366 --> 00:06:20.700
Believe me, duel's don't get
any closer than this.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.800
If this were a popularity
contest, I'd win by a landslide.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.033
With star power
and tons of fans on my side.

00:06:28.033 --> 00:06:31.466
What do you say?
Can we beat Zuzu together?

00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:32.700
Totally!
(cheering)

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.600
Two can play
at that game, Micky.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.133
You're all the rage now,

00:06:36.133 --> 00:06:38.766
but I'll use my
dueltaining skills to
tilt the crowd my way.

00:06:38.766 --> 00:06:40.900
Don't let 'er
get to you, Zuzu.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.733
I'm as fired up as 5,000 fans,
and they're all pulling for you!

00:06:44.733 --> 00:06:47.466
Don't forget Gong's
in your corner, too.

00:06:47.466 --> 00:06:50.200
Gong can get rowdier
than all those Starlett fans
put together.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.366
(both)
'Cause nothing
can top...

00:06:52.366 --> 00:06:54.500
the power of Zuzu Boyle!

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.666
Yay!
Yay!

00:06:55.666 --> 00:06:58.133
Yay.

00:06:58.133 --> 00:07:03.200
(thinking)
I'm still not sure what
went on in my last duel.

00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:07.100
I barely remember what
happened...

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.400
but winning never felt so wrong
before.

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:16.833
(female announcer)
This duel was decided by
a perfectly timed Xyz Summon.

00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:21.400
Kev Ravenwood used his skills
to "X" out the competition.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.733
(Kev Ravenwood)
Hey, backstage is only
for competitors

00:07:31.733 --> 00:07:33.466
still in the
tournament.

00:07:34.966 --> 00:07:38.266
Correct you are,
Ravenwood.

00:07:43.033 --> 00:07:46.100
Declan?

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.133
You may leave now, Ravenwood.

00:07:49.133 --> 00:07:50.266
But...

00:07:50.266 --> 00:07:52.733
The way you won today
was quite impressive.

00:07:52.733 --> 00:07:54.866
I look forward
to your next match.

00:07:54.866 --> 00:07:57.233
You won't be disappointed.

00:07:57.233 --> 00:08:00.633
Don't move!

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.266
Lay off.

00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:05.266
(Declan)
Get going now.

00:08:08.766 --> 00:08:09.866
Get out of my way.

00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:11.633
Just who do you
think you are?

00:08:11.633 --> 00:08:13.800
(Barrett)
Let me take care of him.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.366
I'll handle this, Barrett.

00:08:18.366 --> 00:08:21.466
No, the Professor gave me orders
to keep an eye on you.

00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:24.433
He said if any flies get in your
way, I should swat 'em down.

00:08:27.633 --> 00:08:31.366
Is the Professor you just
referred to named Leo Akaba?

00:08:33.433 --> 00:08:39.266
Then it seems we have a lot more
in common than you realize.

00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:47.400
Seal this area off.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.900
No one is to leave or enter
till I contact you.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.033
(Operator A)
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

00:08:57.333 --> 00:08:59.333
(both)
Let's duel.

00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:01.466
I have one directive,
to protect,

00:09:01.466 --> 00:09:03.133
and that's what I will do.

00:09:03.133 --> 00:09:06.733
I now activate the spell card
Beastborg Fusioner.

00:09:06.733 --> 00:09:08.633
This spell gives me the power

00:09:08.633 --> 00:09:11.633
to Fusion Summon
a Beastborg Monster.

00:09:11.633 --> 00:09:14.700
Fusion, just as I expected.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.833
I'm fusing my Panther Warrior
and Dark Sentinel.

00:09:17.833 --> 00:09:20.266
They'll form your worst
nightmare.

00:09:20.266 --> 00:09:23.366
My new monster will mix the
savagery of a jungle hunter

00:09:23.366 --> 00:09:26.766
with the attack strength of
a high‐tech combat machine.

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:31.666
I Fusion Summon the most
dangerous mercenary
you ever faced.

00:09:31.666 --> 00:09:35.566
Beastborg Panther Predator!

00:09:37.366 --> 00:09:39.533
(Chief)
This matches the signal we
picked up yesterday.

00:09:39.533 --> 00:09:41.533
Run a full analysis.

00:09:41.533 --> 00:09:45.000
(Barrett)
Panther Predator's special
ability activates.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.833
So you take damage equal to half
its attack points.

00:09:47.833 --> 00:09:49.133
Quasar Beam!

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.366
Now go ahead
and take your turn.

00:09:55.366 --> 00:09:56.800
Show me what you're made of.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.833
Barrett's dueling is about as
subtle as a freight train.

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:02.733
But I must admit,
he gets results.

00:10:02.733 --> 00:10:05.900
(Claude)
Mr. President,
our analysis is complete.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.700
Your opponent is definitely
a duelist from the Fusion
Dimension.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.466
Yes, I'm aware of that.

00:10:10.466 --> 00:10:13.766
But I need
to find out much more.

00:10:13.766 --> 00:10:15.966
To start,
I'll activate a spell.

00:10:15.966 --> 00:10:18.100
Dark Contract
with the Swamp King.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.833
And with it,
at the beginning of
my next turn.

00:10:20.833 --> 00:10:23.700
This spell card will deal me
1,000 points of damage.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.166
Huh?

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:26.533
So then what would be
the advantage?

00:10:26.533 --> 00:10:30.666
Although, it will exact a heavy
price as this duel continues,

00:10:30.666 --> 00:10:34.333
I can summon a Fusion monster
without using a Fusion spell.

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:39.000
Watch now as I fuse Double D
Cerberus and Double D Lilith.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.233
(gasps)

00:10:40.233 --> 00:10:42.733
I hope a bodyguard
such as yourself

00:10:42.733 --> 00:10:45.400
is prepared for any and all
situations

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.833
because this duel is about to
get very interesting.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.500
I Fusion Summon.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.200
Come forth and conquer all
Triple D Flame King Genghis.

00:11:00.766 --> 00:11:01.833
Now attack.

00:11:01.833 --> 00:11:04.033
Flame King Genghis,
take out

00:11:04.033 --> 00:11:07.633
Panther Predator with
Scorching Sword Swipe.

00:11:13.333 --> 00:11:15.600
Clever, but I'll turn that
tactical maneuver

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.533
to my advantage using this.

00:11:17.533 --> 00:11:20.600
I play the trap Beastborg
Medal of the Shield!

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.100
For every 100 points
of damage I take,

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.233
my Shield
is awarded one medal.

00:11:25.233 --> 00:11:28.333
Since I lost 400,
I gain four medals.

00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:30.966
And even though you destroyed
Panther Predator,

00:11:30.966 --> 00:11:33.133
I can still harness its
special ability

00:11:33.133 --> 00:11:35.433
to bring back the monsters that
were used to summon it.

00:11:36.866 --> 00:11:38.800
Panther Warrior
and Dark Sentinel

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.766
are back on the front line.

00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:44.766
I see that you have the skills
of battle‐tested soldier.

00:11:44.766 --> 00:11:46.366
This should be interesting.

00:11:56.133 --> 00:11:59.166
Only a soldier could duel
the way you do, Barrett.

00:11:59.166 --> 00:12:04.266
It's evident to me that
you've seen your share
of actual combat.

00:12:12.533 --> 00:12:15.033
It's a trip.
Look out!

00:12:15.033 --> 00:12:16.800
(explosion)

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.233
Like I told everyone else
a billion times,

00:12:19.233 --> 00:12:21.633
I've decided to go to the
Standard Dimension.

00:12:21.633 --> 00:12:23.700
There's nothing you can do
to stop me.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.566
That never crossed my mind.

00:12:26.566 --> 00:12:28.400
I'm going with you, Celina.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.100
All the babysitters I had
in the past always said no.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.633
But you wanna tag along?

00:12:33.633 --> 00:12:36.533
(thinking)
I need to prove to myself
I can still fight.

00:12:36.533 --> 00:12:39.600
Otherwise, I may never step onto
a battlefield again.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.200
It's time to put the past
in the past.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.366
It's my move!

00:12:44.366 --> 00:12:48.800
I activate Beastborg Fusioner!

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.533
I fuse Panther Warrior and Dark
Sentinel once again!

00:12:53.533 --> 00:12:57.433
And now my Panther Predator's
ready for combat.

00:12:57.433 --> 00:12:59.966
And I'm going to get it
primed for attack

00:12:59.966 --> 00:13:03.433
by activating the trap
Beastborg Medal of the Shield.

00:13:03.433 --> 00:13:07.100
By sending it to the graveyard,
it pumps up Panther Predator's

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.233
attack points by 100 for
every medal on the shield.

00:13:14.266 --> 00:13:16.733
And to further my tactical
advantage,

00:13:16.733 --> 00:13:20.066
I'll activate the trap
Beastborg Medal of the Blade.

00:13:20.066 --> 00:13:22.233
For every hundred points of
damage that you take,

00:13:22.233 --> 00:13:25.133
my trap will be rewarded
with one medal.

00:13:25.133 --> 00:13:27.766
It would appear that you
enjoy collecting medals.

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:29.900
I have earned my share.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.833
I take immense pride
in being a capable soldier.

00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:35.533
But, mostly, my Beastborg
and I take pride

00:13:35.533 --> 00:13:37.366
in wiping out our opponents!

00:13:37.366 --> 00:13:39.866
Panther Predator, Quasar Beam!

00:13:44.466 --> 00:13:48.600
Well done, soldier,
but I think we need to
power you up even more.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.666
By sending Beastborg Medal of
The Blade to the graveyard,

00:13:51.666 --> 00:13:54.366
you gain 100 attack points
for each of its medals

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:57.033
for a total of 1,000 attack
points.

00:13:57.033 --> 00:13:58.533
Now it's got 3,000.

00:13:58.533 --> 00:13:59.800
Declan's in trouble.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.933
That Panther can extinguish
his Flame King.

00:14:01.933 --> 00:14:04.900
Panther, engage the enemy.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.633
Cyber Panther Slash!

00:14:07.633 --> 00:14:08.800
(roars)

00:14:14.366 --> 00:14:16.666
(thinking)
Barrett's no ordinary soldier.

00:14:16.666 --> 00:14:19.733
He has "special forces"
written all over him.

00:14:19.733 --> 00:14:23.900
I'd make the most of this next
turn, it will be your last.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.266
And don't forget,

00:14:25.266 --> 00:14:28.833
your Contract with the Swamp
King is still in effect.

00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:31.633
The moment you draw your card
to start your turn,

00:14:31.633 --> 00:14:35.366
its effect will weaken you
by a thousand life points.

00:14:35.366 --> 00:14:36.866
I'm well aware of that.

00:14:36.866 --> 00:14:40.200
You believe you have
the advantage now,

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.066
but the tide of battle can
always turn... and it shall.

00:14:46.033 --> 00:14:48.166
As you so thoughtfully
pointed out,

00:14:48.166 --> 00:14:50.466
my Contract spell
has now come due,

00:14:50.466 --> 00:14:53.200
and it will cost me
1,000 life points.

00:14:57.366 --> 00:14:59.233
Your willingness
to take damage

00:14:59.233 --> 00:15:01.500
makes you worthy of
one of my medals.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.433
I appreciate the offer.

00:15:04.433 --> 00:15:07.733
But the only award I care about
is complete victory over you,

00:15:07.733 --> 00:15:09.666
and I'm going to win that
right now.

00:15:09.666 --> 00:15:10.800
How's that?

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.666
Allow me to demonstrate.

00:15:15.466 --> 00:15:17.533
First, I'll set
the Pendulum Scale

00:15:17.533 --> 00:15:20.733
with Scale One Double D
Savant Kepler

00:15:20.733 --> 00:15:23.533
and Scale 11 Double D
Savant Galilei.

00:15:23.533 --> 00:15:26.533
Behold as they now work
their wizardry.

00:15:26.533 --> 00:15:28.966
You won't believe your eyes.

00:15:35.466 --> 00:15:38.333
I can now summon monsters from
Level two through nine

00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:39.700
at the same time.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.466
The energy of the universe

00:15:41.466 --> 00:15:44.633
swings between the forces of
darkness and of light.

00:15:44.633 --> 00:15:48.166
I shall now harness the power of
this eternal oscillation.

00:15:48.166 --> 00:15:53.166
I Pendulum Summon and call upon
my two monsters to emerge.

00:15:53.166 --> 00:15:57.566
First, the majestic warrior
Double D Proud Chevalier!

00:15:57.566 --> 00:16:00.966
And then the vessel that locks
away the forces of chaos,

00:16:00.966 --> 00:16:03.466
Double D Pandora!

00:16:03.466 --> 00:16:05.800
What's a Pendulum Summon?
How'd you do that?

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.566
Quite easily.

00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:11.233
For my final step,
I overlay both monsters

00:16:11.233 --> 00:16:14.100
in order to build
the Overlay Network.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.733
When this duel started,
you expected to steamroll me
into submission.

00:16:17.733 --> 00:16:19.966
Little did you realize
the war you waged

00:16:19.966 --> 00:16:21.400
was one you could never win.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.300
I now Xyz Summon.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.433
Triple D Marksman King Tell.

00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:32.066
I'll use its special ability.

00:16:32.066 --> 00:16:34.233
When I take damage
from a Contract

00:16:34.233 --> 00:16:36.633
by using one Overlay Unit,

00:16:36.633 --> 00:16:39.666
not only will your Monster
lose 1,000 attack points,

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:43.266
you'll also suffer
1,000 points of damage.

00:16:43.266 --> 00:16:45.566
So you made that Contract

00:16:45.566 --> 00:16:47.433
knowing that it would
hurt me instead.

00:16:47.433 --> 00:16:48.733
Electrostatic Arrow.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.633
Aah!

00:17:00.733 --> 00:17:04.100
(Declan)
And since I still have one
Overlay Unit remaining,

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.200
I'll use that, too.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.800
Electrostatic Arrow!

00:17:16.566 --> 00:17:18.800
Ready for more surprises?

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.966
As it happens, my Contract
has another effect.

00:17:21.966 --> 00:17:24.366
By banishing monsters from my
graveyard,

00:17:24.366 --> 00:17:26.533
I can summon another
Fusion Monster

00:17:26.533 --> 00:17:28.866
without using a fusion
spell.

00:17:28.866 --> 00:17:30.000
Another one?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.633
By banishing Proud Chevalier
and Pandora,

00:17:32.633 --> 00:17:35.966
I will create a monster that
will seal your fate.

00:17:35.966 --> 00:17:37.666
I Fusion Summon.

00:17:37.666 --> 00:17:39.533
Cast your eyes upon
the winged fiend

00:17:39.533 --> 00:17:41.533
destined to defeat your
Beastborg.

00:17:41.533 --> 00:17:44.000
Triple D Oracle King d'Arc.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.500
Now take flight and wipe out
his Beastborg.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.600
Strike the final blow.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.233
Not gonna happen.

00:17:52.233 --> 00:17:55.833
I activate my trap card
Beastborg Medal of Honor.

00:17:55.833 --> 00:17:58.866
By destroying my Panther
Predator, I can summon

00:17:58.866 --> 00:18:02.366
the two monsters that were fused
together to create it.

00:18:02.366 --> 00:18:05.266
Panther Predator,
you served me well.

00:18:05.266 --> 00:18:06.700
By giving one up for the team,

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.300
you let me bring back Panther
Warrior and Dark Sentinel.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.766
Medal of Honor
has another effect.

00:18:12.766 --> 00:18:15.200
One that's gonna be
a real game changer.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.766
We both take damage equal to my
monsters' total attack points.

00:18:23.233 --> 00:18:25.766
I won't survive the damage,
but neither will you.

00:18:25.766 --> 00:18:29.433
We're going down together!

00:18:33.266 --> 00:18:35.466
(Barrett)
We're going down together!

00:18:36.766 --> 00:18:38.800
A bold move,
but it won't work.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.600
I activate Triple D Oracle King
d'Arc's special ability.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.100
Instead of taking damage,

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.933
I gain life points equal to that
amount instead.

00:18:47.933 --> 00:18:50.266
Existential Escalation.

00:18:50.266 --> 00:18:54.233
Now that I feel rejuvenated,
I can finish what I started.

00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:55.700
No!

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.400
Our battle resumes.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.666
Oracle King, attack!

00:18:58.666 --> 00:19:01.966
Imperial Onslaught.

00:19:08.566 --> 00:19:09.966
One last attack.

00:19:09.966 --> 00:19:13.900
King Tell, take aim
at Dark Sentinel.

00:19:16.166 --> 00:19:17.866
Ionic Arrow Strike.

00:19:34.066 --> 00:19:37.433
(Nico Smiley)
Zuzu Boyle put up a valiant
struggle this afternoon,

00:19:37.433 --> 00:19:40.700
but it looks like her duel
withMicky Starlett is all but
over.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.700
We'll see about that.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.666
(thinking) As long as I have
a single life point left,

00:19:44.666 --> 00:19:46.166
there's still a chance.

00:19:46.166 --> 00:19:49.266
I'll show this crowd what it
means to win the You Show way.

00:19:49.266 --> 00:19:53.266
I draw!

00:19:55.333 --> 00:19:58.733
Crystal Rose, this is
your moment to shine.

00:19:58.733 --> 00:20:01.000
And I can treat this Rose
like another monster,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.100
so it will be standing
in for Mozarta.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.666
That's flower power.
Go, Zuzu!

00:20:10.633 --> 00:20:13.733
(Yuto)
Keep the world entertained
and smiling.

00:20:13.733 --> 00:20:15.766
Ladies, merge your voices.

00:20:15.766 --> 00:20:17.800
Together you'll sing a
sensational duet

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.000
that will form an even more
melodious monster.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.700
I Fusion Summon...

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.300
Bloom Diva,
the Melodious Choir!

00:20:34.466 --> 00:20:37.666
Spectacular.
What a gorgeous Monster.

00:20:37.666 --> 00:20:41.833
(thinking)
They seem so happy, and all that
because of Zuzu.

00:20:41.833 --> 00:20:43.400
I gotta get back to dueltaining

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.133
like I know I can and make
the world smile.

00:20:46.133 --> 00:20:48.533
Time to face the music, Micky.

00:20:48.533 --> 00:20:50.600
Bloom Diva, belt one out.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.666
Attack Wingweaver.

00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:54.400
Wrecking Refrain.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.800
Aah! But what
about my encore?

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.033
(Nico Smiley)
<i>Well, trim my sideburns.</i>

00:21:01.033 --> 00:21:02.700
I was ready to give Zuzu
the hook,

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.333
but she went diva
and stole the duel.

00:21:05.333 --> 00:21:07.333
She's the comeback queen
of our tournament.

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:09.800
Yay, for Zuzu!

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.933
That was so... dueltaining.

00:21:18.366 --> 00:21:20.333
(chuckling)

00:21:24.433 --> 00:21:27.466
(Barrett groaning)

00:21:27.466 --> 00:21:29.233
Don't be leaving so soon.

00:21:29.233 --> 00:21:32.200
I have a tale that
you might want to hear

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.533
that will change everything
you believe in.
