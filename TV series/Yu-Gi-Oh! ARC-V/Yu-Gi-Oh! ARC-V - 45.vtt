WEBVTT

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.900
Previously
on "YuGiOh Arc‐V"...

00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.500
Who are they?

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.400
They're not supposed
to be in the tournament.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.966
We are Obelisk Force.

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.833
That's Sora!

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:16.233
You again...

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:18.800
The two of us
have unfinished business, Shay,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.400
but now I can finally settle
the score once and for all!

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.533
(Zuzu)
I never like
losing a duel.

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.800
but it was
definitely fun.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.066
Agreed.

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.633
But as fun
as it was,

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:32.700
our rematch will be
even more amazing!

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.033
There isn't going
to be any rematch!

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:39.066
That's because this next duel
will be your last!

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.500
Huh?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.666
I didn't know
you had a twin!

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.766
She does look
just like me!

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.433
Could she be Lulu?

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:53.633
We just cut the public feed for
the Volcano Zone, Mr. President.

00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:56.466
The time for action
has finally arrived.

00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:59.233
You candidates have shown great
promise and potential.

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:02.266
It's time to prove you have
what it takes to become Lancers.

00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:07.133
(grunting, groaning)

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.000
Got 'em.

00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:15.900
No!

00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.533
Stop it!

(nervous laugh)

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.800
Well, it looks like
those pesky gremlins

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.900
are still wreaking
havoc with our live feeds

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.200
from the Ancient Ruins and
Volcano Zones.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.600
But if
you're a foodie like me,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.733
you're gonna love the
gastronomical surprises

00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:40.900
awaiting you
in the Jungle Zone!

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.000
(man)
Food schmood!

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.500
As long as they
show Reed Pepper,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.800
those other feeds can
stay out of order!

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.133
Seriously?

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:51.400
(girls cheering)
Who's number one?

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.500
Go, Reed, go!

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.433
Pepper!
You rock!

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.100
If they won't show Yuya, then
I'm turning off the tube!

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.600
I know what to do!

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.100
I'll use
magic!

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.966
Or even better...

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:06.000
Instead of viewing him
from here,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.866
I'll support
my duelmate Yuya in person.

00:03:17.933 --> 00:03:20.933
Now, my gourmet monsters
and I

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:24.133
are ready to embark on our
culinary crusade!

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:25.966
We hope you enjoy!

00:03:25.966 --> 00:03:28.433
Cook up
a spicy attack!

00:03:28.433 --> 00:03:31.700
And pour on
plenty of Pepper!

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.400
Yo, I'm watching
a duel here, chum!

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.266
Why don't you make like
a boat and sail on outta here?

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:39.966
Even better, why don't you
get off your tailbone

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:41.800
and get set
to duel?

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.033
Gong's
challenging you, lazybones!

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:47.033
You and Gong are gonna go
monster to monster!

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:48.800
Now stand up
and fight!

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.200
I'd rather not.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.566
Excuse Gong?

00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:54.466
The only way I'll even think of
dueling you is if you agree

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:56.666
to
put up five Pendulum cards.

00:03:56.666 --> 00:03:58.233
Huh?

00:03:58.233 --> 00:04:01.633
I have a real bad feeling this
guy's planning something
fishy.

00:04:01.633 --> 00:04:03.566
Gong could get
totally played.

00:04:03.566 --> 00:04:06.200
Trout's a real
card shark.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.133
I wish we could see
how Yuya's doing.

00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:11.166
And what's the deal
with Dennis and Zuzu?

00:04:14.466 --> 00:04:15.833
(gasps)

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:22.066
Are you gonna
introduce me...

00:04:22.066 --> 00:04:24.400
to your twin sister?

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.133
You must be Lulu.
I'm Zuzu.

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:31.000
I don't care who you are, I
have business with this Xyz
fugitive.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.666
Xyz fugitive?
Huh?

00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:35.566
Um, heh,
what is that?

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:37.300
Don't play dumb!

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.266
I'm taking you down!

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:40.566
Arm yourself!

00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:44.000
Hey, take it easy,
Lulu!

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.666
I don't know how you do things
in the Xyz Dimension,

00:04:46.666 --> 00:04:49.933
but in our world, we don't just
go around attacking each other.

00:04:49.933 --> 00:04:50.866
Leave Dennis al‐‐

00:04:50.866 --> 00:04:53.033
It's perfectly
alright, Zuzu.

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:54.366
Huh?

00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:57.600
This girl is clearly all mixed
up about me‐‐ However!

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.100
A dueltainer
always accepts a challenge

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.000
to keep the crowd
entertained!

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.500
Don't you agree?

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.566
Uh, no.

00:05:06.566 --> 00:05:10.366
I think the tournament
is a lot more important.

00:05:10.366 --> 00:05:11.866
Okay,
Zuzu Number 2.

00:05:11.866 --> 00:05:13.866
I accept
your challenge!

00:05:13.866 --> 00:05:15.100
We'll have
to make this quick,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.333
but let's not leave out
any razzle‐dazzle!

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:20.133
Let's duel!

00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:22.366
I'll go first.

00:05:22.366 --> 00:05:27.166
And I'll start by activating
the spell Polymerization!

00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:28.966
She's a
Fusion Summoner?

00:05:28.966 --> 00:05:33.700
I fuse Lunalight Blue Cat with
Lunalight Purple Butterfly!

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.433
By combining the reflexes
of a fierce feline

00:05:38.433 --> 00:05:41.100
with the fluttering fury
of a nighttime huntress,

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.233
I can create
a new lunar legend!

00:05:46.766 --> 00:05:49.166
I Fusion Summon!

00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:53.533
Lunalight
Cat Dancer!

00:05:53.533 --> 00:05:55.700
This duel'll be
the cat's meow!

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.433
(alarm blaring)

00:05:57.433 --> 00:05:59.166
Our sensors have detected
a high‐level summon

00:05:59.166 --> 00:06:00.933
in the
Volcano Zone!

00:06:00.933 --> 00:06:02.800
The signature is even more
powerful than the one

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.166
that we
spotted in the Iceberg Zone.

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:09.366
Shay's sister Lulu is from the
Xyz Dimension

00:06:09.366 --> 00:06:12.633
So that means she would never
Fusion Summon like this girl.

00:06:12.633 --> 00:06:15.000
That must mean she's not Lulu.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.100
So then who is she?

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.533
I'll finish up by playing a
facedown.

00:06:21.533 --> 00:06:23.400
Your move, Xyzian!

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.300
(laughing wickedly)

00:06:38.466 --> 00:06:40.000
Oh!

00:06:43.366 --> 00:06:46.033
Harming opponents
is against the rules!

00:06:46.033 --> 00:06:50.033
The kind that
makes troublemakers
like you disappear!

00:06:50.033 --> 00:06:52.400
Don't do it!
Please, stop!

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.700
(laughing wickedly)

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.433
(whimpering)

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.133
All those poor people.

00:07:00.133 --> 00:07:02.266
Attacked for no reason

00:07:02.266 --> 00:07:04.400
Trapped in cards&amp;

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.566
(screaming)

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.166
They'll pay!

00:07:09.166 --> 00:07:11.633
They'll pay
for what they did!

00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:20.866
We'll report in,
then complete our mission.

00:07:20.866 --> 00:07:23.800
You will complete
nothing!

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.666
You three are going to
suffer for what you've done!

00:07:27.666 --> 00:07:30.066
Revenge is supposed
to be bittersweet.

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:31.200
(chuckling)

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.133
But I'm betting it tastes
delish!

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.766
Let's duel!

00:07:36.766 --> 00:07:38.766
I call first turn!

00:07:38.766 --> 00:07:41.200
I summon
Edge Imp Tomahawk!

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.200
And now its special ability
activates!

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.600
By sending one Edge Imp monster
in my hand to the graveyard&amp;

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.866
Your life points
are cut down by 800!

00:07:56.866 --> 00:07:58.900
Argh!

00:08:02.066 --> 00:08:03.433
Not bad, huh?

00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:06.400
We just started and you're
already backing up!

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.800
Think you can
bounce back?

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.166
No doubt.

00:08:09.166 --> 00:08:12.600
Especially with Raid Raptor
Vanishing Lanius!

00:08:16.933 --> 00:08:18.166
When it's summoned
to my field,

00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:20.300
it can also
bring along a friend&amp;

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.400
meaning more monsters for me
and more danger for you!

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.866
Take flight, Raid Raptor
Fuzzy Lanius!

00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:30.466
With two Raid Raptors
at my command,

00:08:30.466 --> 00:08:32.766
I can build
the Overlay Network!

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.066
You made a huge mistake coming
after me, Sora!

00:08:40.066 --> 00:08:44.233
By hunting me down, you've
become the hunted instead!

00:08:44.233 --> 00:08:46.033
I Xyz Summon...

00:08:46.033 --> 00:08:48.700
Raid Raptor
Force Strix!

00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:57.600
Hmm? What's this
birdbrain up to?

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.366
Why'd he summon
such a turkey?

00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:02.900
By using one Overlay Unit,
I can add...

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:07.266
a Raid Raptor to my hand!

00:09:07.266 --> 00:09:10.233
I choose
Raid Raptor Vanishing Lanius.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.833
Huh, what's
he planning?

00:09:13.833 --> 00:09:17.200
Then I activate Fuzzy Lanias'
special ability

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.300
from the
graveyard!

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.000
I can add another Fuzzy Lanias
from my deck

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.033
directly
to my hand!

00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:26.066
And then I can use
the special ability

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:29.133
of the Vanishing Lanius
I summoned earlier this turn

00:09:29.133 --> 00:09:31.900
to bring out a second one
to the field!

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.466
Thanks for joining us!

00:09:36.466 --> 00:09:39.133
And now with
Vanishing Lanius on my field,

00:09:39.133 --> 00:09:42.066
I can summon Fuzzy Lanius
from my hand!

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.966
Last,
but not least,

00:09:45.966 --> 00:09:49.766
Raid Raptor Force Strix gets
an extra 500 attack points

00:09:49.766 --> 00:09:51.533
for each of its wingmen!

00:09:54.633 --> 00:09:57.500
After all that,
it's still a weakling.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.600
You're not playing
a joke on me, are you?

00:10:01.733 --> 00:10:05.333
I never kid around,
especially in a duel.

00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:09.100
Not when I'm facing off
against a clown like you!

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.933
("Lulu")
It's your move.

00:10:10.933 --> 00:10:12.600
What do you got?

00:10:14.833 --> 00:10:19.633
Something to tame
your fiery spirit.

00:10:19.633 --> 00:10:23.633
The time is now for your
expectations to be extinguished.

00:10:23.633 --> 00:10:29.166
Behold my blaze bashing
Fire Eater!

00:10:29.166 --> 00:10:31.766
Now I'm really
gonna turn up the drama,

00:10:31.766 --> 00:10:32.900
because with two monsters
on the field,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.800
I'm allowed to summon my
Performage Hat Tricker!

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.900
Ah!

00:10:43.466 --> 00:10:45.733
I see what
you're up to!

00:10:45.733 --> 00:10:47.566
You're going
to Xyz Summon!

00:10:47.566 --> 00:10:49.133
(groaning)

00:10:49.133 --> 00:10:53.233
If I do that, she's really
gonna think I'm a Xyz
fugitive.

00:10:53.233 --> 00:10:55.033
(moaning)

00:10:55.033 --> 00:10:56.800
It feels like something's
missing&amp;

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.733
I know!
Ha ha!

00:10:58.733 --> 00:11:00.633
Ready?

00:11:00.633 --> 00:11:01.666
Presto!

00:11:01.666 --> 00:11:02.600
(fingers snapping)

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.666
We all know nothing says fun and
excitement like getting bubbly!

00:11:08.666 --> 00:11:10.166
So thanks to Bubble Barrier,

00:11:10.166 --> 00:11:12.666
since my monsters have less than
1,500 attack points,

00:11:12.666 --> 00:11:14.266
I can bubble up
their defenses

00:11:14.266 --> 00:11:16.966
to stop any attacks
once per turn!

00:11:16.966 --> 00:11:19.100
And with that,
I'll hand it back to you!

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.333
Wait, that's all?

00:11:20.333 --> 00:11:22.533
Why didn't you
Xyz Summon?

00:11:22.533 --> 00:11:23.533
Why would I?

00:11:23.533 --> 00:11:24.800
It's not like
I'm a fugitive

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.500
from this so‐called Xyz
Dimension you're talking about.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.600
What is this dimension
thing anyway?

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.466
You can't
deceive me!

00:11:31.466 --> 00:11:34.333
So don't even try!

00:11:34.333 --> 00:11:37.766
I summon Lunalight Blue Cat!

00:11:42.466 --> 00:11:45.366
I activate Cat Dancer's
special ability!

00:11:45.366 --> 00:11:48.266
By tributing my Blue Cat...

00:11:48.266 --> 00:11:52.300
My Cat Dancer can attack
each of your monsters twice!

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.500
A brilliant move!

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.066
Dancer, pounce on
Flame Eater!

00:11:59.166 --> 00:12:01.233
That might burst
Flame Eater's bubble,

00:12:01.233 --> 00:12:04.700
but Flame Eater's still
safe and sound.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.800
But not from
a second attack!

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.366
Cat Dancer,
kick it up a notch

00:12:09.366 --> 00:12:12.433
and take it to Flame Eater
one more time!

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.800
(groaning)

00:12:16.833 --> 00:12:19.566
Now, Cat Dancer,
burst that bubble!

00:12:23.066 --> 00:12:26.900
(Dennis)
Don't worry, Hat Tricker,
your bubble will protect you!

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.100
It will take more than
a few suds to stop Cat Dancer!

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.033
Now attack again
and blast that buffoon!

00:12:33.033 --> 00:12:35.133
Full Moon Mayhem!

00:12:43.233 --> 00:12:45.333
(groaning)

00:12:49.233 --> 00:12:51.266
With that I'll end my turn.

00:12:55.266 --> 00:12:57.966
You're putting on
quite the show!

00:12:57.966 --> 00:13:00.933
Her skills as a Fusion Summoner
are incredible!

00:13:00.933 --> 00:13:02.366
(gasps)

00:13:02.366 --> 00:13:06.366
Does that mean she's really
from from the Fusion Dimension?

00:13:10.166 --> 00:13:12.233
Enough of this!

00:13:12.233 --> 00:13:16.300
I tried to stop you, but you
wouldn't listen to me!

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.300
Who is that guy?

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.100
You invaded
my dimension.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.266
I want to know why!

00:13:24.266 --> 00:13:27.033
You're in no position
to demand anything.

00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:28.166
All right then.

00:13:28.166 --> 00:13:29.866
You leave me
no choice.

00:13:29.866 --> 00:13:33.200
If you want to feel my wrath...
I'm all in!

00:13:34.066 --> 00:13:35.833
(all laughing)

00:13:35.833 --> 00:13:38.066
The kid
is clearly delusional.

00:13:38.066 --> 00:13:39.966
Better straighten
him out, then.

00:13:41.933 --> 00:13:43.400
Let's duel!

00:13:44.266 --> 00:13:46.900
Get ready!
Ha ha ha!

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.400
We're gonna sic
the dogs on you, twerp!

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.366
Starting with Ancient Gear
Hunting Hound!

00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:54.866
There's more coming!

00:13:54.866 --> 00:13:56.733
A whole pack
of hounds!

00:13:56.733 --> 00:13:58.200
They're hungry!

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.633
And raring
to go!

00:13:59.633 --> 00:14:01.900
I can't hold Ancient Gear
Hunting Hound back any longer!

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.900
Now go get 'em, boy!

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.366
Uh...

00:14:11.933 --> 00:14:14.833
If you think that card
will save you...

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.366
You're wrong!

00:14:17.366 --> 00:14:20.000
Fact is, once our Hounds
have zeroed in on you,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.800
nothing can
keep them at bay!

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.766
Sic him,
Hunting Hound!

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.466
(screaming)

00:14:29.466 --> 00:14:31.366
(groaning)

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.500
We've got him down.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.300
Now let's
take him out!

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.500
I'm sending another
Ancient Gear Hunting Hound

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.233
to join
in the hunt!

00:14:40.133 --> 00:14:41.500
Rough him up
some more!

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.700
(screaming)

00:14:44.766 --> 00:14:46.200
(groaning)

00:14:47.433 --> 00:14:49.533
Had enough?
No.

00:14:49.533 --> 00:14:51.466
Well, too bad, 'cause
you're going to end up

00:14:51.466 --> 00:14:53.666
just like the knights
you tried to save.

00:14:53.666 --> 00:14:54.900
But don't worry.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.866
The four of you will
make an awesome deck!

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.666
(moaning)

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.466
Yaaaah!

00:15:30.466 --> 00:15:32.033
It's my turn!

00:15:32.033 --> 00:15:33.500
(screaming)

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.866
I'll use
Scale 3 Xiangke Magician

00:15:35.866 --> 00:15:39.866
and Scale 8 Xiangsheng Magician
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:15:39.866 --> 00:15:43.233
I'm taking control
of this duel, starting now!

00:15:51.866 --> 00:15:54.800
Now I can summon monsters
between Level 4 and 7

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.566
all at the same time!

00:15:56.566 --> 00:15:59.100
Swing far,
Pendulum!

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.933
Carve the arc of victory!

00:16:02.233 --> 00:16:07.400
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.733
Come forth,
Performapal Whip Snake!

00:16:10.733 --> 00:16:15.600
And Skeeter Skimmer!

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.500
Maybe the kid is more
dangerous than we thought.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.166
With Level 4 Performapal Whip
Snake and Skeeter Skimmer,

00:16:22.166 --> 00:16:24.500
I build
the Overlay Network.

00:16:27.533 --> 00:16:30.566
Cloaked in shadows and
relentless in its objective.

00:16:30.566 --> 00:16:33.866
I call upon the most dangerous
of Dragons!

00:16:33.866 --> 00:16:36.366
I Xyz Summon!

00:16:36.366 --> 00:16:38.700
(screaming)

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:42.333
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:16:42.333 --> 00:16:43.966
(thunder crashing)

00:16:45.366 --> 00:16:49.633
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon,
attack Hunting Hound!

00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:51.866
Mauling Mandible Charge!

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.866
(grunting)

00:16:57.866 --> 00:16:59.500
(groaning)

00:17:00.833 --> 00:17:03.666
It's your move
if you dare take it.

00:17:03.666 --> 00:17:07.300
We gotta teach this guy
a lesson he'll never forget!

00:17:15.633 --> 00:17:17.266
Shay seems to have
a real fondness

00:17:17.266 --> 00:17:18.833
for his feathered
friends.

00:17:18.833 --> 00:17:21.466
I can't wait to pluck
them from the sky!

00:17:21.466 --> 00:17:24.766
If you're hoping to make up
for losing to me,

00:17:24.766 --> 00:17:27.933
you're only going
to end up disappointed.

00:17:27.933 --> 00:17:29.200
Please.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.100
Beating you will be like
taking candy from a baby.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.366
(slurping)

00:17:36.866 --> 00:17:38.266
If you believe that,

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:40.466
you're a bigger sucker
than the one in your hand,

00:17:40.466 --> 00:17:41.800
especially after

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.100
I have two Raid Raptor Singing
Laniuses join my team!

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.500
My preparations
are complete.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.866
Due to the two new Raid Raptors
on my team,

00:17:52.866 --> 00:17:55.733
Force Strixes' attack
points increase.

00:17:55.733 --> 00:17:59.400
From this point forward, I'm
coming at you full force!

00:18:02.933 --> 00:18:05.566
I've had enough of
your ridiculous games!

00:18:05.566 --> 00:18:07.033
I came to duel you!

00:18:07.033 --> 00:18:09.566
But you're turning
this into a circus!

00:18:09.566 --> 00:18:12.566
Sorry.
Okay...

00:18:12.566 --> 00:18:14.433
If you want me
to duel seriously,

00:18:14.433 --> 00:18:17.900
that's exactly
what I'll do!

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.133
Get ready!

00:18:19.133 --> 00:18:21.866
Here's
a real showstopper!

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.833
I didn't mean it
literally!

00:18:26.833 --> 00:18:29.100
I feel like
such a flop!

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.266
My only choice is to put a
monster facedown in defense mode

00:18:32.266 --> 00:18:33.366
and another card facedown

00:18:33.366 --> 00:18:36.233
because that's all a loser
like me can do!

00:18:40.066 --> 00:18:44.833
Are you hoping that I feel
sorry and go easy on you?

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:47.100
'Cause that is not
about to happen!

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.233
Uh, No! I would
never want that‐

00:18:49.233 --> 00:18:50.233
Enough!
My turn!

00:18:50.233 --> 00:18:52.166
I draw!

00:18:52.166 --> 00:18:55.766
Now jumping into the fray is
Lunalight White Rabbit!

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.033
My White Rabbit can return a
spell or trap card to your hand!

00:19:02.033 --> 00:19:04.466
So bye‐bye, Bubble Barrier!

00:19:07.966 --> 00:19:10.800
Cat Dancer's special ability
activates!

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.266
She'll tribute White Rabbit
so she can attack twice!

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.533
It's on!

00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:21.766
Cat Dancer, strike at his
facedown card!

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.866
Cat Dancer's first attack
didn't destroy your monster,

00:19:31.866 --> 00:19:34.200
but it let me activate
Lunalight Dance

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.200
which switches your
monster to attack mode!

00:19:40.066 --> 00:19:41.466
Oh, dear.

00:19:41.466 --> 00:19:44.633
If you think that's bad,
it gets worse.

00:19:44.633 --> 00:19:48.900
Its attack points
get slashed in half!

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.233
Cat Dancer!

00:19:50.233 --> 00:19:52.366
Take down that Clown!

00:19:54.333 --> 00:19:55.900
Hang on!

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.033
I'll stop you
in a snap!

00:20:01.733 --> 00:20:02.700
Uh...

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.600
(screaming)

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.466
Much too easy.
Humph!

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.766
Hmm?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Hmm!
Huh!

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.733
(alarm blaring)

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:37.500
(man)
A unit of Fusion warriors just
warped into the Volcano Zone!

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.533
Send in my strike
squadron.

00:20:39.533 --> 00:20:41.800
(laughing wickedly)

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.066
(whimpering)

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.200
You're coming with us.

00:21:01.633 --> 00:21:04.000
This is the end of the line,
gentlemen.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.033
The city's been
sealed off!

00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:09.233
But I need
to find my Yuya!

00:21:09.233 --> 00:21:12.366
In a city this big though,
he could be anywhere!

00:21:13.733 --> 00:21:16.033
I'll have to rely on the
unbreakable bond we share

00:21:16.033 --> 00:21:17.866
to guide my heart
to him.

00:21:19.866 --> 00:21:22.800
Let's wipe that smirk
off his face.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.766
Right, let's take him
out quick!

00:21:24.766 --> 00:21:26.066
That's no problem!

00:21:26.066 --> 00:21:28.200
Let's start by
unleashing the Hounds!

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.633
Hunting Hound's special
ability deals you 600 points of
damage!

00:21:31.633 --> 00:21:33.266
Canine Cannon!

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.300
Argh!

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.900
Don't let up!

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.533
Go!
Got it!

00:21:44.533 --> 00:21:46.800
Give him a grilling,
Hunting Hound!

00:21:55.666 --> 00:21:56.900
Uh...

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.633
Don't just stand there!

00:22:04.666 --> 00:22:06.866
Where's my Yuya?

00:22:06.866 --> 00:22:08.800
Huh?
Huh?

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.000
Looks like we found him!
And so did trouble!

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.300
Yuya?!

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.833
(laughing wildly)

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:10.000
