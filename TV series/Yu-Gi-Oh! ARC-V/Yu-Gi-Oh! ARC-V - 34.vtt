(announcer)
Previously on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh!
ARC‐V"...

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.933
It's time for today's
third mega match up!

00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.300
It's You Show School's
Sora Perse

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.066
versus Leo Institute's
Shay Obsidian!

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.866
I can't believe Shay's dueling
for the Leo Institute

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.933
after all the drama
he had with Julia.

00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.233
Shay was the one who
attacked Julia's professor

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:22.233
and all those LID students.

00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:24.400
Something weird's
definitely going on here.

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:29.133
Fusion Summoners like you
deserve no mercy.

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.833
And none will be shown!

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:33.033
(both)
Let's duel!

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.600
Let's make this
the funnest show

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.700
anybody here's
ever seen!

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.733
The days of dueling for fun

00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.466
no longer exist for me
and my friends.

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.600
Dueling is about survival.
Huh?

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.500
The joy and happiness,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.866
it was all taken away
that day.

00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:52.100
They just showed up,
they wrecked our city.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.200
The enemy took
everything away from us.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.633
What city?
Who was this enemy?!

00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:00.433
Countless were taken
on that dark day.

00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:02.733
I Xyz Summon!

00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:07.166
Witness the assent of
Raidraptor Rise Falcon!

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.933
Attack with
Ravaging Rebellion!

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:15.833
Ahh!

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:17.966
(Nico)
Unbelievable!

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:21.800
Will Sora be able to stand up
to this aerial onslaught?

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:26.100
You better get ready
for some plot twists.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.933
And I'm sure you won't
like the ending!

(Nico)
Shay's aerial onslaught

00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:36.800
has wiped all of
Sora's monsters off his field!

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.400
Can Sora do anything
to get back into this game?

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.666
Just watch me. Ha!

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:46.466
I think my Edge Imp Saw
can cut the mustard!

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:52.433
With this razor sharp
shredder out,

00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:55.800
I can send a Fluffal monster
in my hand to the graveyard

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.933
to draw two more cards.

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:01.166
Nice.

00:03:01.166 --> 00:03:04.133
I activate the spell
Fusion Conscription.

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:05.966
I get a monster from my deck

00:03:05.966 --> 00:03:07.700
that I can use
to Fusion Summon.

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:13.966
(thinking)
This will bring the house to
its feet and Shay to his knees.

00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:16.033
Now watch closely!

00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:18.566
Uh, I could use a spotlight
over here, please!

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.866
And away we go!

00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:24.666
Ha ha!

00:03:24.666 --> 00:03:27.200
This kid's a showman
just like Sakaki!

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.433
He is like me.

00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:31.666
He's picked a great
role model, Yuya.

00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:33.933
Let's manufacture
a little mayhem

00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:36.300
with the spell
Frightfur Factory!

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.533
By banishing Polymerization
from my graveyard,

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:43.400
I'm allowed to Fusion Summon
another Frightfur monster.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.966
So without further ado,

00:03:44.966 --> 00:03:47.633
I'm going to fuse
Edge Imp Saw and Fluffal Leo!

00:03:51.733 --> 00:03:54.200
Oh, what a cute lion!

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.166
It's awesome!

00:03:56.166 --> 00:03:59.100
(Sora)
Sharpened steel
and ruler of the jungle,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.933
when the two come together,
prepare to rumble!

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.100
I Fusion Summon...

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.966
Frightfur Leo!

00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:18.833
(crying)
Mommy, that's too scary!

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.533
Is Shay running away
from this terrifying toy?

00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:28.100
Ha! Don't you
wanna play, Shay?

00:04:33.233 --> 00:04:35.300
He won't get too far...

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.800
not from Frightfur Leo's
special ability!

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.566
It destroys your monster

00:04:39.566 --> 00:04:42.033
and you take
its attack points as damage!

00:04:55.866 --> 00:04:58.933
I activate the
Action Spell Mirror Barrier

00:04:58.933 --> 00:05:02.166
to keep Rise Falcon safe
and my life points secure!

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.666
Huh?

00:05:12.366 --> 00:05:15.200
(groaning)

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.766
Sora's Frightfur Leo's been
caged like a wild animal!

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:21.900
And that means
big trouble for Sora!

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.033
Shay obviously knows
exactly what he's doing

00:05:29.033 --> 00:05:30.600
with his trap
and spell cards.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.600
He's quite impressive.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.933
Mr. President,
if I may,

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:36.866
where do you think
Shay learned to duel

00:05:36.866 --> 00:05:39.166
with such precision
and foresight?

00:05:39.166 --> 00:05:41.366
Skills like his
can only be developed

00:05:41.366 --> 00:05:43.766
under the most strenuous
of circumstances.

00:05:43.766 --> 00:05:45.433
Circumstances
where your decisions

00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:48.300
affect the lives of
those around you.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.266
Frightfur Leo,
saw your way out!

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.200
I must say,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.833
Sora's monster
is certainly

00:06:03.833 --> 00:06:05.833
cutting the competition
to the quick!

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:08.733
Sorry, but when Frightfur
Leo does something,

00:06:08.733 --> 00:06:10.900
it always creates
a big buzz!

00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:20.933
And now that my Leo's
on the prowl again,

00:06:20.933 --> 00:06:23.266
your Falcon's
back in the lion's den!

00:06:27.033 --> 00:06:28.933
I admit grabbing
that Action Card

00:06:28.933 --> 00:06:31.333
to protect you and your
monster was a nice try,

00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:33.400
but there's no real
protection from a monster

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.133
that's all claws and saws.

00:06:35.133 --> 00:06:37.800
A Leo with
2,400 attack points

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.533
versus a bird
with just 100

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:41.700
means your wings
are about to get clipped!

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.266
Leo...

00:06:43.266 --> 00:06:46.166
pounce on Raidraptor
Rise Falcon!

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.733
I activate
the trap card Adversity!

00:06:52.733 --> 00:06:56.133
Since your Leo has more
attack points than Rise Falcon,

00:06:56.133 --> 00:06:57.933
this trap protects
my monster

00:06:57.933 --> 00:07:00.266
and my life points
once again!

00:07:00.266 --> 00:07:01.700
Not only that,

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.300
my monster also gains
an extra 1,000 attack points!

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.800
No way!
That was spectacular!

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.400
Shay not only snatched his
Falcon from the saws of defeat,

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.900
he picked up some attack points
in the process!

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.000
Tremendous trapping, Shay!

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.566
I agree.

00:07:18.566 --> 00:07:21.333
We could use this guy.

00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:22.566
Ahh!

00:07:22.566 --> 00:07:25.200
I'll bash that
big turkey, Shay!

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.066
But for now,
I end my turn!

00:07:27.066 --> 00:07:29.066
Whoa, Sora's not too happy.

00:07:29.066 --> 00:07:32.800
This is the first time
I've ever seen him angry.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.533
Simmer down!

00:07:34.533 --> 00:07:37.233
Even if he burns you up,
you gotta keep your cool!

00:07:37.233 --> 00:07:38.933
Don't blow a gasket!

00:07:38.933 --> 00:07:40.466
I know!

00:07:40.466 --> 00:07:42.533
Don't worry,
I just lost it for a second.

00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:44.900
I'm fine now,
it's all good!

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:49.266
Let's see how good you are

00:07:49.266 --> 00:07:52.300
after I activate
Falcon's special ability.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.500
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.266
it gains the attack points
of your Frightfur Leo.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.733
Rise Falcon,
attack Frightfur Leo!

00:08:07.166 --> 00:08:10.033
Guess again, Shay!

00:08:10.033 --> 00:08:12.366
I play Evasion
to dodge your attack!

00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:13.633
It won't work

00:08:13.633 --> 00:08:16.366
'cause I'm activating
the trap Raptor's Storm!

00:08:16.366 --> 00:08:18.300
This trap
stops your spell,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.366
so you're not
evading anything!

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:22.666
Your Leo's about to
get blasted...

00:08:22.666 --> 00:08:24.033
and so are you!

00:08:27.133 --> 00:08:29.833
No!

00:08:31.633 --> 00:08:33.100
(both)
Sora!

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.366
I place two cards facedown
and end my turn.

00:08:36.366 --> 00:08:39.033
Rise Falcon's
special ability ends

00:08:39.033 --> 00:08:41.366
and its attack points
return to normal.

00:08:41.366 --> 00:08:43.600
(Yuya)
Sora, you all right?

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.300
(Sora grunting)

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.600
You're really
starting to bug me.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.700
I've been too easy on you
so far, Shay.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.433
But now, I'm taking
the gloves off.

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:56.933
I'm taking this brawl
to the wall.

00:08:58.366 --> 00:09:00.400
Let's get it on!

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.300
First up, I activate
the spell card Suture Rebirth,

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.966
which lets me stitch
my Fluffal Sheep back together

00:09:07.966 --> 00:09:09.866
so it's good as new!

00:09:11.566 --> 00:09:14.533
Then I activate
the spell Frightfur Factory.

00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:17.366
By banishing Fusion Conscription
from my graveyard,

00:09:17.366 --> 00:09:20.933
I'm allowed to fuse two
of my monster's together!

00:09:20.933 --> 00:09:23.366
Chain of destruction,
Wool of warrior,

00:09:23.366 --> 00:09:27.366
when the two come together,
none are superior!

00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:30.533
I Fusion Summon!

00:09:30.533 --> 00:09:32.433
Presenting...

00:09:32.433 --> 00:09:35.333
the heavyweight
champion‐sheep of chains,

00:09:35.333 --> 00:09:37.366
Frightfur Sheep!

00:09:39.966 --> 00:09:42.266
When this baaa‐d boy
attacks you,

00:09:42.266 --> 00:09:45.566
you can't activate
your spell or trap cards!

00:09:45.566 --> 00:09:48.733
That really puts you
up against the ropes.

00:09:48.733 --> 00:09:52.000
Well, this should be
interesting.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.666
Go, Frightfur Sheep!

00:09:54.666 --> 00:09:57.566
Attack Raidraptor
Rise Falcon!

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.300
All right!
The way Sora shut down

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.300
all of Shay's spells and traps,
he couldn't do anything!

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.066
My gooses is all pickley!

00:10:26.066 --> 00:10:27.800
You think you outplayed me

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.800
because you destroyed
my monster?

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.266
Well, you shouldn't
pat yourself on the back yet

00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:35.800
because you can't get rid of
my birds that easily.
Huh?!

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.900
I activate the spell card

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.133
Rank‐Up‐Magic Raptor's Force!

00:10:41.133 --> 00:10:44.266
This card ranks up
the Rise Falcon you destroyed

00:10:44.266 --> 00:10:46.766
into an even more
powerful monster.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.700
More powerful?
(screaming, gasping)

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.233
Terror of the skies,

00:10:54.233 --> 00:10:56.333
predator of blazing force

00:10:56.333 --> 00:10:59.133
with wings that slash
and talons that tear...

00:11:01.833 --> 00:11:05.500
go, Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.366
Rise up, Raidraptor
Blaze Falcon!

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.100
(Nico)
Shay's taken this battle
to new heights

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.833
as he's summoned
a ferocious new Raidraptor!

00:11:22.833 --> 00:11:26.566
Can he use it to soar
over Sora and win this duel?

00:11:26.566 --> 00:11:28.633
That's an Xyz
Summon technique

00:11:28.633 --> 00:11:30.866
I haven't even
learned at school yet.

00:11:30.866 --> 00:11:33.400
Shay's on a totally
different level.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.066
He's on a level
beyond levels!

00:11:36.666 --> 00:11:38.933
(chuckling)

00:11:38.933 --> 00:11:41.266
Slick move, Shay!

00:11:41.266 --> 00:11:43.933
I underestimated you
as an entertainer.

00:11:43.933 --> 00:11:46.866
You really know how
to cook up the drama.

00:11:46.866 --> 00:11:49.866
And the crowd's
obviously loving it.

00:11:49.866 --> 00:11:51.966
I hate to admit this,

00:11:51.966 --> 00:11:54.466
but I'm really
loving it, too!

00:11:54.466 --> 00:11:56.766
Now it's your turn
in the spotlight.

00:11:56.766 --> 00:11:59.600
So let's see
what you got.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.833
Come on, Shay,
entertain me.

00:12:01.833 --> 00:12:03.833
Entertain?

00:12:03.833 --> 00:12:06.500
I highly doubt you'll find
destruction and defeat

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.533
very entertaining.
Huh?

00:12:08.533 --> 00:12:10.666
My turn!

00:12:10.666 --> 00:12:13.833
I activate my Falcon's
special ability!

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:16.066
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:12:16.066 --> 00:12:18.433
it can destroy the monster
on your field

00:12:18.433 --> 00:12:21.866
and you take 500 points
of damage for it!

00:12:24.233 --> 00:12:27.400
Now that's a special
special ability, folks!

00:12:29.566 --> 00:12:31.433
My trap card'll stop that...

00:12:31.433 --> 00:12:34.100
Frightfur Defender!

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.400
It doesn't just save
my Frightfur Sheep,

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.333
it gives it 800 extra
attack points!

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.933
(Nico)
The scrappy young Sora
shuts Shay down once again

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:50.333
and roars to
a commanding advantage

00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:52.400
with that attack point
power up!

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.166
Yeah, you sure
showed him, Sora!

00:12:55.166 --> 00:12:57.300
But the city!

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.166
(gasps)

00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:06.433
(gasping)

00:13:06.433 --> 00:13:09.400
I don't care how strong
that Sheep is...

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.233
Blaze Falcon's
special ability

00:13:11.233 --> 00:13:13.366
lets it attack you directly.

00:13:13.366 --> 00:13:15.566
(Nico)
Shay's turning up the heat

00:13:15.566 --> 00:13:17.800
and he's got Sora on the run!

00:13:18.866 --> 00:13:20.166
Ahh!

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.733
Ahh! The whole
building's collapsing!

00:13:29.733 --> 00:13:30.933
Look out!

00:13:30.933 --> 00:13:33.200
Sora!
Huh?

00:13:38.833 --> 00:13:40.333
Amazing.

00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:42.433
Those maneuvers
are incredible.

00:13:50.033 --> 00:13:52.666
Since Blaze Falcon
dealt you damage,

00:13:52.666 --> 00:13:55.933
its special ability destroys
your Frightfur Sheep.

00:13:59.266 --> 00:14:00.966
No way!

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.633
I activate the Action Spell
Mirror Barrier!

00:14:05.633 --> 00:14:08.066
So my Frightfur Leo's
gonna stick around

00:14:08.066 --> 00:14:10.200
safe and sound.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.833
Sora saves himself
with an Action Spell!

00:14:12.833 --> 00:14:15.133
How very ironic
that it's the same spell

00:14:15.133 --> 00:14:16.900
that Shay used himself.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.466
I play the trap...

00:14:18.466 --> 00:14:20.400
Raptor's Storm!

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.333
You thought you
protected yourself,

00:14:22.333 --> 00:14:24.866
but this gust is going to
blow that spell away!

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.266
Another shocker from Shay!

00:14:30.266 --> 00:14:31.800
All right!

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.366
Even that spell couldn't
protect that kid's sheep from
Shay!

00:14:34.366 --> 00:14:37.200
He's always prepared for
whatever Sora springs on him.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.566
That's the sign of
a real pro.

00:14:39.566 --> 00:14:41.600
This duel is like a seesaw.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.166
Two titans slugging it out
toe‐to‐toe

00:14:45.166 --> 00:14:46.833
and the crowd's thrilled!

00:14:46.833 --> 00:14:48.966
Except for that little girl.

00:14:48.966 --> 00:14:52.466
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:14:53.933 --> 00:14:55.666
I'm almost
through with you.

00:14:55.666 --> 00:14:58.400
But don't worry,
the worst is still to come.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.933
Now you know what it's like
to be helpless like we were.

00:15:01.933 --> 00:15:04.866
Helpless as you
and your fusion friends

00:15:04.866 --> 00:15:07.466
launched a surprise attack
on our home.

00:15:07.466 --> 00:15:10.300
The difference between us
and you, though?

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.266
We always found a way
to fight back,

00:15:12.266 --> 00:15:14.966
even when the odds
were stacked against us.

00:15:14.966 --> 00:15:17.600
Shay's acting crazy.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.166
What's going on?

00:15:19.166 --> 00:15:21.966
Ha ha!
You think I'm through?

00:15:21.966 --> 00:15:24.900
You think I'm one bit worried
about losing to you?

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.266
If you do, you're a bigger
sucker than I thought you were.

00:15:31.633 --> 00:15:33.466
Poor Shay...

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:35.533
still thinking
you have a chance.

00:15:35.533 --> 00:15:38.366
Well, here's
a reality check!

00:15:38.366 --> 00:15:39.933
You're going to lose.

00:15:39.933 --> 00:15:41.866
It's the one thing
you're good at.

00:15:41.866 --> 00:15:43.800
Isn't that right, Shay?

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.700
You were no match for us
when we attacked

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.300
and you're no match
for me now!

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.766
And now Sora's
talking crazy!

00:15:49.766 --> 00:15:51.633
What's going on
between these two?

00:15:51.633 --> 00:15:54.066
(gasping)

00:15:54.066 --> 00:15:56.266
Let's play!

00:15:56.266 --> 00:15:59.633
I activate the spell
Frightfur Fusion!

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.933
By banishing
Frightfur Bear,

00:16:02.933 --> 00:16:04.800
Frightfur Leo
and Frightfur Sheep,

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.233
I can Fusion Summon

00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:09.033
a frightening new
Frightfur monster!

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.300
Fury of bear, king of
the jungle, sheep of chains,

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.200
when the three come together,
victory is attained!

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.500
I Fusion Summon!

00:16:22.833 --> 00:16:24.966
Come on out,
my mighty mash‐up,

00:16:24.966 --> 00:16:27.300
Frightfur Chimera!

00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:34.700
(murmuring)

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.033
Ready?

00:16:38.033 --> 00:16:41.966
Frightfur Chimera,
attack Blaze Falcon!

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.766
Chimera's special
ability activates.

00:16:54.766 --> 00:16:57.966
The monster it destroys
is summoned on to my field

00:16:57.966 --> 00:17:00.266
to use anyway I please.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.433
And for every monster
I take control of

00:17:03.433 --> 00:17:04.966
using this special ability,

00:17:04.966 --> 00:17:08.433
my Frightfur Chimera gains
an additional 300 attack points.

00:17:10.566 --> 00:17:12.533
You see, Shay?

00:17:12.533 --> 00:17:14.700
Weaklings like you
can't win.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.366
That's why you're so much
fun to hunt down and destroy!

00:17:23.733 --> 00:17:25.466
You see, Shay?

00:17:25.466 --> 00:17:27.766
Weaklings like you
can't win.

00:17:27.766 --> 00:17:30.633
That's why you're so much
fun to hunt down and destroy!

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:33.300
Always were,
always will be!

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.266
Why's Sora
acting so mean?

00:17:36.266 --> 00:17:39.500
Finishing you off by wiping
you out with your own monster

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.600
makes things
so much more entertaining.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.666
You only have
400 life points left,

00:17:43.666 --> 00:17:45.400
so if Blaze Falcon
attacks you,

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.800
it will end this duel!

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.033
No, it won't.
It won't?

00:17:49.033 --> 00:17:50.600
When you're forced
to be a duelist

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.966
fighting for his freedom,

00:17:51.966 --> 00:17:55.066
you learn to always prepare
for any worst‐case scenario.

00:17:55.066 --> 00:17:56.800
We even think about
what to do

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.033
if one of us
is taken by the enemy.
(gasps)

00:18:00.033 --> 00:18:03.600
And there's
oneunbreakable rule‐‐

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.066
we never leave
anyone behind.

00:18:06.066 --> 00:18:08.033
We get our comrades back.

00:18:08.033 --> 00:18:10.433
And that's what
I plan to do!

00:18:13.266 --> 00:18:17.466
I activate the spell
Rank‐Up‐Magic Revolution Force!

00:18:17.466 --> 00:18:20.466
It lets me get
my Blaze Falcon back!

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:23.300
Huh? What?

00:18:24.966 --> 00:18:28.466
Now, it ranks up to become
an even stronger monster!

00:18:28.466 --> 00:18:30.066
Ahh!

00:18:30.066 --> 00:18:33.300
Fiercest falcon,
set your wings ablaze

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.033
and lock your gaze
on our ill‐fated foe!

00:18:36.033 --> 00:18:38.300
Now, make it so!

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.500
Go, Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:45.433
Emerge, Raidraptor
Revolution Falcon!

00:18:49.933 --> 00:18:52.200
Watch him closely, Riley.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.166
If what I believe is true,

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:57.500
then he might be the key
to helping us save our world.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.000
Huh?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.533
Ha. Nice try, Shay.

00:19:03.533 --> 00:19:05.300
But your bluff
doesn't scare me,

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.533
not for a second.

00:19:06.533 --> 00:19:08.966
Your monster's only got
2,000 attack points.

00:19:08.966 --> 00:19:12.266
My Frightfur Chimera's
got 2,800 attack points,

00:19:12.266 --> 00:19:14.000
so you can't destroy it!

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.700
Just watch me.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.100
Huh? Really?

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.400
Just another one of
your bluffs, Shay.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.600
You talk a good game,
but take a look around.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.500
You don't have what it takes
to pull out a win.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.633
Sora, just walk away!

00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:29.100
He's dangerous!

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:33.066
I activate Revolution Falcon's
special ability!

00:19:33.066 --> 00:19:34.866
It destroys your monster

00:19:34.866 --> 00:19:38.266
and you take damage equal
to half its attack points.

00:19:38.266 --> 00:19:41.966
Oh, no!
Go, Revolution Falcon!

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.300
Burn, blaze,
torch the enemy!

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.566
Stop it!
This isn't how you should duel!

00:19:56.566 --> 00:19:59.600
Dueling is supposed to make
people happy, not scare them!

00:20:08.966 --> 00:20:10.600
Ahh!

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.233
Oh, no!
Sora!

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.800
(gasps)
We have a winner!

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.200
This duel goes to Shay!

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:44.166
(gasping)

00:20:46.866 --> 00:20:48.433
(Declan)
<i>Leave him.</i>

00:20:48.433 --> 00:20:50.500
This is neither the time,
nor the place

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.466
<i>for any further action.</i>

00:20:52.466 --> 00:20:55.300
Our goal is to
obtain information

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.933
and that is what
I intend to do.

00:20:56.933 --> 00:20:58.333
I'll see to it

00:20:58.333 --> 00:21:01.066
that he tells us everything
he knows about our enemies,

00:21:01.066 --> 00:21:03.333
especially Duel Academy.

00:21:03.333 --> 00:21:04.400
Understood?

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.633
Wait!

00:21:09.633 --> 00:21:11.933
The battle's
not over yet.

00:21:11.933 --> 00:21:13.866
(grunting)

00:21:15.766 --> 00:21:18.766
I can't...
I can't lose...

00:21:19.766 --> 00:21:22.333
Not to an Xyz Summoner!

00:21:22.333 --> 00:21:24.766
It's impossible!

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.166
No, Shay!
Duel me!

00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:33.166
I... want a rematch!

00:21:33.166 --> 00:21:35.033
You have to duel me!

00:21:35.033 --> 00:21:36.800
Don't go!

00:21:38.433 --> 00:21:40.200
Sora!

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.100
No!

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.366
Sora!

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:09.433
