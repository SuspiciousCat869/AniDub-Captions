WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.400
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.133
All right!

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.566
This is perfect!

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.433
It all starts
tomorrow.

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:11.566
My first step
to becoming a pro

00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.000
and I'm gonna win the four duels
I need to qualify

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.633
for the Junior Arc League
Championship with this deck.

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:19.766
You're certainly here
bright and early.

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.166
You have your first
big duel this morning

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.666
and I have my first duels
today, just like you.

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.766
You mean you're dueling
today to try to get into

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.766
the Junior Arc League
Championship, too?

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:29.933
Yeah.

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.800
Since I only have to
win six matches in a row,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.700
it'll be a breeze!

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.566
(Nico)
Allow me to introduce your
celebrity opponent for today,

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.333
the king of the kitchen,
Reed Pepper!

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.600
And now,
may I present Chairman Fava!

00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:50.900
I activate the Action Field
Spell Chaos Kitchen!

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.833
Duel!
Duel!

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.766
I hope your monsters enjoyed
their meal, Yuya,

00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.600
because it was their last.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.166
By returning Princess Pudding,
Knight Pasta

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.933
and Prince Curry to my hand,

00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:07.400
I destroy one of your
monsters for each card!

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.566
No way!

00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:13.833
I hope losing doesn't leave
a bad taste in your mouth.

(Gong)
Gong's gotta do it!

00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:28.766
Gotta make my Heavystrong
dueling style even stronger!

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:31.933
And you stay strong,
too, Yuya.

00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:33.633
You can't lose your duel!

00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:36.600
Ahh...

00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:38.900
(chuckling)

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.633
You may have me
in a pickle now...

00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:45.133
... but you won't
for long.

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:46.366
What's Yuya gonna do with

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:47.933
all his
Pendulum Monsters gone?

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:49.966
There's not much
he can do!

00:02:49.966 --> 00:02:52.800
It's a good thing Reed's
Cookpals are gone too,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.733
or Yuya would really
have the eggs on his face!

00:02:55.933 --> 00:02:58.333
I think I need to
soup up this duel.

00:02:58.333 --> 00:02:59.666
Bring things to
the boiling point.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.133
I've got three cards
in my Food Cemetery,

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:06.200
just the ingredients
I need!

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.000
Chew on this, Yuya.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.133
I activate
Regal Recipes.

00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:12.266
This is one of my
sweetest spells!

00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:14.933
It lets me summon the same
number of Royal Cookpals

00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:17.400
as there are cards
in my Food Cemetery.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.000
He's got three monsters
in Food Cemetery.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.700
So the three Royal Cookpals

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.633
that just chewed me up
are coming back.

00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:27.033
It's time to
serve 'em up!

00:03:30.566 --> 00:03:31.733
One order of
Knight Pasta...

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:35.966
... one Prince Curry,

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:38.000
and one
Princess Pudding!

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.200
These monsters are
ruining my appetite...

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.266
(stomach grumbling)

00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:46.666
... which is a good thing
because I'm starving!

00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:47.966
Then it looks like
you're going to lose

00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:49.566
some weight and some
life points!

00:03:51.533 --> 00:03:54.133
For every monster summoned
by Regal Recipes,

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:55.400
you take
300 points of damage.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.933
Sorry, but if you can't
take the beat down

00:04:06.933 --> 00:04:08.100
you should stay
out of my kitchen.

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:10.700
That's right,
you tell 'em!

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.800
And I'm afraid that'sjust
a taste of what

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.433
<i>you're in for, Yuya.</i>

00:04:14.433 --> 00:04:17.033
He thinks
he's the top chef‐‐ ha.

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:18.866
Brace yourself,'cause
Knight Pasta's

00:04:18.866 --> 00:04:21.100
<i>special abilityactivates,</i>

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.166
doubling the attack points
of my Royal Cookpal...

00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:25.200
Prince Curry!

00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:31.133
And now Princess Pudding's
special ability activates,

00:04:31.133 --> 00:04:33.566
doubling Prince Curry's
attack points once again.

00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:39.433
Wow!

00:04:39.433 --> 00:04:41.500
Your dueling's
deliciously divine!

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.966
The downside of doubling
my prince's attack points

00:04:43.966 --> 00:04:46.166
is that my other monsters
can't attack this turn.

00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:50.600
You have 1,700
life points left.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.366
Prince Curry's just one
forkful away

00:04:52.366 --> 00:04:53.866
from finishing you off.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.866
Well, look at this!

00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:02.800
Ha.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.766
It's the perfect Action Card.

00:05:04.766 --> 00:05:07.133
This must be
my pot‐lucky day.

00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:09.433
Now, I activate...

00:05:09.433 --> 00:05:10.866
the Action Spell Victory
Topping!

00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:13.666
This spell bulks up
the attack points

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:16.000
of my Prince Curry by 600.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.200
Is that a...

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.666
Pork cutlet?

00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:23.400
♪

00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:28.366
This will add new meaning
to the saying "pig out."

00:05:28.366 --> 00:05:30.366
Now get ready
'cause my powered‐up prince

00:05:30.366 --> 00:05:31.466
is about to pounce!

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.333
If he lands that
attack, Yuya's toast!

00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:48.581
♪

00:05:50.181 --> 00:05:53.239
This will add new meaning
to the saying "pig out."

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:55.205
Now get ready 'cause
my powered‐up prince

00:05:55.205 --> 00:05:56.339
is about to pounce!

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:58.805
If he lands
that attack,

00:05:58.805 --> 00:06:00.639
Yuya's gonna be
in hot water!

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.072
Not so fast.

00:06:02.072 --> 00:06:04.905
I activate the trap
Performapal Call!

00:06:04.905 --> 00:06:06.739
Your Prince Curry
may be in a hurry

00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:08.505
but this stops him cold!

00:06:08.505 --> 00:06:09.872
And it also
lets me call

00:06:09.872 --> 00:06:11.839
a couple of Performapals
to join me

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.639
as long as their
defense points add up

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:14.972
to your Curry's
attack points.

00:06:16.805 --> 00:06:18.805
Prince Curry's got
1,800 attack points.

00:06:20.872 --> 00:06:22.705
So I get Performapal
Cheermole

00:06:22.705 --> 00:06:24.305
who's got
1,000 defense points

00:06:24.305 --> 00:06:27.239
and Performapal Turn Toad,
who has 800.

00:06:27.239 --> 00:06:29.239
You managed to stop
a direct attack

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:32.205
and add monsters to
your hand in one move.

00:06:32.205 --> 00:06:33.972
Grade‐A game play,
Yuya.

00:06:33.972 --> 00:06:35.872
But I'm not worried.

00:06:35.872 --> 00:06:37.639
I'll just drop
my tasty trap card

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.972
Canning Cuisine
into the mix.

00:06:39.972 --> 00:06:42.172
Since you added
two cards to your hand,

00:06:42.172 --> 00:06:45.505
I can put two Cookpals in my
deck into my Food Cemetery.

00:06:48.372 --> 00:06:50.872
I'm tossing out
Lionion and Rabbitomato.

00:06:56.739 --> 00:06:58.439
That Food Cemetery
again!

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:00.739
This is
a grave situation!

00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:03.605
Now, I activate
the spell Food Fraud.

00:07:03.605 --> 00:07:06.605
It lets me add two Royal
Cookpals to my hand.

00:07:06.605 --> 00:07:08.305
So I'll
bulk my hand up with

00:07:08.305 --> 00:07:10.505
Royal Cookpal King Burger

00:07:10.505 --> 00:07:13.239
and Royal Cookpal
Queen Omelet.

00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:16.105
I gotta admit your
hand's pretty tasty.

00:07:16.105 --> 00:07:19.305
Yes, but it'll leave
a bad taste in your mouth.

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:21.839
Too bad I can't summon
the monsters I added

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:23.205
to my hand this turn.

00:07:24.739 --> 00:07:27.839
Now that my turn's done,
Prince Curry's pork cutlet

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:31.072
exceeds its expiration date,
so he has to toss it out,

00:07:31.072 --> 00:07:33.339
so his attack
points return back to normal.

00:07:38.572 --> 00:07:41.772
(Yuya)
Next turn, Reed's gonna
have five Royal Cookpals.

00:07:41.772 --> 00:07:43.639
I've gotta do something
fast.

00:07:45.072 --> 00:07:46.072
I draw!

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:48.572
Great.

00:07:48.572 --> 00:07:50.439
This trap card
isn't gonna help me right now.

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:52.172
Only one thing to do.

00:07:52.172 --> 00:07:53.472
I gotta go for
an Action...

00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:54.705
(stomach rumbling)

00:07:54.705 --> 00:07:56.205
I'm so hungry.

00:07:56.205 --> 00:07:57.305
I'm too weak!

00:07:59.205 --> 00:08:01.039
(all gasping)

00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:02.505
(Yoko)
No wonder.

00:08:02.505 --> 00:08:04.872
It's like I tell you all
the time, Yuya.

00:08:04.872 --> 00:08:07.205
You can't duel a duel
if you don't have the fuel!

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:09.939
Mom!

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:11.272
What're you doing here?

00:08:11.272 --> 00:08:13.405
Just put some food
and some fire in your belly.

00:08:15.539 --> 00:08:18.372
You made your classic
pancakes for me!

00:08:18.372 --> 00:08:19.539
You're the best!

00:08:23.372 --> 00:08:24.439
Hey...

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:26.339
What'd you
stuff this with, Mom?

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.905
I combined the
Sunrise Pork Loaf Surprise

00:08:28.905 --> 00:08:30.672
with a pancake and made
it a sandwich.

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:35.805
Perfect.

00:08:35.805 --> 00:08:38.239
The pork's perfect because
I followed Reed's recipe.

00:08:38.239 --> 00:08:39.872
But when
I came up with the idea

00:08:39.872 --> 00:08:41.305
of putting it inside
a pancake

00:08:41.305 --> 00:08:42.772
and turning it
into a sandwich,

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:43.672
I made it even better.

00:08:44.972 --> 00:08:47.905
A Reed Pepper recipe can't
be made any better!

00:08:47.905 --> 00:08:51.039
Perfection...
made even better.

00:08:56.139 --> 00:08:58.905
Okay, I'm fueled
and ready for action!

00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:00.505
Thanks to
Stargazer Magician

00:09:00.505 --> 00:09:02.139
and Timegazer Magician,

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:03.805
the Pendulum Scale
has been set.

00:09:07.972 --> 00:09:10.405
I can summon monsters
from Level 2 through 7

00:09:10.405 --> 00:09:11.605
all at the same time!

00:09:11.605 --> 00:09:12.905
It's no use!

00:09:12.905 --> 00:09:15.005
As soon as Yuya summons them,
Reed'll destroy 'em!

00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:17.605
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:09:17.605 --> 00:09:19.439
Carve the arc of
victory!

00:09:21.439 --> 00:09:24.905
My monsters are
ready to swing into action!

00:09:28.072 --> 00:09:31.039
Let's hear it for
Performapal Cheermole.

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:33.039
Jump to it,
Performapal Turn Toad.

00:09:34.372 --> 00:09:37.039
I activate Royal Cookpal's
special ability,

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:38.872
Ballistic Belly Buster!

00:09:40.772 --> 00:09:42.405
I hope your
monsters are hungry

00:09:42.405 --> 00:09:44.105
because my Cookpals
are serving up

00:09:44.105 --> 00:09:46.139
an all‐you‐can‐eat buffet!

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:49.005
Wow, they look like they
had one bite too many!

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.272
(laughing)

00:09:50.272 --> 00:09:51.739
They're ready to pop!

00:09:51.739 --> 00:09:53.405
And that's just
what they'll do

00:09:53.405 --> 00:09:55.039
when I return
Knight Pasta

00:09:55.039 --> 00:09:56.272
and Princess Pudding
to my hand!

00:10:00.572 --> 00:10:02.872
At least they
didn't go away hungry.

00:10:02.872 --> 00:10:03.939
He thinks
destroying monsters

00:10:03.939 --> 00:10:05.505
is something to
joke about.

00:10:05.505 --> 00:10:06.705
How tasteless!

00:10:06.705 --> 00:10:08.172
You're rotten
to the core!

00:10:08.172 --> 00:10:09.205
(laughing)

00:10:11.139 --> 00:10:13.339
Pendulum Monsters
don't go to my graveyard,

00:10:13.339 --> 00:10:14.639
they go to my
Extra Deck.

00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:18.505
All right.

00:10:18.505 --> 00:10:20.005
It's your
turn now, Reed.

00:10:21.005 --> 00:10:22.005
So dish it out!

00:10:33.992 --> 00:10:35.225
♪

00:10:35.225 --> 00:10:37.625
Frightfur Bear, attack
with Pummeling Paw!

00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:39.092
(laughing maniacally)

00:10:41.625 --> 00:10:43.125
(yelling)

00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:48.692
Who knew...
teddy bears were so vicious?

00:10:50.225 --> 00:10:51.492
Yeah, all right!

00:10:53.059 --> 00:10:54.692
Two wins
in a row, Zuzu!

00:10:56.259 --> 00:10:57.525
Hey, you're not even
watching me.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:00.392
Sorry, Sora.

00:11:00.392 --> 00:11:02.059
I spaced out
for a second.

00:11:03.425 --> 00:11:04.359
Aw...

00:11:05.659 --> 00:11:07.659
Let's get cooking!

00:11:09.292 --> 00:11:12.625
So, you think you made one
of my recipes even better.

00:11:12.625 --> 00:11:13.625
Is that right?

00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:15.025
Well, yes, but...

00:11:15.025 --> 00:11:16.859
All my recipes are perfect.

00:11:16.859 --> 00:11:19.325
In fact, everything
I do is perfect.

00:11:19.325 --> 00:11:21.225
There's no way to
improve on perfection.

00:11:21.225 --> 00:11:22.592
That's right!

00:11:22.592 --> 00:11:25.292
No one can do anything better
than my Reed!

00:11:25.292 --> 00:11:26.692
Thanks, Mom.

00:11:26.692 --> 00:11:28.459
I've got five cards
in my Food Cemetery!

00:11:29.925 --> 00:11:32.092
Using the power of
Regal Recipes,

00:11:32.092 --> 00:11:34.359
I'm putting four Royal
Cookpals back on the menu...

00:11:38.492 --> 00:11:40.025
... Royal Cookpal King Burger,

00:11:41.292 --> 00:11:43.225
Queen Omelet,

00:11:43.225 --> 00:11:45.125
Princess Pudding
and Knight Pasta!

00:11:47.425 --> 00:11:49.192
That's one
super‐sized meal.

00:11:49.192 --> 00:11:50.692
I hope I can get
through it.

00:11:50.692 --> 00:11:54.192
(Frederick)
Curry, burger,
omelet und pasta!

00:11:54.192 --> 00:11:55.825
(Allie)
Don't forget pudding.

00:11:55.825 --> 00:11:58.859
If mein eyes were mouths
I'd be stuffed already!

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:03.559
For starters, you take
300 points of damage

00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:04.759
for every
monster I summoned.

00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:13.359
Yuya!

00:12:13.359 --> 00:12:15.592
The boy did
the very best that he could,

00:12:15.592 --> 00:12:18.492
but going up against five
Royal Cookpals

00:12:18.492 --> 00:12:20.292
was more than
he could swallow.

00:12:20.292 --> 00:12:22.959
Knight Pasta's special
ability activates,

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:25.092
so I think I'll
double the attack points

00:12:25.092 --> 00:12:27.525
of my Royal Cookpal
Prince Curry.

00:12:30.459 --> 00:12:32.659
Now, Princess Pudding's
special ability

00:12:32.659 --> 00:12:34.059
doubles
it up once again!

00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:41.325
Her Eggs‐elency
Queen Omelet's

00:12:41.325 --> 00:12:43.059
special ability
does the same.

00:12:46.325 --> 00:12:48.859
Royal Cookpal King Burger
beefs things up, too.

00:12:53.592 --> 00:12:55.259
(Tate)
4,800 attack points!

00:12:55.259 --> 00:12:56.659
It's bursting with
calories!

00:12:57.992 --> 00:12:59.425
Platters up!

00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:01.925
Now, Prince Curry,
attack Yuya directly!

00:13:03.025 --> 00:13:05.192
Feel the fury of
the golden, royal curry!

00:13:08.692 --> 00:13:10.359
A tornado of...

00:13:10.359 --> 00:13:11.525
Curry!
Curry!

00:13:11.525 --> 00:13:13.425
It won't get me,

00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:16.625
'cause I play the trap
Wall of Disruption!

00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:19.792
Your Prince Curry gets cut
down to 800 attack points!

00:13:19.792 --> 00:13:21.059
Chew on that, Reed!

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:24.092
Oh, is that so?

00:13:24.092 --> 00:13:26.925
800 points times
five monsters...

00:13:26.925 --> 00:13:29.225
that's 4,000
attack points gone.

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:35.892
Too bad you only have
500 life points.

00:13:35.892 --> 00:13:37.992
Prince Curry's got
more than enough leftovers

00:13:37.992 --> 00:13:39.159
to wipe you out
for good.

00:13:49.092 --> 00:13:50.025
(all gasping)

00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:58.125
I'll give him credit.

00:13:58.125 --> 00:14:00.092
He was tougher
than I expected.

00:14:00.092 --> 00:14:02.092
But after all is dueled
and done,

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:04.025
Yuya got his
just desserts.

00:14:05.392 --> 00:14:06.759
(woman)
What's happening?

00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:08.392
(woman)
Amazing duel!
(woman)
What's going on?

00:14:08.392 --> 00:14:10.459
(woman)
Well, he sure showed him
who's king of the kitchen.

00:14:10.459 --> 00:14:12.292
(woman)
Look!
(woman)
It's the kid!

00:14:12.292 --> 00:14:14.392
(woman)
He's still standing!
(woman)
He's still got life points!

00:14:14.392 --> 00:14:15.659
Yuya's not down!

00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:18.559
No way!

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:20.292
How can
you still be...

00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:21.692
I wiped out all your
life points!

00:14:23.192 --> 00:14:24.859
Luckily,
I used an Action Card...

00:14:26.459 --> 00:14:27.825
... the one I couldn't
get last time.

00:14:29.225 --> 00:14:31.392
It was the Action Spell
Energy Biscuits.

00:14:32.925 --> 00:14:35.425
It gave me
500 more life points,

00:14:35.425 --> 00:14:37.125
just enough to survive
your attack.

00:14:41.725 --> 00:14:42.759
With my belly full,

00:14:42.759 --> 00:14:43.959
I had enough bounce
in my step

00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:45.492
to grab
the card this time.

00:14:47.392 --> 00:14:48.459
I end my turn

00:14:48.459 --> 00:14:51.125
so Prince Curry's attack
points return to normal.

00:14:55.759 --> 00:14:58.059
But I wouldn't be too
comfortable, Yuya.

00:14:58.059 --> 00:14:59.859
You don't have
any cards in your hand,

00:14:59.859 --> 00:15:03.192
so how do you expect to beat
five Royal Cookpals?

00:15:03.192 --> 00:15:04.525
You'll find out!

00:15:05.692 --> 00:15:07.325
I prepared
as best I could.

00:15:07.325 --> 00:15:09.192
Now I just have to get
the right card.

00:15:20.392 --> 00:15:22.459
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:15:23.992 --> 00:15:25.659
... it's my pleasure
to present to you

00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:27.492
the grand finale!

00:15:27.492 --> 00:15:30.125
He's taken over
my kitchen...

00:15:30.125 --> 00:15:32.459
Scale 1 Stargazer Magician

00:15:32.459 --> 00:15:34.525
and Scale 8
Timegazer Magician

00:15:34.525 --> 00:15:36.159
are already in
their places!

00:15:37.159 --> 00:15:38.425
Thanks to them,

00:15:38.425 --> 00:15:40.159
I'm allowed to summon
monsters from Level 2

00:15:40.159 --> 00:15:41.692
through 7 all
at the same time!

00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:44.625
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:15:44.625 --> 00:15:46.392
Carve the arc of
victory!

00:15:48.359 --> 00:15:49.759
My monsters
are ready...

00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:51.625
to swing into action!

00:15:53.392 --> 00:15:54.992
Who cares if you can
Pendulum Summon

00:15:54.992 --> 00:15:56.725
lots of monsters at once?

00:15:56.725 --> 00:15:58.559
My Royal Cookpals
will destroy 'em

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:00.125
like they did before!

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:01.492
Please,
watch closely!

00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:04.225
Before your very eyes,

00:16:04.225 --> 00:16:06.725
without the use of
smoke or mirrors,

00:16:06.725 --> 00:16:08.425
I will conjure up
the Pendulum Monsters

00:16:08.425 --> 00:16:10.259
from my Extra Deck!

00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:11.459
What do you mean
"Extra Deck"?

00:16:19.492 --> 00:16:21.259
Jump to it,
Performapal Turn Toad!

turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:16:51.371 --> 00:16:52.604
♪

00:16:52.604 --> 00:16:53.971
(Yuya)
Now the gang's
all here.

00:16:57.004 --> 00:16:59.338
Goose pickle time!

00:16:59.338 --> 00:17:00.971
Yuya's got
five monsters!

00:17:00.971 --> 00:17:02.671
Yuya planned it
perfectly!

00:17:02.671 --> 00:17:05.504
Destroyed Pendulum Monsters
go to the Extra Deck!

00:17:05.504 --> 00:17:06.771
So he set it up

00:17:06.771 --> 00:17:09.004
so that he can summon
five monsters at once!

00:17:11.271 --> 00:17:14.971
Yuya began with the perfect
recipe and made it even better.

00:17:14.971 --> 00:17:17.438
Your plan can't
cut the mustard!

00:17:17.438 --> 00:17:20.304
Summon whatever you want,
it won't change anything!

00:17:20.304 --> 00:17:23.771
'Cause I'm going to destroy
them all like last time!

00:17:23.771 --> 00:17:24.971
Take a taste of my five

00:17:24.971 --> 00:17:26.838
Royal Cookpals'
special abilities!

00:17:31.771 --> 00:17:34.104
They'll be
destroyed like last time!

00:17:34.104 --> 00:17:36.671
For each Royal Cookpal
I return to my hand,

00:17:36.671 --> 00:17:39.138
one of your
monsters is destroyed!

00:17:40.538 --> 00:17:42.804
Well, Yuya, all your
monsters bit the dust.

00:17:44.138 --> 00:17:45.804
That's just what
I was waiting for!

00:17:45.804 --> 00:17:46.971
Just what?

00:17:46.971 --> 00:17:50.704
I activate the spell card
Illusion Balloons!

00:17:50.704 --> 00:17:52.938
I take the same
number of cards in my deck

00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:54.838
as the number of monsters
that were destroyed.

00:17:56.138 --> 00:17:57.204
That's freaky.

00:17:57.204 --> 00:17:58.538
Und tasty!

00:17:59.538 --> 00:18:01.004
I direct your attention

00:18:01.004 --> 00:18:04.304
to these five floating
pork pancake sandwiches.

00:18:04.304 --> 00:18:05.971
Thanks to Illusion Balloons,

00:18:05.971 --> 00:18:08.471
these five delicious
pancake sandwiches

00:18:08.471 --> 00:18:10.571
have been stuffed with
the top five cards

00:18:10.571 --> 00:18:11.704
from my deck!

00:18:11.704 --> 00:18:13.104
I get to
look at 'em all

00:18:13.104 --> 00:18:16.104
and summon the Performapal
with the highest level.

00:18:16.104 --> 00:18:17.538
Good show!

00:18:17.538 --> 00:18:19.104
Yuya summoned five monsters

00:18:19.104 --> 00:18:20.571
knowing all
would be destroyed,

00:18:20.571 --> 00:18:21.904
yet that calamitous
combination

00:18:21.904 --> 00:18:23.271
was the catalyst
that could lead

00:18:23.271 --> 00:18:24.904
to a commanding conquest!

00:18:24.904 --> 00:18:28.638
But if he doesn't pull
a powerful monster, Yuya loses.

00:18:28.638 --> 00:18:30.904
You can rely on luck
if you want to, Yuya,

00:18:30.904 --> 00:18:33.804
but I rely on perfection
to win my duels!

00:18:33.804 --> 00:18:36.871
The more skill you have,
the more luck you have!

00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:38.771
Now I'll prove it!

00:18:38.771 --> 00:18:39.904
Let's see if there's
a winning card

00:18:39.904 --> 00:18:41.838
inside these pancakes.

00:18:41.838 --> 00:18:43.004
The first card
is...

00:18:46.404 --> 00:18:47.904
(buzzing)

00:18:47.904 --> 00:18:50.271
Aww,
not what I wanted.

00:18:50.271 --> 00:18:53.204
A spell card doesn't do
me any good right now.

00:18:53.204 --> 00:18:55.104
(all groaning)

00:18:55.104 --> 00:18:56.638
Here comes
number two!

00:18:59.038 --> 00:19:00.038
All right!

00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:01.838
Hip Hippo!

00:19:01.838 --> 00:19:04.004
It won't do him
a bit of good.

00:19:04.004 --> 00:19:06.238
That monster's much
too weak to beat my Reed!

00:19:06.238 --> 00:19:07.371
Number three!

00:19:08.471 --> 00:19:09.804
(buzzing)

00:19:09.804 --> 00:19:11.271
(woman)
It's not a monster!

00:19:11.271 --> 00:19:13.338
(woman)
He's only got
two chances left!

00:19:13.338 --> 00:19:14.471
(Yuya)
Come on, four!

00:19:16.604 --> 00:19:18.438
Even though it's
a Performapal, it won't do.

00:19:19.671 --> 00:19:21.538
Obviously, Yuya just
missed by a mule.

00:19:21.538 --> 00:19:22.704
It's awful.

00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:24.204
It's awful?

00:19:24.204 --> 00:19:25.871
I meant awesome!

00:19:25.871 --> 00:19:26.871
One more.

00:19:26.871 --> 00:19:28.638
Yuya has
one card left.

00:19:28.638 --> 00:19:30.771
(woman)
I came to see
Reed Pepper cook,

00:19:30.771 --> 00:19:32.838
but this is even
more exciting!

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:34.271
(woman)
I can't wait to
see what it'll be!

00:19:34.271 --> 00:19:35.638
(woman)
Go, Yuya!

00:19:35.638 --> 00:19:38.204
(woman)
You can cut the tension
with a kitchen knife!

00:19:39.938 --> 00:19:41.071
Ladies...

00:19:41.071 --> 00:19:43.871
the time has come to
flip the final pancake!

00:19:43.871 --> 00:19:46.138
It's make or break time
for me!

00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:48.304
Feast or famine!

00:19:48.304 --> 00:19:50.238
Let's see
what it's gonna be!

00:19:50.238 --> 00:19:51.138
Number five!

00:19:54.504 --> 00:19:55.804
Bingo!

00:19:55.804 --> 00:19:58.271
A High Level Performapal!

00:19:58.271 --> 00:20:00.338
Last doesn't
mean least!

00:20:00.338 --> 00:20:01.804
I summon...

00:20:01.804 --> 00:20:04.238
Level 6 Performapal
Elephammer!

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:07.671
It's showtime, Elephammer.

00:20:07.671 --> 00:20:09.871
Time to show this crowd
how you shake things up.

00:20:19.338 --> 00:20:21.504
2,600 attack points?

00:20:21.504 --> 00:20:23.604
That...
that means I'm done.

00:20:23.604 --> 00:20:25.271
And my recipe...

00:20:25.271 --> 00:20:27.304
my perfect recipe
is ruined!

00:20:27.304 --> 00:20:29.504
There's no such thing
as a perfect recipe.

00:20:33.004 --> 00:20:35.538
Every great chef
learns a hard truth.

00:20:35.538 --> 00:20:36.938
My boy...

00:20:36.938 --> 00:20:40.804
"perfect recipe" cannot be set
in stone and never change.

00:20:40.804 --> 00:20:42.738
You must constantly
work to make it better.

00:20:45.138 --> 00:20:47.104
Why didn't
I listen to my dad?

00:20:47.104 --> 00:20:48.538
Let's battle.

00:20:48.538 --> 00:20:51.471
Performapal Elephammer,
attack Reed directly!

00:20:56.471 --> 00:20:57.671
(Reed)
It's time.

00:20:57.671 --> 00:20:58.971
Check, please.

00:21:05.838 --> 00:21:07.138
Hooray!

00:21:07.138 --> 00:21:08.471
He got his first win!

00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:11.171
Wunderbar!

00:21:11.171 --> 00:21:12.671
Thanks for
a delish duel, Reed.

00:21:16.004 --> 00:21:17.138
(Matilda)
Reed!

00:21:17.138 --> 00:21:18.638
What happened?
Huh?

00:21:18.638 --> 00:21:20.738
Oh, I never imagined
you could lose

00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:22.771
with your
perfect recipe!

00:21:22.771 --> 00:21:26.338
Mama, we could both
use more imagination.

00:21:26.338 --> 00:21:27.804
I guess you're right.

00:21:27.804 --> 00:21:29.404
Hey, Yuya!
Great job, Yuya!

00:21:29.404 --> 00:21:30.471
You did it!

00:21:30.471 --> 00:21:32.204
Goosepickles!

00:21:32.204 --> 00:21:33.504
(Reed)
Well, Yuya...

00:21:34.871 --> 00:21:37.104
My congratulations.

00:21:37.104 --> 00:21:38.771
And I've learned
my lesson.

00:21:38.771 --> 00:21:41.104
There's no such
thing as the perfect recipe,

00:21:41.104 --> 00:21:42.938
in cooking or dueling.

00:21:42.938 --> 00:21:45.704
So I'll keep trying new
ingredients and techniques

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:47.304
and do better
next time.

00:21:47.304 --> 00:21:49.871
I better start prepping
for the Championship.

00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:51.171
I hope you
make it in.

00:21:52.738 --> 00:21:54.004
Thanks.

00:21:54.004 --> 00:21:55.204
(stomach growling)

00:21:56.604 --> 00:21:59.438
It sounds like dueling
worked up your appetite.

00:21:59.438 --> 00:22:01.471
How about a pancake
sandwich?

00:22:01.471 --> 00:22:03.904
I think I might have
a better idea.

00:22:03.904 --> 00:22:06.771
I think I have a way
to improve your recipe.

00:22:06.771 --> 00:22:08.104
Sounds good.

00:22:08.104 --> 00:22:09.338
I'm starving.

00:22:09.338 --> 00:22:12.771
Reed Pepper's gonna use my
pancake sandwich recipe!

00:22:12.771 --> 00:22:14.004
Hooray!

00:22:14.004 --> 00:22:15.304
I'm a star!

00:22:15.304 --> 00:22:16.471
I'm a star!

00:22:16.471 --> 00:22:17.338
I can't believe it!

00:22:17.338 --> 00:22:18.404
Woo‐hoo!

00:22:20.038 --> 00:22:21.104
Embarrassing.

00:23:30.171 --> 00:23:33.671
