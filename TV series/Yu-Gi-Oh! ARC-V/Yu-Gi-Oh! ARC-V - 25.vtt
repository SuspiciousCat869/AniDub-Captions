00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.666
(Yuya)
Previously on "YugiOh Arc‐V"...

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:08.400
You're the one who attacked
Professor Marco, aren't you?

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.200
Challenge me to a duel,
then maybe you'll know

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.766
if I'm your guy or not.

00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.233
We'll use
Battle Royal rules.

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:19.566
Which means the three of us get
the chance to take you on!

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.700
(all)
Let's Duel!

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.933
(Zuzu)
Are you telling me you
can't guarantee my safety

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.166
if I try to stop your
pals duel with Julia?

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.800
Is that some sort
of threat?

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.366
Who are you guys?

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.866
What do you want?

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.666
We have enemies Zuzu.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.733
And a friend of ours
was taken by them....

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.566
Hold on, are you
talking about Lulu?

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.600
Raidraptor Rise‐Falcon
will finish you all

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:46.066
(screaming)

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.833
(Yuto)
You say you're trying
to protect your friends?

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:54.066
So are we.

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.833
We're fighting for
our people...

00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:56.966
For Lulu...

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.900
She's my
colleague's sister.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.966
His name is Shay.

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:06.466
My name is...
Yuto.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.966
(Claude)
We've got
you surrounded.

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.166
There's nowhere
to run.

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.000
Where is your master?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.166

So who are you?

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:34.000
Declan Akaba.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.566
The current president
of Leo Corporation.

00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:39.900
Akaba.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.833
I know that name.

00:02:41.833 --> 00:02:45.366
Well did you know that
Leo Corporation controls LID?

00:02:45.366 --> 00:02:47.800
I'm betting you did and
that's the reason why

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.033
you've been attacking all those
connected with the Institute.

00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:54.200
You knew those events
would get my attention.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.633
And, you've got it.

00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:58.466
Declan Akaba.

00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:01.133
Leo Akaba's son.

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:03.366
I've waited a
long time to meet you.

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:05.266
Let's not wait
any longer!

00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:06.866
It's time!

00:03:06.866 --> 00:03:09.966
It's time to take
you down Declan!

00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:11.266
You can barely
contain yourself!

00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:16.266
Why is battling me
so important to you?

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:18.600
I don't have to
tell you anything!

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.800
My guess is you think it'll
help you rescue your friend.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.966
I believe her
name was Lulu...

00:03:25.966 --> 00:03:28.266
Julia filled me in
on the details

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:30.666
about how she ran into
you down at the harbor.

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:34.066
Lulu!

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:36.666
How did you...

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:37.866
Who helped you?

00:03:37.866 --> 00:03:39.633
Did you get away?

00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:42.333
You thought that you had
found your dear lost friend,

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:44.800
but it was a case of
mistaken identity.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.600
I think Lulu is being
held prisoner by your enemies,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.300
and the fact that you brought
up my father's name

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.066
must mean that he
is the enemy you seek.

00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:54.400
You want to use me as some
sort of bargaining chip,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.233
so that's why you
continued to attack my students,

00:03:57.233 --> 00:03:59.700
to get my attention and draw
me out into the open

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.466
so that you
can capture me.

00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:04.566
That leads me to believe Lulu's
pretty close to you,

00:04:04.566 --> 00:04:05.833
and to your
masked friend.

00:04:07.466 --> 00:04:09.366
(Yuto)
That wasn't Lulu.

00:04:09.366 --> 00:04:10.800
It can't be because
your sister

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.800
would never use
Fusion Summoning.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.533
Lulu's still be being
held captive.

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:18.933
We've got to rescue her.

00:04:18.933 --> 00:04:22.000
Shay, you have to keep doing
whatever it takes to free her...

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.433
Nothing is off limits.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.633
You're right,
Declan.

00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:31.633
Your despicable
father has Lulu

00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:35.166
and I'll do anything and
everything to get her back.

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:36.633
And that includes...

00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:39.100
using you as bait!

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.066
Then it's just
as I thought.

00:04:41.066 --> 00:04:43.633
You propose a kind
of """prisoner exchange."

00:04:43.633 --> 00:04:45.933
Me... for her.

00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:47.366
That's correct.

00:04:47.366 --> 00:04:48.966
I'm gonna
trade you for Lulu

00:04:48.966 --> 00:04:52.633
because that's one offer
Leo Akaba won't refuse!

00:04:52.633 --> 00:04:54.633
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:04:54.633 --> 00:04:55.933
What?

00:04:55.933 --> 00:04:57.800
I think you're seriously
overestimating

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.933
my father's
interest in my welfare.

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:02.500
What do you mean?

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.033
Nothing.

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:08.266
If you want to battle, I
have no objection to doing so.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.300
But I have one
condition.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.433
And what's that?

00:05:12.433 --> 00:05:17.333
If you do exactly what I ask
and if you do it successfully,

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:18.733
then I'll agree to
be your opponent.

00:05:20.633 --> 00:05:22.433
And if by some
chance you win...

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.733
You may do whatever
you like with me.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.933
♪

00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:39.433
(Zuzu)
Julia!

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.933
Where are you?

00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:47.266
(crows cawing)

00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:06.533
(Nico Smiley)
Yuya, in your last
three battles,

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.466
you've shown
exceptional progress,

00:06:08.466 --> 00:06:11.133
just as I anticipated.

00:06:11.133 --> 00:06:13.866
In the first battle, you learned
that there is no such thing

00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:18.033
as the perfect recipe,
in cooking or in dueling!

00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:20.200
Adapting to each specific
situation

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.733
is absolutely
essential for success!

00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:26.366
Your second match, against
the Quiz Whiz,

00:06:26.366 --> 00:06:27.966
taught you
the valuable lesson

00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:30.433
that your mind is your most
important weapon.

00:06:33.366 --> 00:06:34.866
And in the third battle,

00:06:34.866 --> 00:06:37.400
you were able to
shock and surprise me

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.733
and your audience with
the kind of passion

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:42.600
that finally
exceeded my expectations.

00:06:44.933 --> 00:06:47.200
So far, you have
transformed your technique,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.066
but what you do next could
transform your life!

00:06:50.066 --> 00:06:52.300
The upcoming battle
will be the final one

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.433
in my sensational series!

00:06:54.433 --> 00:06:56.600
Yuya,
if you win the match,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.533
it will be your 30th victory
in 50 matches,

00:06:59.533 --> 00:07:02.466
a 60% success rate,
which is the minimum you need

00:07:02.466 --> 00:07:05.233
to enter the Junior Arc
League Championship!

00:07:05.233 --> 00:07:06.500
If there
were ever a time

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.600
to use all the skills
you've learned,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.366
this is it!

00:07:10.366 --> 00:07:13.400
'Cause If you want to
become a pro, you need to win!

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.966
(Yuya)
Nico's right.

00:07:16.966 --> 00:07:19.533
My whole future depends
on this duel.

00:07:19.533 --> 00:07:22.133
It doesn't matter
who my opponent is.

00:07:22.133 --> 00:07:25.266
I believe in dueltaining and
I believe in myself.

00:07:28.233 --> 00:07:31.000
Today's my big day Mom,
an' there's no better way

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.200
to kick off a big day
than with a big stack

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.733
o' your awesome pancakes!
Mom?

00:07:36.733 --> 00:07:38.166
That's funny.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.700
Where could
she be?

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.000
Not in here.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.233
Mom!

00:07:42.233 --> 00:07:43.633
Mom?

00:07:43.633 --> 00:07:46.433
Weird.

00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:48.866
Not here, or here!

00:07:48.866 --> 00:07:50.666
Unbelievable.

00:07:50.666 --> 00:07:52.700
Mom's gone and even
Sora's not here,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.433
and he's always
here to eat my pancakes.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.566
Where is everybody?

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.866
It's the most important day
of your son's life,

00:08:08.866 --> 00:08:10.900
and you leave me high
and dry with nothing to eat

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.066
but a week old mystery
muffin.

00:08:13.066 --> 00:08:15.133
Least my
friends got my back.

00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:16.433
What the...

00:08:16.433 --> 00:08:18.000
Where's Principal
Boyle?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.400
And Zuzu?

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.300
If this is a joke,
it's not funny.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.666
Come on out, Tate!

00:08:23.666 --> 00:08:24.666
Frederick!

00:08:24.666 --> 00:08:25.733
Allie!

00:08:25.733 --> 00:08:26.666
Joke's over!

00:08:28.366 --> 00:08:31.466
Nobody at home and
now nobody at school either?

00:08:31.466 --> 00:08:34.166
Man, I wish I could see
a friendly face!

00:08:34.166 --> 00:08:37.033
(Nico Smiley)
Ahh, there he is!

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:38.733
Not what I
was thinking.

00:08:38.733 --> 00:08:41.200
A gracious morning,
young Yuya.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.400
I trust you are
prepared for the duel today.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.466
Never mind that,
where is everybody?

00:08:45.466 --> 00:08:46.733
You seem rather
concerned.

00:08:46.733 --> 00:08:47.800
Yes, I am!

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.166
What's going
on here?

00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:51.100
Oh my, look at
what time it is!

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.233
We mustn't be late for
your big battle!

00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:55.633
Your audience
awaits, Yuya!

00:08:55.633 --> 00:08:57.866
Nico, you didn't
answer me!

00:08:57.866 --> 00:08:59.266
Where is everybody?

00:09:00.433 --> 00:09:01.566
Going down!
We're late!

00:09:01.566 --> 00:09:03.700
Come on, it'll take you
three seconds to tell me!

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.633
Nope!

00:09:04.633 --> 00:09:05.700
Please?

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.100
Nope!

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.866
Nico, my next battle isn't
against who I think it is,

00:09:09.866 --> 00:09:11.033
is it?

00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:14.100
Well, Yuya, there's
only one way to find out.

00:09:15.766 --> 00:09:17.100
What took you
so long?

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.900
Gong's
been waiting!

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.000
I don't understand,
I've already battled Gong

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.800
tons of times before.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.266
What's it gonna prove if
I battle him again now?

00:09:25.266 --> 00:09:27.700
While it's true you have
battled Gong in the past,

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.166
you have never had so much at
stake on a single duel.

00:09:32.166 --> 00:09:34.500
Yuya, I am aware
that you and Gong

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.000
have a very special
relationship.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.266
When your famous father,
Yusho Sakaki,

00:09:39.266 --> 00:09:41.766
suddenly disappeared before
the big championship match

00:09:41.766 --> 00:09:43.833
and you were ridiculed
because of his actions,

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:48.233
Gong was the one who stood
by you and protected you.

00:09:48.233 --> 00:09:51.566
Every time I think about
his kindness and compassion,

00:09:51.566 --> 00:09:53.766
I cannot help but be
profoundly moved

00:09:53.766 --> 00:09:55.933
by your beautiful
friendship.

00:09:55.933 --> 00:09:58.766
But, you must
forget your friendship!

00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:02.366
If you want become a pro, your
must treat Gong as your enemy!

00:10:02.366 --> 00:10:03.500
(Gong)
He's right, Yuya.

00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:08.433
You and Gong battled each other
plenty of times before,

00:10:08.433 --> 00:10:11.666
but those matches were
for training, or for fun,

00:10:11.666 --> 00:10:14.233
and in the back of
Gong's mind,

00:10:14.233 --> 00:10:16.433
Gong was always
thinking about how hurt you were

00:10:16.433 --> 00:10:18.333
after your daddy
disappeared,

00:10:18.333 --> 00:10:21.033
so Gong always went
kind of easy on you.

00:10:21.033 --> 00:10:24.900
But now, Gong realizes what all
that holdin' back did to Gong!

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.466
It made Gong into somebody
who didn't have the heart

00:10:27.466 --> 00:10:29.566
to be a real winner!

00:10:29.566 --> 00:10:31.133
You're saying
it's my fault

00:10:31.133 --> 00:10:32.900
that you're not the
best duelist you...

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.300
can be?

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.666
Mm‐hmm.

00:10:35.666 --> 00:10:38.166
Like Gong's battle with
that Leo Institute kid.

00:10:38.166 --> 00:10:40.933
The match was all tied up
at one win a piece.

00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:43.300
But Gong just
couldn't win that final duel.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.200
Gong, you tied
it though.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.666
There's no difference
between tying and losing.

00:10:48.666 --> 00:10:50.600
It feels like Gong
lost that match

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.066
'cause Gong didn't
have the heart to win it.

00:10:53.066 --> 00:10:55.566
Gong got soft, too used
to holding back.

00:10:55.566 --> 00:10:59.466
So now, Gong's gotta get
tough, especially with myself!

00:10:59.466 --> 00:11:03.033
In fact, Gong is so dedicated to
getting tough with himself

00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:04.533
that he's
managed to back himself

00:11:04.533 --> 00:11:06.066
into the proverbial
corner

00:11:06.066 --> 00:11:09.100
regarding the Junior
Arc League Championship.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.166
Gong needs one
more win.

00:11:11.166 --> 00:11:13.033
With that one
victory under his belt,

00:11:13.033 --> 00:11:15.833
he will reach the required
60% win rate,

00:11:15.833 --> 00:11:18.466
yet he refused challenges
from any other duelists

00:11:18.466 --> 00:11:20.633
until you were
in the same position!

00:11:22.433 --> 00:11:24.633
As you know, you will also
enter the tournament

00:11:24.633 --> 00:11:26.033
if you win your next match!

00:11:26.033 --> 00:11:28.066
Which is something
we both want‐‐ right?

00:11:28.066 --> 00:11:29.366
Of course it is!

00:11:29.366 --> 00:11:31.300
That means only
the duelist who wins this battle

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.966
will be guaranteed a spot in the
Junior Arc League Championship!

00:11:34.966 --> 00:11:36.166
Nico!
What?

00:11:36.166 --> 00:11:37.533
How could you
let him do this?

00:11:37.533 --> 00:11:39.433
He didn't force Gong
to do nothing!

00:11:39.433 --> 00:11:40.933
Gong had to prove
Gong's self,

00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:44.066
that Gong could have a
serious match with you.

00:11:44.066 --> 00:11:47.033
Gong's gonna be the next
leader of this duel dojo.

00:11:47.033 --> 00:11:49.300
This battle's gotta prove
the Heavystrong Duel Style

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.166
can really cut
the mustard!

00:11:51.166 --> 00:11:52.933
Gong's going
all out, pal!

00:11:52.933 --> 00:11:55.200
Gong's gonna do everything
in Gong's power

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.033
to splat you like
an itty bitty June bug!

00:12:08.266 --> 00:12:10.800
(childe)
Hey look, it's
the scaredy cat's kid!

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.666
(child)
You're right,
Yusho Sakaki's son!

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:15.533
(child)
Can't believe he's
showing his face around here

00:12:15.533 --> 00:12:17.933
after his dad ran away
from the Sledgehammer.

00:12:17.933 --> 00:12:21.666
He's been telling everyone he's
gonna duel in his dad's place.

00:12:21.666 --> 00:12:23.333
(laughing)

00:12:35.966 --> 00:12:37.633
(gasping)

00:12:37.633 --> 00:12:40.366
So you're gonna battle for
your father, are you?

00:12:40.366 --> 00:12:42.833
Then how 'bout I take
The Sledgehammer's place!

00:12:42.833 --> 00:12:44.300
Let's go,
big shot.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.966
On your feet!

00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:49.100
Well, what're you
waitin' for, kid?

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.100
Are you gonna stand up
an' duel like a man,

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.233
or y' gonna fly the coop
like your chicken dad did?

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:57.000
Back off Grizzlepike!

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.933
That's enough!

00:12:59.533 --> 00:13:01.900
You think it makes you bigger
or stronger or cooler

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.766
to pick on somebody
that's smaller than you are?

00:13:04.766 --> 00:13:07.266
Don't you know that picking on
people goes against everything

00:13:07.266 --> 00:13:09.000
our Dojo stands for?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.600
You got me
wrong, Gong.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.700
I ain't pickin'
on the kid.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.100
I just asked him to
duel, so we could find out

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.133
whose style is
the best...

00:13:17.133 --> 00:13:19.133
he was gonna
dueltain like his dad

00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:21.133
and I was gonna be
the Sledgehammer.

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:22.900
Listen pal, our dojo
ain't teaching you

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.933
the Heavystrong
style so you can go 'round

00:13:24.933 --> 00:13:26.800
threatening kids
with it!

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.500
I catch you messing
with this boy again

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.200
you're expelled on
the spot.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.766
Doesn't matter what
the reason, or who you are.

00:13:34.233 --> 00:13:37.133
Thank you, Gong.

00:13:37.133 --> 00:13:40.633
(Nico Smiley)
You still seem to be waging
an internal battle, Yuya.

00:13:40.633 --> 00:13:42.000
I can understand.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.766
If you are able
to defeat the man

00:13:43.766 --> 00:13:45.700
who has been your loyal
protector,

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.166
you will prevent
him from entering

00:13:47.166 --> 00:13:48.733
the Junior Arc League
Championship.

00:13:51.833 --> 00:13:54.600
I also sense that you
are uneasy about this battle

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.166
for another reason.

00:13:56.166 --> 00:13:59.000
So far, you have been encouraged
by Gong and many others.

00:14:00.433 --> 00:14:02.166
Winning is easier
when you are cheered on

00:14:02.166 --> 00:14:04.733
by fans, friends
and family!

00:14:04.733 --> 00:14:07.733
You gained strength from
their enthusiastic support

00:14:07.733 --> 00:14:11.200
and their loving
admiration.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.266
(Yuya)
Whoa.

00:14:12.266 --> 00:14:14.233
He's like
reading my mind!

00:14:14.233 --> 00:14:17.200
But professionals must
also battle far from home.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.333
A pro must be able to
triumph alone.

00:14:20.333 --> 00:14:22.233
I have forbidden
your cheering section

00:14:22.233 --> 00:14:23.833
from attending this
crucial match

00:14:23.833 --> 00:14:25.666
to see if you
can win on your own.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.033
Gong won't
hold back.

00:14:30.033 --> 00:14:33.366
Yuya can't either
if he wants to be a pro.

00:14:33.366 --> 00:14:36.133
Friend against
friend.

00:14:36.133 --> 00:14:37.933
Now that I got
that out of the way,

00:14:37.933 --> 00:14:39.333
I give you Sensei Strong.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.833
When two duelists clash,
the force of their collision

00:14:44.833 --> 00:14:47.833
burnishes character
and polishes souls.

00:14:47.833 --> 00:14:49.700
A character
that is unshakeable.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:54.333
a soul that stands strong: this
is the way of the Duel Dojo.

00:14:54.333 --> 00:14:56.166
You must spar unbound.

00:14:56.166 --> 00:14:58.333
Battle head on, with
all of your might

00:14:58.333 --> 00:15:00.400
and you will both
emerge victorious,

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.700
no matter what
the outcome.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.233
Battle!

00:15:04.233 --> 00:15:06.700
Good luck,
young warriors!

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.600
You two shall battle on the
training ground of destiny....

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.333
Sword Cemetery!

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.266
(computer)
Augmented reality
combat system energized.

00:15:16.266 --> 00:15:18.133
<i>Generation action field.</i>

00:15:18.133 --> 00:15:20.000
This looks familiar...

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.533
(Gong)
That's right.

00:15:21.533 --> 00:15:24.333
It's the same field as when
Gong battled against Kit Blade

00:15:24.333 --> 00:15:26.200
from the Leo Institute.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.300
Wait a minute...

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.333
Why'd you choose
this field?

00:15:29.333 --> 00:15:31.900
Gong has his
reasons, pal.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.600
Let's do this!

00:15:42.366 --> 00:15:45.266
Gong wants this win
just as much as you do!

00:15:45.266 --> 00:15:48.066
Well, that's too bad because
you're gonna lose!

00:15:48.066 --> 00:15:50.100
You ain't gonna
beat Gong, no way!

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.166
We'll see.

00:15:51.166 --> 00:15:53.133
We'll all see Gong
come out on top!

00:15:53.133 --> 00:15:54.166
(Both)
Let's...

00:15:55.533 --> 00:15:56.500
Duel!

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.600
(computer)
Action Cards
dispersed.

00:16:03.566 --> 00:16:05.133
You're in
for it now.

00:16:05.133 --> 00:16:08.366
Gong summons the sweet sounding
Superheavy Samurai Flutist!

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.133
And now Gong's going
to tribute it

00:16:15.133 --> 00:16:17.900
to summon an even more
powerful Superheavy Samurai.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.033
Gong summons Superheavy Samurai
Big Benkei in defense mode!

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.833
Gong thinks that's
enough for right now.

00:16:30.833 --> 00:16:33.433
He brought out a Level
8 monster already?

00:16:33.433 --> 00:16:35.966
Guess King Gong's not
monkeying around this time.

00:16:35.966 --> 00:16:37.733
Yuya better be
on his toes.

00:16:37.733 --> 00:16:39.900
If there weren't so much
on the line with this match,

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.366
it'd be easier to decide
who to root for.

00:16:42.366 --> 00:16:45.066
I want Gong to win since
he's had our back through thick

00:16:45.066 --> 00:16:48.100
and thin, but I want Yuya
to win for our School!

00:16:50.166 --> 00:16:51.266
What do I do?

00:16:53.633 --> 00:16:54.833
Quiet!

00:16:54.833 --> 00:16:56.300
You're louder
than Yuya's snoring!

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.033
Do you want Yuya to know
we're hiding out in here?

00:16:59.033 --> 00:17:00.466
That's right!

00:17:00.466 --> 00:17:02.300
Nico told us we
could only stay here

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.900
if we didn't let Yuya know
we were watching him!

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.266
(Skip)
Sorry.

00:17:06.266 --> 00:17:07.900
Can Yuya stand
on his own two feet

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.833
and beat big, bad
ol' Gongy?

00:17:09.833 --> 00:17:11.533
I can't wait to see!

00:17:16.633 --> 00:17:18.866
(Yuya)
My most important
battle ever,

00:17:18.866 --> 00:17:21.133
and it's gotta
be against Gong!

00:17:21.133 --> 00:17:23.500
I wouldn't've made it
this far without him.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.666
If Gong hadn't
taken me into his dojo

00:17:25.666 --> 00:17:27.866
and let me battle his
own students,

00:17:27.866 --> 00:17:29.566
I wouldn't've
had all the experience

00:17:29.566 --> 00:17:33.700
and knowledge about dueling
that got me here.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.066
Now to get into
the championship,

00:17:36.066 --> 00:17:39.200
I gotta stop the guy who
helped me get here.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.866
(Gong)
You're flattering yourself,
Yuya, and you're insultin' Gong.

00:17:42.866 --> 00:17:43.800
Quit yer moping!

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:48.066
Gong don't need
your pity.

00:17:48.066 --> 00:17:49.633
Gong already
told you...

00:17:49.633 --> 00:17:52.200
Gong's coming at you
with everything Gong's got!

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.133
If you're smart you'll
do the same thing,

00:17:54.133 --> 00:17:55.400
but you'll lose anyway!

00:17:58.866 --> 00:18:03.433
Guess again!

00:18:03.433 --> 00:18:06.900
I summon Performapal
Silver Claw!

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:19.600
Let's ride,
Silver Claw!

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.633
Yes!

00:18:20.633 --> 00:18:22.433
This is bad news
for you,

00:18:22.433 --> 00:18:25.766
cause I'm activating the
Action Spell Extreme Sword,

00:18:25.766 --> 00:18:27.466
which gives Silver
Claw's attack points

00:18:27.466 --> 00:18:28.800
a thousand‐point
power up!

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.300
Another lucky break!

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.366
I activate the Action
Spell Over Sword!

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:41.033
It gives my Performapal Silver
Claw 500 more attack points!

00:18:41.033 --> 00:18:43.766
Yuya's smart to grab all
the action cards he can.

00:18:43.766 --> 00:18:44.833
Looks like he's
going for the gold!

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.033
Yuya's dueling to win just
like he always does!

00:18:49.033 --> 00:18:51.566
My goosepickles
got goosepickles!

00:18:51.566 --> 00:18:54.433
It's great that Yuya's
trying so hard to win,

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:57.733
but Silver Claw's only
got 3,300 attack points.

00:18:57.733 --> 00:19:00.800
That's not enough to beat Big
Benkei's 3,500 defense points.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.633
It's go time.

00:19:04.633 --> 00:19:07.233
Silver Claw, attack
his Big Benkei!

00:19:08.633 --> 00:19:11.333
Now, Silver Claw's
special ability activates:

00:19:11.333 --> 00:19:13.533
it gains 300 attack points
when it attacks!

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.833
That's more points
than Big Benkei!

00:19:18.833 --> 00:19:20.566
Yuya can
take it out!

00:19:20.566 --> 00:19:21.900
My pickels
are goosy!

00:19:25.266 --> 00:19:26.533
Sorry, to
bust your bubble,

00:19:26.533 --> 00:19:29.433
but Gong's sendin' Superheavy
Samurai Soulfire Suit

00:19:29.433 --> 00:19:33.133
to the graveyard, to
activate its special ability!

00:19:34.766 --> 00:19:37.633
This armor protects Big Benkei
from your attack!

00:19:37.633 --> 00:19:39.933
Tough luck,
Silver Claw!

00:19:39.933 --> 00:19:42.700
Then Big Benkei loses
800 defense points,

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.033
but that's a
small price to pay.

00:19:47.266 --> 00:19:48.900
Oh great.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.533
I couldn't destroy
his monster,

00:19:50.533 --> 00:19:53.533
and Silver Claw's attack
points now drop back to normal.

00:19:53.533 --> 00:19:56.566
Just my luck!

00:19:56.566 --> 00:19:57.966
Winning this duel's
gonna be even harder

00:19:57.966 --> 00:19:59.166
than I thought
it'd be.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:05.766
I place one card facedown...
and end my turn.

00:20:06.866 --> 00:20:07.966
Just as
we expected.

00:20:07.966 --> 00:20:09.966
Yuya attacking
aggressively,

00:20:09.966 --> 00:20:13.666
while your boy Gong
stands his ground confidently.

00:20:13.666 --> 00:20:14.933
Yes.

00:20:14.933 --> 00:20:17.300
No matter how much
the opponent rushes about,

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.433
my son remains immovable
and is not distracted.

00:20:20.433 --> 00:20:23.066
He is upholding my Duel
Dojo's noble tradition

00:20:23.066 --> 00:20:25.466
of the """Heavystrong"
style of dueling.

00:20:25.466 --> 00:20:26.866
Nicely done, Gong!

00:20:26.866 --> 00:20:29.633
Continue to prove
yourself my worthy successor!

00:20:29.633 --> 00:20:32.133
Earn your way into the Junior
Arc League Championship

00:20:32.133 --> 00:20:34.833
using our unbeatable,
Heavystrong style!

00:20:34.833 --> 00:20:36.600
You don't have to you
worry about that, Dad.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.066
Trust in Gong!

00:20:38.066 --> 00:20:40.200
We still got a long
way to go though...

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:44.900
But Yuya ain't seen the half
of what I got in store for him.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.733
Bring it on.

00:20:47.733 --> 00:20:48.866
Okay!

00:20:48.866 --> 00:20:49.800
Gong's
bringing it!

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.000
Here we go.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.833
Gong's opponent's
a good friend.

00:20:56.833 --> 00:20:58.466
He knows
Gong's moves.

00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:02.666
That's why Gong's gonna
throw a real curveball!

00:21:02.666 --> 00:21:04.533
Watch this, Daddy!

00:21:04.533 --> 00:21:08.633
Your boy's putting a whole new
twist on our Heavystrong style!

00:21:08.633 --> 00:21:12.333
I summon the Tuner Monster
Superheavy Samurai Trumpeter!

00:21:19.333 --> 00:21:21.166
He played
a Tuner Monster?

00:21:21.166 --> 00:21:22.466
I can't believe it!

00:21:22.466 --> 00:21:24.000
He's Synchro Summoning!

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.500
(gasping)

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.766
Gong tunes Level 2
Superheavy Samurai Trumpeter

00:21:28.766 --> 00:21:31.533
with Level 8 Superheavy
Samurai Big Benkei!

00:21:40.566 --> 00:21:42.866
There's no way you're
ready for what's next!

00:21:42.866 --> 00:21:44.966
This monster is gonna bring
you some big‐league pain!

00:21:47.933 --> 00:21:49.933
I Synchro
Summon my Level 10

00:21:49.933 --> 00:21:53.166
Superheavy Samurai
Warlord Susanowo!

00:22:00.766 --> 00:22:02.266
I can't
believe it.

00:22:02.266 --> 00:22:03.966
Gong Synchro
Summoned.

00:22:03.966 --> 00:22:07.633
Gracious me!
Can it be?!

00:22:07.633 --> 00:22:08.700
He actually
did it.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.066
Well,
that's a shock.

00:22:10.066 --> 00:22:12.066
It sure is,
and my guts telling me

00:22:12.066 --> 00:22:15.533
this duel's gonna
be electric!

00:22:15.533 --> 00:22:17.700
(Yoko)
Oh, Yuya...

00:22:20.166 --> 00:22:21.900
This is it,
my friend.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.000
This is when the real
battle begins between us...

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.533
and your dream ends.

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:09.433
