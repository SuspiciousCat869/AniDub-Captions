WEBVTT

00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.966
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:06.700
(Sylvio)
Yuya Sakaki's going to pay!

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.166
He's the one
who did this to me!

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:11.466
He tried to hide behind
that mask, but I know!

00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.233
(Skip Boyle)
You're Henrietta Akaba.

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:16.566
Yes. Chairwoman of
the Leo Institute of Dueling.

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:20.100
Why don't we all
have a little talk?

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.900
Yuya made a fool
of our student!

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.133
(gasping)

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.233
This is now about honor,

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:28.333
honor that we have all lost

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.366
but that we will
soon restore

00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:33.933
by way of our students
battling in a duel.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.566
If your school wins,

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:38.000
then I'll forget about
the Yuya incident.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.766
But if we win the duel,

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:44.933
the Leo Institute will take over
the You Show Duel School.

00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.466
We will have
three separate matches

00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.333
between three duelists
from my school

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.733
and three from yours.

00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.766
The one facing Yuya
will be Dipper.

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.800
It's showtime!

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.833

Bring it on, Dipper.
I'm ready for your very best!

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.933
Hmm.

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:03.400
Yuya's quite sure of himself.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.833
Now we'll get to see
if he has the right to be.

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:08.600
Proceed, Dipper!

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.366
Give Yuya
a celestial smackdown!

00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:13.900
With great pleasure,
Madame Chairwoman!

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.700
Let's get this started!

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.733
First, I summon
Constellar Algiedi!

00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:22.666
What makes this star‐studded
monster so special?

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:24.866
When she's on the field,
I'm allowed to summon

00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:27.833
another Constellar monster
from my hand.

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:32.500
So, come on out,
Level 4 Constellar Kaus.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.200
And he's got a stellar
special ability, too.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.933
Twice per turn,
I can raise the level

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:41.866
of one Constellar monster
on the field by one.

00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:44.733
So, for Kaus' first
bolstering bow blast,

00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:48.200
I'm aiming to level up
Constellar Algiedi!

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.266
And for his second shot,

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:54.666
I think I'll have Kaus rain down
a level raise on himself.

00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:58.866
You know what
that lets me do?

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:01.533
I overlay these two
level‐five Constellars

00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:05.566
in order to build
the Overlay Network.

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:10.300
I Xyz Summon rank five
Constellar Pleiades!

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:24.400
Whoa, no way!

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.166
He Xyz'd?

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:28.700
What's a rank?
Did he mean level?

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.133
(Sora)
No, but allow me to take your
thinking to the next level.

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:35.400
Okay, so this here
is how it works.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.600
When you overlay multiple
monsters with the same level,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.300
you can summon an Xyz monster
from your extra deck.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.966
That's an Xyz Summon.

00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:44.700
And instead of having
a level,

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.266
an Xyz monster has
what's called a rank.

00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:50.200
(Allie)
Okay, but what are those lights
around it?

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.800
(Sora)
Those are overlay units.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.200
Xyz Monsters use them

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.033
to activate
their special abilities.

00:03:56.033 --> 00:03:57.266
Ah!
Ah!

00:03:57.266 --> 00:04:00.166
That'll do for now.
I'll end my turn.

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:04.033
(Henrietta)
Guess now we'll find out
if Yuya is really the duelist

00:04:04.033 --> 00:04:08.433
everyone's making him out to be
or if he's just a dud.

00:04:08.433 --> 00:04:10.800
Okay, I draw!

00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:15.700
I'll use Stargazer Magician
and Timegazer Magician

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.566
to set the Pendulum Scale.

00:04:17.566 --> 00:04:20.566
I'm taking control of this duel
starting now!

00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:28.700
Aw, yeah!

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.433
This is how you give an audience
a show!

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.566
I'm allowed to summon monsters
from level 2 through level 7

00:04:37.566 --> 00:04:38.866
all at the same time!

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.166
Swing far, pendulum!

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:46.833
Carve the arc of victory!

00:04:46.833 --> 00:04:51.600
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.733
It's your turn
to take the stage.

00:04:53.733 --> 00:04:56.400
Performapal Sword Fish

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.100
and Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.066
Yay!

00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:04.000
This is better
than a blutwurst strudel!

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.966
Pendulum summoning,
what a sight.

00:05:06.966 --> 00:05:09.233
So, this is
the new duel technique

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:11.433
I've been hearing about.

00:05:11.433 --> 00:05:14.533
That's right, and it's gonna be
the star of this show

00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:17.133
and what saves our school
from you.

00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:19.500
(Zuzu)
I sure hope you're right, Yuya,
'cause if you're not,

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.433
it'll be class dismissed
for good!

00:05:23.992 --> 00:05:25.258
(Dipper)
Okay, then, Yuya,

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:28.758
if this is the star attraction,
let's see it shine.

00:05:28.758 --> 00:05:30.592
We are all waiting.

00:05:30.592 --> 00:05:35.158
I activate my Sword Fish's
special ability.

00:05:35.158 --> 00:05:36.758
I'll get right to the point.

00:05:36.758 --> 00:05:38.625
Once per turn,
it can slice and dice

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:41.492
your monster's attack points
by 600.

00:05:44.092 --> 00:05:45.358
Gong likes!

00:05:45.358 --> 00:05:48.325
Now Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon
has more attack points.

00:05:48.325 --> 00:05:49.725
That's right.

00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:50.925
And because it does,

00:05:50.925 --> 00:05:55.225
I now attack Pleiades
with Odd‐Eyes.

00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:58.325
(Dipper)
Seriously? Like I didn't see
this coming.

00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:01.292
I activate
Pleiades's ability!

00:06:01.292 --> 00:06:05.125
Now, by using an Overlay Unit,
one card on the field

00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:07.492
immediately returns
to the hand it came from.

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:10.492
And the card I choose
is Odd‐Eyes!

00:06:10.492 --> 00:06:11.958
(screaming)

00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.658
This might hurt.

00:06:13.658 --> 00:06:15.358
(groaning)

00:06:15.358 --> 00:06:16.558
Yuya!

00:06:16.558 --> 00:06:19.525
(groans)
That smarts.

00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:23.492
Looks like the star attraction
got a bad case of stage fright.

00:06:23.492 --> 00:06:25.758
We'll see.

00:06:25.758 --> 00:06:27.958
Now what, Yuya?

00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:31.925
Now I'm in trouble
because without my Odd‐Eyes,

00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:34.792
I don't have a monster
that can take out Pleiades.

00:06:36.358 --> 00:06:37.358
(grunts)

00:06:37.358 --> 00:06:38.958
Unless...

00:06:41.825 --> 00:06:45.092
Going somewhere, Yuya?

00:06:45.092 --> 00:06:47.892
(Yuya)
If I can get to where that star
hit that temple,

00:06:47.892 --> 00:06:50.825
there should be an Action Card
waiting!

00:06:54.025 --> 00:06:56.992
(grunts)
(Dipper laughing)

00:06:56.992 --> 00:06:58.658
Let me guess, Yuya.

00:06:58.658 --> 00:07:00.692
You're looking
for this, right?

00:07:00.692 --> 00:07:03.425
No way! How doyou
have it already?

00:07:03.425 --> 00:07:06.592
Like I said before,
space is my style of play.

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:08.525
I know everything
about this field

00:07:08.525 --> 00:07:09.858
and its Action Cards,

00:07:09.858 --> 00:07:12.792
so you really don't
stand a chance.

00:07:12.792 --> 00:07:14.292
(groans)

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:24.792
(Dipper)
See? It's pointless.

00:07:24.792 --> 00:07:26.758
(laughing)

00:07:26.758 --> 00:07:29.492
Might be.

00:07:29.492 --> 00:07:30.992
Gong sure is mad.

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:33.692
How can Yuya win like this?
I don't know.

00:07:33.692 --> 00:07:36.592
It's like we've played right
into the Chairwoman's hands.

00:07:36.592 --> 00:07:38.325
(chuckling)

00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:40.825
Yuya, it's my fault!

00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:43.458
I chose the field!
Forgive me!

00:07:43.458 --> 00:07:45.058
I'm sorry!

00:07:45.058 --> 00:07:47.758
(Dipper)
He can stuff his sorrys
in a sack.

00:07:47.758 --> 00:07:50.558
The bottom line is
I've never lost on this field

00:07:50.558 --> 00:07:52.858
and I don't plan on
starting now.

00:07:52.858 --> 00:07:57.558
Especially to a second‐rate
duel school flunky like you.

00:07:57.558 --> 00:07:59.958
Yeah? We'll just see
about that.

00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.325
I end my turn
with a facedown!

00:08:02.325 --> 00:08:03.658
(Dipper)
Then, you know what that means.

00:08:03.658 --> 00:08:05.392
Your Fishy's ability ends,

00:08:05.392 --> 00:08:08.425
and Pleiades's attack points
return to normal.

00:08:08.425 --> 00:08:11.525
So much for Yuya being
the next big thing.

00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:14.325
(Dipper)
Ha! Your Pendulum Summoning
technique

00:08:14.325 --> 00:08:17.425
is nothing compared
to my Xyz Summoning!

00:08:17.425 --> 00:08:21.392
And the You Show School
is no match for team Leo.

00:08:21.392 --> 00:08:22.658
(scoffs)

00:08:22.658 --> 00:08:25.392
Now, then, it's my go!

00:08:25.392 --> 00:08:30.858
First, Constellar Pleiades
attacks Performapal Sword Fish!

00:08:30.858 --> 00:08:32.758
(screaming)

00:08:32.758 --> 00:08:33.758
Yuya!

00:08:33.758 --> 00:08:34.758
(groans)

00:08:34.758 --> 00:08:36.725
(all gasping)

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:38.892
You're getting
what you deserve, Yuya,

00:08:38.892 --> 00:08:41.125
for what you did
to my classmate Sylvio,

00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:42.958
for putting him
in the hospital.

00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.425
For the last time, Dipper...

00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:46.425
that wasn't me!

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:47.825
So typical.

00:08:47.825 --> 00:08:50.258
First you lie about
the power of the pendulum,

00:08:50.258 --> 00:08:53.525
and now you're lying about
what you did to Sylvio.

00:08:53.525 --> 00:08:55.925
The power of Pendulum
summoning is true!

00:08:55.925 --> 00:08:57.358
Not from what I've seen.

00:08:57.358 --> 00:08:59.858
I'll play one card
on the field facedown,

00:08:59.858 --> 00:09:02.258
and that's my turn.

00:09:02.258 --> 00:09:03.525
(Yuya)
This isn't good.

00:09:03.525 --> 00:09:06.092
So long as Pleiades
has an Overlay Unit to use,

00:09:06.092 --> 00:09:07.925
it won't matter
what monster I play.

00:09:07.925 --> 00:09:10.092
It'll just be returned
to my hand.

00:09:10.092 --> 00:09:14.292
Although, he does have
just one Overlay Unit left.

00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:16.992
Okay, my draw!

00:09:16.992 --> 00:09:19.425
And now for an encore.
Go!

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:21.492
Pendulum Summon!

00:09:21.492 --> 00:09:23.525
Now make your way
to the stage

00:09:23.525 --> 00:09:25.992
Performapal Turn Toad

00:09:25.992 --> 00:09:30.458
and once again,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:09:30.458 --> 00:09:32.425
Ohh...

00:09:32.425 --> 00:09:35.458
Come on, Yuya,
a rerun monster already?

00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:37.158
How's that entertainment?

00:09:37.158 --> 00:09:39.892
You're just gonna
have to wait and see.

00:09:39.892 --> 00:09:41.625
Oh.

00:09:41.625 --> 00:09:44.292
And you're not gonna have to
wait very long,

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:45.892
'cause here goes.

00:09:45.892 --> 00:09:47.625
Huh?

00:09:47.625 --> 00:09:49.125
Yes!

00:09:49.125 --> 00:09:51.792
Get set, Odd‐Eyes!

00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:54.025
(roaring)

00:09:54.025 --> 00:09:57.258
Seems he's going
for the Action Card once more.

00:09:57.258 --> 00:10:01.158
I guess he didn't learn
his lesson the first time.

00:10:04.992 --> 00:10:06.792
Why's he taking such a risk?

00:10:06.792 --> 00:10:07.992
Gong doesn't know.

00:10:07.992 --> 00:10:10.725
Gong's never seen him duel
with such abandon.

00:10:10.725 --> 00:10:13.458
Sometimes it's like
he's a different person.

00:10:13.458 --> 00:10:15.825
(Zuzu)
Different person.

00:10:22.292 --> 00:10:25.025
Could it be?

00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:26.892
Must get to that card.

00:10:30.458 --> 00:10:33.192
I activate Pleiades's
special ability!

00:10:33.192 --> 00:10:38.125
Now, by using one Overlay Unit,
Odd‐Eyes returns to your hand.

00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:39.292
(screaming)

00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.925
Uh‐oh, shut your eyes!
This could be bad!

00:10:45.925 --> 00:10:48.392
(grunting)

00:10:48.392 --> 00:10:50.292
(screaming)

00:10:52.609 --> 00:10:53.909
(grunting)

00:10:53.909 --> 00:10:54.842
Yuya!

00:10:54.842 --> 00:10:56.191
Do something!

00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:58.591
Sure.
Let's try this!

00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:01.557
I play the Trap
Performapal Revival!

00:11:01.557 --> 00:11:05.324
Since a special ability made
my Odd‐Eyes leave the field,

00:11:05.324 --> 00:11:08.524
I can summon one Performapal
back from my graveyard.

00:11:08.524 --> 00:11:11.291
Get set to slice
and dice, Sword Fish.

00:11:11.291 --> 00:11:13.657
(whimpering)

00:11:15.224 --> 00:11:17.757
(Dipper)
Way to hang in there.

00:11:17.757 --> 00:11:19.324
That is not funny!

00:11:19.324 --> 00:11:21.591
So, how does Yuya
get out of this?

00:11:21.591 --> 00:11:23.791
Like a pendulum.
He swings.

00:11:23.791 --> 00:11:25.591
(grunting)

00:11:25.591 --> 00:11:28.224
You baited me
with that Pendulum Dragon,

00:11:28.224 --> 00:11:30.357
but it won't matter.

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:33.724
I play Cosmic Arrow!

00:11:33.724 --> 00:11:36.291
And it's aiming
to take out that Action Spell

00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:38.791
you just picked up.

00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:42.591
So, what are you
going to do now?

00:11:42.591 --> 00:11:45.757
I end my turn.
I'm out of moves.

00:11:45.757 --> 00:11:48.824
But Pleiades is also
out of Overlay Units,

00:11:48.824 --> 00:11:51.957
which means
my Performapals are safe.

00:11:51.957 --> 00:11:56.124
My turn! I draw!

00:11:56.124 --> 00:11:58.191
I summon Constellar Sombre.

00:11:58.191 --> 00:12:01.157
So, say hello.

00:12:01.157 --> 00:12:02.491
And now say good‐bye

00:12:02.491 --> 00:12:04.857
to any chance you had
of winning this duel.

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:06.824
Because with Sombre's
ability,

00:12:06.824 --> 00:12:09.657
by banishing a Constellar
monster from my graveyard,

00:12:09.657 --> 00:12:12.791
I can add to my hand a different
Constellar from my graveyard,

00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:16.191
and I choose Constellar Kaus.

00:12:16.191 --> 00:12:18.524
But I'm not done yet, Yuya,

00:12:18.524 --> 00:12:21.724
because on the turn that
this ability is activated,

00:12:21.724 --> 00:12:24.991
guess what,
I'm allowed to summon it too.

00:12:27.024 --> 00:12:30.224
Two monsters
with the same level?

00:12:30.224 --> 00:12:31.491
Then, that means...

00:12:31.491 --> 00:12:32.924
Hold on.

00:12:32.924 --> 00:12:35.524
I still have Kaus's
ability to play. Ha!

00:12:35.524 --> 00:12:38.057
As you may remember,
with it,

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:41.524
I can increase a monster's level
by one twice per turn.

00:12:41.524 --> 00:12:43.691
And the two monsters
I'll be targeting

00:12:43.691 --> 00:12:47.724
with this enhancing effect
are Sombre and Kaus.

00:12:50.957 --> 00:12:53.924
Level 5? Not good.

00:12:53.924 --> 00:12:55.391
Not for you it isn't,

00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:59.824
because now I overlay
Constellar Sombre and Kaus!

00:12:59.824 --> 00:13:03.324
I build the Overlay Network
and Xyz Summon

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:07.357
another Rank 5
Constellar Pleiades!

00:13:09.391 --> 00:13:11.257
So, now there's
two of them?

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:12.624
(chuckles)

00:13:12.624 --> 00:13:14.357
That's right,
but don't you worry.

00:13:14.357 --> 00:13:17.024
This power‐packed pair
won't be together for long.

00:13:17.024 --> 00:13:19.357
One of them has got far better
things to do,

00:13:19.357 --> 00:13:21.224
or perhaps I should say

00:13:21.224 --> 00:13:24.924
a far better monster that
it's about to create right now.

00:13:24.924 --> 00:13:28.357
I was afraid that it was
going this way.

00:13:28.357 --> 00:13:30.324
The stars are in alignment.

00:13:30.324 --> 00:13:33.157
By overlaying
Constellar Pleiades,

00:13:33.157 --> 00:13:34.457
I can Xyz Summon

00:13:34.457 --> 00:13:37.757
another even stronger
Constellar monster!

00:13:37.757 --> 00:13:39.491
Even stronger? How?

00:13:39.491 --> 00:13:42.591
Observe for yourself,
Yuya.

00:13:44.257 --> 00:13:47.091
Observe the great,
the mighty,

00:13:47.091 --> 00:13:51.691
Rank 6
Constellar Ptolemy M7!

00:13:51.691 --> 00:13:53.824
(Henrietta)
Perhaps now you all understand

00:13:53.824 --> 00:13:57.257
why it's best the Leo Institute
take over your teachings.

00:13:57.257 --> 00:14:00.391
That is, if we even go so far
as to re‐admit any of you.

00:14:00.391 --> 00:14:01.724
(chuckling)

00:14:04.757 --> 00:14:06.257
(gasps)

00:14:06.257 --> 00:14:07.857
Turn Toad, spring to it!

00:14:09.191 --> 00:14:10.391
Come on, hurry!

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:12.157
Not so fast.

00:14:12.157 --> 00:14:15.624
I activate Constellar Pleiades's
ability.

00:14:15.624 --> 00:14:17.824
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:14:17.824 --> 00:14:21.457
Performapal Turn Toad
leaps back into your hand.

00:14:21.457 --> 00:14:25.757
(whimpering, groaning)

00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:29.857
And now,

00:14:29.857 --> 00:14:32.924
Pleiades, attack Sword Fish!

00:14:34.324 --> 00:14:35.691
(screaming)

00:14:37.324 --> 00:14:38.457
(both gasp)

00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:44.724
(Yuya)
An Action Card!

00:14:44.724 --> 00:14:47.257
Yuya, look out!

00:14:47.257 --> 00:14:49.257
(Yusho)
Never forget, son,

00:14:49.257 --> 00:14:51.557
when the show must go on,

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:54.491
you must go all out.
(echoing)

00:14:54.491 --> 00:14:55.757
You got it, Dad!

00:15:00.324 --> 00:15:01.657
(chuckles)

00:15:07.357 --> 00:15:08.657
All right!

00:15:08.657 --> 00:15:10.024
He nabbed it!

00:15:10.024 --> 00:15:12.857
No way.
This can't be.

00:15:12.857 --> 00:15:16.424
Yes, it can, and now this show's
gonna keep on goin' on!

00:15:16.424 --> 00:15:17.924
(Sora)
Way to go, Yuya!

00:15:17.924 --> 00:15:19.257
(Skip Boyle)
Awesome play!

00:15:19.257 --> 00:15:20.824
(Tate and Allie)
You're our hero!

00:15:20.824 --> 00:15:22.657
I love a hero sandwich!

00:15:22.657 --> 00:15:25.091
This duel's ending
right here and now.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:28.957
Constellar Ptolemy M7,
attack Yuya!

00:15:28.957 --> 00:15:32.457
I activate the Action Spell
Twinkle Comet!

00:15:32.457 --> 00:15:34.457
Now until
the end of the turn,

00:15:34.457 --> 00:15:38.391
Ptolemy M7's attack points
decrease by 1,000,

00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:41.057
and you take 500 points
of damage.

00:15:43.891 --> 00:15:45.824
(screaming)

00:15:47.691 --> 00:15:49.524
You fool!

00:15:49.524 --> 00:15:52.457
All you've done
is prolong the inevitable.

00:15:52.457 --> 00:15:55.091
But if you want to experience
more duel suffering,

00:15:55.091 --> 00:15:56.257
works for me!

00:15:56.257 --> 00:16:00.124
I activate the spell card
Constellar Tempest!

00:16:00.124 --> 00:16:03.657
Only when I have two or more
Xyz Monsters on my field

00:16:03.657 --> 00:16:05.691
can this storm get brewing,

00:16:05.691 --> 00:16:09.324
or perhaps I should say
firestorm!
(screaming)

00:16:09.324 --> 00:16:12.824
And this fire'll take its toll
on your life points,

00:16:12.824 --> 00:16:15.257
torching them in half
when I end my turn.

00:16:15.257 --> 00:16:17.724
So, I'll end it right now.

00:16:17.724 --> 00:16:20.691
(screaming)

00:16:20.691 --> 00:16:21.891
And that also means

00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:25.157
Ptolemy M7's attack points
go back to normal.

00:16:25.157 --> 00:16:27.391
You're all mine next round.

00:16:27.391 --> 00:16:29.824
This duel is over.

00:16:36.686 --> 00:16:39.053
You're all mine next round.

00:16:39.053 --> 00:16:40.786
This duel is over.

00:16:40.786 --> 00:16:42.253
(Frederick)
Not yet it's not.

00:16:42.253 --> 00:16:43.753
(Allie)
Yeah, how do you know?

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:46.086
Because dueling's
a business,

00:16:46.086 --> 00:16:48.586
and when you treat it that way,
you're sure to win.

00:16:48.586 --> 00:16:50.320
(Yuya)
No!
Huh?

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.620
Dueling's about...
(groans)

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.753
...the passion
of your play.

00:16:55.753 --> 00:16:56.820
(gasps)

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.553
By seeing the passion
of their play.

00:17:03.653 --> 00:17:06.320
(Yuya)
It's like I said before.

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.020
Dueling's not a business
at all.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.886
It's a show business.

00:17:10.886 --> 00:17:13.753
And now it's showtime!

00:17:13.753 --> 00:17:15.320
First up...

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.820
I summon
Performapal Trampolynx!

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.486
And when this feline
takes to the field,

00:17:21.486 --> 00:17:26.286
I'm allowed to return one card
in play back to my hand.
(meow)

00:17:26.286 --> 00:17:31.286
And I choose
the Scale 1 Stargazer Magician.

00:17:31.286 --> 00:17:33.720
Wait.
But he was part of the Pendulum.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.053
Ya, so now what?

00:17:35.053 --> 00:17:37.853
Now, 'cause Stargazer left,
I get to replace him

00:17:37.853 --> 00:17:40.120
with another monster
of my choosing.

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:44.220
And I choose Turn Toad.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.320
(gasps)

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.320
Huh?!

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.153
And after you see
what's next,

00:17:48.153 --> 00:17:49.353
you're gonna flip,

00:17:49.353 --> 00:17:51.653
because now
with the Scale 3 Turn Toad

00:17:51.653 --> 00:17:53.586
and Scale 8 Timegazer,

00:17:53.586 --> 00:17:56.853
I have a brand‐new
pendulum scale to work with.

00:18:06.053 --> 00:18:07.686
And this
premiere performance

00:18:07.686 --> 00:18:10.253
is totally going to have you
on the edge of your seat.

00:18:10.253 --> 00:18:16.186
I can now summon any monsters
from levels 4 through 7.

00:18:16.186 --> 00:18:20.586
Ready or not,
here... they... come!

00:18:22.653 --> 00:18:27.353
First, I'll cast Stargazer
Magician in a starring role.

00:18:27.353 --> 00:18:29.353
So, instead of being part
of the pendulum,

00:18:29.353 --> 00:18:31.286
he's now purely a monster.

00:18:31.286 --> 00:18:33.386
And now
for the super‐starring role,

00:18:33.386 --> 00:18:36.186
give it up one more time
for...

00:18:36.186 --> 00:18:39.320
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.186
(roaring)

00:18:43.186 --> 00:18:45.120
It again? No worries.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.620
Because I activate
Constellar Pleiades's ability!

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.153
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:18:51.153 --> 00:18:53.020
Odd‐Eyes returns
to your hand.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.920
Yeah, but it won't be gone
for too long.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.986
Huh?

00:18:56.986 --> 00:18:59.986
And it's all thanks
to Stargazer's ability!

00:18:59.986 --> 00:19:01.520
With it, once per turn,

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.986
if a Pendulum Monster
on my field leaves,

00:19:03.986 --> 00:19:06.820
I'm allowed to summon it
right back.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.053
And this time
it's here to stay.

00:19:09.053 --> 00:19:12.520
(roaring)

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.453
But I'm not done
just yet.

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:17.386
Next, I activate
another ability.

00:19:17.386 --> 00:19:20.186
Turn Toad's Pendulum
ability, to be exact.

00:19:20.186 --> 00:19:23.353
I can flip a monster's
attack and defense points.

00:19:23.353 --> 00:19:25.586
And the monster
whose points I'll be swapping

00:19:25.586 --> 00:19:27.820
is Stargazer Magician.

00:19:31.053 --> 00:19:31.986
Ah?

00:19:31.986 --> 00:19:34.186
Next I activate
the spell card

00:19:34.186 --> 00:19:37.653
Magical Star Illusion.

00:19:37.653 --> 00:19:40.386
Since Stargazer Magician
is out and about,

00:19:40.386 --> 00:19:42.686
I add up the levels
of all of my monsters,

00:19:42.686 --> 00:19:44.020
and they gain attack points

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.986
equal to a hundred times
the total.

00:19:45.986 --> 00:19:47.286
And it's not just me.

00:19:47.286 --> 00:19:48.920
You get to do
the exact same thing

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.420
with your monsters,
Dipper.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.953
Whoa, do the math.

00:19:51.953 --> 00:19:54.020
This has the potential
to be really big!

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.153
Odd‐Eyes is Level 7,
and Stargazer is 5.

00:19:57.153 --> 00:20:00.386
Trampolynx is Level 2,
so that's 14.

00:20:00.386 --> 00:20:02.520
Multiply that amount
by 100,

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.786
and Yuya's monsters
gain 1,400 attack points!

00:20:05.786 --> 00:20:10.686
Ya, but won't all of Dipper's
monsters rise in power, too?

00:20:10.686 --> 00:20:12.720
No, they won't.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.253
Oh, yeah!
Xyz monsters only have ranks!

00:20:16.253 --> 00:20:18.453
So, Dipper's monsters
won't change at all!

00:20:18.453 --> 00:20:20.153
This can't be happening!

00:20:20.153 --> 00:20:24.420
Looks like you taking me down
just wasn't in the stars.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:29.753
Now, Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon,
attack Constellar Ptolemy M7!

00:20:29.753 --> 00:20:33.486
Go Spiral Flame Strike!

00:20:33.486 --> 00:20:36.020
(screaming)

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:39.720
(Yuya)
Now, Stargazer Magician,
attack Pleiades!

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.120
Astronomy Attack!

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.153
(whimpering)

00:20:46.153 --> 00:20:48.086
And now for the big finisher.

00:20:48.086 --> 00:20:51.286
Trampolynx,
attack Dipper directly!

00:20:51.286 --> 00:20:54.653
(Dipper)
Wait. No. I'm allergic.

00:20:56.953 --> 00:20:58.353
(screaming)

00:21:00.286 --> 00:21:01.520
(Yuya)
That's a wrap!

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.586
Hope you all
enjoyed the show.

00:21:06.586 --> 00:21:08.553
Oh, yeah!

00:21:08.553 --> 00:21:10.653
Here come the waterworks!

00:21:10.653 --> 00:21:11.853
Ohh...

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.186
(laughing)

00:21:16.186 --> 00:21:18.020
Thank you! Thank you!

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:18.953
(laughing)

00:21:21.453 --> 00:21:23.720
(Zuzu)
I wish I could enjoy this
with the others,

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.986
but Yuya said
to trust my heart,

00:21:25.986 --> 00:21:28.720
and my heart's more confused
than ever.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.420
