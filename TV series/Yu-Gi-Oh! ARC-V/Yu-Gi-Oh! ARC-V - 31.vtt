Duel fans,
prepare yourselves!

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.500
Our next Arc League
Championship battle

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.233

It's Yuya Sakaki

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.100
in a duel destined
to dazzle!

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.133
Go Yuya!

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.166
Good luck!

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.533

Aw, I've heard Pendulum
Summoning isn't even real!

With the whole world watching,
guess we'll all find out.

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:36.266
And find out if Yuya's the next
big thing or a big phony.

He's dressed up

Do you know why I
dress as a warrior?

Yuya Sakaki, you've

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:34.466
When was this?

00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:35.966
First time:

00:02:35.966 --> 00:02:39.666
You stole my Pendulum cards and
then used them to beat me!

00:02:39.666 --> 00:02:40.800
Remember?

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.133
Uh, no.

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:44.100
Those cards I
"stole" were mine.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.533
Time two:

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:48.200
You wore a mask and injured
me in a second duel!

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.466
Admit it.

00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:50.766
Afraid not.

00:02:50.766 --> 00:02:53.366
I wasn't the one
underneath that mask.

00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:54.766
Third time!

00:02:54.766 --> 00:02:57.600
You dishonored my family
by assaulting my dad!

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.133
I know that
it was you!

00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:01.700
Nope...
Still not me.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.833
Oh, you can deny
all you want.

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:06.866
Bottom line is you
and I have history, Yuya!

00:03:06.866 --> 00:03:08.700
Now it's payback
time.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.700
For all of the defeats
and disrespect,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.833
now I will finally
settle the score.

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:15.400
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.833
Top‐notch trash talk and we
haven't even started yet!

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:22.066
Finally, Yuya's gonna
be put in his place.

00:03:22.066 --> 00:03:24.033
And if you think
Pendulum cards

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:27.200
are going to save
you, think again,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.100
'cause they're actually
gonna be your downfall.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.333
I'm gonna lose because
of Pendulum cards?

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:37.733
(Yuya)
Wait a sec...

00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:39.533
I hear the Leo Corporation
is starting

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:43.033
to independently
develop Pendulum Cards now.

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:46.533
I'll be the first in line
when they release.

00:03:46.533 --> 00:03:50.166
And then you and I are
going to settle things.

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:54.066
(Yuya)
Can it be that Sylvio has
Pendulum cards of his own now?

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:56.533
Now, let's set
the stage, shall we?

00:03:56.533 --> 00:03:59.233
Let's select the duel's
Action Field!

00:03:59.233 --> 00:04:01.033
<i>Here it comes!</i>

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:02.833
<i>And...</i>

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:03.766
<i>there it is!</i>

00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:07.533
Now lights, camera...

00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:09.233
<i>Action Field!</i>

00:04:09.233 --> 00:04:11.500
And it looks like
this match's Action Field

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.266
will be Sunset
Stronghold!

00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:17.400
(computer)
Augmented reality
combat system energized.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.933
<i>Generating Action Field.</i>

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:27.166
Okay!

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:29.700
Let's turn this field
into a battlefield!

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.733
Don't have to
ask me twice‐‐ Go!

00:04:31.733 --> 00:04:34.366
(both)
Now, time to see who
the best duelist is!

00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:37.200
I'm so excited I could
scream so I think I will!

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.000
(high‐pitched screaming)

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.233
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:04:42.666 --> 00:04:44.966
(computer)
<i>Action Cards dispersed.</i>

00:04:44.966 --> 00:04:46.500
Go ahead Yuya,
you first.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.666
Fine then!

00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:51.800
Since neither of us
has any monsters out,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.766
I can lower this
monster's level by one

00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:56.800
to summon it right out
onto the field!

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.100
So go bananas
Performapal Drummerilla!

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.866
Then I'll play
a facedown...

00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:05.166
And that's it.

00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:06.766
Yes, that will
be it!

00:05:06.766 --> 00:05:09.766
Because now
begins... Your downfall!

00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:11.433
It's my turn!

00:05:11.433 --> 00:05:12.800
I draw!

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.500
First I activate the spell card
Yosen Training Grounds!

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.666
For centuries, ghostly samurai
spirits known as Yosenjus

00:05:19.666 --> 00:05:21.700
wandered these
sacred grounds.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.200
So whenever I
summon a Yosenju,

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.866
one of my candles
will light up!

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:26.633
You mean
those candles?

00:05:26.633 --> 00:05:28.333
Yep and
speaking of...

00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:30.733
Let's light one
up right now!

00:05:30.733 --> 00:05:34.433
I summon
Yosenju Kama 1!

00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:36.633
And due to his
special ability...

00:05:36.633 --> 00:05:39.033
I can now summon
another Yosenju Kama

00:05:39.033 --> 00:05:42.600
so long as it's different spirit
than the one I just summoned.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.900
So come on out
Yosenju Kama 2!

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.733
But why stop at two, when I
can bring out a third one?

00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:52.100
Take to the field
Yosenju Kama 3!

00:05:54.766 --> 00:05:57.300
What a sensational
start for Sylvio!

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.000
Summoning three
monsters in one move!

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.333
Surely, you didn't think
your Pendulum technique

00:06:03.333 --> 00:06:05.800
was the only way one
could summon monsters quickly,

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.433
did you, Yuya?

00:06:08.433 --> 00:06:11.466
Oh and don't forget, since I
summoned three samurai spirits,

00:06:11.466 --> 00:06:13.966
due to Yosen Training
Grounds' effect,

00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:16.933
three of those
candles light up!

00:06:16.933 --> 00:06:18.000
Guys...

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.500
What do
those do?

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.566
My best guess?
Bad stuff.

00:06:21.566 --> 00:06:23.100
Way to start
strong!

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.066
Just like a
samurai warrior!

00:06:25.066 --> 00:06:27.366
Now don't let up!

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:29.533
Next I play
Kama 1's ability!

00:06:29.533 --> 00:06:32.166
Since there's another of his
Kama brothers already out...

00:06:32.166 --> 00:06:35.066
I'm now allowed to return one
monster that's on your field

00:06:35.066 --> 00:06:36.566
back to your hand!

00:06:36.566 --> 00:06:40.166
What?

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:41.633
So long,
Drummerilla!

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.433
This isn't good!

00:06:48.433 --> 00:06:50.433
His field's now
completely bare!

00:06:50.433 --> 00:06:52.700
Yuya's wide open
to attack!

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.433
And now...
Let's go!

00:06:54.433 --> 00:06:56.133
Kama 1 attack!

00:07:01.966 --> 00:07:03.333
(Sylvio)
Kama 1 attack!

00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:06.366
Yuya!

00:07:06.366 --> 00:07:07.800
I play a
trap card!

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.000
Go Performapal
Pinch Helper!

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.900
And it's helping me
out of this pinch

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.600
by negating your
monster's direct attack!

00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:17.933
That's not all.

00:07:17.933 --> 00:07:20.200
Then I can summon a
Performapal from my deck

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.333
that's gonna make sure that
me and my life points

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:25.166
are safe and sound
from all of your monsters!

00:07:25.166 --> 00:07:27.266
I summon Kaleidoscorp
in defense mode!

00:07:28.733 --> 00:07:30.800
And it'll defend
me all right!

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.866
Because with 2,300
points of defensive power,

00:07:33.866 --> 00:07:36.166
your monsters can't
get past it!

00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:37.333
Ha!

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:40.133
Sure they can, with Kama 2's
special ability...

00:07:40.133 --> 00:07:41.700
He loses half
his attack points

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.366
but can then attack
you directly!

00:07:45.366 --> 00:07:47.466
Sylvio found a way
around Kaleidoscorp,

00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:52.133
so Yuya better
act fast!

00:07:52.133 --> 00:07:54.266
Dashing off for
an Action Card?

00:07:54.266 --> 00:07:55.966
I don't think so!

00:07:55.966 --> 00:07:57.466
Blow him
off his feet!

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.800
(screams)

00:08:04.366 --> 00:08:06.066
(Sylvio)
And I'm not
done yet.

00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:08.733
Now Kama 3's
ability activates!

00:08:08.733 --> 00:08:11.133
Since my samurai spirit
dealt you damage,

00:08:11.133 --> 00:08:14.366
Kama 3's special ability
lets me draw another Yosenju

00:08:14.366 --> 00:08:16.533
from my deck
to my hand!

00:08:16.533 --> 00:08:18.366
And the one I choose is...

00:08:18.366 --> 00:08:20.233
My Yosenju Oyam!

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.400
Then I activate Yosen
Training Grounds' effect!

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.833
By blowing out
three candles,

00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:30.166
I can add another samurai
spirit from my deck to my hand!

00:08:32.466 --> 00:08:34.600
I bet you'd like to
know what it is,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.600
well what you don't
know won't hurt you...

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.333
at least not yet.

00:08:38.333 --> 00:08:40.300
And now I'll end
my turn,

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.633
by simply placing
a single card facedown.

00:08:43.633 --> 00:08:46.533
And when my turn ends,
my three samurai warriors

00:08:46.533 --> 00:08:48.133
return to my hand.

00:08:48.133 --> 00:08:49.933
Say bye...

00:08:49.933 --> 00:08:51.700
For now!

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.933
(Yuya)
So Sylvio's
field is empty?

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:56.100
That means he's wide
open for attack!

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.933
Is this some
kind of trap?

00:08:58.933 --> 00:09:00.033
Hey!

00:09:00.033 --> 00:09:02.400
We're all waiting on you
to do something, Yuya!

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.400
What's the hold up?

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.700
(Nico Smiley)
Uh‐oh!
Is it paralysis by analysis

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.100
or is Yuya frozen
with fear?

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.233
(Yuya)
Trap or not.

00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:12.033
I can't afford to
play it safe.

00:09:12.033 --> 00:09:14.100
I gotta duel
like a star!

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.366
My turn!

00:09:15.366 --> 00:09:17.466
I draw!

00:09:17.466 --> 00:09:18.966
Aw, yeah!

00:09:18.966 --> 00:09:21.900
I'll use Stargazer Magician
and Timegazer magician

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.400
to set
the Pendulum Scale!

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.000
I'm taking control of this
duel starting now!

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.233
♪

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.133
I can summon monsters
from Level 2 through 7

00:09:42.133 --> 00:09:44.100
all at the same time!

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.000
All right!
All right!

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.466
Hooray pretzels!

00:09:46.466 --> 00:09:47.733
I mean,
yeah Yuya.

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.566
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:09:53.566 --> 00:09:55.133
Carve the arc
of victory!

00:09:57.866 --> 00:10:01.166
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:10:03.866 --> 00:10:05.966
Get your beat on
Performapal Drummerilla!

00:10:08.866 --> 00:10:14.100
Turn up the heat Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.200
(Nico Smiley)
<i>There it is!</i>

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.833
Yuya's patented
Pendulum Summoning

00:10:17.833 --> 00:10:20.266
that we've all been speaking
so much about!

00:10:20.266 --> 00:10:22.166
I've never seen
anything like it!

00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:23.966
So it really is real!

00:10:23.966 --> 00:10:25.966
And now it's
showtime!

00:10:25.966 --> 00:10:28.733
And it'll be a short show
at that 'cause if Odd‐Eyes

00:10:28.733 --> 00:10:31.466
and Drummerilla hit with their
attacks, Sylvio's through!

00:10:31.466 --> 00:10:35.133
That's true, Tate,
but that's a big "if."

00:10:35.133 --> 00:10:37.066
(chuckling)

00:10:37.066 --> 00:10:38.933
Now go Odd‐Eyes!

00:10:38.933 --> 00:10:42.033
Take to the stage then take it
to Sylvio with all you've got!

00:10:44.933 --> 00:10:47.966
I activate Yosenju Oyam's
special ability!

00:10:47.966 --> 00:10:50.566
Now, since you've
attacked me directly...

00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:53.266
By discarding one of
my samurai spirits,

00:10:53.266 --> 00:10:56.166
I can summon Yosenju Oyam
in attack mode!

00:10:57.466 --> 00:10:58.833
What are its
attack points?

00:10:58.833 --> 00:11:01.366
Depends... you see Oyam's
attack points become the same

00:11:01.366 --> 00:11:02.800
as the monster
it's battling!

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.100
And once again,
one candle lights up

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.766
because I summoned a
Yosenju monster!

00:11:12.366 --> 00:11:15.966
Point is, my Oyam and
your Odd‐Eyes are history!

00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:17.100
You wish!

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.666
I activate Drummerilla's
special ability!

00:11:19.666 --> 00:11:22.933
I can increase the attack
points of my Odd‐Eyes by 600!

00:11:22.933 --> 00:11:24.700
So your tree's about
to get torched!

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.666
(growling)

00:11:28.666 --> 00:11:30.600
Now!
Go, Odd‐Eyes!

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.200
Spiral Flame
Strike!

00:11:34.233 --> 00:11:37.733
Oh, and when Odd‐Eyes destroys a
monster that's Level 5‐or‐above,

00:11:37.733 --> 00:11:40.133
battle damage is doubled!

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:41.933
(screaming)

00:11:41.933 --> 00:11:43.100
(Nico Smiley)
<i>Ouch!</i>

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.200
Sylvio has taken
1200 points of damage

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.966
and Oyam has
been bested!

00:11:47.966 --> 00:11:50.000
But now Oyam's
ability activates!

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.466
See Yuya, when Oyam's
destroyed in battle,

00:11:53.466 --> 00:11:57.333
I'm allowed to add
another Oyam to my hand!

00:11:57.333 --> 00:11:58.666
(Nico Smiley)
<i>Whoa!</i>

00:11:58.666 --> 00:12:00.133
Looks like Yuya's
not out of the woods yet

00:12:00.133 --> 00:12:03.133
when it comes to this menace
of a monster!

00:12:03.133 --> 00:12:04.800
(Yuya)
Even if I attack again,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.533
he'll just summon Oyam
to block my way.

00:12:08.533 --> 00:12:12.900
I end my turn, but my
cardio is just getting started!

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.300
Run all you want.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.633
You're not going to find any
cards that can save you.

00:12:16.633 --> 00:12:19.366
You may have Pendulum Summoned,
but like I said before,

00:12:19.366 --> 00:12:20.800
you're gonna find
out the true horrors

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.033
of Pendulum Summoning
soon enough!

00:12:24.033 --> 00:12:25.333
Horrors of
Pendulum Summoning?

00:12:25.333 --> 00:12:26.866
What does he mean?

00:12:26.866 --> 00:12:28.166
Boy...

00:12:28.166 --> 00:12:30.466
Sure sounds like he's got
something sneaky up his sleeve.

00:12:30.466 --> 00:12:31.600
Now Yuya...

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.433
It's my turn!

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:42.333
I'm summoning
Yosenju Kama 1!

00:12:42.333 --> 00:12:43.766
And since Kama 1
was summoned,

00:12:43.766 --> 00:12:46.933
I can now summon
Kama 2 and Kama 3!

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.133
Plus...

00:12:49.133 --> 00:12:52.100
I still have Yosen Training
Grounds' effect in play!

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.333
So, since these three
brothers were summoned,

00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:57.633
three more candles
light up!

00:12:57.633 --> 00:13:00.533
And Just like that, Sylvio
has again managed to mobilize

00:13:00.533 --> 00:13:02.700
three monsters on
his field!

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.966
No!

00:13:03.966 --> 00:13:06.200
Yuya's in the same position
he was in last turn!

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.433
This is terrible,
its wurst than a bratwurst

00:13:08.433 --> 00:13:10.766
without sauerkraut and
mustard on the side!

00:13:10.766 --> 00:13:12.166
And next...

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:14.400
I activate KAMA 2's
special ability,

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.366
by cutting his points in half,
he can attack you directly!

00:13:17.366 --> 00:13:19.266
I need an
Action Card!

00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:21.766
You gotta run like the wind
and hightail it outta there!

00:13:21.766 --> 00:13:24.100
Yeah Zuzu, should
be a breeze.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.066
(screaming)

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.166
Yuya!

00:13:35.166 --> 00:13:37.333
Kama 3's special
ability activates!

00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:39.600
Since my Yosenju
dealt you damage,

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.166
Kama 3's special ability lets
me draw another Yosenju!

00:13:45.166 --> 00:13:46.666
And the one
I'm adding...

00:13:46.666 --> 00:13:48.000
May surprise you...

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.833
It's a Pendulum
Monster!

00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:55.300
Yosenju Shinchu L!

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.166
So he does have
Pendulum cards!

00:13:57.166 --> 00:13:59.000
A Pendulum Monster?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.366
But how?

00:14:01.866 --> 00:14:04.500
I activate Yosen
Training Grounds' effect...

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.233
By extinguishing
three candles,

00:14:06.233 --> 00:14:08.700
I can add one samurai
spirit to my hand!

00:14:10.733 --> 00:14:12.433
And I know just
the one I want!

00:14:12.433 --> 00:14:15.300
Yosenju Shinchu R
is the perfect addition

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.566
to help me subtract
you from this duel!

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:20.000
Another
Pendulum Monster!

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.133
That's two!

00:14:21.133 --> 00:14:22.166
You look shocked.

00:14:22.166 --> 00:14:23.633
I don't
know why.

00:14:23.633 --> 00:14:27.433
I warned you that Pendulum
cards would be your downfall!

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:30.766
I'll use Scale 3
Yosenju Shinchu L

00:14:30.766 --> 00:14:34.666
and Scale 5 Yosenju Shinchu R
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.666
Looks like this duel's
about to swing my way!

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.433
We'll see.

00:14:48.433 --> 00:14:51.200
With that set up you'll only be
able to summon Level 4 monsters

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.266
and I can handle that!

00:14:53.266 --> 00:14:54.300
Level 4?

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.433
Ha!

00:14:55.433 --> 00:14:57.166
In your dreams,
Yuya!

00:14:57.166 --> 00:14:59.166
Yosenju Shinchu
R and L

00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:00.866
are so perfectly in
tune with each other,

00:15:00.866 --> 00:15:03.433
that the Pendulum Scale
tips in my favor

00:15:03.433 --> 00:15:05.233
and rises to 11.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.666
(gasping)

00:15:08.666 --> 00:15:10.766
Which means now I
can summon monsters

00:15:10.766 --> 00:15:13.833
from Levels 4
thru 10, Yuya!

00:15:13.833 --> 00:15:15.633
And I think I'll
do just that,

00:15:15.633 --> 00:15:18.900
behold, a beast born
from the howls of the winds!

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.966
A creature composed
of chaos and cruelty!

00:15:21.966 --> 00:15:24.733
I give you
Mayosenju Daibak!

00:15:24.733 --> 00:15:27.100
(growling)

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.033
(Nico Smiley)
<i>Oh, my!</i>

00:15:31.033 --> 00:15:33.266
That's one monster I
wouldn't want to mess with!

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:36.066
But it's looking like Yuya
won't have a choice!

00:15:36.066 --> 00:15:37.666
(growling)

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.700
(growling)

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.500
(Nico Smiley)
<i>Simply sensational!</i>

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.866
Sylvio has performed a
perfect Pendulum Summon!

00:15:48.866 --> 00:15:51.966
(man)
A strong surge of Pendulum
energy has just been detected.

00:15:51.966 --> 00:15:54.500
(man)
Power balance and output
levels are both stable.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.633
Mr. President,
the summoning was a success.

00:16:01.166 --> 00:16:03.100
Yay, Sylvio,
way to go!

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.900
I'm going as you
for Halloween!

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.900
(Sylvio)
Now, thanks to Daibak,
another candle lights up!

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.866
I still can't believe
someone other than Yuya

00:16:10.866 --> 00:16:12.866
was able to Pendulum Summon!

00:16:12.866 --> 00:16:15.500
And Sylvio may even be
better at it than Yuya!

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.933
I knew that this
day would come...

00:16:17.933 --> 00:16:21.433
But I had no idea that it
would come so very soon!

00:16:21.433 --> 00:16:24.433
I know Yuya can still come
back from this... I think...

00:16:24.433 --> 00:16:25.900
That's right!

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.700
Give it up
for Sylvio!

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.233
You all know
you love me!

00:16:29.233 --> 00:16:31.866
No way!
We still love Yuya!

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:34.000
Yuya is a has‐been!

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.433
I'm the new hot
duelist now!

00:16:36.433 --> 00:16:37.900
And you know why?

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.233
Because I've taken Yuya's
Pendulum Summoning method

00:16:40.233 --> 00:16:42.433
to a whole
new level!

00:16:42.433 --> 00:16:44.133
Have not!

00:16:44.133 --> 00:16:46.100
That's 'cause
I'm not done yet!

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.766
By activating Daibak's
special ability!

00:16:48.766 --> 00:16:51.100
I'm allowed to select
two cards on the field

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.566
and return them from
whence they came!

00:16:54.566 --> 00:16:58.366
So, Stargazer Magician
and Timegazer Magician,

00:16:58.366 --> 00:17:00.666
return to
Yuya's hand!

00:17:00.666 --> 00:17:02.266
There's more!

00:17:02.266 --> 00:17:04.100
Since Daibak's
out on my field...

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.400
I can play the trap card
Dizzying Winds Of Yosen Village!

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.533
Now, your Stargazer Magician
and Timegazer Magician

00:17:12.533 --> 00:17:15.633
are going to be swept from your
hand back to your your deck!

00:17:15.633 --> 00:17:19.233
(Nico Smiley)So not only has
Sylvio learned how to play with
Pendulum cards

00:17:19.233 --> 00:17:22.566
but he's figured out a way
toprevent Yuya from playing
his!

00:17:22.566 --> 00:17:24.266
There's
more Yuya!

00:17:24.266 --> 00:17:26.500
Next by paying
800 life points...

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.533
I can activate the spell
card Yosen Whirlwind

00:17:28.533 --> 00:17:30.800
and that's just
what I'll do!

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.333
And it's
blowing your way!

00:17:33.333 --> 00:17:35.600
Because now I
end my turn,

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.633
but don't think it's
the end of your suffering!

00:17:37.633 --> 00:17:39.133
Not in the least!

00:17:39.133 --> 00:17:41.566
That's only
getting started!

00:17:41.566 --> 00:17:43.300
I don't like where
you're going with this...

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.000
Nor should you, Yuya,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.366
because when one of my samurai
spirits returns to my hand,

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:49.833
the effect of my
spell Yosen Whirlwind

00:17:49.833 --> 00:17:52.800
returns one card on your
field to your hand!

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.466
And then Dizzying Winds
Of Yosen Village

00:17:55.466 --> 00:17:57.566
returns that card
to your deck,

00:17:57.566 --> 00:18:00.033
so your hand will be empty and
you won't have a single card

00:18:00.033 --> 00:18:02.133
left to play!

00:18:02.133 --> 00:18:05.166
Now, since I ended my turn,
the three Kama brothers

00:18:05.166 --> 00:18:07.700
are about to exit
the field once again!

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.200
Which means....

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.733
The Winds are
now roaring!

00:18:10.733 --> 00:18:13.066
First three cards
return to your hand...

00:18:13.066 --> 00:18:14.566
And after that...

00:18:14.566 --> 00:18:15.866
They return to
your deck!

00:18:15.866 --> 00:18:18.200
Where you'll have a hard
time drawing them again!

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.466
So say so long to Pinch Helper,
Kaleidoscorp and Drummerilla!

00:18:22.466 --> 00:18:25.566
Sylvio's gotten rid of
nearly all of Yuya's monsters!

00:18:25.566 --> 00:18:28.666
Only Odd‐Eyes
is left!

00:18:28.666 --> 00:18:32.266
Seems you're down to your
very last monster, Yuya!

00:18:32.266 --> 00:18:34.600
But thanks to Daibak's
special ability,

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.466
it's going back
to my hand,

00:18:36.466 --> 00:18:38.300
triggering
my card combo

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.466
so your Odd‐Eyes is
out of here, too!

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.300
Bye‐bye!
Won't miss you!

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.900
Oh, no!

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.300
If I had it in my hand,
I coulda summoned it again,

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.866
but if it's in my deck, I
don't have access to it.

00:18:58.033 --> 00:18:59.366
Oh, Yuya...

00:18:59.366 --> 00:19:02.400
Isn't it something, how
the spotlight you so crave

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.433
will soon only be
shining on me!

00:19:05.433 --> 00:19:08.400
You may have wanted
be a star, Yuya...

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.933
But take a
nice, long look!

00:19:10.933 --> 00:19:13.666
I'm dueling's
next big thing!

00:19:13.666 --> 00:19:16.866
Well, he's certainly got
the big ego to go with it.

00:19:16.866 --> 00:19:18.066
What's next?

00:19:18.066 --> 00:19:19.433
A bunch of
camera close‐ups?

00:19:19.433 --> 00:19:20.833
Oh, don't you
worry, Kit.

00:19:20.833 --> 00:19:22.400
I'm sure that
they're coming.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.400
Face it.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.433
You have
been outmatched.

00:19:25.433 --> 00:19:27.066
All you can do
now is lose!

00:19:33.966 --> 00:19:34.966
Face it!

00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:36.466
You have
been outmatched!

00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:39.966
All you can do
now is lose!

00:19:39.966 --> 00:19:41.700
Since I ended
my turn,

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:45.333
Yosenju Shinchu R's
Scale returns to normal.

00:19:45.333 --> 00:19:49.100
So this is how you seal away
the power of a Pendulum card.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.466
That is correct.

00:19:50.466 --> 00:19:51.900
It's taken
some time...

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.500
But finally...

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.533
I was able
to figure it out.

00:19:55.533 --> 00:19:58.533
Now let's see if Yuya is
capable of figuring out a way

00:19:58.533 --> 00:20:02.033
to escape this
predicament.

00:20:02.033 --> 00:20:05.033
Remember when I told you that we
had a score to settle, Yuya?

00:20:05.033 --> 00:20:06.266
Well, guess what?

00:20:06.266 --> 00:20:08.633
It's just
about settled!

00:20:08.633 --> 00:20:11.900
Because after you take this
next turn, I'm afraid...

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:12.900
You...

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.500
Are so
going down!

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.733
Oh, no!

00:20:15.733 --> 00:20:16.966
Just look at
Yuya's face!

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:20.400
He looks beaten,
like he's given up.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.200
My turn.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.833
C'mon, Yuya,
let's go!

00:20:23.833 --> 00:20:24.933
Get fired up!

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:26.366
You can do
this, Yuya!

00:20:26.366 --> 00:20:27.866
(all)
We believe in you!

00:20:27.866 --> 00:20:31.366
Hold on...

00:20:31.366 --> 00:20:32.533
Yuya...

00:20:32.533 --> 00:20:33.533
He's smiling!

00:20:33.533 --> 00:20:34.933
He's what?!

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:38.766
(Yuya)
To be a real star,
you've gotta have real drama...

00:20:38.766 --> 00:20:42.566
And right now, I can feel
it all around me!

00:20:42.566 --> 00:20:46.766
Right now,
it's time to shine!

00:20:46.766 --> 00:20:48.100
What are you
smiling for?

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.633
You're about
to lose!

00:20:49.633 --> 00:20:50.866
Maybe!

00:20:50.866 --> 00:20:52.500
Maybe not!

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.533
But either way,
it'll be a great show!

00:20:54.533 --> 00:20:56.266
A great show?

00:20:56.266 --> 00:20:57.533
Draw!

00:20:57.533 --> 00:20:59.800
I place two
cards facedown!

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.033
And end my turn.

00:21:02.033 --> 00:21:03.600
Huh?
That's it?

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.133
Are you for real?

00:21:05.133 --> 00:21:06.900
That's your idea
of a great show?

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.533
Ha.

00:21:10.533 --> 00:21:11.800
Guess without
your Pendulum cards,

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.333
you're not the duel‐tainer
that you thought you were!

00:21:15.333 --> 00:21:17.300
True, those cards
are gone...

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.900
But there are other
cards still out there!

00:21:22.433 --> 00:21:23.766
Yuya?

00:21:23.766 --> 00:21:25.566
It's okay!

00:21:25.566 --> 00:21:28.066
(Gong)
Yuya's got that showtime
look in his eyes!

00:21:28.066 --> 00:21:31.400
♪

00:21:32.566 --> 00:21:34.766
Time for my
biggest production yet!
