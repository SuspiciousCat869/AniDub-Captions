WEBVTT

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.500
All right!

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.866
This is perfect!

00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.533
It all
starts tomorrow.

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.666
My first step to
becoming a pro

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.566
and I'm gonna win
the four duels I need

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.900
to qualify for the Junior
Arc League Championship

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.166
with this deck.

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:22.266
I just realized there's a way to
evolve the Pendulum method!

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:26.866
I won't lose to anybody.

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.200
Not even to him.

(barking)

00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:44.633
Good morning, En.

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:45.666
(meowing)

00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:48.933
Morning Core, Watt, Kilo...

00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:51.100
Hey, where'd you two
come from?

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.900
Mom just can't
say no to strays.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.266
(Sora)
Yuya.

00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:58.900
Good morning.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.533
And speaking
of strays...

00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:03.066
You're certainly here
bright and early.

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.666
Well, you know
what they say.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.500
Breakfast is the most
important meal of the day!

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.133
And it's especially important
for you today, Yuya.

00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:13.366
You have your first
big duel this morning

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.700
and I have my first duels
today, just like you.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.233
Your guy
Nico Smiley came through

00:02:17.233 --> 00:02:19.000
and hooked me up
big time!

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.266
You mean you're dueling
today to try to get into

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.500
the Junior Arc League
Championship, too?

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.666
Yeah.

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:26.600
Since I only have to
win six matches in a row,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.966
it'll be a breeze!

00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:30.400
Yeah, a breeze.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.733
Hey, Mom.

00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:32.733
When's breakfast?

00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:34.533
(Yoko)
Not for a while.

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:37.300
I'm making
Sunrise Pork Loaf Surprise

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.166
and the recipe's a little
complicated.

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:42.633
To tell you the truth, Mom,
I'd really rather you just made

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:44.066
something like pancakes.

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:46.000
Well, everybody's
raving about Reed Pepper

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.066
and I want to try one
of his recipes.

00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:50.833
Mom it's a real important
day so please hurry up.

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:52.300
I'm cooking
as fast as I can!

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.066
I can't be late for
my first duel!

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:55.000
(clattering)

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.733
Now look what
you made me do.

00:02:56.733 --> 00:02:59.733
♪

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:01.533
(stomach rumbling)

00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:03.166
(groaning)

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:05.366
The one day I need
a good breakfast

00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:07.800
and I wind
up starving.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.266
Hey, that smells
great!

00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:11.866
It's breakfast time!

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.333
What's this?

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:25.300
"Chairman Fava's
Flavor Factory?"

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.133
This is the address,
where the duel's supposed to be.

00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:32.766
You've come to
the right place, Yuya.

00:03:32.766 --> 00:03:34.766
Step right in.

00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:36.733
It's‐‐ in here?

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:38.366
Hang on, you
sure about this?

00:03:38.366 --> 00:03:39.666
Here we go!

00:03:53.377 --> 00:03:55.143
(sizzling)

00:03:55.143 --> 00:03:56.877
(bubbling)

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.687
I'm so hungry.

00:04:02.687 --> 00:04:05.821
(Nico Smiley)
Allow me to introduce your
celebrity opponent for today,

00:04:05.821 --> 00:04:09.553
the king of the kitchen,
Reed Pepper!

00:04:09.553 --> 00:04:13.019
(cheering)

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.753
(Reed Pepper)
So you're
Yuya Sakaki.

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:19.186
Nice to meet you.

00:04:19.186 --> 00:04:22.276
Reed Pepper is a fabulously
famous celebrity chef

00:04:22.276 --> 00:04:24.209
who has a huge
following among those who wish

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:25.943
to introduce a dash of delish

00:04:25.943 --> 00:04:28.443
into their dreary,
flavor‐free lives.

00:04:28.443 --> 00:04:30.043
(stomach rumbling)

00:04:30.043 --> 00:04:33.109
Sounds like you might
be a little hungry, Yuya.

00:04:33.109 --> 00:04:35.709
Well, my breakfast did
get kind of messed up.

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:39.409
Plus, it's hard to resist all
the delicious smells in here!

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.443
Well, if you've got
a taste for competition,

00:04:41.443 --> 00:04:43.309
I'll just have to whip
up a cooking duel

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:46.976
based on some of my fans'
all‐time favorite recipes.

00:04:46.976 --> 00:04:49.709
(Matilda)
Chairman Fava!

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:51.743
Why are you treating
my son this way?

00:04:51.743 --> 00:04:54.043
My Reed has already
fulfilled all the requirements

00:04:54.043 --> 00:04:56.309
to enter the Junior Arc
League Championship!

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:58.576
Why does he have to
have another match?

00:04:58.576 --> 00:05:01.376
Ma'am, I've explained all
this to you before...

00:05:01.376 --> 00:05:03.409
(Reed)
Mom, it's fine.

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:05.143
I'm going to be up
against Yuya.

00:05:05.143 --> 00:05:06.376
He's known as the duelist

00:05:06.376 --> 00:05:09.309
who managed to beat
the Sledgehammer.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.109
But it's
no big deal.

00:05:11.109 --> 00:05:13.809
I'll have him for
breakfast.

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:15.243
Of course
you will, Reed.

00:05:15.243 --> 00:05:17.576
For you, this should
be a piece of cake.

00:05:17.576 --> 00:05:19.909
Show everybody you're
just as good as any duelist

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.443
that silly Leo Institute
ever turned out.

00:05:22.443 --> 00:05:25.009
Leave it to me.

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:27.976
Time to shake
and bake!

00:05:27.976 --> 00:05:31.043
(Tate)
Yuya!

00:05:31.043 --> 00:05:32.776
What are you
guys doing here?

00:05:32.776 --> 00:05:34.276
We're here to
cheer you on!

00:05:34.276 --> 00:05:36.409
This duel's your first
step to becoming a pro.

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.643
We wouldn't miss that
for anything.

00:05:38.643 --> 00:05:42.976
I get the goose pickles
just thinking about it!

00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:46.276
(Nico Smiley)
Ladies and gentlemen,
get ready for the Main Course!

00:05:46.276 --> 00:05:51.143
Now it's time to feast your
eyes on the challengers!

00:05:51.143 --> 00:05:54.509
The Sultan of Pendulum
Summoning, Yuya Sakaki,

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.409
versus the Hotshot of
Cooking Duels,

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:00.376
<i>Kitchen King Reed Pepper!</i>

00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:06.009
You can cook in
my kitchen anytime!

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:08.043
Sansho, are you
watching this?

00:06:08.043 --> 00:06:09.643
<i>You'd better be!</i>

00:06:09.643 --> 00:06:11.876
If I find out you were
prepping instead of
watching,

00:06:11.876 --> 00:06:13.809
<i>you're toast!</i>

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:17.643
And now, may I
present Chairman Fava!

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:20.743
(cheering)

00:06:20.743 --> 00:06:25.109
Cooking is a quest, a journey
to discover the ultimate.

00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:26.909
It is
the same with dueling.

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:29.109
These two opponents
are on a quest.

00:06:29.109 --> 00:06:31.876
For this reason it is fitting
that they battle on a field

00:06:31.876 --> 00:06:34.843
designed for a
phenomenal food fight!

00:06:34.843 --> 00:06:39.643
I activate the Action Field
Spell Chaos Kitchen!

00:06:39.643 --> 00:06:42.576
(computer)
Augmented reality
combat system energized.

00:06:42.576 --> 00:06:44.709
<i>Generating Action Field.</i>

00:06:48.443 --> 00:06:50.843
This is... freaky.

00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:52.243
(Reed)
It's perfect.

00:06:52.243 --> 00:06:54.876
Because this is where you're
going to get served.

00:06:54.876 --> 00:06:56.876
I couldn't care
less where we battle,

00:06:56.876 --> 00:07:01.909
'cause you winning
isn't on the menu!

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:04.809
So now I'm going to whip you
like a bowl o' heavy cream!

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:07.709
It's a battle of
delicious delights

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:10.609
and mouthwatering
monsters!

00:07:10.609 --> 00:07:14.543
Then let's get our cards out
and see who takes the cake!

00:07:14.543 --> 00:07:17.609
(all)
Action...

00:07:17.609 --> 00:07:19.476
Duel!
Duel!

00:07:19.476 --> 00:07:23.176
Freshness always rules
in the kitchen and in duels!

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:24.776
And that is why

00:07:24.776 --> 00:07:28.443
I only go with the very freshest
ingredients available.

00:07:28.443 --> 00:07:30.809
And the first
thing I'm serving up

00:07:30.809 --> 00:07:34.476
is one of my very tastiest,
hand‐picked recipe cards:

00:07:34.476 --> 00:07:37.643
Cookpal Cluckwheat!

00:07:37.643 --> 00:07:41.409
Let's get
cooking!

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:42.943
(clucking)

00:07:58.209 --> 00:08:00.109
I'll just grab
this Action Card!

00:08:01.476 --> 00:08:05.009
An Action Card
already?

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:07.776
Whoa...
This one's hot.

00:08:07.776 --> 00:08:10.609
Maybe too hot for
you to handle, Yuya.

00:08:10.609 --> 00:08:14.309
I activate the Action Spell
Monster Microwave!

00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:17.809
With Monster Microwave, I get to
send one monster on my field

00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:21.376
to my hand so I can summon
one Level 4‐or‐below monster

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:22.843
from my hand!

00:08:22.843 --> 00:08:24.809
So, I'm sending
Cluckwheat packing

00:08:24.809 --> 00:08:30.809
so I can summon
Cookpal Eggong!

00:08:30.809 --> 00:08:33.943
Now, Cluckwheat's special
ability activates

00:08:33.943 --> 00:08:36.876
letting me
hatch it again!

00:08:39.643 --> 00:08:43.309
And whenever I have at least
two Cookpals on my field,

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:47.543
I can whip up a pretty
wicked Cookpal Pumapotato!

00:08:47.543 --> 00:08:49.543
(growling)

00:08:49.543 --> 00:08:51.143
Tasty!

00:08:56.676 --> 00:08:58.643
(whirling)

00:09:00.209 --> 00:09:02.909
Oh, no!

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:05.809
Now I'll mix in
another Action Card.

00:09:05.809 --> 00:09:08.343
Whoa, Reed's already got
three monsters out.

00:09:08.343 --> 00:09:10.876
And don't forget
his Action Card!

00:09:10.876 --> 00:09:13.176
I hate to say this,
but I have a feeling

00:09:13.176 --> 00:09:16.609
Yuya's goose is about
to get cooked.

00:09:16.609 --> 00:09:20.676
I place my two cards
facedown and end my turn.

00:09:20.676 --> 00:09:24.509
Your young chef is certainly
off to a finger‐licking start.

00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:28.043
That's because he's following
his proven recipe for success.

00:09:28.043 --> 00:09:30.643
First, he prepares his
menu for the battle.

00:09:30.643 --> 00:09:32.076
That's right.

00:09:32.076 --> 00:09:34.409
And, believe me, this
is just the appetizer.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.320
(beeping)

00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:51.211
Now, it's my turn.

00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:53.878
You mean your
turn to lose!

00:09:58.011 --> 00:09:59.678
One down,
five to go.

00:09:59.678 --> 00:10:01.878
Who's next?

00:10:01.878 --> 00:10:06.344
Uh, it's over?

00:10:06.344 --> 00:10:08.244
Now hear this!

00:10:08.244 --> 00:10:10.911
(stomach grumbling)

00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:12.544
(groaning)

00:10:12.544 --> 00:10:15.511
(chuckling)

00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:16.611
Hey!

00:10:16.611 --> 00:10:18.844
Put some fire
in your belly!

00:10:18.844 --> 00:10:21.278
(Reed)
Sounds like your belly
wants breakfast.

00:10:21.278 --> 00:10:24.378
Too bad you have to
lose on an empty stomach.

00:10:24.378 --> 00:10:27.311
What makes you so sure
I'm gonna be the loser?

00:10:27.311 --> 00:10:30.344
I guess I'd have to say
it's just a gut feeling.

00:10:30.344 --> 00:10:33.244
But you shouldn't feel too
badly about it, Yuya.

00:10:33.244 --> 00:10:35.744
I'm the king
in this kitchen.

00:10:35.744 --> 00:10:38.378
Let's see what happens when
I turn up the heat!

00:10:38.378 --> 00:10:40.778
I summon Performapal
Whip Snake!

00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:49.011
Let's swing
into action!

00:10:56.844 --> 00:10:58.111
(gasping)

00:10:58.111 --> 00:10:59.278
That's not good.

00:11:02.244 --> 00:11:04.244
(groaning)

00:11:06.678 --> 00:11:07.978
Hey...

00:11:07.978 --> 00:11:10.611
That Action Card could turn
this duel upside down!

00:11:10.611 --> 00:11:13.844
Say, that kid's
sure hanging in there.

00:11:13.844 --> 00:11:16.278
That's because Yuya
happens to be the son

00:11:16.278 --> 00:11:19.811
of the revered Action Duel
pioneer Yusho Sakaki.

00:11:19.811 --> 00:11:23.311
Now I understand why you
think he has so much potential.

00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:25.444
Okay!

00:11:25.444 --> 00:11:28.444
Whip Snake
attack Eggong!

00:11:33.244 --> 00:11:36.878
I activate the Action Spell
Freeze Freezer!

00:11:36.878 --> 00:11:39.444
It puts all your monsters'
attacks on ice this turn.

00:11:44.944 --> 00:11:46.878
Das ist chilly!

00:11:46.878 --> 00:11:48.478
I'll fix that!

00:11:48.478 --> 00:11:52.011
I activate
Battle Burner!

00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:55.044
It defrosts one of my monsters
so that it can attack again.

00:12:00.644 --> 00:12:03.911
Okay, Whip Snake,
attack!

00:12:08.644 --> 00:12:09.878
Hooray!

00:12:09.878 --> 00:12:12.611
And Battle Burner
does even more damage.

00:12:12.611 --> 00:12:14.944
It destroys all your
other monsters!

00:12:24.178 --> 00:12:26.278
That chef doesn't
even have leftovers!

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:28.478
Ich habe zee goose
pickles again!

00:12:28.478 --> 00:12:30.011
Tough luck, Reed!

00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:34.278
You can't cook without
ingredients, can you?

00:12:34.278 --> 00:12:36.344
(laughing)

00:12:36.344 --> 00:12:38.111
You're right,
Yuya.

00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:39.344
But don't worry...

00:12:39.344 --> 00:12:42.478
You just
did me a favor!

00:12:42.478 --> 00:12:45.778
I activate the trap
Food Cemetery!

00:12:45.778 --> 00:12:49.378
So now all my destroyed monsters
are placed in Food Cemetery

00:12:49.378 --> 00:12:50.744
instead of
the graveyard!

00:12:50.744 --> 00:12:53.311
♪

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:02.178
I guess that's better than
going to a garbage disposal.

00:13:02.178 --> 00:13:05.478
Since I put three cards into
that culinary contraption,

00:13:05.478 --> 00:13:08.811
I get to draw three
new Cookpals from my deck.

00:13:08.811 --> 00:13:11.511
So thanks for destroying
my monsters, Yuya.

00:13:11.511 --> 00:13:13.211
You saved me
a lot of work.

00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:16.478
I could use an assistant
like you in my kitchen.

00:13:16.478 --> 00:13:20.011
Now I've got three
new dishes on my menu!

00:13:20.011 --> 00:13:22.844
Even his words
are tasty!

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:24.911
(Yuya)
I have a feeling
whatever this guy's cooking

00:13:24.911 --> 00:13:28.311
is gonna be hard
to swallow...

00:13:28.311 --> 00:13:30.778
You still
hungry, Yuya?

00:13:30.778 --> 00:13:35.844
Well, believe me, you
won't be for long.

00:13:35.844 --> 00:13:37.444
I draw!

00:13:39.211 --> 00:13:42.444
It's my honor to present to you
a move so deliciously divine

00:13:42.444 --> 00:13:44.244
your life points
won't know what hit them!

00:13:44.244 --> 00:13:45.511
Amazing!

00:13:45.511 --> 00:13:48.111
He's as good a duelist
as he is a chef!

00:13:48.111 --> 00:13:51.978
Get ready cause I'm serving
up the spell Regal Recipes!

00:13:51.978 --> 00:13:54.778
Since I have three cards
in my Food Cemetery,

00:13:54.778 --> 00:13:58.611
I can summon three Royal
Cookpals in attack mode!

00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:06.578
(Yuya)
I don't think I'm gonna
like the taste of this...

00:14:20.687 --> 00:14:21.920
(Reed)
Dinner is served!

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.787
Knight Pasta,

00:14:27.787 --> 00:14:29.453
Princess Pudding

00:14:29.453 --> 00:14:30.953
and Prince Curry!

00:14:39.787 --> 00:14:41.020
Hey, you guys...

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.820
Can you believe that Yuya
went to all that trouble

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.487
to get rid of
three monsters,

00:14:44.487 --> 00:14:46.620
but Reed already
summoned three back!

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:47.653
They look...

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:49.553
...totally yummy!

00:14:49.553 --> 00:14:52.787
I mean "crummy."
Totally crummy!

00:14:52.787 --> 00:14:56.020
My Royal Cookpals are
the finest, premium quality,

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.920
Grade A ingredients a cooking
connoisseur could have.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.687
And here's the best part:
Regal Recipes lets me keep

00:15:02.687 --> 00:15:05.553
my Food Cemetery fully stocked
with fresh ingredients

00:15:05.553 --> 00:15:07.420
to cook up more
delicious monsters.

00:15:09.687 --> 00:15:10.920
What do I do now?

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.453
If I destroy his
monsters,

00:15:12.453 --> 00:15:15.787
Reed's gonna summon more
monsters right away anyway!

00:15:15.787 --> 00:15:17.353
Exactly!

00:15:17.353 --> 00:15:20.253
It's a foolproof
recipe for victory!

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.787
Another Action Card!

00:15:23.787 --> 00:15:24.820
Another?

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.487
Man, this keeps
getting worse!

00:15:27.487 --> 00:15:29.353
While everything's
still hot,

00:15:29.353 --> 00:15:32.920
I'll stir in Regal Recipes'
other tasty effect!

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.920
You're gonna take
300 points of damage

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.887
for every one of its
Royal Cookpals!

00:15:40.653 --> 00:15:44.020
He summoned three Royal
Cookpals which means...

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.653
...which means
300 times three!

00:15:46.653 --> 00:15:48.787
900 points!

00:15:48.787 --> 00:15:50.087
Luckily for you,

00:15:50.087 --> 00:15:52.587
we gladly accept all
major life points, Yuya!

00:16:00.353 --> 00:16:02.420
I'll admit they
can dish it out,

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.187
but your monsters only have
300 attack points each.

00:16:05.187 --> 00:16:07.987
They need more than that
to take down my Whip Snake!

00:16:07.987 --> 00:16:09.753
That's true for now.

00:16:09.753 --> 00:16:11.053
But I have a
simple technique

00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:13.453
for making my Royal Cookpals
much stronger

00:16:13.453 --> 00:16:16.520
so they yield a double
batch of attack points.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.687
The proof is in
the Princess Pudding!

00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:21.220
This monster's
special ability

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.520
doubles my Prince Curry's
attack points.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.987
I love how that
boy makes his menu!

00:16:29.987 --> 00:16:31.520
So do I!

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.453
Especially when it
includes a tasty dessert!

00:16:34.453 --> 00:16:36.753
Princess Pudding
can't attack on the turn

00:16:36.753 --> 00:16:38.953
this special ability
is activated.

00:16:38.953 --> 00:16:43.487
Now I'm gonna toss in my
Knight Pasta's special ability!

00:16:43.487 --> 00:16:44.953
Just like
Princess Pudding,

00:16:44.953 --> 00:16:47.887
Knight Pasta doubles my Royal
Cookpals' attack points again!

00:16:50.787 --> 00:16:53.220
Double Curry,
pasta and pudding!

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.020
Now this is the kind
of kids' meal

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.087
I could really
sink my tooths into!

00:16:57.087 --> 00:16:59.820
Unfortunately, Knight Pasta
can't attack on the turn

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.053
that it uses
its special ability.

00:17:02.053 --> 00:17:03.820
(whimpering)

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.253
Hey, cut it out!

00:17:05.253 --> 00:17:09.553
I came here to watch a duel, not
to watch the two of you drool!

00:17:09.553 --> 00:17:12.020
Can't you see Yuya
needs this win so bad,

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.320
he can almost
taste it?

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.820
(stomach grumbling)

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:20.187
Is your head
empty, too?

00:17:20.187 --> 00:17:22.053
It certainly sounds
like my monster menu

00:17:22.053 --> 00:17:23.553
has whetted your
appetite.

00:17:23.553 --> 00:17:26.420
Well, I gotta
admit they look tasty.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.953
But it's attack points
that matter here...

00:17:28.953 --> 00:17:31.053
And your Prince Curry
still doesn't have enough

00:17:31.053 --> 00:17:33.187
attack points to whip
my Whip Snake!

00:17:33.187 --> 00:17:36.487
True...
But that could change.

00:17:36.487 --> 00:17:37.753
What if...

00:17:37.753 --> 00:17:40.153
I spice up
the Prince's potency?

00:17:40.153 --> 00:17:43.487
I activate the Action Spell
Spicy Spice!

00:17:43.487 --> 00:17:44.920
This lets me sprinkle
one monster

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.187
with an extra
thousand attack points.

00:17:49.253 --> 00:17:51.620
Now, Prince Curry:
pour it on!

00:17:56.487 --> 00:17:57.987
Let's cook!

00:17:57.987 --> 00:18:01.953
Prince Curry, attack Whip Snake
with Curry Catastrophe!

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.587
(groaning)

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.820
(groaning)

00:18:13.087 --> 00:18:14.287
What's the matter?

00:18:14.287 --> 00:18:17.020
My Curry too spicy
for you, Yuya?

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.420
I'm going to end my
turn now, Yuya,

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.220
so Prince Curry's
attack points return to normal

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.920
and all the power up effects
come to an end also!

00:18:29.087 --> 00:18:31.720
Have you had enough or are
you hungry for more, Yuya?

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.353
My turn!

00:18:39.053 --> 00:18:42.187
And this is going to be
hard for you to swallow!

00:18:42.187 --> 00:18:44.820
So far, you've been top
chef around here,

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.553
but now I'm the cook
who's gonna spoil your broth.

00:18:48.553 --> 00:18:52.020
I'll use Stargazer Magician
and Timegazer Magician

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.920
to set
the Pendulum Scale!

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.987
I'm taking control of this
duel starting now!

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.187
All right!
All right!

00:19:02.187 --> 00:19:04.453
Yuya's really
cooking!

00:19:04.453 --> 00:19:06.020
(Yuya)
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:09.720
Carve the arc
of victory!

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.853
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:19:16.787 --> 00:19:20.787
Jump to it Performapal
Trampolynx!

00:19:20.787 --> 00:19:24.687
Get set to lend a
helping hand, Partnaga!

00:19:24.687 --> 00:19:27.020
Turn up the heat Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:34.920
Party of
three, welcome!

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.620
I'm honored that
you've graced me

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.920
with your famous
Pendulum Summon,

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.020
even without
reservations.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.520
You're not scared?

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.020
Of course not.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.287
But you
should be.

00:19:46.287 --> 00:19:49.587
Because, whenever you summon a
monster on to your field,

00:19:49.587 --> 00:19:52.687
Princess Pudding, Knight Pasta
and Prince Curry's

00:19:52.687 --> 00:19:56.287
additional special
abilities activate!

00:19:56.287 --> 00:19:58.587
Ballistic Belly
Buster!

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.953
Hey, how come
only they get to eat?

00:20:10.953 --> 00:20:12.953
I'm the one who's
starving here!

00:20:15.987 --> 00:20:16.987
More!

00:20:16.987 --> 00:20:18.953
Eat more!

00:20:18.953 --> 00:20:22.520
Let my delectable monsters
stuff you full!

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.753
This is bad!

00:20:23.753 --> 00:20:26.453
He's force feeding...
the monsters.

00:20:26.453 --> 00:20:28.053
What a way to go!

00:20:33.487 --> 00:20:36.387
I hope your monsters
enjoyed their meal, Yuya,

00:20:36.387 --> 00:20:39.187
because it was
their last.

00:20:39.187 --> 00:20:42.620
By returning Princess Pudding,
Knight Pasta And Prince Curry

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.487
to my hand,

00:20:44.487 --> 00:20:47.853
I destroy one of your
monsters... for each card!

00:20:50.887 --> 00:20:52.753
No way...

00:20:52.753 --> 00:20:54.620
All my monsters
are gone!

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.587
I hope losing doesn't leave
a bad taste in your mouth!

00:21:03.587 --> 00:21:05.953
(laughing)

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.120
