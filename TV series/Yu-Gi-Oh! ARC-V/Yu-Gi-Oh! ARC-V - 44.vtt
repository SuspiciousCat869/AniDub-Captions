00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.500
(announcer on PA)
Folks, the attacks have been
flying fast and furious

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.333
in our competition,
and many hopefuls

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:10.166
have seen their dueling dreams
come crashing to the ground!

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:13.300
As our Arc League Championship
continues,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.733
let's hear from some of the fans
in the peanut gallery‐‐ Joy?

00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.166
Hi!

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:21.000
This is your roving reporter,
Joy Jeever, reporting live

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.133
from a cheering section
supporting the You Show School!

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.333
Skip Boyle,

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.766
as the school principal and
chief dueltaining coach,

00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.833
you must be thrilled
with how well Yuya Sakaki

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:32.566
and your daughter, Zuzu,
have performed so far.

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.300
What do you think has been the
key to their competitive
success?

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.366
Well, I'd say
it's mostly

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.733
the outstanding training
they've recei‐‐

00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.333
It's 'cause they
have great friends!

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.500
Go get 'em,
Zuzu and Yuya!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.266
Sic your opponents
like a Rottweiler!

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:49.033
Mrs. Sakaki, you must be
thrilled for your son.

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:51.433
I'm his biggest fan.

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:53.866
But that Reed Pepper
is a hot tamale!

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.800
And Dennis Macfield, too!

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.833

Although we lost our first duel
together,

00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:07.333
I feel it was a great experience
because we both learned so much

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:09.666
about friendship
and teamwork!

00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:11.733
The only thing I learned
from that debacle

00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:13.800
is how much
I hate losing.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.233
(gasps)
Huh?

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:16.633
Two Pendulum cards!

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:17.800
A sign
of good fortune!

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.800
A pair of cards for a pair
of inseparable friends!

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.000
I'll even let you choose
which one you'd

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.266
Where are they going?

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:27.100
It is as if the cards were
trying to escape from us!

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.400
Perhaps a genie has cast a spell
on them!

00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:39.700
We found you!

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.700
Huh?

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.066
They fell for it!

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:44.766
Hook, line, and sinker!
Ha ha ha!

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:47.100
I just made my best catch ever,
Reed!

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.833
Look what's for dinner!

00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:51.533
Hey!

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:52.833
What's cooking,
guys?

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:54.466
You looking
for a table for two?

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:56.600
'Cause if you are, it would be
my pleasure

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.800
to serve up some
culinary competition!

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.733
I hope you brought your
appetites with you!

00:03:03.733 --> 00:03:05.666
Reed Pepper!

00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:06.733
Oh!

00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:08.866
That Reed Pepper
is such a dreamboat!

00:03:08.866 --> 00:03:11.733
Any girl would gladly set sail
with him!

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:12.900
Heh heh heh!

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.533
Now I can reel in as many
duelists as I want.

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:17.566
After all,
I've got plenty of cards

00:03:17.566 --> 00:03:19.433
and Reed's the perfect
bait.

00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:21.500
I think you're
totally right, Trout.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.400
You were the missing ingredient
to my recipe for success.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.700
With your help,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.866
I know I'll get to the top
of the field in no time!

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.033
The key to fishing is
knowing how to be patient.

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:33.433
I'll keep
reeling in opponents

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:36.000
so that Reed can collect
their Pendulum cards.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.733
But the second I see
he's worn down from dueling,

00:03:38.733 --> 00:03:40.233
I'll pull a bait and switch

00:03:40.233 --> 00:03:42.666
and challenge Reed
to a one‐on‐one battle!

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:44.633
Once I win, I'll cast
him off

00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:47.200
and keep all the cards
for myself!

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.000
Ha ha ha!

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.366
Good luck,
partner!

00:03:50.366 --> 00:03:52.066
I'll be pullin'
for you!

00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:53.733
What's up with
the fisherman?

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.833
Why isn't he battling
in the duel?

00:03:55.833 --> 00:03:59.400
Letting Reed go it alone
makes zero strategic sense!

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.366
It's like playing
with half a deck!

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.433
Are you sure you still want
to go through with this?

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:04.733
You better believe it.

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:06.866
I can't wait
to get started!

00:04:06.866 --> 00:04:09.000
(computer)
Battle Royale mode engaged.

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:11.400
Ready?

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:13.700
Let's duel!

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.833
(announcer)
We're in for a wild one
in the Jungle Zone

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:18.500
as the king of the kitchen,
Reed Pepper, takes on

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.233
the tenacious tandem
of Halil and Olga!

00:04:21.233 --> 00:04:22.600
And what
have we here?

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.833
A solo duelist has just
entered the Volcano Zone!

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:27.466
A few moments ago,
it was erupting

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:30.633
with some of the most intense
dueling I've ever seen!

00:04:30.633 --> 00:04:32.200
Where's Yuya?

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.266
(young man)
Oh, he's already moved on
to another zone!

00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:36.933
Huh?

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.900
Hi!

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.233
Who're you?

00:04:41.233 --> 00:04:42.500
The name
is Dennis.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.066
I'm an exchange student
at the Leo Institute

00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:47.100
and a friend
of Yuya.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.833
You're friends?

00:04:48.833 --> 00:04:50.266
And how!

00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:55.366
Why, dueling can make
anybody friends!

00:04:55.366 --> 00:04:58.000
Do you mean that you
dueled against Yuya?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.233
We teamed up.

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:01.566
And we were
very successful.

00:05:01.566 --> 00:05:03.366
Yuya and I just beat
a pair of duelists

00:05:03.366 --> 00:05:06.566
from the Banded
Warrior Academy.

00:05:06.566 --> 00:05:09.933
I think we should duel so
we can become better friends.

00:05:09.933 --> 00:05:11.800
Don't you think,
Zuzu?

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.666
How do you know
who I am?

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:17.300
My passionate dream is to become
a great dueltainer someday.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.366
So you see, I'm familiar
with the You Show School

00:05:20.366 --> 00:05:22.766
and it's most enchanting
entertainer!

00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:26.866
What's he doing,
winking at my daughter?

00:05:26.866 --> 00:05:29.200
Maybe he just got something
stuck in his eye.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.433
This will be the most
romantic contest ever!

00:05:31.433 --> 00:05:33.566
It's more like a date
than a duel!

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:34.800
Zuzu's so lucky!

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.266
Lucky?

00:05:37.266 --> 00:05:39.200
You're interested
in dueling me, huh?

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.200
I guess it would be rude
to turn down a challenge

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.566
from an
aspiring dueltainer.

00:05:43.566 --> 00:05:45.033
So I accept.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.966
And to make things
even more interesting,

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:52.466
what if we each put two
Pendulum cards on the line

00:05:52.466 --> 00:05:54.133
for the winner?

00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:56.266
Mmm!
A great idea!

00:05:56.266 --> 00:05:58.100
Let's go for it!

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.833
And now without
further ado,

00:06:00.833 --> 00:06:01.933
Let's duel!

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:08.066
After you, Zuzu.

00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:09.233
No, thanks.

00:06:09.233 --> 00:06:10.966
I wanna see
what you can do.

00:06:10.966 --> 00:06:12.800
You go first,
Dennis.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.866
As you wish.

00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:16.400
Now then, let's begin!

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.333
It's a good thing
there are no monsters

00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:20.166
on either of our
fields...

00:06:20.166 --> 00:06:23.733
because I'm allowed to bring
this performer to the stage!

00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:28.333
Presenting the one and only
Performage Stilts Launcher!

00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:30.666
Then, after placing
one card facedown,

00:06:30.666 --> 00:06:32.833
I'm going to take things up
a notch...

00:06:32.833 --> 00:06:36.233
by placing
Pendulum Statue Yellow Scarab,

00:06:36.233 --> 00:06:38.800
directly in the Pendulum
Zone!

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.200
Why do that?

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.300
You need two Pendulum Cards to
Pendulum Summon, not just one.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.333
Because it allows me
to use

00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:47.333
Yellow Scarab's
Pendulum ability!

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:51.200
It bulks up my Stilts Launcher
by 300 attack points!

00:06:53.566 --> 00:06:54.433
I see.

00:06:54.433 --> 00:06:56.200
Pretty clever,
Dennis.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.866
Duels are a lot
more enticing

00:06:57.866 --> 00:07:00.366
when they're full of
unexpected twists and turns.

00:07:00.366 --> 00:07:02.700
You never know what'll
happen next.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.700
Plus, it makes your opponent
pay extra close attention!

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.033
Well, right now

00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:08.966
I'm guessing that you don't
have two Pendulum cards

00:07:08.966 --> 00:07:10.400
or you would have
used them both.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.500
If that's the case,
I need to make my move!

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.666
It's my turn!
Ha!

00:07:17.966 --> 00:07:21.100
Watch carefully as I use
my Scale 3 White Butterfly

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.900
and my Scale 9
White Flower

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.833
to set
the Pendulum Scale!

00:07:25.833 --> 00:07:27.000
Quick as a wink,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.166
I can summon monsters
from Levels 4 through 8

00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:32.266
all
at the same time!

00:07:32.266 --> 00:07:33.933
I Pendulum Summon!

00:07:33.933 --> 00:07:36.333
Take the stage,
girls!

00:07:38.466 --> 00:07:42.200
Give it up for Soprano
the Melodious Songstress!

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.633
And Tamtam
the Melodious Diva!

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.366
Thanks to Soprano, I can Fusion
Summon without Polymerization!

00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:56.433
Look and listen as she and
Tamtam fuse together!

00:07:56.433 --> 00:07:59.366
Now, ladies,
merge your might!

00:07:59.366 --> 00:08:03.700
Together you will create a new,
more powerful melodic monster!

00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:08.333
I Fusion Summon!

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:11.200
Bloom Diva,
the Melodious Choir!

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.566
Once again, Zuzu Boyle
wows the fans

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:22.500
with a pitch‐perfect
Fusion Summon!

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.566
Folks, this girl
is a natural!

00:08:25.566 --> 00:08:26.700
Hey!

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.533
I dig the moves
you're making!

00:08:28.533 --> 00:08:31.033
They're almost as
amazing as you are.

00:08:31.033 --> 00:08:32.400
Can we dial back
the drool

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.066
and get back
to the duel?

00:08:34.066 --> 00:08:35.933
Please forgive me.

00:08:35.933 --> 00:08:38.133
When I use Tamtam
to Fusion Summon,

00:08:38.133 --> 00:08:40.933
her special ability
activates!

00:08:40.933 --> 00:08:43.433
Now Bloom Diva's attack
points lower by 500

00:08:43.433 --> 00:08:46.866
and she then deals that
amount in damage to you!

00:08:51.966 --> 00:08:53.566
That was a warm up.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:56.800
Next, Bloom Diva will
perform her showstopper!

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.966
When she attacks,

00:08:57.966 --> 00:09:00.600
she can't be destroyed
by your Stilt Launcher.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.266
And instead of me
taking damage,

00:09:02.266 --> 00:09:04.966
you take the damage
that I was going to take!

00:09:04.966 --> 00:09:07.000
And for
her grand finale,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.333
your Stilts Launcher is
automatically destroyed!

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.866
I'd ask for an encore,
but I couldn't survive it.

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:29.133
You're knocking me out
with your moves,

00:09:29.133 --> 00:09:31.000
so I'd like
to return the favor!

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.233
I activate the Action Spell
Flame Ball to deal you damage!

00:09:34.233 --> 00:09:35.433
Heh, but not much.

00:09:35.433 --> 00:09:36.500
Wait...

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.733
If you think this is
an ordinary orb,

00:09:38.733 --> 00:09:41.333
you're in for
a staggering surprise.

00:09:41.333 --> 00:09:44.333
One, two, three!

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.200
Huh?

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.633
Aaah!

00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:57.700
Are you okay?

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.400
That Flame Ball was
more intense than usual

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.800
because I banished
Stilts Launcher.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.166
That let me pump up
Flame Ball's damage

00:10:04.166 --> 00:10:07.433
so it equaled the damage
I took from Bloom Diva.

00:10:07.433 --> 00:10:09.800
(announcer)
Tensions are building
in the Volcano Zone!

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.433
I can sense at any second these
duelists are gonna boil over

00:10:13.433 --> 00:10:15.966
like the magma
beneath their feet!

00:10:15.966 --> 00:10:17.200
Hurl those attacks!

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.100
Go, Dennis, go!

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.766
If you can serve up
a victory, Reed,

00:10:20.766 --> 00:10:23.666
I'll serve you snacks
I made for Frederick!

00:10:23.666 --> 00:10:24.666
Oooh!

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.100
Heads up!

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.766
As you can see, Yuya Sakaki is
entering the Ancient Ruins Zone!

00:10:36.733 --> 00:10:37.933
Shay!

00:10:37.933 --> 00:10:41.600
I'm glad I ran into you,
'cause I got a lot of questions.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.066
Starting
with Sora!

00:10:43.066 --> 00:10:44.800
And Duel Academy!

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.166
I have a question
for you, too.

00:10:47.166 --> 00:10:48.266
Huh?

00:10:48.266 --> 00:10:49.766
About Yuto.

00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:51.366
Where have you taken him?

00:10:51.366 --> 00:10:52.433
Yuto?

00:10:52.433 --> 00:10:54.433
Who is that guy?

00:10:54.433 --> 00:10:58.866
I know about the duel between
Yuto and that fusion freak Sora.

00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:00.966
The moment you stuck your nose
in their duel

00:11:00.966 --> 00:11:03.866
was the last anyone's
seen of Yuto!

00:11:03.866 --> 00:11:06.033
What did you do
with my best friend?

00:11:06.033 --> 00:11:07.666
Where is he, Yuya?

00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:09.633
I'm not sure‐‐
Don't play dumb!

00:11:09.633 --> 00:11:11.733
I know you were involved
in his disappearance!

00:11:11.733 --> 00:11:13.200
That much is clear!

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.433
Otherwise, try to explain
how you ended up

00:11:15.433 --> 00:11:18.966
with Yuto's Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon in your deck!

00:11:18.966 --> 00:11:21.366
You have it all wrong!

00:11:21.366 --> 00:11:23.700
I didn't steal
that card from him.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.200
He handed it over
to me!

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.666
Yuto gave
it to me.

00:11:27.666 --> 00:11:29.900
(man)
Ha ha! You left
your flank exposed.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.766
You will pay dearly for
letting your guard down.

00:11:32.766 --> 00:11:34.200
Slash
the Assault Knight,

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.333
make ready to strike down
your double!

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:38.133
Commence your assault!

00:11:41.633 --> 00:11:43.533
Your Knight showed
perfect form.

00:11:43.533 --> 00:11:46.000
But my Knight can
parry the blow easily!

00:11:49.866 --> 00:11:51.466
We're right in
their line of fire!

00:11:51.466 --> 00:11:54.333
These creeps are harder
to get rid of than rats.

00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:56.000
Careful!

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.600
Insults could very well
lead to your undoing.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.133
Yes, it will be
a shame

00:12:00.133 --> 00:12:02.900
if one of these blasts
accidently strikes you.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.900
Now then, Assault Knight,
ready your lance

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.133
and commence with
your attack!

00:12:11.033 --> 00:12:12.100
(both shouting)

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.300
A worthy attack,
good sir.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.933
Though, my monster
will shield me!

00:12:18.666 --> 00:12:19.966
They're battling
each other

00:12:19.966 --> 00:12:23.000
so that they can use their
attacks to try and take us out.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.066
Those snakes!

00:12:24.066 --> 00:12:26.600
Your accusation
is absurd.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.033
We were engaged in a three‐way
combat when you two intruded.

00:12:30.033 --> 00:12:32.166
If it is your desire
to stop us,

00:12:32.166 --> 00:12:33.700
then duel us again,

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.966
but unlike last time, your
ending will be a tragic one.

00:12:36.966 --> 00:12:38.166
Slash!

00:12:38.166 --> 00:12:41.833
Strike with furious fury
and show no mercy!

00:12:56.966 --> 00:12:58.633
Argh!

00:12:58.633 --> 00:13:00.300
Yaaaah!

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.933
(moaning)

00:13:07.033 --> 00:13:10.100
How can they get away with
attacking defenseless duelists?

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.300
Once again, we offer up the
chance to join our duel.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.500
I suggest you choose wisely...
or it could be your downfall!

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.533
Ha ha ha!

00:13:18.533 --> 00:13:21.500
(grunting)

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.433
Hey, Shay!

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.166
Who are they?

00:13:31.166 --> 00:13:33.466
They're not supposed to be
in the tournament.

00:13:37.466 --> 00:13:38.933
Sir!

00:13:38.933 --> 00:13:43.666
Cut off the public video feed
for that zone immediately!

00:13:43.666 --> 00:13:46.133
What happened?
Aw, man!

00:13:46.133 --> 00:13:47.033
Hey, where'd
the picture go?

00:13:47.033 --> 00:13:48.300
Come on,
I wanna see it.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.133
They stopped showing
the Ancient Ruins Zone.

00:13:50.133 --> 00:13:51.433
Uh, sorry!

00:13:51.433 --> 00:13:53.733
There appears to be
a slight glitchypoo

00:13:53.733 --> 00:13:56.233
with the Ancient Ruins
cam.

00:13:56.233 --> 00:13:58.666
Hey, whadya say we check out
the Volcano Zone

00:13:58.666 --> 00:14:00.833
where there's a
"lava" action going on?

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.266
Next, I'm gonna
hit the brakes

00:14:03.266 --> 00:14:06.700
by activating
the spell card Slow Tempo!

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.366
With this spell card, I'm
changing the pace of this duel

00:14:09.366 --> 00:14:10.733
and ruining your strategy

00:14:10.733 --> 00:14:13.866
because now, if you summon
a monster from your hand,

00:14:13.866 --> 00:14:15.700
it can't attack
during that turn.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.133
That means any monsters
I summon from my hand

00:14:18.133 --> 00:14:19.333
have to wait
to attack,

00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:21.600
further complicating
my efforts.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.600
Zuzu...

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.400
I love what
you've done!

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.433
Beating you will be
next to impossible.

00:14:26.433 --> 00:14:28.700
But I'm goin' for it!

00:14:29.733 --> 00:14:31.700
♪ Laaaaa! ♪

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.833
It's my chance to shine
in the spotlight!

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:36.466
The best way
to turn this duel around

00:14:36.466 --> 00:14:38.033
is by making
some big waves

00:14:38.033 --> 00:14:42.733
with my Scale 2 Blue Whale and
Scale 10 Yellow Scarab!

00:14:42.733 --> 00:14:45.900
I'll use 'em both
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.500
Now I can summon monsters
from Levels 3 through 9

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.166
at the same time!

00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:53.000
I Pendulum Summon!

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.600
Come on out‐‐

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.600
the wacky and wonderful
Performage Damage Juggler!

00:15:00.766 --> 00:15:05.533
And the fabulous fire‐guzzler,
Performage Flame Eater!

00:15:05.533 --> 00:15:08.800
I Overlay my Level 4 Damage
Juggler and Flame Eater

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.733
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.033
Way to go, guys!

00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:18.866
But you better keep
holding your breath, folks,

00:15:18.866 --> 00:15:22.966
'cause now we're gonna try and
make summoning history!

00:15:22.966 --> 00:15:26.500
I... Xyz Summon...

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.966
Performage Trapeze Magician!

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.900
This guy's full
of surprises!

00:15:39.666 --> 00:15:42.633
That's the girl Declan
was talking about.

00:15:42.633 --> 00:15:44.600
My
so‐called twin.

00:15:46.133 --> 00:15:48.933
What do those guys want?

00:15:48.933 --> 00:15:49.933
Huh?

00:15:49.933 --> 00:15:53.300
No way&amp;!

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.466
That's...

00:15:55.466 --> 00:15:57.566
Sora!

00:15:57.566 --> 00:16:01.200
You again.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.700
The two of us have unfinished
business, Shay,

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.233
but now I can
finally settle the score

00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:08.333
once and for all!

00:16:15.166 --> 00:16:16.233
(Yuya)
Sora!

00:16:16.233 --> 00:16:18.100
You're all right!
Where've you been?

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.900
Keep those three
knight‐nerds occupied.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.733
I'll take care of
the Xyzian myself.

00:16:21.733 --> 00:16:23.000
Sora!

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.066
Over here!
I know you see me!

00:16:25.066 --> 00:16:26.200
Ahh! Ahh!

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.000
I declare, that simpleton
insulted us!

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.066
Just who do these
scoundrels think they are?

00:16:31.066 --> 00:16:34.733
We are
Obelisk Force.

00:16:34.733 --> 00:16:37.266
(computer)
Battle Royal mode engaged.

00:16:42.366 --> 00:16:43.866
Get set!

00:16:43.866 --> 00:16:45.800
Okay,
Trapeze Magician!

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.366
Take a swing
at Bloom Diva!

00:16:50.533 --> 00:16:52.733
Didn't you learn
anything from earlier?

00:16:52.733 --> 00:16:54.766
Bloom Diva's gonna
destroy your monster

00:16:54.766 --> 00:16:56.466
and deal you damage!

00:16:56.466 --> 00:16:58.100
Let it rip,
Diva!

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.033
Oh, I know.

00:16:59.033 --> 00:17:01.166
If you knew, then why'd
you attack her?

00:17:01.166 --> 00:17:02.800
For the thrill of it!

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.800
Trapeze Magician
wants to show off!

00:17:07.133 --> 00:17:09.833
Thanks to my Magician's
special ability,

00:17:09.833 --> 00:17:12.366
my life points are protected
so I take no damage

00:17:12.366 --> 00:17:14.900
from your
sweet songstress!

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.533
That may win you
style points,

00:17:16.533 --> 00:17:19.266
but your Trapeze Magician's
still destroyed..

00:17:19.266 --> 00:17:20.300
Nuh‐uh!

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.900
I've got a cool trick
to show you!

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.500
One&amp; two&amp;

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.933
Three!

00:17:32.966 --> 00:17:33.866
Huh?

00:17:46.266 --> 00:17:47.200
Oh!

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.200
Excuse me,
what just happened?

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.333
I pulled a monster
switcheroo!

00:17:56.333 --> 00:17:59.466
I never attempted this stunt
during a duel before,

00:17:59.466 --> 00:18:03.333
but it worked like a charm,
thanks to my trap Trick Box!

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.733
Our two monsters switched
places,

00:18:05.733 --> 00:18:09.800
so what's mine is yours
and what's yours is now mine!

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.200
Diva's on your side?!

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.566
Exactly!

00:18:13.566 --> 00:18:15.466
Okay, Bloom Diva,

00:18:15.466 --> 00:18:18.666
serenade Trapeze Magician
with your favorite tune!

00:18:18.666 --> 00:18:19.766
Give
my star performer

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:22.466
the spectacular send‐off
he deserves!

00:18:22.466 --> 00:18:26.033
I want you to bring down the
house, and Zuzu along with it!

00:18:28.466 --> 00:18:30.766
(Zuzu screaming)

00:18:36.233 --> 00:18:38.566
(screaming)

00:18:40.266 --> 00:18:43.233
That song had more impact
than I expected!

00:18:43.233 --> 00:18:44.800
Hang on!

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:48.566
But, Dennis!

00:18:48.566 --> 00:18:50.233
You'll fall
into the lava, too!

00:18:50.233 --> 00:18:51.266
I think not!

00:18:51.266 --> 00:18:52.833
Our duel may be over,

00:18:52.833 --> 00:18:55.400
but I still have one
final trick up my sleeve!

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.500
So hang on tight,
Zuzu!

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.533
This is gonna
be close!

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.366
Nice catch,
my friend!

00:19:05.366 --> 00:19:07.166
Glad to have you
back on my team!

00:19:07.166 --> 00:19:08.766
(crowd cheering)

00:19:08.766 --> 00:19:11.766
(announcer)
Dennis Macfield pulls off a win
and a mid‐air rescue

00:19:11.766 --> 00:19:16.066
in one of the greatest displays
of dueltaining I've ever seen!

00:19:16.066 --> 00:19:18.000
Put my daughter
down!

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.866
And get a haircut
while you're at it!

00:19:19.866 --> 00:19:21.766
I think they're adorable
together.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.700
I never like
losing a duel.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.966
But it was definitely
fun.

00:19:27.966 --> 00:19:29.533
Agreed.

00:19:29.533 --> 00:19:30.666
But as fun as it was,

00:19:30.666 --> 00:19:33.566
our rematch will be
even more amazing!

00:19:33.566 --> 00:19:37.066
(Zuzu's "twin")
There isn't going
to be any rematch!

00:19:37.066 --> 00:19:40.566
That's because this next duel
will be your last!

00:19:40.566 --> 00:19:42.333
Huh?
Huh?

00:19:42.333 --> 00:19:45.866
I didn't know
you had a twin!

00:19:45.866 --> 00:19:48.100
She does look
just like me!

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.800
Could she be
Lulu?

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.933
(announcer)
Sorry, folks!

00:19:52.933 --> 00:19:55.466
Looks like someone forgot
to pay the cable bill!

00:19:55.466 --> 00:19:57.300
Ha ha ha ha!

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.333
We just cut the public feed for
the Volcano Zone, Mr. President.

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:04.100
The time for action
has finally arrived.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.733
You candidates have shown great
promise and potential.

00:20:06.733 --> 00:20:10.233
It's time to prove you have what
it takes to become Lancers!

00:20:16.133 --> 00:20:17.600
Sora!

00:20:18.533 --> 00:20:19.866
Shay!

00:20:19.866 --> 00:20:21.500
Don't leave without me!

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:26.366
(all groaning)

00:20:26.366 --> 00:20:27.700
Got 'em.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.700
Who knew duelists from Standard
would be such pushovers?

00:20:33.533 --> 00:20:34.666
Oh!

00:20:34.666 --> 00:20:35.933
All these people...

00:20:35.933 --> 00:20:38.733
I can feel their pain...
their suffering...

00:20:45.133 --> 00:20:47.300
Aaah!
What did you
do to him?

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.566
Bring him back!

00:20:48.566 --> 00:20:51.800
Why bring him back,
when you can join him?

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.733
Ready?

00:20:52.733 --> 00:20:54.233
Don't do it!

00:20:54.233 --> 00:20:55.866
Please,
no!

00:20:59.833 --> 00:21:03.066
Stop it!!

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:10.433
