WEBVTT

00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.600
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.933
All right,
who's ready to duel?

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:11.033
What's up,
Coach Y?

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:12.866
Wait, what are you
doing here?

00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.866
He came to meet you
for his first lesson.

00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.233
It's rude to keep your
students waiting, Yuya.

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:18.366
But he's not...

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.666
Whoa!

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:23.733
Yuya, I'm proud you chose to
enter‐train your first pup‐‐

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.200
Listen to me!
He's not my student!

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.566
Come on!
Let's get to it!

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.400
I wanna learn
how to Pendulum Summon

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.466
from the best
of the best.

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:35.766
Let's duel...
pretty please?

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.533
This one time only.

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.533
Whoo‐hoo!
But listen!

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.200
You have to promise
if I win

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.400
you'll stop following
me around everywhere.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.100
And you won't ask me
to teach you or call me coach.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.200
Agreed?

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.300
The action begins...

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.966
Now!
Now!

00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.733
I'll use Stargazer Magician
and Timegazer Magician

00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:59.833
to set the Pendulum Scale.

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:02.100
(roaring)

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.433
Then I'll use a spell.

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:06.766
It's a card called
Polymeri‐something‐or‐other.

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.800
You mean
Polymerization?

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.566
Fusion Summon!

00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.866
Here it comes.

00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:17.233
The most unbearable monster
you've ever seen...

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:18.766
Frightfur Bear!

(Sora)
This field sure is sweet Yuya,

00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:28.133
but not as sweet as
my victory's going to taste.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.266
(Yuya)
We'll see about that, Sora,

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:34.233
'cause with my monsters
ready to perform,

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:36.333
you're gonna end up
leaving this duel

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:38.966
with a bad taste
in your mouth.

00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:40.266
Not a chance!

00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:42.066
Your monsters are gonna
get cut down to size

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:44.666
by my Frightfur Bear.

00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:46.533
That kid's a cutie
on the outside,

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.400
but on the inside
he's all fight,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.533
plus he knows the secret to
an incredible form of summoning.

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:52.933
Yeah, he can...

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:55.133
(both)
Fusion Summon!

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.000
Word around town
is that the Leo Institute

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.933
has begun teaching
that form.

00:02:58.933 --> 00:03:01.566
Is Sora already enrolled
and taking classes there?

00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:03.333
He was planning
to go there,

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:06.666
but he saw Yuya duel
and changed his mind.

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:09.233
(Sora)
Now I can really
take it to you, Coach Y!

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:11.100
My first goal will be
to slow you down

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.300
by giving your
Hippo the heave‐ho!

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.800
Frightfur Bear, send Yuya
and his pal packing

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.566
with your
Pummeling Paw.

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:22.433
Ahh!

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:23.566
Yuya!

00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:25.100
Call a lifeguard!

00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:31.366
(chuckling)

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.400
(coughing)

00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:42.566
Next I'm activating Frightfur
Bear's special ability.

00:03:42.566 --> 00:03:43.833
My Bear can
equip itself

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:46.566
with whatever monster
it just destroyed.

00:03:46.566 --> 00:03:48.033
How's that work?

00:03:48.033 --> 00:03:49.700
We'll show you.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.100
Hip Hippo!

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.533
Don't feel bad 'cause my
Frightfur Bear

00:03:58.533 --> 00:04:00.766
will put its
attack points to good use.

00:04:00.766 --> 00:04:03.600
Down the hatch!

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.533
Your hippo really
hit the spot.

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:08.133
Its added attack power will help
my monster bear down on you

00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:10.133
with grizzly force.

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:11.333
(roaring)

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.933
Whoa!
That's one big bear.

00:04:14.933 --> 00:04:16.866
With the attack points
to match.

00:04:16.866 --> 00:04:18.233
That thing
is powerful enough

00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:20.333
to blast Yuya's Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:22.366
right out of the duel.

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:25.966
And once it destroys Odd‐Eyes,
it'll get even grizzlier!

00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:30.166
Who would've thought a toy bear
could be so unbearable?

00:04:31.866 --> 00:04:33.800
So, Coach Y, I know
I have a lot to learn,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.133
but what do you think of
my dueling so far?

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.933
I'll let you
take over.

00:04:39.933 --> 00:04:42.066
Don't take it
easy on me.

00:04:42.066 --> 00:04:44.833
I won't!

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:47.333
Your monster's a lot more
dangerous than I thought,

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:49.666
but my deck packs
a punch too, Sora.

00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:51.100
We have friends
that will help us

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.333
knock the stuffing out of that
Bear, don't we, Odd‐Eyes?

00:04:54.333 --> 00:04:56.433
Performapal Sword Fish
will prove it

00:04:56.433 --> 00:04:58.133
with its special ability.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.133
Once every turn, it can
cut your monster down to size

00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:05.266
by 600 attack points!

00:05:05.266 --> 00:05:06.766
Yuya's move pulled
the stuffing out of that bear

00:05:06.766 --> 00:05:09.100
and shrank it down
at the same time!

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.100
Now he has to attack
while it is weak.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.233
Listen, Odd‐Eyes,

00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:14.933
if we wanna beat
that Frightfur Bear

00:05:14.933 --> 00:05:17.600
then we'll have to
stay sharp.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.666
Ha! I'm ready
for your attack.

00:05:20.666 --> 00:05:22.666
I play my trap
Punch‐in‐the‐Box,

00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:24.666
which sends one of your
monsters that didn't attack

00:05:24.666 --> 00:05:26.233
to the graveyard.

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:27.733
Then Odd‐Eyes loses
attack points

00:05:27.733 --> 00:05:30.233
equal to that monster's
attack or defense points,

00:05:30.233 --> 00:05:32.100
plus your
attack's negated!

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.400
Nice try!

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.766
But my Timegazer Magician
can trump your trap

00:05:35.766 --> 00:05:37.900
with his Pendulum
ability.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.200
Timegazer has mastered

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.833
the deepest secrets
of space and time.

00:05:41.833 --> 00:05:46.400
Its power can protect me from
the past and rewrite history.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.533
Infinity Gear Reverse!

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.566
Fantastic!

00:05:52.566 --> 00:05:55.333
Pendulum power is so amazing,
it even controls time.

00:05:55.333 --> 00:05:56.966
That ability
would come in super handy

00:05:56.966 --> 00:05:58.966
if you went to school and then
realized too late

00:05:58.966 --> 00:06:02.433
that you'd forgotten
to bring your homework to class.

00:06:02.433 --> 00:06:04.500
I can't wait to see
what you come up with

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.666
to stop my other
trap card.

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:07.833
Uhh!

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:10.833
Okay, let's see what we
can spring on you next.

00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:13.566
It's another
Punch‐in‐the‐Box trap card.

00:06:13.566 --> 00:06:16.400
Seriously? The same trap
twice in a row?

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.800
I don't know
how Sora guessed,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.000
but somehow he knew Yuya would
try to undo his trap,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.866
so he put
another one facedown.

00:06:22.866 --> 00:06:24.966
Timegazer can only use his
ability once a turn,

00:06:24.966 --> 00:06:27.966
so he's helpless
to stop it this time.

00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:29.633
That kid sure is
slippery.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.966
Gotta send a card to the
graveyard now.

00:06:33.966 --> 00:06:35.766
Guess I'll send
Skeeter Skimmer.

00:06:42.666 --> 00:06:44.666
Now I can negate
Odd‐Eyes' attack.

00:06:44.666 --> 00:06:47.733
Plus I can draw on Skeeter
Skimmer's defense points

00:06:47.733 --> 00:06:50.600
to weaken your Dragon
by that amount.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.766
Odd‐Eyes will lose
1600 attack points.

00:06:52.766 --> 00:06:54.266
Better luck
next time!

00:06:58.433 --> 00:07:01.133
I'm switching my Sword Fish
into defense mode.

00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:09.000
You made up your mind to play it
safe, didn't you Coach Y?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.166
Bummerville‐‐ I thought this
duel would be a blast,

00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:13.800
but it's turned
into a dud.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.066
If I didn't
know any better,

00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:17.800
I'd say you were
scared of losing to me.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.000
I'm ending my turn, but that
doesn't mean I'm scared of you.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.533
You should be, since Frightfur
Bear's attack points

00:07:24.533 --> 00:07:28.333
can rise back to where they were
before Sword Fish weakened it.

00:07:31.533 --> 00:07:33.400
This could be
game over for Yuya.

00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:44.966
This could be
game over for Yuya.

00:07:44.966 --> 00:07:46.233
My turn again.

00:07:49.633 --> 00:07:51.933
It's time for
my big finish.

00:07:51.933 --> 00:07:54.133
Bring on
the Toy Parade.

00:07:54.133 --> 00:07:55.264
This spell is
spectacular!

00:07:55.264 --> 00:07:57.030
It's going to help me
march towards victory,

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.564
because for every monster that
Frightfur Bear has equipped,

00:07:59.564 --> 00:08:01.797
it's allowed to
use its Pulverizing Paw

00:08:01.797 --> 00:08:02.997
and attack one time.

00:08:02.997 --> 00:08:04.197
You're kidding!

00:08:04.197 --> 00:08:05.297
Whoa, back up!

00:08:05.297 --> 00:08:07.330
How many times
can he attack?

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
Right now, Sora's Frightfur Bear
is allowed to attack one time

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.797
since it gulped
down my Hip Hippo.

00:08:12.797 --> 00:08:17.130
But you and I know it's not
gonna stop there, will it, Sora?

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.964
Of course it won't.

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:20.830
I'll keep on
attacking.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.764
That's so freaky!

00:08:22.764 --> 00:08:24.364
When Frightfur Bear
destroys a monster,

00:08:24.364 --> 00:08:26.864
it can feast
on it and attack again.

00:08:26.864 --> 00:08:30.830
Then it can chomp on another
monster and equip that, too.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.464
Which will then mean Sora
gets a third attack.

00:08:33.464 --> 00:08:36.330
And since Yuya won't have any
more monsters left on his field

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.664
to absorb the damage...

00:08:38.664 --> 00:08:41.730
I'll attack him directly
and then win the duel!

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.930
Fusion Monsters are going to
revolutionize dueling.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.897
So, will Yuya lose?

00:08:49.897 --> 00:08:52.397
I wouldn't count him
out yet, Allie.

00:08:52.397 --> 00:08:55.097
Yuya can be
pretty resourceful.

00:08:55.097 --> 00:08:56.530
Now, let's see.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.964
Guess I'll start by knocking
your Odd‐Eyes out of the duel.

00:08:59.964 --> 00:09:01.530
(thinking)
If I don't think of
something fast,

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.897
Sora and that Bear are gonna
wipe out my whole field

00:09:03.897 --> 00:09:05.997
and then
come after me.

00:09:05.997 --> 00:09:07.630
There's not much time.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.430
If I let him
knock out Odd‐Eyes

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.530
things will spiral
out of control.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.530
I have to rescue
Odd‐Eyes now

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.197
or my monsters and
I are all going down.

00:09:17.197 --> 00:09:19.430
I only have
one chance.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.630
Hey, I know
what you're up to.

00:09:25.364 --> 00:09:27.197
Pick up the pace,
Odd‐Eyes!

00:09:32.164 --> 00:09:33.397
(gasping)

00:09:36.097 --> 00:09:37.630
Yeah!

00:09:40.297 --> 00:09:41.430
Oh, no!

00:09:47.164 --> 00:09:48.297
(gasping)

00:09:48.297 --> 00:09:49.630
(both)
No way!

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.964
Wow, what agility!

00:09:50.964 --> 00:09:53.697
That little acrobat must have
springs in his legs.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:57.797
You'll have to be
a lot quicker than that

00:09:57.797 --> 00:10:01.064
if you wanna snag an
Action Card before I do.

00:10:01.064 --> 00:10:03.130
That's why I took out
Hip Hippo first,

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.797
because I knew it
would slow you down.

00:10:05.797 --> 00:10:08.630
You had this all planned out
from the start, didn't you?

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.330
You wouldn't want me
to make it easy for you,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.697
would you, Coach Y?

00:10:12.697 --> 00:10:15.430
Hope not 'cause my Frightfur
Bear's about to track down

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.164
and destroy
your Odd‐Eyes.

00:10:17.164 --> 00:10:19.230
(growling)

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.630
No, it won't.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.664
I activate a trap‐‐
Command Performance.

00:10:23.664 --> 00:10:25.830
Whenever there's
a Performapal on my field,

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.264
this card switches your
monster into defense mode.

00:10:29.264 --> 00:10:32.064
This is the perfect time
to use an Action Card.

00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:34.164
I'm activating
my spell, Candy Coat.

00:10:36.264 --> 00:10:38.030
Thanks to the sweet power
of this spell,

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.930
my Bear is protected
from any trap

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.464
or spell effects
for this turn.

00:10:41.464 --> 00:10:44.964
And it shades my Bear
from being destroyed.

00:10:44.964 --> 00:10:46.964
It's lucky I grabbed
this card first.

00:10:46.964 --> 00:10:49.830
If I hadn't, you could've used
it to save your Odd‐Eyes

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.164
and foil my strategy.

00:10:52.164 --> 00:10:53.897
So close!

00:10:53.897 --> 00:10:57.097
Oh, well, Frightfur Bear,
finish your attack.

00:10:57.097 --> 00:10:58.130
Uh‐oh!

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.097
I've lost Odd‐Eyes.

00:11:07.097 --> 00:11:09.330
His Dragon's gone?

00:11:13.864 --> 00:11:15.730
(crying)

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:22.830
I'm sorry, Odd‐Eyes, I tried
to save you, but I failed.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.430
Cheer up!
It's not over yet!

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.097
You still have a few
life points left, Coach Y.

00:11:28.097 --> 00:11:30.064
Yes, but they won't
be enough.

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:31.964
None of us likes
getting beaten, of course,

00:11:31.964 --> 00:11:34.797
but Yuya will just have to
find a way to deal with it.

00:11:34.797 --> 00:11:37.064
That's not why
he's upset.

00:11:37.064 --> 00:11:38.297
Don't you understand

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:40.830
that Yuya feels a
special bond with Odd‐Eyes?

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.064
That dragon stands for
everything he loves

00:11:43.064 --> 00:11:45.264
about Pendulum cards.

00:11:45.264 --> 00:11:48.597
I can tell Yuya's really
not taking this well.

00:11:48.597 --> 00:11:49.830
Come on, Yuya!

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.130
You got to stand up
and take center stage!

00:11:54.997 --> 00:11:56.764
Yuya.

00:11:56.764 --> 00:11:58.564
Coach Y knows that there's
nothing he can do

00:11:58.564 --> 00:12:00.030
to stop me now.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.464
My Bear's gonna keep using his
own monsters against him.

00:12:03.464 --> 00:12:05.197
Go ahead,
Frightfur Bear,

00:12:05.197 --> 00:12:07.664
equip yourself with Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon.

00:12:18.064 --> 00:12:20.897
(crying)

00:12:20.897 --> 00:12:22.364
Where could it be?

00:12:22.364 --> 00:12:24.430
Something wrong, Yuya?

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:29.597
Dad! I lost my necklace
and I can't find it anywhere.

00:12:29.597 --> 00:12:34.197
I see, well, I'd be upset too,
but, in a situation like this,

00:12:34.197 --> 00:12:37.664
hanging your head and crying
isn't the answer.

00:12:37.664 --> 00:12:39.364
Hey, listen to me, Yuya.

00:12:39.364 --> 00:12:41.197
If you really want to
find what you've lost,

00:12:41.197 --> 00:12:43.497
then you've got to
hold your head up.

00:12:43.497 --> 00:12:46.630
Stay positive and good
things will happen.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.797
It's hopeless!

00:12:48.797 --> 00:12:50.497
Come on,
give it a try.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.264
Dad, look!

00:13:00.764 --> 00:13:03.097
See, it worked,
didn't it, Yuya?

00:13:05.264 --> 00:13:07.130
I haven't
forgotten, Dad.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.064
"Stay positive and
good things will happen."

00:13:11.764 --> 00:13:13.530
(laughing)

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.697
(thinking)
Dad knew what he was
talking about.

00:13:19.697 --> 00:13:21.797
If I just worry about
what I lost,

00:13:21.797 --> 00:13:24.097
I'll miss the fun
that's right in front of me.

00:13:24.097 --> 00:13:28.530
I have to hold my head high and
enjoy the ride while it lasts.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:29.930
No matter how
things turn out,

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.730
at least I'll have a good time,
and so will my fans.

00:13:41.197 --> 00:13:43.630
What's going on?

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.830
My extra deck!

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.364
I'm sure I didn't have
any cards there before,

00:13:47.364 --> 00:13:49.730
but then why's
the tab flashing?

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.364
Only one way
to find out.

00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:03.975
(Yuya)
You can search all you want,

00:14:03.975 --> 00:14:06.641
but your Bear's gonna keep
coming up empty‐handed!

00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:08.408
Huh?
Why's that?

00:14:08.408 --> 00:14:10.541
Where did your Odd‐Eyes
disappear to?

00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:12.108
When Odd‐Eyes
was destroyed,

00:14:12.108 --> 00:14:15.208
it didn't end up
in the graveyard.

00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:18.175
It's with me,
here in my extra deck!

00:14:20.575 --> 00:14:21.841
(gasping)

00:14:21.841 --> 00:14:24.275
In your extra deck?

00:14:24.275 --> 00:14:27.808
Well, that's some
bad news for me.

00:14:27.808 --> 00:14:28.875
(chuckling)

00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:31.041
(laughing)

00:14:31.041 --> 00:14:32.275
Huh?

00:14:32.275 --> 00:14:33.675
Awesome!

00:14:33.675 --> 00:14:35.241
That's so cool, coach.

00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:37.108
So, a destroyed
Pendulum monster,

00:14:37.108 --> 00:14:39.008
instead of going
to the graveyard,

00:14:39.008 --> 00:14:41.175
ends up in
your extra deck?

00:14:41.175 --> 00:14:43.108
I never would've
guessed that.

00:14:43.108 --> 00:14:45.475
Pendulum monsters
are totally amazing!

00:14:45.475 --> 00:14:47.041
Since Odd‐Eyes isn't
in the graveyard,

00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:50.741
I can't equip it to my bear,
which means it can't attack.

00:14:50.741 --> 00:14:51.808
You stopped me!

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:53.108
Turn over.

00:14:53.108 --> 00:14:55.608
Coach Y,
it's your move.

00:14:55.608 --> 00:14:56.708
Please make it
a fun one!

00:14:56.708 --> 00:14:58.175
All right!

00:14:58.175 --> 00:15:01.441
Then brace yourself for a battle
that's gonna blow you away.

00:15:03.541 --> 00:15:05.875
Great, I couldn't have
drawn a better card.

00:15:08.275 --> 00:15:09.375
Attention!

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:11.308
I'd like to present
my two Magicians,

00:15:11.308 --> 00:15:13.408
Stargazer and Timegazer.

00:15:13.408 --> 00:15:18.175
Before your very eyes, I'll use
them to set the Pendulum Scale.

00:15:18.175 --> 00:15:19.208
Presto!

00:15:19.208 --> 00:15:20.708
I can now
summon monsters

00:15:20.708 --> 00:15:24.408
from level two through level
seven all at the same time.

00:15:26.575 --> 00:15:27.941
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:15:27.941 --> 00:15:30.341
Carve the arc
of victory.

00:15:32.375 --> 00:15:36.175
Pendulum Summon!

00:15:36.175 --> 00:15:38.875
And now, I'd like to
introduce a Pendulum monster

00:15:38.875 --> 00:15:41.475
who you never
met before.

00:15:41.475 --> 00:15:43.941
Performapal Cheer Mole!

00:15:50.175 --> 00:15:52.208
But wait,
that's not all!

00:15:55.741 --> 00:15:57.741
I'm also bringing back
a crowd fave,

00:15:57.741 --> 00:16:00.408
my Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon.

00:16:04.408 --> 00:16:05.708
(roaring)

00:16:09.775 --> 00:16:10.975
Ahh!

00:16:12.441 --> 00:16:14.675
I just knew Yuya would figure
out a way for his Odd‐Eyes

00:16:14.675 --> 00:16:16.675
to get in
the spotlight again.

00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:19.341
So, no matter how many times
Yuya's opponents destroy it,

00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:21.708
Odd‐Eyes won't be sent
to the graveyard.

00:16:21.708 --> 00:16:25.241
And Yuya can summon it back
over and over and over again.

00:16:25.241 --> 00:16:26.708
Pendulum Power!

00:16:26.708 --> 00:16:28.975
It's got me more
excited than ever!

00:16:28.975 --> 00:16:31.475
I'm totally fired up!

00:16:31.475 --> 00:16:34.841
Odd‐Eyes is set, and so is
our supporting cast.

00:16:34.841 --> 00:16:37.108
And now, friends,
without further ado,

00:16:37.108 --> 00:16:39.341
let's get on
with the duel.

00:16:39.341 --> 00:16:40.375
(roaring)

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:43.075
Our lead act is
Performapal Sword Fish,

00:16:43.075 --> 00:16:44.541
who will show off
its ability

00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:49.241
by slashing the attack points
of your Frightfur Bear by 600!

00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:52.441
Guys! Can you help me out
with some basic arithmetic?

00:16:52.441 --> 00:16:54.508
3,000 minus 600.

00:16:54.508 --> 00:16:56.541
(all)
2400.

00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:59.941
Odd‐Eyes is now a hundred points
stronger than Frightfur Bear.

00:16:59.941 --> 00:17:02.708
It can send that Bear
back to the toy store.

00:17:02.708 --> 00:17:04.541
That's correct!

00:17:04.541 --> 00:17:06.541
My Punch‐in‐the‐Box trap
is still on the field,

00:17:06.541 --> 00:17:08.675
but Timegazer could
just negate it again,

00:17:08.675 --> 00:17:10.975
so I can't use it
to stop you.

00:17:10.975 --> 00:17:14.441
No matter what I try, Frightfur
Bear will lose the battle.

00:17:14.441 --> 00:17:16.008
Correct again.

00:17:16.008 --> 00:17:17.075
Hold on!

00:17:17.075 --> 00:17:18.641
If you destroy
Frightfur Bear,

00:17:18.641 --> 00:17:20.608
I'll still only take
a hundred points of damage.

00:17:20.608 --> 00:17:24.108
That's not enough to
knock me out of the duel.

00:17:24.108 --> 00:17:26.775
With my "Mole Move,"
it will be.

00:17:26.775 --> 00:17:27.975
Huh?

00:17:27.975 --> 00:17:29.741
And now,
Performapal Cheer Mole

00:17:29.741 --> 00:17:31.975
will perform her
special ability.

00:17:34.241 --> 00:17:36.775
Oh, come on,
it's no time to be shy.

00:17:36.775 --> 00:17:39.308
I got spirit,
yes I do.

00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:42.208
I got spirit,
how 'bout you?

00:17:45.875 --> 00:17:47.075
How cute!

00:17:51.108 --> 00:17:53.041
Cheer Mole strengthens
Sword Fish's special ability

00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:56.275
so that instead of Sword Fish
lowering Frightfur Bear's

00:17:56.275 --> 00:18:00.441
attack points by 600,
it lowers it by 1600.

00:18:08.241 --> 00:18:10.041
Ahh!

00:18:10.041 --> 00:18:13.275
You wanted this to be fun,
so how do you like this?

00:18:13.275 --> 00:18:15.641
Since Frightfur Bear
is level five or higher,

00:18:15.641 --> 00:18:17.975
Odd‐Eyes can use
its special ability

00:18:17.975 --> 00:18:19.841
to double the damage
you take.

00:18:19.841 --> 00:18:21.941
Now, the grand finale!

00:18:21.941 --> 00:18:24.475
So, get ready.

00:18:24.475 --> 00:18:27.608
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon,
get set to strike and make this

00:18:27.608 --> 00:18:29.875
the most sensational
finish ever.

00:18:32.208 --> 00:18:33.708
(roaring)

00:18:37.041 --> 00:18:39.108
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:18:46.541 --> 00:18:48.308
That's a wrap!

00:18:58.275 --> 00:19:00.175
(Yuya)
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:19:07.541 --> 00:19:09.275
That's a wrap!

00:19:15.441 --> 00:19:16.775
And it's over!

00:19:16.775 --> 00:19:17.672
That was the funnest
duel ever!

00:19:17.672 --> 00:19:18.805
Oh, yeah!

00:19:25.139 --> 00:19:26.439
Huh?

00:19:32.705 --> 00:19:34.872
Hmm...

00:19:34.872 --> 00:19:36.905
Sora, I think you may be
the most clever opponent

00:19:36.905 --> 00:19:39.005
I've ever faced.

00:19:39.005 --> 00:19:42.139
It's clear you don't need
any coaching from me‐‐

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:43.472
What a blast!

00:19:43.472 --> 00:19:45.905
That duel
totally rocked!

00:19:45.905 --> 00:19:48.372
Thank you, Yuya!
Huh?

00:19:48.372 --> 00:19:51.305
Yuya? You're not
calling me "coach" anymore?

00:19:51.305 --> 00:19:53.372
Well, you don't want me
to be your student.

00:19:53.372 --> 00:19:56.239
So, instead, I'll become
your best friend.

00:19:56.239 --> 00:19:57.372
And of course,
that means

00:19:57.372 --> 00:19:59.072
we'll be hanging
together all the time.

00:19:59.072 --> 00:20:00.372
Look, you're not
my best‐‐

00:20:00.372 --> 00:20:01.705
Great duel, guys!

00:20:01.705 --> 00:20:03.605
Since Sora here
is your best bud,

00:20:03.605 --> 00:20:05.872
I'm gonna discount
his tuition.

00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:08.839
You are enrolling in the
You Show School, aren't you?

00:20:08.839 --> 00:20:10.972
You bet!
After today's duel,

00:20:10.972 --> 00:20:14.139
I wouldn't sign up at the
Leo Institute for anything.

00:20:14.139 --> 00:20:15.372
Yes!

00:20:15.372 --> 00:20:16.805
Another new student,
which means maybe

00:20:16.805 --> 00:20:19.139
I can pay this
month's electric bill.

00:20:19.139 --> 00:20:20.239
I'll go get your
signup forms!

00:20:20.239 --> 00:20:21.505
I don't get it.

00:20:21.505 --> 00:20:23.172
If you never studied
at the Leo Institute,

00:20:23.172 --> 00:20:26.039
then where did you learn
to Fusion Summon?

00:20:26.039 --> 00:20:29.305
Where I come from, Fusion
Summoning is really common.

00:20:29.305 --> 00:20:31.372
Everybody uses it.

00:20:31.372 --> 00:20:32.772
Wait, you're not
from here?

00:20:32.772 --> 00:20:35.372
So, then, like,
where did you grow up?

00:20:35.372 --> 00:20:37.939
Oh, I'm too hungry to
talk about it right now.

00:20:37.939 --> 00:20:40.272
Let's go to your house for
dinner, okay, pal?

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:42.039
To my house?

00:20:42.039 --> 00:20:46.639
Look, I'm not sure this whole
friendship thing is a good idea.

00:20:46.639 --> 00:20:49.905
And afterwards,
wanna watch a movie?

00:20:49.905 --> 00:20:52.305
Go away!

00:20:52.305 --> 00:20:53.572
Or maybe
instead of a movie,

00:20:53.572 --> 00:20:55.672
we can go to the mall
or play a video game.

00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:57.372
I have a great
game for you‐‐

00:20:57.372 --> 00:21:00.205
it's called
leave me alone!

00:23:03.439 --> 00:23:06.472
