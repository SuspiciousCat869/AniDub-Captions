(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.833
I duel tomorrow, against someone
from the Leo Institute.

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:09.066
A Leo duelist?

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.100
Which one?

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.900
Some guy named
Shay Obsidian.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.333
(gasping)

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.800
See for yourself.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.033
(Yuya)
That guy?

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:17.266
(Zuzu)
He's dueling
for Leo now?

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.533
You say you're
willing to duel me,

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.933
but only if I enter
the championship?

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.200
Correct.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.433
That event will help us
to single out those duelists

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:30.033
who are the best
of the best...

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:32.966
to join my fight
against Leo Akaba.

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.666
You're battling
your father?

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.366
He's also our
common enemy

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.800
and I will stop at
nothing to take him down.

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.800
Sora Perse.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.766
Got it.

(loud chatter)

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.333
(woman)
This Championship's
been amazing!

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:56.333
That last duel was so exciting
I'm still shaking from it.

00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.266
(man)
And they're
only getting started!

00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:00.166
(man)
If the competition's
already this fierce,

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:02.366
the match ahead
will blow us away!

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:04.500
Right‐‐ These duelists
are even better

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.733
than last year's!

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:08.633
I can't wait to see
this next duel.

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:11.800
It's time for
today's third mega match up!

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.466
It's You Show School's
Sora Perse

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:17.933
versus Leo
Institute's Shay Obsidian.

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:22.000
Ladies and gentlemen, give it
up for Sora and Shay!

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.200
Oh, yeah!

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.166
Sora!

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:26.200
C'mon, Sora!

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.400
You can make
it three in a row!

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.066
Let's go, You Show!

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.700
We are the best!

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.133
Better than
the rest!

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:34.633
And I'm gonna prove it by
putting on the best show ever

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:36.533
and taking down the
competition!

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:37.866
You Show
is the best!

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:39.433
You Show is the best!

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:43.366
Yeah Sor‐‐

00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:44.366
There's our
friend.

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:49.400
I can't believe Shay's
dueling for the Leo Institute

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.933
after all the drama
he had with Julia.

00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:54.000
The whole thing
doesn't make sense.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.266
Shay was the one who attacked
Julia's professor

00:02:56.266 --> 00:02:59.300
and all those
LID students.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.366
Julia wanted
to make him pay.

00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:04.700
I've never seen anyone so
determined to take someone down.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.633
I don't know what happened
between them in that duel

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:10.066
but when I saw that Shay was
dueling for Julia's school,

00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:14.266
she acted like nothing
was ever wrong between them.

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:17.100
Julia, I know you don't like
me and all, but I gotta warn
you!

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.233
There's this
guy named Shay

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:20.733
who infiltrated LID's
tournament team!

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:23.400
Shay's been at
the institute all year.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.800
He was in my Advanced Dueling
Linguistics class last semester.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.833
It's as if something happened
to totally change Julia.

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:34.633
Like someone's been
messing with her memories...

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:36.733
You're right.

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:39.766
Something weird's
definitely going on here.

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:42.833
I saw Shay take on Leo
students first hand.

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:44.833
More Leo thugs!

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:48.933
This is my
lucky day.

00:03:48.933 --> 00:03:51.633
Okay, what's going on?

00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:53.566
That could be
the guy we're after!

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.933
I Xyz Summon!

00:03:55.933 --> 00:03:57.800
(roaring)

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.100
(screaming)

00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:06.933
That Xyz Monster
Shay summoned...

00:04:06.933 --> 00:04:10.866
It knocked me around
like it was real or something.

00:04:10.866 --> 00:04:14.066
Sora, be careful, don't
let your guard down!

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:15.966
Don't you worry!

00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:19.133
Just sit back, relax
and enjoy the show.

00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:21.333
It's my turn
to entertain you.

00:04:23.866 --> 00:04:27.166
We created these Pendulum
Cards just for you.

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:29.133
Take them, Shay.

00:04:29.133 --> 00:04:32.766
You should be able to do
more with them than Sylvio did.

00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:34.533
I don't
need them.

00:04:34.533 --> 00:04:36.633
Hey, get
back here!

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:42.500
He should've taken those
cards you made him.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.033
It's fine, Claude.

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:46.366
For now I prefer to
assess his duel skills

00:04:46.366 --> 00:04:48.900
rather than see how our
Pendulum Cards perform

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.200
in another field test.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.700
The third match of
the day is about to begin!

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.433
So watch as our Action Field
spins, spins, spins!

00:05:02.433 --> 00:05:05.433
Looks like we'll be
battling in Neo Heartland
City!

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:06.966
What?

00:05:06.966 --> 00:05:09.100
What better setting
for a duo of duelists

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.400
leading the way to
the future?

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.633
And now, let's
get to the action!

00:05:14.633 --> 00:05:17.300
Neo Heartland City
activate.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.400

Isn't it beautiful?

00:05:44.866 --> 00:05:47.333
It's like we're inside a
science fiction movie,

00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:48.433
right Frederick.

00:05:48.433 --> 00:05:49.566
Ja!

00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:52.066
It gives me goose pickles...
from the future!

00:05:56.466 --> 00:05:58.800
The only way this place
could be any sweeter

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.800
was if it was
made out o'candy,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.500
but the crowd seems to
be eatin' it up,

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.300
so I guess I'll make the best
of it 'til I win the duel.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.400
Ready?

00:06:12.433 --> 00:06:15.100
I knew this would be a
perfect setting for him.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.400
I don't understand
Mr. President.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.833
Well you might say, this field
is a present from me to Shay...

00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:23.700
to help him get his
game face on.

00:06:26.766 --> 00:06:28.233
What's
the matter, Shay?

00:06:28.233 --> 00:06:30.100
You feeling sick
or something?

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.533
You wanna take a break
an' duel later maybe?

00:06:33.533 --> 00:06:36.800
Don't worry about me,
just worry about yourself!

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.866
Fusion Summoners like
you deserve no mercy,

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:42.666

I got my fans
stoked, Shay.

You should do the same.

00:07:34.486 --> 00:07:36.320
What's wrong?
Now's your chance.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.320
Don't you want your
fans psyched up?

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.753
We're in
show business...

00:07:39.753 --> 00:07:41.486
Gotta create
excitement.

00:07:41.486 --> 00:07:43.420
Amp up the
entertainment value.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.120

the third magnificent match

00:08:19.453 --> 00:08:20.686
<i>of the day!</i>

00:08:20.686 --> 00:08:23.020
Your fate is
now in your hands.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.820
Then I'll start
the show.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.220
It's my pleasure to
introduce a cuddly star

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.086
direct from my hand, my
friend, Fluffal Bear!

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.886
(crowd)
Cute!

00:08:37.886 --> 00:08:39.553
Just wait,
there's more!

00:08:39.553 --> 00:08:41.286
If you think this
one's cute,

00:08:41.286 --> 00:08:43.720
just wait'll you
see what's coming next!

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.120
When Fluffal Bear's
front and center,

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.453
I can summon this little
barnyard buddy to join it.

00:08:49.453 --> 00:08:52.753
And since I have two,
they're twice as nice!

00:08:52.753 --> 00:08:55.486
I'm summoning out
two Fluffal Sheep!

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.320
(crowd)
Too cute!

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.953
I think the crowd's
pretty happy with that.

00:09:03.953 --> 00:09:05.653
Now, it's your
turn, Shay.

00:09:05.653 --> 00:09:07.986
Make sure you summon out
some real headliners.

00:09:07.986 --> 00:09:12.053
Let's make this the funnest
show anybody here's ever seen!

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.486
The funnest show
they've ever seen?

00:09:16.486 --> 00:09:19.353
The days of dueling for
fun no longer exist

00:09:19.353 --> 00:09:21.020
for me and my friends.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.653
Dueling is
about survival.

00:09:24.953 --> 00:09:27.553
The joy and happiness,

00:09:27.553 --> 00:09:30.320
the sounds of people
laughing and cheering.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.620
It was all taken
away that day,

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.753
replaced with a
deafening silence.

00:09:35.753 --> 00:09:38.020
Nothing could have
prepared us.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.353
It happened
too quickly.

00:09:40.353 --> 00:09:43.153
They just showed up,
they wrecked our city,

00:09:43.153 --> 00:09:45.486
changing our lives
forever.

00:09:45.486 --> 00:09:48.320
The enemy took everything
away from us.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.720
(Sora)
<i>What city?</i>

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.353
Who was
this enemy?

00:09:51.353 --> 00:09:53.586
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:09:53.586 --> 00:09:55.053
Yeah, Gong don't
know either!

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:56.653
Don't make sense.

00:09:56.653 --> 00:09:59.220
I think I know what
he's talking about!

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.086
Bring it!

00:10:01.086 --> 00:10:02.320
Shay, no!

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.786
This won't
solve anything!

00:10:06.786 --> 00:10:08.320
I told you
before.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.453
This isn't
our battlefield!

00:10:10.453 --> 00:10:11.920
You have to
trust me.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.886
This isn't the way
to go about this.

00:10:14.886 --> 00:10:17.486
You better believe
it's a battlefield!

00:10:17.486 --> 00:10:19.020
What does
that mean?

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.886
I'm not sure,
but maybe dueling

00:10:20.886 --> 00:10:24.086
is more than just fun
and games to him.

00:10:24.086 --> 00:10:25.953
He sure is acting a
lot more intense

00:10:25.953 --> 00:10:27.753
than the Shay
we're used to.

00:10:27.753 --> 00:10:28.753
Yeah.

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:29.886
But when you
think about it,

00:10:29.886 --> 00:10:31.320
what do we really know
about him anyway,

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.220
like where's he from?

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.153
Way to bring
the house down.

00:10:35.153 --> 00:10:37.420
I summon three of
the cutest monsters ever

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.520
so I can get the crowd
all jazzed up

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.186
and you come on like the
world's biggest Debbie Downer.

00:10:42.186 --> 00:10:44.486
Man, you're a real
spoil sport.

00:10:44.486 --> 00:10:46.720
We're following two
major duels here, dude.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.986
We gotta work hard if
we're gonna top those!

00:10:48.986 --> 00:10:50.553
I can't do
it alone!

00:10:50.553 --> 00:10:53.286
Teamwork was the only
way we could survive.

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:54.853
(Sora)
Here we go...

00:10:54.853 --> 00:10:57.486
We stood true against
the overwhelming odds

00:10:57.486 --> 00:10:59.020
but to no avail.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.753
Countless were
taken on that dark day.

00:11:02.753 --> 00:11:05.486
So are you gonna
duel or not?

00:11:05.486 --> 00:11:07.520
Oh, I'll
duel all right.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.520
I summon Raidraptor
Vanishing Lanius!

00:11:17.286 --> 00:11:19.220
It's that
same monster!

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.653
Now time to battle.

00:11:20.653 --> 00:11:22.520
Raidraptor
Vanishing Lanius,

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.553
swoop in and take out
his Fluffal Bear!

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.320
I loved that bear!

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.553
(crying)

00:11:35.553 --> 00:11:38.886
Nice, but my Bear's not
gonna be gone for long.

00:11:38.886 --> 00:11:41.786
Courtesy of my trap
card, Fluffal Crane!

00:11:47.453 --> 00:11:49.820
Not only does it give
me my Bear back,

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.186
but it also lets
me draw another card!

00:11:53.186 --> 00:11:57.586
You better think fast, Shay,
if you wanna keep up.

00:11:57.586 --> 00:12:00.120
Oh I'm not too
worried about that.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.386
I activate
Raidraptor Symbol.

00:12:02.386 --> 00:12:04.520
Since my Raid Raptor
battled your monster...

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.553
I can add a Raid Raptor
to my hand.

00:12:09.486 --> 00:12:11.520
So I choose...

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.186
Another Raidraptor
Vanishing Lanius.

00:12:14.186 --> 00:12:16.353
Since I already
summoned a Raid Raptor,

00:12:16.353 --> 00:12:18.653
Vanishing Lanius
earlier this turn...

00:12:18.653 --> 00:12:21.553
my second Lanius joins
it on the front line!

00:12:21.553 --> 00:12:22.720
But this time...

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.920
I summon it
in defense mode.

00:12:27.086 --> 00:12:29.020
Well, you move fast.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.586
But it doesn't matter how
many monsters you line up.

00:12:31.586 --> 00:12:33.820
I'm still gonna
beat you.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.086
We'll just
see about that.

00:12:36.086 --> 00:12:38.320
I end my turn.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.920
(Nico Smiley)
Well, the duelists have both
brought out dual duel monsters

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.420
<i>with the same name!</i>

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.286
Looks like they're
evenly matched, so far!

00:12:46.286 --> 00:12:48.420
But they're just
getting started.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.420
Who knows what
will happen next?

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.620
The mighty
match‐up between Sora Perse

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.086
and Shay Obsidian
has begun,

00:13:02.086 --> 00:13:04.286
but which warrior
will walk away the winner?

00:13:04.286 --> 00:13:05.753
That's an easy one.

00:13:05.753 --> 00:13:08.686
The winner's gonna wind up
being whoever dueltains best!

00:13:08.686 --> 00:13:11.753
And I'll do whatever it
takes to make sure that's
me!

00:13:11.753 --> 00:13:13.120
Now, it's
my turn.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.086
<i>Let's do this!</i>

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:17.686
First up, I summon a monster
that's sheer delight.

00:13:19.086 --> 00:13:20.653
Edge Imp Sabres!

00:13:22.953 --> 00:13:24.586
This monster's special ability

00:13:24.586 --> 00:13:26.520
lets me swap
a Fluffal monster

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.420
on my field with a different
Fluffal monster in my hand!

00:13:32.853 --> 00:13:34.120
Now watch what
happens

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.586
when my super‐cute
little lamb gets sheared!

00:13:42.053 --> 00:13:43.453
His beary's back!

00:13:43.453 --> 00:13:44.686
Awesome!

00:13:44.686 --> 00:13:46.320
The bear's
my favorite!

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.186
It looks really
cuddly!

00:13:48.186 --> 00:13:50.220
I hope
the sheep's okay!

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.086
Since Fluffal Sheep
returned to my hand,

00:13:52.086 --> 00:13:54.886
its special ability let's me
draw a card from my deck.

00:13:54.886 --> 00:13:59.286
And the card I got is
the sweet spell Polymerization!

00:13:59.286 --> 00:14:01.520
(groaning, gasping)

00:14:08.153 --> 00:14:13.086
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's showtime!

00:14:13.086 --> 00:14:16.886
Sora's sounding a lot
like his teammate, Yuya Sakaki!

00:14:18.886 --> 00:14:20.553
The spotlight's his....

00:14:20.553 --> 00:14:23.886
You know, I think he
really looks up to you, Yuya.

00:14:23.886 --> 00:14:26.586
Give yourselves a hand,
duel‐tastic crowd.

00:14:26.586 --> 00:14:29.820
You deserve to witness
my primo Fusion Summon!

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:30.953
Oh, please.

00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:33.253
That You Show show off
is so smug.

00:14:33.253 --> 00:14:35.253
I can't wait to
watch him get schooled.

00:14:35.253 --> 00:14:36.620
Just you wait.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.753
The real showstarts
right now.

00:14:39.753 --> 00:14:45.386
I'll begin by fusing Edge Imp
Sabres with my Fluffal Bear!

00:14:45.386 --> 00:14:48.453
Edge of sharpness
and fury of bear!

00:14:48.453 --> 00:14:52.353
When the two come together,
you had better beware!

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.486
I Fusion Summon!

00:14:55.486 --> 00:14:56.886
Here it comes!

00:14:56.886 --> 00:14:59.686
It's the most unbearable
monster you've ever seen...

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.286
It truly is a cut
above the rest!

00:15:04.286 --> 00:15:06.086
Frightfur Bear!

00:15:06.086 --> 00:15:08.253
Man, that monster
really looks sharp!

00:15:08.253 --> 00:15:11.386
It makes me want
to cut a rug!

00:15:11.386 --> 00:15:13.986
All right, let's
go on with the show!

00:15:13.986 --> 00:15:16.020
Frightfur Bear,
attack!

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.186
Ach du lie‐Bear!

00:15:23.186 --> 00:15:25.586
The Bear just cut
away 900 life points!

00:15:25.586 --> 00:15:28.453
Frightfur Bear does so much
more than just pummel and pound!

00:15:28.453 --> 00:15:30.320
It can equip itself
with whatever monster

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.686
it just destroyed!

00:15:37.553 --> 00:15:39.853
So now Vanishing Lanius's
attack points

00:15:39.853 --> 00:15:46.853
get added
to Frightfur Bear.

00:15:46.853 --> 00:15:52.020
That Bear is scary
strong now!

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.986
I activate the trap
Raidraptor Return!

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.653
Now the Raid Raptor
that was destroyed

00:15:59.653 --> 00:16:00.720
comes back to my hand!

00:16:07.286 --> 00:16:09.120
That was
too easy.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.453
It was like he was waiting
for that to happen.

00:16:11.453 --> 00:16:13.786
Gong does not
like this guy one bit.

00:16:13.786 --> 00:16:15.386
I'd guess I'd be
disappointed

00:16:15.386 --> 00:16:17.853
if you didn't keep
the show interesting.

00:16:17.853 --> 00:16:20.186
I place one card
facedown.

00:16:20.186 --> 00:16:21.486
Your turn, Shay.

00:16:21.486 --> 00:16:22.886
(Nico Smiley)
<i>What a performance!</i>

00:16:22.886 --> 00:16:26.020
These players are going at it
toe to toe, blow for blow!

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.453
As soon as Sora performs
a masterful maneuver,

00:16:28.453 --> 00:16:32.053
Shay turns the tables
to even things back up!

00:16:32.053 --> 00:16:33.453
That's what
you think...

00:16:33.453 --> 00:16:35.286
I don't think it's much
of a duel so far.

00:16:36.753 --> 00:16:39.353
I haven't even
broken a sweat yet.

00:16:39.353 --> 00:16:41.320
Shay's about as fierce
as this lollipop.

00:16:43.453 --> 00:16:46.086
And we've seen what
I can do to a lollipop!

00:16:46.086 --> 00:16:49.720
Though I'm guessing beating
you will taste a whole lot
sweeter.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.353
Losing wasn't
an option.

00:16:52.353 --> 00:16:55.186
Against an enemy
with overwhelming power...

00:16:55.186 --> 00:16:58.253
It took everything I had just to
defend myself and pull through.

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:02.386
(man)
What's up with
this guy?

00:17:02.386 --> 00:17:04.686
(woman)
What's he
talking about?

00:17:04.686 --> 00:17:07.420
But without an
organized resistance,

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.553
we struggled just
to hang on,

00:17:09.553 --> 00:17:12.086
even as our numbers
shrank and hope faded.

00:17:12.086 --> 00:17:14.553
<i>It was adesperate time.</i>

00:17:14.553 --> 00:17:17.286
But we learned
somethingimportant.

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:22.153
If we wanted tostay
free, we had to win.

00:17:22.153 --> 00:17:24.020
Only the ones who
held on,

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.386
the ones with an
absolute iron will to win

00:17:26.386 --> 00:17:28.820
had half a chance of making
it through to duel another day.

00:17:31.786 --> 00:17:33.986
You're about to get
a demonstration

00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:35.220
of what I'm
talking about,

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.686
of what it takes to win,

00:17:36.686 --> 00:17:38.553
because you Sora
are about to lose!

00:17:45.853 --> 00:17:48.553
Prepare yourself...

00:17:48.553 --> 00:17:50.620
Because the end
is coming!

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.553
I summon Raidraptor
Vanishing Lanius.

00:17:57.186 --> 00:18:00.120
But I'm not done yet,
not in the least...

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.620
On the turn this card
is successfully summoned,

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.620
I can summon another
Vanishing Lanius!

00:18:07.486 --> 00:18:10.320
Aw, man, now he's got a flock
of those things on his field.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.853
Oh, no.

00:18:11.853 --> 00:18:14.753
This is just
like last time.

00:18:14.753 --> 00:18:18.420
I overlay my three Laniuses
to build the Overlay Network!

00:18:24.153 --> 00:18:27.720
From the shadows, the falcon
soars on wings of courage,

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.386
talons ready
for the rebellion!

00:18:31.786 --> 00:18:33.586
I Xyz Summon!

00:18:33.586 --> 00:18:37.753
Witness the assent of
Raidraptor Rise Falcon!

00:18:43.653 --> 00:18:44.953
No doubt
about it.

00:18:44.953 --> 00:18:47.753
That's the same
monster as before!

00:18:47.753 --> 00:18:50.786
The one that took out
LID's top duelists!

00:18:50.786 --> 00:18:51.820
(Zuzu)
But how?

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:52.820
It could barley
beat a fly.

00:18:57.953 --> 00:19:00.386
This is what
you come up with?

00:19:00.386 --> 00:19:01.920
You can't be
serious.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.553
Deadly serious.

00:19:03.553 --> 00:19:06.653
Raidraptor Rise Falcon can
attack each of your monsters...

00:19:06.653 --> 00:19:09.120
I said the end was
coming and it's here!

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.753
You can attack
all my monsters

00:19:10.753 --> 00:19:12.553
and it won't make any
difference, Shay.

00:19:12.553 --> 00:19:14.686
It only has
100 attack points.

00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:17.253
That kid thinks he's got
it all figured out.

00:19:17.253 --> 00:19:19.653
He'll see how wrong
he is soon enough.

00:19:19.653 --> 00:19:22.320
Rise Falcon'll teach him a
lesson he'll never forget.

00:19:26.186 --> 00:19:27.920
Be careful, Sora!

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.986
It's dangerous!

00:19:29.986 --> 00:19:32.286
Yuya, don't worry,
I know what I'm doing!

00:19:33.953 --> 00:19:37.620
I activate Rise Falcon's
special ability!

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.786
By using one Overlay Unit,
it gains the attack points

00:19:40.786 --> 00:19:42.853
of every monster
on your field.

00:19:57.486 --> 00:19:59.986
That's a serious
amount of attack points!

00:19:59.986 --> 00:20:02.286
Sora's monsters are
about to get shredded!

00:20:02.286 --> 00:20:04.786
(gasping)

00:20:06.586 --> 00:20:08.953
Raidraptor Rise Falcon

00:20:08.953 --> 00:20:11.253
attack with
Ravaging Rebellion!

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.853
(gasping)

00:20:19.853 --> 00:20:21.920
That sheep didn't
hurt anyone!

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.053
(screaming)

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.953
(Yuya)
That monster's
too dangerous.

00:20:36.953 --> 00:20:38.720
It blew away those
LID students

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.253
and left real damage and now
Sora's gotta face it, head on.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.886
He's gotta be careful!

00:20:48.553 --> 00:20:50.553
(Nico Smiley)
<i>Incredible!</i>

00:20:50.553 --> 00:20:51.953
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

00:20:51.953 --> 00:20:54.353
Fluffal Sheep
and Frightfur Bear

00:20:54.353 --> 00:20:56.820
annihilated with a
single attack!

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:02.886
Will Sora be able to stand
up to this aerial onslaught?

00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:06.553
I place two cards
facedown and end my turn.

00:21:09.753 --> 00:21:13.120
Now my Rise Falcon's attack
points return to normal.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.186
But the way you're playing
that shouldn't make a
difference.

00:21:17.786 --> 00:21:20.186
Looks like you finally figured
out how to put on a show.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.886
But you better get ready
for some plot twists...

00:21:26.886 --> 00:21:29.753
and I'm sure you
won't like the ending!

00:21:31.553 --> 00:21:32.653
(laughing)

00:23:06.353 --> 00:23:09.853
