00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.833
I wish I knew what
happened that night.

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:17.400
When I spotted Yuya in the park,
he was in terrible shape.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.866
(gasping)
Yuya!

00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:23.500
I kept asking if he was okay,
but he wouldn't answer.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.633
And now it's been two days and
he still hasn't said anything,

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:28.833
and there's no sign
he's getting better.

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:31.600
If only there was something
I could do to help him.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.100
But I don't
even know what's wrong!

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.600
(sobbing)

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.266
Why did this happen to him!

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.300
What if he never wakes up again?

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.400
(Yoko)
Try to stay calm, Zuzu.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.066
Yuya's stronger than you think.

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.233
Imagine what it must have
been like for him

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:52.600
when his father disappeared.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.766
For a long time Yuya
retreated into himself.

00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.500
But inside Yuya, there was
a fierce competitor

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.466
waiting for the chance
to come out.

00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.800
Remember how it awakened when
he battled the Sledgehammer?

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.566
The same thing
will happen again soon.

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.833
Yuya! My sweetie pie!

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.866
What horrible fate
has befallen you!?

00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.500
Who is that girl!?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.100
(Zuzu)
Her name is Aura.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.100
I will save you!

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:20.966
Yuya!

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.400
I won't let you leave me! No!

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.700
I'll cure you of this
mysterious malady!

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.100
I shall unleash my
magical powers

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.433
to bring you back from
the brink of oblivion!

00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:34.666

problems are solved.

(Aura)
My magical makeover
of your room

00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:41.333
will help repel any malevolent
spirits.

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:44.666
I'm also placing these enchanted
Regeneration Crystals around you

00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:47.066
to draw positive
energy to your body.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:48.300
In no time at all,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.100
I'll have you back on your feet
and at my side.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.033
(humming)

00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:01.766
Aura, no.

00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:03.366
What do you think
you're doing?

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:05.833
Trying to save my sweetheart,
of course.

00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:07.500
But that will
never be possible

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.100
as long as he's wearing those
sinister jammies.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.433
Don't you realize gray
is the most negative color
in the universe?

00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:16.333
His current clothing will ward
off any healing spells I cast.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.666
Change him into green or white
PJs now!

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:22.133
Green or white?
But why?

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:25.800
(Aura)
Everyone knows green is the
color of life and growth,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.566
while white radiates healing
purity.

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:31.300
If Yuya isn't decked out in
green and white on the double,

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.733
you'll have me seeing red.

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:34.700
Now bust a move!

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.500
(laughing)

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.366
Ah, that's much better.

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:41.200
(Yoko)
Pardon my curiosity, Aura,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.566
but how did you learn
that Yuya was unconscious?

00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:45.500
(Zuzu)
Did you use your
psychic powers?

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.633
Of course.

00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:48.600
Plus, I might have
overheard something.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.200
I was at the arena
and some of the kids

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.200
from your school were there,
too, talking about Yuya.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.666
When I found out about
his condition,

00:03:54.666 --> 00:03:58.300
I decided to drop what I was
doing and rush right over here.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.966
Thank goodness,
I came when I did.

00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:04.400
You two mean well,
but your TLC is MIA.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.266
(gasping)
Wait a minute.

00:04:07.266 --> 00:04:10.733
Aura, shouldn't you be...
having a duel just about now?

00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:13.000
In the Junior Arc League
Championship?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.600
Eh, who cares?

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.666
The fate of my beloved is much
more important

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:18.633
than who wins some trivial
championship.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.066
(both)
You're wrong, Aura!

00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:25.666
Huh?

00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:27.466
(Zuzu)
Yuya is devoted to dueling.

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:30.033
If he senses that you forfeited
a duel to come here,

00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:31.433
it could make him even worse.

00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:33.766
The best care in the world
won't be enough to wake him.

00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:37.000
What Yuya needs most
is for you to win.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.200
Your magic may be powerful,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.733
but it's no match for the
healing power of...

00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:44.133
(both)
One victory!

00:04:45.466 --> 00:04:47.566
You wanna save Yuya?

00:04:47.566 --> 00:04:48.933
Then go and win that duel.

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:52.433
And if I do,
he'll get better?

00:04:52.433 --> 00:04:53.866
That's right.

00:04:53.866 --> 00:04:57.000
But you have to hurry
or you'll miss it.

00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:01.366
I will go.

00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:06.033
And overwhelm my foe,
like a tsunami!

00:05:06.033 --> 00:05:07.700
(sighing)
(sighing)

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.933
(Nico Smiley)
We apologize for the delay in
today's first duel.

00:05:16.933 --> 00:05:19.833
As you know, Moon Shadow from
the Fuuma Clan Duel School

00:05:19.833 --> 00:05:22.733
is scheduled to take on Aura
Sentia from Fortune Prep,

00:05:22.733 --> 00:05:25.533
but so far she's no‐show.

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:28.733
Could this be the first
forfeiture of our tournament?

00:05:28.733 --> 00:05:30.733
If Aura doesn't appear soon,

00:05:30.733 --> 00:05:33.600
Moon Shadow will score a win
by default.

00:05:36.033 --> 00:05:38.400
He won't get off the hook
that easily.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.000
Up here!

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.266
Hello! It's our missing missy.

00:05:45.266 --> 00:05:47.433
Aura made it in
the nick of time.

00:05:47.433 --> 00:05:51.133
And it looks like she's packing
some serious baditude.

00:05:51.133 --> 00:05:52.766
Two minutes.

00:05:52.766 --> 00:05:54.066
That's how long it will be

00:05:54.066 --> 00:05:56.233
before you're begging me to
accept your surrender.

00:05:56.233 --> 00:05:58.833
But I won't back down till
you've been eliminated.

00:05:58.833 --> 00:06:02.666
Only one outcome will satisfy me
today: complete victory.

00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:04.500
(Nico Smiley)
Aura hasn't drawn her first card

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.166
and she's already taking
the offensive.

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:08.933
My win will then instantly
revive Yuya.

00:06:08.933 --> 00:06:11.533
Thank you Aura, my fairest.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.866
Huh?

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.066
Yuya.

00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:27.300
Zuzu? Mom?

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.266
I was out cold for
two whole days?

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:32.733
Yes, we couldn't wake you.

00:06:32.733 --> 00:06:35.033
You must have been
exhausted, son.

00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:37.300
After all, you were
dueling non‐stop

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.033
for weeks
with hardly any rest

00:06:39.033 --> 00:06:41.466
and it must have been
too much for your
mind and body.

00:06:41.466 --> 00:06:42.933
You needed sleep.

00:06:42.933 --> 00:06:44.833
Yeah, but I missed part of
the tournament.

00:06:44.833 --> 00:06:46.233
What's going on?

00:06:46.233 --> 00:06:49.566
Well, the first round of the
Junior Division is almost done.

00:06:49.566 --> 00:06:50.933
Aura's dueling now.

00:06:50.933 --> 00:06:53.433
I think they just got started,
so we can check it out.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.100
Huh?

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.500
Why aren't they showing
her duel?

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.733
It's over?

00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:03.466
(Zuzu)
I can't believe it.

00:07:03.466 --> 00:07:05.033
It ended on the first turn.

00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:07.266
Aura has been eliminated.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.933
No!

00:07:16.266 --> 00:07:18.433
This championship
is intense.

00:07:18.433 --> 00:07:21.800
I knew we'd face great duelists,
but these guys are exceptional.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.033
Whoever wins it all will really
be the best of the best.

00:07:26.033 --> 00:07:29.133
Even some of the younger
duelists are incredible.

00:07:29.133 --> 00:07:30.866
Yesterday, Frederick had his
deck handed to him

00:07:30.866 --> 00:07:33.733
by that strange kid
from Leo, Riley.

00:07:33.733 --> 00:07:35.933
Isn't Riley the one
who defeated Allie?

00:07:35.933 --> 00:07:37.400
Yeah.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.966
Riley Fusion Summoned
to take her down.

00:07:39.966 --> 00:07:43.100
But this time,
this time was different.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.700
I Synchro Summon.

00:07:48.466 --> 00:07:50.533
Aah!

00:07:50.533 --> 00:07:53.600
I feel like
a deflated zeppelin.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.866
Riley Synchro Summoned?

00:08:00.866 --> 00:08:03.000
Yeah, amazing right?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.733
Riley is still in
the Youth Division

00:08:04.733 --> 00:08:07.800
but can Fusion
and Synchro Summon.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.100
Add in an Xyz Summon,
and that kid'll be like

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.833
a pint‐sized version
of Declan Akaba.

00:08:13.833 --> 00:08:18.233
Fusion... Synchro... and Xyz.

00:08:18.233 --> 00:08:20.566
You sound worried.

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:23.433
Well, before,
when I was dueling Yuto,

00:08:23.433 --> 00:08:26.066
he told me something strange.

00:08:26.066 --> 00:08:29.133
That our world has been divided
into four different dimensions.

00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:31.100
Different dimensions?

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.866
(Yuya)
According to Yuto, there's a
Fusion dimension,

00:08:33.866 --> 00:08:36.700
a Synchro dimension,
and an Xyz dimension.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.833
They exist parallel to the
Standard dimension we live in.

00:08:39.833 --> 00:08:41.966
Sora's from the Fusion
dimension,

00:08:41.966 --> 00:08:44.766
while Yuto and Shay come from
the Xyz dimension.

00:08:44.766 --> 00:08:47.566
Yuto said their two dimensions
are enemies.

00:08:47.566 --> 00:08:52.566
Sora was dueling Yuto,
but then he vanished.

00:08:52.566 --> 00:08:53.766
Vanished?

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:56.900
Yeah, Yuto believes Sora
was transported

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.733
back to the Fusion
dimension.

00:08:58.733 --> 00:09:01.400
You mean Sora isn't
in our world anymore?

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.666
Exactly.

00:09:02.666 --> 00:09:05.266
And after he disappeared,
Yugo showed up.

00:09:05.266 --> 00:09:06.933
Huh? Who is Yugo?

00:09:06.933 --> 00:09:10.533
He's another interdimensional
guy, and he looks like me, too.

00:09:10.533 --> 00:09:13.933
Yugo rode in on this machine
kind of like a motorcycle.

00:09:13.933 --> 00:09:15.266
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.833
(Yuya)
From what I could tell,

00:09:18.833 --> 00:09:22.233
he's a duelist who comes from
the Synchro dimension.

00:09:22.233 --> 00:09:23.766
I don't get it.

00:09:23.766 --> 00:09:26.566
All this dimensional stuff
sounds so complicated.

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.033
I thought Yuto was fighting

00:09:28.033 --> 00:09:30.500
to rescue Lulu from
a Fusion Summoner.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.966
Maybe that was Yugo.

00:09:32.966 --> 00:09:34.766
Huh?

00:09:34.766 --> 00:09:37.100
Yuto called him
a fusion follower

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.666
even though he's from the
Synchro dimension.

00:09:39.666 --> 00:09:42.633
It seemed like the two of them
had dueled before.

00:09:42.633 --> 00:09:44.700
They couldn't stand
each other.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.266
You're the ones
who stole from me!

00:09:47.266 --> 00:09:48.533
Enough!

00:09:48.533 --> 00:09:50.833
We can talk about
who stole what after the duel.

00:09:50.833 --> 00:09:52.733
That is if you still can talk.

00:09:52.733 --> 00:09:55.400
I Synchro Summon.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.566
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:03.800
I Xyz Summon!

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.133
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:10:10.233 --> 00:10:12.633
(roaring)

00:10:12.633 --> 00:10:14.800
(roaring)

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.200
Isn't that...

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.366
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon.

00:10:31.366 --> 00:10:33.933
But what are you doing with one
of Yuto's cards?

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:36.966
He gave it to me,

00:10:36.966 --> 00:10:39.566
right after he
saved my life.

00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:44.100
(Yugo)
Spin Storm Sky Strike!

00:10:51.466 --> 00:10:54.900
Yuto, wake up, it's over.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.633
This is yours,
take it, Yuya.

00:11:02.633 --> 00:11:07.266
Always remember,
use your power

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:11.066
to keep the world
entertained and smiling.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.533
I will... for you.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.966
I'm not sure what happened
to him after that.

00:11:23.966 --> 00:11:27.400
Next thing I knew,
I woke up here.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.700
It's strange.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.000
When Yuto handed
this card to me,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.600
he said that I should
use my dueling

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.800
to keep the world happy
and entertained.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.433
I wonder if this card's gonna
help me do that.

00:11:46.433 --> 00:11:48.433
It seems so unreal.

00:11:48.433 --> 00:11:52.633
First I met Yuto,
and then Yugo turned up, too.

00:11:52.633 --> 00:11:54.466
We're from
different dimensions,

00:11:54.466 --> 00:11:56.733
but we all look
exactly the same.

00:11:56.733 --> 00:11:58.700
It feels like...

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.266
like some kind
of cosmic joke.

00:12:01.266 --> 00:12:04.900
I thought I was
one of a kind,
but I'm not.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.766
You're not the only one.

00:12:07.766 --> 00:12:10.866
There's also someone
who looks just like me.

00:12:10.866 --> 00:12:13.066
Huh?

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.900
Listen, you guys, you have to
transport me

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.800
back to the Standard dimension
right away.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.000
Don't you realize there are
fugitives hiding there

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.100
who escaped from the
Xyz dimension.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.533
I know where they are, and I can
go back and capture them

00:12:31.533 --> 00:12:33.166
if you just give me another
chance.

00:12:33.166 --> 00:12:35.733
I can take all of them on, and
I'll defeat them, I know it.

00:12:35.733 --> 00:12:38.433
Please, let me finish
what I started!

00:12:38.433 --> 00:12:39.833
Hold up!

00:12:39.833 --> 00:12:42.466
So you're saying that you
have a double as well?

00:12:42.466 --> 00:12:43.800
Mm‐hmm.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.566
When Yuto first saw me,
he thought I was her.

00:12:46.566 --> 00:12:49.600
And when Shay saw me, he called
me by the name Lulu.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.500
I wonder what
all this means.

00:12:55.333 --> 00:12:57.000
Let's go find Shay.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.433
I bet he knows more.

00:12:58.433 --> 00:12:59.766
Huh?

00:12:59.766 --> 00:13:02.500
With Yuto and Sora
out of the picture,

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.733
Shay is the only hope
we have right now

00:13:04.733 --> 00:13:07.000
of discovering the answers
we're looking for.

00:13:08.433 --> 00:13:10.433
Mm‐hmm.

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:14.933
Mom, I gotta dash out
for awhile.

00:13:14.933 --> 00:13:16.533
You're leaving without
having breakfast?

00:13:16.533 --> 00:13:18.933
Mm‐hmm. I'll eat lunch twice
to make up for it.

00:13:18.933 --> 00:13:20.566
Wait, where are you going?

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:22.933
(Yuya)
To the Championship.

00:13:22.933 --> 00:13:25.800
That boy of mine is growing up
to become more and more

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.766
like someone else I know.

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:32.700
But I guess that's inevitable,
isn't it, Yusho?

00:13:39.633 --> 00:13:42.766
Next, I'll take my Constellar
Algiedi and my Kaus,

00:13:42.766 --> 00:13:45.833
and I'll overlay them.

00:13:45.833 --> 00:13:50.133
The light of distant stars
shatters the dark of night.

00:13:50.133 --> 00:13:55.000
I Xyz Summon
Constellar Pleiades!

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.800
But I'm not finished,

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.166
because I'm also overlaying
Pollux and Siat.

00:14:02.166 --> 00:14:04.000
I Xyz Summon.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.466
Arise and unleash your celestial
fury, Constellar Ptolemy M7!

00:14:13.366 --> 00:14:15.600
(crowd cheering)

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.333
Yeah, Dipper's doin' dynamite.

00:14:18.333 --> 00:14:20.466
What else would you expect
from a Leo duelist?

00:14:26.233 --> 00:14:28.866
(Tate)
Pick up the pace, you guys.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.566
Huh? Zuzu?

00:14:35.566 --> 00:14:38.600
(Tate)
Hey, Allie, we have to get
moving, come on!

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.966
<i>Ja, mach schnell!</i>

00:14:39.966 --> 00:14:43.066
But, guys, I just saw
Zuzu over there.

00:14:43.066 --> 00:14:45.633
Huh? Well, she was
right there.

00:14:45.633 --> 00:14:46.966
Where'd she go?

00:14:46.966 --> 00:14:48.366
Zuzu can't be here.

00:14:48.366 --> 00:14:51.566
She called to say she's at
the arena with Yuya.

00:14:51.566 --> 00:14:54.400
Get your glockenspiel in gear
or you'll be left behind.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.433
Wait for me!

00:14:57.433 --> 00:15:00.066
Yuya! Buddy!

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.200
Gong's as euphoric right now

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.700
as a pack o' grizzlies
in a honey factory.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.400
You had us all
scared silly we'd never
see you awake again.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.200
I just needed
to catch some Z's.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.800
You were passed out
so long,

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.566
you must've caught
the whole alphabet.

00:15:14.566 --> 00:15:16.300
I'm just glad you
rolled out of bed

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.200
before the second round
gets underway.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.166
(Allie)
Hey, Yuya, over here!

00:15:24.766 --> 00:15:26.666
Glad to see you're okay.

00:15:26.666 --> 00:15:28.700
You Show has its
duelmeister back.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.200
Once we find Sora,
we'll be all together.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.666
He'll probably be turning up
any minute now.

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:35.633
(Gong)
Maybe so,

00:15:35.633 --> 00:15:37.700
but we shouldn't start
celebratin' till he's back.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.633
We searched high and low,

00:15:39.633 --> 00:15:41.800
but so far we haven't found
any sign of Sora.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.900
He's bound to turn up
sooner or later.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.533
(Aura)
Yuya, my sweet.

00:15:45.533 --> 00:15:46.533
(all)
Hmm?

00:15:46.533 --> 00:15:48.533
My Duelmate has awakened.

00:15:48.533 --> 00:15:50.000
Duelmate?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.500
I just knew my magic would
revive you.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.866
Now I only have to complete your
cure with a kiss.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.033
Uhh!

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Yuya Sakaki.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.133
Did you happen to catch
my last duel?

00:16:12.133 --> 00:16:13.900
I bet you were impressed
by the way I summoned

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.433
two Xyz Monsters in a row,
weren't you?

00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:17.933
Of course,
if we face off, I'll‐‐

00:16:17.933 --> 00:16:20.033
Zip it, Dipper.

00:16:20.033 --> 00:16:21.533
I wanna talk to Shay.

00:16:21.533 --> 00:16:23.066
Oh, yeah? About what?

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:26.266
(Zuzu)
It's for his ears only,
Julia.

00:16:26.266 --> 00:16:27.700
(Julia)
Zuzu...

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.633
Tell him this is important.

00:16:29.633 --> 00:16:31.866
It concerns the both of us.

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:33.233
(Kit)
Forget it.
Huh?

00:16:33.233 --> 00:16:34.600
Don't waste your time,

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.533
'cause Shay will never
agree to meet with you.

00:16:36.533 --> 00:16:39.533
He barely speaks to us
and we're supposed
to be teammates.

00:16:39.533 --> 00:16:43.266
(Shay)
I demand to see Declan
immediately.

00:16:43.266 --> 00:16:45.366
Step aside, this is urgent.

00:16:45.366 --> 00:16:47.766
I'm afraid the President's
schedule is completely
full today.

00:16:47.766 --> 00:16:50.666
He'll make time for me when
he learns why I've come.

00:16:50.666 --> 00:16:53.100
I haven't been able to make
contact with Yuto.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.600
Is that so?

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.533
I'll let the President know.

00:16:56.533 --> 00:16:58.633
Perhaps we can schedule
a meeting next week

00:16:58.633 --> 00:17:00.300
for you to discuss
the matter with him.

00:17:03.233 --> 00:17:05.433
Well, I got a duel to win.

00:17:05.433 --> 00:17:07.200
You losers should check it out.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.300
I'm up against Iggy Arlo.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.333
Pay close attention,
you may learn something.

00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:16.566
(Nico Smiley)
The first round of our Junior
Division competition

00:17:16.566 --> 00:17:19.333
is rushing to a breathtaking
conclusion.

00:17:19.333 --> 00:17:22.300
So far, 31 duelists have made
the cut for round two.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.833
Kit Blade of the Leo Institute

00:17:23.833 --> 00:17:25.600
will now battle for the final
spot against

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.000
the Banded Warrior Academy's
star student, Iggy Arlo.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.466
Which of these two fierce
warriors

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:34.366
will seize the day and continue
the hunt for glory?

00:17:34.366 --> 00:17:35.766
I don't have the answer,

00:17:35.766 --> 00:17:38.800
but I can tell you this will be
one bruiser of a battle.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.433
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:17:40.433 --> 00:17:43.100
(shouting)

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:47.733
(gasping)
Wait, what's going on?!

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:50.633
(Iggy)
How do you like this monster?

00:17:50.633 --> 00:17:52.533
And here's one of
my favorite traps.

00:17:52.533 --> 00:17:53.833
Low blow!

00:17:55.166 --> 00:17:58.100
(Iggy)
Try these attacks on for size.

00:17:59.833 --> 00:18:03.800
Looks like you're out of life
points, but I better make sure.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.300
Uhh!

00:18:15.233 --> 00:18:16.933
That was no duel.

00:18:16.933 --> 00:18:19.366
It was more like
a free‐for‐all.

00:18:19.366 --> 00:18:21.300
You guys, this is a duel.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.000
It isn't a war.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.600
Always remember,
use your power

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.400
to keep the world
entertained and smiling.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.133
Uuhhhh!

00:18:34.133 --> 00:18:37.066
Yuya?

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.700
(Nico Smiley)
And with that, we lower the
curtain on the first round

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.100
of the Junior Arc League
Championship.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.200
Those advancing to round two
may now access the official

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.466
tournament datastream to learn
their next matchups.

00:18:54.933 --> 00:18:57.400
Looks like Gong's got
the first duel tomorrow.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.533
Gong's facing Trick Taggart
from the Abracadabra Academy.

00:19:00.533 --> 00:19:03.066
And I'm battling that
pop star Micky Starlet

00:19:03.066 --> 00:19:05.466
from the Dueling Dynamo
Duel School.

00:19:05.466 --> 00:19:08.300
Who will you duel, Yuya?

00:19:11.666 --> 00:19:14.066
(Tate)
Iggy Arlo?!

00:19:14.066 --> 00:19:15.766
Oh, no.

00:19:15.766 --> 00:19:16.800
For real?

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.133
Mm‐hmm.

00:19:18.133 --> 00:19:22.300
Yuto told me to use my dueling
to make people happy.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.200
I don't see how that's
gonna help me defeat
someone like Iggy.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.766
But if anyone can pull it off,
it's me.

00:19:28.766 --> 00:19:32.600
After all, I am the son of the
world's greatest dueltainer.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.700
(Yuya, thinking)
Iggy, our styles of dueling
are totally different.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.566
Your way causes pain and shame,
but I duel to make fans smile.

00:19:48.566 --> 00:19:50.033
Before our match is thru,

00:19:50.033 --> 00:19:52.133
I'll prove that no matter
how rough you play,

00:19:52.133 --> 00:19:56.000
there's no way your gonna take
the spotlight away from me.

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:09.433
