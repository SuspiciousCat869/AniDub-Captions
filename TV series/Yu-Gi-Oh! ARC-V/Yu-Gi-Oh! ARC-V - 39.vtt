(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V."

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:08.266
(Yuya)
When I was dueling Yuto,
he told me something strange.

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:11.300
That our world has been divided
into four different dimensions.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.533
There's a Fusion dimension,
a Synchro dimension,

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.133
and an Xyz dimension.

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:19.166
They exist parallel to the
Standard dimension we live in.

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:22.666
Yuto believes Sora was
transported back to
the Fusion dimension.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.966
(Zuzu)
Isn't that...

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.833
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon.

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:31.266
But what are you doing
with one of Yuto's cards?

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:35.533
He gave it to me, right after
he saved my life.

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.266
It seems so unreal.

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:41.300
First I met Yuto,
and then Yugo turned up, too!

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.100
We're from
different dimensions,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.400
but we all look
exactly the same!

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.500
There's also someone
who looks just like me.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.666
Huh?

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.300
When Yuto first saw me,
he thought I was her.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.866
And when Shay saw me,
he called me by the name Lulu.

00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.533
(Allie)
Zuzu?

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.600
(Tate)
We have to get moving!
Come on!

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.733
But guys,
I just saw Zuzu over there.

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.000
Zuzu can't be here!

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.833
She called to say she's
at the arena with Yuya!

00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:12.700
Gong's facing Trick Taggart
from the Abracadabra Academy.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.100
Who will you duel, Yuya?

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.300
(Tate)
Iggy Arlo!?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.433
(thinking)
Iggy, our styles of dueling
are totally different!

00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:24.566
Your way causes pain and shame,
but I duel to make fans smile!

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.566
I'll prove that no matter how
rough you play,

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.966
there's no way your gonna take
the spotlight away from me!

(Nico Smiley)
Oh, my! Gong has been duped
into being blindfolded

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:38.266
by the trickster,
Trick Taggert!

00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:40.266
This isn't gonna save you.

00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:42.766
Tricks like this
can't fool Gong.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.566
Go get him, Susanowo.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.766
My trick tanked!

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.733
That was too easy.

00:02:57.733 --> 00:03:00.433
(Nico Smiley)
As fast as you can say
"Abracadabra,"

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:02.066
<i>this duel is done!</i>

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:04.266
So, in the first match
of the second round,

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:07.733
Gong Strong of Paradise
City's prestigious Duel Dojo

00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:10.733
defeated Abracadabra
Academy'sTrick Taggart!

00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:12.266
That's one.

00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:14.366
And Yuya's gonna make it
two for two.

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:15.800
<i>Ja.</i>

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.900
Now striding confidently into
the stadium

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.266
for the second match
of the day,

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:24.933
You Show Duel School's
own Yuya Sakaki!

00:03:24.933 --> 00:03:26.933
(girl)
Go get him, Yuya baby!
(man)
We want Yuya!

00:03:26.933 --> 00:03:28.666
Thank you, guys!

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:29.833
Hey, thank you!

00:03:32.633 --> 00:03:33.866
Hey, what's wrong?

00:03:33.866 --> 00:03:36.366
You kids look more worried
than Yuya does.

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:40.133
We're all nervous because Yuya's
going up against Iggy Arlo.

00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:42.566
You saw Iggy's match yesterday,
didn't you?

00:03:42.566 --> 00:03:45.566
It gave me bad
goose pickles.

00:03:45.566 --> 00:03:49.300
(Tate)
He totally clobbered Kit in,
like, a nano‐second!

00:03:50.966 --> 00:03:52.533
Uhh!

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:54.633
Iggy was runner‐up last year,

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:56.500
and this year he looks
even tougher

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.666
(Gong)
Ya got that right.

00:03:57.666 --> 00:04:00.000
Gong heard he's been trainin'
night and day for this.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.800
So, everybody including Iggy
himself knows

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.000
he's the odds‐on favorite to
finish number one this year.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.433
And now, Banded
Warrior Academy's Iggy Arlo!

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:11.766
(crash)

00:04:11.766 --> 00:04:15.300
(crashing continues)

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.033
He's scary just to look at.

00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:30.433
You won't see
this guy smiling.

00:04:30.433 --> 00:04:33.766
The Banded Warrior martial
duelists are dead serious.

00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:35.600
Why's that?

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.633
They all want to win, and that's
all they care about.

00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:41.533
You've seen how they duel,
anything goes.

00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:45.066
Full force, no‐holds barred,
take no prisoners.

00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:48.100
Ryozan Godagawa, the Banded
Warrior Academy's headmaster,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.600
gets criticized for the brutal
way he trains his students.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.266
Waaah!

00:04:54.266 --> 00:04:57.800
(Skip Boyle)
But his students pile up
trophy after trophy.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.300
There's no denying
his success.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.266
(Tate)
He sounds... strict.

00:05:02.266 --> 00:05:04.866
(Skip Boyle)
Ha! Strict's not the word!

00:05:04.866 --> 00:05:06.533
His school's a boarding
school.

00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:09.233
The students aren't even allowed
to go outside.

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:10.933
All they do is train.

00:05:10.933 --> 00:05:13.600
They can't even see their
parents until they turn pro.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.333
(Frederick) Ach du lieber!
I would run away!

00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:19.266
(Skip Boyle)
Maybe you would,
but there's a waiting list

00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:21.033
a mile long to get in.

00:05:21.033 --> 00:05:24.033
The Banded Warrior Academy turns
out the second highest number

00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:27.400
of pros in the business,
just behind Leo Institute.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.133
(Gong)
And the toughest student
that school

00:05:29.133 --> 00:05:32.933
ever turned out
is Iggy Arlo.

00:05:34.866 --> 00:05:36.600
(Nico Smiley)
Now that you've met our
duelists,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.933
it's time to learn where
they'll be dueling.

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:45.433
And it looks like they'll
be battling it out

00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:48.366
in the Bamboo
Battleground!

00:05:48.366 --> 00:05:51.433
(Computer Voice)Augmented
Reality Combat System energized.

00:05:51.433 --> 00:05:54.100
<i>Generating Action Field.</i>

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.766
Iggy, I saw your
duel yesterday.

00:06:12.433 --> 00:06:13.833
Hyah!

00:06:16.833 --> 00:06:19.733
But it was more like
a demolition derby,

00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:21.433
and you were in the driver's
seat.

00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:26.366
You're mistaking me for someone
who cares what you think.

00:06:28.633 --> 00:06:29.900
Fine, be that way!

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.500
I'll show you what I think
of you and your school!

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.166
Good, and I'll enjoy
seeing you fail.

00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:38.200
Here we go!

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.900
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:43.800
<i>Here we go!</i>

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.600
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

(Computer Voice)
<i>Action Cards dispersed.</i>

00:06:49.866 --> 00:06:52.600
Hmph.
(chuckling)

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.933
All right, first up,
I'll get this party started

00:06:55.933 --> 00:06:59.966
with my always entertaining
Performapal Silver Claw.

00:07:04.066 --> 00:07:05.833
(spectator)
All right, Yuya!

00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:07.233
(man)
Stick it to him, Yuya!

00:07:07.233 --> 00:07:08.966
Aw.
Ha ha ha!

00:07:08.966 --> 00:07:10.366
Watch where you are going!

00:07:10.366 --> 00:07:11.366
Look out!

00:07:11.366 --> 00:07:12.733
Huh?

00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:14.233
Aah!

00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:16.666
Aah!

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.666
He's eating bamboo leaves
like a panda bear!

00:07:26.933 --> 00:07:29.566
I end my turn.
Make your move.

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:31.533
I will.

00:07:31.533 --> 00:07:34.366
When I'm through
punishing you,

00:07:34.366 --> 00:07:36.266
you'll wish you never
picked up a deck.

00:07:36.266 --> 00:07:39.033
I summon the relentless and
ruthless warrior

00:07:39.033 --> 00:07:40.666
Hayate, The Earth Star.

00:07:44.866 --> 00:07:47.533
(Nico Smiley)Uh‐oh, Yuya's in
trouble 'cause that monster's

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:51.433
got more attack points then
a Kuriboh's got hair!

00:07:51.433 --> 00:07:55.233
Hayate, hunt down his
Silver Claw, now.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.300
(roaring)

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.166
All right, action time!

00:08:14.866 --> 00:08:16.233
Close call.

00:08:16.233 --> 00:08:17.266
(Iggy)
True.

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:21.833
But only because
I chose to miss.

00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:24.000
Next time,
you won't be so lucky.

00:08:25.466 --> 00:08:28.766
Hayate, waste the wolf!

00:08:28.766 --> 00:08:31.133
Aah!

00:08:31.133 --> 00:08:33.800
(Nico Smiley) And Yuya
takes his first hit!

00:08:35.266 --> 00:08:36.966
It's not a total loss.

00:08:36.966 --> 00:08:38.966
My Silver Claw goes straight
to my extra deck.

00:08:38.966 --> 00:08:41.166
It doesn't matter!

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:42.366
Not cool.

00:08:42.366 --> 00:08:44.800
He blocked Yuya
from getting that card!

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.700
Yuya got bamboozled.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.500
On your feet. Let's see
what you're made of.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:56.233
Tripping me up really
tripped me up for a sec.

00:08:56.233 --> 00:08:58.100
But I got this.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.500
I'll be ready
for everything you've got.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.300
Starting now!

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.900
Nice.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.033
I'll use Scale 4 Performapal
Trump Witch

00:09:07.033 --> 00:09:11.100
and Scale 8 Timegazer Magician
to set the Pendulum Scale.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.266
I'm taking control of
this duel starting now!

00:09:21.966 --> 00:09:24.933
I can summon monsters from
Level 5 through Level 7

00:09:24.933 --> 00:09:26.966
all at the same time!

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:28.733
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:09:28.733 --> 00:09:32.233
Carve the arc of victory!

00:09:32.233 --> 00:09:37.133
My monster's ready to
swing into action!

00:09:37.133 --> 00:09:41.200
Turn up the heat, Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.933
(Nico Smiley)
Sakaki's just summoned
his main monster!

00:09:43.933 --> 00:09:46.666
And now is when
the fun starts.

00:09:46.666 --> 00:09:48.500
(cheering)

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.900
This'll be so great!

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.433
Yuya!

00:09:51.433 --> 00:09:53.900
A duel that's fun?

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.633
Yeah, fun's what
dueling's all about.

00:09:56.633 --> 00:09:59.400
The only reason
to duel is to win.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.666
I guess we can agree
to disagree,

00:10:01.666 --> 00:10:03.900
but I want to win
just as much as you!

00:10:05.966 --> 00:10:07.500
What have we got?

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.466
Okay, let's keep the party going
with Performapal Camelump!

00:10:15.366 --> 00:10:18.000
All right, Odd‐Eyes Pendulum
Dragon

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.833
attack Hayate, The Earth Star!

00:10:20.833 --> 00:10:23.600
(roaring)

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.233
How pathetic, Yuya.

00:10:26.233 --> 00:10:28.800
When Hayate's the only
monster on my field,

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.433
its special ability
blocks your attack.

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:36.633
Odd‐Eyes was blindsided
by that move!

00:10:36.633 --> 00:10:39.100
Well, you're not out
of the woods,

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.566
or should I say bamboo
forest, yet!

00:10:43.566 --> 00:10:47.000
Is Yuya gonna do what I think
he's going to do?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.166
Yeah, he's got his
Trump Witch all ready
to swing into action!

00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:53.033
I'm hoping she doesn't
fall short.

00:10:53.033 --> 00:10:57.233
I activate Performapal Trump
Witch's Pendulum ability!

00:10:57.233 --> 00:11:02.400
She lets me fuse my monsters
together without using
Polymerization.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.400
I'll fuse Performapal Camelump
and Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon.

00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:15.233
Now by fusing
the thirst‐quenching drive
of one monster

00:11:15.233 --> 00:11:17.633
with the ferocity of another,

00:11:17.633 --> 00:11:20.233
I Fusion Summon...

00:11:20.233 --> 00:11:23.500
Beast‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.366
(roaring)

00:11:28.366 --> 00:11:29.966
(Nico Smiley)
<i>Yuya's done it again!</i>

00:11:29.966 --> 00:11:33.133
He's brought a beastly new
mega‐monster center stage!

00:11:33.133 --> 00:11:35.866
And while this beast shines
in the spotlight, his trusty

00:11:35.866 --> 00:11:39.933
Camelump and Odd‐Eyes rest
backstage in his extra deck.

00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:42.133
Yuya never ceases
to surprise!

00:11:42.133 --> 00:11:45.000
He keeps bringing the fun
under the sun!

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.500
(Ryozan Godagawa)
Walk with purpose.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.966
Your journey will only
waver if you do.

00:11:48.966 --> 00:11:52.000
(Young Iggy)
Sorry, master.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.066
(Ryozan)
Apologies are a sign of
weakness.

00:11:55.066 --> 00:11:58.033
(Young Yuya)
Okay, Dad, you ready for me to
take center stage?!

00:11:58.033 --> 00:11:59.800
(Yusho)
Ready Yuya, go for it.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.033
Just remember to sprinkle on
some surprise

00:12:02.033 --> 00:12:03.333
to make things dueltaining!

00:12:03.333 --> 00:12:05.833
I know, and don't
forget to add in the fun!

00:12:05.833 --> 00:12:07.566
(Yusho)
That's the spirit!

00:12:07.566 --> 00:12:09.533
(Ryozan)
Look at those two fools.

00:12:09.533 --> 00:12:10.933
They will amount to nothing.

00:12:10.933 --> 00:12:13.766
Dueling is about winning,
not having fun.

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:17.300
The path you will travel
will lead you from such
childish thoughts.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.366
Your parents know
that the Duel Disk
they gave you is not a toy.

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.433
It is a means to an end.

00:12:23.433 --> 00:12:25.500
Follow the way
of the warrior.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:30.233
Only when you become one will
you see your parents once more.

00:12:30.233 --> 00:12:33.333
We each took different paths
to get to this point.

00:12:33.333 --> 00:12:36.433
Now the time has come to see
which path leads to victory

00:12:36.433 --> 00:12:38.633
and which leads to defeat
and despair.

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:42.400
The only thing your way
leads to is a dead‐end.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.100
We shall see.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.000
Hmm.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.500
Showtime!

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.533
Beast‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon,
attack Hayate, The Earth Star!

00:12:51.533 --> 00:12:53.900
(roaring)

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.433
I activate
the Action Spell Evasion!

00:12:57.433 --> 00:13:00.600
It lets my monster dodge
your Dragon's attack.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.133
(Nico Smiley)
My, my, this Iggy seems
to always

00:13:03.133 --> 00:13:05.366
be one step ahead of
Yuya!

00:13:05.366 --> 00:13:09.133
You see dueling as a way
to entertain, to have fun.

00:13:09.133 --> 00:13:12.000
Now I will show you
the fun in losing.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.633
Enjoy these last moments
of this duel.

00:13:14.633 --> 00:13:16.233
Because when I'm through
with you,

00:13:16.233 --> 00:13:20.100
you'll never duel again.

00:13:28.133 --> 00:13:30.666
Enjoy these last moments
of this duel.

00:13:30.666 --> 00:13:33.500
Don't you mean
the last moments of my turn?

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.500
This duel's far from over!

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.333
I draw!

00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:39.766
Prepare for total destruction,
Yuya.

00:13:39.766 --> 00:13:43.966
I summon Tenma, The Sky Star!

00:13:43.966 --> 00:13:46.700
(growls)

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.633
And now I'll fuse these two
warriors with the help
of Polymerization.

00:13:50.633 --> 00:13:53.600
What?!
You're going to get pounded.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.533
I'll strike hard.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.666
And bring you down fast.

00:13:59.666 --> 00:14:02.733
Never to rise again!

00:14:05.633 --> 00:14:11.000
I Fusion Summon
Idaten, The Conqueror Star!

00:14:13.933 --> 00:14:17.133
(Nico Smiley)
A major Fusion Summon
from Iggy Arlo!

00:14:17.133 --> 00:14:19.000
He came close to winning
it all last year,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.966
and now he's
battling bolder than ever.

00:14:21.966 --> 00:14:25.700
That monster's got the same
attack points as Yuya's
Beast‐Eyes.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.233
He's gotta try to one up 'em.

00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:29.700
Hmm.
I need an Action Card.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.800
I have some bad news
about this monster's
special ability, Yuya.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.400
Since Idaten's Level is higher
than your Beast‐Eyes,

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.833
your dragon's attack points will
drop to zero during battle.

00:14:39.833 --> 00:14:41.000
Oh, great!

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.266
Beast‐Eyes is gonna lose
all its attack points,

00:14:43.266 --> 00:14:46.066
and Yuya's gonna lose 3,000
life points in one strike!

00:14:56.166 --> 00:14:59.900
I'm arming Idaten with the spell
Magic Star Sword!

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.800
Now whenever I send a spell card
from my hand to the graveyard,

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.900
Itaden gains 100
attack points.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.733
Huh?

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.966
That doesn't tickle.

00:15:16.966 --> 00:15:19.200
And I promise
neither will this, Yuya.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.166
I send the Action Spell
I just found to the graveyard.

00:15:22.166 --> 00:15:24.733
So Idaten gains 100
more attack points.

00:15:24.733 --> 00:15:27.333
If he keeps sending Action
Spells to the graveyard,

00:15:27.333 --> 00:15:30.533
then his Idaten is gonna keep on
gaining attack points!

00:15:30.533 --> 00:15:32.100
Huh?

00:15:37.566 --> 00:15:39.933
Uhh!

00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:44.600
Another Action Spell means

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.633
I'm adding another
100 attack points.

00:15:48.233 --> 00:15:51.366
Another hundred points!

00:15:51.366 --> 00:15:54.233
And another hundred!

00:15:54.233 --> 00:15:57.233
And another.

00:15:57.233 --> 00:16:00.100
And once again.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.533
Iggy duels like
a bully‐dozer.

00:16:02.533 --> 00:16:05.866
That monster's almost got enough
attack points to wipe Yuya out!

00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:08.200
I don't see how
he can stop Iggy now.

00:16:10.033 --> 00:16:12.933
I can't let Iggy get one more
Action Spell.

00:16:12.933 --> 00:16:15.033
I gotta find one quick!

00:16:15.033 --> 00:16:17.300
There's absolutely no chance
you can stop me, Yuya.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.600
And why's that!?

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.900
You've been skipping in the
sunshine all your life

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.266
while I've been struggling
my way thru the darkness
to get where I am.

00:16:24.266 --> 00:16:25.733
What are you talking about?!

00:16:25.733 --> 00:16:28.166
Everything I ever had
was taken away from me

00:16:28.166 --> 00:16:31.000
so I'd focus my whole life
on becoming a champion.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.533
Well, I'm not about to let
someone like you stop me!

00:16:33.533 --> 00:16:35.233
We'll see about that!

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:43.300
That card is mine!

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.533
It will never be yours!

00:16:44.533 --> 00:16:48.666
Idaten, attack Beast‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:16:50.733 --> 00:16:52.700
Idaten's special ability
activates!

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.900
Beast‐Eyes loses all of its
attack points.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.866
The path of darkness is the only
possible road to victory.

00:17:00.866 --> 00:17:02.566
(roaring)

00:17:02.566 --> 00:17:03.666
That's crazy!

00:17:03.666 --> 00:17:04.766
Aah!

00:17:04.766 --> 00:17:07.366
Aah!

00:17:10.533 --> 00:17:12.300
Whoa.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.733
What happened?

00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:14.933
Oh, no.

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:17.300
(all)
Where's Yuya?

00:17:23.833 --> 00:17:25.300
(Nico Smiley)
<i>He did it!</i>

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.433
Yuya snatched the Action
Card, but he took big damage.

00:17:28.433 --> 00:17:31.966
He's only got 100
life points left.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.400
I end my turn.

00:17:39.366 --> 00:17:42.633
Maybe your sunny optimism
got you this far,

00:17:42.633 --> 00:17:45.533
but the sun's about to set.

00:17:45.533 --> 00:17:47.700
Huh?

00:17:49.066 --> 00:17:52.366
For you will find that in defeat
lies eternal darkness.

00:17:57.433 --> 00:17:59.300
Uhh! Uhh!

00:18:04.533 --> 00:18:05.733
Huh?

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:22.633
Huh?

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.966
My turn!

00:18:26.966 --> 00:18:29.966
And with it, I will crush any
hope you have of winning!

00:18:29.966 --> 00:18:31.433
I activate...

00:18:31.433 --> 00:18:35.400
the Action Spell
Mad Hurricane!

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.166
This card returns all cards from
my field to my deck.

00:18:39.166 --> 00:18:40.666
Hold on.

00:18:40.666 --> 00:18:42.333
Yuya must have something up
his sleeve?

00:18:42.333 --> 00:18:46.300
I'll use Performapal
Turn Toad and Cheermole

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.000
to set
the Pendulum Scale.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.033
I'm taking control
of this duel starting now!

00:18:56.066 --> 00:19:00.866
Now I'm allowed to summon
Level 4 monsters all
at the same time.

00:19:00.866 --> 00:19:02.766
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:19:02.766 --> 00:19:05.733
Carve the arc
of victory!

00:19:05.733 --> 00:19:11.700
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.433
Coming back are
Performapal Camelump

00:19:14.433 --> 00:19:16.666
and Performapal
Silver Claw.

00:19:16.666 --> 00:19:18.133
This should be good.

00:19:18.133 --> 00:19:21.166
With Level 4 Performapal
Camelump

00:19:21.166 --> 00:19:25.233
and Performapal Silver Claw,
I build the Overlay Network.

00:19:29.566 --> 00:19:32.900
Cloaked in shadows and
relentless in its objective,

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.500
I call upon the most dangerous
of Dragons.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.833
(roaring)

00:19:36.833 --> 00:19:42.700
I Xyz Summon Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon!

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.966
(roaring)

00:19:45.966 --> 00:19:49.233
What the... Yuya knows
how to Xyz Summon?

00:19:49.233 --> 00:19:50.400
It can't be?

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.366
How does he have Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon?!

00:19:53.366 --> 00:19:57.100
(thinking)
That monster belongs to Yuto,
not him!

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.933
I'm now activating Dark
Rebellion Xyz Dragon's ability.

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:03.600
With it, by using one
Overlay Unit,

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.066
the attack points
of your Idaten are cut in half!

00:20:06.066 --> 00:20:10.433
And then Dark Rebellion Xyz
Dragon gains those
attack points.

00:20:15.833 --> 00:20:17.733
(roaring)

00:20:17.733 --> 00:20:20.700
And what can be done once,
can be done again.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.500
I use the remaining
Overlay Unit

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.400
to activate Dark Rebellion's
special ability once more!

00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:31.566
It's too powerful!

00:20:31.566 --> 00:20:33.533
Show no mercy!

00:20:33.533 --> 00:20:36.566
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon,

00:20:36.566 --> 00:20:39.900
decimate Idaten,
The Conqueror Star!

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.933
I activate Idaten's
special ability!

00:20:43.933 --> 00:20:46.266
When it battles a monster
with a lower level,

00:20:46.266 --> 00:20:50.033
your monster's attack points
are completely wiped out!

00:20:50.033 --> 00:20:52.700
Xyz Monsters have Ranks,
not Levels.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.233
So that ability
won't save you.

00:20:54.233 --> 00:20:56.233
Oh, no, there's
nothing I can do

00:20:56.233 --> 00:20:58.300
to stop his Dragon
from attacking!

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.400
(Yuya)
Mauling Mandible Charge!

00:21:04.333 --> 00:21:06.800
Aah!

00:21:15.166 --> 00:21:19.000
(Nico Smiley)
The, the winner
is Yuya Sakaki.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.700
Uh, Nice goin', Yuya,
I guess.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.966
Yuya is seeming
scary.

00:21:23.966 --> 00:21:25.433
Definitely.

00:21:25.433 --> 00:21:26.566
Yeah, something's off.

00:21:29.866 --> 00:21:31.833
Huh?

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:32.833
Huh?

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:35.066
Iggy!

00:21:35.066 --> 00:21:38.133
Here let me help you!

00:21:38.133 --> 00:21:40.233
Uhh!

00:21:51.433 --> 00:21:53.100
Huh?

00:21:59.366 --> 00:22:01.066
I may have won,

00:22:01.066 --> 00:22:04.933
but why do
I feel like I lost?

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:09.433
