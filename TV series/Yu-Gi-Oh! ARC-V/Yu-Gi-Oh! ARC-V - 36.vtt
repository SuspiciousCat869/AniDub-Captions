WEBVTT

00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:07.466
(Yuya)
Previously on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh!
Arc‐V"...

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.700
Poor Sora.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.933
I know.

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.566
After all, it's not every
day someone gets injured

00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.300
in a duel for real.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.900
(Yuya)
And it's all Shay's fault.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.633
(Gong)
So let Gong get
this straight.

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:20.466
Shay's sister is one of the
friends they're trying to save?

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.133
That's what Yuto told me.

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.733
Then that means they must think
Sora knows where she is.

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.266
For the last time...

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.866
Bring me Shay!

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.966
We both know that you're
no match for him.

00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.866
Wrong‐‐ He could never
beat me twice in a row!

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.866
See, we're the ones who hunt
down you Xyz Summoners,

00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.266
not the other way around!

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.733
Not happening.

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:48.100
I'm going to rescue Lulu,
and it starts right here!

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.366
Let's Duel!
Let's Duel!

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.833
Sora?

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:53.400
What in the world?

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.300
He looks just like me.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.366
I Xyz Summon!

00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:01.366
Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon!

00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.733
Take down
Frightfur Bear!

00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.566
Mauling Mandible
Charge!

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.300
(screaming)

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.666
Sora!

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.366
I do not wish
to fight.

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.033
So if Sora
surrenders,

00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:19.833
this can be settled without
any further suffering.

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:22.933
Now lay down your duel disk
and tell me what I want to know!

00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:27.133
I won't let you hurt my friend
any more than you already have!

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.966
Which is why I'm
joining this duel!

(Declan)
Things are becoming
quite interesting.

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:49.200
I wonder how Yuya
will fair against Yuto.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.666
It's showtime!

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:54.966
And time to put you in your
place for messing with Sora!

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:58.233
'Cause now I'm part
of this duel!

00:02:58.233 --> 00:02:59.700
(computer)
Battle royal
mode engaged.

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:06.566
Here goes!

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:10.200
I'll use Stargazer Magician
and Timegazer Magician

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.233
to set
the Pendulum Scale!

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:18.000
I'm taking control of
this duel starting now!

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.300
I can summon monsters
from Level 2 through 7

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.133
all at the same time!

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:23.666
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:03:23.666 --> 00:03:25.300
Carve the arc
of victory!

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.800
My monster's ready
to swing into action!

00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:35.833
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:37.166
(growling)

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.366
(Yuya)
Whoa...

00:03:42.366 --> 00:03:44.433
Never felt like this when I've
summoned Odd‐Eyes before.

00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:52.200
(growling)

00:03:56.533 --> 00:03:58.833
(shrieking)

00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:00.533
(roaring)

00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:05.933
(Claude)
The two dragons...

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:09.000
It looks like they're
speaking to each other.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.633
(Yuya)
Odd‐Eyes, let's put
you to good use!

00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:13.100
It's time for
you to charge in

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.300
and take out Dark
Rebellion Xyz Dragon

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.866
with all of your Pendulum
power and might!

00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:19.166
Attack!

00:04:24.833 --> 00:04:26.200
What's Yuya doing?

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.766
Both monsters have
2,500 attack points.

00:04:28.766 --> 00:04:30.766
They both will
be destroyed.

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:32.033
True...

00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:34.300
But Odd‐Eyes is
a Pendulum Monster.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.600
It's sent to Yuya's extra deck
instead of the graveyard,

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:41.566
so Yuya can summon
it again later.

00:04:48.866 --> 00:04:50.600
(roaring)

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.166
You never saw
this coming...

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:05.200
I activate the trap card
Phantom Fog Blade!

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.700
Now your Dragon's
attack is stopped!

00:05:11.233 --> 00:05:13.300
And as long as this
blade is out,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.333
Your Dragon can
no longer attack,

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:16.333
so Odd‐Eyes
is powerless!

00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:22.266
(Declan)
Yuto had a trap that
could stop attacks?

00:05:22.266 --> 00:05:24.166
Then that means
earlier in our duel,

00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:25.900
he could've stopped my
Frightfur's attack!

00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:34.033
(Declan)
Yuto didn't want
to stop Sora's attack

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:35.800
because he's willing to
take a small loss

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.666
for victory in the end.

00:05:39.666 --> 00:05:40.700
You sneak!

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.966
You knew that
by taking the attack

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:44.166
you'd be able to summon
a better monster!

00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:47.100
But it still doesn't explain why
you didn't use that Overlay Unit

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.466
to take me down
when you could've!

00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:51.800
Unless...

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.300
You're holding yourself back
and toying around with me!

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.566
And there's no
greater insult than that!

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:00.300
You hear me?

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.500
(Yuya)
You might be taking
it easy but not me!

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.666
Here goes.

00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:10.533
I activate Timegazer
Magician's Pendulum ability!

00:06:10.533 --> 00:06:12.600
I'm rewinding time so
it's as if your trap

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.166
never activated
in the first place!

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.300
Infinity Gear Reverse!

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.233
All right!

00:06:27.233 --> 00:06:29.000
I play a new trap!

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.333
Booby Trap E!

00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:34.966
It mimics the effect
of my Phantom Fog Blade.

00:06:34.966 --> 00:06:36.500
But that means...

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.866
Phantom Fog Blade is
totally back in action.

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:41.366
Right.

00:06:41.366 --> 00:06:44.166
So it can stop your
Dragon's attack again.

00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:46.466
And as long as it remains
on the field,

00:06:46.466 --> 00:06:50.266
your Odd‐Eyes
can never attack.

00:06:50.266 --> 00:06:51.666
In that case...

00:06:51.666 --> 00:06:54.133
I end my turn.

00:06:54.133 --> 00:06:55.433
End your turn?

00:06:55.433 --> 00:06:57.266
Your completely
useless!

00:06:57.266 --> 00:06:58.666
Hey!

00:06:58.666 --> 00:07:02.166
If you really want to
help, stop trying to help!

00:07:02.166 --> 00:07:03.966
What's up with you?

00:07:03.966 --> 00:07:05.733
Why are you acting so
weird all of a sudden?

00:07:07.766 --> 00:07:09.566
I wanna know...

00:07:09.566 --> 00:07:12.233
You were acting the same
way when you dueled Shay.

00:07:12.233 --> 00:07:14.833
Why're you being
so mean?

00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:18.000
You gotta tell
me what's going on!

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.900
I'm your friend, be
honest with me.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.233
Zuzu told me
about Shay's sister.

00:07:23.233 --> 00:07:25.333
I think they think you
know where Lulu is.

00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:27.766
(gasping)

00:07:27.766 --> 00:07:30.000
What?
Zuzu said that?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.833
That's right...

00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:35.566
She said that she
heard it from Yuto.

00:07:35.566 --> 00:07:37.266
You're Yuto, right?

00:07:37.266 --> 00:07:38.400
So spill!

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.200
Is it all true?

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.900
(Yuya)
Is that what this
is all about?

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.266
It is.

00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:45.533
Okay, then.

00:07:45.533 --> 00:07:48.566
So why do you think Sora
is mixed up in all this?

00:07:48.566 --> 00:07:52.233
What does he have to do with
you saving Shay's sister?

00:07:52.233 --> 00:07:55.866
Why won't
you answer me?

00:07:55.866 --> 00:07:57.833
Say something!

00:07:57.833 --> 00:07:59.000
Ha!

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.700
I'll tell you why
he won't talk.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.300
Because then he'd
have to admit out loud...

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.833
How he's part of
the losing team.

00:08:06.833 --> 00:08:08.600
(chuckles)

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.033
Losing team?

00:08:10.033 --> 00:08:11.866
They're toothless!

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.400
(crunching)

00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:18.100
But if he won't
talk, I will...

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.600
When my people put
their foot down

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.000
and gained control
of the Xyz Dimension.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.633
They all fled like rats
on a sinking ship.

00:08:24.633 --> 00:08:26.033
Xyz Dimension?

00:08:26.033 --> 00:08:27.166
Enough!

00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:29.766
You know not of
what you speak, Sora.

00:08:29.766 --> 00:08:33.333
We never fled our home!

00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:35.466
We left so we could
fight another day!

00:08:35.466 --> 00:08:38.300
Against those from
your Fusion Dimension!

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.900
There's a
Fusion Dimension?

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.833
And a Xyz Dimension?

00:08:43.833 --> 00:08:45.666
And you're bouncing
between them?

00:08:45.666 --> 00:08:47.833
Sorta but for this
guy and his pal

00:08:47.833 --> 00:08:50.233
it was more like
running instead of bouncing.

00:08:50.233 --> 00:08:52.766
Because they hightailed it
out of their dimension

00:08:52.766 --> 00:08:54.833
when we came calling.

00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:56.866
You really
attacked them.

00:08:56.866 --> 00:08:58.166
That's right.

00:08:58.166 --> 00:08:59.800
You should have seen them
when my crew and I

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.533
took the battle to them!

00:09:01.533 --> 00:09:03.700
And in that battle
we were victorious

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.366
just like I'll be
in this duel!

00:09:06.366 --> 00:09:07.600
You see...

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.833
It's my destiny
to conquer!

00:09:09.833 --> 00:09:12.000
After all,
back at Duel Academy,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.800
I was selected as top in my
class and since I was...

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.933
I was then chosen
for a special mission, too!

00:09:19.933 --> 00:09:21.833
A mission I won't fail.

00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:23.966
It's my turn!

00:09:23.966 --> 00:09:26.000
I activate
my facedown card!

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.766
The trap Designer
Frightfur!

00:09:28.766 --> 00:09:31.966
It lets me summon Edge Imp
Tomahawk from my graveyard

00:09:31.966 --> 00:09:35.400
but I can treat it like it's
a Frightfur monster!

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.966
Next, I'll activate Edge Imp
Frightfuloid's special ability

00:09:38.966 --> 00:09:40.833
from the graveyard!

00:09:40.833 --> 00:09:43.066
So I can treat it like
it's a Frightfur monster, too!

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.666
And I'm fusing them
together...

00:09:46.666 --> 00:09:49.766
By activating
Frightfur Fusion...

00:09:49.766 --> 00:09:53.000
By fusing Edge Imp Tomahawk,
Edge Imp Frightfuloid

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.700
and Frightfur Bear.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.866
I can Fusion Summon a
ferocious new Frightfur monster!

00:09:58.866 --> 00:10:02.166
And now, Yuto, it's time
for you to witness

00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:06.066
the reason why I was
selected top in my class...

00:10:06.066 --> 00:10:10.133
Get ready to be floored, by the
most furious Fusion Monster

00:10:10.133 --> 00:10:11.933
you've ever seen!

00:10:11.933 --> 00:10:16.300
(crackling and beeping)

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.733
Huh?

00:10:17.733 --> 00:10:18.800
Awww...

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.866
No!

00:10:19.866 --> 00:10:21.600
You can't
take me away now!

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.633
Say what?
Quiet!

00:10:23.633 --> 00:10:25.000
Hello?
Someone?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.166
Anyone!

00:10:26.166 --> 00:10:28.366
Just let me stay
'til I beat him!

00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:30.833
Trust me,
I can do it!

00:10:30.833 --> 00:10:32.800
Don't take me away!

00:10:38.666 --> 00:10:40.400
Don't take me away!

00:10:43.766 --> 00:10:47.166
Uh, Sora?

00:10:47.166 --> 00:10:48.766
Yuto!
Where is he?

00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:51.600
What did you do
to Sora?

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.166
Sora went back
to his dimension.

00:10:54.166 --> 00:10:55.866
But not by choice.

00:10:55.866 --> 00:10:57.500
It seems...

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.166
He was taken against
his will.

00:11:00.166 --> 00:11:03.833
I find it quite intriguing
that it happened when it did...

00:11:03.833 --> 00:11:06.033
Before Sora could
share too much.

00:11:06.033 --> 00:11:08.200
Intriguing indeed.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.433
Sora returned to
the Fusion Dimension.

00:11:10.433 --> 00:11:11.366
His home.

00:11:11.366 --> 00:11:12.466
His home?

00:11:12.466 --> 00:11:13.600
Correct.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.833
Just like me...

00:11:15.833 --> 00:11:17.966
He comes from
another world.

00:11:17.966 --> 00:11:20.900
Enough of this
nonsense!

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.233
There are no other
worlds out there!

00:11:23.233 --> 00:11:25.300
There's just
this one.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.700
So quit messing around
already and tell me the truth!

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.000
And whatever you do,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.566
please don't just tell me
that you already have!

00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:34.100
I have.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.566
Aw, come on!

00:11:35.566 --> 00:11:37.900
I said don't
tell me that!

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.033
Now for
the last time...

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:43.400
I want you to tell me
where my friend Sora is!

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.300
As I said.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.233
He's home.

00:11:46.233 --> 00:11:47.700
At Duel Academy.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.700
Duel Academy?

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.266
Sora did
mention that...

00:11:52.266 --> 00:11:55.700
Okay, tell me more about
this Duel Academy.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.900
It's a school that teaches
its members to duel.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.966
And not in
a good way.

00:12:00.966 --> 00:12:03.833
They train duel
warriors there.

00:12:03.833 --> 00:12:05.233
Duel warriors?

00:12:25.633 --> 00:12:27.166
(shuttering)

00:12:28.833 --> 00:12:31.666
(man)
Some students found Sora
unconscious on campus.

00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:33.766
We had him
hospitalized immediately.

00:12:33.766 --> 00:12:36.766
As for how he got there, we
analyzed his Duel Disk.

00:12:36.766 --> 00:12:38.500
The failsafe activated.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.500
He must have
revealed something.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.833
So long as he did not
reveal everything.

00:12:43.833 --> 00:12:46.800
I understand.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.733
You will find out more by
running a full diagnostic

00:12:49.733 --> 00:12:51.600
on his memories.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.500
Make it so.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.900
Yes, sir!

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.266
It will be done exactly as
you have commanded, Professor.

00:13:12.733 --> 00:13:13.933
Enough talk.

00:13:13.933 --> 00:13:15.866
Let's get back
to the battle...

00:13:15.866 --> 00:13:17.300
After all, Yuya...

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.166
Even though Sora
is long gone.

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:21.766
We have a
duel to finish.

00:13:21.766 --> 00:13:23.733
And finish it
I shall.

00:13:23.733 --> 00:13:26.866
I activate the spell
Emergency Provisions.

00:13:26.866 --> 00:13:29.166
For every spell or trap
card on my field

00:13:29.166 --> 00:13:31.233
that I send
to the graveyard,

00:13:31.233 --> 00:13:35.166
I gain an additional 1,000
life points.

00:13:35.166 --> 00:13:37.766
And with that,
I end my turn.

00:13:37.766 --> 00:13:38.933
Why do that?

00:13:38.933 --> 00:13:41.033
By getting rid of those
traps you just tossed,

00:13:41.033 --> 00:13:42.400
my Odd‐Eyes can
now attack you!

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.000
Very well.
So be it.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.700
Forget it!
Game over!

00:14:00.166 --> 00:14:01.533
Sorry, Yuto,

00:14:01.533 --> 00:14:04.033
but, I can tell when someone's
about to let me win,

00:14:04.033 --> 00:14:05.600
so if your heart's
not in this...

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.300
I'd rather stop
this duel right now.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.966
But to be honest,

00:14:09.966 --> 00:14:13.433
it seems to me that your
heart was never in this.

00:14:13.433 --> 00:14:15.700
After all, you could've
beaten Sora earlier

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.966
if you used two Overlay
Units but you didn't.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.533
It's almost like you didn't
really want to hurt Sora.

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:28.666
But why?

00:14:28.666 --> 00:14:30.200
Simply put,

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.533
my people are not fond
of bringing harm to others.

00:14:33.533 --> 00:14:35.900
I know that it's hard for
you to believe me...

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.733
But it's true.

00:14:37.733 --> 00:14:40.400
Yuya, we are
the real victims here.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.233
Our homeland was attacked by
the Fusion Warriors.

00:14:44.233 --> 00:14:48.100
They created a war!

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.033
However, to fight...

00:14:50.033 --> 00:14:52.533
Is not the nature
of my people.

00:14:52.533 --> 00:14:54.333
We duel for
one reason:

00:14:54.333 --> 00:14:57.166
For just the simple
joy of it all.

00:14:57.166 --> 00:14:59.766
Well, that is...

00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:01.766
Before we
were attacked.

00:15:01.766 --> 00:15:04.400
I'll never forget...

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.300
It was a
beautiful day.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.366
And all my people
were enjoying it.

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:10.500
Strolling along in the parks.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.200
Laughing with
one another.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.266
Dueling
their decks out.

00:15:14.266 --> 00:15:16.266
But then, the clouds
turned dark...

00:15:21.533 --> 00:15:22.600
It was them.

00:15:27.666 --> 00:15:29.366
And they came with
orders to destroy.

00:15:38.633 --> 00:15:40.466
They laid waste
to my city.

00:15:40.466 --> 00:15:42.766
Destroying
everything in their path.

00:15:42.766 --> 00:15:44.966
They were relentless
in their objective.

00:15:44.966 --> 00:15:46.433
Merciless.

00:15:46.433 --> 00:15:48.266
There was
nowhere to hide.

00:15:48.266 --> 00:15:50.900
All we could
do was run.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.500
And soon,
everything was gone.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:58.533
All of our history,
all of our culture...

00:15:58.533 --> 00:16:00.766
As for my people,

00:16:00.766 --> 00:16:04.600
they captured them by trapping
their souls into cards.

00:16:09.733 --> 00:16:10.900
(Shay)
My home.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.100
My people.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:13.566
They took it
all away.

00:16:17.766 --> 00:16:20.200
Declan?

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.400
(Yuya)
No offense...

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.333
But that's a
crazy story.

00:16:23.333 --> 00:16:26.800
Like something from
a sci‐fi movie!

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.600
I wish that
it were.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.700
That it
wasn't true..

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.200
But I was there.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.100
I saw it
happen.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.000
And there is more fighting
happening right now Yuya.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.933
Much more.

00:16:38.933 --> 00:16:40.500
For you see,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.400
there are more places
beyond your world.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.300
Like, more
dimensions, you mean?

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.133
Wait a second.

00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:50.466
There's Fusion
and Xyz...

00:16:53.166 --> 00:16:55.833
Are there
other dimensions?

00:16:55.833 --> 00:16:57.033
Yes.

00:16:57.033 --> 00:17:00.466
There's a Synchro
Dimension, too.

00:17:00.466 --> 00:17:01.933
And it has
its own warriors.

00:17:05.433 --> 00:17:07.200
Believe me, Yuya.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.666
I know that this must all
come as quite a shock...

00:17:10.666 --> 00:17:15.133
But, the truth
often is shocking.

00:17:15.133 --> 00:17:16.533
What about here?

00:17:16.533 --> 00:17:21.033
I mean, how does this world
factor into everything?

00:17:21.033 --> 00:17:23.066
Well, this world...

00:17:23.066 --> 00:17:26.066
Has come to be known simply
as the Standard Dimension.

00:17:26.066 --> 00:17:27.666
The Standard Dimension?

00:17:27.666 --> 00:17:29.066
Yes.

00:17:29.066 --> 00:17:31.400
It's the core that all the other
dimensions revolve around.

00:17:34.833 --> 00:17:36.666
(man)
Are you sure
this is necessary?

00:17:36.666 --> 00:17:38.233
(man)
Quite sure.

00:17:38.233 --> 00:17:41.733
I have orders from the Professor
himself to find out all we can

00:17:41.733 --> 00:17:44.166
about what little
Sora learned...

00:17:44.166 --> 00:17:46.133
We should have
our answers soon.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.900
(Yuya)
So let me get this straight
there are four dimensions:

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.666
Fusion, Xyz,
Synchro and Standard,

00:17:58.666 --> 00:18:00.800
and they're all
fighting each other?

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.233
But why?

00:18:02.233 --> 00:18:05.100
Why would the dimensions
all want to do this?

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.033
One man:

00:18:07.033 --> 00:18:10.066
Leo Akaba.

00:18:10.066 --> 00:18:14.233
Look, you're throwing a lot of
crazy information my way.

00:18:14.233 --> 00:18:16.733
Dimensions
fighting dimensions.

00:18:16.733 --> 00:18:20.066
I can't believe people are
dueling to destroy.

00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:21.933
This doesn't
seem real.

00:18:21.933 --> 00:18:23.366
It can't be.

00:18:23.366 --> 00:18:25.633
Dueling is supposed
to be fun.

00:18:25.633 --> 00:18:28.166
It's supposed to
make everyone happy!

00:18:28.166 --> 00:18:33.533
It's the ultimate form
of entertainment!

00:18:33.533 --> 00:18:36.300
At least, that's
what I was taught...

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.033
By my Dad.

00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:41.266
I'll never forget
what he said to me...

00:18:41.266 --> 00:18:43.800
He said that dueling
wasn't about taking.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.200
It was about
giving.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.366
Giving your best.

00:18:46.366 --> 00:18:48.433
Giving the crowd
what they wanted.

00:18:48.433 --> 00:18:51.833
And the more I watched him, the
more I understood what he meant,

00:18:51.833 --> 00:18:55.266
which is why today, I'm doing
my best to be just like him,

00:18:55.266 --> 00:18:57.500
and I'm gonna get
there, too!

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.233
Ladies, gentlemen,
duelists of all ages!

00:19:00.233 --> 00:19:03.466
As you can see, there are no
cards left on my field,

00:19:03.466 --> 00:19:06.000
and I have no cards
in my hand, either!

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.033
That means that everything is
riding on this very next draw

00:19:09.033 --> 00:19:11.266
and if that's
not dueltainment,

00:19:11.266 --> 00:19:13.500
well then, I guess
don't know what is.

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:19.866
Draw!

00:19:22.633 --> 00:19:24.066
All right!

00:19:24.066 --> 00:19:26.033
Both these guys are playing
out of their minds!

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.966
What in the world?

00:19:36.433 --> 00:19:37.766
So pretty...

00:19:37.766 --> 00:19:38.800
What a show!

00:19:40.766 --> 00:19:43.533
(crowd)
Yeah, Yuya!

00:19:43.533 --> 00:19:47.800
(Yuya)
I believe that dueling can make
this world a better place!

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.400
So to hear that it's being used
by some in a way to hurt others?

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.500
That's wrong!

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.633
Yuya...

00:19:57.633 --> 00:19:59.066
(Yuya)
What is that?

00:20:02.766 --> 00:20:04.533
(Claude)
What happened?
Where's the feed?

00:20:04.533 --> 00:20:05.600
I don't
know, sir.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.866
It's gone!

00:20:06.866 --> 00:20:09.733
All our cameras in
the area have shorted out!

00:20:09.733 --> 00:20:11.533
Fix it now!

00:20:33.533 --> 00:20:36.633
It's you.

00:20:36.633 --> 00:20:37.633
Whoa...

00:20:37.633 --> 00:20:38.800
Hold on...

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.066
You're who I've been
searching for!

00:20:41.066 --> 00:20:44.300
For a long time, too!

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.800
Uh...

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.466
Would someone mind telling me
why there's now another guy

00:20:48.466 --> 00:20:50.933
who looks just
like me?

00:20:50.933 --> 00:20:53.366
'Cause this is starting to
get really strange here...
