00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.200
(Yuya)
Previously on "YuGiOh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.333
(Sylvio)
Welcome to the Leo Institute
of Dueling!

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.700
(excited gasping)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.300
Hey!

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.066
These gents have also
become big fans of yours.

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.633
They're curious about the
cards you use to Pendulum
Summon.

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:18.666
(Yuya)
Here they‐‐

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:19.933
They're mine.

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.800
I'm adding them to my
rare card collection!

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.366
Oh, So that's why you
invited Yuya to your school!

00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.033
It's not the only reason.

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.566
Naturally, I need to learn
how to use the cards.

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.900
(man)
Dueling wasn't
part of the plan.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.900
Report here immediately
with the cards and‐‐

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.766
(man)
No!

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:35.866
Let him be.

00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:38.000
Mr. President...

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.933
Do not interfere
with Sylvio.

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.933
(all)
Yuya, help us!

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:44.233
Now I'll select
an Action Field.

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:46.600
Prison Tower of Darkville!

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.566
(screaming)

00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:49.833
Yuya!

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:50.966
Get us down
from here!

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.600
I'm coming, guys!

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.233
(Sylvio)
You want to save
your friends?

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:58.466
Then give me what I want.

00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.066
Duel me now.

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.400
All right, then...

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.266
(both)
Let's duel.

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.133
Do exactly as you're told.

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:09.266
For my first move, I select
Scale 1 Stargazer Magician...

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:12.033
You will also use your Scale 8
Timegazer Magician!

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:14.400
... and my Scale 8
Timegazer Magician!

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.533
And next, you'll set...
And next, I'll set...

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.700
the Pendulum Scale!
the Pendulum Scale!

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.433
(both)
Pendulum Summon!

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:20.633
(Sylvio)
Monsters, emerge!

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.666
It worked!

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:26.066
Well done, Sylvio.

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.700
Now take aim
and strike Yuya down!

It worked!?

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:34.766
(Sylvio)
I got three monsters,
just like that!

00:02:34.766 --> 00:02:36.566
Pendulum Summoning is sweet!

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.933
I've become the most powerful
duelist in the world!

00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:43.666
And now that I can
Pendulum Summon on my own,

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:46.733
I think I'll use that power
to finish you off!

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:48.100
You'll make an easy target

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.433
for my Dart Strikers!

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.500
Power Dart Striker,
I'll let you do the honors!

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.000
Blast Yuya's Skeeter
Skimmer out of the water!

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.600
Quick, get moving!

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.200
Ah! An Action Card!

00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:09.900
(grunting)

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:13.066
Oh no, not again!

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:14.133
Don't do it!

00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:15.666
It could be another trap!

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:18.633
Hah, I see you finally managed
to learn something.

00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:21.533
But there's nothing
you can do to save yourself.

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:24.300
My Skeeter Skimmer's schemier
than you think!

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.800
By switching to defense mode,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.066
it can deflect your Darts
so they miss their mark!

00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:33.033
That bug's really
starting to bug me!

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:35.000
Good thing, I have two more
Dart Strikers

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.300
eager for target practice!

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.300
Rocket Dart Striker,
fire when ready!

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.533
Torpedo that Skeeter Skimmer!

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:46.800
Whoa...

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.233
I just sunk
your bug boat, twerp!

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:57.433
And now, Ultimate Dart Striker
will sink you.

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:00.566
(nervous groan)

00:04:00.566 --> 00:04:03.733
Ultimate Dart Striker,
attack Yuya directly!

00:04:03.733 --> 00:04:05.500
Dart Destruction!

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.034
(Sylvio)
Ultimate Dart Striker,
attack Yuya directly!

00:04:24.034 --> 00:04:25.834
Dart Destruction!

00:04:38.934 --> 00:04:41.367
(crying)

00:04:41.367 --> 00:04:43.200
I'm a goner!

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.600
(Yuza)
No, you're not!

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.834
Yuya won't give up till
he gets us down from here

00:04:46.834 --> 00:04:48.667
so stay calm and hang on!

00:04:48.667 --> 00:04:51.200
Okay?

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.934
(Sylvio)
I'll end my turn now.

00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:56.234
Then I'll give you one last
chance to beg me for mercy.

00:04:56.234 --> 00:04:57.534
It's the only possible way

00:04:57.534 --> 00:05:00.000
you can save yourself
and your friends.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
(Yuya)
I can't trust that creep
to free Zuzu and the others!

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.734
But how am I supposed
to put up a fight,

00:05:04.734 --> 00:05:07.234
when Silvio's
holding my go‐to cards?

00:05:07.234 --> 00:05:10.267
I wish my Dad were here to help
me come up with an answer!

00:05:12.334 --> 00:05:14.434
(man)
Try to laugh
when you feel like crying.

00:05:14.434 --> 00:05:16.700
And when things get tough...

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.634
respond with a smile.

00:05:18.634 --> 00:05:21.167
It will give you the strength
to keep moving forward!

00:05:27.167 --> 00:05:29.667
(Yuya laughing)

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:31.667
You're about to lose
and your laughing?

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:32.734
I guess it makes sense

00:05:32.734 --> 00:05:35.834
'cause your dueling has
been pretty hysterical.

00:05:35.834 --> 00:05:39.200
(Yuya)
I'm not gonna let this
guy rock my confidence!

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.834
It's showtime!

00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:44.034
I draw!

00:05:45.034 --> 00:05:47.700
♪

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.234
I summon the web weaving
Block Spider!

00:05:55.467 --> 00:05:59.400
That eight legged loser is as
pathetic and weak as you are.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.300
If you're trying
to intimidate me,

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.800
you failed miserably.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.134
Go ahead and attack me!

00:06:06.434 --> 00:06:07.800
In a few seconds,
you're gonna regret

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.267
you ever gave me
this card, Sylvio.

00:06:10.267 --> 00:06:12.067
That was one of my cards?

00:06:12.067 --> 00:06:15.134
I don't even remember
having it in my deck.

00:06:15.134 --> 00:06:18.034
Block Spider can spin
a protective web

00:06:18.034 --> 00:06:21.134
that'll shield any monsters
I have from being attacked!

00:06:21.134 --> 00:06:23.467
That might be useful
if you actually had any other

00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:24.600
monsters on your field...

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.800
but it's all alone.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.767
Not for long!

00:06:28.767 --> 00:06:32.634
First, I have to switch
Block Spider into defense mode!

00:06:32.634 --> 00:06:34.767
Go for it, Blocky!

00:06:34.767 --> 00:06:38.267
That'll let me activate
my spell Mimiclay!

00:06:38.267 --> 00:06:41.067
A famous magician
conjured up Mimiclay

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:44.534
so he could make exact replicas
of anything he desired!

00:06:44.534 --> 00:06:45.800
As a spell card,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.634
it can morph itself into any
monster on the field...

00:06:48.634 --> 00:06:50.234
and not just in appearance,

00:06:50.234 --> 00:06:53.667
it also gains the same abilities
of the monster it copies!

00:06:53.667 --> 00:06:57.600
So you're going to replicate one
of my Dart monsters, is that it?

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.700
Sorry, but you're
a bit off the mark.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.667
I'm using Mimiclay
to duplicate...

00:07:02.667 --> 00:07:06.034
the monster on my field!

00:07:06.034 --> 00:07:07.367
Block Spider?

00:07:07.367 --> 00:07:08.934
(Yuya)
That's right, Silvio!

00:07:08.934 --> 00:07:10.834
And here's' another shocker!

00:07:10.834 --> 00:07:12.067
The newly copied monster

00:07:12.067 --> 00:07:14.367
is automatically
summoned to my field.

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:17.534
So now you have two worthless
web weaving weaklings

00:07:17.534 --> 00:07:18.467
instead of just one!

00:07:18.467 --> 00:07:19.634
No...

00:07:19.634 --> 00:07:22.400
Block Spider's a lot
tougher than you think!

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.634
When there's two of them
they can do this...

00:07:24.634 --> 00:07:25.967
Block Lock!

00:07:25.967 --> 00:07:29.600
Now your three Dart Strikers
aren't able to attack me!

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.900
How could I let those lousy
cards ground my monsters!

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.400
(Yuya)
He may think
these cards are useless,

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.867
but I know they'll
come through for me.

00:07:37.867 --> 00:07:41.267
I'll place two cards facedown
and end my turn.

00:07:41.267 --> 00:07:42.834
It's your move!

00:07:42.834 --> 00:07:44.467
(growling)

00:07:44.467 --> 00:07:45.700
Now I draw!

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:48.800
(beeping)
Huh?

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.700
(Declan)
According to my analysis,

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.300
those two Magicians are
currently Spell Cards.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.434
That may be the trick
you need right now.

00:07:55.434 --> 00:07:57.034
They're spells?

00:07:57.034 --> 00:07:58.334
They're not
monsters right now?

00:08:01.967 --> 00:08:05.734
Pendulum Cards are almost
as amazing as I am!

00:08:05.734 --> 00:08:08.867
I'll use the spell Cricket
Close to close out your
strategy!

00:08:08.867 --> 00:08:11.234
It lets me negate
the effects

00:08:11.234 --> 00:08:13.267
of one of your cards.

00:08:13.267 --> 00:08:15.867
As long as I negate
two spells on my field.

00:08:15.867 --> 00:08:17.500
Huh?

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.200
Better double‐check
your field, Sylvio.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.567
You don't have the two
spell cards you need!

00:08:24.667 --> 00:08:26.667
Or so you think.

00:08:26.667 --> 00:08:28.834
Clearly, you haven't
understood the true potential

00:08:28.834 --> 00:08:32.167
of the Pendulum cards
you "traded" away!

00:08:32.167 --> 00:08:35.200
My Magicians are
treated as spell cards!

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.734
Stargazer and Timegazer's
effects are negated

00:08:37.734 --> 00:08:40.100
so that Cricket Close
can spin into action!

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.034
(monsters grunting)

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.067
(Sylvio)
I'll use its power to deform
your pliable pal

00:08:54.067 --> 00:08:55.934
back into a dumpy lump!

00:08:55.934 --> 00:08:57.400
My Mimiclay!

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.134
(Sylvio)
Since it's lost its effect,

00:08:59.134 --> 00:09:02.134
your Mimiclay gets
sent to the graveyard!

00:09:04.134 --> 00:09:06.234
(growling)

00:09:06.234 --> 00:09:07.567
Without Mimiclay,

00:09:07.567 --> 00:09:11.534
your Block Spider is once again
exposed as a third‐rate monster.

00:09:11.534 --> 00:09:13.167
It's a perfect match for you,

00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:15.334
since you're
a third‐rate duelist!

00:09:15.334 --> 00:09:17.300
I'll finish both of you
easily now!

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.734
Don't count me out yet!

00:09:19.734 --> 00:09:22.734
I activate the spell
Draw Muscle!

00:09:22.734 --> 00:09:24.734
It helps me
muscle up a monster!

00:09:24.734 --> 00:09:27.734
Since my Block Spider has less
than 1,000 defense points,

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.967
I can draw one card
from my deck!

00:09:29.967 --> 00:09:31.367
If I draw a monster card,

00:09:31.367 --> 00:09:35.234
I can add its defense points to
strengthen my Spider's shield!

00:09:35.234 --> 00:09:37.234
Everything depends
on this draw...

00:09:37.234 --> 00:09:40.567
... and I can't hold back!

00:09:40.567 --> 00:09:41.600
Excellent!

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.000
This might sting a bit!

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.834
I just drew
Kaleidoscorp!

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:46.900
It has 2,300 defense points

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.200
and thanks
to Draw Muscle

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.867
I can add those points
on to my Block Spider!

00:09:54.167 --> 00:09:56.267
Luck sure is on your side...

00:09:56.267 --> 00:09:59.067
but I'll still find a way to
take your Block Spider apart!

00:09:59.067 --> 00:10:00.500
(Yuya)
Go ahead and try!

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.167
Draw Muscle has another effect

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:04.267
that makes my Spider
indestructible.

00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:06.267
So it's safe and sound!

00:10:06.267 --> 00:10:10.167
(Sylvio)
You're trying to make me look
like a fool, aren't you?

00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:13.434
But there's only one fool on
this field and isn't me.

00:10:13.434 --> 00:10:16.000
(Sylvio laughing)

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.434
With my superior
grasp of dueling,

00:10:18.434 --> 00:10:21.000
I knew you'd make a last‐ditch
move to save yourself.

00:10:23.467 --> 00:10:25.967
So I held back
to test your defenses.

00:10:25.967 --> 00:10:28.167
Now that I've exposed
your strategy,

00:10:28.167 --> 00:10:30.934
I can increase
my onslaught accordingly!

00:10:30.934 --> 00:10:34.267
I tribute Power Dart Striker
and Rocket Dart Striker,

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:36.200
which will allow me
to crank up the firepower

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.634
of Ultimate Dart Striker!

00:10:38.634 --> 00:10:42.134

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.867

dart dealer ever devised,

00:10:48.667 --> 00:10:51.134
but thanks to Power Dart's
special ability,

00:10:51.134 --> 00:10:54.634
Ultimate Dart Striker gains
another 600 attack points!

But Ultimate Dart Striker

00:11:00.367 --> 00:11:03.467
also benefits from Rocket
Dart's special ability!

00:11:03.467 --> 00:11:05.534
When it attacks
a monster in defense mode,

00:11:05.534 --> 00:11:07.034
and Ultimate Striker's
attack points

00:11:07.034 --> 00:11:08.800
outweigh that
monsters defense points,

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.400
then the difference
hits you as damage!

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.167
Ultimate Dart Striker,

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:17.734

special ability?

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.953
That's easy!

00:17:15.953 --> 00:17:18.653
Whenever it attacks a monster
that's Level five or above,

00:17:18.653 --> 00:17:20.453
the damage gets doubled!

00:17:20.453 --> 00:17:21.920
Correct!

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.253
And all that damage
is heading one way...

00:17:24.253 --> 00:17:26.153
Heading your way, Sylvio!

00:17:26.153 --> 00:17:27.420
Can we talk this over?

00:17:30.553 --> 00:17:32.120
Oh...

00:17:35.987 --> 00:17:38.087
Nice to see our act
is making a splash!

00:17:38.087 --> 00:17:39.420
Time for an encore!

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.353
Take out Rocket Dart Striker!

00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:43.820
And once again...

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.453
the damage is doubled!

00:17:47.853 --> 00:17:49.487
Not... again!

00:17:49.487 --> 00:17:50.487
No...

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:52.420
(groans)

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.120
And now the grand finale,
attack Power Dart Striker!

00:18:01.887 --> 00:18:03.887
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.020
Who wants to see
more double damage!

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.853
(all)
We do!

00:18:11.853 --> 00:18:12.987
Well I vote no!

00:18:12.987 --> 00:18:15.053
I'm outta here!

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:16.887
Ah...

00:18:20.953 --> 00:18:24.520
Yuya, you managed to throw
everything you have at me,

00:18:26.153 --> 00:18:29.820
but unfortunately for you...
I'm still standing!

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.053
You guys...

00:18:31.053 --> 00:18:34.353
I don't think Yuya has
what it takes to win this.

00:18:47.703 --> 00:18:50.937
(Frederick)
I don't think Yuya has
what it takes to win this.

00:18:50.937 --> 00:18:52.670
I'm not worried.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.170
And neither
is Yuya.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.170
He's got a surprise planned.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.203
Yeah, and I bet it's
a real show stopper!

00:18:58.203 --> 00:19:00.303
Mhm, go for it, Yuya!

00:19:00.303 --> 00:19:03.203
Thanks, guys,
but before I continue,

00:19:03.203 --> 00:19:05.970
let me introduce two
important performers...

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:09.337
They're unimportant, not to
mention completely powerless

00:19:09.337 --> 00:19:10.870
and ready to be squashed!

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.203
I've got to admit,

00:19:12.203 --> 00:19:16.137
Turn Toad and Block Spider
aren't too terrifying...

00:19:16.137 --> 00:19:17.603
... if I leave them as they are.

00:19:17.603 --> 00:19:18.737
Excuse me‐‐ Ah!

00:19:18.737 --> 00:19:20.903
I just have to turn
things around.

00:19:20.903 --> 00:19:23.203
And that's where
Turn Toad comes in!

00:19:23.203 --> 00:19:25.203
You ready to flip out?

00:19:25.203 --> 00:19:26.737
Then jump to it!

00:19:26.737 --> 00:19:27.970
May I present,

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:31.103
the amazing
Turn Toad trickeroo!

00:19:35.837 --> 00:19:37.603
How did your Block Spider
suddenly gain

00:19:37.603 --> 00:19:39.737
so many attack points?

00:19:39.737 --> 00:19:42.703
Turn Toad's ability switched
Block Spider to attack mode

00:19:42.703 --> 00:19:44.570
then gave it an attack point
boost that

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.770
equals half its defense points!

00:19:47.803 --> 00:19:49.237
But that isn't fair!

00:19:49.237 --> 00:19:51.437
You've got 1,200 life points

00:19:51.437 --> 00:19:54.537
and Block Spider has the same
number of attack points.

00:19:54.537 --> 00:19:56.837
So, can anyone here
tell me how many points

00:19:56.837 --> 00:20:00.703
Sylvio will have left
if Block Spider attacks him now?

00:20:00.703 --> 00:20:01.903
(Sylvio whining)

00:20:01.903 --> 00:20:04.637
Feel free to chime in, guys!

00:20:04.637 --> 00:20:06.737
(all)
He'll have zero points!

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.137
Okay, let's see
if your math is correct!

00:20:11.137 --> 00:20:12.637
Get set, Block Spider...

00:20:12.637 --> 00:20:14.770
Attack Sylvio directly!

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.837
N‐‐ No...

00:20:25.337 --> 00:20:27.370
(Zuzu)
Way to go, Yuya!

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:43.003
You won the duel, but you're
losing your Pendulum cards!

00:20:43.003 --> 00:20:44.337
Get them, guys!
Yeah!
Yeah!

00:20:44.337 --> 00:20:45.270
Uh.

00:20:46.337 --> 00:20:48.703
(all)
Whoa...

00:20:51.337 --> 00:20:52.870
(boy)
Let that be a lesson!

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.003
Yuya rules and bullies drool!

00:20:55.003 --> 00:20:56.970
Uh, who are you?

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.237
(laughs)

00:20:58.237 --> 00:21:01.303
Someone who was amped
by your sweet skills!

00:21:01.303 --> 00:21:04.703
So, do you study here
at the Leo Institute?

00:21:04.703 --> 00:21:07.237
I was considering it,
but your moves changed my mind.

00:21:07.237 --> 00:21:09.670
I'm making you my duel guru!

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:10.703
(surprised gasps)

00:21:10.703 --> 00:21:11.770
Say what?

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.903
You want me
to teach you dueling?

00:21:13.903 --> 00:21:15.237
Yup!

00:21:15.237 --> 00:21:18.737
If I'm gonna bear down and
learn to duel I wanna have fun!

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:21.170
Your duel wasn't the most
impressive I ever saw,

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.103
but it was the most
duel‐taining!

00:21:23.103 --> 00:21:25.637
How'd you stop n' drop
those guys?

00:21:25.637 --> 00:21:27.670
I just caught 'em by surprise.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:28.637
It was no big deal.

00:21:28.637 --> 00:21:30.870
My name's Sora
by the way!

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:32.637
It's cool to meet you guys!

00:21:32.637 --> 00:21:34.070
(Yuya)
Yeah!

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.803
Great to meet you, too!

00:21:36.803 --> 00:21:39.003
Don't just lay there!

00:21:39.003 --> 00:21:40.870
Get up and take
his Pendulum Cards!

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:41.937
No.

00:21:41.937 --> 00:21:43.437
Leave it be.

00:21:43.437 --> 00:21:44.737
But, Mr. President!

00:21:46.103 --> 00:21:49.103
That kid is starting
to intrigue me.

00:21:49.103 --> 00:21:52.070
Yuya Sakaki...

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:55.470
There may be more to him
than I expected.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.970
