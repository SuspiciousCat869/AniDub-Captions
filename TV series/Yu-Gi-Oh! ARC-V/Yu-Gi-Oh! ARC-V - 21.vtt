And making me happy
is your job now.

<i>So, in your next match,</i>

00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:13.666

How could pendulum summoning
evolve even further?

Oh, don't ask me!
I wouldn't know!

Sure, I used to run

Zuzu's really been
M. I. A. lately.

00:07:55.966 --> 00:07:57.800
I wonder where she is now.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.566

It's his fifth match.

Yeah!

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.300
Edge Imp Sabres,
I knew you'd show up!

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.966
All right, Zuzu,

00:08:42.966 --> 00:08:44.433
I've shown you
everything up to now,

00:08:44.433 --> 00:08:46.200
so you know
what's in my hand.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.133
How would you play
this next move?

00:08:48.133 --> 00:08:49.633
I know what I'd do!

00:08:49.633 --> 00:08:51.800
I'd use the power
of Polymerization

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.600
to fuse Edge Imp Sabres
and Fluffal Bear together.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.633
Exactly!
You're catching on, Zuzu.

00:08:58.633 --> 00:09:02.566
From my hand, I activate
the spell card Polymerization.

00:09:04.433 --> 00:09:05.600
And with it,

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.300
I fuse Edge Imp Sabres
and Fluffal Bear!

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.433
Edge of sharpness
and fury of bear!

00:09:11.433 --> 00:09:14.600
When the two come together,
you had better beware!

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.500
(both)
Fusion summon!

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.600
(Sora)
Frightfur Bear!

00:09:20.933 --> 00:09:24.766
(both)
Now Frightfur Bear attack
with Pummeling Paw!

00:09:24.766 --> 00:09:26.666
(screams, groans)

00:09:28.466 --> 00:09:29.533
(groans)

00:09:29.533 --> 00:09:30.533
Uh‐oh.

00:09:30.533 --> 00:09:32.066
I think I broke my...

00:09:32.066 --> 00:09:33.333
Arigato!
(audience cheering)

00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:35.100
(man)
Excellent form!

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.900
(cheering and applause)

00:09:42.733 --> 00:09:45.133
Well, five down
and one to go.

00:09:45.133 --> 00:09:47.366
This guy wasn't
much competition.

00:09:47.366 --> 00:09:48.933
But even so,

00:09:48.933 --> 00:09:51.366
it's good to know that you're
really starting to understand

00:09:51.366 --> 00:09:53.333
how and when
to fusion summon.

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:54.433
(chuckles)

00:09:54.433 --> 00:09:56.700
From now on,
that's my total focus!

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.766
I have to completely master
fusion summoning

00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:00.600
and use it
in a duel before

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.300
the Junior ARC League
Championship starts!

00:10:05.666 --> 00:10:09.033
That's the only way
I can beat Julia Krystal.

00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:14.766
Hey, Julia, you're not
going to look for him

00:10:14.766 --> 00:10:16.300
again today, are you?

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.566
You know I am!

00:10:17.566 --> 00:10:19.433
I have to find the man
in the black mask

00:10:19.433 --> 00:10:21.033
no matter what it takes

00:10:21.033 --> 00:10:23.666
and ask him
about Professor Marco.

00:10:23.666 --> 00:10:26.666
Okay, but what makes you
so sure he's the right guy?

00:10:26.666 --> 00:10:29.366
You didn't actually see him
Xyz summon, did you?

00:10:29.366 --> 00:10:32.300
That's exactly why I'm going to
find this mystery man

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.300
and duel the truth
out of him!

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.833
You know, that girl's
a real piece of work.

00:10:38.833 --> 00:10:40.966
Don't let her
hear you say that.

00:10:40.966 --> 00:10:43.466
If you do, she might
work you over!

00:10:43.466 --> 00:10:46.066
Well...
she's right about one thing.

00:10:46.066 --> 00:10:47.833
If we don't find
this joker soon,

00:10:47.833 --> 00:10:49.633
there could be big trouble.

00:10:49.633 --> 00:10:51.633
Yeah, rumor has it

00:10:51.633 --> 00:10:54.366
that quite a few of
L. I. D's elite team members

00:10:54.366 --> 00:10:56.433
have been
disappearing recently.

00:10:56.433 --> 00:10:59.300
Which means it won't be long
'til he comes for us, too.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.833
Huh?

00:11:00.833 --> 00:11:02.200
(whimpering)

00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:13.000
Aha, it's you again, huh?
What do you want?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.400
You want me to demolish you
again like I did before,
big brows?

00:11:17.766 --> 00:11:21.066
Gong has come before you,
duelist to duelist,

00:11:21.066 --> 00:11:23.633
to humbly ask... a favor.

00:11:23.633 --> 00:11:25.133
(gasping)

00:11:25.133 --> 00:11:27.300
You got to be
kidding me!

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.400
(thinking)
Time to do some investigating.

00:11:46.833 --> 00:11:48.766
Everything seems normal.

00:11:58.866 --> 00:12:00.366
(gasps)

00:12:05.466 --> 00:12:07.500
What could have done that?

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.066
This was no ARC
system malfunction.

00:12:10.066 --> 00:12:12.866
Someone or something's
not playing by the rules.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.133
(security guard) Hey!
What're you doing here?

00:12:16.133 --> 00:12:18.266
(gasps)

00:12:18.266 --> 00:12:21.333
Did this thing attack
Professor Marco, too?

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.900
(Zuzu) You could've ended
the duel sooner.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.866
The other guy's monster
had 1,500 attack points.

00:12:35.866 --> 00:12:37.166
You used Fluffal Bear,

00:12:37.166 --> 00:12:39.533
but you should've summoned
Fluffal Leo instead

00:12:39.533 --> 00:12:42.733
because it has 100 more attack
points than the other monster!

00:12:42.733 --> 00:12:44.933
I knew Fluffal Leo
could've ended the duel,

00:12:44.933 --> 00:12:47.733
but I wanted show you
how to fusion summon again.

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:51.700
You didn't seem to totally
get it the last time we dueled.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.733
I really understand it now,
and I've practiced a lot

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:57.100
so I can't wait to test
my new and improved skills

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.500
in an actual battle.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.533
Well, sounds like
you're pretty cocky.

00:13:00.533 --> 00:13:02.666
But just because
you're confident

00:13:02.666 --> 00:13:04.833
doesn't mean
you're competent.

00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:08.433
Okay, let's have a duel
and see if you can cut it.

00:13:08.433 --> 00:13:10.700
Okay, you got it!

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.133
(both) Huh?

00:13:12.133 --> 00:13:16.033
Sora, it's Julia.

00:13:16.033 --> 00:13:18.100
I want answers.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.166
What do you two know
about what's going on

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:21.800
in Paradise City?

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.966
What're you
talking about?

00:13:23.966 --> 00:13:26.200
There's been
a series of attacks

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.766
from a mysterious
duelist.

00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:31.400
Attacks?
What kind of attacks?

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.100
The victims are all connected
to the Leo Institute.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.566
But nobody knows what's been
happening to them, or why,

00:13:38.566 --> 00:13:41.500
because they all
disappeared.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.433
They disappeared?

00:13:43.433 --> 00:13:46.366
Yes, every one of them.

00:13:46.366 --> 00:13:48.533
Top team members of L. I. D.

00:13:48.533 --> 00:13:51.566
and Professor Marco, too.

00:13:51.566 --> 00:13:55.333
They were all attacked
and they're all gone.

00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:57.800
And I know who's
behind these attacks,

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.600
and so do you!

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.166
All right,
tell me where he is!

00:14:02.166 --> 00:14:03.966
You must know where he is!

00:14:03.966 --> 00:14:05.933
Where who is?

00:14:05.933 --> 00:14:08.433
The guy in the black mask.

00:14:08.433 --> 00:14:10.766
The one who was with you
last time I saw you!

00:14:10.766 --> 00:14:11.733
(gasps)

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.200
If I'd captured him then,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.133
I could have stopped
all the attacks!

00:14:22.133 --> 00:14:24.233
It was you
who let him get away!

00:14:24.233 --> 00:14:26.466
Julia, I don't know
anything about him!

00:14:26.466 --> 00:14:28.666
Stop with the lies, Zuzu!

00:14:28.666 --> 00:14:30.966
Professor Marco has
always been there for me.

00:14:30.966 --> 00:14:34.000
And I have to make sure
he always will be!

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.566
It's my turn to help him.

00:14:36.566 --> 00:14:38.866
I don't care what it takes!

00:14:38.866 --> 00:14:41.333
I have to find him!

00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:44.000
Tell me where
Professor Marco is!

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.500
I told you, I don't know
anything about this!

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.233
You were with him
at the scene of the first crime

00:14:49.233 --> 00:14:51.166
but you don't know a thing?

00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:53.400
If you're gonna play dumb...

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.000
then I'll have to
duel the truth out of you!

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.400
You don't have anything
to worry about, Zuzu.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.133
You're more than ready
to take her down.

00:15:01.133 --> 00:15:03.433
You can beat her easy,
trust me.

00:15:03.433 --> 00:15:05.000
You want me to accept
her challenge?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.266
Sure.

00:15:06.266 --> 00:15:08.100
Just a minute ago you said
you wanted to try

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.866
your new skills out
in a real battle.

00:15:09.866 --> 00:15:11.666
Well, here's your chance.

00:15:11.666 --> 00:15:14.400
(sighs)

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.300
You can't defeat me.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.133
Don't you remember
how I picked you apart

00:15:18.133 --> 00:15:19.800
the last time we dueled?

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.433
Yeah, but she's not
the same Zuzu she was back then.

00:15:22.433 --> 00:15:24.500
What's so different?

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.233
She's not intimidated by you
like she was before.

00:15:27.233 --> 00:15:30.000
Not since I explained
to her how pathetic

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.133
the Leo Institute's fusion
summon curriculum is.

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:35.300
Ugh, you dirty little...

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.533
You just insulted
Professor Marco

00:15:37.533 --> 00:15:39.466
who taught me
fusion summoning!

00:15:39.466 --> 00:15:41.700
Now you'll pay!

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.333
I'm gonna crush you first,
then her!

00:15:44.333 --> 00:15:46.366
Nah, don't think so,
Jules.

00:15:46.366 --> 00:15:48.166
After you lose to me,

00:15:48.166 --> 00:15:50.633
I doubt you'll have
the guts to duel her.

00:15:50.633 --> 00:15:52.300
I'll show you guts!

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.600
When I'm through,
you'll wish you never messed

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.566
with the Leo Institute!

00:15:55.566 --> 00:15:58.233
You're from the Leo Institute?

00:15:58.233 --> 00:16:00.366
(gasps)

00:16:00.366 --> 00:16:02.166
(Zuzu screaming)

00:16:08.666 --> 00:16:12.000
If you're one of them,
I'll battle you.

00:16:17.266 --> 00:16:18.933
(groans)

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.066
You... it's you.

00:16:33.066 --> 00:16:36.133
You must be the one who's
been attacking everybody.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.100
Let's duel.

00:16:52.133 --> 00:16:54.066
Bring it!

00:16:54.066 --> 00:16:56.033
Shay, no!

00:16:56.033 --> 00:16:59.333
This won't solve anything!

00:16:59.333 --> 00:17:00.600
(all gasp)

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.866
You're wrong!

00:17:01.866 --> 00:17:04.033
She's with the Leo Institute,
Yuto!

00:17:04.033 --> 00:17:06.766
I told you before,

00:17:06.766 --> 00:17:08.300
this isn't
our battlefield!

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.833
You have to trust me.

00:17:09.833 --> 00:17:11.900
This isn't the way
to go about this.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.933
(grunts) You better believe
it's a battlefield!

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:17.566
I have to do this
to get Lulu back!

00:17:17.566 --> 00:17:19.700
And if you're going
to stand in my way,

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.666
then you're my enemy, too!

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:23.533
Kit, Dipper, he's here!

00:17:23.533 --> 00:17:26.066
Get to Building 33
at the harbor right away!

00:17:26.066 --> 00:17:27.900
Wait!
How do you know for sure

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.433
he's the one
you've been looking for?!

00:17:29.433 --> 00:17:31.166
(gasp)

00:17:31.166 --> 00:17:33.333
Lulu!

00:17:33.333 --> 00:17:35.533
How did you‐‐

00:17:35.533 --> 00:17:37.166
Who helped you‐‐

00:17:37.166 --> 00:17:38.833
Did you get away?

00:17:38.833 --> 00:17:41.966
(gasps)
(grunting)

00:17:41.966 --> 00:17:44.500
Lulu...

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.833
Sorry, my friend,
it's not her.

00:17:50.533 --> 00:17:52.633
Get in touch with
the Leo Institute!

00:17:52.633 --> 00:17:55.166
Send every person you can
down here immediately!

00:17:55.166 --> 00:17:57.233
We're on it, Julia!

00:17:57.233 --> 00:17:59.100
Kit's talking to them
right now!

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.433
Yeah, that's right.

00:18:00.433 --> 00:18:02.700
She's in front of
warehouse 33 at the harbor!

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.333
(thinking) Zuzu's really
been stepping it up,

00:18:05.333 --> 00:18:08.300
learning to fusion summon
from Sora and all.

00:18:10.566 --> 00:18:13.433
She's going up
and I'm going nowhere!

00:18:13.433 --> 00:18:15.633
(both groaning)

00:18:15.633 --> 00:18:18.133
Get that
license plate number.

00:18:18.133 --> 00:18:19.433
You!

00:18:19.433 --> 00:18:20.466
Yuya!

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:21.933
Yuya Sakaki!

00:18:21.933 --> 00:18:24.633
You know, a sorry
couldn't hurt, Dipper!

00:18:24.633 --> 00:18:26.866
Why should I apologize
for your clumsiness

00:18:26.866 --> 00:18:28.000
and you bein' in my way?!

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.200
Enough!
We've got an emergency!

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.666
All right, let's go.

00:18:31.666 --> 00:18:33.733
What's the big emergency?

00:18:33.733 --> 00:18:36.000
We found the guy who's
been attacking duelists

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.633
at a warehouse
down by the docks.

00:18:37.633 --> 00:18:38.833
(gasps)

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.033
This card,
it isn't right for you.

00:18:49.033 --> 00:18:50.600
Huh?

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.333
You have a right
to your own opinion.

00:18:52.333 --> 00:18:54.500
But I don't appreciate it
when a stranger

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.000
criticizes a card
I picked for somebody.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.966
And if you have a problem
with my choice of cards,

00:18:59.966 --> 00:19:01.800
I'd be glad to show you
how wrong you are

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.466
and how right I am.

00:19:04.466 --> 00:19:05.333
Sora!

00:19:09.433 --> 00:19:10.833
This is ridiculous!

00:19:10.833 --> 00:19:12.766
Stop it!
Both of you!

00:19:12.766 --> 00:19:15.200
(Dipper) Julia!
(gasps)

00:19:18.933 --> 00:19:20.400
Huh?

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.933
(shudders)

00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:29.400
Huh?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.300
Where is he?

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.000
Yeah, come on,
let me at him!

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
He's gone.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.033
(both gasp)

00:19:39.033 --> 00:19:41.433
Zuzu, are you okay?

00:19:41.433 --> 00:19:45.100
He disappeared... again.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.233
Except there were
two of them this time,

00:19:47.233 --> 00:19:49.133
and one of them said
I was Lulu

00:19:49.133 --> 00:19:50.766
and the other one
said that I wasn't.

00:19:50.766 --> 00:19:53.100
What does it mean?

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.000
I don't know.
I don't understand any of it!

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.266
I don't understand
why my bracelet glows,

00:19:58.266 --> 00:20:02.166
or why people disappear
when you show up!

00:20:02.166 --> 00:20:05.033
Zuzu...
(gasps)

00:20:10.833 --> 00:20:12.266
Your cards,
I'll get 'em.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.533
Here.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.166
(Dipper)
There's the L. I. D. truck!

00:20:22.166 --> 00:20:23.900
(all) Huh?

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.466
He was here!

00:20:25.466 --> 00:20:28.533
He was here
and he just disappeared!

00:20:28.533 --> 00:20:31.633
Looks like things are gonna
get a little sticky here.

00:20:31.633 --> 00:20:34.000
You better go, too.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.500
Okay.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.900
Hey!

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.966
I heard you only have
to win two more duels

00:20:38.966 --> 00:20:41.400
to make it into the Junior
ARC League Championship,

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.300
is that right?
Yeah.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.900
Where'd you hear that?

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.733
Well, you better
get lucky.

00:20:46.733 --> 00:20:48.900
That's the only way
you're ever gonna make it.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.133
Yeah?
Think again!

00:20:52.133 --> 00:20:54.233
I'll show you!

00:20:54.233 --> 00:20:55.933
Zuzu? Sora?

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.866
Huh?

00:21:02.366 --> 00:21:05.233
I guess I didn't
see this one before.

00:21:05.233 --> 00:21:07.133
Must be Zuzu's.

00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:08.966
Polymerization...

00:23:06.633 --> 00:23:09.433
