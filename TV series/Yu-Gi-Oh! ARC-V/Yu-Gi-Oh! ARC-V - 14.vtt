Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.700
(Yuya)
This is one of
the coolest duels

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.333
I've ever been part of.

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.000
I was worried
we'd lose the school,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.366
but even though Declan
can summon

00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.533
three different ways,

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.166
Yuya's Pendulum Summoning
is overpowering!

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.400
I, too, have
enjoyed our duel.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.133
The experience has been
most educational,

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.333
especially when you
showed me what it's like to

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.533
be on the receiving end of

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.966
one of your
Pendulum monster's attacks.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.700
Now I'll return the favor.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.333
I'm going to set
the Pendulum Scale!

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.666
No way!

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:32.833
(all gasping)

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:35.900
Just like you, I can
also Pendulum Summon!

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.600
I thought I was the only one
who had Pendulum cards.

still a lot of work to be done.

does not mess around.

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:51.233
Considering Yuya was
the only one who won,

mess around.

heard what he said.

losers!

00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:16.933

So keep showing us
your Pendulum moves

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:24.866

we'll be ready.

method?

It was Xyz.

Yuya doesn't have the ability
to Xyz Summon, does he?

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.433
What's wrong?

00:14:49.433 --> 00:14:52.300
Are you that upset that
I could Pendulum Summon?

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.633
When other duelists started
Action Dueling,

00:14:54.633 --> 00:14:57.466
your dad didn't freak out
and pout about it.

00:14:57.466 --> 00:14:58.833
He just kept
having a good time.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.766
He wasn't mad?

00:15:02.766 --> 00:15:03.900
Just the opposite.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.166
He was flattered!

00:15:05.166 --> 00:15:07.966
He was happy that others
wanted to learn his style.

00:15:07.966 --> 00:15:10.800
And all his friendly rivalries
made Action Dueling

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.633
into the blockbuster form of
entertainment that it became.

00:15:15.266 --> 00:15:18.633
I greatly admire
your father's exploits.

00:15:18.633 --> 00:15:21.833
Yusho Sakaki made Action Dueling
as popular and exciting

00:15:21.833 --> 00:15:23.433
as it is today.

00:15:23.433 --> 00:15:25.533
He was
a true pioneer.

00:15:25.533 --> 00:15:26.933
Declan said something
like that.

00:15:29.266 --> 00:15:31.933
You can keep feeling
sorry for yourself,

00:15:31.933 --> 00:15:35.633
or you can
set the example.

00:15:35.633 --> 00:15:38.133
Pendulum Dueling
isn't yours.

00:15:38.133 --> 00:15:41.500
But as the duelist who opened
the door to the whole thing,

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.233
you could be the example
for everyone to follow.

00:15:46.666 --> 00:15:48.600
And now
I end my turn.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.633
(all gasping)

00:15:49.633 --> 00:15:50.533
He's not attacking?

00:15:51.866 --> 00:15:54.733
Skip usually has more on
his mind than just winning.

00:15:54.733 --> 00:15:56.333
It's his way.

00:15:56.333 --> 00:15:58.966
Otherwise, he could've
become a big pro himself.

00:15:58.966 --> 00:16:00.200
Really?

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.766
My dad was that good?

00:16:01.766 --> 00:16:03.666
Sometimes
those who can, do.

00:16:03.666 --> 00:16:06.566
But sometimes, those who can
would rather help others do.

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:12.266
And now that the turns over,
Exchanging Notes' effect ends,

00:16:12.266 --> 00:16:14.200
so you get your Magicians
back, Yuya.

00:16:18.266 --> 00:16:21.533
I just realized there's a way
to evolve the Pendulum method!

00:16:21.533 --> 00:16:23.833
(Yuya)
If Declan thinks he can
take Pendulum Summoning

00:16:23.833 --> 00:16:25.900
to the next level,
then I better step up

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.633
and match him draw
for draw!

00:16:27.633 --> 00:16:29.666
My dad wouldn't
feel sorry for himself,

00:16:29.666 --> 00:16:30.733
and I won't either.

00:16:32.066 --> 00:16:33.266
It's showtime!

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.366
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:16:37.366 --> 00:16:39.833
Prepare to experience
the thrills and chills of

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:42.700
Yuya Sakaki's dueltainment
spectacular!

00:16:44.033 --> 00:16:46.000
It's time to
swing into action!

00:16:51.266 --> 00:16:53.199
It's time to
swing into action!

00:16:56.332 --> 00:16:57.332
Woo‐hoo!

00:17:01.932 --> 00:17:02.866
Yes!

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:05.832
I'm activating the hip‐shaking
Action Spell

00:17:05.832 --> 00:17:07.299
Illusion Dance!

00:17:11.999 --> 00:17:13.366
Now every
monster on the field

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.032
dances into defense mode!

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.599
Das is the same card that
the Principle used to

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.299
stop Yuya's
attack earlier.

00:17:24.299 --> 00:17:25.666
So why's
he playing it now?

00:17:25.666 --> 00:17:27.132
The Gutsmasters.

00:17:27.132 --> 00:17:29.066
Their special abilities
are useless

00:17:29.066 --> 00:17:31.299
when the team
is in attack mode.

00:17:31.299 --> 00:17:33.466
♪

00:17:37.999 --> 00:17:39.132
Now for the main event.

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:42.499
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:17:42.499 --> 00:17:44.732
the moment you've
all been waiting for!

00:17:44.732 --> 00:17:46.099
Thatta boy.

00:17:46.099 --> 00:17:47.532
I'll use Stargazer Magician

00:17:47.532 --> 00:17:50.932
and Timegazer Magician to
set the Pendulum Scale!

00:17:50.932 --> 00:17:53.866
I'm taking control of
this duel starting now!

00:18:02.966 --> 00:18:04.666
I'm allowed to
summon monsters

00:18:04.666 --> 00:18:06.866
from Level 2 through Level 7
all at the same time!

00:18:08.232 --> 00:18:09.432
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:18:09.432 --> 00:18:11.266
Carve the arc of
victory!

00:18:13.332 --> 00:18:16.666
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:22.532
Turn up the heat Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:18:23.932 --> 00:18:26.499
Soar to victory,
Performapal Spikeagle!

00:18:27.799 --> 00:18:29.832
Stamp to it, Performapal
Stamp Turtle!

00:18:34.532 --> 00:18:37.566
I'm firing up
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon

00:18:37.566 --> 00:18:38.799
and then activating

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:40.399
Spikeagle's
special ability!

00:18:41.799 --> 00:18:44.232
When Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon
attacks your monster,

00:18:44.232 --> 00:18:45.699
you still take damage

00:18:45.699 --> 00:18:48.266
even if your monster
is in defense mode.

00:18:48.266 --> 00:18:50.099
There's the razzle dazzle!

00:18:50.099 --> 00:18:52.799
And now the spotlight
is on Stamp Turtle!

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.332
Once a turn, he can increase
the Level of every monster

00:18:55.332 --> 00:18:56.599
on the field by 1.

00:19:00.899 --> 00:19:03.066
I play the awesome
Action Spell Illusion Fire

00:19:03.066 --> 00:19:04.366
on my Odd‐Eyes.

00:19:04.366 --> 00:19:06.666
It's time for my Dragon
to turn up the heat!

00:19:08.699 --> 00:19:11.132
The monsters I didn't
select are on the sidelines,

00:19:11.132 --> 00:19:13.966
but Odd‐Eyes gets to attack
in their places.

00:19:13.966 --> 00:19:16.166
So Odd‐Eyes can
attack three times?

00:19:16.166 --> 00:19:17.632
(growling)

00:19:17.632 --> 00:19:18.832
Here we go!

00:19:18.832 --> 00:19:21.666
Odd‐Eyes put out
his Gutsmaster Fire!

00:19:21.666 --> 00:19:23.199
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:19:34.166 --> 00:19:35.266
Amazing!

00:19:35.266 --> 00:19:36.466
It's like a phoenix!

00:19:38.899 --> 00:19:40.066
And guess what?

00:19:40.066 --> 00:19:41.632
Now Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon's

00:19:41.632 --> 00:19:43.499
special ability activates!

00:19:43.499 --> 00:19:46.366
Since your Gutsmater Fire
was at least Level 5

00:19:46.366 --> 00:19:48.199
you get to enjoy
double the damage!

00:19:49.666 --> 00:19:50.999
(beeping)

00:19:50.999 --> 00:19:53.999
Go, Odd‐Eyes, finish off
Gutsmaster Heat!

00:19:53.999 --> 00:19:55.132
(roaring)

00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:02.032
Once again,
double the damage!

00:20:03.532 --> 00:20:04.532
(beeping)

00:20:04.532 --> 00:20:06.999
And now for
the grand finale,

00:20:06.999 --> 00:20:09.266
Odd‐Eyes attacks
Gutsmaster Red!

00:20:16.899 --> 00:20:18.566
Don't forget to
double the damage!

00:20:21.099 --> 00:20:22.932
I have been defeated!

00:20:22.932 --> 00:20:24.232
