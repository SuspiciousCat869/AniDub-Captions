00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.533
(Nico Smiley)
The hunt is on!

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.333
If our challengers want
to duel,

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.133
they must first find
two Pendulum Cards.

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:14.900
Then, they must decide how
many cards to put on the
line.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.766
It's time to set the stage
for our star performers!

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.833
Go...

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:23.666
Quartet of Quandry!

00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.300
It looks like our first duel
in the Volcano zone

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.066
<i>is about to erupt!</i>

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:31.166
It's Taka and Nagi from
the Banded Warrior Academy

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:35.200
versus You Show Duel School's
Yuya Sakaki!

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.900
Duel!
Duel!

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.133
(Nico Smiley)Well, it looks like
things are heating up in the
Iceberg Zone!

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.000
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.766
(Nico Smiley)
And now we've got another pair
of duelists about to mix it up.

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.533
Unless you want
to get flambéed,

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.500
you best get
out of Gong's way!

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.066
I move for
no one.

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.400

What?

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.433
Pardon me.

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:03.533
What is the meaning
of this message?

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:06.933
(Nico Smiley)
They've accidentally
triggered a tag team duel!

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.600
I think it's safe to say
show times over, Taka.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.166
Two on one doesn't
seem like a fair game.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.266
Mind if I
join in?

<i>Intrusion penalty.</i>

2,000 life points.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.666
(screaming)

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:37.966
My, my, my, the surprises
this tournament

00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:39.966
keeps unleashing
is electrifying!

00:02:39.966 --> 00:02:43.700
Especially for Leo Institutes
exchange student Dennis McField,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.233
who found out the hard way
that butting into a duel

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:49.266
can be
quite shocking!

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:50.933
Why was he penalized?

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:53.733
Zuzu didn't lose points when
she crashed Gong's duel.

00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:55.600
(Nico Smiley)
<i>Let me explain.</i>

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.900
Please pay close
attention.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.266
You see, Ms. Boyle
was already dueling,

00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:04.100
so it was deemed she was simply
continuing said duel.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.000
However, Mr. McField wasn't
dueling against anyone

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.366
when he inserted
himself into battle,

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:11.733
which is why he was given
an intrusion penalty.

00:03:14.566 --> 00:03:18.166
I wasn't expecting a jolt like
that, but you've got to admit,

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:19.900
my entrance was...

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.966
truly electrifying.

00:03:21.966 --> 00:03:24.666
Thanks for the save, but
why'd you risk helping me?

00:03:24.666 --> 00:03:27.833
Us dueltainers have
to stick together!

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:29.233
When I saw you
were in trouble,

00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:31.500
I couldn't stand by and
let the curtains fall

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.600
on such an
entertaining duel,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.866
so that's when I sent my Damage
Juggler in to help you out!

00:03:37.866 --> 00:03:41.466
Putting a stop to that menacing
monster was the least I could do

00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:45.400
to say thank you for putting on
such a dramatic performance!

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.133
Well, thanks
for saving me.

00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:51.966
Oh, don't thank me, Yuya,
it was nothing.

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:54.466
Get lost,
you clown!

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:56.300
Such dunderheads.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.733
Dueling and of course winning
with Yuya Sakaki

00:03:58.733 --> 00:04:01.200
is too good of an
opportunity to pass up.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.666
Dennis McField has
turned a two‐on‐one battle

00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:06.066
in the Volcano Zone
into a tag duel!

00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:07.566
And meanwhile,

00:04:07.566 --> 00:04:11.133
in the Iceberg Zone, a brand
new cold war is about to
begin!

00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:16.966
Bundle up, your life points
are about to drop to zero.

00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:20.533
Because, I tune Level 3
Polar Penguin

00:04:20.533 --> 00:04:22.800
with my Level 4
Blizzard Wolf!

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.133
(roaring)

00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:30.833
Do not underestimate
this beast,

00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:34.800
for its ferociousness
will freeze you with fear!

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.933
I Synchro Summon
Glacial Beast Iceberg Narwhal!

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:47.533
And now, Iceberg Narwhal
attack Zuzu directly!

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.166
My Action Spell Blinding
Blizzard will stop that cold!

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:54.666
The icy air must be
numbing your brain!

00:04:54.666 --> 00:04:57.666
You think a little breeze
will slow my Glacial Beast?

00:04:57.666 --> 00:05:00.233
Narwhal, blow away
the blizzard to create

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.566
a path straight for Zuzu!

00:05:02.566 --> 00:05:04.766
It's sno‐ver
for you!

00:05:09.366 --> 00:05:11.466
You are finished
Zuzu Boyle!

00:05:11.466 --> 00:05:15.133
Your spell card's going
good‐bye and snow are you!

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.966
Gong's gonna melt that
plan Princess Permafrost!

00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:25.466
Superheavy Samurai Blowtorch
redirects your Narwhal's attack

00:05:25.466 --> 00:05:27.466
to take the hit in
Zuzu's place!

00:05:27.466 --> 00:05:28.766
Curses!

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:35.666
And you ain't snuffin
out Blowtorch's flames

00:05:35.666 --> 00:05:38.733
cause it can't be destroyed
once per turn!

00:05:38.733 --> 00:05:42.000
But you will still
take the damage fool!

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.500
(screaming)

00:05:45.933 --> 00:05:46.933
Oh no!
Gong!

00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:48.233
I'm just fine Zuzu.

00:05:48.233 --> 00:05:49.900
Don't you worry.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.533
Thanks for having
my back Gong.

00:05:51.533 --> 00:05:53.500
Gong wouldn't
duel any other way.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.333
'Cause we're a team!

00:05:55.333 --> 00:05:57.666
Thanks, it means a lot.

00:05:57.666 --> 00:05:59.333
Would you
look at that!

00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:03.166
Gong's gallant play has saved
his tag teammate Zuzu Boyle!

00:06:03.166 --> 00:06:04.733
It's Gong to
the rescue!

00:06:04.733 --> 00:06:07.266
Way to go Gong
you are so the man!

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:08.433
Totally!

00:06:08.433 --> 00:06:10.433
And I hope Yuya can work
with this new guy

00:06:10.433 --> 00:06:12.366
to turn his
duel around, too.

00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:15.300
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time to take to the stage!

00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:20.833
(Nagi)
Even if you got a partner,
it's too little too late, Yuya!

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:22.666
Don't be so sure!

00:06:22.666 --> 00:06:25.333
The kid's only got
200 life points left.

00:06:25.333 --> 00:06:27.100
One Flame Ball
will end him.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.300
Let's go get one!

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.433
(cackling)

00:06:29.433 --> 00:06:30.833

superstar!

00:08:48.866 --> 00:08:50.066
Magic!

00:08:50.066 --> 00:08:52.266
This kid's a showman
just like Yuya's dad!

00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:55.000
And he's just as cute
as Reed Pepper!

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.033
(Dennis)
When Trapeze Magician's
on stage,

00:08:57.033 --> 00:08:58.766
I don't take
damage from effects

00:08:58.766 --> 00:09:02.533
that are less than or equal
to its attack points.

00:09:02.533 --> 00:09:04.800
So you can stop trying
to use Flame Balls

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.500
to win because I
just extinguished them.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.566
Hope you enjoyed
your front row seats.

00:09:10.566 --> 00:09:12.100
Think I'll bow out now.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.533
I end my turn.

00:09:13.533 --> 00:09:15.066
You're done?

00:09:15.066 --> 00:09:18.766
Yeah because I'd love it if I
could watch you close the show.

00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:19.900
Uh, sure thing

00:09:25.633 --> 00:09:29.166
(Nico Smiley)
Now I direct your attention
to the Ancient Ruins Zone,

00:09:29.166 --> 00:09:31.233
where Shay Obsidian
is pitted against

00:09:31.233 --> 00:09:33.700
three Knights
of the Duel Disk.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.500
Let's see if Shay can fend
off this thrilling triple
threat!

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.633
Have you discovered
Celina's whereabouts?

00:09:39.633 --> 00:09:42.533
No, but we're
working on it, sir.

00:09:42.533 --> 00:09:44.700
She's in the city
watching this.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.733
I'm certain of it.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.533
Raidraptor,
Rise Falcon, attack!

00:09:54.533 --> 00:09:56.933
Ravaging Rebellion!

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.833
(screaming)

00:10:04.766 --> 00:10:10.500
You three aren't worthy
to join The Lancers.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.500
(Gong)
Gong's turn!

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.133
And Gong summons

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:15.233
Superheavy
Samurai Gigagloves!

00:10:19.233 --> 00:10:22.500
Gong can send a Superheavy
Samurai to the graveyard,

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.833
to summon Superheavy
Samurai Trumpeter!

00:10:29.266 --> 00:10:32.300
Now Level 2 Trumpeter
tunes Level 1 Blowtorch

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.700
and Level 3 Gigagloves to
turn up the heat

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.266
and melt away
your life points!

00:10:39.533 --> 00:10:41.100
Do the monster math!

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.533
Tuning these three is gonna make
a monster to settle this score!

00:10:45.533 --> 00:10:47.700
I Synchro Summon!

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:54.200
Level 6 Superheavy Samurai
Ogre Shutendoji!

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.266
My Ogre's
special ability knocks out

00:10:56.266 --> 00:10:59.600
all your spell and
trap cards!

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.266
(gasping)

00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:04.433
Oh, no!

00:11:04.433 --> 00:11:06.400
Since you destroyed
my Absorbing Lamp,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.166
I have to give Zuzu
her Pendulum Card back.

00:11:09.166 --> 00:11:11.500
So here it is once
again yours.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.700
Unfortunately.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.500
All right, now I'm back
in the swing of things!

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.800
And since you also got
rid of my Red Fiend,

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.433
my Fire Djinn's
attack points

00:11:19.433 --> 00:11:23.300
will now drop
back down to 2,400.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.866
Gong's Ogre can use its
defense points to attack

00:11:25.866 --> 00:11:29.733
while it's in defense mode so
say so long to your Fire Djinn!

00:11:36.766 --> 00:11:38.200
All right!

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.533
Awesome!
Great work, Gong.

00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:41.133
Now we're the ones
who're winning!

00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:42.866
(Declan)
Are you
certain of that?

00:11:42.866 --> 00:11:45.933
When my Fire Djinn is destroyed,
I can tribute one monster

00:11:45.933 --> 00:11:48.600
to destroy your
Superheavy Samurai Ogre

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.066
and send it directly
to your graveyard.

00:11:51.066 --> 00:11:54.933
And in addition, you also
take 600 points of damage.

00:11:54.933 --> 00:11:56.133
That's bad!

00:11:56.133 --> 00:11:57.800
So then, I tribute
Purple Lamp

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:03.233
to activate Fire Djinn's
special ability!

00:12:03.233 --> 00:12:04.400
Oh, no!

00:12:10.733 --> 00:12:12.100
No, Gong,
no!

00:12:17.866 --> 00:12:19.166
Gong!

00:12:19.166 --> 00:12:21.833
You should be
worrying about yourself.

00:12:21.833 --> 00:12:24.233
I activate Narwhal's
special ability

00:12:24.233 --> 00:12:26.833
so you take same amount
of damage that Gong did.

00:12:30.866 --> 00:12:31.766
(gasping)

00:12:31.766 --> 00:12:33.666
That's so cold!

00:12:33.666 --> 00:12:35.166
Zuzu!

00:12:35.166 --> 00:12:36.333
(Zuzu)
Are you alright?

00:12:36.333 --> 00:12:38.666
Don't worry about Gong,
worry about winning!

00:12:38.666 --> 00:12:41.100
You gotta duel for
the both of us now!

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.733
The rest is
up to you.

00:12:45.733 --> 00:12:48.966
I understand
and I'll do it!

00:12:48.966 --> 00:12:51.533
I can see your friendship
together will never end

00:12:51.533 --> 00:12:53.333
on the other hand
this duel will.

00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:55.333
You have 200 life points
remaining

00:12:55.333 --> 00:12:57.800
so winning on my next
turn will be quite simple.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.966
Doubt it,

00:12:58.966 --> 00:13:00.933
'cause I've still got a
lot of show left in me

00:13:00.933 --> 00:13:02.533
and here it comes!

00:13:05.433 --> 00:13:06.833
I set the Pendulum Scale

00:13:06.833 --> 00:13:09.833
with Scale 3 Pendulumstatue
White Butterfly

00:13:09.833 --> 00:13:12.766
and Scale 9 Pendulumstatue
White Flower!

00:13:12.766 --> 00:13:14.433
So changes
are in bloom!

00:13:23.366 --> 00:13:26.100
Now I can summon monsters
between Level 4 and 8

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.966
at the same time!

00:13:27.966 --> 00:13:29.700
I Pendulum Summon...

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.233
the lovely
and talented

00:13:32.233 --> 00:13:34.566
Soprano the Melodious
Songstress.

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:39.600
And Mozarta
the Melodious Maestra!

00:13:41.966 --> 00:13:44.266
And I can use Soprano
to Fusion Summon

00:13:44.266 --> 00:13:46.900
without using
Polymerization.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.966
Soprano, this
is your moment!

00:13:48.966 --> 00:13:51.000
Fuse with Mozarta!

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.966
Together you'll sing
a sensational duet

00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:55.933
that will form an
even more melodious monster!

00:13:55.933 --> 00:13:57.500
I Fusion Summon!

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.233
Bloom Diva
the Melodious Choir!

00:14:05.733 --> 00:14:07.066
(singing)

00:14:08.566 --> 00:14:10.400
Let's start on
a high note:

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.666
Bloom Diva,
attack Iceberg Narwhal!

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.300
And here's music
to my ears,

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.100
Bloom Diva can't
be destroyed in battle

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.966
against your Iceberg Narwhal!

00:14:23.966 --> 00:14:25.533
And instead of me
taking damage,

00:14:25.533 --> 00:14:27.733
you take the damage
that I was going to take!

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:29.033
And the icing
on the cake,

00:14:29.033 --> 00:14:31.900
your monster
is also destroyed

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:32.933
Very clever..

00:14:32.933 --> 00:14:34.600
but I will still
have life points left.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.300
I know, but I'm about
to change that!

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.033
Now I activate
Pianissimo!

00:14:40.033 --> 00:14:43.000
Diva's attack points
drop so you take more damage!

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.033
Nyet!
Cannot be!

00:14:45.033 --> 00:14:47.500
Quiet please,
there's a lady on stage!

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.433
Bloom Diva, let's give our
friend here a performance

00:14:49.433 --> 00:14:50.733
she'll never forget.

00:14:50.733 --> 00:14:54.400
Wrecking Refrain!

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.800
(straining)

00:14:57.033 --> 00:14:58.133
Impressive.

00:14:58.133 --> 00:15:00.000
Watching you duel you
has been such an honor.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.966
I am so grateful.

00:15:01.966 --> 00:15:03.566
You won't be
in a second.

00:15:03.566 --> 00:15:06.733
But Zuzu, you do not have a
monster with which to attack,

00:15:06.733 --> 00:15:08.433
so I believe you
are finished.

00:15:08.433 --> 00:15:11.933
Me finished?

00:15:11.933 --> 00:15:13.300
I don't think
so, Halil!

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.000
I activate
De‐Fusion!

00:15:16.733 --> 00:15:19.233
By returning my Bloom Diva
to the Extra Deck,

00:15:19.233 --> 00:15:22.366
I can summon the monsters
that were combined to create it!

00:15:22.366 --> 00:15:24.833
Welcome back Soprano
and Mozarta!

00:15:30.833 --> 00:15:32.166
It's showtime!

00:15:32.166 --> 00:15:34.333
Soprano,
attack Halil!

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.866
Mozarta,
you're on!

00:15:43.833 --> 00:15:46.033
Guess this is
my swan song!

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:54.100
Zuzu Boyle has just won a major,
melodious, vocalist victory,

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.366
which means all four Pendulum
Cards go to the tag team

00:15:57.366 --> 00:15:59.400
of Zuzu and Gong!

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.666
(all three)
They did it!

00:16:00.666 --> 00:16:01.800
All right!

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.600
I'm so fired up my
tears are boiling!

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.500
Take center
stage, Yuya!

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.966
Show em your
dueling dazzle!

00:16:10.966 --> 00:16:12.633
Dazzle?

00:16:12.633 --> 00:16:13.933
Okay!

00:16:13.933 --> 00:16:15.733
It's showtime!

00:16:15.733 --> 00:16:17.333
I draw!

00:16:17.333 --> 00:16:21.233
I set the Pendulum Scale with
Scale 1 Pendulumstatue Red Fiend

00:16:21.233 --> 00:16:24.266
and Scale 7 Pendulumstatue
Red Fairy

00:16:24.266 --> 00:16:26.833
I'm taking control of
this duel starting now!

00:16:35.833 --> 00:16:40.166
I can summon monsters between
Level 2 and 6 at the same time.

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.966
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:16:41.966 --> 00:16:45.666
Carve the arc
of victory!

00:16:45.666 --> 00:16:48.866
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.500
Scratch your way to victory
Performapal Silver Claw,

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.700
Snap to it,
Performapal Whip Snake!

00:17:00.333 --> 00:17:01.266
(Yuya)
Oh, no

00:17:01.266 --> 00:17:02.666
It's happening
again

00:17:02.666 --> 00:17:05.233
What's going on?

00:17:10.366 --> 00:17:13.166
(gasping)

00:17:13.166 --> 00:17:14.633
(Dennis)
Yuya!

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.500
Relax.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.300
I know what's
happening.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.700
You do?

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.233
You're afraid of losing control
like you did in the duel

00:17:28.233 --> 00:17:29.966
against Iggy Arlo.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.200
But don't worry!

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.600
Trapeze Magician and I are
here to keep you focused

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.033
on entertaining the crowd.

00:17:37.033 --> 00:17:40.966
Always remember
use your power

00:17:40.966 --> 00:17:44.100
to keep the world
entertained and smiling.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.100
Thanks, Dennis.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.000
Good to know.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.566
You're quite
welcome.

00:17:51.566 --> 00:17:53.500
Then let's go!

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.966
I overlay my Level 4 Silver Claw
and Level 4 Whip Snake

00:17:56.966 --> 00:17:58.966
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.700
Cloaked in shadows and
relentless in its objective,

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.766
I call upon the most
dangerous of Dragons!

00:18:11.766 --> 00:18:13.733
I Xyz Summon.

00:18:13.733 --> 00:18:15.766
Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon!

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.100
This is the same move you made
when you flipped out on Iggy.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.233
Looks like someone's about
to try and bring the pain!

00:18:30.233 --> 00:18:32.133
You're wrong.

00:18:32.133 --> 00:18:35.900
'Cause I'm about to bring
on the entertainment.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.233
On with the show!

00:18:42.266 --> 00:18:43.700
This'll be...

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.366
hot!

00:18:47.433 --> 00:18:49.900
With Trapeze Magician's
special ability,

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.600
I can use one of its Overlay
Units to allow a monster

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.933
to attack you not once
but twice in a single turn!

00:18:55.933 --> 00:18:59.033
And that monster is going to be
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.333
(roaring)

00:19:03.333 --> 00:19:04.800
Thanks, Dennis!

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.400
Now, here's Dark Rebellion's
special ability!

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.100
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.133
the attack points of your
monster are cut in half, Taka!

00:19:13.133 --> 00:19:15.233
And then
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon

00:19:15.233 --> 00:19:18.033
gains those attack points.

00:19:21.966 --> 00:19:23.600
Fujin!

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.000
You're next,
Nagi!

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.833
I still got an Overlay Unit,
which I'm using on Raijin!

00:19:35.333 --> 00:19:36.533
Time to power up!

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.433
(singing)

00:19:39.433 --> 00:19:42.166
You've got style,
Dennis!

00:19:42.166 --> 00:19:44.000
So do I!

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.166
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon,
attack Fujin!

00:19:49.466 --> 00:19:50.866
(screaming)

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.400
Dark Rebellion,
one more time!

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.566
Now let's attack Raijin!

00:20:03.566 --> 00:20:04.900
Mauling Mandible Charge!

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:10.166
(screaming)

00:20:11.766 --> 00:20:12.966
That's a wrap!

00:20:18.533 --> 00:20:20.033
Bravo, Yuya!

00:20:20.033 --> 00:20:22.033
A triumphant
performance!

00:20:22.033 --> 00:20:23.533
Yeah.

00:20:23.533 --> 00:20:25.966
Dueling's the best
entertainment, for sure!

00:20:25.966 --> 00:20:28.766
I only wish we could hear how
much the audience enjoyed it.

00:20:28.766 --> 00:20:30.333
(everyone cheering)

00:20:30.333 --> 00:20:31.500
Whoa!

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.100
After a comeback
that hot I've gotta cool down!

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.433
That's what entertainment
dueling's about!

00:20:36.433 --> 00:20:38.133
(all three)
All right, Yuya!

00:20:38.133 --> 00:20:39.333
Woohoo!

00:20:39.333 --> 00:20:40.666
Yuya and Zuzu
both won!

00:20:40.666 --> 00:20:41.700
We're two for two!

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.300
It's very exciting

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:47.166
Why it's almost as exciting
as if Reed Pepper won!

00:20:47.166 --> 00:20:51.866

00:20:59.833 --> 00:21:02.533
Nice, I found
a Pendulum Card.

00:21:02.533 --> 00:21:04.233
What gives?

00:21:04.233 --> 00:21:07.066
It's moving on
its own!

00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:08.700
(Trout)
I caught
me a big one!

00:21:11.733 --> 00:21:15.066
That's not funny!

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:16.200
What's
the big idea?

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.400
I'm no catch of
the day.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.866
Now, now don't let
your fins get flustered

00:21:19.866 --> 00:21:22.033
I just fish for sport.

00:21:22.033 --> 00:21:24.133
Something's fishy
about you.

00:21:24.133 --> 00:21:26.133
You look like that
cooking show duelist!

00:21:26.133 --> 00:21:28.500
That's because I am him,
TV's Reed Pepper.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.800
In that case I got something
I wanna talk to you about.

00:21:37.633 --> 00:21:40.566
(Zuzu)
Well, Gong,
here you go.

00:21:40.566 --> 00:21:43.066
You won that
duel, Zuzu.

00:21:43.066 --> 00:21:45.466
Gong cannot
take those cards.

00:21:45.466 --> 00:21:46.533
But it was a
tag duel.

00:21:46.533 --> 00:21:47.866
You deserve
half the cards.

00:21:47.866 --> 00:21:50.766
Gong'll just take back
the card that Gong wagered.

00:21:50.766 --> 00:21:53.733
There's still a lot of
battle left, Zuzu.

00:21:53.733 --> 00:21:54.900
So good luck.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.966
Thanks, Gong.

00:21:55.966 --> 00:21:57.800
Good luck
to you, too.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.933
Thanks for jumping in
to help me, Dennis!

00:21:59.933 --> 00:22:01.200
I should
thank you!

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.166
It's not every day you get
to duel with someone

00:22:03.166 --> 00:22:05.433
who learned from
the great Yusho Sakaki.

00:22:05.433 --> 00:22:06.366
Whoa.

00:22:06.366 --> 00:22:07.800
So you knew
my dad?

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.333
Who doesn't?

00:22:09.333 --> 00:22:11.500
He was like
my dueling hero.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.100
You know it's
funny.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.900
With you, it felt
like he was on my team.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.133
I felt it,
too, Yuya.

00:22:17.133 --> 00:22:18.433
I felt it, too.

00:22:18.433 --> 00:22:21.233
Let's both keep winning
and make it to the end.

00:22:21.233 --> 00:22:22.300
Okay.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.333
Let's do it!
