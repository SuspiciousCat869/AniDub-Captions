(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.700
Mr. President, it appears
someone in the city

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.033
carried out
a highly powerful summon.

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:10.566
Using which method?

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.333
(Chief)
Fusion, sir.

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.666
We obtained this footage
from a security cam.

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.833
(Claude) Dipper.
(Declan)
And it appears he's not alone.

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:20.266
(Claude)
I know her.

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:23.033
That's Zuzu Boyle
from the You Show School.

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:28.866
Hey, backstage
is only for competitors

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.600
still in the tournament.

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.166
You may leave now,
Ravenwood.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.766
Declan?

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.500
(scoffs)
Don't move!

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.066
Get going now.

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.700
(grunts)
Get out of my way.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.333
(Barrett)
Let me take care of him.

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:48.100
The Professor gave me orders
to keep an eye on you.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.133
He said if any flies get in
your way, I should swat 'm down.

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.500
(groans)

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.933
Is the professor you just
referred to named Leo Akaba?

00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.900
Then it seems

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.600
we have a lot more
in common than you realize.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.200
(both)
Let's duel.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.366
King Tell, take aim
at Dark Sentinel.

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.333
Ionic arrow strike.

00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.566
(grunting, groaning)

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.700
Don't be leaving so soon.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.500
I have a tale that
you might want to hear

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.433

you believe in.

So you're Celina...

00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:30.533
not Zuzu Boyle.

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:33.300
Zuzu who?
Never mind.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.100
She's just someone you look
a great deal like.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.200
But that doesn't
need to be

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.166
our topic of
conversation, Celina.

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:42.066
At least not right now.

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:43.500
So what, then?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.033
I thought we'd talk about
what happened years ago.

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:47.833
Or don't you remember?

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:49.333
We've met before.

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:51.200
I am Declan Akaba.
(Barrett groaning)

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.033
Leo Akaba's son.

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:55.966
We encountered each other
in the Fusion dimension.

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:59.933
You were the duelist that my
father saw the most promise in.

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:02.100
And now you're here.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.100
And I'd like
to know why.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.266
Did you finally
become the duelist

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:08.466
my father believed
you would become?

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:10.100
Did he send you here

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.266
as an advance scout for
the impending invasion?

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:15.466
Nobody sent me here.

00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:18.100
I go where I want,
when I want.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.166
I answer to no one.

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:23.566
And I do remember you.

00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:25.133
Three years ago,
right?

00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:27.200
You appeared out of
nowhere at Duel Academy

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.166
and tried to help me.

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:30.733
I won't ever
forget that day.

00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:32.200
But not because of you.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.100
Because that was the day
I decided to make my big escape.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.800
The day I would join the rest of
my classmates on the frontlines.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.266
But it wasn't to be
and all because of your father.

00:03:42.266 --> 00:03:44.700
Hmm. Yes.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.100

Now, be a good girl.
Come with us.

00:04:37.833 --> 00:04:40.633
But I want to join the frontline
with my classmates.

Everyone knows
I'm the most talented duelist

this place has ever seen.

00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:48.300
We both know there's no way
the Professor will permit that.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.066
(Celina)
Then you give me no choice.

00:04:51.066 --> 00:04:52.100
Whoa.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.700
If I can't fight
with the others,

then I'll just
have to fight you guys.

I guess we're doing this
the hard way.

Believe it.

00:05:02.466 --> 00:05:04.900
I summon Lunalight Blue Cat.

00:05:08.633 --> 00:05:10.766
And I'm playing
a facedown, too.

Whoa, there's no action field,

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.533
but this duel
looks and feels so real.

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:40.566
Come on, you're Duel
Academy's best teachers

00:05:40.566 --> 00:05:42.066
and that's all
you can throw at me?

00:05:42.066 --> 00:05:43.300
Duel Academy?

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.733
Very well.

Stop! What gives?

00:06:22.766 --> 00:06:25.133
Why'd you help me
back there?
Uh...

00:06:25.133 --> 00:06:27.666
You're not from
around here, are you?

00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:31.066
Well...
'Cause I'm looking for
a way off this island.

Father?

00:06:45.366 --> 00:06:48.066
My dear,
I admire your spirit,

00:06:48.066 --> 00:06:50.466
but the fact remains
you must stay here.

00:06:50.466 --> 00:06:54.166
But why? You always say
I'm one of your best students.

00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:56.300
Doesn't that mean
I'm ready to fight?

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.400
Do not concern yourself
with what it means.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.600
Then when will I
be ready to fight?

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.900
When it's time to
destroy Xyz? Or Synchro?

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.600
Destroy? Wait, Father,
what does she mean?

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.266
I've heard the rumors,
Professor.

00:07:09.266 --> 00:07:11.800
I know you're about
to launch an all‐out attack

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.466
to invade the Xyz dimension.

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:16.633
And for the last time,
I want to be a part of it.

00:07:17.933 --> 00:07:19.900
Please, I'm begging you.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.633
I'll make you proud.

00:07:21.633 --> 00:07:24.000
That's not the point.
Then what is?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.866
One day soon,
you'll understand, Celina.

00:07:26.866 --> 00:07:28.133
Hold on a second.

00:07:28.133 --> 00:07:30.266
Will someone tell me
what's going on here?

00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:32.166
Father, where am I?

00:07:32.166 --> 00:07:33.633
What's Duel Academy?

00:07:33.633 --> 00:07:35.566
Mother and I haven't
heard a word from you

00:07:35.566 --> 00:07:37.600
since you left
the company.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.833
I deserve an explanation,
so talk.

00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:42.966
What I will say to you
is this‐‐

00:07:42.966 --> 00:07:44.900
you should not have come
to this dimension.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.033
Dimension?
What do you mean?

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:49.533
(Celina and Declan)
Huh?

00:07:49.533 --> 00:07:51.733
(grunts)
Get your hands off me!

00:07:51.733 --> 00:07:53.766
Hey!
(muffled yells)

00:07:53.766 --> 00:07:55.866
No! Stop! Don't!

00:07:55.866 --> 00:07:58.733
Now, then,
I do believe it's time

00:07:58.733 --> 00:08:01.100
that we return you
to your quarters.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.866
But from here on out,

00:08:02.866 --> 00:08:05.133
you'll be under guard
at all times.

00:08:05.133 --> 00:08:06.666
(groaning)

00:08:06.666 --> 00:08:08.133
That is all.

00:08:08.133 --> 00:08:10.166
Let me go! Stop it!

00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:12.300
Unhand me!
(grunting)

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.366
It is time
you leave as well.

00:08:15.366 --> 00:08:17.366
No, first I want answers.

00:08:17.366 --> 00:08:19.600
Where am I? Tell me!

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.200
You're in
the Fusion dimension.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.266
And this is my base
of operations,

00:08:24.266 --> 00:08:26.833
known to my subjects
as Duel Academy.

00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:28.766
Base of operations
for what?

00:08:28.766 --> 00:08:30.700
You'll see in time.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.500
Strap him.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.000
Sir.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.166
Huh?
What are you doing?!

00:08:40.266 --> 00:08:42.500
I've secured
the device, sir.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.433
What is this thing?

00:08:44.433 --> 00:08:47.800
You travelled here by way of
my trans‐dimensional portal,

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.700
not that you knew it
at the time.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.933
Regardless, that portal
has now been closed.

00:08:52.933 --> 00:08:56.433
So consider what you're wearing
a one‐way ticket back home.

00:08:56.433 --> 00:08:59.033
After you use it,
it will self‐destruct.

00:08:59.033 --> 00:09:00.800
Now, excuse me.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.133
I'm a busy man.

00:09:03.133 --> 00:09:05.900
Wait! If I travelled
across dimensions,

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.233
that means you can
cross dimensions as well.

00:09:08.233 --> 00:09:10.833
So then, these invasions
Celina was talking about‐‐

00:09:10.833 --> 00:09:12.933
you're going to invade
other worlds?

00:09:12.933 --> 00:09:15.400
Like a conqueror?
Why would you do that?

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.766
I'm planning to create
one supreme world.

00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:20.566
One supreme world?

00:09:20.566 --> 00:09:23.266
I don't understand.
Father?

00:09:23.266 --> 00:09:25.866
(beeping)
Wait, Father!

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:27.433
No!

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:29.900
Yes, that was
three years ago.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.633
And every day since then,

00:09:31.633 --> 00:09:34.166
I've devoted my life
to one single cause‐‐

00:09:34.166 --> 00:09:36.466
stopping my father plan
to invade other dimensions

00:09:36.466 --> 00:09:38.833
and create
one supreme world.

00:09:38.833 --> 00:09:41.900
This is why I became
President of Leo Corporation.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.666
So I could discover duelist.

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:45.700
Duelist who can help me.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.133
Help me defend our dimension
from Leo Akaba.

00:09:49.133 --> 00:09:51.433
I want you to join me,
Celina.

00:09:51.433 --> 00:09:53.500
Join you?
That's right.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.466
I know you're ready
for the frontlines.

00:09:55.466 --> 00:09:58.366
Together,
we can stop my father.
Save it.

00:09:58.366 --> 00:10:00.666
I'm only here to
hunt down and capture

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:03.633
those who escaped
from the Xyz dimension.

00:10:03.633 --> 00:10:06.000
(Sora)
You have to transport me back

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.966
to the Standard dimension
right away!

00:10:07.966 --> 00:10:11.633
There are fugitives hiding there
who escaped from Xyz!

00:10:11.633 --> 00:10:14.666
Though, I have to admit,
I'm a bit surprised.

00:10:14.666 --> 00:10:17.433
The one I have found
was a big joke.

00:10:17.433 --> 00:10:20.566
I mean, here I am trying to
prove my duel skills to Leo,

00:10:20.566 --> 00:10:22.766
but facing a duelist
from the Xyz dimension

00:10:22.766 --> 00:10:24.733
who posed no challenge
whatsoever.

00:10:24.733 --> 00:10:26.800
It kinda
makes you wonder.

00:10:29.033 --> 00:10:31.700
This is Dipper.
A student at my school.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.100
He's an Xyz user
but he's no fugitive.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.566
Don't lie to me.

00:10:35.566 --> 00:10:38.633
I know that an Xyzian
defeated one of my colleagues.

00:10:38.633 --> 00:10:41.066
Where is he?

00:10:41.066 --> 00:10:43.900
(announcer)
<i>And we have our winner!</i>

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.766
Leo Institute's
Shay Obsidian.

00:10:46.766 --> 00:10:49.033
Showing no mercy
to competition,

00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:51.500
Sir Shalack of the Knight
of the Duel Disk,

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.066
was defeated
in a one‐side victory

00:10:54.066 --> 00:10:56.433
that won't soon
be forgotten!

00:10:58.166 --> 00:11:00.900
I know not of
any Xyz fugitives.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.900
I'm sorry.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.633
Then I must
keep looking.

00:11:04.633 --> 00:11:06.366
And by "looking"
you mean

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:08.800
you'll be stirring up
trouble, no doubt.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.266
And I don't want
trouble in my city.

00:11:12.266 --> 00:11:14.766
Leo Akaba may not have
sent you here,

00:11:14.766 --> 00:11:16.200
but know this‐‐

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.466
if you are not my friend,
you are my enemy.

00:11:19.466 --> 00:11:22.666
I won't let you harm her.
(beeping)

00:11:22.666 --> 00:11:24.400
Huh?

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.433
And I just made sure of it

00:11:26.433 --> 00:11:30.300
by sending Duel Academy
your current locations.

00:11:34.266 --> 00:11:36.900
He's gone back to
the Fusion dimension.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.566
So what happens now?

00:11:38.566 --> 00:11:41.533
Simple‐‐ the Professor doesn't
like me disobeying his orders.

00:11:41.533 --> 00:11:43.966
So he'll send his army
to come here to take me back.

00:11:43.966 --> 00:11:46.766
That just means
I'm on a time limit.

00:11:46.766 --> 00:11:49.966
I just have to take down that
Xyzian before they catch me.

00:11:49.966 --> 00:11:51.833
And then the Professor
has no choice

00:11:51.833 --> 00:11:53.766
but to acknowledge
my skills.

00:11:53.766 --> 00:11:55.633
Time's wasting.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.800
It's me.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.800
Assemble the crew.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.400
(female reporter on TV)
<i>And now in duel news.</i>

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.233
After days of
intense competition,

00:12:15.233 --> 00:12:17.200
the Junior Division of
the ARC League Championship

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.033
has concluded
its second round.

00:12:19.033 --> 00:12:21.600
There are now just 16
duelist that remain.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.566
And you better believe
we'll be seeing their best

00:12:23.566 --> 00:12:25.533
as they battle it out
for the top prize.

00:12:25.533 --> 00:12:27.366
Now, let's meet them,
shall we?

00:12:27.366 --> 00:12:29.466
Yeah! Here we go!

00:12:29.466 --> 00:12:33.233
First up is Zuzu Boyle
from the You Show Duel School.

00:12:34.533 --> 00:12:35.833
Yeah!

00:12:35.833 --> 00:12:37.333
Zuzu,

00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:40.800
my pride and joy!

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.466
Let's hear it for Zuzu!

00:12:42.466 --> 00:12:43.800
Let's get loud!

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.066
(Zuzu)
I'm hitting the mute button.

00:12:46.066 --> 00:12:49.000
Next up, also from
the You Show Duel School,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.800
an up‐and‐coming
dueltainer

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.100
who came up with
a new duel strategy‐‐

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.200
Pendulum Summoning‐‐
Yuya Sasaki.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.866
So far in this
tournament,

00:12:57.866 --> 00:13:01.233
we've seen Yuya defeat Sylvio
Sawatari of the Leo
Institute

00:13:01.233 --> 00:13:04.166
and Iggy Arlo of
the Banded Warrior Academy

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:05.666
<i>in a hard fought battle</i>

00:13:05.666 --> 00:13:08.466
that seemed to turn
a bit ugly at the end!

00:13:08.466 --> 00:13:09.700
(thinking)
It sure did.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.300
And that's not how
I like to duel.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.133
Dueling is supposed to be about
putting on a good show.

00:13:14.133 --> 00:13:15.600
Not showing someone up.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.566
I just hope the remaining
duelist feel the same way.

00:13:18.566 --> 00:13:19.866
Huh?

00:13:19.866 --> 00:13:22.400
Just wanted to say
congrats, Yuya.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.033
I know that we're
officially rivals,

00:13:25.033 --> 00:13:26.200
but whatever happens,

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.300
let's remember that
we're also friends.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.666
Right.

00:13:29.666 --> 00:13:32.533
I just hope that you're not
my next opponent.

00:13:32.533 --> 00:13:34.900
After all,
I saw your last duel.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.633
You sure got skills.

00:13:36.633 --> 00:13:38.300
I wish you luck, Zuzu.

00:13:42.566 --> 00:13:46.733
Oh! What sportsmanship!

00:13:46.733 --> 00:13:48.800
Yeah, well‐done, Yuya.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.033
Just like I taught ya.

00:13:51.033 --> 00:13:53.100
You'd think he made the cut.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.133
I wish he'd cut back
on the caffeine.

00:13:56.133 --> 00:13:57.933
(female reporter)
And addition to the
three duelist

00:13:57.933 --> 00:13:59.966
from the Knights of
the Duel Disc Duel School,

00:13:59.966 --> 00:14:02.000
the kitchen king,
Reed Pepper,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.433
<i>is advancing as well!</i>

00:14:04.433 --> 00:14:05.766
All right,
Reed Pepper!

00:14:05.766 --> 00:14:07.833
Hot stuff!
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

00:14:07.833 --> 00:14:09.500
Hot? What do you mean?

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.300
I really hope
she means his cooking.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.033
(female reporter) Next on
the list we have Trout.

00:14:15.033 --> 00:14:18.133
And you know he's hoping
to reel in a win.

00:14:18.133 --> 00:14:21.666
But he'll have some
real competition.

00:14:21.666 --> 00:14:23.633
Because next up
is Gong Strong

00:14:23.633 --> 00:14:25.933
of Paradise City's
prestigious Duel Dojo,

00:14:25.933 --> 00:14:28.233
who some say
is head and shoulders above

00:14:28.233 --> 00:14:29.933
every other duelist
in the tournament!

00:14:29.933 --> 00:14:31.566
But that's mostly because
he happens to have

00:14:31.566 --> 00:14:33.166
a two‐foot tall
pompadour‐‐‐

00:14:33.166 --> 00:14:35.633
three‐feet when it's not
too humid out! (chuckling)

00:14:35.633 --> 00:14:38.666
But moving on‐‐ yet another
duelist from the Leo
Institute,

00:14:38.666 --> 00:14:40.833
Shay Obsidian!
Shay's in?

00:14:40.833 --> 00:14:44.133
Shay has been one of
the most exciting duelists
in the tournament,

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:46.933
defeating You Show Duel
School's Sora Perse

00:14:46.933 --> 00:14:48.966
in a fierce
first round match up.

00:14:48.966 --> 00:14:51.000
Then winning by
an overwhelming margin

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.466
in the second
round of play.

00:14:52.466 --> 00:14:55.666
It will be exciting to see
just what Shay shows us
next!

00:14:55.666 --> 00:14:57.133
<i>Stay tuned.</i>

00:14:57.133 --> 00:14:58.233
Exciting?!

00:14:58.233 --> 00:15:00.366
More like worrisome
if you ask me.

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:02.000
Yeah, I'm with you, Tate.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.300
I don't trust Shay.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.800
Yeah, not since
Sora vanished.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.266
Sora...

00:15:08.266 --> 00:15:12.133
(Leo)
I'm told that you want to go
back to the Standard dimension.

00:15:12.133 --> 00:15:14.933
(Sora)
Yeah, there are
Xyz fugitives there.

00:15:14.933 --> 00:15:16.766
I want to capture them.

00:15:16.766 --> 00:15:19.933
Good.
See to it, then, Sora.

00:15:19.933 --> 00:15:21.900
Thank you. I will.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.266
But first, I want you
to go find somebody else

00:15:25.266 --> 00:15:27.600
with the help
of some friends.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.566
Huh?

00:15:30.566 --> 00:15:32.400
The Obelisk Force.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.466
You are to locate
a young girl.

00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:36.400
This is your top‐priority.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.200
And this is the girl
you must find.

00:15:40.333 --> 00:15:42.000
Zuzu?!

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.666
(Leo)
No, her name is Celina.

00:15:45.666 --> 00:15:47.200
Celina?

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.366
Wait, but how?

00:15:48.366 --> 00:15:50.300
She looks just like Zuzu.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.966
What gives?

00:15:51.966 --> 00:15:54.800
For now,
that's none of your concern.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.866
What is of your concern

00:15:56.866 --> 00:15:59.333
is that you bring
this girl back to me

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:02.033
by whatever means necessary.

00:16:02.033 --> 00:16:04.166
And that includes
taking down

00:16:04.166 --> 00:16:05.766
anyone who gets in your way

00:16:05.766 --> 00:16:09.300
by unleashing the full power
of your duel skills.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.233
This is your mission, Sora.

00:16:12.233 --> 00:16:15.800
Listen, everybody, we all
need a vacay now and then.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.433
When Sora's back, we'll
welcome him with open arms.

00:16:18.433 --> 00:16:20.233
Right, Dad.

00:16:20.233 --> 00:16:21.900
Sounds like a plan.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.300
He'll be so pleased to know
that you two advanced.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.466
Your dueling
inspires us all.

00:16:26.466 --> 00:16:28.433
So you both
just keep on winning

00:16:28.433 --> 00:16:30.633
and I'm sure everything
will be fine.

00:16:30.633 --> 00:16:31.933
Yeah, that's right.

00:16:31.933 --> 00:16:33.766
'Cause wherever Sora is,

00:16:33.766 --> 00:16:35.966
he's watching
just like this.

00:16:35.966 --> 00:16:38.566
That is my Sora impression.

00:16:38.566 --> 00:16:41.733
Needs some work, Frederick, but
I think we all get your point.

00:16:41.733 --> 00:16:43.233
And don't forget,

00:16:43.233 --> 00:16:45.700
Tate here is still competing
in the Youth Division!

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.300
For sure.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.033
So then, all three of you,

00:16:49.033 --> 00:16:51.600
just keep on doing
your very best.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.333
And we'll hope for the best
for Sora, right?

00:16:54.333 --> 00:16:57.066
Sora? Never mind Sora
or anyone else.

00:16:57.066 --> 00:16:59.400
I'm rooting for
Reed Pepper to win.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.800
Gee, thanks, Mom.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.500
<i>So there you have it.</i>

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.100
The duelist who will be
battling it out

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.866
in round three
of the tournament.

00:17:06.866 --> 00:17:09.166
Now it's time to see who
will play their cards right

00:17:09.166 --> 00:17:11.433
and have a shot at
winning the whole thing.

00:17:11.433 --> 00:17:13.733
And now for a look
at tomorrow's weather.

00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:16.100
An interesting group.

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.566
Indeed.
All fine duelist.

00:17:18.566 --> 00:17:21.866
But we need duelist
who are more than just fine.

00:17:21.866 --> 00:17:23.100
Much more.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
(crowd cheering)

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.700
(announcer)
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the third round

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.066
of the ARC‐V
Championship!

00:17:44.066 --> 00:17:47.166
Here are your 16
remaining duelist.

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:49.100
I think that
he means 15.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.100
Yeah, Shay's nowhere
to be found.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:58.266
<i>Now, let's get started!</i>

00:17:58.266 --> 00:18:00.333
But not how
you all might think

00:18:00.333 --> 00:18:03.666
because these competitors
won'tbe dueling here at the
stadium,

00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:05.966
they'll be dueling
throughout the whole city.

00:18:05.966 --> 00:18:07.166
(both)
What?!

00:18:07.166 --> 00:18:08.266
Huh?

00:18:08.266 --> 00:18:11.400
(all)
Huh? So how will that work?

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.033
Well‐done, Declan.

00:18:13.033 --> 00:18:15.966
By announcing duels will be
taking place around the city,

00:18:15.966 --> 00:18:18.000
the public won't know
the difference between

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.333
tournament duels and battles
against Leo's forces.

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:23.866
Right. Which means
there won't be a panic.

00:18:23.866 --> 00:18:25.766
Although our enemy
may panic

00:18:25.766 --> 00:18:28.466
once they realize what
we have in store for them.

00:18:28.466 --> 00:18:31.466
After all, just because
we're the ones being attacked,

00:18:31.466 --> 00:18:33.766
it doesn't mean
we can't fight back.

00:18:33.766 --> 00:18:35.666
And fight back we shall.

00:18:35.666 --> 00:18:38.133
Because while our
16 junior duelist

00:18:38.133 --> 00:18:39.500
fight it out
in the city,

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.366
the eight finalist
in the Senior Division

00:18:41.366 --> 00:18:43.333
will fight off
our invaders.

00:18:43.333 --> 00:18:45.566
The fate of our world
is at stake.

00:18:45.566 --> 00:18:47.900
We will need nothing short
of your very best.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.300
Do you understand?

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.466
(all)
Yes.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.433
(Declan)
Shay, you have
a different mission.

00:18:55.433 --> 00:18:57.466
A very important one.

00:18:57.466 --> 00:18:59.966
You are to continue
taking part in the tournament

00:18:59.966 --> 00:19:02.166
and determine if any of
the other finalists

00:19:02.166 --> 00:19:04.266
have the skills, courage,
and determination

00:19:04.266 --> 00:19:05.800
to become one
of the Lancers.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.400
That sounds like
a complete waste of my time.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.033
Let me handle it.

00:19:10.033 --> 00:19:12.833
I'll take down every one
of those Fusion freaks

00:19:12.833 --> 00:19:14.266
all by myself.

00:19:14.266 --> 00:19:16.966
Hey, remember your place,
you Junior Division punk.

00:19:16.966 --> 00:19:19.300
Whatever.
I'll be a team player...

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.466
for now.

00:19:21.466 --> 00:19:24.100
I hope you're ready,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.733
Because the moment
the clock strikes 12,

00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:28.666
the action will begin
and our duelist

00:19:28.666 --> 00:19:31.000
will all need
to begin searching.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.633
Searching for
what, you ask?

00:19:32.633 --> 00:19:35.100
Pendulum Cards hidden
all throughout the city,

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.366
brand‐new ones created by
the Leo Corporation

00:19:37.366 --> 00:19:38.666
<i>for this tournament.</i>

00:19:38.666 --> 00:19:39.766
Say what?!

00:19:39.766 --> 00:19:41.733
<i>In order to begin a duel,</i>

00:19:41.733 --> 00:19:44.100
our 16 competitors
will each need to find

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.800
at least two of
these cards.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.266
So we'll all have
Pendulum Cards?

00:19:48.266 --> 00:19:50.433
But then that would mean
that everyone

00:19:50.433 --> 00:19:52.200
will be able to
Pendulum Summon.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.300
(announcer)
Furthermore,
over the next 24 hours,

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.333
all of the matches
will be upping the ante

00:19:56.333 --> 00:19:58.700
with Pendulum Cards
as the ante.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.200
After deciding how many
Pendulum Cards to wager,

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.233
you and your opponent
will duel.

00:20:03.233 --> 00:20:05.233
Whoever wins
gets the Pendulum Cards

00:20:05.233 --> 00:20:06.766
that were put
on the line.

00:20:06.766 --> 00:20:08.833
But you won't be having
to wait in line to duel

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:11.166
because the action field
Quartet of Quandary

00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:12.666
<i>will be in effect.</i>

00:20:12.666 --> 00:20:14.700
Separating the city
into four, count them,

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.000
four different zones
for your dueling pleasure.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.966
This is sounding
really good.

00:20:18.966 --> 00:20:20.233

Totally!

00:20:20.233 --> 00:20:23.066
