Previously
on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:06.966
He's Clarity Prep's
star student

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.333
and smartest kid on Earth,

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.166
the one and only
Pierre L'Supérieure,

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.700
Quiz Whiz Extraordinaire!

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.033
Nice to meet you!

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:16.633
When it comes
to the world of trivia,

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:19.466
Pierre has a perfect command
of facts and figures.

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.300
They are all
stored up here.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.933
In a brain that makes yours
look puny by comparison.

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:29.800
You will face off
in the Action Field Quiz Quest!

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.733
Duel!
Duel!

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.700
(computer voice)
Action Trap!

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.100
The category is Science
for 300.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.800
Observe‐‐ there are
300 kilograms of steel

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.700
and 300 kilograms of cotton.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.066
Question‐‐
which is heavier?

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.700
That's gotta be
a trick question,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.600
so the answer's cotton.
(buzzer)

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.233
(Quiz Master)
Wrong, they both weigh the same.

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:49.166
(screaming)

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:52.133
If you found the Quiz Quest
challenging,

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.000
then your brain
should quiver with dread

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.100
as you enter the next phase
of our battle!

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.666
Quiz Quest, Extra Stage!

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.700
Prepare to be
flambéed!

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.300

Gong must get stronger!

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:20.000
(Pierre)
Hope you're ready for
the ride of your life!

00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:24.900
What're we doing
on here?

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:30.000
(laughing)
It is a Quiz Coaster.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.466
As you will soon discover,

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:33.166
this ride is full of twists
and turns

00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:35.733
that will leave
your puny brain reeling!

00:02:35.733 --> 00:02:37.500
(laughs maniacally)

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.400
Pierre sure knows how
to slip up his opponents.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.666
And that's what makes him
Clarity Prep's top banana!

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:47.966
Put on your thinking cap!

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:50.866
This tricky track leads to five
different Action Traps.

00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:55.600
You mean to tell me I've gotta
answer more quiz questions?

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.000
<i>Oui!</i>

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.833
Get the answer right and you
will earn 100 life points!

00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:01.500
But you will surely
be wrong

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.300
and lose 100 life points
instead!

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.300
Either way you are sunk!

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.033
<i>Au revoir!</i>

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:09.400
What's he mean, I'm sunk?

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.866
(screams)

00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:13.833
(groans)

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:15.100
Here it comes!

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.400
The first Action Trap!

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.733
(all)
Watch out!

00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:20.266
Whoa!

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.600
(Quiz Master)
Action Trap activates now!

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.866
Huh?

00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:26.366
The quiz category is dueling.

00:03:26.366 --> 00:03:29.166
You're gonna ask me
dueling questions?

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:30.800
That's right up my alley!

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.733
Finally a category that
he knows something about!

00:03:33.733 --> 00:03:34.766
<i>Ja!</i>

00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:36.566
Question!

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:37.800
Can you spot the difference

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.333
in the two Raigeki Break cards
on display?

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:42.233
You have five seconds
to answer.

00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:44.100
So there's a difference?

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.433
Okay,
let me think.

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:47.933
There's so much
to look at.

00:03:47.933 --> 00:03:49.666
I think it's...

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:50.833
(buzzer)

00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:52.200
Sorry.
Time's up.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.166
The difference is the number
of fingers being held up.

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:57.533
That's what
I was gonna say!

00:03:57.533 --> 00:04:01.066
Your failure to answer will
cost you 100 life points.

00:04:01.066 --> 00:04:02.933
(screaming)

00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:05.566
Whoa, what a shocking
twist!

00:04:05.566 --> 00:04:06.933
Question.

00:04:06.933 --> 00:04:09.900
How many teeth does
a Pot of Greed card show?

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.000
(snickering)
Twenty!

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.033
(bell dinging)
Correct.

00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:16.366
There are 20 teeth
shown on the card.

00:04:16.366 --> 00:04:21.033
Since you were right,
you earn 100 life points!

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:24.100
I better get my act together
or I'm toast.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.500
Pierre!

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.800
Next, I'm summoning!
What?

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.066
Another trap already?

00:04:30.066 --> 00:04:31.633
Question!

00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:33.333
How many human figures appear

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:35.966
in the illustration
on a Heavy Storm card?

00:04:35.966 --> 00:04:37.466
You have five seconds.

00:04:37.466 --> 00:04:40.166
(chuckles)
At last, an easy question!

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:41.333
There's two!

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:43.200
Two people are pictured
on the card!

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.433
(buzzer)

00:04:44.433 --> 00:04:46.700
Incorrect!
There are three figures.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.933
Uh... no way!

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:50.500
(Quiz Master)
Yes way!

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.900
One...

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.266
two...

00:04:53.266 --> 00:04:56.633
and here is figure three.

00:04:56.633 --> 00:04:59.633
That third guy wasn't there
a second ago!

00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:00.900
Yes, he was.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.633
And you lose
100 more points.

00:05:02.633 --> 00:05:03.866
Whoa!

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.233
(screaming)

00:05:08.233 --> 00:05:10.400
Oh, dear!

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.100
(laughter and chatter)

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.366
(girl)
What a numbskull.

00:05:14.366 --> 00:05:15.833
(man)
Throw in the towel!

00:05:15.833 --> 00:05:18.333
I don't see
what's so amusing.

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:19.333
(buzzer)

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:20.700
(Quiz Master)
Wrong again!

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.266
(giggling)

00:05:22.266 --> 00:05:23.433
(buzzer)

00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:24.833
(Quiz Master)
Not even close.

00:05:24.833 --> 00:05:26.300
Here's mud in your eye.

00:05:28.633 --> 00:05:29.866
(buzzer)

00:05:29.866 --> 00:05:31.700
(Quiz Master)
You were "snow" wrong.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.266
(all sighing)

00:05:36.266 --> 00:05:37.633
One!

00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:39.800
(bell dinging)

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.966
(Quiz Master)
Correct.

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:42.266
That is two in a row.

00:05:42.266 --> 00:05:45.066
(snickering)

00:05:45.066 --> 00:05:47.366
(Pierre)
Oh, please, it's that one.

00:05:47.366 --> 00:05:48.366
(Quiz Master)
Correct.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.433
(bell dinging)
Correct again.

00:05:53.433 --> 00:05:55.733
Who is the greatest genius?

00:05:55.733 --> 00:05:57.833
(all)
The answer is...

00:05:57.833 --> 00:06:00.566
Pierre!

00:06:00.566 --> 00:06:02.400
I am coasting to victory!

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.133
I am coasting to victory!

00:06:09.133 --> 00:06:10.966
(crowd cheering)

00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:15.200
Come on, Yuya!

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.600
He better turn up
the heat

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.166
or Pierre will ice
this whole duel!

00:06:18.166 --> 00:06:19.966
(Tate)
It looks hopeless.

00:06:19.966 --> 00:06:22.000
Let's face it, the difference
in their life points

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.900
is humongous now!

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.700
(laughs maniacally)
You were warned!

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.600
I am far too brilliant
to be defeated by you!

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.233
It is like an ant trying
to take down an elephant!

00:06:32.233 --> 00:06:34.433
My intellect is
highly refined,

00:06:34.433 --> 00:06:37.466
while you are nothing
but an uncultured clown!

00:06:37.466 --> 00:06:39.300
(crowd)
A clown!

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.800
(chatter and laughter)

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.600
(sneezes)

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.833
(man)
<i>Gesundheit!</i>

00:06:45.833 --> 00:06:47.900
(giggles)
You truly are a clown!

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.300
(groans, then sneezes)

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.966
(crowd laughing)

00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:57.066
Huh?
They think...

00:06:57.066 --> 00:06:58.866
...he's funny!

00:06:58.866 --> 00:07:02.733
(applause)
(chuckles)

00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:04.200
Thank you!

00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:08.833
Ugh.
This cannot be!

00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:11.700
My command of trivia is far
more entertaining

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.000
than the antics of this
pathetic excuse for a duelist,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.200
and anyone who disagrees
is wrong!

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.533
Okay!
Now on with the show!

00:07:19.533 --> 00:07:20.900
To kick off the next act,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.066
I activate this spell
Performapal Recasting!

00:07:25.066 --> 00:07:27.933
Five of my Performapals will now
leave from my hand

00:07:27.933 --> 00:07:29.666
and shuffle back to my deck!

00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:35.500
Now I can draw five other cards,
plus an extra one for luck!

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.100
Yes!
I caught a break!

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.600
Please watch on in wonder,
my friends,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.700
as I use my newly‐drawn
Magicians,

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.433
Stagazer and Timegazer,
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.933
I can summon monsters
from Level 2 through seven

00:08:01.933 --> 00:08:03.466
all at the same time!

00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:05.700
Swing far,
Pendulum!

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.866
Carve the arc of victory!

00:08:09.433 --> 00:08:13.600
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:08:16.533 --> 00:08:19.533
Flip to it,
Performapal Lizardraw!

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:21.600
Snap to it, Whip Snake!

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.466
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:08:26.733 --> 00:08:29.966
Three at once!
That's extraordinary!

00:08:32.666 --> 00:08:34.833
Heh.
I'm not impressed.

00:08:34.833 --> 00:08:38.333
(Tate)
With three monsters,
Yuya can pummel Pierre!

00:08:38.333 --> 00:08:41.133
(Frederick)
Nien, remember,
Pierre still has Quiz Monkey

00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:43.933
and his tricky trap
Not So Fast!

00:08:43.933 --> 00:08:46.933
So no matter what Yuya does,
Pierre can work his cards

00:08:46.933 --> 00:08:49.933
so that Yuya won't know
if he's going to save
his Monkey or not!

00:08:49.933 --> 00:08:51.933
No, he'll be fine.

00:08:51.933 --> 00:08:53.500
(both gasp)

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.000
Pierre can only use the effect
of Not So Fast once per turn.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.966
But Yuya has three Monsters
set to attack.

00:08:59.966 --> 00:09:01.733
Pierre can block him once,

00:09:01.733 --> 00:09:03.766
but Yuya will still have
enough firepower left

00:09:03.766 --> 00:09:06.233
to take out all
of Pierre's Quiz monsters!

00:09:06.233 --> 00:09:07.366
(both gasp)

00:09:07.366 --> 00:09:10.800
Give it all you've got,
Go Whip Snake!

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.366
Strike at Quiz Monkey!

00:09:12.366 --> 00:09:14.900
Quiz Monkey will use
its special ability!

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.600
My chimp will make a chump
out of you again

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.833
by forcing you to answer
one question correctly

00:09:19.833 --> 00:09:22.066
before your Snake continues
its attack!

00:09:22.066 --> 00:09:23.333
I'm ready!

00:09:23.333 --> 00:09:26.700
Question‐‐ when this battle
is finally over,

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.800
how many surviving
Quiz monsters will be
left on the field?

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.000
I'm sure I have it right
this time!

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.566
The answer is...

00:09:33.566 --> 00:09:34.666
zero!

00:09:34.666 --> 00:09:36.233
Okay, Whip Snake!

00:09:36.233 --> 00:09:38.200
Send Quiz Monkey packin'!

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.666
My Monkey isn't
going anywhere!

00:09:41.666 --> 00:09:45.400
Quiz Sphinx will use
its special ability!

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.100
(laughs)

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.033
Once per turn, when a Quiz
monster comes under attack,

00:09:50.033 --> 00:09:53.700
you must answer
Quiz Sphinx's question!

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.000
What?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.266
I don't even get this many
quizzes in school!

00:09:58.266 --> 00:10:01.400
I can assure you this question
is child's play.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.100
Answer me this‐‐

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.966
which of the monsters
on the battlefield

00:10:05.966 --> 00:10:07.433
has the highest Level?

00:10:07.433 --> 00:10:09.100
Whoa.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.766
If your answer is correct,

00:10:10.766 --> 00:10:12.333
that monster
will be destroyed

00:10:12.333 --> 00:10:13.933
and the duelist
controlling it

00:10:13.933 --> 00:10:17.733
will take its attack points
as damage!

00:10:17.733 --> 00:10:21.700
But if you are incorrect,
then the battle isfini.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.033
Easy breezy!

00:10:23.033 --> 00:10:25.233
Yuya's Odd‐Eyes is Level 7

00:10:25.233 --> 00:10:28.100
so it is zee top
monster‐miester on zah field!

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.366
He's finally going to get
a question right!

00:10:30.366 --> 00:10:31.933
Which is bad,
Frederick!

00:10:31.933 --> 00:10:33.166
But why?

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:34.866
Weren't you
listening?

00:10:34.866 --> 00:10:36.566
If Yuya gives
the right answer,

00:10:36.566 --> 00:10:38.533
then Odd‐Eyes
gets destroyed

00:10:38.533 --> 00:10:43.066
and he'll also get slammed
with 2,500 points of damage!

00:10:43.066 --> 00:10:45.600
Which means Pierre will
chalk up another win!

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.666
(whimpers)

00:10:46.666 --> 00:10:48.533
Ugh,
I can't believe this!

00:10:48.533 --> 00:10:50.866
The only way I can
possibly survive

00:10:50.866 --> 00:10:52.800
is to give the wrong answer.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.966
(Pierre)
Time's up!

00:10:53.966 --> 00:10:56.866
You must give
your answer now!

00:10:56.866 --> 00:11:00.200
I will be thrilled if you are
correct for a change!

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.566
Well?
I'm waiting!

00:11:02.566 --> 00:11:04.833
(laughs maniacally)

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.066
No more stalling!

00:11:12.066 --> 00:11:14.000
Tell me which monster
on the field

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.166
has the highest Level, Yuya!

00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:19.066
If you're right,
you lose the duel!

00:11:19.066 --> 00:11:21.400
It's...

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.966
It's Quiz Monkey.

00:11:24.333 --> 00:11:26.666
Ha!
(laughs hysterically)

00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:29.766
You're totally wrong!
But you had no choice!

00:11:29.766 --> 00:11:31.000
Poor Yuya!

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.033
Due to your failure,
Whip Snake can't attack,

00:11:34.033 --> 00:11:36.733
and your turn is now over!

00:11:36.733 --> 00:11:38.566
When you answered
Quiz Monkey's question,

00:11:38.566 --> 00:11:40.666
you said there would be
no Quiz Monsters left

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:42.366
on the field
after our battle.

00:11:42.366 --> 00:11:45.000
Let's see, our battle
has ended.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.366
But alas for you,

00:11:46.366 --> 00:11:49.433
it appears there are still two
Quiz Monsters on my field!

00:11:49.433 --> 00:11:52.666
I'm afraid once again,
you were completely wrong!

00:11:52.666 --> 00:11:54.366
Your failure will be costly,

00:11:54.366 --> 00:11:57.200
because I can now choose one
of your monsters to strike down!

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.200
(laughs hysterically)

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.833
Watch closely
as I eliminate...

00:12:00.833 --> 00:12:02.800
your Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.933
Who would've thunk
an itty‐bitty Monkey

00:12:08.933 --> 00:12:10.766
could make a Dragon
go kerplunk?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.833
And to add insult to injury,

00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:16.500
Quiz Monkey's
attack points rise

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.900
to the same amount
as your Odd‐Eyes!

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.300
(cheers)

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.866
At least you didn't send
Odd‐Eyes to the graveyard.

00:12:23.866 --> 00:12:26.400
It goes to my Extra Deck.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.466
You are hanging by a thread
and you know it, Yuya!

00:12:29.466 --> 00:12:32.233
One more incorrect move
and you are through!

00:12:32.233 --> 00:12:36.633
Maybe, but don't go throwing
yourself a victory party yet.

00:12:36.633 --> 00:12:38.866
Using Lizardraw's
special ability,

00:12:38.866 --> 00:12:42.066
I can draw one card for every
Performapal on the field.

00:12:42.066 --> 00:12:43.966
I may be down
a few life points,

00:12:43.966 --> 00:12:45.533
but I'm not callin' it quits,

00:12:45.533 --> 00:12:49.133
'cause I can draw
two cards from my deck!

00:12:49.133 --> 00:12:52.166
You may be a quiz whiz,
but I'm a dueling dynamo!

00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:54.966
I'll put three cards
facedown!

00:12:54.966 --> 00:12:56.200
It's your move, Pierre!

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.100
All right.
Time to swing into action!

00:13:03.133 --> 00:13:04.933
You're dueling
empty‐handed!

00:13:04.933 --> 00:13:08.066
Going forward, you will need
Action Cards to survive!

00:13:08.066 --> 00:13:09.533
But it's too late!

00:13:09.533 --> 00:13:12.466
Quiz Monkey!
Get set to attack!

00:13:12.466 --> 00:13:15.433
Defang Whip Snake!

00:13:15.433 --> 00:13:19.600
I activate
Last‐Minute Cancel!

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.966
In a flash, this trap switches
all the monsters on my field

00:13:22.966 --> 00:13:25.500
into defense mode!

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.633
Plus, any of my Performapals
that are wiped out in battle

00:13:28.633 --> 00:13:30.466
will return to my hand!

00:13:33.866 --> 00:13:35.633
(screaming)

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.000
Okay, Whip Snake,
now that you're back,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.100
let's try to get the drop
on Pierre!

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.266
You're too late, slowpoke!

00:13:43.266 --> 00:13:46.900
Quiz Sphinx,
liquidate his Lizardraw!

00:13:49.466 --> 00:13:51.133
I've gotcha, Lizardraw!

00:13:51.133 --> 00:13:53.000
You're going back
to my hand, too!

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.833
It will do you no good!

00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:57.866
I activate
my spell Double It!

00:13:57.866 --> 00:14:01.333
Since I destroyed
a monster in defense mode
using a Quiz Monster,

00:14:01.333 --> 00:14:05.900
my monster's attack points will
be doubled until my turn ends,

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.766
plus it can attack again!

00:14:08.766 --> 00:14:11.566
Pierre just has to attack
Yuya directly and he'll win!

00:14:11.566 --> 00:14:13.133
Precisely so!

00:14:13.133 --> 00:14:15.400
As Quiz Sphinx blasts you,
remember this!

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.966
You've been beaten
by the best!

00:14:16.966 --> 00:14:19.000
I still have a chance!

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.533
You're trying to reach
that Action Card,

00:14:21.533 --> 00:14:23.966
but you're simply
wasting your time

00:14:23.966 --> 00:14:25.966
We'll see about that!

00:14:25.966 --> 00:14:28.366
That card will have
the hardest question yet,

00:14:28.366 --> 00:14:31.833
so Yuya is guaranteed
to go down in flames!

00:14:31.833 --> 00:14:33.200
I'm going for it!

00:14:35.266 --> 00:14:38.033
Here's the card,
now quiz away!

00:14:39.366 --> 00:14:41.133
Action Trap activates now!

00:14:41.133 --> 00:14:45.266
The quiz category
will be Math for 5,000!

00:14:45.266 --> 00:14:48.166
A math question means
Yuya's number is up!

00:14:48.166 --> 00:14:49.500
Question!

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.300
What are the first 100 digits
in the number Pi?

00:14:55.833 --> 00:14:59.400
That one is a cinch unless
you don't know the answer!

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.466
You have five seconds
to respond.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.366
I give up.

00:15:07.366 --> 00:15:08.566
(all gasping)

00:15:08.566 --> 00:15:10.700
You're not
even taking a guess?

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.633
Then your humiliation
is complete

00:15:12.633 --> 00:15:14.166
as you flunk out of this duel

00:15:14.166 --> 00:15:16.133
and pay with your remaining
life points!

00:15:16.133 --> 00:15:17.366
<i>Adieu!</i>

00:15:17.366 --> 00:15:19.033
(Yuya)
I wanted to be wrong
this time.

00:15:19.033 --> 00:15:20.266
Huh?

00:15:20.266 --> 00:15:24.133
I activate a trap!
Performapal Reborn Force!

00:15:24.133 --> 00:15:26.700
Since a Performapal was
destroyed this turn,

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.400
any damage I take
from an effect

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.100
will be deflected from me
and dealt to you instead!

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.233
Ooh la la!

00:15:32.233 --> 00:15:34.600
Brace yourself!

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.900
(screaming)

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.100
(metallic banging)

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.200
(grunts)

00:15:42.366 --> 00:15:45.900
And if any battles are in
progress when it activates,

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.300
this trap cuts them short!

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.333
Good work!
Good work!

00:15:48.333 --> 00:15:50.400
Wunderbar!
(cackles)

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.666
(all)
It can't be!

00:15:52.666 --> 00:15:56.800
Pierre L'Supérieure took damage
from Yuya Sakaki?

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.066
He used his own ignorance
to his advantage!

00:16:00.066 --> 00:16:02.900
That's so aggravating!
(grunting)

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.700
You thought you could
cruise to victory

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.466
'cause you have
all the answers,

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:07.666
but that's not enough.

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:10.700
After all,
this isn't a quiz show.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.133
It's a duel!

00:16:13.133 --> 00:16:15.033
(gasps, the grunts)

00:16:15.033 --> 00:16:16.900
How dare you try
to lecture me!

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.000
(grunting)

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.633
I'm superior to you
in every way!

00:16:19.633 --> 00:16:22.400
I'll concede that you did
some damage this turn!

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.500
However, it won't be enough

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.266
to change the outcome
of this duel!

00:16:27.266 --> 00:16:28.833
No matter what you throw at me,

00:16:28.833 --> 00:16:30.800
I'll be left standing
at the top of the pyramid!

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.300
You think so?

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.866
Only one way to find out!

00:16:33.866 --> 00:16:34.866
It's showtime!

00:16:34.866 --> 00:16:37.200
(all cheering)

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.466
Attention, my fellow
dueling fans!

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:42.200
I will once again demonstrate

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.000
the jaw‐dropping power
of the Pendulum Scale!

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.600
Marvel with me as I summon
multiple Monsters

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.333
from Levels 2 through 7!

00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:50.500
(crowd exclaiming)

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.300
Now without further ado,
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.600
Carve the arc of victory!

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:01.166
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:17:03.633 --> 00:17:06.633
Hip hop to it, Performapal
Hip Hippo!

00:17:06.633 --> 00:17:09.633
Joining it will be
some more Performapals

00:17:09.633 --> 00:17:13.233
who are making an encore
appearance in today's duel!

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:15.633
Performapal Whip Snake!

00:17:15.633 --> 00:17:18.133
Plus, Performapal
Lizardraw!

00:17:18.133 --> 00:17:20.300
And last but not least,

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.300
give it up for
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.933
I activate my trap
Final Question!

00:17:29.933 --> 00:17:31.533
Answer me this‐‐

00:17:31.533 --> 00:17:33.233
at the beginning
of this battle,

00:17:33.233 --> 00:17:35.633
how many monsters
are on the field?

00:17:35.633 --> 00:17:38.033
Another crazy question!

00:17:38.033 --> 00:17:40.166
If you reply correctly,

00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:42.033
then all my monsters
will be wiped out,

00:17:42.033 --> 00:17:44.933
but if you are wrong
you lose all your monsters!

00:17:44.933 --> 00:17:47.466
Now, give me
your answer!

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:49.700
You have two monsters
on your field

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.600
and there's four on mine.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.600
The answer's six!
You hear me?

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.900
Well done!
I laid a trap,

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.666
and you fell
right into it!

00:17:58.666 --> 00:18:01.333
My Card Chute has
an amazing power

00:18:01.333 --> 00:18:03.233
that's sure to have you
scratching your head.

00:18:03.233 --> 00:18:05.500
It increases the attack points
of Quiz Sphinx

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.566
by adding my Monkey's
attack points to it,

00:18:07.566 --> 00:18:09.133
so once you do the math,

00:18:09.133 --> 00:18:11.833
Quiz Sphinx gets
a 2,500 point power‐up!

00:18:11.833 --> 00:18:14.366
Then Quiz Monkey swings
back to my hand!

00:18:14.366 --> 00:18:15.533
Behold!

00:18:15.533 --> 00:18:17.366
With one less monster
on the field,

00:18:17.366 --> 00:18:19.333
there will
only be five left!

00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:22.966
Your answer was six,
so you're wrong!

00:18:22.966 --> 00:18:26.933
Say au revoir to your
entire monster menagerie!

00:18:31.133 --> 00:18:35.000
Say au revoir to your
entire monster menagerie!

00:18:36.566 --> 00:18:38.200
(laughs maniacally)

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.066
Your faux pas cost you
dearly!

00:18:40.066 --> 00:18:42.666
I have you hopelessly
outnumbered now, Yuya!

00:18:42.666 --> 00:18:43.933
(laughs maniacally)

00:18:43.933 --> 00:18:46.166
It's my turn to ask you
a question, Pierre!

00:18:46.166 --> 00:18:49.966
My question is‐‐
who's going to win this duel?

00:18:51.833 --> 00:18:54.000
Since I can't lose,
the answer is me.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.700
That's totally
incorrect!
Huh?

00:18:58.033 --> 00:18:59.800
I hope you like surprises,

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.900
'cause when this smoke
finally clears,

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.200
you're gonna see something

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.400
that is guaranteed
to rock this school!

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.533
I present to you
my mighty Odd‐Eyes!

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.033
(gasps)

00:19:12.033 --> 00:19:15.333
(loud gasp)
<i>Incroyable!</i>

00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:17.200
I cannot believe my eyes!

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.300
How did you do
such a thing?

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:23.966
I simply activated my trusty
trap Performapal Curtain Call!

00:19:23.966 --> 00:19:25.966
It came in handy,
'cause it just negated

00:19:25.966 --> 00:19:27.966
my Pendulum Dragon's
destruction!

00:19:27.966 --> 00:19:31.133
It also pumps up Odd‐Eyes'
attack points by 600

00:19:31.133 --> 00:19:33.733
for every Performapal
that you destroyed this turn.

00:19:33.733 --> 00:19:36.566
Ugh.
(groans)

00:19:36.566 --> 00:19:39.766
Odd‐Eyes, focus all
your fury on Quiz Sphinx

00:19:39.766 --> 00:19:41.466
and get set to strike!

00:19:41.466 --> 00:19:43.166
Bad move!

00:19:43.166 --> 00:19:45.700
You forgot all about
Quiz Sphinx's ability!

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.033
Remember you have to answer
a question,

00:19:48.033 --> 00:19:49.533
and whether
you're right or wrong,

00:19:49.533 --> 00:19:50.766
you'll come up the loser!

00:19:50.766 --> 00:19:54.066
F.Y.I., question time
is over, Pierre,

00:19:54.066 --> 00:19:56.966
'cause Performapal Curtain Call
negates your spells,

00:19:56.966 --> 00:19:58.400
traps,
and special abilities!

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.700
<i>Quoi?</i>

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.166
Your trap put my Not So Fast
trap on hold?

00:20:03.166 --> 00:20:05.933
Odd‐Eyes,
time to turn up the heat!

00:20:05.933 --> 00:20:08.633
Since you're battling a monster
that's at least Level 5,

00:20:08.633 --> 00:20:11.266
you can smash that
Quiz Sphinx to smithereens

00:20:11.266 --> 00:20:13.966
and then the aftershock
will deal double‐damage

00:20:13.966 --> 00:20:17.100
to our not‐so‐friendly friend,
the trivia hound!

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.200
(explosion)

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.833
(screaming)

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.933
You said you couldn't lose,
Pierre,

00:20:22.933 --> 00:20:25.800
but it looks like
you were incorrect.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.400
'Cause you just lost
big‐time, to me!

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.066
(grunting)

00:20:31.066 --> 00:20:34.333
I thought losing was
out of the question.

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:36.000
It's over.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.733
Yuya, I tip my toupée
to you!

00:20:37.733 --> 00:20:39.633
In all my years
as a dueling manager,

00:20:39.633 --> 00:20:41.933
that was the most dynamic
display of cardsmanship

00:20:41.933 --> 00:20:43.400
I've ever seen!

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.600
Yuya, on behalf of the students
and faculty of Clarity Prep,

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.433
I offer our thanks.

00:20:48.433 --> 00:20:50.600
Today you reminded us
that true greatness

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.666
isn't just about dueling
with your head,

00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:55.800
but with your heart.
(chuckles)

00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:00.000
Perhaps I still have a few
things to learn after all.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.233
Hmm.
(man)
Bravo, Master Sakaki!

00:21:03.233 --> 00:21:06.200
(cheers and applause)

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.400
(chanting)
Yuya! Yuya!

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.566
Yuya!
Yuya!

00:21:13.866 --> 00:21:17.033
And that, my friends,
is checkmate!

00:21:17.033 --> 00:21:18.233
(chuckles)

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.466
(Claude on monitor)
Mr. President,
we've picked up a surge

00:21:23.466 --> 00:21:24.733
in Fusion
Summoning energy.

00:21:24.733 --> 00:21:27.066
The levels exceed anything
we've seen before.

00:21:27.066 --> 00:21:29.033
Acknowledged.

00:21:29.033 --> 00:21:31.166
It would appear
one of our competitors

00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:34.166
possesses a most
unusual talent.

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:10.433
