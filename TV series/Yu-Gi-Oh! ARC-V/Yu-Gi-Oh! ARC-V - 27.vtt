♪

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:06.033
(Skip Boyle)
Sure, we only have six students
here at the You Show School.

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:07.600
But what we lack in numbers,

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.833
we make up for
with guts.

00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:12.533
I knew you kids were talented,
but who'd have guessed

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.566
you'd all qualify for
the ARC League Championship!?

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.800
It's the proudest moment of
my dueling career!

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.800
Let's bring it in, everybody!

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.966
Oh!

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:25.866
(moaning)

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.366
(bicycle bell dinging)

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.566
Let's pretend
that didn't happen.

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:32.000
Okay, I don't have a problem
with that.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.633
Shouldn't we be making
a beeline for the arena?

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:37.466
(grunts)
Right you are, Allie.

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.766
(clearing throat)

00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:41.400
But first let's have
a quick refresher.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.466
As you may remember,
this championship

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.933
will be sectioned off
into three age brackets,

00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.666
beginning with
the Youth Division.

00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.366
That's where Tate, Allie,
and Frederick are competing.

00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.700
(all)
Right!

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.200
While Yuya, Zuzu, and Sora

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.466
are competing
in the Junior Division.

00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.900
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.033
(Skip)
Unless you've been asleep
for the last decade,

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:02.966
you know that these
League Championships
are a titanic deal!

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.833
Of course, all the top duel
schools will be represented

00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:09.700
by their best and brightest,
including the Leo Institute.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.533
But there will also be
incredible duelists
from across the globe!

00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.833
So this is our chance
to show the world that

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:19.333
You Show's dueltaining style
of combat is the best.

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.966
You've all been terrific
teammates to each other,

00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.866
but starting now
it's gut‐check time,

00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:26.566
and I want you to think of each
other as potential rivals.

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:28.800
Torch all your competitors!

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.700
Burn up the field!
Feed the flames!

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.600
Keep turning up the heat
on your rivals

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.100
till you reach victory
in a blaze of glory!

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.533
Attack in a relentless
inferno of fiery fury!

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.133
All set.
I can't wait.

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.700
Time to hit zee Autobahn.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.100
Let's get rolling.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.000
All right, next stop,
the ARC League Championship.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.100
(all)
Yeah!

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.633
(cheering)

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:56.666
(Skip)
Time for the You Show Express
to get underway.

00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:59.000
(engine starts)
Onward to Victoryville.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.766
There's no stopping us now.

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:02.766
Ahh!

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:03.900
What's wrong, Zuzu?

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.566
Sorry, Dad, but we're
one passenger short.

00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:07.833
Who's missing?

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.600
(all)
Where's Yuya?

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.200

(crowd chatter)

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.833
This is Joy Jeever reporting
live from Paradise Square.

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:28.633
The whole city is sizzling
with excitement.

00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:29.866
And why?

00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:31.366
Because one of the year's most
exciting events

00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:33.033
is just about to kick off.

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:35.933
I'm talking about
the ARC League Championship.

00:03:35.933 --> 00:03:39.300
Crowds are filling the arena,
eager to see their favorite

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.000
duelists face‐off
in the fantastically realistic

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.533
environments generated by
the Leo Corporation's

00:03:44.533 --> 00:03:47.166
Augmented Reality Combat system.

00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:50.533
This remarkable technology has
revolutionized Action Dueling,

00:03:50.533 --> 00:03:53.033
placing duelists directly
in the thick of battle.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:54.566
It's no wonder this pastime

00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:56.533
has the world's most fanatic
fan base.

00:03:56.533 --> 00:03:58.733
They can't wait for this
tournament to start.

00:03:58.733 --> 00:04:00.033
Neither can I.

00:04:00.033 --> 00:04:02.466
Any minute now the opening
ceremonies will begin,

00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:05.200
and we can expect
this crowd to go wild.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.566
(crowd cheering)

00:04:06.566 --> 00:04:08.700
Huh?
Is the ceremony starting?

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.200
No, wait, he's here.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.066
We have a major
celebrity sighting.

00:04:12.066 --> 00:04:14.300
It's the one and only
Declan Akaba,

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.133
President of Leo Corporation,

00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:17.933
the main sponsor
of this competition.

00:04:17.933 --> 00:04:19.500
Listen to that crowd
as they welcome

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.466
one of the dueling world's
greatest stars.

00:04:21.466 --> 00:04:24.933
(all)
Declan, we love you!

00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:27.066
What an electric moment.

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:29.900
It seems like ages since Declan
made a public appearance

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.166
at a dueling event.

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:34.200
(crowd chanting)
Declan, Declan!

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.566
Ahh...

00:04:37.266 --> 00:04:40.500
How come that guy is
so popular anyway?

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.766
Seriously?

00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:44.066
Don't tell me you haven't
heard of Declan Akaba.

00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:45.400
He's huge.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.466
One of the all‐time great
living legends.

00:04:47.466 --> 00:04:49.066
When he was
a little kid, they said

00:04:49.066 --> 00:04:52.133
Declan was a dueling prodigy and
he proved it was true.

00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:54.700
He won League Championships
in all three divisions,

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.500
then went pro
when he was just a teenager.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.100
(all panting)

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.166
Any luck?

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:06.466
Nien, Allie.
Zere's no sign of Yuya.

00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:09.166
I wonder what in the world
could've happened to him?

00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:10.533
Keep looking!

00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:13.766
And call me pronto
if you spot him.

00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:17.033
We better find Yuya
before the tournament starts.

00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:19.366
Or else Yuya's chances
of becoming a pro

00:05:19.366 --> 00:05:21.333
will be over
before they even begin!

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.966
Sora, have you
seen Yuya?

00:05:30.966 --> 00:05:33.100
Mmm, nope,
not a lick of him.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.400
Well, Zuzu, what next?

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.800
I'm not sure.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.600
I called his house, but his
mom said he wasn't there.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.266
And he didn't
go back to the school.

00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:43.033
I don't have a clue where
Yuya wandered off to.

00:05:43.033 --> 00:05:44.266
(Aura)
No problem!

00:05:44.266 --> 00:05:45.500
(all)
Huh?

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.400
(Zuzu)
Aura?

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.533
If my boyfriend is lost,
then I'm the one to find him.

00:05:50.533 --> 00:05:53.733
What do you mean,
boyfriend?

00:05:53.733 --> 00:05:54.966
(all)
Whoa!

00:05:54.966 --> 00:05:56.100
Zuzu, chill out.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.633
(sighing)
I know where Yuya is.

00:05:58.633 --> 00:06:00.633
I'm having a vision of him
right now

00:06:00.633 --> 00:06:03.533
as he visits my parents to ask
them if he can take me out.

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:06.133
Oh, Mommy and Daddy,
please say yes.

00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:09.000
I'll be happy to take you out
now with one whack.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.200
Save that fury for your
first opponent, Zuzu.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.800
What should we do?

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.200
They're gonna start
the championship soon.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.900
Have no fear.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.266
If my clairvoyant powers
can't locate Yuya,

00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:20.800
then the power
of my love will.

00:06:24.866 --> 00:06:27.800
Where are you,
my darling sweetie pie?

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.000
(all screaming)

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.600
Oh, speak to my heart,
honey dearest.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.766
I see him!
(all gasp)

00:06:33.766 --> 00:06:36.166
(gasps)
Where is Yuya?

00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:37.600
That way.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.466
Huh?
I don't see him.

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:41.500
Because you're not looking
hard enough!

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.100
He's way over there
on that bridge.

00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:54.133
(Yuya)
Well, Dad, this is it.

00:06:54.133 --> 00:06:56.300
You knew this day would come
eventually.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.200
And you tried your best
to prepare me.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.533
You're facing
Sledgehammer next.

00:07:01.533 --> 00:07:04.166
He's supposed to be really
strong, isn't he?

00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:06.800
Yeah, but don't
you worry, Yuya.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.133
As long I stay true
to myself

00:07:09.133 --> 00:07:11.766
and keep the audience
dueltained, I'll be fine.

00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:15.300
Try to remember
that when you battle
in a tournament yourself.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.666
Sure, one day I'll be
a professional,

00:07:17.666 --> 00:07:19.533
and I'll battle
just like you.

00:07:19.533 --> 00:07:23.400
That's nice of you to say, but
don't be afraid to be Yuya.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.400
You don't have
to duel like me.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.733
When your time comes, I want
you to compete your way.

00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:34.833
Compete my way.

00:07:36.266 --> 00:07:37.766
(Yoko)
You certainly know how to turn

00:07:37.766 --> 00:07:39.900
everyone's life upside down,
mister.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.766
Hi, Mom.

00:07:41.766 --> 00:07:44.833
It so happens that while
you were here daydreaming,

00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:47.966
your friends have been
frantically looking for you.

00:07:47.966 --> 00:07:50.333
Is everything okay?

00:07:52.133 --> 00:07:54.600
I needed... alone time.

00:07:57.833 --> 00:07:59.500
Yuya...
Huh?

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.133
Your dad was the same way
before a big duel.

00:08:02.133 --> 00:08:03.833
Uh‐huh.

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:06.200
It's time for you to shine
and take the stage.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.166
All of your fans are
waiting for you over there.

00:08:09.166 --> 00:08:11.100
And no matter
what happens,

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.866
remember that
your father and I are
always proud of you.

00:08:13.866 --> 00:08:16.100
You got it, Mom.

00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:25.333
I heard Yuya Sakaki
went AWOL.

00:08:25.333 --> 00:08:28.100
Yeah, guess he's scared
just like his father.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.000
If he doesn't turn up soon,
it'll be too late.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.433
I know.

00:08:33.433 --> 00:08:35.866
(Yuya)
Oh, great,
I finally found you.

00:08:35.866 --> 00:08:38.400
Huh?
Guys, over here!

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.900
What's up?
I made it.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.333
(all)
It's Yuya!

00:08:42.333 --> 00:08:44.933
He's back.

00:08:44.933 --> 00:08:45.933
(Yuya)
You miss me?

00:08:45.933 --> 00:08:47.333
Did we miss you?

00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:49.333
We drove ourselves crazy
all morning

00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:50.600
trying to track you down.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.000
Well, now you can
call off the search.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.600
We better get movin'.
Don't wanna be late.

00:08:56.866 --> 00:08:58.233
You can be so annoying.

00:08:58.233 --> 00:09:00.800
Me, annoying?
Oof.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.500
Watch where you're waddlin',
small fry.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.033
Grizzelpike!

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.633
I'm shocked that
you didn't decide

00:09:12.633 --> 00:09:14.500
to hightail it
out of the championship,

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.533
just like your wimpy
old man once did.

00:09:16.533 --> 00:09:17.666
What'd you say?

00:09:17.666 --> 00:09:19.300
I still can't figure out
how the son

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.066
of a despicable coward
beat Sledgehammer.

00:09:22.066 --> 00:09:23.666
Who's he?

00:09:23.666 --> 00:09:25.200
Don't know.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.633
No Sakaki is worthy of
dueling in this stadium.

00:09:28.633 --> 00:09:31.533
Now, how's about I show you
and your lousy cards

00:09:31.533 --> 00:09:32.600
where the exit is?

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.633
(menacing chuckle)

00:09:34.633 --> 00:09:36.100
(growling)

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.766
(Gong)
Back off, Grizzelpike!

00:09:37.766 --> 00:09:39.666
Huh?
Huh?

00:09:39.666 --> 00:09:40.800
(Yuya)
Gong!

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.566
Ha, so you're still this
shrimp's bodyguard, eh?

00:09:45.566 --> 00:09:49.066
That figures.
Once a coward always a coward.

00:09:49.066 --> 00:09:51.500
I'd be careful what you say
about my best friend.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
(lightning cracks)

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.833
The opening ceremonies will
kick off shortly!

00:09:57.833 --> 00:10:00.133
All duelists,
please take your places

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:01.933
<i>behind your team banners!</i>

00:10:01.933 --> 00:10:04.500
Heh, tough talk
means squat to me.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.800
Let's see how tough
you are on the field.

00:10:10.633 --> 00:10:13.433
That guy gives skunks
a bad name.

00:10:14.733 --> 00:10:16.300
I'm glad
to see you, Gong.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.433
I was worried you wouldn't
make the cut.

00:10:18.433 --> 00:10:21.600
Ha, you can't keep
a good duelist down.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.500
Just before
the registration deadline,

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.866
Gong got just enough wins
to make it.

00:10:25.866 --> 00:10:29.000
You did?
All right!

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.166
Put 'er there, buddy.

00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:31.933
(Gong chuckles)

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.700
(chuckling)

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.966
Greetings to all my fellow
dueling fanatics

00:10:39.966 --> 00:10:41.533
both near and far.

00:10:41.533 --> 00:10:44.666
The day we've been yearning for
has arrived as we flip

00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:47.733
the """on" switch for this
year's ARC League Championship.

00:10:47.733 --> 00:10:49.700
My name's Nico Smiley

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.700
and I'm thrilled
to be your opening ceremony host

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.633
from coast to coast.

00:10:53.633 --> 00:10:57.600
So let the ARC League
Championship begin!

00:11:04.733 --> 00:11:08.466
And now let's kick off
the ARC League Championship!

00:11:08.466 --> 00:11:10.466
(crowd cheering)

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.700
Our daring duelists
will march in by school.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.066
<i>Take it away, Joy.</i>

00:11:18.066 --> 00:11:19.266
(Joy Jeever)
<i>Thanks, Nico.</i>

00:11:19.266 --> 00:11:21.300
First up, the Leo
Institute of Dueling.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.833
Last year, Leo dominated
the championships

00:11:23.833 --> 00:11:25.100
by winning all
three divisions.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.266
With the largest contingent
of duelists

00:11:27.266 --> 00:11:28.766
in this year's
championship,

00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:31.666
they're a hands‐down favorite
to make another trophy
sweep.

00:11:31.666 --> 00:11:32.566
Huh?
Huh?

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.300
That guy?
He's dueling
for Leo now?

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.500
Our second group is determined
to chop its way to victory.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.900
It's the Banded Warrior Academy,

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.466
the most powerful proponents
of martial arts style
dueling.

00:11:46.466 --> 00:11:49.133
Their best student, Iggy
Arlo, finished second

00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:52.866
in the Junior League last
year and is now out for
revenge.

00:11:52.866 --> 00:11:56.233
And stepping up next, a team
from far across the sea,

00:11:56.233 --> 00:11:58.666
the mysterious Knights of
the Duel Disk.

00:11:58.666 --> 00:12:01.166
Behind them, we have
another hometown team

00:12:01.166 --> 00:12:04.400
and I'm sure they're ready to
take down the competition!

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.400
(Shay)
You say you're willing
to duel me,

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.033
but only if I enter
the championship?

00:12:10.033 --> 00:12:11.366
Correct.

00:12:11.366 --> 00:12:13.866
That event will help us
to single out those duelists

00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:15.333
who are the best of the best

00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:17.866
to join my fight
against Leo Akaba.

00:12:17.866 --> 00:12:19.766
You're battling your father?

00:12:19.766 --> 00:12:22.400
It is true that
he is my father.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.633
He's also our common enemy,

00:12:24.633 --> 00:12:27.766
and I will stop at nothing
to take him down.

00:12:27.766 --> 00:12:30.633
Among the other duelists
who are competing,

00:12:30.633 --> 00:12:33.400
there is one who uses
the most powerful Fusions

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.666
I've ever detected.

00:12:34.666 --> 00:12:37.233
And there will be another
duelist who uses a new

00:12:37.233 --> 00:12:40.433
summoning method unlike anything
you've ever seen before.

00:12:40.433 --> 00:12:43.400
You will be my eyes
and ears on the field.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.100
I want you to determine whether
they have the skills

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.500
needed to join
my great fight.

00:12:50.933 --> 00:12:55.033
(Joy Jeever)
Entering the stadium now is
the Abracadabra Academy,

00:12:55.033 --> 00:12:58.066
famous for their philosophy
of dueling by deception.

00:12:58.066 --> 00:13:01.233
Their star pupil is
Trick Taggart.

00:13:01.233 --> 00:13:03.533
So you know the guy
that was marching in

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:04.900
with the other
Leo students?

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.400
Yeah.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.500
I watched that guy take on
three elite Leo team members

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.533
all by himself.
(gasps)

00:13:10.533 --> 00:13:13.200
Rolling in now
are the Dueling Dynamos,

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.900
home to some of today's
hottestsingers, dancers, and
duelists.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.700
(gasps)
There's Micky Starlet.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.833
She looks sweet, but in
combat, she's ferocious.

00:13:21.833 --> 00:13:24.033
Walking into the spotlight
now are students

00:13:24.033 --> 00:13:27.033
from that small training
facility for Dueltainers,

00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:29.566
the You Show School.
(crowd cheering)

00:13:29.566 --> 00:13:32.666
Go, kids!
Break a duel disk.
Ahh!

00:13:32.666 --> 00:13:35.833
Battle your opponents
with that old You Show
razzamatazz.

00:13:35.833 --> 00:13:38.333
This crowd has its radar
screens tuned

00:13:38.333 --> 00:13:40.100
to You Show's
Yuya Sakaki.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.166
His Pendulum Summoning
has become the talk
of the dueling world.

00:13:43.166 --> 00:13:46.500
I expect we'll see him
unleashit early on in this
tournament.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.033
(Tournament Chairman)
<i>Greetings, duelists.</i>

00:13:50.033 --> 00:13:51.933
You have battled hard
to be here.

00:13:51.933 --> 00:13:54.100
The fact that
you stand before me now

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.500
is proof that you are truly
among the elite.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.633
I know that in
the coming days you will face

00:13:58.633 --> 00:14:01.466
the challenges ahead with
distinction and dignity.

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:03.733
(applause)

00:14:03.733 --> 00:14:06.900
Now one of our competitors will
recite the Duelist's Oath.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.700
And the honor goes to
You Show School's Yuya Sakaki!

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.666
Ah!
What do you mean me?!

00:14:13.666 --> 00:14:15.533
Recite the Duelists Oath?

00:14:15.533 --> 00:14:17.833
Does Yuya even
know it?
Oh, boy!

00:14:17.833 --> 00:14:20.366
Thanks for picking me,
but I decline.

00:14:20.366 --> 00:14:23.400
(Nico Smiley)
Our marshals will now escort
Yuya to the podium.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.566
Ahh!

00:14:24.566 --> 00:14:27.766
Yuya, proclaim that oath
with pride, buddy.

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:29.033
Whoa!
(grunts)

00:14:29.033 --> 00:14:30.200
(boy)
Way to take the stage!

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.666
(girl)
Totally ate it.

00:14:31.666 --> 00:14:35.200
Now, now, this is no time
for comedy routines, my boy.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.000
Remember,
it's a great honor

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.933
to recite the oath,
but no pressure.

00:14:38.933 --> 00:14:40.666
Uh‐oh.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.566
And now the oath.

00:14:43.566 --> 00:14:45.566
(applause)

00:14:45.566 --> 00:14:47.066
(clearing throat, feedback)

00:14:47.066 --> 00:14:49.233
<i>I, Suya Yokaki...</i>

00:14:49.233 --> 00:14:50.900
(crowd gasps)

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.800
His brain has shut down.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.300
Like it's full
of sauerkraut.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.800
I promise!

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.300
Yuya,
stop freaking out!

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.100
Say it in your own way.

00:15:01.533 --> 00:15:04.066
(Yuya thinking)
Say it my own way.

00:15:05.966 --> 00:15:07.733
Like Dad would have done.

00:15:07.733 --> 00:15:09.266
(sighs)

00:15:11.366 --> 00:15:13.633
Yuya's brain
has frozen up.

00:15:13.633 --> 00:15:16.466
Trust me, Skip,
he'll be just fine.
Huh?

00:15:21.566 --> 00:15:24.666
(sighing)

00:15:24.666 --> 00:15:27.466
Greetings, fellow dueling fans.

00:15:27.466 --> 00:15:30.200
I was asked to come up here
and recite the Duelist's
Oath.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.233
But since must of us know
the it by heart,

00:15:32.233 --> 00:15:35.000
I've decided instead to tell
you something you don't
know,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.900
the story of why
I'm here today.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.600
You probably know by now that
I'm the son of Yusho Sakaki.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.800
He was one of the most
popular dueltainers

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.600
who ever stepped into
a stadium,

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.633
and definitely
one of the greatest.

00:15:47.633 --> 00:15:49.700
Then, one day, he shocked
everybody

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.633
when he disappeared
just before a big duel.

00:15:52.633 --> 00:15:54.200
Some kids used to tease me

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.500
by saying I was a coward
like my father.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.666
So I worked hard
to prove 'em wrong.

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:01.200
But I still couldn't face
my problems.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.233
Until one day I learned
how to Pendulum Summon.

00:16:05.233 --> 00:16:07.033
Sure, my duels were
more difficult,

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:08.866
but I was having fun again.

00:16:08.866 --> 00:16:10.700
I still have a lot
to learn

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.666
and have a long journey
ahead of me,

00:16:12.666 --> 00:16:15.433
but I'll never forget
to have fun along the way,

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:17.966
because that's what we all love
about dueling,

00:16:17.966 --> 00:16:20.133
and that's why we're all here.

00:16:20.133 --> 00:16:22.700
Someday I'm going to become
a great dueltainer

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.266
like my father was.

00:16:24.266 --> 00:16:27.466
I promise that I'll never stop
trying to improve my skills,

00:16:27.466 --> 00:16:30.666
that I'll always duel fairly,
and that I'll do everything

00:16:30.666 --> 00:16:34.900
I can to help others love
Action Dueling as much as we
do.

00:16:37.533 --> 00:16:39.433
(applause)

00:16:43.033 --> 00:16:46.033
(crowd cheering)

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.466
Is he great or what?

00:16:52.466 --> 00:16:55.733
Ha, that was even better than
the official Duelist's Oath.

00:16:55.733 --> 00:16:57.900
Take a bow, kiddo,
you're a hit.

00:17:03.066 --> 00:17:05.933
Ha‐ha‐ha!
That was spectacular!

00:17:05.933 --> 00:17:09.866
Yoko, if that boy of yours
duels as well as he just spoke,

00:17:09.866 --> 00:17:13.100
then he has got the Junior ARC
League title all locked up.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.800
Don't get ahead
of yourself.
Huh?

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.333
He hasn't won
a thing yet.

00:17:16.333 --> 00:17:18.600
There are a lot of
talented duelists here.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.066
I guess so.

00:17:20.066 --> 00:17:24.133
If Yuya wants to become
the Junior ARC League champion,

00:17:24.133 --> 00:17:25.600
then he'll have to earn it.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.700
It's now time
for our duelists to learn

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.933
who they will be facing in
their first matches.

00:17:34.933 --> 00:17:36.766
<i>Okay, wannabe champions,</i>

00:17:36.766 --> 00:17:40.266
time to slot your competition
datacards into your Duel
Disks.

00:17:40.266 --> 00:17:43.033
What do we need these for
anyway?

00:17:43.033 --> 00:17:45.466
They'll keep track of us
and how we're doing.

00:17:45.466 --> 00:17:49.100
(Nico Smiley)
I'm no tech expert, but I'm told
our central computamajiggy

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.666
bleeps out teeny info‐bolts
right to your cards

00:17:51.666 --> 00:17:53.166
to tell them your opponent.

00:17:53.166 --> 00:17:55.700
We'll use the cards to keep
track of winners and losers,

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.466
then tally those results
to calculate the next matchups.

00:17:58.466 --> 00:18:02.766
I wonder if I can use these
to order snacks, too.

00:18:02.766 --> 00:18:05.200
Now let's see
who I'm gonna duel first?

00:18:08.033 --> 00:18:09.166
Sylvio?!

00:18:09.166 --> 00:18:12.666
My first opponent is...
Julia!

00:18:12.666 --> 00:18:15.000
I'm gonna duel...
tomorrow.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.800
My duel is this afternoon.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.200
(Gong)
Gong's gonna have his work
cut out for him.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.800
Why?
Who's your opponent?

00:18:24.766 --> 00:18:26.000
Grizzelpike?!

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.866
We were destined to duel.

00:18:28.866 --> 00:18:31.533
Mien duel starts
after we wrap up here.

00:18:31.533 --> 00:18:33.000
And then I'm up next.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.066
So Frederick, Allie,
and Zuzu will represent

00:18:35.066 --> 00:18:37.066
the first wave
of Team You Show.

00:18:37.066 --> 00:18:38.300
And you, Sora?

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.366
I duel tomorrow.

00:18:39.366 --> 00:18:41.866
Against someone
from the Leo Institute.

00:18:41.866 --> 00:18:44.033
A Leo duelist?
Which one?

00:18:44.033 --> 00:18:46.000
Some guy named
Shay Obsidian.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.333
Huh?
(gasps)

00:18:47.333 --> 00:18:48.533
See for yourself.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.733
Lulu!

00:18:53.733 --> 00:18:56.166
You're going up against
Shay Obsidian.

00:18:56.166 --> 00:18:57.666
(Julia)
There you are, Zuzu.

00:18:57.666 --> 00:19:00.300
My first victim of
the tournament.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.066
(Zuzu)
Julia, Julia, I know
you don't like me and all,

00:19:03.066 --> 00:19:05.300
but I gotta warn you,
there's this guy named Shay

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.966
who's infiltrated
LID's tournament team.

00:19:07.966 --> 00:19:10.866
Shay's been
at the institute all year.

00:19:10.866 --> 00:19:13.833
He was in my Advanced Dueling
Linguistics class last semester.

00:19:13.833 --> 00:19:15.233
What?!

00:19:15.233 --> 00:19:16.600
What are you
talking about?

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.300
Sora Perse, got it.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.066
(Joy Jeever)
I direct your attention
to Duel Court 3,

00:19:25.066 --> 00:19:26.666
where You Show's fearless
Frederick

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:30.033
takes on the SuperDuelist
School's superstar, Trevor.

00:19:30.033 --> 00:19:33.166
NNThis is the very first
matchup of our Youth League.

00:19:33.166 --> 00:19:36.066
Frederick,
Papa's proud of you.

00:19:36.066 --> 00:19:37.300
Mama, too!

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.500
Come on, win it
for the SuperDuelists.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.666
Go, Trevor!

00:19:40.666 --> 00:19:42.900
All right, Red Mask,

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.000
fly at Doodle Beast Stego
and take it out.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.366
(Joy Jeever)
That's Trevor's most powerful
masked monster.

00:19:49.366 --> 00:19:50.900
Schtop right zere!

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.400
I have a trap zat can make
your attack go kerplunk.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.233
It's called Doodlebook,
unh‐unh‐unh!

00:19:57.233 --> 00:19:59.566
Hurrah, Wunderbar!

00:19:59.566 --> 00:20:02.600
You've thwarted me
for now, villain.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.333
Und now I'll shnap you
like an uncooked noodle.

00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:07.100
Perfect.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.666
By tributing a Sketch Beast
like Stego,

00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:13.600
I can zen summon another of mein
handcrafted monstermeisters.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.600
It's zah most destructive
dino in mein deck.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.000
(laughing)
Whoa!

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.866
As you can see,
the fields in the Youth League

00:20:21.866 --> 00:20:24.233
are designed to add lots of
bounce to the duels.

00:20:24.233 --> 00:20:27.033
Now face zee terror
of mein Tyranno!

00:20:27.033 --> 00:20:29.733
(roaring)

00:20:29.733 --> 00:20:31.933
Sehr gut!
Zat's meinboy.

00:20:31.933 --> 00:20:34.833
Tyranno,
use your special ability.

00:20:34.833 --> 00:20:38.200
Tyranno automatically makes
your monster go kaput.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.500
After zat, Tyranno gets half
of zat monster's attack points

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.666
und can have a powerfest.

00:20:43.666 --> 00:20:46.300
Okay, Tyranno, attack Trevor
with Dino Destruction.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.033
(growling)

00:20:49.033 --> 00:20:50.466
(roaring)
(screaming)

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.566
(Trevor)
My super powers failed.

00:20:54.566 --> 00:20:56.600
And that does it for Trevor.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.766
You Show's Frederick has won
the first duel.

00:20:58.766 --> 00:21:00.333
Victory!

00:21:01.866 --> 00:21:03.366
(Skip)
Atta boy, Frederick.

00:21:03.366 --> 00:21:06.600
You just scored You Show's first
win of the championships!

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.166
(Yuya)
You were spectacular.

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:10.133
(Frederick)
It was a piece of strudel.

00:21:10.133 --> 00:21:12.066
Try not to get
overconfident.

00:21:12.066 --> 00:21:15.366
Gong admits you took
an important step today,
little fella.

00:21:15.366 --> 00:21:17.333
But always remember
the saying,

00:21:17.333 --> 00:21:19.666
"One tree does
not a forest make."

00:21:19.666 --> 00:21:22.166
(laughs)
That sounds like it came
from a fortune cookie.

00:21:22.166 --> 00:21:24.666
Those cookies pack
a lot of wisdom!

00:21:24.666 --> 00:21:26.533
Aren't you
next, Allie?

00:21:26.533 --> 00:21:27.700
Yeah.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.800
It says my challenger is
from the Leo Institute.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.733
From Leo?

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:10.433
♪
