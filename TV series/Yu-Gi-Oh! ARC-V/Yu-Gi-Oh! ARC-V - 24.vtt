WEBVTT

00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.566
(Claude)
Give me a status report
on the operatives.

00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.200
(Operator A)
Sir, we're tracking
Dipper O'rion

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.733
through District Area TF‐13.

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.333
(Claude)
What about Julia?

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:13.300
(Operator B)
She just crossed
into District ZX‐97.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.766
(Operator C)
I don't know what's going on,

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.900
but I'm not
picking up Kit's signal.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.333
He might've wandered
outside the operation zone.

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.400
Expand the surveillance
parameters, now.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.766
I knew using these kids
as bait was a bad idea.

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.633
(Declan)
Just make sure the Enforcement
Team is ready to engage.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:30.800
They're on standby.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.700
Our targets are near.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.233
I feel it.

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:38.766

(Sora)
Let's have a big party to
celebrate the fact

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:41.200
that we made it into
the Championship! (chuckling)

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.666
It's too early.
Huh?

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:46.366
You may have made it into
the championship.

00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:48.233
But I still need
one more win.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:49.500
Yeah, but...

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.333
What if you end up
not qualifying?

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:52.900
Will I still get a party?

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.833
I'll qualify!

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:56.533
'Cause I kinda already
ordered the cake.

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:57.800
We'll just have
to slice off

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.033
the "Go Yuya" section
if you don't make it.

00:02:00.033 --> 00:02:02.333
What kinda cake is it?

00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:06.733
This card,
isn't right for you.

00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:09.000
(Sora)
I don't think I should tell
you what kind it is,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.233
that might jinx it.

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:12.933
(Yuya)
Come on, gimme a hint!

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:14.600
No.
Come on!

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.133
It's chocolate popcorn,
isn't it!?

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:18.266
Where you goin', Zuzu?

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:20.566
Gotta go to a place
about a thing.

00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:22.066
Ah, what now?

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:23.600
Maybe she ordered
a cake, too.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.900
(Zuzu)
You know, got laundry to mail
and letters to wash!

00:02:35.566 --> 00:02:36.500
(surprised gasp)

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:41.666
You're alone?

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:43.933
You should be careful,
it's not safe out.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.166
(Julia)
Now listen, I can
take care of myself.

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:50.400
It's you who
should watch your back!

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.066
You're the one who attacked
Professor Marco, aren't you?!

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:55.033
Why don't you
just admit it?!

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:56.666
Who's Marco?

00:02:56.666 --> 00:02:59.133
You know who
I'm talking about!

00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:00.666
The Leo Institute Professor

00:03:00.666 --> 00:03:02.400
who teaches
in the Fusion Department.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.366
Oh, him?

00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:05.733
Hmph.

00:03:05.733 --> 00:03:07.966
He was quite
the disappointment.

00:03:07.966 --> 00:03:10.833
I was hoping he'd at least
put up a good struggle.

00:03:10.833 --> 00:03:12.966
But he was pathetic.
Be quiet!

00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:16.633
Someone as rotten as you doesn't
get to talk like that about him.

00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:18.466
Well, he's not alone.

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:21.200
Everyone from Leo
has been so weak.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.133
And completely predictable.

00:03:23.133 --> 00:03:26.766
No real passion, no respect
for the true art of the duel.

00:03:26.766 --> 00:03:29.866
(Julia)
Are you saying you beat
the others too?

00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:31.933
Why not find out?

00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:33.933
Challenge me to a duel.

00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:37.400
Then maybe you'll know
if I'm your guy or not.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.266
Sir, the team
is ready to go

00:03:40.266 --> 00:03:41.300
as soon as you give
the order.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.533
(Julia)
<i>Guys, I got him.</i>

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:45.300
I'm sending you my
location now, hurry up.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.100
Got it, on my way!

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.300
Sorry, but, but we've gotta
cut this a little short.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.366
(Yuto)
Looking for someone?
(gasps)

00:03:55.366 --> 00:03:56.933
Turn around
and walk away.

00:03:59.433 --> 00:04:01.433
So you called for backup?

00:04:01.433 --> 00:04:03.000
Only two people, though.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.366
You must underestimate me.

00:04:04.366 --> 00:04:07.066
You only heard two people
but now everyone

00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:09.500
at the Leo Institute knows
exactly where you are.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.466
More importantly, they know
what you look like.

00:04:12.466 --> 00:04:15.466
We've got cameras
on you right now... Smile!

00:04:15.466 --> 00:04:16.766
Or don't.

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:19.866
Either way, your little
dueling spree's about to end.

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:21.533
That's right!

00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:23.000
Came as fast as I could.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.633
I hope I didn't
miss anything exciting.

00:04:25.633 --> 00:04:27.133
Let's take this clown down

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:28.833
before the Enforcement Team
arrives.

00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:30.633
We'll be known
through the whole school

00:04:30.633 --> 00:04:32.566
as the students who
caught the bad guy.

00:04:32.566 --> 00:04:34.433
I like it.

00:04:34.433 --> 00:04:36.366
You in, Dipper?

00:04:36.366 --> 00:04:38.800
We'll use Battle Royal rules.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.600
Which means the three of us
get the chance to take you on!

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.233
Fine by me.

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:46.300
This way, I can defeat
you all in one duel.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.233
You need to leave.

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:49.400
I can't let you interfere

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.100
with my colleague's duel
with that girl.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.000
Your colleague?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.566
You mean the one
at the harbor?

00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:57.433
Is he about to duel Julia?

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.400
(all)
Let's Duel!

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.100
(all)
Let's Duel!

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.000
All right, Julia,
kick this thing off.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.600
Happy to!

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.566
First I'm summoning
Gem‐Knight Lapis!

00:05:22.866 --> 00:05:25.833
Then I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:27.333
It's your go, punk!

00:05:28.633 --> 00:05:30.166
So it is.

00:05:30.166 --> 00:05:32.366
First up, I'm playing
a little something that's gonna

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:36.366
take my game to new heights,
Raidraptor‐Vanishing Lanius.

00:05:36.366 --> 00:05:37.766
(screeching)

00:05:37.766 --> 00:05:41.366
But it won't be flying solo
when it's summoned to my field.

00:05:41.366 --> 00:05:45.200
It can bring along a friend
a second Vanishing Lanius.

00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:49.866
Next I activate the spell
Raidraptor‐Nest.

00:05:49.866 --> 00:05:53.200
Since I have two identical
Raidraptor's on my field,

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.266
I can fly a third one
from my deck to my hand.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.533
(clicking)

00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:00.766
But it won't stay
there for long.

00:06:00.766 --> 00:06:04.300
Raidraptor's special ability,
let's me summon it right away.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.633
Looks like there's one
for each of you now!

00:06:09.066 --> 00:06:10.566
(Zuzu)
You've gotta stop that duel!

00:06:10.566 --> 00:06:13.800
He'll listen to you,
end this, please, you have to.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.733
I'm sorry, it's too late.

00:06:17.733 --> 00:06:18.966
Now leave.

00:06:21.033 --> 00:06:23.266
Stop!

00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:27.166
If you try to interfere,
I can't guarantee your safety.

00:06:29.233 --> 00:06:31.033
It's my turn!

00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:34.500
And I'm gonna make some moves
that are out of this world!

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.400
Since I don't have any monsters
on my field and you do,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.100
I can summon Constellar Siat.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.333
Next I summon
Constellar Pollux.

00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:46.066
What makes it so stellar?

00:06:46.066 --> 00:06:48.200
I'll tell ya,
when it's summoned,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.066
I'm allowed to summon another
Constellar monster from my hand!

00:06:52.066 --> 00:06:54.966
So come on out,
Constellar Algiedi!

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.300
Thanks to its
special ability,

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.366
I can summon a Level 4
Constellar monster

00:07:01.366 --> 00:07:04.033
from my hand
to fight by its side.

00:07:04.033 --> 00:07:07.666
Say hello to Constellar Kaus!

00:07:07.666 --> 00:07:09.333
Now, uh...

00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:11.833
you Xyz Summon don't you?

00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:13.600
Yeah, well so do I,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.466
and I don't like you
running around town

00:07:15.466 --> 00:07:17.366
giving it a bad name.

00:07:17.366 --> 00:07:19.600
So if you
don't mind,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.966
I'm gonna show you how
a real duelist Xyz Summons.

00:07:22.966 --> 00:07:25.633
So get ready to find
out firsthand

00:07:25.633 --> 00:07:28.700
why the Leo Institute
is the best there is!

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.200
I activate Kaus's
special ability,

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.966
which grants
an additional level

00:07:32.966 --> 00:07:35.200
to both Algiedi
and itself!

00:07:37.433 --> 00:07:40.733
And now I overlay my Level 5
Constellar Algiedi

00:07:40.733 --> 00:07:43.033
and my Level 5
Constellar Kaus

00:07:43.033 --> 00:07:46.033
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:07:48.633 --> 00:07:51.000
The light
of distant stars shatters

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.033
the dark of night.

00:07:53.033 --> 00:07:55.533
I Xyz Summon!

00:07:55.533 --> 00:07:57.533
Constellar Pleiades!

00:08:00.466 --> 00:08:04.333
Now I activate the spell,
Constellar Twinkle

00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:06.033
which grants
Constellar Pollux

00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:07.400
two additional levels!

00:08:09.066 --> 00:08:11.833
Thanks to its own
special ability,

00:08:11.833 --> 00:08:13.600
Constellar Siat's Level

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.100
increases to match Pollux's.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.433
So now I'm gonna overlay
Pollux and Siat.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.266
I build the Overlay Network!

00:08:24.266 --> 00:08:27.833
I Xyz Summon,
the great and mighty

00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:30.566
Constellar Ptolemy M7!

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.033
Two back to back
Xyz Summons!

00:08:35.033 --> 00:08:36.433
Not bad, Dipper!

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.333
Mhm, and that was
just the beginning.

00:08:39.333 --> 00:08:40.666
'Cause now I'm activating

00:08:40.666 --> 00:08:43.466
Constellar Pleiades's
special ability.

00:08:43.466 --> 00:08:44.933
By using an Overlay Unit,

00:08:44.933 --> 00:08:47.966
one Vanishing Lanius
returns to your hand!

00:08:47.966 --> 00:08:49.366
And now I activate

00:08:49.366 --> 00:08:52.166
Ptolemy M7's
special ability.

00:08:52.166 --> 00:08:54.566
Why stop at getting rid
of one of your monsters

00:08:54.566 --> 00:08:56.900
when I can get rid of two?

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.266
And with that
I end my turn.

00:08:59.266 --> 00:09:01.333
All right, Kit,
it's all you now.

00:09:01.333 --> 00:09:03.366
Oh, yeah, leave it to me!

00:09:07.933 --> 00:09:10.133
(Zuzu)
Are you telling me you
can't guarantee my safety

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:12.266
if I try to stop your
pals duel with Julia?

00:09:12.266 --> 00:09:15.533
Is that some sort of threat?

00:09:15.533 --> 00:09:17.200
Answer me.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.633
Is Julia in danger
right now?

00:09:20.733 --> 00:09:22.866
Uh‐huh, yeah that's
what I figured.

00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:24.100
I've gotta help her.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.266
You can't,

00:09:25.266 --> 00:09:28.466
like I said,
it's too late.

00:09:34.233 --> 00:09:35.233
Here we go!

00:09:35.233 --> 00:09:36.500
I'll start off this blowout

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.100
by summoning
XX‐Saber Boggart Knight!

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:45.033
When this saber
swinging bad boy

00:09:45.033 --> 00:09:46.866
is successfully
summoned to the field,

00:09:46.866 --> 00:09:50.733
I can also summon a Level
4‐or‐below X‐Saber from my hand!

00:09:50.733 --> 00:09:53.166
Get set for the Level 1
Tuner Monster,

00:09:53.166 --> 00:09:55.033
X‐Saber Palomuro!

00:09:57.933 --> 00:10:00.200
And now, since I've got two
X‐Sabers on the field,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.100
I can also bust out
XX‐Saber Faultroll!

00:10:06.633 --> 00:10:08.466
You've seen
the extreme awesomeness

00:10:08.466 --> 00:10:09.800
of Dipper's Xyz Summon,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.600
but now it's time to
taste some Synchro Power!

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.533
Level 1 Palomuro tunes
Level 4 Boggart Knight!

00:10:18.566 --> 00:10:21.533
I Synchro Summon
X‐Saber Wayne!

00:10:25.766 --> 00:10:27.233
This posse isn't full yet,

00:10:27.233 --> 00:10:30.066
'cause now I can summon
another X‐Saber from my hand.

00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:35.966
So make way
for the Tuner Monster

00:10:35.966 --> 00:10:38.333
XX‐Saber Fulhelmknight!

00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:43.400
And now, thanks to Faultroll's
special ability,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.533
Palomuro returns
from the graveyard!

00:10:48.566 --> 00:10:51.866
Now, this is where
things get really awesome.

00:10:51.866 --> 00:10:55.400
My Level 3 Fulhelmknight
tunes Level 6 Faultroll!

00:10:58.566 --> 00:11:01.700
I Synchro Summon
Level 9 XX‐Saber Gottoms!

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:09.433
(grunts)

00:11:09.433 --> 00:11:11.066
But that's not the end!

00:11:11.066 --> 00:11:14.266
Now Palomuro tunes
X‐Saber Wayne

00:11:14.266 --> 00:11:16.933
to spawn an unstoppable
cyclone of steel!

00:11:21.033 --> 00:11:23.133
I Synchro Summon

00:11:23.133 --> 00:11:25.400
Level 6 XX‐Saber Hyunlei!

00:11:30.566 --> 00:11:33.266
Hmph.

00:11:33.266 --> 00:11:35.333
Hope you weren't counting on
using those facedown cards!

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:38.000
'Cause Hyunlei can destroy up
to three spell and trap cards

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.100
on the field.

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.400
(shattering)

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.900
And now I use one
of Pleiades's Overlay Units

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.466
to activate its
special ability!

00:11:46.466 --> 00:11:48.466
The last Vanishing Lanius

00:11:48.466 --> 00:11:50.833
returns to your hand.

00:11:50.833 --> 00:11:52.133
Great work!

00:11:52.133 --> 00:11:54.000
His field
is completely empty!

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.100
That's right.
Huh?

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.033
But we could tighten
the screws even more.

00:11:57.033 --> 00:12:00.200
(Kit)
It's time to call
in reinforcements!

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.733
I'm now activating
the spell card,

00:12:02.733 --> 00:12:05.300
Gottoms' Second Call!

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.400
This lets me summon XX‐Saber
Faultroll and X‐Saber Wayne

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.266
from the graveyard
with zero attack points.

00:12:11.266 --> 00:12:13.500
And now,
with Faultroll's ability,

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.433
I'm bringing back Fulhelmknight
from the graveyard.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.866
Gottoms' special
ability activates!

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:24.666
It lets me tribute one
of my X‐Sabers to force you

00:12:24.666 --> 00:12:26.333
to discard a card
from your hand.

00:12:26.333 --> 00:12:28.466
But since I have
three X‐Sabers,

00:12:28.466 --> 00:12:30.333
I think I'll get rid
of your entire hand!

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.266
(roaring)

00:12:40.966 --> 00:12:43.900
Perfect! Now your hand's
as empty as your field!

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.466
Impressive!

00:12:45.466 --> 00:12:49.033
These students really know what
they're doing, don't they?

00:12:49.033 --> 00:12:50.433
Talk to me.

00:12:50.433 --> 00:12:51.500
Who are
you guys?

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.633
What do you want?

00:12:53.633 --> 00:12:55.600
We have enemies, Zuzu.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.900
And a friend of ours
was taken by them.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.866
My colleague and I,

00:12:58.866 --> 00:13:00.900
we'll stop at nothing
to get her back.

00:13:02.766 --> 00:13:06.100
You said "her,"
is that...

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.666
Hold on, are you
talking about Lulu?

00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:10.066
(gasps)

00:13:11.066 --> 00:13:12.600
Guys, remember,

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.333
LID's top team lost
to this big bozo.

00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:16.800
I know!

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.733
That means if we
take him out,

00:13:18.733 --> 00:13:21.333
we're better than the best
that LID has to offer!

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:24.000
Well then, what are
we waiting for?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.033
I'll pass things off
to the finisher!

00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:30.133
Julia, do what
you do best!

00:13:30.133 --> 00:13:33.266
It'll be my pleasure,
Kit, Dipper.

00:13:33.266 --> 00:13:35.833
Time for this diamond to shine.

00:13:35.833 --> 00:13:39.033
Let's go!

00:13:39.033 --> 00:13:41.333
I'll start things off
by playing the spell card

00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:42.666
Gem‐Knight Fusion!

00:13:42.666 --> 00:13:45.233
It lets me fuse
Gem‐Knight Lapis

00:13:45.233 --> 00:13:47.133
with Gem‐Knight Lazuli!

00:13:47.133 --> 00:13:49.466
Two gems
sparkle together,

00:13:49.466 --> 00:13:52.933
illuminating
a new stone!

00:13:52.933 --> 00:13:54.900
I Fusion Summon

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.366
Gem‐Knight
Lady Lapis Lazuli!

00:14:03.166 --> 00:14:05.000
When your colleague saw me,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.600
he called me Lulu.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.233
Lulu?

00:14:10.666 --> 00:14:12.666
How did you...
who helped you?

00:14:12.666 --> 00:14:14.200
Did you get away?!

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.766
So is Lulu the friend
that was taken from you?

00:14:17.766 --> 00:14:19.500
Do I look like her
or something?

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.666
The first time
that I saw you,

00:14:23.666 --> 00:14:25.300
I thought you were Lulu.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.300
But then I saw you were trying
to learn Fusion Summoning.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.600
And Lulu would never do that.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.233
Why not?

00:14:33.233 --> 00:14:36.700
Get set for a move that's
a cut above the rest!

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.633
Since I sent Lazuli
to the graveyard,

00:14:39.633 --> 00:14:43.033
I can take one monster from my
graveyard and add it to my hand.

00:14:43.033 --> 00:14:46.566
Which means Gem‐Knight Lapis
is coming back for more action.

00:14:46.566 --> 00:14:49.000
And don't think I'm done
with my Fusion Summons!

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.166
I can get my
Gem‐Knight Fusion back

00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:54.166
by banishing a Gem‐Knight
monster from my graveyard.

00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:56.200
See ya later,
Gem‐Knight Lazuli.

00:14:58.333 --> 00:15:00.766
With it in my hand again,

00:15:00.766 --> 00:15:03.500
I activate
Gem‐Knight Fusion!

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.933
I fuse my Gem‐Knight
Alexandrite,

00:15:05.933 --> 00:15:09.000
Gem‐Knight Emerald
and Gem‐Knight Lapis!

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Magical rock
of dark and light.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Gleaming green knight
of good fortune.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.233
Lavender gem of wisdom!

00:15:15.233 --> 00:15:18.666
Combine your brilliance to forge
a blinding new brightness!

00:15:18.666 --> 00:15:21.266
I Fusion Summon,

00:15:21.266 --> 00:15:23.700
The mighty Gem‐Knight
Master Diamond!

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.233
(growls)

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.966
Oh, yeah! I almost
feel sorry for this guy.

00:15:30.966 --> 00:15:34.266
Julia's Fusion Summons
are gonna blow you away.

00:15:37.333 --> 00:15:39.433
(Yuto)
Fusion is the way
of our enemy.

00:15:39.433 --> 00:15:41.300
Anyone who uses it
is a danger.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.233
I just wanted to learn
to Fusion Summon

00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:44.566
to become a better duelist.

00:15:44.566 --> 00:15:46.700
To protect my school
and my friends.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.066
What's wrong with that?

00:15:48.066 --> 00:15:49.900
How's that
make me dangerous?

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.600
I got a few more surprises
up my sleeve.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.366
Gem‐Knight Master Diamond
gains 100 attack points

00:15:56.366 --> 00:15:58.966
for every Gem monster
in my graveyard.

00:15:58.966 --> 00:16:01.900
That's 300 more points
packed into Diamond's punch!

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.733
But that's not all
I've got for you.

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:09.666
Thanks to Lady Lapis Lazuli's
special ability,

00:16:09.666 --> 00:16:11.800
by sending another
Lady Lapis Lazuli

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.733
in my Extra Deck
to the graveyard,

00:16:13.733 --> 00:16:16.966
I can hit you for 100 points
of damage for every monster

00:16:16.966 --> 00:16:19.800
on the field that was summoned
from the Extra Deck!

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.733
There's six monsters
on the field!

00:16:21.733 --> 00:16:24.633
And Lapis Lazuli's
got 2400 attack points.

00:16:24.633 --> 00:16:26.433
(Julia)
Which means you're world

00:16:26.433 --> 00:16:28.000
is about
to get rocked!

00:16:29.966 --> 00:16:31.566
(explosion)

00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:34.800
Now finish him off!

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.666
Come on,
you can do it, Julia!

00:16:36.666 --> 00:16:40.100
This next move was taught to me
by Professor Marco.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.633
It'll teach you to never mess
with me and my friends again.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.200
This next move was taught to me
by Professor Marco.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.200
It'll teach you to never mess
with me and my friends again.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.433
By banishing Lapis Lazuli,
Gem‐Knight Master Diamond

00:16:59.433 --> 00:17:01.300
can absorb
its special abilities.

00:17:03.766 --> 00:17:05.433
That means Master Diamond

00:17:05.433 --> 00:17:08.133
can use Lapis Lazuli's
special ability!

00:17:08.133 --> 00:17:10.033
Just as before,

00:17:10.033 --> 00:17:12.800
I send another Lapis Lazuli
to the graveyard.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.533
Only this time, you're taking
100 points of damage

00:17:15.533 --> 00:17:17.466
for every monster
on our field,

00:17:17.466 --> 00:17:20.466
plus half of Master Diamond's
attack points!

00:17:20.466 --> 00:17:22.233
That'll do it!
Aw, yeah!

00:17:24.233 --> 00:17:26.366
I hope you all
enjoyed yourselves.

00:17:26.366 --> 00:17:27.400
I activate
a trap

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.566
from the graveyard!

00:17:28.566 --> 00:17:31.400
By banishing
Raidraptor‐Readiness

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.900
from my graveyard
and lowering

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.533
my life points to ten,

00:17:34.533 --> 00:17:38.600
I can block any damage
coming my way.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.533
Drat, he just
stopped the attack.

00:17:41.533 --> 00:17:43.900
But he's just hanging
on by a thread.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.400
One more attack
and he's done.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.100
That would be true
were it not for the fact

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.833
that with
Raidraptor‐Readiness

00:17:49.833 --> 00:17:52.200
I won't take any more damage
for the rest of this turn.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.033
Whoa, so then,
even if she attacks...

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:58.533
I can't beat him,
I end my turn.

00:17:58.533 --> 00:17:59.533
It's your move.

00:18:00.733 --> 00:18:02.566
(Shay)
As I suspected,

00:18:02.566 --> 00:18:05.633
you are but lambs
trying to fight a lion.

00:18:05.633 --> 00:18:07.066
You think so, huh?

00:18:07.066 --> 00:18:10.066
You talk big for someone
who's barely holding on.

00:18:10.066 --> 00:18:13.033
True, but then we are
always being pushed

00:18:13.033 --> 00:18:15.533
to the edge of defeat
by those who oppose us.

00:18:15.533 --> 00:18:17.300
What does that mean!?

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.133
Who knows with this guy.

00:18:19.133 --> 00:18:22.500
But in the end,
we rise up and we push back!

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.166
And it is our enemies who cower
and tremble with fear!

00:18:26.166 --> 00:18:29.200
It's my turn!

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.066
(shocked and worried groans)

00:18:31.066 --> 00:18:34.266
I now activate Dimension Xyz!

00:18:34.266 --> 00:18:36.733
Since I have less than
a thousand life points,

00:18:36.733 --> 00:18:37.900
and I have three copies

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.033
of the same monster
in the graveyard,

00:18:40.033 --> 00:18:43.800
I can use them to Xyz Summon.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.166
I overlay the three
Vanishing Lanius'!

00:18:47.166 --> 00:18:48.100
(explosion)

00:18:50.233 --> 00:18:53.866
From the shadows, the falcon
soars on wings of courage,

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:57.100
talons ready for the rebellion!

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.133
I Xyz Summon!

00:18:59.133 --> 00:19:02.200
Witness the assent of
Raidraptor‐Rise Falcon!

00:19:03.833 --> 00:19:05.733
(screeching)

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.533
Uh, just 100 attack points?

00:19:10.533 --> 00:19:12.100
(Shay)
Raidraptor‐Rise Falcon

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.366
can attack each
of your monsters once.

00:19:14.366 --> 00:19:16.700
Prepare for total destruction!

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.500
Total destruction?

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.833
That thing doesn't have
enough attack points

00:19:20.833 --> 00:19:22.533
to destroy anything.

00:19:22.533 --> 00:19:25.166
I am afraid you
are quite mistaken.

00:19:25.166 --> 00:19:27.600
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.033
it gains the attack points of
every monster on your field.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.833
(roaring)

00:19:41.366 --> 00:19:43.033
Is‐‐ I mean...

00:19:43.033 --> 00:19:45.033
Is that a‐‐
How can that...?

00:19:45.033 --> 00:19:46.233
No way.

00:19:46.233 --> 00:19:47.466
This is bad.

00:19:47.466 --> 00:19:50.433
(roaring)

00:19:50.433 --> 00:19:51.633
And now!

00:19:51.633 --> 00:19:54.966
Raidraptor‐Rise Falcon
will finish you all!

00:19:54.966 --> 00:19:57.400
Ravaging Rebellion!

00:20:01.933 --> 00:20:03.800
(explosion)

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.600
(all screaming)

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.400
(grunting)

00:20:11.866 --> 00:20:13.166
(grunting)

00:20:15.466 --> 00:20:17.933
(Yuto)
You say you're trying
to protect your friends?

00:20:17.933 --> 00:20:18.933
So are we.

00:20:18.933 --> 00:20:22.033
That is the reason
we fight.

00:20:22.033 --> 00:20:23.900
We're fighting
for our people,

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.266
for Lulu,

00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:28.300
for our friends.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.300
Because we must,
we have no choice.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.933
Zuzu, if you get
involved in this battle,

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:38.233
you have to do whatever
it takes to come out all right.

00:20:38.233 --> 00:20:40.866
Even if that means
you have to Fusion Summon.

00:20:40.866 --> 00:20:41.900
(gasps)

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.100
It might be the way
of our enemy.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.900
But I know that you are doing
it to protect your friends.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.000
I admire that.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
(gasps)

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.866
It's what we all must do.

00:20:51.866 --> 00:20:53.800
For a better world.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.933
And for a better tomorrow.

00:20:57.266 --> 00:20:58.400
You know,

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.733
you and Lulu
have a lot in common.

00:21:01.733 --> 00:21:03.400
Uh.
Hang on!

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.500
Lulu, who is she?

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.566
(whooshing)

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:08.366
(groaning)

00:21:08.366 --> 00:21:10.266
She's my colleague's sister.

00:21:10.266 --> 00:21:11.633
His name is Shay.

00:21:11.633 --> 00:21:12.766
What about you?

00:21:12.766 --> 00:21:14.100
I still don't
know your name.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.033
My name is... Yuto.

00:21:17.033 --> 00:21:18.633
Yuto?

00:21:18.633 --> 00:21:20.733

We've got you surrounded.
There's nowhere to run.

00:21:36.666 --> 00:21:39.333
(Shay)
Run? You don't
know me very well.

00:21:39.333 --> 00:21:41.533
I don't run
from hunting dogs.

00:21:41.533 --> 00:21:44.533
In fact, I was hoping
you would show up.

00:21:44.533 --> 00:21:46.733
Tell me,
where is your master?
