WEBVTT

00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.266
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.966
We will have three separate
matches between three duelists

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.766
from my school
and three from yours.

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.800
The one facing Yuya
will be Dipper.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.600
Bring it on, Dipper.
I'm ready for your very best!

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.833
(chuckles)

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:20.566
Observe, the mighty Rank Six
Constellar Ptolemy M7!

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.900
And now, it's show time!

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.833
Here they come!

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:33.066
First, I'll cast Stargazer
Magician in a starring role.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.266
And now for
the super‐starring role,

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:38.300
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:42.766
Pendulum Summoning...
what a sight.

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:46.700
Now, Stargazer Magician,
attack Pleiades!

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.066
Astronomy Attack!

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.366
And now for
the big finisher.

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:56.400
Trampolynx, attack Dipper
directly!

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.633
(Dipper)
Wait. No!

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:00.966
Aah!

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:04.266
(Yuya)
That's a wrap!

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.666

Yuya!
Huh?

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.633
(laughter)

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:15.066
You were wunderbar!
Yeah, Yuya!

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:16.766
Thanks, Frederick.

00:02:16.766 --> 00:02:17.733
Yeah!
Yes!

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:18.933
(all) High‐five.
High‐ten. High‐twenty!

00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:20.766
Yuya!

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:23.700
You did it! Your duelin'
made Gong happier

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.466
than Gong
on his birthday!

00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:27.733
Gong's never
been prouder!

00:02:27.733 --> 00:02:30.500
Okay, easy.
You're breaking my ribs!

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.600
Zuzu.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.800
(gasping)

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.166
(Frederick)
You're the best duelist
in the whole wide world!

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:40.166
(others chattering)

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:41.866
Uh, yes, Yuya?

00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:44.266
You're up next, Zuzu,
and we're counting on you.

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:47.733
Don't worry.
Just leave it to me.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.966
I know our whole school's
at stake...

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:53.066
so I know
I have to win this!

00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:58.233
You've allowed a student
from a third rate school

00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:00.300
to thoroughly humiliate you.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.066
And you've tarnished
the reputation

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:04.100
of the Leo Institute's
Xyz curriculum.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.133
Zuzu, just duel the way
you always do.

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:08.433
Right.
You'll win.

00:03:08.433 --> 00:03:13.133
That boy's Pendulum cards
will be mine one way or another.

00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:15.300
Begin the second duel.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.300
Yes, Madame Chairwoman.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.066
(all)
Huh?

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:24.800
My name is Julia Crystal
and I'm a Fusion Summoner.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.266
Huh. Well this battle
just got a lot more interesting.

00:03:34.366 --> 00:03:38.400
Do any one of you amateurs have
enough guts to go against me?

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.200
(Zuzu)
Yeah, I do!

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.133
You Show School's
on the line

00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:48.000
and so is
Yuya's reputation.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.633
I can't lose this duel.

00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:52.433
I just wish I knew for sure
who that was.

00:03:52.433 --> 00:03:53.366
(chuckling)

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:58.066
Ready?
(grunting)

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:03.000
The perfect setting

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.966
for my precious little jewel
would be...

00:04:04.966 --> 00:04:06.700
this one!

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.533
I activate the Action Field
Spell, Crystal Corridor!

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.633
(computer)
Augmented Reality
Combat System, energized.

00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:15.966
Generating Action Field.

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:27.700
Zuzu, this is the perfect field

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.966
to reflect your flawless,
sparkling skills!

00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:32.033
Time to twinkle
and shine, sweetie!

00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:33.866
This is so embarrassing.

00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:36.466
(snickering)
Your father may see you

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:39.266
as a sparkling little jewel,
but we know better, don't we?

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:41.633
What's that
supposed to mean?

00:04:41.633 --> 00:04:43.266
You're a fake, a liar,

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:45.266
too afraid to tell
the truth about your pal!

00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:46.300
(gasping)

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.866
You don't know
anything about me!

00:04:47.866 --> 00:04:50.433
Maybe not, but I know
a lot about jewels.

00:04:50.433 --> 00:04:52.066
My father is
a gem merchant

00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:54.433
and I've seen thousands
and thousands of them.

00:04:54.433 --> 00:04:56.100
I know how
real jewels shine.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.433
You don't have that shine.

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:03.033
Maybe you can fool
your father and your friends,

00:05:03.033 --> 00:05:05.333
but you can't
fool me, Zuzu.

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:07.566
Cause' I can see it
in your eyes,

00:05:07.566 --> 00:05:08.800
you're filled with doubt.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.133
(gasping)

00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:15.566
You can believe whatever
you want to believe!

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:17.300
The only way to really prove
what's in my heart

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.133
is to stop talking
and start dueling!

00:05:25.433 --> 00:05:28.766
Two star duelists are ready
to take center stage and battle.

00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:30.900
Their monsters are waitin'
in the wings

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.233
for their big entrance!

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.600
So without further ado...

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.066
It's on...

00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:38.966
with...
the show!

00:05:38.966 --> 00:05:42.433
(all)
So now we present,
the main event!

00:05:42.433 --> 00:05:44.366
(both)
Let's do this!

00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:47.966
(computer)
Action Cards dispersed.

00:05:47.966 --> 00:05:50.500
I'll go first, and I think
I'll start things off

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.266
by playing the spell card
Gem‐Knight Fusion!

00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:57.133
It lets me fuse together two
Gem‐Knight monsters in my hand.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.266
Already?

00:06:00.266 --> 00:06:02.400
That's right and now
I choose to fuse

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.100
my Gem‐Knight Tourmaline
and Gem‐Knight Emerald!

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.433
Stone warrior
in armor of lightning,

00:06:08.433 --> 00:06:10.600
gleaming green knight
of good fortune,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.566
meld your might to make
your light blinding bright!

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.166
Fusion Summon.

00:06:18.166 --> 00:06:21.100
Say hello
to Gem Knight Topaz!

00:06:24.066 --> 00:06:25.833
I can't believe
that she could

00:06:25.833 --> 00:06:28.766
Fusion Summon
on her very first turn.

00:06:28.766 --> 00:06:31.300
Well here's something else
you won't believe:

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.866
you don't stand
a chance of beating me

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:34.100
and saving your school!

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.666
(gasping)

00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:37.533
That's a lot of talk
coming from someone

00:06:37.533 --> 00:06:38.833
who brought out
a monster

00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:41.733
that's not going to be
very hard to beat.

00:06:41.733 --> 00:06:43.800
I wouldn't be
so sure of that.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.500
How you deal
with this monster

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.700
is going to make
or break you.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.733
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:06:51.733 --> 00:06:54.033
Well, we'll just see
who breaks!

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.900
I'll start things off
by activating

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.300
the sweet‐sounding spell
1st Movement Solo!

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.566
When there are no
monsters on my field,

00:07:03.566 --> 00:07:05.666
I can summon a level
four‐or‐below

00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:08.400
Melodious Diva
from my hand!

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.666
I present to you,
Aria, the Melodious Diva!

00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:19.433
And, with a Melodious Diva
monster on stage,

00:07:19.433 --> 00:07:21.833
this seriously talented
little songstress

00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:23.033
can make it a duet!

00:07:23.033 --> 00:07:25.900
Introducing Sonata,
the Melodious Diva!

00:07:27.733 --> 00:07:30.200
Time to face
the music, Julia!

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.733
(Divas singing)

00:07:33.733 --> 00:07:35.700
Now I'll tribute
this duet

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.000
and combine their melodies
to summon a whole new monster!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.633
She'll blow you away
with her musical talent...

00:07:41.633 --> 00:07:44.800
Mozarta,
the Melodious Maestra!

00:07:50.033 --> 00:07:51.833
(gasping)
She is a superstar!

00:07:51.833 --> 00:07:54.166
Yeah, she's Zuzu's
number one songstress!

00:07:54.166 --> 00:07:56.366
That's just the opening act!

00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:58.866
Once per turn,
Mozarta lets me summon

00:07:58.866 --> 00:08:01.833
a Melodious Diva
that's level four or below.

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:06.133
Give it up for the chart‐topping
melody maker...

00:08:06.133 --> 00:08:07.533
Canon the Melodious Diva!

00:08:09.166 --> 00:08:12.133
(Diva singing)

00:08:12.133 --> 00:08:13.600
Let's do this.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.733
Mozarta,
the Melodious Maestra,

00:08:15.733 --> 00:08:20.033
attack Julia's Gem‐Knight Topaz
with Graceful Wave!

00:08:28.233 --> 00:08:30.133
So, how'd you like
that performance?

00:08:30.133 --> 00:08:31.333
Ready for more?

00:08:32.466 --> 00:08:33.533
(chuckling)

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.100
All right Canon, you're in
the spotlight now.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.466
It's time to belt one out

00:08:40.466 --> 00:08:43.800
and attack Julia directly
with Singing Strike!

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.200
(Diva sings note)

00:08:48.533 --> 00:08:49.900
All right!

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.266
<i>Sehr gut!</i>

00:08:51.266 --> 00:08:53.566
Nice goin', Zuzu!

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:56.533
I'll admit that you may have
a little bit of skill,

00:08:56.533 --> 00:08:58.100
but nowhere enough
to beat me.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.200
I wouldn't be
so sure!

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.200
You would be
if you knew what I know

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.100
about what's going to happen
on my next turn.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.900
Then I'm gonna
change my tune

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.633
and switch Canon the Melodious
Diva into defense mode.

00:09:14.066 --> 00:09:15.600
My turn now!

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.900
I summon this gem of a monster,
Gem‐Knight Alexandrite!

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.200
And now, I activate
Alexandrite's special ability!

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.666
By sending this card
to the graveyard,

00:09:29.666 --> 00:09:32.166
I can summon one Gem‐Knight
from my deck.

00:09:32.166 --> 00:09:34.666
So I'm bringing out
Gem‐Knight Crystal.

00:09:37.133 --> 00:09:38.700
I hate to break it
to you, Julia,

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.633
but you can't beat
my Mozarta with that!

00:09:41.633 --> 00:09:42.633
(chuckling)

00:09:42.633 --> 00:09:44.633
Whoever said
I was going to?

00:09:44.633 --> 00:09:47.800
I activate the trap card
Fragment Fusion.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.133
By banishing monsters
in my graveyard,

00:09:50.133 --> 00:09:53.600
I can Fusion Summon
one Gem Knight.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.833
Oh!

00:09:54.833 --> 00:09:57.466
First she Fusion Summons
with monsters in her hand,

00:09:57.466 --> 00:09:59.866
now she's doing it with
monsters in her graveyard?

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:04.966
(Julia)
I banish Gem‐Knight Alexandrite,
Tourmaline and Emerald.

00:10:06.533 --> 00:10:09.800
That Julia seems to know
more about Fusion Summoning

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.233
than I thought she would,
but she's not nearly as good

00:10:12.233 --> 00:10:13.966
as this chocolaty
chocolate stick.

00:10:13.966 --> 00:10:17.100
Magical rock of dark
and light,

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.700
stone warrior
in armor of lightning,

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.166
gleaming green knight
of good fortune,

00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:25.766
combine your brilliance to forge
a blinding new brightness!

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.266
I Fusion Summon the mighty
Gem‐Knight, Master Diamond!

00:10:39.466 --> 00:10:42.933
My Gem‐Knight Master Diamond's
a cut above of the rest.

00:10:42.933 --> 00:10:44.400
(gasping)

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.600
Now I'll use Gem‐Knight
Master Diamond's special ability

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.866
to banish Gem‐Knight Topaz
from the graveyard.

00:10:51.866 --> 00:10:55.133
I don't... understand.
(Yuya) Zuzu!

00:10:55.133 --> 00:10:56.933
Don't let your guard down!

00:10:56.933 --> 00:10:59.266
She must have
something planned.

00:11:01.566 --> 00:11:03.900
What's the matter,
eyes playing tricks on you?

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.633
Ah!

00:11:05.633 --> 00:11:07.166
(Zuzu thinking)
What's going on?

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:08.466
Am I seeing things?

00:11:08.466 --> 00:11:11.333
Gem‐Knight Crystal,
use your brilliance

00:11:11.333 --> 00:11:14.200
and blast Zuzu's Canon,
the Melodious Diva!

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.333
Crystal Barrage!

00:11:18.533 --> 00:11:20.266
I'm just getting warmed up.

00:11:20.266 --> 00:11:22.500
Gem‐Knight Master Diamond,

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.700
shine bright and take out
her Melodious Maestra!

00:11:30.266 --> 00:11:33.600
She destroyed Zuzu's Maestra
like it was nothing.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.966
Well, she has lots
of life points left.

00:11:35.966 --> 00:11:37.166
(Julia)
Not for long!

00:11:37.166 --> 00:11:39.266
Wait, what do you mean?

00:11:39.266 --> 00:11:41.366
I'm sure you remember
how I activated

00:11:41.366 --> 00:11:43.533
Gem‐Knight Master Diamond's
special ability

00:11:43.533 --> 00:11:45.100
earlier in the duel,
don't you?

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.100
Well, unfortunately
for you, Zuzu,

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.533
by banishing my precious
Gem‐Knight Topaz,

00:11:49.533 --> 00:11:52.433
my Gem‐Knight Master Diamond
gains its special abilities

00:11:52.433 --> 00:11:54.733
to become
even more brilliant.

00:11:54.733 --> 00:11:58.266
Gem‐Knight Master Diamond has
Topaz's special abilities?

00:11:58.266 --> 00:12:00.000
Tough luck, girl.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.933
Ready for the bad news?

00:12:01.933 --> 00:12:04.200
Since Master Diamond
destroyed Mozarta,

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.000
you take damage equal
to Mozarta's attack points!

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.033
(roaring)
(grunting)

00:12:11.033 --> 00:12:15.000
Come on, Zuzu, get fired up!
Ya gotta beat her!

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.833
She just took
some major damage.

00:12:17.833 --> 00:12:20.000
But she's still got
some life points left.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.466
She can still pull it out.

00:12:21.466 --> 00:12:23.033
(Sora) In your dreams.
Huh?

00:12:25.766 --> 00:12:28.166
Zuzu doesn't have
a chance.

00:12:28.166 --> 00:12:30.833
(Julia)
Oh, I forgot to mention...

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:33.633
Master Diamond can attack
twice this turn!

00:12:33.633 --> 00:12:34.866
Poor Zuzu!

00:12:34.866 --> 00:12:36.600
If she takes another hit...

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.766
(all)
She'll lose for sure.

00:12:38.766 --> 00:12:40.966
I can almost taste
the defeat.

00:12:40.966 --> 00:12:42.733
(Zuzu thinking)
It's no use.

00:12:42.733 --> 00:12:44.433
One more attack
and it's over.

00:12:44.433 --> 00:12:47.466
There's nothing I can do...

00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:49.533
or is there?
(Julia) Ready, Zuzu?

00:12:49.533 --> 00:12:51.033
An Action Card!

00:12:51.033 --> 00:12:53.200
Thanks to Topaz's
special ability...

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.266
That's my chance!

00:12:54.266 --> 00:12:55.800
Gem‐Knight Master Diamond

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.866
can attack again,
so say good‐bye, Zuzu!

00:13:02.166 --> 00:13:04.266
I've got it!

00:13:04.266 --> 00:13:05.433
(grunting)

00:13:05.433 --> 00:13:06.666
Huh?

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.000
It's over there?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.100
Fooled by an image reflected
in the column.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.333
Your eyes may have
tricked you just now,

00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:19.000
but you won't trick me.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.766
I know Yuya was the one
who dueled Sylvio....

00:13:23.766 --> 00:13:26.133
Aah!

00:13:26.133 --> 00:13:27.733
(groaning)

00:13:39.833 --> 00:13:41.166
Boring.

00:13:41.166 --> 00:13:43.200
That's what I call
a total blowout.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.533
(chuckling)
That was no surprise.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.033
Zuzu. Zuzu.

00:13:49.033 --> 00:13:51.100
Zuzu!

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.966
(groaning weakly)

00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:55.666
I'm sorry about your duel.

00:13:55.666 --> 00:13:57.133
Yeah.

00:13:57.133 --> 00:13:58.200
I thought‐‐

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.533
(both grunting)

00:14:00.966 --> 00:14:03.266
Hey, you sure you're okay?

00:14:03.266 --> 00:14:05.500
(thinking)
I don't know
what's going on.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.266
I'm so confused
right now.

00:14:07.266 --> 00:14:08.533
My heart's telling me

00:14:08.533 --> 00:14:10.933
Yuya wasn't the one
that dueled Sylvio,

00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:13.300
but I know what I saw.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.766
Maybe my eyes
were playing tricks on me,

00:14:14.766 --> 00:14:17.133
like when I saw that card
in the reflection.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.433
Is this gonna be over
any time soon?

00:14:25.433 --> 00:14:26.700
Huh?

00:14:27.866 --> 00:14:28.900
Ah!

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.733
(groaning)

00:14:31.933 --> 00:14:33.333
What'd you do that for?

00:14:33.333 --> 00:14:34.866
I'm so sorry.

00:14:34.866 --> 00:14:37.666
Well, I forgive you,
but my back's not so sure.

00:14:37.666 --> 00:14:40.566
I'm sorry about
that duel, too.

00:14:40.566 --> 00:14:42.566
I know how important
it was...

00:14:42.566 --> 00:14:43.833
and I lost.

00:14:43.833 --> 00:14:45.733
Hey, lighten up, Zuzu.

00:14:45.733 --> 00:14:48.100
We just gotta win
the next one.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.800
Yeah.
(chuckling)

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.200
(Kit Blade)
Oh, is that all
you have to do?

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.266
(both)
Hmm?

00:14:53.266 --> 00:14:56.366
That should be
pretty impossible.

00:14:56.366 --> 00:14:57.500
Who are you?

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.133
The name's Kit Blade,
and I'm the slickest

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:01.056
Syncro Summoner
you'll ever meet!

00:15:01.056 --> 00:15:03.389
Now which one of you
do I get to beat?

00:15:08.889 --> 00:15:10.589
(Allie)
Yuya won his duel...

00:15:10.589 --> 00:15:12.522
(Frederick)
Und Zuzu lost hers.

00:15:12.522 --> 00:15:14.822
(Tate)
The next duel decides it.

00:15:14.822 --> 00:15:17.522
Oh, man, Gong wishes
he could get in there

00:15:17.522 --> 00:15:20.656
and get Gong some revenge
for how that kid treated Zuzu!

00:15:20.656 --> 00:15:22.689
But since Gong doesn't go
to You Show,

00:15:22.689 --> 00:15:25.022
Gong can't step up
to take down the competition.

00:15:25.022 --> 00:15:28.222
Listen, Sora, this is
a win‐or‐go home situation

00:15:28.222 --> 00:15:29.622
so you gotta beat him!

00:15:29.622 --> 00:15:31.956
I'm not really into
pressure situations like this,

00:15:31.956 --> 00:15:34.322
and I'm sure the competition
won't mind,

00:15:34.322 --> 00:15:36.189
so if you wanna duel
instead of me,

00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:37.689
I'm totally fine
with it, big brows.

00:15:37.689 --> 00:15:40.089
Huh! Big brows?
(bell dinging)

00:15:40.089 --> 00:15:42.222
Did you say I could duel
instead of you?

00:15:42.222 --> 00:15:43.856
Yeah.

00:15:43.856 --> 00:15:45.256
For some reason,
I'm not getting

00:15:45.256 --> 00:15:46.489
a good vibe
from that guy.

00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:49.289
(grunting)

00:15:49.289 --> 00:15:50.489
Huh.

00:15:50.489 --> 00:15:52.156
Then just leave him
to Gong.

00:15:52.156 --> 00:15:55.122
You know how much
this duel means, Gong.

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:57.556
But there's nobody else
I'd want or trust more

00:15:57.556 --> 00:16:00.089
to fight for our school
than my very best friend.

00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:03.056
Yuya...

00:16:03.056 --> 00:16:05.456
Now Gong's really fired up!

00:16:05.456 --> 00:16:07.789
Gong's hotter than a jalapeno
in a heat wave

00:16:07.789 --> 00:16:11.356
and Gong's gonna beat that guy
like a bass drum at homecoming!

00:16:11.356 --> 00:16:12.456
Hey!
Huh?

00:16:12.456 --> 00:16:14.222
I don't have all day,
big brows.

00:16:14.222 --> 00:16:16.222
If you're chicken,
save us both some time

00:16:16.222 --> 00:16:18.089
and get someone else
to duel, you got it?

00:16:18.089 --> 00:16:20.789
(grunting)
How dare you!

00:16:20.789 --> 00:16:22.889
Nobody calls the great
and powerful Gong a chicken

00:16:22.889 --> 00:16:24.222
and gets away with it!

00:16:24.222 --> 00:16:27.622
Gong'll show you
who's chicken.

00:16:27.622 --> 00:16:30.256
Now, let's get duelin'!

00:16:30.256 --> 00:16:33.022
If you think for one second
I'm gonna roll over and lose

00:16:33.022 --> 00:16:34.822
like the wannabes
who got beat before,

00:16:34.822 --> 00:16:36.722
grab a reality check,
big brows.

00:16:36.722 --> 00:16:38.122
(grunting)

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:41.622
See, I'm a totally different
kind of duelist.

00:16:41.622 --> 00:16:44.789
I actually know
what I'm doing!

00:16:44.789 --> 00:16:46.956
Do you hear what Kit
just said about us?

00:16:46.956 --> 00:16:49.522
He‐‐ he just said that
we don't know what we're doing!

00:16:49.522 --> 00:16:51.089
I hate to break
the news to you,

00:16:51.089 --> 00:16:52.756
but he wasn't talking
about us.

00:16:52.756 --> 00:16:54.022
He was talking about you.

00:16:57.622 --> 00:17:00.956
That Kit's got
a real sharp tongue.

00:17:00.956 --> 00:17:03.189
Sharp as a sword.

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:05.356
Hey, that's it!
(bell dinging)

00:17:05.356 --> 00:17:10.289
I activate the Action Field
Spell, Sword Cemetery!

00:17:10.289 --> 00:17:13.589
(computer)
Augmented Reality
Combat System energized.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:15.622
Generating Action Field.

00:17:21.022 --> 00:17:23.089
Gong, you know what field
this is,

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:26.722
and you know what you need
to do‐‐ bury his life points!

00:17:26.722 --> 00:17:29.322
Say what you will,
but if we win this duel,

00:17:29.322 --> 00:17:32.622
the You Show School
and its star pupil, Yuya Sakaki,

00:17:32.622 --> 00:17:35.522
will both belong
to the Leo Institute.

00:17:35.522 --> 00:17:37.922
Correct, Mr. Boyle?

00:17:37.922 --> 00:17:40.122
That's correct,
but if we win this duel

00:17:40.122 --> 00:17:42.889
then you promise never
to interfere with Yuya again!

00:17:42.889 --> 00:17:44.056
Right.

00:17:49.289 --> 00:17:52.922
(Skip)
The stage is set
and the duelists are ready!

00:17:52.922 --> 00:17:56.289
Their monsters are about to
bring this graveyard to life...

00:17:56.289 --> 00:17:58.456
In this tie‐breaking battle!

00:17:58.456 --> 00:18:02.389
The winner takes it all,
and the loser loses all.

00:18:02.389 --> 00:18:03.956
(both)
Action!

00:18:03.956 --> 00:18:04.678
(both)
Duel!

00:18:07.426 --> 00:18:09.059
Gong'll kick this off, Kit.

00:18:09.059 --> 00:18:13.159
Gong summons Superheavy
Samurai Kabuto from my hand.

00:18:21.759 --> 00:18:23.893
That's it... for now.

00:18:23.893 --> 00:18:26.959
Ha! A weak monster
with 1000 attack points,

00:18:26.959 --> 00:18:28.159
that's your big open?

00:18:28.159 --> 00:18:30.059
It's not
the monsters you use,

00:18:30.059 --> 00:18:31.759
it's how you use
your monsters.

00:18:31.759 --> 00:18:35.093
Ha! You're diggin' a hole
for yourself, big brows.

00:18:35.093 --> 00:18:37.126
My turn.
I draw.

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:39.493
(chuckling)

00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:41.226
I'll start off
this blowout

00:18:41.226 --> 00:18:42.793
with XX‐Saber
Boggart Knight!

00:18:49.193 --> 00:18:51.693
With big, bad Boggart
Knight in the yard,

00:18:51.693 --> 00:18:54.193
I get to summon
one level four or below

00:18:54.193 --> 00:18:55.659
X‐Saber from my hand.

00:18:55.659 --> 00:18:57.993
So I summon the level
three Tuner Monster,

00:18:57.993 --> 00:19:00.126
XX‐Saber Fulhelmknight!

00:19:01.659 --> 00:19:03.893
A Level 3 Tuner Monster.

00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:06.793
Gong activates Superheavy
Samurai Kabuto's

00:19:06.793 --> 00:19:08.293
special ability!

00:19:08.293 --> 00:19:09.893
Since you summoned
Fulhelmknight,

00:19:09.893 --> 00:19:12.459
Gong's Samurai switches
to defense mode,

00:19:12.459 --> 00:19:16.059
and it gains 500
defense points to boot!

00:19:16.059 --> 00:19:18.526
You out‐knighted yourself!

00:19:18.526 --> 00:19:20.259
If you hadn't summoned
that second one,

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:22.526
you could've beat
Gong's Samurai.

00:19:22.526 --> 00:19:24.059
You start playing cute

00:19:24.059 --> 00:19:26.126
and things are gonna
get ugly real fast.

00:19:26.126 --> 00:19:27.826
You keep that in mind.

00:19:27.826 --> 00:19:30.093
Nice goin', now hunker down
and wear 'em out

00:19:30.093 --> 00:19:32.126
with your heavy, strong
dueling technique!

00:19:32.126 --> 00:19:33.959
Ha! My skills
are so sharp

00:19:33.959 --> 00:19:35.226
you could never
wear'em down.

00:19:35.226 --> 00:19:37.459
I got a surprise
for you, genius.

00:19:37.459 --> 00:19:40.226
'Cause whenever I have two
or more X‐Saber monsters

00:19:40.226 --> 00:19:44.026
on my field, I get to summon
XX‐Saber Faultroll!

00:19:48.259 --> 00:19:51.059
Kit's already got three
monsters on his field!

00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:52.526
<i>Ach du lieber!</i>

00:19:52.526 --> 00:19:54.393
Check this out.

00:19:54.393 --> 00:19:57.893
Level three Fulhelmknight tunes
level four Boggart Knight!

00:20:11.259 --> 00:20:13.293
I Synchro Summon!

00:20:13.293 --> 00:20:15.159
Level seven X‐Saber Souza!

00:20:20.259 --> 00:20:22.326
Oh!
That guy looks nasty.

00:20:22.326 --> 00:20:24.593
So Kit added
a level three monster

00:20:24.593 --> 00:20:25.993
to a level four monster

00:20:25.993 --> 00:20:27.693
to summon a
level seven monster!

00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:29.759
You got it!
But there's a lot more.

00:20:29.759 --> 00:20:32.559
Once a turn, XX‐Saber Faultroll
can summon

00:20:32.559 --> 00:20:35.726
a Level four‐or‐below
X‐Saber from the graveyard.

00:20:40.226 --> 00:20:43.426
I'm calling out
XX‐Saber Fulhelmknight!

00:20:45.193 --> 00:20:47.626
Kit brought back the Tuner
he used to Synchro Summon,

00:20:47.626 --> 00:20:50.659
and I know he's got plans
to use it right here, right now!

00:20:50.659 --> 00:20:52.126
Then that must mean
Kit's gonna...

00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:54.759
Synchro Summon one more time!

00:20:54.759 --> 00:20:58.093
Level three Fulhelmknight tunes
level six Faultroll!

00:21:04.926 --> 00:21:06.359
I Synchro Summon!

00:21:06.359 --> 00:21:09.559
Level nine XX‐Saber Gottoms!

00:21:14.059 --> 00:21:16.526
(Yuya)
Gong's got his work
cut out for him,

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:18.359
'cause Kit looks ready
to slice and dice

00:21:18.359 --> 00:21:20.759
