00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:04.700
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh Arc‐V."

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.200
(Skip)
I knew you kids were talented,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.333
but who'd have guessed
you'd all qualify

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.133
for the
ARC League Championship?

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.200
All the top duel schools
will be represented

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.166
by their best and brightest,
including the Leo Institute!

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.200
But there will also be
incredible duelists

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.833
from across the globe!

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:22.066
(woman on loudspeaker)
First up, the Leo Institute
of Dueling!

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.233
Last year, Leo dominated
the championships

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.266
by winning
all three divisions.

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.566
(gasping)

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.866
That guy?

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.733
He's dueling
for Leo now?

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.900
You say you're willing
to duel me,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.666
but only if I enter
the championship?

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.000
Correct.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.300
That event will help us to
single out those duelists

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.866
who are the best
of the best

00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.333
to join my fight
against Leo Akaba.

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.166
You're battling
your father?

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.833
He's also
our common enemy,

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:52.000
and I will stop at nothing
to take him down.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.300
Okay,
wannabe champions,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.933
time to slot your competition
datacards into your Duel Disks!

00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:00.866
Now let's see
who I'm gonna duel first.

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.133
Sylvio?

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.300
My first opponent is...
Julia?

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.300
I duel tomorrow.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.700
Against someone
from the Leo Institute.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.066
Some guy named
Shay Obsidian.

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:11.966
Huh?

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.133
(Skip)
Attaboy, Frederick!

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:18.300
You just scored You Show's first
win of the championships!

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.133
(Yuya)
You were spectacular!

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.533
Aren't you next,
Allie?

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.800
Yeah!

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.200
It says my challenger

(excited chatter)

(Allie)
A few more shuffles for luck...

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.166
Perfect!

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:42.366
My deck is set and I'm ready
to rock the stadium!

00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:44.600
It sounds like Allie's
raring to go!

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.233
Ja, she saw me
win my duel

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:49.066
faster than a sports car
racing down zee autobahn

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:51.566
und now
she's pumped!

00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:53.766
Principal Boyle!

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:56.700
We're so excited to see our
little girl duel today!

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.733
(Skip)
I'm fired up as well!

00:02:57.733 --> 00:02:59.066
Your Allie has spunk!

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:01.833
Wow, I just got a great
shot of a squirrel!

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:04.133
Put that thing down and
say hi to Allie's teacher.

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:06.066
Nah, just make sure you
get plenty of footage

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:07.333
of Allie's duel.

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:09.333
This might be the start
of something big!

00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:11.433
With a win today, plus
her training at You Show,

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:12.766
I see Allie
blossoming

00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:15.733
into one of the world's
most famous dueltainers,

00:03:15.733 --> 00:03:17.300
So save
that video,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.833
'cause someday
it could be playing

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:20.700
in the Dueling
Hall of Fame!

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.766
Well, Allie's
already number one

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:25.533
in our family
hall of fame!

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:27.233
Hey! Sweetie‐pie!
Over here!

00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:29.100
Isn't she adorable?

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.133
Hi, sweetie.

00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:31.533
Oh,
you're gorgeous.

00:03:31.533 --> 00:03:32.666
Remember to smile!

00:03:34.733 --> 00:03:35.666
Chill out.

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:39.600
(woman on speaker)
Now let's head back
to Duel Court 3,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.033
where the tug‐of‐war
continuesin our Youth
Division!

00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:43.533
It's especially exciting

00:03:43.533 --> 00:03:45.466
since we have two new kids
on the court,

00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:46.733
Allie and Riley,

00:03:46.733 --> 00:03:49.366
who are both competing here
for the first time!

00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:51.933
I'm curious to see how this
matchup unfolds.

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:54.433
Their dueling styles are a
complete mystery to us!

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:57.066
I've heard, however, that
Riley is highly regarded

00:03:57.066 --> 00:03:59.966
by the staff
of the Leo Institute!

00:03:59.966 --> 00:04:01.566
The Leo Institute?

00:04:01.566 --> 00:04:05.066
All right, Allie, you can beat
that Leo kid, no sweat!

00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:08.366
Slam the lid down
on L‐I‐D!

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.566
Is she the cutest warrior
you've ever seen or what?

00:04:13.566 --> 00:04:16.333
Look at the fire in Allie's
eyes as she marches forward!

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:17.800
And Riley...

00:04:20.866 --> 00:04:23.000
It'll be okay.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.300
Feeling a bit nervous,
are we?

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.800
Mm.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.200
Aww, poor Riley.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.000
Must have stage fright.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.233
Or the kid's afraid
of the competition.

00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:33.400
Scared of Allie?

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.633
Seriously?

00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:38.033
When Allie has a temper tantrum,
she can be very scary.

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:40.900
(Allie's dad)
Aw, but even her temper
tantrums are cute.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.933
(Allie's mom)
She takes after
her mother that way.

00:04:42.933 --> 00:04:46.600
(woman on speaker)
Um, Riley...
Are you ready to begin?

00:04:57.366 --> 00:05:01.066
Do not disappoint me.

00:05:02.866 --> 00:05:04.633
Riley, hon?

00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:07.066
Can you hold
Beary?

00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:08.900
Beary?

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.600
Okay.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.800
All right, ready
when you are, Riley!

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.100
Go, Allie, go!
Go, Allie, go!

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.133
(woman on speaker)
Now it's time to reveal the
Action Field for this duel.

00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:20.833
It's the hot spot
known as Sun Valley!

00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:23.133
What a glorious locale
for a duel!

00:05:23.133 --> 00:05:24.600
<i>Our two young contenders</i>

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.800
couldn't have asked
for a more gorgeous field.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.733
(computer voice)
Augmented reality
combat system energized.

00:05:29.733 --> 00:05:31.466
<i>Generating Action Field.</i>

00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:38.933
This is going to be the most
action‐packed duel ever!

00:05:38.933 --> 00:05:40.633
Uh...

00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:43.400
I'm ready to duel
when you are.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.500
Awesome!

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.166
'Cause I can't wait
to wow this crowd!

00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:48.666
(giggling)

00:05:48.666 --> 00:05:51.000
I'm sure
you'll be great.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.133
Thank you,

00:05:52.133 --> 00:05:54.366
but a little enthusiasm
wouldn't hurt, you know?

00:05:54.366 --> 00:05:56.266
Ready?

00:05:56.266 --> 00:05:57.466
(both) Let's duel!

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.366
(computer voice)
<i>Action cards dispersed.</i>

00:06:00.366 --> 00:06:02.100
I get
the first turn!

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.333
So to start things off,

00:06:03.333 --> 00:06:05.833
I'm summoning a monster
who's pretty and pink!

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:07.666
Now, say hello

00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:11.866
to the fintastic
Aquaactress Guppy!

00:06:11.866 --> 00:06:14.266
Ohh...

00:06:14.266 --> 00:06:15.833
My poor little Guppy!

00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:18.566
The sun's way too harsh
for her delicate scales!

00:06:18.566 --> 00:06:21.566
If only I had a way
to make her more comfortable...

00:06:21.566 --> 00:06:23.666
Wait!
I've got just the thing!

00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:26.033
Aquarium Stage will set
the scene perfectly

00:06:26.033 --> 00:06:28.466
for my
Aquaactress!

00:06:30.366 --> 00:06:32.100
She'll feel right
at home.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.500
And she'll feel safe, too,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.200
because she can now only be
destroyed by Water monsters,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.866
and nothing else!

00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:39.800
(water bubbling)

00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:42.666
But I'm not done yet!

00:06:42.666 --> 00:06:46.600
What's an aquarium without
some fun fishy furnishings?

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.500
The spell Aquarium Set
will give my Aquaactress

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.766
the backdrop she needs
to shine!

00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:00.366
(exclaiming)

00:07:03.466 --> 00:07:05.733
Aquaactresses
just love this set,

00:07:05.733 --> 00:07:09.366
especially because it lifts up
their attack points by 600!

00:07:09.366 --> 00:07:11.333
Am I right,
my aquatic ally?

00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:14.066
All we need now is to shine
the spotlight on my Guppy,

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:16.666
so I'm activating
Aquarium Lighting!

00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:18.966
When you need to show your
Aquaactress at her best,

00:07:18.966 --> 00:07:20.366
this does the trick!

00:07:20.366 --> 00:07:24.200
It's flattering and doubles her
attack points when she battles!

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.033
My Guppy will now showcase
her amazing talents

00:07:27.033 --> 00:07:29.833
by attacking you
directly!

00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:31.066
(bell rings)

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.866
(buzzing)

00:07:34.866 --> 00:07:37.266
Error?
What did I do wrong?

00:07:40.933 --> 00:07:42.533
(buzzing)

00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:45.566
Error?
What did I do wrong?

00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:47.100
Oh, Allie!

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.300
Since you went first,

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.366
there's something
you can't do, remember?

00:07:51.766 --> 00:07:53.066
Oopsie!

00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:55.333
I forgot
I can't attack yet!

00:07:55.333 --> 00:07:59.066
Oh, she's even adorable
when she makes a mistake!

00:07:59.066 --> 00:08:00.100
Oh, brother!

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.700
She made the rookie
boo‐boo that time.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.400
It's okay, Allie!

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.333
You can always
attack next turn!

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:08.666
Stay in your zone!

00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:10.100
(giggling)

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.233
You set yourself up
perfectly!

00:08:15.233 --> 00:08:16.766
Stay calm
and duel on!

00:08:16.766 --> 00:08:18.833
Okey‐doke, teach!

00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:23.033
I'll put a card facedown
and end my turn!

00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:24.933
Guess I'll go.

00:08:24.933 --> 00:08:27.033
I draw.

00:08:30.633 --> 00:08:34.200
I activate the spell card
Shutter Layer 1.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.100
This card takes a snapshot
of your monster

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.166
and creates a copy
of that monster for me.

00:08:39.166 --> 00:08:43.066
But if your monster leaves the
field, I lose my copy as well.

00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:45.300
I must choose
a subject.

00:08:46.566 --> 00:08:49.633
Your Aquaactress Guppy
suits my purpose.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.266
Ah!

00:09:03.266 --> 00:09:04.466
Yay!

00:09:04.466 --> 00:09:06.966
My Guppy just got
an identical twin sister!

00:09:06.966 --> 00:09:10.766
(groaning)
I wouldn't be so happy
if I was Allie.

00:09:10.766 --> 00:09:12.800
Riley's got a monster
as powerful as hers.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.500
Ja,
this is trouble!

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.200
Due to your Aquarium Set,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.333
my Aquaactress Guppy
gains 600 attack points.

00:09:21.266 --> 00:09:23.933
I'll end my turn
with a facedown.

00:09:23.933 --> 00:09:25.866
It's your move.

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:27.166
Thank you, Riley!

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.166
Yippee!

00:09:30.166 --> 00:09:31.533
Perfect!

00:09:31.533 --> 00:09:33.033
This was one lucky draw,

00:09:33.033 --> 00:09:35.466
'cause we get to have
a fab fish fiesta!

00:09:35.466 --> 00:09:38.433
Time to make your entrance,
Aquaactress Tetra!

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.933
And just like her friend,
Aquaactress Guppy,

00:09:43.933 --> 00:09:47.833
Aquarium Set gives Tetra
600 extra attack points!

00:09:47.833 --> 00:09:50.233
At least she made
her fishies stronger.

00:09:50.233 --> 00:09:53.900
But not strong enough for
Tetra to beat Riley's Guppy.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.833
Looks like Allie's stuck
between a rock and a duel disk.

00:09:56.833 --> 00:09:58.800
If Allie attacks
with her own Guppy,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.933
both of their monsters'
attack points increase

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:03.000
because they're copies
of each other.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.100
Great, and they'll both be
destroyed!

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.000
Time for plan B!

00:10:09.533 --> 00:10:11.300
I'm gonna play
Go Fish!

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:16.133
So go, my fishy friend,
find me an Action Card!

00:10:18.966 --> 00:10:21.533
Now where is that
Action Card hiding?

00:10:21.533 --> 00:10:23.966
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

00:10:23.966 --> 00:10:26.133
Ooh, lookie lookie!

00:10:26.133 --> 00:10:28.733
My Tetra
and I found it!

00:10:30.033 --> 00:10:32.066
Now back
to battling!

00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:33.633
Are you ready,
Guppy?

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.433
Get set for some
fin‐to‐fin combat!

00:10:36.433 --> 00:10:38.500
Attack!

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.633
But before you strike,

00:10:39.633 --> 00:10:43.266
I'm activating the Action Spell
Sunshine Smile!

00:10:43.266 --> 00:10:45.933
But don't worry, these rays
won't dry out your scales,

00:10:45.933 --> 00:10:49.133
but they will give you
an extra 400 attack points!

00:10:49.133 --> 00:10:50.200
Great!

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.200
Allie found a way
to pump up her Guppy!

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.700
Good going,
Allie!

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.300
And my Aquarium Lighting will
make Guppy even stronger!

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.000
She has enough strength to
finish that fraud of a fish!

00:11:02.166 --> 00:11:04.233
All right,
ready, Guppy!

00:11:04.233 --> 00:11:05.900
Then spray away!

00:11:11.766 --> 00:11:17.300
And now, Tetra will join the fun
by striking Riley directly!

00:11:21.566 --> 00:11:22.966
Way to go!

00:11:22.966 --> 00:11:24.366
That's my girl!

00:11:24.366 --> 00:11:26.666
Hold that victory pose,
sweetie!

00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:28.333
Amazing,
am I right?

00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:30.966
We don't just crank out duelists
at the You Show School,

00:11:30.966 --> 00:11:32.766
we crank out
winners!

00:11:32.766 --> 00:11:34.266
For those of you
watching at home,

00:11:34.266 --> 00:11:37.966
You Show is currently accepting
applicants for immediate entry!

00:11:37.966 --> 00:11:39.533
Dad, save it!

00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:41.533
Aww,
what a letdown.

00:11:41.533 --> 00:11:43.466
That snapshot strategy
looked cool.

00:11:43.466 --> 00:11:46.100
But Riley didn't
use it very well.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.533
I hope everyone enjoyed
my Guppy's performance

00:11:48.533 --> 00:11:51.200
as much as we enjoyed
presenting it to you!

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.433
I can promise there's even
more excitement to come,

00:11:54.433 --> 00:11:56.700
but for now,
I'll end my turn.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.366
Think I'll end
my turn here, too.

00:11:59.366 --> 00:12:00.300
Later.

00:12:02.066 --> 00:12:03.266
Hey,
where you going?

00:12:03.266 --> 00:12:04.533
Duel's not over.

00:12:04.533 --> 00:12:06.500
I wanna go check out
some of the other battles.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.333
After all, somebody
from You Show

00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:11.600
needs to scout out
our competition!

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.300
Sora, wait!

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.466
My turn.

00:12:15.466 --> 00:12:17.300
I draw.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.533
To begin, I will activate
Shutter Layer 2.

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:24.500
This spell card not only
drains all the color away

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.700
from your side
of the field...

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.066
it also drains
the power

00:12:28.066 --> 00:12:31.233
that your spells gave
to your Aquaactresses.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.166
Oh, no!

00:12:37.166 --> 00:12:39.500
Now my fish will be
fried for sure!

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.400
Oh, no!

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.733
Our Aquarium needs
a new filter and quick!

00:12:49.833 --> 00:12:51.466
Guppy!
Tetra!

00:12:51.466 --> 00:12:52.466
What's wrong?

00:12:55.766 --> 00:13:01.166
For my next move, I now activate
another copy of Shutter Layer 1.

00:13:01.166 --> 00:13:03.000
There's two?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.433
I will use
this spell

00:13:04.433 --> 00:13:06.766
to take a snapshot
of your Aquaactress Guppy.

00:13:09.233 --> 00:13:13.033
Aquarium Set increases my
Guppy's attack points by 600.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.433
Wait!

00:13:16.433 --> 00:13:18.500
How can Riley use
Allie's Aquarium Set

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.333
when it's been
turned off?

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:22.666
Riley didn't turn it off
completely...

00:13:22.666 --> 00:13:24.600
Aquarium Set's
just turned off for Allie.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.866
(moaning)

00:13:25.866 --> 00:13:28.433
So my monsters can't get
stronger from my own spells,

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:30.200
but Riley's can?

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.800
Without those effects,
she's a sitting goose!

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.166
My Guppy will now
attack your Tetra.

00:13:42.866 --> 00:13:43.800
Allie!

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.066
It's gonna be okay,
Allie!

00:13:53.066 --> 00:13:55.166
Hang in there!
Fight back!

00:13:55.166 --> 00:13:56.966
You can still turn
the tables on that kid!

00:13:56.966 --> 00:13:57.933
We believe in you!

00:13:57.933 --> 00:13:59.033
Just keep smiling!

00:13:59.033 --> 00:14:01.300
Hang tough!
It's cool you're down,

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.733
'cause now you can
make a huge comeback!

00:14:03.733 --> 00:14:04.800
Don't you go
quitting!

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.600
They're right.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.966
I may be down, but that doesn't
mean I'm out of this duel!

00:14:10.966 --> 00:14:12.366
I'm a You Show
student!

00:14:12.366 --> 00:14:15.233
And when the going gets tough,
the tough get dueling!

00:14:15.233 --> 00:14:16.800
Watch out!

00:14:19.666 --> 00:14:21.133
(giggles)

00:14:21.133 --> 00:14:26.566
I'll tribute my lovely Guppy
to summon Aquaactress Arowana!

00:14:29.066 --> 00:14:32.966
Since your Aquaactress Guppy
is no longer on the field,

00:14:32.966 --> 00:14:36.266
my photographic copy
also vanishes.

00:14:41.033 --> 00:14:43.666
That fish is a whale!

00:14:43.666 --> 00:14:44.800
Perfect!

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.800
With one move,

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.533
Allie turned the tables
on that Leo kid

00:14:47.533 --> 00:14:49.700
and now
Riley's minus a monster!

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.533
It's time!

00:14:51.533 --> 00:14:55.166
Arowana, this is your cue
to strike at Riley directly!

00:14:55.166 --> 00:14:57.800
Ja!
Allie's taking
control now!

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.966
Your attack won't work.

00:14:59.966 --> 00:15:02.300
When you attack me
directly,

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.100
Instant Shutter quickly takes
a snapshot of your monster

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.133
and creates a copy
of that monster

00:15:07.133 --> 00:15:08.866
and summons it
to my field.

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:10.966
And due to the effect
of your Aquarium Set,

00:15:10.966 --> 00:15:14.066
my duplicate Arowana
gains 600 attack points.

00:15:14.066 --> 00:15:15.700
I have a trap
of my own!

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.033
And it's called
Aqua Story Urashima!

00:15:19.033 --> 00:15:22.500
I banish two Aquaactresses
to tell this tale!

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.633
Once upon a time,

00:15:23.633 --> 00:15:26.300
a duelist was taken
to an underwater palace,

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.366
where he was given a box that
was to be kept closed,

00:15:29.366 --> 00:15:30.666
but when he opened it,

00:15:30.666 --> 00:15:34.533
smoke billowed out,
turning the young duelist old.

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:38.233
Urashima's effect turns your
fresh fish into an old maid,

00:15:38.233 --> 00:15:42.900
lowering her attack points
to 100 permanently!

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.666
Now, this is your big moment,
Arowana!

00:15:45.666 --> 00:15:47.866
Attack
with Bubble Burst!

00:15:57.833 --> 00:15:59.800
That's the way
to come back, Allie!

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.800
Yeah!

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.800
I end my turn.
You're up!

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.200
It's my move then.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.666
I draw.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.666
(gasps)

00:16:23.933 --> 00:16:26.833
I summon CC Critical Eye
to the field!

00:16:32.233 --> 00:16:35.433
There goes the award
for freakiest monster!

00:16:35.433 --> 00:16:38.300
I gots the goosepickles,
but the bad kind!

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:43.333
I'm now going to activate
the spell card Montage Fusion.

00:16:43.333 --> 00:16:46.666
I will use the card's effect
to film your Arowana.

00:16:48.266 --> 00:16:51.066
My recording of Arowana
can then be fused

00:16:51.066 --> 00:16:53.200
with my CC Critical Eye.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.400
Riley can
Fusion Summon?

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.066
Conqueror of all
underwater realms,

00:16:58.066 --> 00:17:01.000
prepare to unleash your
destructive power!

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.000
I Fusion Summon!

00:17:07.066 --> 00:17:09.533
Now beware...

00:17:09.533 --> 00:17:12.666
For here comes the most fearful
armament of annihilation

00:17:12.666 --> 00:17:14.766
ever seen
beneath the waves...

00:17:14.766 --> 00:17:17.166
CCC Water Sword
of Battle!

00:17:19.533 --> 00:17:20.700
Ready?

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.433
Then take out
her Aquaactress Arowana!

00:17:26.233 --> 00:17:28.500
Auf wiedersehen, Arowana!

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.666
Allie will lose
a monster,

00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:31.433
but it's not
a total disaster.

00:17:31.433 --> 00:17:34.066
She has enough life points
to survive.

00:17:34.066 --> 00:17:37.100
When my Sword of Battle
swoops in for the attack,

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.700
its special ability
takes effect.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.200
It gains the attack points of
all the other water monsters

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.433
on this field!

00:17:43.933 --> 00:17:46.800
Man, this Riley's really
sinking Allie's chances!

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.666
The kid's pulling
a double whammy!

00:17:48.666 --> 00:17:51.900
Since Water Sword gains
Arowana's 2,000 attack points,

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.266
it now has enough
attack strength

00:17:53.266 --> 00:17:56.933
to wipe out the rest
of Allie's life points.

00:17:56.933 --> 00:17:58.533
And she can't stop it!

00:18:10.966 --> 00:18:12.600
Oh! Aah!

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.466
(sigh of relief)

00:18:31.133 --> 00:18:32.500
Don't worry,
folks!

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.666
Allie will bounce back
from this

00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:36.533
quicker than a kangaroo
on a trampoline!

00:18:38.166 --> 00:18:39.500
You okay?

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.233
I tried my hardest
to win.

00:18:43.233 --> 00:18:44.600
Honest.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.766
I'm really sorry.

00:18:47.766 --> 00:18:50.066
I let you all
down.

00:18:51.266 --> 00:18:53.066
Allie,

00:18:53.066 --> 00:18:54.700
you didn't let us down.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.033
We're proud of you!

00:18:57.033 --> 00:18:58.866
Don't beat yourself up,
okay?

00:18:58.866 --> 00:19:01.600
Keep fighting and before you
know it, you'll win.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.000
Yuya oughta know!

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.733
Gong can't even add up all
the duels Yuya lost to me

00:19:05.733 --> 00:19:08.900
before he finally lucked out
and beat Gong once or twice.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.200
Whadya mean,
I lucked out?

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.366
You couldn't stop my slick
skills and you know it!

00:19:13.366 --> 00:19:15.166
You just keep
thinking that, pal.

00:19:15.166 --> 00:19:16.866
Oh, yeah?
Prove it!

00:19:16.866 --> 00:19:18.200
Let's duel right now!

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.100
(all laughing)

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.566
<i>And now...</i>

00:19:25.566 --> 00:19:27.566
It's time for our exclusive
interview

00:19:27.566 --> 00:19:29.966
with the winner
of this afternoon's duel!

00:19:29.966 --> 00:19:33.700
Riley,
you must be thrilled!

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.300
Uh...
Don't be shy!

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.433
Tell our viewers
about your monsters.

00:19:48.066 --> 00:19:49.600
Great duel!

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.666
Your Fusion Summon
caught us all by surprise!

00:19:53.666 --> 00:19:54.700
Riley?

00:20:06.366 --> 00:20:08.100
You didn't disappoint.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.333
Good job.

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:11.600
Thank you.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.333
Losing any duel in the
tournament is bad enough,

00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:16.700
but losing to Leo
is the worst.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.966
Don't worry.

00:20:17.966 --> 00:20:20.566
I'll even the score with them
and that's a promise.

00:20:20.566 --> 00:20:24.600
I'm facing a Leo duelist
in the first round, too.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.533
When I'm done with Julia,
she'll be 0‐for‐1!

00:20:27.533 --> 00:20:30.833
You're a chip off
the old block, Zuzu!

00:20:30.833 --> 00:20:32.700
I can't wait to start
the cheerleading!

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.533
Well, then we better head
over to the center duel court

00:20:35.533 --> 00:20:36.733
for Zuzu's duel.

00:20:36.733 --> 00:20:38.733
Hold up.

00:20:38.733 --> 00:20:40.033
Where's Sora?

00:20:40.033 --> 00:20:41.100
He took off.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.200
I think he went to scope out
the other duels.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.833
Or the snack bar.

00:20:47.833 --> 00:20:49.900
Aw...

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.933
I didn't spot one duelist
in this whole tournament

00:20:52.933 --> 00:20:55.066
who's as entertaining
as Yuya.

00:20:55.066 --> 00:20:57.100
(signal ringing)

00:20:58.233 --> 00:21:00.566
I wonder what Zuzu wants?

00:21:00.566 --> 00:21:01.633
What's up?

00:21:01.633 --> 00:21:02.833
Sora!

00:21:02.833 --> 00:21:05.200
Hightail it to my duel
before it starts or else!

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.900
Sounds like somebody needs
a pre‐game pep talk!

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.633
