WEBVTT

00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.966
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:08.533
One more attack and it's over.
There's nothing I can do.

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:12.400
Say goodbye, Zuzu!

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.666
Aah!

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:23.466
It's now for our duelists to
learn who they will be facing

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.000
in their first matches.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.333
My first opponent is...
Julia!

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.666
My duel starts after
we wrap up here.

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:32.833
And then I'm up next!

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.500
So Fredrick,
Allie, and Zuzu

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.200
will represent the first
wave of team Yusho!

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.233
Oh! Aah!

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:44.666
(groaning)

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.033
I tried my hardest t' win.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:53.600
Honest.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.000
Allie...
we're proud of you!
Huh?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.266
Keep fighting and before
y' know it, you'll win.

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.833
Losing any duel in the
tournament is bad enough,

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:05.900
but losing to Leo
is the worst.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.300
Don't worry.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.233
I'll even the score with them
and that's a promise.

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:13.266
I'm facing a Leo duelist
in the first round, too.

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:17.200
When I'm done with Julia,
she'll be oh‐for‐one!

(Nico Smiley)
The ARC League Championship
is underway!

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:25.100
Gathered here are the world's
most talented young duelists,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.466
all battling feverishly

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:29.066
for the chance to become
divisional titleholders!

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:31.466
As our first round unfolds,
we've already witnessed

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:35.266
some stunning upsets,
but the best is yet to come!

00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:37.233
Break a deck, Zuzu!

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:39.933
Knock zah knockwurst
out of your opponent!

00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:42.666
Steal the spotlight, Zuzu!

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.833
(Zuzu)
I don't get it.

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:53.466
When Shay first showed up and
challenged Julia to a duel,

00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:56.833
she had no clue who he was.
But this morning...

00:02:56.833 --> 00:02:59.466
Shay's been at the
institute all year.

00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:01.833
He was in my Advanced
Dueling Linguistics class

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:03.200
last semester.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.033
(Zuzu)
Why has she suddenly
changed her tune?

00:03:07.466 --> 00:03:11.500
Hello, Zuzu. You planning
on losing to me again?

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.466
(groaning)

00:03:13.466 --> 00:03:15.366
Don't count on it,
Julia!

00:03:15.366 --> 00:03:17.866
I've been training hard
ever since you beat me,

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:20.233
and now I'm ready
to even the score!

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:22.433
I'm not the same duelist
as last time.

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:24.133
Be careful!

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:26.900
If you underestimate me,
you'll be sorry!

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.200
All right.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.300
I'll give you a chance
to prove yourself,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.933
even though I doubt
anything has changed.

00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:35.833
Our next bout
features two dueling damsels

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:39.466
as You Show's very own
bold and brassy Zuzu Boyle

00:03:39.466 --> 00:03:42.400
takes on
her rival Julia Krystal,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.666
representing
the Leo Institute!

00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:47.900
These tenacious teens are
determined to seize the moment,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.466
but there can be
only one winner!

00:03:51.466 --> 00:03:53.533
Yeah!
My daughter rules!

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:55.100
You show her who's boss!

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.566
Go, Zuzu!

00:03:58.633 --> 00:04:00.566
Huh?

00:04:02.633 --> 00:04:04.833
Hmm.

00:04:04.833 --> 00:04:07.300
(Nico Smiley)
Now, the Action Field for
this afternoon's slugfest

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.466
will be randomly selected
by the stadium ARC System!

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:15.666
And the lucky card is...
Oh, boy!

00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:18.033
Let's hope these girls
don't have vertigo, folks,

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:21.566
'cause this contest is about to
take them high in the sky!

00:04:21.566 --> 00:04:24.966
The system has selected
Infinite Bridges!

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:28.400
(computer voice)
Augmented reality
combat system energized.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.466
Generating Action Field.

00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:39.900
(Nico Smiley)
I don't know who designed
this crazy construction,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.600
but you can be sure nobody
checked the safety code

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.300
before they started building!

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.133
You'll need
some fearless footwork

00:04:46.133 --> 00:04:47.300
to keep from falling off
the walkways

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.600
and straight
out of this contest!

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.500
We've got plenty of altitude,
girls.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.866
Now show me
some intense attitude!

00:04:53.866 --> 00:04:55.666
You won our last duel,
Julia,

00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:57.533
but this time
you're going down!

00:04:57.533 --> 00:05:00.600
Not so fast, Zuzu.
You're the one taking a dive!

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.733
There's only one way
for us to settle this!

00:05:02.733 --> 00:05:05.966
(both)
By clobbering it out on
the court with our duel decks!

00:05:05.966 --> 00:05:07.633
Ready...

00:05:07.633 --> 00:05:09.433
Let's do this!

00:05:12.366 --> 00:05:14.033
(computer voice)
Action Cards dispersed.

00:05:14.033 --> 00:05:16.800
I'm up first,
and I'll start my onslaught

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.500
by activating the spell
Gem‐Knight Fusion!

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.300
It lets me fuse two Gem‐Knight
monsters in my hand together!

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.400
(Zuzu)
Julia's not wasting time.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.266
She's fusing right away,
just like in our last duel!

00:05:28.266 --> 00:05:29.866
Feast your eyes on this!

00:05:29.866 --> 00:05:34.600
I fuse Gem‐Knight Sapphire,
Crystal and my Garnet!

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.866
Now, watch!
My three Gem Knights

00:05:36.866 --> 00:05:39.966
will meld the blue glow of
power, the red fire of truth,

00:05:39.966 --> 00:05:41.733
and the silver gleam
of clarity,

00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:43.100
recombining their strengths

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.366
to make way for an even
more powerful monster!

00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:50.933
I fusion summon the mighty
Gem‐Knight Master Diamond!

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.966
Bringing out your heavy
hitter right away, huh?

00:06:00.966 --> 00:06:04.266
(chuckles)
It's a cut above the rest,
so why wouldn't I?

00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:06.400
Master Diamond gains
100 attack points

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.000
for every gem monster
in my graveyard.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.033
She's taking advantage of the
three knights she just fused.

00:06:12.033 --> 00:06:14.900
Gong sure hates to say it,
but that diamond's shinin'.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.233
With the help of
those three knights,

00:06:16.233 --> 00:06:20.600
Julia's master diamond
gains 300 attack points.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.633
Since my diamond's all polished
now, I'll let you take over.

00:06:24.633 --> 00:06:26.666
I've been hoping you'll show
a little improvement

00:06:26.666 --> 00:06:28.066
since our last duel.

00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:30.966
You'll probably disappoint me,
but try to keep this close.

00:06:30.966 --> 00:06:33.000
I'll do better than that!

00:06:35.266 --> 00:06:36.566
Hah!

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:42.100
I'll start off with a spell.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.133
Check it out.
Does it look familiar?

00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:46.833
Polymerization!?

00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:50.300
That's right. I'm going to
beat you at your own game!

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.433
I fuse Aria the Melodious
Diva with Sonata!

00:06:54.433 --> 00:06:56.533
This is your biggest
performance yet, ladies!

00:06:56.533 --> 00:07:01.033
Harmonize your voices 'til they
form a perfect musical blend!

00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:04.333
I fusion summon!

00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:08.433
Make your entrance, Schuberta
the Melodious Maestra!

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:16.100
That was
music to my ears!

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.866
Goose prickles!

00:07:17.866 --> 00:07:19.400
Bravo, Zuzu!

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.000
Use that creativity
to crush the competition!

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.133
I'm activating Schuberta's
special ability!

00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:27.033
Once per turn,
my Melodious Maestra

00:07:27.033 --> 00:07:28.566
can banish all the cards

00:07:28.566 --> 00:07:30.866
that were used to
summon a fusion monster!

00:07:30.866 --> 00:07:33.100
Huh?
And that means
your gem collection

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.033
is about to get
a lot smaller!

00:07:35.033 --> 00:07:38.266
You're gonna lose Sapphire,
Garnet, and Crystal,

00:07:38.266 --> 00:07:40.366
plus your precious spell
Gem‐Knight fusion

00:07:40.366 --> 00:07:42.033
will be vaporized, too!

00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:44.900
Chorus break!

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.766
Cool! Zuzu already
knocked 300 attack points

00:07:47.766 --> 00:07:50.800
off of Julia's Gem‐Knight
Master Diamond!

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.233
My Maestra will
also get stronger.

00:07:53.233 --> 00:07:55.333
She's gaining
200 attack points

00:07:55.333 --> 00:07:58.033
for each one of your
cards that was banished.

00:07:58.033 --> 00:08:00.400
I don't know what Zuzu ate
for breakfast this morning,

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.466
but I'm having some
before my next duel!

00:08:02.466 --> 00:08:04.633
She did even better
than you think.
Huh?

00:08:04.633 --> 00:08:07.833
Remember the spell card that
Julia used to fusion summon?

00:08:07.833 --> 00:08:10.366
Well, normally she'd be able
to return it to her hand

00:08:10.366 --> 00:08:13.500
and then use it to fusion summon
a monster over and over again.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.400
But thanks t' Zuzu,
she can't fusion anymore.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.733
(Sora)
If you think she's good, wait
'til you see me in action!

00:08:21.733 --> 00:08:24.000
Hold your ears,
'cause Schuberta

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.266
is about to unleash
her latest composition,

00:08:26.266 --> 00:08:28.133
and it's going to
rock your world!

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.433
Sonic surrender!

00:08:37.966 --> 00:08:39.600
Now that I
demolished your Diamond,

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.533
I place two cards
facedown and end my turn.

00:08:42.533 --> 00:08:44.533
That means my Maestra's
attack points

00:08:44.533 --> 00:08:47.066
drop back to 2,400,
but she'll be ready

00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:49.000
for anything
you throw her way.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.166
Go figure! That You Show
flunkie isn't half bad.

00:08:52.166 --> 00:08:54.500
She might be a diamond
in the rough.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.533
That was a one hit wonder!
I draw!

00:08:59.533 --> 00:09:01.966
Oh, it's so adorable
that you think

00:09:01.966 --> 00:09:04.000
you can go fusion
to fusion with me,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.433
but it's painfully clear you'll
never be on my level, Zuzu!

00:09:07.433 --> 00:09:08.933
That's right, Julia!

00:09:08.933 --> 00:09:11.866
I just made sure you can't
fusion summon anymore,

00:09:11.866 --> 00:09:15.100
so I'm not on your level,
I'm at the top looking down!

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.000
Oh, you're so naive.
Now, watch a master in action!

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.300
I activate brilliant fusion!

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.800
With this spell, I can fuse
monsters that are in my deck

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.566
in order to fusion summon
a new Gem‐Knight!

00:09:28.566 --> 00:09:30.966
You can fuse monsters
in your deck!?

00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:36.300
I take three Gem‐Knights...
Alexandrite, Emerald,

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.266
and Obsidian
and fuse my trio together!

00:09:39.266 --> 00:09:42.133
No way! Julia still found
a way to fusion summon!

00:09:42.133 --> 00:09:43.966
It's unreal
how nothing fazes her.

00:09:43.966 --> 00:09:47.200
Yeah! I wonder what other
tricks she's got up her deck?

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.333
Magical Rock of
Dark and Light,

00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:52.800
join the Gleaming Green
Knight of Good Fortune

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.166
and the Black Knight
of Chaos and Combat!

00:09:55.166 --> 00:09:59.433
Combine your brilliance to forge
a blinding new brightness!

00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:00.866
I fusion summon!

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:03.900
Now make way for...

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.400
the strongest and
most precious of my knights...

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.733
Gem‐Knight
Lady Brilliant Diamond!

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.333
Awesome! Now it's time
for Julia to shine!

00:10:14.333 --> 00:10:16.833
Unfortunately, when I use
brilliant fusion

00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:19.133
to bring out a monster,
my fusion monster's attack

00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:21.433
and defense points
drop to zero.

00:10:21.433 --> 00:10:24.733
Zero!?
But if I send a spell
card to the graveyard,

00:10:24.733 --> 00:10:27.466
its attack points return to
normal until my next turn,

00:10:27.466 --> 00:10:30.100
so I'd better find me one!

00:10:31.366 --> 00:10:33.700
What are they
having a race for?

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.233
T' get an action card!

00:10:35.233 --> 00:10:37.200
Julia needs t'
snag a action spell

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.800
or her Diamond's
gonna be worthless!

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.066
And if Zuzu wants to
win this duel,

00:10:41.066 --> 00:10:43.000
she better stop her!

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.033
(Zuzu)
That action card's mine,
Julia!

00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:51.633
And to make sure of that,
I'm playing the trap‐‐

00:10:51.633 --> 00:10:53.833
Musical Mayhem!

00:10:53.833 --> 00:10:56.433
This card'll give you a jolt
for 800 points of damage!

00:10:56.433 --> 00:10:59.400
By the time you recover,
I'll have that action card!

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.033
Aah!

00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:09.166
(Nico Smiley)
What a gymtastic move!

00:11:09.166 --> 00:11:12.500
This LID kid just put
the action in action card!

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.266
No wonder she's near
the top of her class!

00:11:14.266 --> 00:11:16.333
This action card's
a spell,

00:11:16.333 --> 00:11:17.800
and I send it
to the graveyard

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.200
so that
my brilliant Diamond

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.133
gets all her
attack points back!

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.200
Time to shine!

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.633
Unsheathe your sword
and silence Zuzu's Maestra!

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.200
Aah!

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.600
Zuzu!
(grunting)

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.066
(Nico Smiley)
Whoa, talk about a close call!

00:11:44.066 --> 00:11:45.700
Zuzu was one grab away

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.833
from taking the downtown express
to vanquished‐ville!

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:50.666
Julia had me worried
for a minute,

00:11:50.666 --> 00:11:53.333
but it looks like she's right
back in the swing o' things.

00:11:53.333 --> 00:11:55.300
(grunting)

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.200
You said you've been training
hard since our last duel,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.333
but from what I can tell,

00:11:59.333 --> 00:12:01.533
I'd say you need
a lot more practice!

00:12:01.533 --> 00:12:03.300
But feel free to try
and change my mind!

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.766
Oh, I will!

00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:07.933
(Zuzu)
If Julia keeps
picking up action cards,

00:12:07.933 --> 00:12:10.100
I'll be playing from behind
for the rest of the duel.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.333
I have to think
of a way to stop her!

00:12:12.333 --> 00:12:14.866
Aah!

00:12:14.866 --> 00:12:18.900
I'm placing a monster
facedown in a defense mode!

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.866
Really? You'll never
beat me by playing it safe.

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:24.600
(Zuzu)
You know what, Julia?
I'm not playing it safe.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.166
I think I know
what you're gonna do,

00:12:26.166 --> 00:12:28.566
but if I'm wrong,
it's over for me.

00:12:28.566 --> 00:12:32.166
I'm playing another facedown
and ending my turn.

00:12:32.166 --> 00:12:33.166
What?
What?

00:12:33.166 --> 00:12:34.700
That's all Zuzu could do?

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.600
No need t' fret,
Freddy, ol' boy!

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.666
Sure, Julia's got
some skills,

00:12:38.666 --> 00:12:41.866
but Zuzu's got one enormous
advantage over her.

00:12:41.866 --> 00:12:44.800
She learned to fusion summon
from the best‐‐ me!

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.033
It's my turn again!

00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:49.133
Due to brilliant
fusion's effect,

00:12:49.133 --> 00:12:52.000
my Brilliant Diamond's attack
points drop back to zero,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
but not for long.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.700
You need another action card,
but I'll get to it first!

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.700
Dream on, because
I'm summoning Crystal Rose!

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.900
And this flower can take
the place of another monster

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:10.666
when I fusion summon such
as Gem‐Knight Tourmaline!

00:13:10.666 --> 00:13:12.733
Brilliant Diamond,
now's the time

00:13:12.733 --> 00:13:14.433
to use
your special ability!

00:13:14.433 --> 00:13:20.133
It lets me fusion summon
by using only one monster!

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:22.466
You only need one
monster to fusion!?

00:13:22.466 --> 00:13:25.733
Yes. I'm outplaying you
on every level!

00:13:25.733 --> 00:13:28.066
I use Crystal Rose
to fusion summon

00:13:28.066 --> 00:13:31.800
one of my most
treasured monsters!

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.900
I fusion summon!

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.833
If you want to beat me
to that action card,

00:13:35.833 --> 00:13:40.100
you'll have to slip past
Gem‐Knight Zirconia!

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.566
Aw, perfect.
Not again!
(gasps)

00:13:47.566 --> 00:13:48.933
Julia's two for two!

00:13:48.933 --> 00:13:52.700
As you can see, I picked up
another action spell,

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.000
which I will now send
straight to the graveyard

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.400
to pump up my Diamond's
attack points!

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.766
It feels like we've been
to this movie before,

00:14:00.766 --> 00:14:02.600
and I definitely
did not like

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.500
how it ended
the last time I saw it!

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.033
Zirconia!
Take to the skies

00:14:07.033 --> 00:14:09.600
and take out Zuzu's
facedown monster!

00:14:15.766 --> 00:14:20.133
(groaning)

00:14:20.133 --> 00:14:25.000
So, how will you survive with
no monsters left to protect you?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.900
The answer is that you won't,
because my Lady Diamond

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.766
is now going to
attack you directly!

00:14:33.833 --> 00:14:34.833
(gasping)

00:14:38.066 --> 00:14:40.800
I activate a trap!
Fusion cycle!

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.366
This trap lets me
summon a monster

00:14:43.366 --> 00:14:45.933
that was used to fusion
summon in attack mode,

00:14:45.933 --> 00:14:49.533
and the best part is, I can
summon it from your graveyard!

00:14:49.533 --> 00:14:52.300
From my graveyard!?
Hmm!

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.833
And the card I want
is Crystal Rose!

00:14:55.833 --> 00:14:59.200
And this monster can't
be destroyed in battle!

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.166
It might be safe,
but your life points aren't.

00:15:02.166 --> 00:15:06.100
(groaning)

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:09.766
Don't bother getting up,

00:15:09.766 --> 00:15:12.033
'cause you're
down for the count!

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:19.933
(groaning)

00:15:19.933 --> 00:15:21.733
You caught a lucky break.

00:15:21.733 --> 00:15:24.100
You couldn't have used
fusion cycle to save yourself

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.800
if I didn't fusion summon.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.900
You're so lucky that I did.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:32.266
No, Julia, luck had
nothing to do with it!
Hmm?

00:15:32.266 --> 00:15:35.500
In fact, I outthought
and outplayed you!

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.233
I played fusion cycle
to protect myself

00:15:38.233 --> 00:15:40.466
because I knew you'd
try to end this duel

00:15:40.466 --> 00:15:42.066
with a fusion monster!

00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:43.333
You're so predictable.

00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:44.600
You played
right into my hands

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.766
and right out of
this championship!

00:15:47.766 --> 00:15:49.066
Don't flatter yourself.

00:15:49.066 --> 00:15:50.733
You make one lucky move
and think

00:15:50.733 --> 00:15:52.866
your skills make you
shine like a diamond?

00:15:52.866 --> 00:15:54.633
Your knowledge
about fusion summoning

00:15:54.633 --> 00:15:56.866
is as worthless as that
pathetic duel school of yours

00:15:56.866 --> 00:15:59.000
that hasn't entertained
anyone in ages.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.833
I'll prove you wrong,
starting here and now!

00:16:03.466 --> 00:16:06.566
You've been training so hard
with Sora, I couldn't imagine

00:16:06.566 --> 00:16:09.266
you not having this
for the championship!

00:16:09.266 --> 00:16:11.166
It might be
the way of our enemy,

00:16:11.166 --> 00:16:13.900
but I know that you are doing it
to protect your friends.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.600
I admire that.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.333
(Zuzu)
All the prep work
I did to help my friends

00:16:17.333 --> 00:16:21.033
will be for nothing unless
I make this draw count!

00:16:21.033 --> 00:16:26.900
I draw!

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.400
You might be thinking you
have the upper hand, Julia,

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.933
but this cards gonna you have
singing a new tune in no time!

00:16:32.933 --> 00:16:37.500
Soprano the Melodious
Songstress, take the stage!

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.666
Hmm.

00:16:38.666 --> 00:16:40.633
In a performance
you'll never forget,

00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:42.833
my Melodious Songstress's
special ability

00:16:42.833 --> 00:16:46.266
lets me fusion summon
without using polymerization!

00:16:46.266 --> 00:16:48.800
So that's why you
took my crystal rose!

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.133
Exactly! Because
I can substitute it

00:16:51.133 --> 00:16:53.100
for any monster
I want, and I choose

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.166
Mozarta
the Melodious Maestra!

00:16:55.166 --> 00:17:00.066
Gorgeous!
She totally created
a fabulous flowery fantasy!

00:17:00.066 --> 00:17:02.566
Soprano
the Melodious Songstress,

00:17:02.566 --> 00:17:04.233
this is your moment!

00:17:04.233 --> 00:17:08.733
Activate your special ability
and fuse with Crystal Rose!

00:17:08.733 --> 00:17:11.266
Together, you'll sing
a sensational duet

00:17:11.266 --> 00:17:14.700
that will form an even more
melodious monster!

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.433
I fusion summon!

00:17:16.433 --> 00:17:21.233

♪ Ah ♪

00:17:30.533 --> 00:17:34.000
Amazing! Zuzu's totally
nailing this performance!

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.233
I thought Julia had
this duel in the bag!

00:17:36.233 --> 00:17:39.433
She did, but Zuzu just
ripped a giant hole in it!

00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:41.733
It's time to belt
one out, Bloom Diva!

00:17:41.733 --> 00:17:44.366
Attack Gem‐Knight Zirconia!

00:17:44.366 --> 00:17:48.100
Wait! That fraulein doesn't have
enough attack points to win!

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.933
♪ Ah ♪

00:17:49.933 --> 00:17:53.233
(roaring)

00:17:53.233 --> 00:17:55.800
I forgot to mention
that when Brilliant Diamond

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.000
battles Zirconia, not only
is your monster destroyed

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.800
instead of mine, but you take
all the damage instead of me!

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.000
(gasping)
Vaporizing vocal!

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.033

00:18:11.166 --> 00:18:12.333
Amazing!

00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:14.266
Whoa, that was
cool times two!

00:18:14.266 --> 00:18:16.066
Ooh, yah!

00:18:16.066 --> 00:18:17.866
(groaning)

00:18:17.866 --> 00:18:20.100
That was a nifty move,
Zuzu,

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.666
but it's also going to
cost you big‐time!

00:18:22.666 --> 00:18:27.000
By destroying my knight,
you walked into a trap!

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.233
Thanks to Brilliant Spark,
you take damage

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:30.633
equal to the attack points

00:18:30.633 --> 00:18:34.400
of the Gem‐Knight
you just destroyed!

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.433
That'll inflict enough
damage t' wipe out

00:18:36.433 --> 00:18:37.866
all o' Zuzu's
life points!

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:40.200
Oh, no!
Zuzu, do something!

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.666
I'll spring my own trap...
Melodious Illusion!

00:18:43.666 --> 00:18:45.433
It negates your trap,

00:18:45.433 --> 00:18:47.933
plus it lets my
Bloom Diva attack again!

00:18:47.933 --> 00:18:50.933
Looks like this last number
will be your swan song,

00:18:50.933 --> 00:18:53.000
so enjoy it!

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.266
All right!
She has
the upper hand again!

00:18:55.266 --> 00:18:57.500
Or maybe not!

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.200
(Julia)
If I can get an action spell,
I can activate

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.600
Brilliant Spark's
additional effect

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.066
to stop Melodious Illusion!

00:19:04.066 --> 00:19:05.833
This action card
is all mine!

00:19:05.833 --> 00:19:07.233
I win, Zuzu!

00:19:07.233 --> 00:19:09.133
This is bad news for Zuzu!

00:19:09.133 --> 00:19:11.166
If Julia
gets that action spell,

00:19:11.166 --> 00:19:14.466
Zuzu can pack up her cards and
kiss this tournament goodbye!

00:19:14.466 --> 00:19:16.400
Almost there!

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.933
(grunting)

00:19:17.933 --> 00:19:20.000
I've got it!

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.166
What?
(Nico Smiley)
Whoa!

00:19:21.166 --> 00:19:23.500
I've heard of duelists
taking a dive,

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.133
but this takes the cake!

00:19:25.133 --> 00:19:27.266
Zuzu and her monster
have snatched victory

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:28.733
from certain defeat!

00:19:28.733 --> 00:19:30.966
That was nothing! We
practice moves like that

00:19:30.966 --> 00:19:32.566
all the time
at You Show!

00:19:32.566 --> 00:19:35.200
Are you nuts?! If your
Diva was a second late,

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.600
you would've been done for!

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.833
I knew my monster
would never let me down.

00:19:38.833 --> 00:19:40.733
And now, she's
gonna pick me up.

00:19:40.733 --> 00:19:44.333
Bloom Diva, I sense
another song coming on!

00:19:47.033 --> 00:19:48.333
Are you ready, Diva?

00:19:48.333 --> 00:19:50.333
Then blast
Brilliant Diamond!

00:19:50.333 --> 00:19:51.800
Wrecking refrain!

Bloom Diva?

00:20:08.466 --> 00:20:10.266
Why'd you catch me?

00:20:10.266 --> 00:20:12.300
I'm glad you're okay!

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.333

You saved me?

00:20:13.333 --> 00:20:14.566
Yeah.

(both sighing)

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.466
(Nico Smiley)
Folks, that duel was tighter
than the lid on a pickle jar!

00:20:23.466 --> 00:20:26.333
But in the end, Zuzu Boyle
of the You Show School

00:20:26.333 --> 00:20:27.866
won by an action card!

00:20:27.866 --> 00:20:29.366
(all)
Hurray for Zuzu!

00:20:29.366 --> 00:20:31.500
(crying)
I'm so proud of you!

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.333
You're a chip
off the ol' Boyle!

00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:34.766

00:20:34.766 --> 00:20:36.333
(laughter)

00:20:36.333 --> 00:20:39.666
Dad loves you!
Nice goin', Zuzu.

00:20:39.666 --> 00:20:41.633
That was my win, too!

00:20:41.633 --> 00:20:44.633
See what a great coach I am?

00:20:44.633 --> 00:20:46.600
Huh?
Hey, where did that guy go!?

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.933
Don't tell me he snuck out

00:20:47.933 --> 00:20:51.133
before seeing my
star pupil's big finish!?

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.000
Zuzu, I vas wunderstruck

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.666
when you fusion summoned
with Julia's card!

00:20:57.666 --> 00:21:00.066
Of course, she learned
that move from me,

00:21:00.066 --> 00:21:02.466
so I'm the one who
should be congratulated.

00:21:02.466 --> 00:21:05.833
(Julia)
Zuzu!
Huh?

00:21:05.833 --> 00:21:07.900
Hey, Julia.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.566
I hope you realize
there are going to be

00:21:10.566 --> 00:21:13.900
serious consequences
for what you did today!

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:14.900
Huh?

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.566
Since you defeated me...

00:21:18.566 --> 00:21:21.533
you are required to keep
your winning streak going!

00:21:21.533 --> 00:21:24.533
If you lose,
it makes me look bad!

00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:28.100
Here, Zuzu.
Take this.
(gasping)

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.000
Crystal Rose?

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.533
You're giving this
to me? But why?

00:21:33.533 --> 00:21:36.166
Huh!

00:21:36.166 --> 00:21:38.300
You'll be facing
some tough opponents,

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.200
so you'll need
all the help you can get.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.000
Always keep that card
in your deck.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.633
I'll be watching
your duels.

00:21:43.633 --> 00:21:45.700
I...
If you lose,

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.366
I'll come looking for you!
