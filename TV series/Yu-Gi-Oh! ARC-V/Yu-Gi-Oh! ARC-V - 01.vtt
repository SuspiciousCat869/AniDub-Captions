00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.666
Your duel‐taining
distracted me.

00:02:56.666 --> 00:02:58.200
You should take
life more seriously!

everything into a joke, Yuya?

Well, there's nothing wrong with
giving the fans a good laugh.

as part of the festivities

00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:11.700
he's issuing a one‐on‐one
dueling challenge to Yuya.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.133
You're inviting me
to duel The Sledgehammer?

I'm not inviting you to
duel his grandma!

Seriously, though,
it's your chance to make up

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.366
for your father's
disappearing act.

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:23.266

happened don't you?

This crowd's boiling over

Our Action Duel Championship
was supposed to get underway

00:04:32.366 --> 00:04:35.400
an hour ago, but Yusho Sakaki
still hasn't shown up

What a loser!

00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:44.733

He's scared of
The Sledgehammer!

My dad's no chicken!

Let me duel the Sledgehammer
'til my dad shows up!

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.266
Yuya, calm down, son!

00:04:50.266 --> 00:04:53.066
I'm not scared,
duel me instead!

00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:57.633
You're finally old enough
to get your wish!

00:04:57.633 --> 00:04:59.933

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.566
I won't let
Yuya be humiliated!

00:05:20.566 --> 00:05:24.466
The boy's suffered enough since
his father disappeared.

00:05:24.466 --> 00:05:26.433
Get out
of here, Nico!

00:05:26.433 --> 00:05:29.000
Oh hey,
I understand, Boyle!

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.500
It's a real shame though,
'cause if you had agreed,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.866

the castle walls

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.536
or toss your mother‐in‐law
in the dungeon!

00:08:14.436 --> 00:08:15.936
It's him!

00:08:15.936 --> 00:08:20.136
Guys and girls, presenting Leo
Institute's top Action Duelist

00:08:20.136 --> 00:08:21.836
and reigning
world champion.

00:08:21.836 --> 00:08:23.236
He's the biggest,
baddest bruiser

00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:24.703
<i>to ever pick up a deck...</i>

00:08:24.703 --> 00:08:26.536
<i>The Sledgehammer!</i>

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.203
His challenger is
a kid with a mission!

00:08:30.203 --> 00:08:34.203
Everybody give it up
for Yuya Sakaki!

00:08:34.203 --> 00:08:35.870
Yay, Yuya!

00:08:39.636 --> 00:08:42.370
Kid,
that's your cue!

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.436
The little guy ain't
even gonna show up.

00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:47.370
Yeah, he must be a scaredy
cat just like his old man.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.936
Guess the apple don't
fall far from the bush.

00:08:49.936 --> 00:08:51.036
Say what?

00:08:51.036 --> 00:08:52.303
Not now, Zuzu.

00:08:52.303 --> 00:08:54.470
But, Gong!

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.436
I was hoping if
I challenge the kid,

00:08:56.436 --> 00:08:58.703
his father would show up
for sure.

00:08:58.703 --> 00:09:02.070
I must defeat Yusho Sakaki
in a one‐on‐one duel

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.003
to prove I am deserving
to be the true champion!

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:06.336
Who is that?

00:09:06.336 --> 00:09:07.470
Beats me!

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.470
Oh!

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.703
Please tell me that
isn't who I think it is.

00:09:13.703 --> 00:09:15.703
(man)
Sledgehammer,
behind you!
What's wrong?

00:09:15.703 --> 00:09:16.870
(woman)
Turn around!

00:09:20.136 --> 00:09:21.270
Wait...

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.970
When did the circus
come to town?

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.103
It didn't.

00:09:24.103 --> 00:09:25.436
I'm your opponent!

00:09:25.436 --> 00:09:28.170
Do not tell me you
are the son of Yusho...

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.903
Yep, the one and only!

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:32.203
Well?

00:09:32.203 --> 00:09:34.203
Are you ready to get
this show on the road?

00:09:34.203 --> 00:09:36.236
Or, should I say,
on the castle!

00:09:36.236 --> 00:09:39.803
♪

For such a little clown,
you have a big mouth!

00:09:52.403 --> 00:09:55.870
You won't be so insolent once
The Sledgehammer squashes you!

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.570
It looks like sparks
are flying

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.570

even started dueling yet!

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.236

As we kick off this contest,

the whirlwind action will
leave you breathless!

00:10:15.736 --> 00:10:17.803
It'll be
the duel to end all duels!

00:10:17.803 --> 00:10:20.903
Only the toughest duelist will
survive this face‐off!

00:10:20.903 --> 00:10:23.003

Welcome to
the Yuya Spectacular!

00:10:50.336 --> 00:10:55.203
For my first move, I'm going to
make a spectacular getaway!

00:10:55.203 --> 00:10:56.470
What!?

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:57.435
And to help me
make my escape...

00:10:57.435 --> 00:11:00.701
I'll summon Performapal
Hip Hippo!

00:11:06.101 --> 00:11:09.168
Yo, Sledgehammer, why
don't you try and catch me!

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:11.968
They just started and he's
already taking off?

00:11:11.968 --> 00:11:13.368
The kid should
grow some wings,

00:11:13.368 --> 00:11:17.235
then he could fly away
like a real chicken.

00:11:17.235 --> 00:11:19.301
I knew letting
Yuya duel was a mistake.

00:11:19.301 --> 00:11:21.601
Yeah, but he's not dueling,
he's running away!

00:11:24.468 --> 00:11:26.701
So you want me
to catch you, kid?

00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:27.768
No problem!

00:11:32.201 --> 00:11:36.101
I activate the spell Feast
lf the Wild Level 5!

00:11:36.101 --> 00:11:38.468
This will get
the crowd crazy for more

00:11:38.468 --> 00:11:41.935
because it lets me summon
two battling behemoths!

00:11:41.935 --> 00:11:44.901
I summon Swamp Battleguard
and Lava Battleguard!

00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:51.768
I tribute you both right
away so I can summon your ruler!

00:11:51.768 --> 00:11:55.301
No forest can hide you or
castle can protect you

00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:58.001
from the chief of
all wild savages!

00:11:58.001 --> 00:12:01.001
All hail,
Battleguard King!

00:12:06.035 --> 00:12:07.835
(announcer)
The Sledgehammer
summoned a monster

00:12:07.835 --> 00:12:09.268
that's as mean
as he is!

00:12:09.268 --> 00:12:12.035
I wouldn't wanna be
in Yuya's clown shoes!

00:12:12.035 --> 00:12:15.601
Your father got away from me,
but you won't be so lucky!

00:12:15.601 --> 00:12:17.201
We will battle!

00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:19.901
Battleguard King,
bash that Hippo!

00:12:21.201 --> 00:12:23.701
Sorry, but we
have to get hopping!

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:26.568
I activate my Action
spell Evasion!

00:12:26.568 --> 00:12:28.101
Roll with it, Hippo!

00:12:28.101 --> 00:12:30.268
Why doesn't Yuya
stand and fight?

00:12:30.268 --> 00:12:31.401
He can't
keep avoiding‐‐

00:12:31.401 --> 00:12:33.901
(woman)
I wouldn't jump to
any conclusions.

00:12:35.368 --> 00:12:36.868
Yoko, hi!

00:12:36.868 --> 00:12:39.301
Yuya's running is
actually pretty cunning, Gong.

00:12:42.468 --> 00:12:44.968
That kid knows how to
use Action Cards all right,

00:12:44.968 --> 00:12:47.635
but only to help him stay
out of the action!

00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:50.468
I will force him
to battle me now!

00:12:50.468 --> 00:12:53.535
Battleguard King, loves nothing
more than a fight!

00:12:53.535 --> 00:12:55.935
So it can attack
twice in one turn!

00:12:55.935 --> 00:12:58.401
Eliminate that Hippo!

00:12:58.401 --> 00:13:00.301
No, not again!

00:13:03.335 --> 00:13:05.968
(Nico)
Whoa, that should wipe the
smile off that Hippo's face!

00:13:05.968 --> 00:13:08.668
Battleguard King took it
out with a single blow!

00:13:08.668 --> 00:13:10.401
<i>Wait, they're okay!</i>

00:13:10.401 --> 00:13:11.535
He survived?

00:13:11.535 --> 00:13:12.968
(Yuya)
<i>Yeah, but barely!</i>

00:13:12.968 --> 00:13:15.401
Just before Battleguard King
landed his blow,

00:13:15.401 --> 00:13:17.601
I activated
the Action Spell Miracle!

00:13:17.601 --> 00:13:21.801
It saved my Hippo's hide and
halved the damage I took!

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:23.035
I can't
believe my eyes!

00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:26.301
I gotta get my hands on
one of them hippos!

00:13:26.301 --> 00:13:27.535
Whatever.

00:13:27.535 --> 00:13:31.701
Battleguard King will
stomp out both of you next time.

00:13:31.701 --> 00:13:33.568
I guess Yuya's
not doing bad,

00:13:33.568 --> 00:13:35.568
but I still don't
see what he's up to.

00:13:35.568 --> 00:13:37.301
I think I do.

00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:40.301
For a long time, Yuya's been
treating everything like a joke.

00:13:40.301 --> 00:13:43.335
Clowning around was his way
of protecting himself.

00:13:43.335 --> 00:13:45.801
You see, Yuya felt that
people would look down on him

00:13:45.801 --> 00:13:47.335
because of his father.

00:13:47.335 --> 00:13:49.401
He idolized his dad.

00:13:49.401 --> 00:13:53.101
To Yuya, he wasn't just
a great duelist, but a hero.

00:13:53.101 --> 00:13:56.701
What do you say we
swing into action?

00:13:56.701 --> 00:13:59.601
Now Yuya has a chance
to be like his father...

00:13:59.601 --> 00:14:01.135
and prove he
was a hero.

00:14:01.135 --> 00:14:02.235
My turn again!

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:05.568
Aw, yeah!

00:14:07.835 --> 00:14:09.135
Your attention
please!

00:14:09.135 --> 00:14:11.635
My next move's
a real showstopper!

00:14:11.635 --> 00:14:15.101
As some of you may know, if I
tribute my Hip Hippo right now,

00:14:15.101 --> 00:14:17.968
it'll count
as two monsters!

00:14:17.968 --> 00:14:20.168
It's one of Hip Hippo's
favorite tricks!

00:14:20.168 --> 00:14:22.268
Go for it, buddy!

00:14:24.635 --> 00:14:27.768
Now put your hands together
and welcome...

00:14:27.768 --> 00:14:29.335
our main attraction!

00:14:29.335 --> 00:14:31.635
One of the wonders
of the dragon world,

00:14:31.635 --> 00:14:35.235
the spectacular
Odd‐Eyes Dragon!

00:14:38.735 --> 00:14:40.535
What do you say
we swing into action?

00:14:42.001 --> 00:14:43.235
Bravo!

00:14:43.235 --> 00:14:45.268
That's exactly what
his father used to say!

00:14:45.268 --> 00:14:47.501
The kid's a chip off
the ol' block!

00:14:47.501 --> 00:14:49.901
(Yuko)
You've been waiting
for this chance, Yuya.

00:14:49.901 --> 00:14:52.068
Make the most of it.

00:14:52.068 --> 00:14:55.201
I will teach you to fear
me just like your father did!

00:14:55.201 --> 00:14:57.101
My dad wasn't
scared o' you!

00:14:57.101 --> 00:14:58.268
Oh, yeah?

00:14:58.268 --> 00:14:59.968
He would've
beaten you easy!

00:14:59.968 --> 00:15:01.501
And I'll prove
it, too!

00:15:01.501 --> 00:15:05.301
By taking you down usingall
the moves my dad taught me!

00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:06.301
<i>Ha!</i>

00:15:06.301 --> 00:15:07.701
I see you cantalk
a tough game,

00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:09.501
but your monsterspack
no punch!

00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:13.101
Your Dragon cannot lay
aclaw on Battleguard King!

00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:15.101
But after I use
this spell here,

00:15:15.101 --> 00:15:17.035
it'll be a different
story!

00:15:17.035 --> 00:15:19.335
Wonder Balloons!

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:21.301
Whoa, this kid
has my toupee spinning!

00:15:21.301 --> 00:15:23.201
He must have
a nose for Action Cards

00:15:23.201 --> 00:15:26.368
cause he's finding them like
nobody's beeswax!

00:15:26.368 --> 00:15:30.768
Okay!
Wonder Balloons go!

00:15:30.768 --> 00:15:32.635
I got a balloon for
each Action Card

00:15:32.635 --> 00:15:35.901
that I found and
sent to my graveyard.

00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:38.435
Next, I'll be sending my spell
card Wonder Balloons

00:15:38.435 --> 00:15:39.735
to the graveyard,

00:15:39.735 --> 00:15:41.668
which will cause those
other balloons to burst,

00:15:41.668 --> 00:15:43.801
and each one drops your
monster's attack points

00:15:43.801 --> 00:15:46.301
by a thousand till
the end of this turn!

00:15:48.235 --> 00:15:50.668
Who'd of believed a few
balloons could be so dangerous?

00:15:50.668 --> 00:15:51.968
But they just let the air

00:15:51.968 --> 00:15:55.501
out of all your Battleguard
King's attack points!

00:15:55.501 --> 00:15:56.968
(Nico)
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

00:15:56.968 --> 00:16:00.468
Yuya just turned
Sledgehammers hero into a
zero!

00:16:00.468 --> 00:16:02.735
Now I see that you have been
playing games with me

00:16:02.735 --> 00:16:04.235
from the beginning!

00:16:04.235 --> 00:16:07.201
You just pretended to run away
to find as many Action Cards

00:16:07.201 --> 00:16:10.301
as your feeble
fragile fingers could pick!

00:16:10.301 --> 00:16:13.768
It was risky, but I knew
the duel would swing my way!

00:16:13.768 --> 00:16:15.101
He's amazing!

00:16:15.101 --> 00:16:16.768
The kid's hammering
The Hammer!

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:19.001
(crowd murmuring and cheering)

00:16:22.135 --> 00:16:23.801
(Yuya)
The crowd's got my back!

00:16:23.801 --> 00:16:25.435
They're all cheering
for me...

00:16:25.435 --> 00:16:28.301
just like they used to cheer
for my Dad during his duels!

00:16:30.068 --> 00:16:31.235
Okay, Odd‐Eyes!

00:16:31.235 --> 00:16:32.968
It's not enough
for us to win this,

00:16:32.968 --> 00:16:35.168
we've gotta win
with style!

00:16:35.168 --> 00:16:36.435
Hey, Sledgehammer!

00:16:36.435 --> 00:16:38.101
When Odd‐Eyes dethrones
your King,

00:16:38.101 --> 00:16:41.601
you take half its
attack points as damage!

00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:46.068
Half of Battleguard King's
original attack points

00:16:46.068 --> 00:16:47.801
equals 1,500.

00:16:47.801 --> 00:16:50.335
If I lose another
2,500 in damage,

00:16:50.335 --> 00:16:53.235
the total would
be catastrophic!

00:16:53.235 --> 00:16:55.168
I can end this duel
in one blast!

00:16:55.168 --> 00:16:57.468
Odd‐Eyes,
get set to strike!

00:16:57.468 --> 00:16:59.635
Take out Battleguard King!

00:16:59.635 --> 00:17:01.101
Spiral Flame!

00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:07.268
Yeah!
Bull's eye!

00:17:07.268 --> 00:17:08.401
Yuya!
Yuya!

00:17:08.401 --> 00:17:10.101
(cheering)

00:17:15.435 --> 00:17:16.868
(Sledgehammer)
Too little,
too late!

00:17:22.501 --> 00:17:26.201
(Sledgehammer)
Surprise, clown boy!

00:17:26.201 --> 00:17:27.801
I can't believe it!

00:17:32.268 --> 00:17:35.601
You're not the only one
who has a Miracle spell card.

00:17:35.601 --> 00:17:38.268
I was keeping this baby
handy just in case!

00:17:38.268 --> 00:17:40.035
(Nico)
Talk about
staying cool under fire!

00:17:40.035 --> 00:17:43.501
The Sledgehammer shows once
again why he's the champ!

00:17:43.501 --> 00:17:45.568
You pose no threat
to me, boy!

00:17:45.568 --> 00:17:48.868
Just like your father,
you are all show and no grit!

00:17:48.868 --> 00:17:50.108
And this trap is going
to prove it!

00:17:50.108 --> 00:17:51.808
Since I took damage,

00:17:51.808 --> 00:17:56.642
Battleguard Rage inflates
its attack points by 2,000!

00:17:56.642 --> 00:17:58.242
I... end my turn.

00:17:58.242 --> 00:18:01.175
(Nico)
Battleguard King now
bursts out of those balloons!

00:18:01.175 --> 00:18:05.042
The King of savages is
stronger than ever!

00:18:05.042 --> 00:18:06.908
Yuya and his Odd‐Eyes
better do something quick

00:18:06.908 --> 00:18:10.575
or he's gonna be
the odd man out!

00:18:10.575 --> 00:18:13.308
Now I have the upper
hand, my little friend.

00:18:13.308 --> 00:18:16.275
And I'm going to use
it to crush you!

00:18:16.275 --> 00:18:17.375
No!

00:18:17.375 --> 00:18:19.008
You won't escape!

00:18:19.008 --> 00:18:22.342
Battleguard King,
destroy his Odd‐Eyes!

00:18:22.342 --> 00:18:23.342
Ah!

00:18:23.342 --> 00:18:24.342
An Action Card!

00:18:32.408 --> 00:18:35.875
Because of Battleguard Rage's
effect, your Dragon goes back

00:18:35.875 --> 00:18:39.008
to your hand instead
of the graveyard.

00:18:39.008 --> 00:18:42.808
Watch how a winner duels
as I wield Battleguard Magic!

00:18:42.808 --> 00:18:45.875
It will pump me back up with
life points as it deflates

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:49.008
any chances you had
of winning this duel!

00:18:49.008 --> 00:18:51.675
Could this get
any worse?

00:18:51.675 --> 00:18:53.008
Luckily for you,

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:55.308
my Battleguard King
cannot attack again

00:18:55.308 --> 00:18:56.208
this turn.

00:18:56.208 --> 00:18:57.975
You'll
survive for now.

00:18:57.975 --> 00:19:02.108
But I promise this, you
won't last long.

00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:05.042
It is useless,
but go ahead and draw.

00:19:05.042 --> 00:19:08.042
Maybe you should pull a
disappearing act, kid.

00:19:08.042 --> 00:19:10.275
After all,
like father, like son!

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:12.008
No thanks!
I'm staying‐‐

00:19:14.275 --> 00:19:15.275
(Yuya)
Who am I kidding?

00:19:15.275 --> 00:19:16.642
It's hopeless.

00:19:16.642 --> 00:19:18.842
I don't have the cards or
the skills to pull this out.

00:19:18.842 --> 00:19:21.108
Maybe I should pull
a vanishing act...

00:19:21.108 --> 00:19:23.808
After all, I'm not
the duel‐tianer my dad was

00:19:23.808 --> 00:19:25.442
and I never will be.

00:19:25.442 --> 00:19:26.975
(Yusho's voice)
When things get tough...

00:19:26.975 --> 00:19:28.408
Try to laugh when you
feel like crying...

00:19:28.408 --> 00:19:29.942
Don't worry
about anything...

00:19:29.942 --> 00:19:31.875
If the pendulum
swings one way,

00:19:31.875 --> 00:19:34.008
you know it will
swing the other way, too.

00:19:34.008 --> 00:19:36.042
Try to remember what
I've told you...

00:19:36.042 --> 00:19:38.308
It's time to
swing into action!

00:19:38.308 --> 00:19:41.108
Okay, pendulum,
you swung his way.

00:19:41.108 --> 00:19:43.942
Now you'll swing
my way!

00:19:58.042 --> 00:20:01.142
I'll use Stargazer Magician
and Timegazer Magician

00:20:01.142 --> 00:20:02.642
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:20:02.642 --> 00:20:05.508
I'm taking control
of this duel starting now!

00:20:19.875 --> 00:20:22.542
I'm allowed to summon monsters
from level two through seven

00:20:22.542 --> 00:20:24.575
all at the same time!

00:20:24.575 --> 00:20:26.342
What's
that kid doing?

00:20:26.342 --> 00:20:28.208
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:20:28.208 --> 00:20:30.308
Carve the arc
of victory!

00:20:32.342 --> 00:20:36.075
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:20:48.308 --> 00:20:49.942
How'd he
do that?

00:20:49.942 --> 00:20:51.275
Got Gong!
