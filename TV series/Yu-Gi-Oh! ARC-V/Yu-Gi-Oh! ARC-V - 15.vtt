(Yuya)
Previously on
"YuGiOh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Mr. President!
At precisely 5:54 p. m.,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.700
our systems detected
a powerful summoning.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.900
And the summoning
method?

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.466
It was Xyz.

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.000
I want every resource
we've got dedicated

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.133
to finding out
what happened to Marco.

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.166
(Skip)
I get it, Yuya,
you thought

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.933
Pendulum Summoning
was your special deal,

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.200
and now someone else
comes along

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.733
and Pendulum Summons,
and it's throwing you off.

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.266
This is so unfair.

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.933
What are you going
to do about it?

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.833
Run away like always?

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.366
Not on my watch!

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.966
You and me are
dueling!

00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.133
(voice)
<i>Generating Action Field.</i>

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.800
My dad's field.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.500
That's right!
There hasn't been

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.233
a dueltainer
before or since

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:44.633
that could keep
a crowd on its feet

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:45.866
like your old man.

00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:49.333
Except it wasn't
like that at first,
ya know.

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.500
Huh?
When other duelists
started Action Dueling,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.966
your dad didn't freak out
and pout about it.

00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.033
He just kept
having a good time.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:00.200
You opened the door
to Pendulum Summoning!

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.633
You can keep feeling
sorry for yourself.

00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:05.500
Or you could
be the example

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.933
for everyone
to follow.

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.800
My dad wouldn't feel
sorry for himself‐‐

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.833
I won't either.

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.500
You're right.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.366
I can't run away
from my problems.

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:19.900
I gotta face them
head on.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.533
And just like my dad,
I'll try to be

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.466
an inspiration for
duelists everywhere.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.633

(Yuya)
Hey, Dad,
how's it going?

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:36.200
So, I'm gonna do it.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.600
I'm gonna sharpen
my duel skills

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.400
and become
a pro like you.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.933
I'll entertain people

00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:43.200
while chewing up
the competition!

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.000
Just because
it's seafood

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.633
doesn't mean I want
to see your food.

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:53.200
(Sylvio)
Handkerchief?

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:56.033
Hi.

00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:59.233
Go away, Sylvio.

00:02:59.233 --> 00:03:01.133
You know, Yuya,
I must say that

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:02.766
your table manners
are about as elegant

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:03.933
as your dueling.

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.366
That is to say,
not at all.

00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:06.633
Says you.

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:08.200
Now, did you
want something,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.166
or are you just here
to annoy us?

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:13.300
Hmph, another duelist got
ambushed yesterday.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.233
People are saying
you're the culprit.

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:16.266
(both gasp)

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:18.000
Then some people
are wrong!

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.100
So... who was attacked?

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.833
Professor Marco.

00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:24.200
He's a teacher at
the Leo Institute.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.600
No one has heard
from him since.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.100
(both gasp)

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.000
We have to tell him!

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.366
Wait!
Where are you going?

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:33.966
We'll finish this
some other time.

00:03:33.966 --> 00:03:37.133
That must be why
Declan suddenly took off.

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:39.933
You seem genuinely
surprised to hear this.

00:03:39.933 --> 00:03:42.400
I had a feeling the rumors
about you being involved

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.600
were wrong.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.033
There's no way
someone like you

00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:46.866
could get the best
of someone like Marco,

00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:49.633
even with your cheap
Pendulum Summoning.

00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:51.066
Hang on!

00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:54.100
What's so cheap about
Pendulum Summoning?

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.400
Well for starters,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.933
you're the only one with
Pendulum Cards.

00:03:57.933 --> 00:03:59.533
How is that fair?

00:03:59.533 --> 00:04:01.066
Huh?

00:04:01.066 --> 00:04:04.066
Anyway, that'll
all change soon.

00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:05.466
I hear
the Leo Corporation

00:04:05.466 --> 00:04:07.200
is starting
to independently develop

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.933
Pendulum Cards now.

00:04:08.933 --> 00:04:11.566
I'll be the first in line
when they release.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.833
And then you and I are
going to settle things.

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:17.466
I'd say we could
settle it

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:19.200
in the Junior Arc
League Championship,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.300
but we can't‐‐ you aren't
qualified to enter.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.800
Not qualified to enter?

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.766
Whoa!
He's totally right!

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:29.766
How am I supposed to become
a pro now?

00:04:29.766 --> 00:04:31.166
(pigs grunt)

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:35.600
Hey, guys!

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.366
Our study group was
canceled.

00:04:37.366 --> 00:04:38.866
We're going
to You Show!

00:04:38.866 --> 00:04:41.233
You guys wanna
come with?

00:04:41.233 --> 00:04:44.400
(groaning)

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.033
Yuya...
is something wrong?

00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:48.600
(Frederick)
You cannot enter

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.833
the Junior Arc
League Championship?

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:52.366
Not this year.

00:04:52.366 --> 00:04:54.866
In order to be able
to qualify and register,

00:04:54.866 --> 00:04:56.733
your yearly record has
to show a minimum

00:04:56.733 --> 00:04:59.100
of 50 Junior Arc
League‐sanctioned duels

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.966
with at least
a 60% win rate.

00:05:01.966 --> 00:05:04.500
So what does your
yearly record show?

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.400
46 duels, 26 wins.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.633
Let's see.
26 divided by 46...

00:05:10.633 --> 00:05:13.666
That's 56.5...

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:15.066
That's not quite
good enough.

00:05:15.066 --> 00:05:17.433
You're like
a human calculator!

00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:19.833
But if you've
only dueled 46 times,

00:05:19.833 --> 00:05:22.166
you still need four more
to get to 50,

00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:24.066
and if you win
all four of those duels,

00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:25.266
you'll have 30 wins,

00:05:25.266 --> 00:05:27.433
which is exactly
60 percent.

00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:29.500
That's what
I told him.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.200
So we went around school

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.100
to see if anyone
wanted to duel him,

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.433
but, um...

00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:36.200
(student)
No way!

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.400
I'm not gonna
duel someone

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.266
who can battle
with Pendulum power!

00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:41.200
(second student)
Battle the guy who
beat the Sledgehammer

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.433
and took away
his title?

00:05:42.433 --> 00:05:44.933
Thanks,
but no thanks.

00:05:44.933 --> 00:05:46.266
(third student)
Gotta go,
but can't you enter

00:05:46.266 --> 00:05:47.833
any competition
you like?

00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:50.366
Don't pros like you get
a free pass or something?

00:05:50.366 --> 00:05:52.566
I'm not getting
a free pass!

00:05:52.566 --> 00:05:54.800
People just don't get it.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.900
The Sledgehammer duel
wasn't for his title,

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.333
so winning
didn't make me a pro.

00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:01.666
And to be a pro,
you gotta do well

00:06:01.666 --> 00:06:03.300
in the Junior
Championship.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.400
Unt then there is
the Qualification Test

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.366
to enter the Senior
Arc League.

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:08.700
And then you need
enough wins there

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.100
to take the Pro Test.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.100
I've got a protest
for ya!

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.433
Everyone
thinks I'm a pro,

00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:15.300
but I can't actually
become a pro

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.566
until I qualify,

00:06:16.566 --> 00:06:19.133
and I can't qualify
because no one will duel me

00:06:19.133 --> 00:06:21.166
because everyone thinks
I'm a pro!

00:06:21.166 --> 00:06:23.666
Oh... You said I need

00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:25.366
four more duels,
right?

00:06:25.366 --> 00:06:26.833
(chuckling)

00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:28.766
Forget it.
No way!

00:06:28.766 --> 00:06:30.733
Why not?
We're in
elementary school,

00:06:30.733 --> 00:06:32.833
so we're in the Youth
Arc League.

00:06:32.833 --> 00:06:35.200
You need to duel
four Junior Arc Leaguers.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.566
Right, Junior
Arc Leaguers...

00:06:37.566 --> 00:06:38.900
Like Zuzu!

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.666
Not gonna happen,
Yuya.

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:42.100
Why not?

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.700
'Cause right now
I'm sitting at

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.400
exactly 60 percent.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.100
No way am I gonna
throw that away

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.466
by losing to you.

00:06:48.466 --> 00:06:49.600
There's no point.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.200
Well, then who am I
supposed to duel?

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.900
Why don't you go
talk to Gong about it?

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.566
He's the reason
you're even close

00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:58.966
to the required
50 matches this year,

00:06:58.966 --> 00:07:01.400
all the tips and pointers
he's thrown your way...

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.466
Not to mention
all the Dojo students

00:07:03.466 --> 00:07:05.466
he let you battle
from his school.

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:08.366
I'm grateful for
all of the help
Gong's given.

00:07:08.366 --> 00:07:10.466
If it wasn't for Gong's
training and support,

00:07:10.466 --> 00:07:12.800
I mighta lost
my duel against Dipper,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.166
and then,
after Zuzu lost,

00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:16.500
and our backs were
really against the wall,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.700
Gong stepped up and managed
to keep our school safe

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.633
by tying Kit.

00:07:20.633 --> 00:07:23.433
I've gotta get strong enough
to stand on my own two feet.

00:07:23.433 --> 00:07:25.833
I have to get better,
starting today,

00:07:25.833 --> 00:07:28.200
there's no time
like now.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.866
"There's no time
like now ..."

00:07:30.866 --> 00:07:33.100
I gotta go!

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.833
Hey, where are you
off to all of a sudden?

00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:37.666
It's nothing, just...

00:07:37.666 --> 00:07:39.433
things to do
and errands to pay

00:07:39.433 --> 00:07:40.600
and bills to run.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.133
Bills to wha...

00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:43.366
What about class?

00:07:43.366 --> 00:07:46.833
Tell my dad
I can't make it today!

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:49.833
Anyone know what
that was about?

00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:52.633
You gave Gong
all the credit
for your training.

00:07:52.633 --> 00:07:54.566
And said that
you and he were the only ones

00:07:54.566 --> 00:07:56.300
who put up a fight
yesterday.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.033
Those were not
very smart things to say.

00:07:59.033 --> 00:08:01.633
But that's not what I meant,
Zuzu's been great!

00:08:01.633 --> 00:08:03.466
And she put up
a fight yesterday, and...

00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:05.733
She just lost is all,
and, and...

00:08:05.733 --> 00:08:07.333
You blew it.

00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:09.766
Aah!

00:08:09.766 --> 00:08:11.566
(thinking)
<i>Yuya's not the only one</i>

00:08:11.566 --> 00:08:13.133
who can push
himselfto the limits

00:08:13.133 --> 00:08:15.233
and get better, and
he's right!

00:08:15.233 --> 00:08:17.566
There's no
timelike now.

00:08:21.159 --> 00:08:22.459
(Allie)
Maybe there's
a match‐up forum

00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:24.092
or something
you can go to.

00:08:24.092 --> 00:08:25.992
(Tate)
The problem isn't
finding duelists,

00:08:25.992 --> 00:08:28.659
it's finding duelists
willing to duel Yuya!

00:08:30.392 --> 00:08:32.626
(Nico Smiley)
Yuya, my boy!

00:08:32.626 --> 00:08:35.259
So lovely
to see you again!

00:08:35.259 --> 00:08:36.359
Yeah, you too.

00:08:36.359 --> 00:08:38.126
Nico Smiley?

00:08:38.126 --> 00:08:39.726
What are you
doing here?

00:08:39.726 --> 00:08:41.859
He came to bring
amazing news, Yuya!

00:08:41.859 --> 00:08:43.559
This is a big one!

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.292
You've been officially
invited to enter

00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:47.926
this year's Junior
Arc League Championship!

00:08:47.926 --> 00:08:49.892
What?
Seriously?

00:08:49.892 --> 00:08:51.526
Double seriously!

00:08:51.526 --> 00:08:54.192
The Paradise City Duel
Association took notice of

00:08:54.192 --> 00:08:56.459
your valiant victory
against the Sledgehammer,

00:08:56.459 --> 00:08:58.292
and, after some meetings
and deliberations,

00:08:58.292 --> 00:09:00.059
negotiated
by yours truly,

00:09:00.059 --> 00:09:02.959
they have decided to offer you
a spot in the Championship!

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.326
Great!

00:09:04.326 --> 00:09:05.992
This is incredible,
Yuya!

00:09:05.992 --> 00:09:07.192
Now you don't need
to worry about

00:09:07.192 --> 00:09:08.626
finding
four more duels!

00:09:08.626 --> 00:09:10.359
I dance with joy!

00:09:10.359 --> 00:09:11.792
(sighing)

00:09:11.792 --> 00:09:13.026
What's wrong?

00:09:13.026 --> 00:09:16.492
Well, it's a very nice offer
and all, but...

00:09:16.492 --> 00:09:20.592
(third student)
Don't pros like you get
a free pass or something?

00:09:20.592 --> 00:09:23.392
Tell them thanks,
but I'm gonna say no.

00:09:23.392 --> 00:09:24.592
(all gasping)

00:09:24.592 --> 00:09:26.659
But, my boy, why?

00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:29.459
'Cause it kinda seems like
cheating or something.

00:09:29.459 --> 00:09:31.626
No, it's favoritism!

00:09:31.626 --> 00:09:32.826
Okay, that might've
come out wrong,

00:09:32.826 --> 00:09:34.159
but the point is,

00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:35.292
you are in!

00:09:35.292 --> 00:09:38.826
It also feels wrong
toward The Sledgehammer.

00:09:38.826 --> 00:09:40.259
Speaking of which,

00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:41.659
I haven't seen him
in a while.

00:09:41.659 --> 00:09:43.192
How is the champ?

00:09:43.192 --> 00:09:46.159
I am afraid he is
no longer the champion.

00:09:46.159 --> 00:09:47.726
Huh?

00:09:47.726 --> 00:09:50.892
He didn't even say goodbye,
he just left me a sad note.

00:09:50.892 --> 00:09:52.626
Relinquishing
his title

00:09:52.626 --> 00:09:54.726
and saying he was
going to travel overseas

00:09:54.726 --> 00:09:56.892
to find himself.

00:09:58.192 --> 00:10:00.392
I am without
a duelist.

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:02.859
And what is a duel manager
with no duelist

00:10:02.859 --> 00:10:04.492
but an empty shell?

00:10:04.492 --> 00:10:06.326
But if you sign
with me,

00:10:06.326 --> 00:10:08.326
we can start
from the bottom together

00:10:08.326 --> 00:10:10.559
and work our way
to the top!

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:13.126
Bowing out.
Aahhh...

00:10:13.126 --> 00:10:14.659
I get it now.

00:10:14.659 --> 00:10:17.259
That's why you negotiated
with the Association.

00:10:17.259 --> 00:10:19.626
So that you can make
a name for yourself.

00:10:19.626 --> 00:10:20.926
You're the worst.

00:10:20.926 --> 00:10:22.726
That's not true!

00:10:22.726 --> 00:10:24.592
I adore your
talent, Yuya!

00:10:24.592 --> 00:10:26.292
I thoroughly
believe in you!

00:10:28.226 --> 00:10:29.992
If that's really true..

00:10:29.992 --> 00:10:31.726
I need you
to do something.

00:10:31.726 --> 00:10:34.259
Anything.

00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:40.026
(thinking)
How curious that
Declan turned out to be

00:10:40.026 --> 00:10:42.692
the President
of Leo Corp.

00:10:42.692 --> 00:10:47.026
I think this calls for
a further investigation.

00:10:47.026 --> 00:10:51.126
But it looks like security
is really tight.

00:10:51.126 --> 00:10:53.392
I probably can't
just walk in

00:10:53.392 --> 00:10:56.059
and demand to see
the President of the company.

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:02.292
No one lets me have
any fun.

00:11:02.292 --> 00:11:03.359
Oh, well.

00:11:03.359 --> 00:11:05.192
(Zuzu)
I knew it!
Huh?

00:11:05.192 --> 00:11:07.559
You stopped showing up
to the You Show school

00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:10.392
'cause you're trying to
cozy up to Declan Akaba.

00:11:10.392 --> 00:11:11.492
No way!

00:11:11.492 --> 00:11:13.192
You've got
the wrong idea here!

00:11:13.192 --> 00:11:15.592
You're a slimy little
weasel, aren't you?

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:17.826
You just try to latch on
to whoever you think'll

00:11:17.826 --> 00:11:19.459
make you duel better.

00:11:19.459 --> 00:11:21.826
(chuckling)
But Declan seems so cool!

00:11:21.826 --> 00:11:23.826
He's using Fusion
and then Synchro

00:11:23.826 --> 00:11:25.492
and Xyz and Pendulum.

00:11:25.492 --> 00:11:27.626
Think of how much
he could teach me!

00:11:27.626 --> 00:11:28.892
Okay, but...

00:11:28.892 --> 00:11:31.692
I thought you wanted
to learn at our school.

00:11:31.692 --> 00:11:34.426
I was thinking
you guys didn't like me.

00:11:34.426 --> 00:11:35.959
No way,
we love you!

00:11:35.959 --> 00:11:39.326
Anyway, come on!

00:11:39.326 --> 00:11:41.426
I need your help with
something important.

00:11:50.405 --> 00:11:51.938
(Julia)
People are saying
this is where

00:11:51.938 --> 00:11:53.571
Professor Marco
was ambushed.

00:11:53.571 --> 00:11:56.038
Well, the "keep out" ribbon
is kind of a giveaway.

00:11:56.038 --> 00:11:57.705
Someone is obviously

00:11:57.705 --> 00:11:59.671
hiding something in
this warehouse.

00:11:59.671 --> 00:12:02.071
(man)
Can we get forensics
to take a look at this?

00:12:02.071 --> 00:12:04.438
(second man)
I need that analysis,
people.

00:12:04.438 --> 00:12:06.405
Not a good idea.

00:12:06.405 --> 00:12:08.705
Hey, what are
you kids doing here?

00:12:08.705 --> 00:12:10.371
Whoa.
Nothing, just...

00:12:10.371 --> 00:12:12.471
We're here to find out
what happened.

00:12:12.471 --> 00:12:14.938
We're all students
at the Leo Institute.

00:12:14.938 --> 00:12:16.071
My name's Julia,

00:12:16.071 --> 00:12:17.205
and I'm in
Professor Marco's

00:12:17.205 --> 00:12:18.671
Advance Fusion course.

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:21.205
And who're
your friends?
Students?

00:12:21.205 --> 00:12:22.971
I'm, uhh...
I'm Kit,

00:12:22.971 --> 00:12:25.338
and I'm honing my skills
as a Synchro Summoner.

00:12:25.338 --> 00:12:27.838
My name's Dipper,
and I study Xyz Summoning.

00:12:27.838 --> 00:12:31.138
At ease.

00:12:31.138 --> 00:12:33.238
So all three of you are
with the institute?

00:12:33.238 --> 00:12:34.871
(all)
That's right.

00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:36.938
And people know about
what happened?

00:12:36.938 --> 00:12:38.238
Talking about it
at school?

00:12:38.238 --> 00:12:40.071
Sorta. We were
just told that

00:12:40.071 --> 00:12:42.238
someone attacked
Professor Marco.

00:12:42.238 --> 00:12:44.638
And our classes were
going to be cancelled.

00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:46.705
And the TA wouldn't
tell us why.

00:12:46.705 --> 00:12:49.838
We just wanna know
what's going on,
that's all.

00:12:49.838 --> 00:12:51.438
I heard this
might've happened

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:53.705
'cause he's
an international spy
or something.

00:12:53.705 --> 00:12:57.005
Some people are saying
he was attacked by an alien.

00:12:57.005 --> 00:12:58.705
You've gotta tell us
what happened.

00:12:58.705 --> 00:13:00.071
Sorry, guys.

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:02.771
I can't talk to you
about the specifics of the case.

00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:04.471
Your concern is noted.

00:13:04.471 --> 00:13:06.238
Well then,
can you at least tell us

00:13:06.238 --> 00:13:07.938
if the Professor's
okay?

00:13:07.938 --> 00:13:10.371
Can't answer that
either, sorry.

00:13:10.371 --> 00:13:11.838
(gasps)

00:13:11.838 --> 00:13:14.371
But don't worry.

00:13:14.371 --> 00:13:16.505
We'll all
know more soon.

00:13:16.505 --> 00:13:18.271
We've got guys working
in shifts to get

00:13:18.271 --> 00:13:20.271
to the bottom of this.

00:13:20.271 --> 00:13:21.771
For now,
just go home

00:13:21.771 --> 00:13:24.605
and study and practice
and all that.

00:13:24.605 --> 00:13:25.905
After all,
that's what

00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:28.638
Professor Marco would
want you to do, right?

00:13:28.638 --> 00:13:31.271
And also, this place is
totally off limits,

00:13:31.271 --> 00:13:32.905
and you need to forget
you ever came here

00:13:32.905 --> 00:13:34.371
or that we spoke.

00:13:34.371 --> 00:13:36.971
It's for your own
safety, got it?

00:13:36.971 --> 00:13:38.438
Yes.

00:13:42.138 --> 00:13:44.605
How do I get an awesome
uniform like that?

00:13:44.605 --> 00:13:45.771
You've gotta be in

00:13:45.771 --> 00:13:47.171
the top percent of
the Pro League

00:13:47.171 --> 00:13:49.538
and then take
some elite test.

00:13:49.538 --> 00:13:51.938
Those guys are the best
of the best, Kit!

00:13:55.071 --> 00:13:56.371
Huh?

00:13:57.505 --> 00:13:58.638
What are you doing now?

00:13:58.638 --> 00:13:59.738
Where are you going?

00:13:59.738 --> 00:14:01.438
There's another lead
I wanna follow.

00:14:01.438 --> 00:14:03.471
I'll see you guys later!

00:14:03.471 --> 00:14:05.238
"Another lead?"

00:14:05.238 --> 00:14:06.905
She never gives up.

00:14:10.471 --> 00:14:13.138
So, why did you want
to bring me here?

00:14:20.505 --> 00:14:22.538
(groans)

00:14:22.538 --> 00:14:25.305
Sora, I need you to teach me
how to Fusion Summon!

00:14:25.305 --> 00:14:26.771
Here?
Right now?

00:14:26.771 --> 00:14:28.838
Yeah.
I don't know.

00:14:28.838 --> 00:14:30.338
I really need help.

00:14:30.338 --> 00:14:32.338
I need to be
a better duelist.

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:34.705
I get it. You're still
burning from losing

00:14:34.705 --> 00:14:36.705
to that
Leo Institute girl.

00:14:36.705 --> 00:14:38.605
Right?

00:14:38.605 --> 00:14:40.605
(thinking)
I've got it!

00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:46.205
Fooled by an image
reflected in the column.

00:14:46.205 --> 00:14:47.371
Aah!

00:14:50.805 --> 00:14:52.438
They cut the duel short
yesterday,

00:14:52.438 --> 00:14:54.171
but I'm worried
they'll come back.

00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:55.605
And if they do,
I really

00:14:55.605 --> 00:14:57.671
wanna be able
to stand up with Yuya

00:14:57.671 --> 00:14:59.871
and help him defend
the school.

00:14:59.871 --> 00:15:01.505
That's where
you come in.

00:15:01.505 --> 00:15:04.671
You called me a slimy
little weasel, remember?

00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:06.505
Right.
It came out wrong.

00:15:06.505 --> 00:15:08.271
I'm sorry.
Hmm...

00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:09.638
I just don't know.

00:15:09.638 --> 00:15:11.605
Please, Sora?

00:15:11.605 --> 00:15:14.071
It's not that
I can't teach you.

00:15:14.071 --> 00:15:15.638
I'm not sure
I should.

00:15:15.638 --> 00:15:17.405
Because if
I teach you stuff,

00:15:17.405 --> 00:15:18.738
your dueling
will improve.

00:15:18.738 --> 00:15:19.971
Well, yeah,
of course!

00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:21.771
That's kinda
the whole point.

00:15:21.771 --> 00:15:23.505
You teach me,
and I get better.

00:15:23.505 --> 00:15:25.471
C'mon, Sora!

00:15:25.471 --> 00:15:27.305
Fine.

00:15:30.438 --> 00:15:31.705
Okay, here.

00:15:31.705 --> 00:15:33.805
This is
Polymerization.

00:15:33.805 --> 00:15:36.071
This card is the end‐all,
be‐all of Fusion.

00:15:36.071 --> 00:15:38.138
It's pretty much
the foundation.

00:15:38.138 --> 00:15:39.438
It's what you use

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:40.905
to combine
monsters together.

00:15:40.905 --> 00:15:42.105
Got it?

00:15:42.105 --> 00:15:43.671
I'm with you.

00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:45.138
(thinking)
I can't believe

00:15:45.138 --> 00:15:46.705
I'm actually
teaching her.

00:15:46.705 --> 00:15:49.471
My tragic flaw is that
I'm too nice.

00:15:49.471 --> 00:15:53.105
And so the required monsters
can either be on the field

00:15:53.105 --> 00:15:54.438
or in my hand, right?

00:15:54.438 --> 00:15:56.938
Hand or field.
That's right.

00:15:56.938 --> 00:15:59.938
The important thing is that
they're all in one or the
other.

00:15:59.938 --> 00:16:02.138
There are exceptions,
of course.

00:16:02.138 --> 00:16:04.138
So when I activate this,

00:16:04.138 --> 00:16:05.971
the monsters
I'm fusing together

00:16:05.971 --> 00:16:07.271
go to the graveyard.

00:16:07.271 --> 00:16:08.638
Then I summon
the Fusion Monster

00:16:08.638 --> 00:16:10.005
from my Extra Deck.

00:16:10.005 --> 00:16:11.638
Yeah, that's...

00:16:14.105 --> 00:16:15.571
Hey, where are
you going?

00:16:20.205 --> 00:16:22.005
Who‐‐ hey!

00:16:40.171 --> 00:16:42.271
Talk.
Who are you?

00:16:44.438 --> 00:16:46.671
You're not from
around here, right?

00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:48.505
Neither are you.

00:16:48.505 --> 00:16:50.905
Hey! Hang on.
I know you.

00:16:50.905 --> 00:16:53.171
You do?
So who is he then?

00:16:53.171 --> 00:16:56.038
He dueled Sylvio
and beat him.

00:16:57.505 --> 00:17:00.238
I Xyz Summon...

00:17:00.238 --> 00:17:03.238
Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon!

00:17:07.838 --> 00:17:10.838
So is this latest incident
your doing, too?

00:17:10.838 --> 00:17:12.738
(Sora)
"Latest incident?"

00:17:12.738 --> 00:17:14.138
What?

00:17:14.138 --> 00:17:17.138
Some Leo Institute teacher
was just attacked.

00:17:17.138 --> 00:17:19.405
Really, now...

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:21.471
That would explain why
the security

00:17:21.471 --> 00:17:23.905
at Leo Corp
was so tight.

00:17:23.905 --> 00:17:25.305
Well, you've got

00:17:25.305 --> 00:17:27.005
a lot of explaining
to do.

00:17:30.638 --> 00:17:32.438
How 'bout we start with
who you are?

00:17:33.605 --> 00:17:35.571
Why'd you duel Sylvio?

00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:37.071
What are you up to?

00:17:37.071 --> 00:17:40.205
What's your problem
with Leo Corp?

00:17:40.205 --> 00:17:41.505
(door slides open)

00:17:41.505 --> 00:17:44.305
(Julia)
Answer the questions!

00:17:44.305 --> 00:17:45.571
Julia!

00:17:45.571 --> 00:17:46.971
Who are you,
and what did you do

00:17:46.971 --> 00:17:48.805
to Professor Marco?

00:17:48.805 --> 00:17:50.805
This is turning into
a real party.

00:17:50.805 --> 00:17:53.105
I'm gonna ask you
one last time.

00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:54.705
Where is he?

00:17:54.705 --> 00:17:56.671
All right,
if you don't wanna talk,

00:17:56.671 --> 00:17:58.571
then maybe you
wanna duel.

00:17:58.571 --> 00:18:00.305
Hang on a second!

00:18:00.305 --> 00:18:02.171
You can't just barge in here
and start demanding‐‐

00:18:02.171 --> 00:18:04.271
Get outta the way,
wannabe.

00:18:04.271 --> 00:18:05.805
Did you call me a...

00:18:05.805 --> 00:18:07.505
Look, you only think
he's involved with

00:18:07.505 --> 00:18:08.705
your missing
professor,

00:18:08.705 --> 00:18:10.071
but you‐‐
I'll know
he's involved

00:18:10.071 --> 00:18:12.538
when we duel
and he starts
Xyz Summoning!

00:18:12.538 --> 00:18:15.905
Xyz summoning?
Oh, interesting!

00:18:18.005 --> 00:18:19.538
You'll be talking
soon enough

00:18:19.538 --> 00:18:20.705
when I'm through
with you.

00:18:20.705 --> 00:18:22.571
Come on,
let's do this!

00:18:22.571 --> 00:18:24.538
You're not going
to get answers this way.

00:18:24.538 --> 00:18:25.705
You gotta calm down.

00:18:25.705 --> 00:18:27.238
(chimes)

00:18:28.671 --> 00:18:30.205
(groans)

00:18:37.338 --> 00:18:39.105
Great.
He's gone.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.623
He...
he disappeared.

00:18:45.623 --> 00:18:47.890
Just like last time.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:48.923
(Yuya)
Zuzu!
Huh?

00:18:48.923 --> 00:18:50.657
You in there?

00:18:50.657 --> 00:18:52.657
Yuya!
Ahh!

00:18:52.657 --> 00:18:55.123
Good! Everyone was
totally worried,

00:18:55.123 --> 00:18:56.790
and you weren't
answering your phone,

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.923
and‐‐ and I'm
really sorry

00:18:58.923 --> 00:19:01.323
if I made you feel
unappreciated earlier!

00:19:01.323 --> 00:19:02.723
I get it now!

00:19:02.723 --> 00:19:04.690
You teamed up with him
and helped him escape!

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:06.290
Whoa!
Julia?

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:07.757
And... Sora?

00:19:07.757 --> 00:19:10.857
Talk. What have you done
with Professor Marco?

00:19:10.857 --> 00:19:12.023
Nothing.

00:19:12.023 --> 00:19:13.323
Don't play dumb!

00:19:13.323 --> 00:19:15.357
I know you're
working with him.

00:19:15.357 --> 00:19:16.623
Working with who?

00:19:18.823 --> 00:19:21.290
The guy who dueled Sylvio
showed up again.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.457
He did?
So then where is he?

00:19:23.457 --> 00:19:25.957
He vanished
right before you showed up,

00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:27.157
just like before.

00:19:27.157 --> 00:19:29.423
Huh?
That's weird.

00:19:29.423 --> 00:19:31.257
You know something,
don't you?

00:19:31.257 --> 00:19:33.090
Hey, there he goes!

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.323
Over there!

00:19:34.323 --> 00:19:35.723
He's up on
the rooftop!

00:19:35.723 --> 00:19:37.090
You better hurry up
and chase him

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:38.623
before he gets away!

00:19:38.623 --> 00:19:40.257
Outta my way, Yuya!

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:43.423
So who'd you see?

00:19:43.423 --> 00:19:44.690
No one.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.290
I just wanted
to get rid of Julia

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.057
so we could get back
to training.

00:19:48.057 --> 00:19:50.857
Training?
You and Zuzu?

00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:53.523
Yeah. Zuzu asked me
to help her with...

00:19:54.857 --> 00:19:57.223
Wait, is it supposed
to be a secret

00:19:57.223 --> 00:20:00.090
that you wanted me to
teach you Fusion Summoning?

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.123
Fusion Summoning?

00:20:02.123 --> 00:20:03.390
Uhh...

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.690
Is this for the Junior
Arc League Championship?

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.423
That reminds me!
I totally found

00:20:08.423 --> 00:20:10.157
my next four opponents!

00:20:10.157 --> 00:20:11.523
Actually,
that's not true,

00:20:11.523 --> 00:20:13.557
but I found the guy
who's gonna find them.

00:20:13.557 --> 00:20:16.390
Nico Smiley says
he can hook me up!

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:18.623
Yeah?
Good for you.

00:20:18.623 --> 00:20:21.257
Thanks! Now I just
gotta win 'em all!

00:20:21.257 --> 00:20:24.790
And if I manage to do that,
it's Championship time!

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.823
Hey, Yuya, what's
this Championship

00:20:26.823 --> 00:20:28.123
you keep mentioning?

00:20:28.123 --> 00:20:29.357
Can I enter it,
too?

00:20:29.357 --> 00:20:31.723
Uh, I dunno, Sora...

00:20:31.723 --> 00:20:34.023
Have you dueled
at least 50 times

00:20:34.023 --> 00:20:35.390
since coming to town?

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.123
'Cause you need
50 duels

00:20:37.123 --> 00:20:38.623
and 30 wins
to enter.

00:20:38.623 --> 00:20:40.957
That many?
No fair!

00:20:40.957 --> 00:20:43.890
How come nobody ever wants
to let me have any fun?

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.990
Hey, actually,
Nico mentioned

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.657
a stipulation
or something

00:20:47.657 --> 00:20:49.723
where you can also
qualify for the tournament

00:20:49.723 --> 00:20:52.357
by winning six matches
in a row without losing.

00:20:52.357 --> 00:20:54.323
Oh, yeah?
All right!

00:20:54.323 --> 00:20:56.057
Taking down six chumps
in a row,

00:20:56.057 --> 00:20:57.323
that'll be easy!

00:20:57.323 --> 00:20:59.690
Do you think you could have
that Nico Smiley guy

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.290
line up
the opponents for me?

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:02.923
Then I can just
knock 'em down!

00:21:02.923 --> 00:21:04.157
Sure thing.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.490
(thinking)
I guess I'm not
the only one

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:09.390
who wants
to step up my game.

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.590
We've all got
something driving us.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.757
I just realized
there's a way

00:21:13.757 --> 00:21:16.357
to evolve
the Pendulum method!

00:21:16.357 --> 00:21:18.523
(thinking)
I don't know what
he was talking about.

00:21:18.523 --> 00:21:19.890
But if he's right,

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.290
and there's more
beyond what I know

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:24.357
of Pendulum Summoning,
I'm gonna find it.

00:21:26.823 --> 00:21:28.557
(Zuzu)
Who was
that mystery man?

00:21:28.557 --> 00:21:30.123
What does he want?

00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:31.657
And why can't
I shake the feeling

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:34.123
that it has something
to do with me?

00:21:39.923 --> 00:21:41.690
(whirring)

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.490
