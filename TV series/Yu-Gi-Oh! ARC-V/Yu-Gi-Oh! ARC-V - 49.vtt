WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.366
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V."

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.033
Celina.
Huh?

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:07.400
You're coming with us.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.133
Yeah? Just come on over here
and try and make me.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.933
Let's Duel!
Let's Duel!

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.000
Look, there!
Huh? Look where?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.166
It's Zuzu!

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.533
Mind if we join?

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:26.900
2,000 points of pain will now...

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.933
Ruff you up!

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.733
Aah!

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.900
Oh, no!
Poor Reed!

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.000
Now, they're gonna pay!
Aagghh!

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.400
I believe it's your turn.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.733
Say good‐bye!

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.133
Not so fast.

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:48.866
Sylvio's stepping in with the
Action Spell Flame Guard!

00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.466
Huh?
Huh?

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.166
Sora!

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.500
What you're doing is wrong!

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.833
You've forgotten what dueling
is all about.

00:00:56.833 --> 00:01:00.266
But I'll make you remember,
no matter what it takes!

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.466

I Xyz Summon...

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.233
Triple‐C Rock Armor of Battle!

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:17.533
(roaring)

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:22.433
(thinking)
I knew something like this
was coming,

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:24.700
and I'm ready for it.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.400
I activate Rock Armor's
special ability.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.600
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.466
Rock Armor gets half
the defense points

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:34.466
of both our monsters added to
its attack points.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.466
And now, Rock Armor attacks
your Gadget Giant.

00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:42.166
Not so fast, Riley.

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:45.500
My Gadget Giant has
a giant advantage
you don't know about.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.900
Its special ability
automatically destroys
your monster!

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.300
A premeditated parry!

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.900
Tate's got Riley on the ropes!

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.600
My Rock Armor's
special ability prevents it

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.533
from being destroyed by your
Gadget Giant.

00:02:57.533 --> 00:02:59.566
Then it's all...

00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:04.666
Over!

00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:07.900
(Nico)
‐ A rocking, shocking,
come‐from‐behind triumph!

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.266
With Fusion, Synchro and Xyz
Summons,

00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:14.966
Leo Institute's Riley is
the Youth Division champ!

00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:17.466
You deserve it, Riley.

00:03:17.466 --> 00:03:19.800
The way you used
three ways of summoning

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.700
just like Declan Akaba does.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.266
Yeah.
Just like Declan.

00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:27.433
(Obelisk)
You might have us
outnumbered,

00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:30.500
but I guarantee your
number's up!

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.133
(Sylvio)
Oh, please, if it was
you three against just me,

00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:35.866
you still wouldn't
have a chance!

00:03:35.866 --> 00:03:38.466
Your dueling's for the dogs!

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:40.066
My turn.

00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:41.900
I draw!

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.700
With Scale One Abyss
Actor Evil Heel

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.600
and Scale Eight Abyss Actor
Funky Comedian,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.400
I set the Pendulum Scale!

00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:54.733
Now, I can summon monsters
between Level Two and Seven

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:57.200
all at the same time!

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.433
I Pendulum Summon!

00:03:59.433 --> 00:04:01.033
Monsters, emerge!

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:05.366
Allow me to introduce Abyss
Actor Superstar!

00:04:05.366 --> 00:04:10.433
This Superstar lets me add Abyss
Script Fantasy Magic to my hand!

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:12.900
It's time for my Superstar to
take center stage

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.800
so I'll activate my Script!

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.466
Superstar's read it over,
and now he'll nail the role!

00:04:20.466 --> 00:04:21.733
Showtime!

00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:25.866
Superstar, attack Triple Ancient
Gear Hunting Hound!

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.166
You got a lot to learn about
battling, kid.

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:33.900
Destroying that Hound
won't stop us from
crushing you and your crew.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.033
Oh, I didn't destroy it.

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:38.900
Due to Fantasy Magic, your
Hunting Hound returns

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.233
to your Extra Deck instead of
going to your graveyard.

00:04:42.233 --> 00:04:45.866
So your killer combo won't
activate, and you can't hurt
me.

00:04:45.866 --> 00:04:47.233
Think again!

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:51.500
I activate the trap Ancient Gear
Reverse Fusion!

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.433
You thought you got rid
of my Hunting Hound,

00:04:53.433 --> 00:04:55.733
but all you did was let me
Fusion Summon

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:57.833
the true leader of the pack!

00:04:57.833 --> 00:05:00.966
Ultimate Ancient Gear Hunting
Hound!

00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:07.800
And now to show off
the power of its bite,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.200
half of all your life points
instantly disappear!

00:05:14.833 --> 00:05:17.066
You'll hear from my father
for that!

00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:19.333
Make sure to tell him
everything you did
to help our opponents.

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:20.333
I'm up.

00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:21.733
(grunts)

00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:24.700
You're in no shape to battle!

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.700
So Gong's taking over!

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.133
Intrusion penalty,
2,000 life points.

00:05:40.533 --> 00:05:42.033
On with the show.

00:05:42.033 --> 00:05:44.666
I activate the spell
Toy Vendor.

00:05:44.666 --> 00:05:46.600
And it's super fun‐tastic,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.233
'cause it lets me
get rid of a card

00:05:48.233 --> 00:05:50.733
to draw a new one
from my deck!

00:05:50.733 --> 00:05:52.866
Later, Fluffal Wings.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.700
And if I draw a monster card
that's Level Four or below,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.200
I'm allowed to summon it.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.233
But if it's not, I'll have
to toss it into my graveyard.

00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:03.266
Ha!

00:06:03.266 --> 00:06:04.233
Yes!

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.033
Next I activate
Polymerization!

00:06:14.466 --> 00:06:16.566
I Fusion Summon!

00:06:16.566 --> 00:06:18.566
Edge of sharpness
and fury of bear!

00:06:18.566 --> 00:06:21.366
When the two come together,
you had better beware!

00:06:21.366 --> 00:06:24.166
Welcome to the party,
Frightfur Bear!

00:06:24.166 --> 00:06:26.566
I'll end my turn with a
facedown.

00:06:26.566 --> 00:06:28.933
You never should have
challenged me, Yuya,

00:06:28.933 --> 00:06:31.066
'cause losing to me isn't
gonna be pretty!

00:06:31.066 --> 00:06:34.200
Then it's a good thing
I refuse to lose!

00:06:37.533 --> 00:06:39.966
You never should have
challenged me, Yuya,

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:42.166
'cause losing to me isn't
gonna be pretty!

00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:44.900
Then it's a good thing
I refuse to lose!

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.100
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to remind you

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.366
that dueling's all
about having fun!

00:06:49.366 --> 00:06:50.733
Hyah!

00:06:51.833 --> 00:06:54.733
I'm using Scale One Stargazer
Magician

00:06:54.733 --> 00:06:56.600
and Scale Eight
Timegazer Magician

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.666
to set
the Pendulum Scale!

00:06:58.666 --> 00:07:02.566
I'm taking control of
this duel, starting now!

00:07:02.566 --> 00:07:05.733
Now I can summon monsters
between Level Two and Seven

00:07:05.733 --> 00:07:07.766
all at the
same time!

00:07:07.766 --> 00:07:11.766
Swing far, Pendulum!
Carve the arc of victory!

00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:15.666
My monster's ready to swing
into action!

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.166
Turn up the heat, Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:07:22.166 --> 00:07:25.466
Sora, remember the first time we
dueled each other?

00:07:25.466 --> 00:07:28.166
I half‐remember.
I was half‐trying.

00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:30.533
And it was half fun for like
half a second.

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:32.533
Well, I fully
remember someone

00:07:32.533 --> 00:07:34.666
who loved to duel
for the right reasons!

00:07:34.666 --> 00:07:36.900
To have fun
and to entertain!

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.700
And I'm going to do whatever
it takes to get that person
back!

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.366
Odd‐Eyes, attack!

00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:45.233
I activate the Action Spell
Flame Chain!

00:07:45.233 --> 00:07:49.233
This'll burn up 400 of your
Penuldum Dragon's precious
attack points!

00:07:49.233 --> 00:07:52.966
Not if I activate Stargazer
Magician's Pendulum ability!

00:07:52.966 --> 00:07:55.900
Watch in wonder as Stargazer
works his wizardry

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.500
and stops your spell right in
its tracks!

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.166
Halting Horoscope!

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.933
I activate Flame Surge!

00:08:10.933 --> 00:08:12.966
It gives Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon

00:08:12.966 --> 00:08:16.800
an extra 400 attack
points during this turn!

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.533
I'm activating the spell
De‐Fusion!

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:22.166
I separate Frightfur Bear back
into Fluffal Bear

00:08:22.166 --> 00:08:23.733
and Edge Imp Sabres!

00:08:23.733 --> 00:08:26.833
Nice to have double the defense
back to defend me.

00:08:27.933 --> 00:08:31.533
Odd‐Eyes,
attack Edge Imp Sabres!

00:08:31.533 --> 00:08:35.366
Since your Edge Imp Sabres
was in defense mode
when it was destroyed,

00:08:35.366 --> 00:08:38.666
Flame Surge deals your Sabres
defense points as damage!

00:08:41.266 --> 00:08:43.333
I'm ending my turn now.

00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:46.233
So Odd‐Eyes' attack points go
back to normal!

00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:48.500
Admit it, Sora, this back and
forth battle's

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.833
got you soul smiling.

00:08:51.833 --> 00:08:54.066
This is what it
used to be like!

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:56.266
Isn't it great to be
dueling for fun again?

00:08:56.266 --> 00:08:59.933
You don't understand anything
about dueling.

00:08:59.933 --> 00:09:02.200
It's for destroying
your enemy.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.066
Huh?

00:09:05.933 --> 00:09:08.866
Zuzu, this Pendulum Card
you gave back to Gong

00:09:08.866 --> 00:09:11.066
is gonna swing
this duel our way!

00:09:11.066 --> 00:09:13.166
With Scale One
Pendulumstatue Red Fiend

00:09:13.166 --> 00:09:16.033
and Scale 12 Pendulumstatue
Black Sun,

00:09:16.033 --> 00:09:18.700
Gong sets the Pendulum Scale!

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.600
Now Gong can summon monsters
between Level Two and 11

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.733
all at the same time!

00:09:23.733 --> 00:09:25.200
Gong Pendulum Summons!

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.900
And brings out two Superheavy
Samurai Thieves

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.133
and Superheavy Samurai
Transporter!

00:09:32.133 --> 00:09:34.366
Now, Gong activates

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:37.366
Superheavy Samurai Thief's
special ability!

00:09:37.366 --> 00:09:41.100
Gong tributes it to get a spell
card that activated last turn!

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.866
Sylvio's Evil Heel may be a
Pendulum Monster,

00:09:43.866 --> 00:09:45.566
but it's also a spell card,

00:09:45.566 --> 00:09:48.133
so Gong is gonna take it!

00:09:48.133 --> 00:09:50.600
You know we're on
the same team right?

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.766
I mean, you could use that
move against someone else,

00:09:52.766 --> 00:09:53.766
like our opponents!

00:09:53.766 --> 00:09:56.100
True, but that's no fun.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.333
Gong tributes Gong's
second Thief

00:09:58.333 --> 00:10:02.566
to get your other Pendulum
Monster, Sylvio.

00:10:02.566 --> 00:10:05.900
But Gong ain't greedy 'cause
sharing means caring!

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.300
Gong tributes Superheavy
Samurai Thief

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.033
to give these two Pendulum
Monsters to Shay!

00:10:11.033 --> 00:10:13.500
Why did you give me these
Pendulum cards?

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.533
Because we're a team.

00:10:15.533 --> 00:10:17.233
Now go and make Gong proud!

00:10:24.433 --> 00:10:26.433
Dueling has never
been for fun,

00:10:26.433 --> 00:10:29.166
but I guess it was fun seeing
all those Xyzians run for cover.

00:10:29.166 --> 00:10:32.500
I refuse to believe that this is
who you really are!

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.833
Sorry, bud.

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:36.866
Some things just simply are
what they are.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.733
It's my turn!

00:10:40.733 --> 00:10:42.433
Aagghh!

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:44.166
(thinking)
All these people...

00:10:44.166 --> 00:10:45.700
coming together.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.433
risking everything.

00:10:47.433 --> 00:10:48.633
But why?

00:10:48.633 --> 00:10:51.033
Because we're a team.

00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:52.366
And this team's...

00:10:52.366 --> 00:10:53.866
gonna win!

00:10:53.866 --> 00:10:57.466
With Scale One Evil Heel and
Scale Eight Funky Comedian,

00:10:57.466 --> 00:10:59.300
I set the Pendulum Scale!

00:11:02.633 --> 00:11:05.533
Now I can summon monsters
between Level Two and Seven

00:11:05.533 --> 00:11:08.566
all at the same time!

00:11:08.566 --> 00:11:10.266
I Pendulum Summon!

00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:12.933
A trio of terror!

00:11:14.533 --> 00:11:18.266
Raidraptor Wild Vultures!

00:11:18.266 --> 00:11:21.733
With these three monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.600
Fiercest falcon,
set your wings ablaze

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.266
and lock your gaze on our
ill‐fated foes!

00:11:35.266 --> 00:11:37.166
I Xyz Summon!

00:11:37.166 --> 00:11:38.733
Appear!

00:11:38.733 --> 00:11:42.900
Raidraptor Revolution Falcon!

00:11:45.566 --> 00:11:49.666
I activate Revolution Falcon's
special ability!

00:11:49.666 --> 00:11:51.566
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:11:51.566 --> 00:11:54.466
it can attack each one of your
monsters!

00:11:54.466 --> 00:11:56.200
That won't make a difference.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.333
We'll just come at you with
our damage‐dealing combo.

00:11:58.333 --> 00:12:00.133
You won't get that chance,

00:12:00.133 --> 00:12:02.366
cause when Revolution Falcon
battles your Hounds,

00:12:02.366 --> 00:12:06.300
all of your monster's
attack and defense points
completely disappear!

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.066
Revolution Falcon, go!

00:12:11.433 --> 00:12:13.600
Avenge those who have fallen

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.400
and destroy the enemy!

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.900
Blitzing Bombardment!

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.766
(all)
Aah!

00:12:25.766 --> 00:12:27.800
All right, in your face!

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.100
How's that feel, losers?
(laughing)

00:12:33.233 --> 00:12:35.233
Face the facts, Yuya.

00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:37.100
Dueling is a means to an end.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.100
Your end.

00:12:40.866 --> 00:12:43.700
My turn.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.200
I send Filuffal Wings
to the graveyard

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.833
so that I can insert another
coin into Toy Vendor!

00:12:49.833 --> 00:12:52.233
I wonder what goody will drop
out this time!

00:12:52.233 --> 00:12:53.666
Hyah!

00:12:53.666 --> 00:12:55.100
Perfect!

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.800
It's Level Two Fluffal Owl,
which means I can summon it!

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.133
Fluffal Owl lets me get
Polymerization from my deck

00:13:02.133 --> 00:13:05.333
and then add it straight
to my hand!

00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:07.366
Since Toy Vendor's on my field,

00:13:07.366 --> 00:13:10.333
I can activate Filuffal Wings's
special ability

00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:11.766
from the graveyard!

00:13:11.766 --> 00:13:13.300
By banishing two
Filuffal Wings,

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.766
I can draw two cards
from my deck!

00:13:15.766 --> 00:13:19.633
Then, by tributing Toy Vendor,
I draw one more card.

00:13:22.366 --> 00:13:24.566
He just drew three cards?

00:13:24.566 --> 00:13:27.166
Now I activate the spell
Edge Nightmare!

00:13:27.166 --> 00:13:29.100
And, boy, is it terrifying

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.833
because it lets me
summon a monster

00:13:30.833 --> 00:13:34.533
from my graveyard that's
truly a cut above the rest!

00:13:34.533 --> 00:13:36.133
Edge Imp Sabres!

00:13:36.133 --> 00:13:38.700
Next I'm activating
Polymerization

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:44.100
to fuse Edge Imp Sabres,
Fluffal Bear and Fluffal Owl!

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:48.700
Bird of prey, edge of sharpness,
fury of bear,

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:53.000
when the three come together,
prepare for a scare!

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I Fusion Summon!

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.033
Frightfur Tiger!

00:13:57.033 --> 00:13:59.600
Get set to cut Yuya down to
size!

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.066
I remember when you used to
build people up.

00:14:02.066 --> 00:14:04.666
Like when you taught Zuzu
how to Fusion Summon.

00:14:04.666 --> 00:14:07.166
You did it out of
friendship and for fun!

00:14:07.166 --> 00:14:09.200
Fun's for the foolish.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.200
Fusion Summoning's a tool to
crush your enemies.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.066
And guess who is
enemy number one?

00:14:15.066 --> 00:14:17.966
You don't get it! Dueling to
hurt others is just wrong!

00:14:17.966 --> 00:14:19.966
I say it's right!

00:14:19.966 --> 00:14:21.933
When Frightfur Tiger's
Fusion Summoned,

00:14:21.933 --> 00:14:24.066
it destroys the same number
of monsters

00:14:24.066 --> 00:14:25.866
that were fused to create it!

00:14:25.866 --> 00:14:28.900
I fused three,
so I destroy three!

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.200
And last but not least,
Frightfur Tiger

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.566
gets 300 attack points for every
Frightfur monster on my field!

00:14:36.566 --> 00:14:38.800
(roaring)

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.200
It's time.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.866
Frightfur Tiger,
tear him apart!

00:14:46.566 --> 00:14:49.000
(roaring)

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
It's time.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.500
Frightfur Tiger,
tear him apart!

00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:56.700
(sinister laugh)

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.566
Aah!

00:15:04.233 --> 00:15:06.633
I truly am enjoying myself,

00:15:06.633 --> 00:15:09.566
but like all good things,
this turn must come to end.

00:15:09.566 --> 00:15:12.533
You're not having much fun,
though, are you?

00:15:12.533 --> 00:15:16.166
You weren't always mean
like this, Sora.

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:18.633
What happened to
the Sora I knew?

00:15:18.633 --> 00:15:20.966
You just never saw
this side of me.

00:15:20.966 --> 00:15:24.166
I'm the fiercest Fusion
Warrior Duel Academy's ever
had.

00:15:24.166 --> 00:15:26.333
None of that matters to me.

00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:28.733
All that matters to me
is you're...

00:15:28.733 --> 00:15:30.866
my friend!

00:15:30.866 --> 00:15:34.766
I summon Performapal Skeeter
Skimmer!

00:15:34.766 --> 00:15:38.266
Since Skeeter Skimmer's taken
the stage, I can also summon

00:15:38.266 --> 00:15:40.966
Performapal Secondonkey to share
the spotlight!

00:15:40.966 --> 00:15:42.366
It's showtime!

00:15:42.366 --> 00:15:46.833
With these two monsters, I build
the Overlay Network!

00:15:48.266 --> 00:15:50.700
I Xyz Summon...

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.500
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.866
You know what Duel Academy did
to the Xyz Dimension?

00:16:00.866 --> 00:16:02.633
It wrecked their world.

00:16:02.633 --> 00:16:04.933
A world filled with happiness
and joy!

00:16:04.933 --> 00:16:07.400
Your buddies took it all away!

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.866
Stuff happens.

00:16:08.866 --> 00:16:11.333
You can't make an omelet
without breaking a few eggs.

00:16:11.333 --> 00:16:13.633
You had no right
to do what you did.

00:16:13.633 --> 00:16:16.166
And I'm going to do everything
I can to make you see that!

00:16:16.166 --> 00:16:20.100
I activate Dark Rebellion Xyz
Dragon's special ability!

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.766
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:16:21.766 --> 00:16:24.233
the attack points of your Tiger
are cut in half!

00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:27.733
And then Dark Rebellion Xyz
Dragon gains those attack
points.

00:16:27.733 --> 00:16:31.133
I won't give up
'til you come to your senses!

00:16:31.133 --> 00:16:33.900
Then give up!
This is the real me!

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.533
I activate the trap
Frightfur March!

00:16:36.533 --> 00:16:40.233
It blocks your Dragon's special
ability, but that's not all!

00:16:40.233 --> 00:16:42.766
It also lets me send a monster
from my deck

00:16:42.766 --> 00:16:47.733
to the graveyard to Summon
another Fusion Monster!

00:16:47.733 --> 00:16:51.800
Here's the wild, wicked cat
that's all paws, claws and
jaws.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.633
Frightfur Sabre‐Tooth!

00:16:55.633 --> 00:16:57.800
Frightfur Sabre‐Tooth's
special ability

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.400
lets me summon a monster
from my graveyard!

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.666
And I'm choosing the bear with
so much more than scare...

00:17:04.666 --> 00:17:07.400
Frightfur Bear!

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.133
(growling)

00:17:09.133 --> 00:17:12.533
And thanks to Frightfur Tiger,
my three furry friends

00:17:12.533 --> 00:17:16.666
get 300 extra attack points for
every Frightfur on my field.

00:17:16.666 --> 00:17:19.133
And Saber Tiger's
does the same thing,

00:17:19.133 --> 00:17:21.333
except they all get
400 attack points

00:17:21.333 --> 00:17:23.466
for every Frightfur
on my field!

00:17:26.166 --> 00:17:28.200
I'll save you for later.

00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:33.866
I set the Pendulum Scale with
Scale Three Xiangke Magician

00:17:33.866 --> 00:17:36.033
and Scale Eight Xiangsheng
Magician.

00:17:36.033 --> 00:17:38.900
This duel's about
to swing my way!

00:17:43.233 --> 00:17:46.333
Now I can summon monsters
between Level Four and Seven

00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:47.933
all at the same time!

00:17:47.933 --> 00:17:49.866
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:17:49.866 --> 00:17:52.666
Carve the arc of victory!

00:17:52.666 --> 00:17:57.133
My monster's ready to swing
into action!

00:17:58.466 --> 00:18:01.900
Come on back, Odd‐Eyes Pendulum
Dragon!

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.166
(roaring)

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:06.366
So you brought Odd‐Eyes back.

00:18:06.366 --> 00:18:08.733
You always were one for
surprises.

00:18:08.733 --> 00:18:10.400
I guess you got me again.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.233
And I don't plan on
stopping, Sora!

00:18:13.233 --> 00:18:17.033
I activate Xiangke's
Pendulum ability.

00:18:17.033 --> 00:18:20.366
It changes Dark Rebellion Xyz
Dragon's Rank into a Level!

00:18:24.366 --> 00:18:27.900
Level Evolution!

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.833
(roaring)

00:18:32.133 --> 00:18:34.333
It has a Level
instead of a Rank?

00:18:34.333 --> 00:18:37.600
Now Xiangsheng Magician's
Pendulum ability activates!

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.700
I'm taking aim and my game to
the next level!

00:18:44.733 --> 00:18:47.900
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon will
now have the same Level

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.800
as Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.333
The stage has been set!

00:18:51.333 --> 00:18:53.000
I can't believe it.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.333
Now he's got two monsters
with the same Level!

00:18:55.333 --> 00:18:58.833
(thinking) Yuto, I'm having a
hard time trying to get Sora

00:18:58.833 --> 00:19:01.166
to understand what dueling's
really about.

00:19:01.166 --> 00:19:05.666
But maybe together, by combining
our monsters, we can reach him!

00:19:05.666 --> 00:19:07.900
Now, it's showtime!

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.033
I overlay Dark Rebellion Xyz
Dragon

00:19:11.033 --> 00:19:12.766
and Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon

00:19:12.766 --> 00:19:15.000
in order to build the Overlay
Network!

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.433
Dragon with blazing,
raging eyes,

00:19:17.433 --> 00:19:22.166
come and conquer all that
stand against you!

00:19:22.166 --> 00:19:24.900
I Xyz Summon!

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.700
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon!

00:19:30.366 --> 00:19:32.566
(roaring)

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.600
I Xyz Summon!

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.766
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon!

00:19:40.766 --> 00:19:45.266
And now I activate Odd‐Eyes
Rebellion Dragon's special
ability.

00:19:45.266 --> 00:19:49.066
Since Level Seven
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon
was used to summon it,

00:19:49.066 --> 00:19:52.900
all Level Seven‐or‐below
monsters on your field
are destroyed,

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.533
and you take damage equal to
their attack points!

00:19:55.533 --> 00:19:58.600
The trap Fusion Fortress
will save me!

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.066
Since I've got
a Fusion Monster on my field,

00:20:01.066 --> 00:20:03.933
I can't take damage from any
special ability!

00:20:03.933 --> 00:20:06.166
I may have saved
my life points,

00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:08.700
but Frightfur Saber Tiger's
attack points drop

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.366
because it lost
its Frightfur buddies.

00:20:13.966 --> 00:20:17.400
Look there!
Yuya and Sora are battling!

00:20:20.966 --> 00:20:22.600
(sinister laugh)

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.300
This is turning out to be
a real blast!

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.833
You really know how to
put on a show, Yuya!

00:20:27.833 --> 00:20:31.566
It's why I always have so much
fun dueling you!

00:20:31.566 --> 00:20:32.933
There!
Huh?

00:20:32.933 --> 00:20:35.300
You just said it yourself,
Sora!

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.600
It's fun!

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.600
It's time you stopped
fighting that fact.

00:20:40.333 --> 00:20:44.300
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon,
get the fireworks started!

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:48.433
By using one Overlay Unit,
it can attack you twice!

00:20:51.733 --> 00:20:55.900
Odd‐Eyes, time to swoop in and
take out Saber‐Tooth!

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.166
I'm activating Flame Chain!

00:20:58.166 --> 00:21:02.200
It shrinks your Dragon's
attack points by 400!

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.166
I'll counter that with
Flame Surge!

00:21:05.166 --> 00:21:09.166
Odd‐Eyes gets those 400 attack
points right back!

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.000
Aah!
Aah!

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.866
(Nico)
<i>Time's up!</i>

00:21:21.866 --> 00:21:27.000
The Battle Royal is
officially over!

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.100
Yuya!
You all right?

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.300
Yeah, Gong, I'm fine.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.333
Hey, you found Zuzu!
All right!

00:21:34.333 --> 00:21:37.366
I was so worried about you!

00:21:37.366 --> 00:21:40.833
Zuzu! Stop making
goo‐goo eyes at my Yuya!

00:21:40.833 --> 00:21:43.600
I saw you getting lovey‐dovey
with someone else!

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.566
I'm not Zuzu.

00:21:45.566 --> 00:21:46.733
Huh?
Huh?

00:21:46.733 --> 00:21:48.833
Then where is she?

00:21:48.833 --> 00:21:52.566
I looked for Zuzu, but all I
could find was this one here.

00:21:54.033 --> 00:21:58.500
Sora, don't tell me your
friends took her away!

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.000
Sora!

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.133
You've all dueled well.

00:22:04.133 --> 00:22:06.366
Declan!

00:22:06.366 --> 00:22:08.066
Perfect timing, Declan!

00:22:08.066 --> 00:22:10.800
I got rid of all the Fusion
Dimension dweebs

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.566
just like you wanted me to.

00:22:12.566 --> 00:22:14.633
I therefore qualify
to join the elite,

00:22:14.633 --> 00:22:16.933
exclusive ranks
of the Lancers.

00:22:16.933 --> 00:22:18.900
The what‐cers?
Who're they?

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.666
This Battle Royal
was really a test.

00:22:21.666 --> 00:22:24.200
A test to see who
can cut it as a Lancer.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.900
Lancer?

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:09.433
