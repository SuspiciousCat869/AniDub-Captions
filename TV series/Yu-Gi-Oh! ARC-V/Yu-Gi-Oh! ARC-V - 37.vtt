WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.933
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.766
(Sora)
When my people
put their foot down

00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.000
and gained control
of the Xyz Dimension,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.966
they all fled like
rats on a sinking ship.

00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.000
We left so we could
fight another day

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.133
against those from
your Fusion Dimension!

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.433
Huh?

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:22.266
Aah! No!

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:26.300
Don't take me away!

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.433
I want you to tell me
where my friend Sora is!

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:31.966
He's home,
at Duel Academy.

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:35.200
They train
duel warriors there.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.866
Our homeland was attacked
by the Fusion Warriors...

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:43.133
They laid waste to my city.
As for my people...

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.566
they captured them by trapping
their souls into cards.

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.866
And there is more fighting
happening right now, Yuya.

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.766
For, you see, there are more
places beyond your world.

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.500
So let me get this straight
there are four dimensions‐‐

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.300
Fusion, Xyz, Synchro,
and Standard‐‐

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.133
and they're all fighting
each other? But why?

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.700
Why would the dimensions
all want to do this?

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.133
One man‐‐
Leo Akaba.

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.566
Huh?
What is that?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.266
Uh, would someone
mind telling me why

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:20.466
there's now another guy
who looks just like me?

Aren't there any other
cameras in that park?!

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:29.566
They're too far away
to lock onto the target!

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.566
Sora must have gone back
to the Fusion Dimension

00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:33.900
to gather reinforcements.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.700
He'll return
to take us all out.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.933
I should be there!

00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:39.433
Raise the energy
detection levels

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:41.333
around the perimeter
of the park.

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:43.633
If a large number
of duelists converge

00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:46.233
and try to launch an invasion,
we'll know it right away.

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:49.166
We can't just sit and watch,
we've got to do something!

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:55.500
This is my city. I'll be the
one to decide how to protect it.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.166
C'mon! What's the deal
here?! Why do you both look like
me?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.233
(cracking knuckles)

00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:17.866
Your loser buddies aren't here
to save you this time.

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:20.333
I demand a rematch,
here and now!

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:23.533
That's a laugh! I don't
need anybody to save me

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:26.300
from a fusion follower
like you, "No‐go"!

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.266
So your name's "No‐go"!?

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:31.500
I warned you before.
Don't call me "No‐go!"

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.300
The name's Yugo!

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.200
Yugo?

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.666
(computer voice)
Duel mode engaged.

00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:41.100
Autopilot activated.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.733
You're toast!

00:03:46.966 --> 00:03:48.900
Let's Duel!

00:03:51.466 --> 00:03:54.000
I strike first...
and hard!

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.866
(grunting)

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.166
You can run but you can't hide
from this sinister spinster.

00:04:01.166 --> 00:04:03.566
Say hello to
Speedroid Terrortop!

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.000
Whoa! His bike!
It's his Duel Disk, too!

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.500
And next, I'm rolling out

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.066
my Level 3 Tuner Monster
Speedroid Tri‐Eyed Dice.

00:04:21.066 --> 00:04:25.566
A Tuner Monster?!
Then he's a Syncro Summoner!

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:33.133
I tune Level 3 Tri‐Eyed Dice
with Level 3 Terrortop...

00:04:33.133 --> 00:04:36.000
to call forth
a mystical cross‐sword

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.133
with the power to cut
every enemy down to size!

00:04:40.133 --> 00:04:46.700
I Synchro Summon
Hi‐Speedroid Kendama!

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.700
Summoning energy detected!
Is it Fusion?

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.566
No. Syncro. Oh, my! It's
incredibly powerful, sir!

00:04:54.566 --> 00:04:56.466
Synchro energy?!

00:04:56.466 --> 00:04:58.266
How intriguing.

00:04:58.266 --> 00:05:02.033
It seems we have a new
visitor to Paradise City.

00:05:02.033 --> 00:05:04.833
I wonder if he is
friend or foe?

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:12.300
This guys appears out of
nowhere and he Syncro Summons?

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.600
So if what Yuto said is true,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.433
that there's
a Synchro Dimension...

00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:18.733
maybe he's from there.

00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:22.766
Now I activate Hi‐Speedroid
Kendama's special ability.

00:05:22.766 --> 00:05:25.200
By banishing one Speedroid
in my graveyard,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.433
you take 500 points
of damage!

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.900
(panting)

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.833
(groaning)

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:36.733
That's enough for now. I'll
give you a fighting chance.

00:05:36.733 --> 00:05:38.866
Yugo's a Synchro summoner!

00:05:38.866 --> 00:05:42.000
I thought Yuto's enemies
were Fusion Duelists!

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.200
It's my move!

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.266
I summon The Phantom
Knights of Ragged Gloves!

00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:53.066
And I think a pair of boots

00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:55.100
will go nicely
with my pair of gloves.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.200
I summon The Phantom
Knights of Silent Boots!

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.666
Keeping up? Hope so,
for your sake,

00:06:00.666 --> 00:06:02.700
because next
I overlay my Level 3

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:08.233
Phantom Knights of Ragged
Gloves and Silent Boots!

00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:11.066
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:06:11.066 --> 00:06:15.500
and Xyz Summon The Phantom
Knights of Break Sword!

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.700
Rise, my mighty beast!

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.400
Powerful Xyz Summon
energy detected!

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.900
And now it's Xyz.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.366
I don't understand
what's going on, sir.

00:06:28.366 --> 00:06:31.433
Fortunately, I do.
Yugo must be here.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.733
Yugo?

00:06:32.733 --> 00:06:34.533
He's from
the Synchro Dimension,

00:06:34.533 --> 00:06:37.000
but he's buddy buddy
with those Fusion freaks!

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.700
I know that no good "No‐go"
is battling Yuto right now!

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.700
I have to go help him!

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.166
I can't allow that.
Why not?!

00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:47.533
Because we don't know
if the Syncro Dimension

00:06:47.533 --> 00:06:49.233
is really our foe.

00:06:49.233 --> 00:06:51.000
It may be,
but if it's not,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.366
attacking this Yugo
will make them an enemy.

00:06:53.366 --> 00:06:55.366
I don't think
that's a wise move.

00:06:55.366 --> 00:06:58.100
Do I make myself
perfectly clear, Shay?

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.833
(growling)

00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:02.966
Since I used Ragged Gloves
to Xyz Summon,

00:07:02.966 --> 00:07:07.666
1,000 attack points
are added to my Break Sword.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.366
Now my Break Sword attack and
cut his Kendama down to size!

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.466
That wasn't very nice.

00:07:23.466 --> 00:07:26.700
That's a taste
of what's coming.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.500
Since my turn's done,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.900
Break Sword's attack
points go back to normal.

00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:36.200
Aw! That's really too bad.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.966
Bad for you, because I'm about
to run your life points down!

00:07:39.966 --> 00:07:43.966
(tires squealing)

00:07:43.966 --> 00:07:47.033
I activate the spell
Speed Recovery

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:49.433
and summon a Speedroid
from my graveyard!

00:07:49.433 --> 00:07:54.733
Welcome back,
Hi‐Speedroid Kendama!

00:07:54.733 --> 00:07:56.666
It's time to take to the sky!

00:07:56.666 --> 00:07:58.000
Huh!

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.066
Synchro style!

00:08:00.066 --> 00:08:04.666
First up, my Kendama's going
to take out your Break Sword!

00:08:08.466 --> 00:08:10.766
I don't think so, "Slow‐go"!

00:08:10.766 --> 00:08:14.066
I'm playing the trap
Phantom Sword!

00:08:14.066 --> 00:08:17.833
It gives Break Sword
an extra 800 attack points.

00:08:17.833 --> 00:08:20.733
Now Yuto's
got the upper hand.

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:22.266
I'm pulling a u'ey
on that move!

00:08:22.266 --> 00:08:25.600
I activate the trap
Speed Turn!

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.000
It switches Break Sword
to defense mode

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.100
and lowers its defense
points by 500!

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.066
Your Break Sword's
about to be broken!

00:08:35.066 --> 00:08:36.700
Wrong again.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.033
Your attack may have
shattered my Phantom Sword,

00:08:40.033 --> 00:08:42.433
but my monster
is safe and sound!

00:08:42.433 --> 00:08:45.633
I activate Kendama's
special ability!

00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:47.533
Your monster might be safe,

00:08:47.533 --> 00:08:49.633
but your life points
are a different story.

00:08:49.633 --> 00:08:52.833
And you and I both know
that's a game changer!

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:54.800
Aah!

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.333
Whoa, you guys
gotta chill out!

00:08:57.333 --> 00:08:59.866
(groaning)

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.700
I end my turn
with a facedown.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.533
Your move, if you actually
can move, that is.

00:09:11.533 --> 00:09:12.466
(groaning)

00:09:12.466 --> 00:09:13.933
Yuto!

00:09:13.933 --> 00:09:15.366
(groaning)

00:09:15.366 --> 00:09:16.433
Stay there.

00:09:16.433 --> 00:09:17.366
What?

00:09:17.366 --> 00:09:19.433
(groaning)

00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:21.166
I draw!

00:09:21.166 --> 00:09:25.000
I switch Break Sword
back to attack mode

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.200
and summon The Phantom
Knights of Ancient Cloak!

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.400
I activate
its special ability.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.433
By switching it
to defense mode,

00:09:34.433 --> 00:09:36.033
Break Sword gains
800 attack points

00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:39.833
until the end of my turn.

00:09:39.833 --> 00:09:42.900
Break Sword, smash that
Kendama into pieces!

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.933
I could use Tri‐Eyed Dice's
special ability

00:09:47.933 --> 00:09:51.300
from my graveyard
to block the attack, but...

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.533
(groaning)

00:09:57.666 --> 00:10:00.533
It appears the Sword is
mightier than the Kendama!

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:04.666
It's your move, if you
dare take it, "Lame‐o."

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.333
Oh, I'll take it,
just like you took

00:10:09.333 --> 00:10:11.633
the most important thing
in the world from me.

00:10:11.633 --> 00:10:13.800
You're the ones
who stole from me.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.700
Enough! We can talk about
who stole what after the duel.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.633
(tires squealing)

00:10:19.633 --> 00:10:20.700
My turn.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.300
Huh!

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:28.866
I summon
Speedroid Double Yoyo!

00:10:28.866 --> 00:10:34.666
And it lets me summon another
Speedroid from my graveyard!

00:10:34.666 --> 00:10:37.800
Welcome back to the battle,
my trusty Tri‐Eyed Dice!

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.033
(roaring)

00:10:40.033 --> 00:10:44.933
I know, you want to smash
this guy just as much as I do,

00:10:44.933 --> 00:10:46.933
so let's both
make this happen.

00:10:46.933 --> 00:10:50.933
All right, now I tune
my Level 3 Tri‐Eyed Dice

00:10:50.933 --> 00:10:53.766
with my Level 4
Double Yoyo!

00:11:00.533 --> 00:11:04.266
Beat your wings to whip up
a whirlwind of destruction!

00:11:04.266 --> 00:11:11.433
I Synchro Summon
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:11:11.433 --> 00:11:14.000
(roaring)

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.266
He's got a dragon too?
This is getting dangerous.

00:11:22.533 --> 00:11:26.733
I Synchro Summon
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:11:26.733 --> 00:11:29.166
(roaring)

00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:33.333
He's got a dragon too?
This is getting dangerous.

00:11:33.333 --> 00:11:34.566
Let's go!

00:11:34.566 --> 00:11:37.933
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon,
attack Break Sword!

00:11:37.933 --> 00:11:40.400
(roaring)

00:11:45.566 --> 00:11:47.000
(neighing)

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.100
(roaring)

00:11:54.933 --> 00:11:57.833
Spin Storm Sky Strike!

00:12:03.133 --> 00:12:04.700
Aah!

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.100
(groaning)

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.900
Yuto!

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.233
Stay away!
(grunting)

00:12:12.033 --> 00:12:15.733
Thanks to Break Sword's special
ability, when it's destroyed,

00:12:15.733 --> 00:12:19.033
I can bring back the two Phantom
Knights I used to summon it...

00:12:19.033 --> 00:12:20.666
but now they're Level 4.

00:12:24.766 --> 00:12:26.933
Huh! One good turn
deserves another,

00:12:26.933 --> 00:12:29.500
but this one's not gonna
turn out good for you!

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.366
I play the spell
Shock Surprise.

00:12:32.366 --> 00:12:34.766
By banishing Double Yoyo
from my graveyard,

00:12:34.766 --> 00:12:39.133
I can destroy
your Ancient Cloak!

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:40.700
(tires squealing)

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.966
I think I'll stop there.

00:12:42.966 --> 00:12:47.200
You know why I left you those
two monsters, so bring it out.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.833
My Clear Wing Synchro Dragon
is waiting for it.

00:12:50.833 --> 00:12:53.833
Let's see which of our dragons
is the strongest!

00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:56.800
Summon your
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.133
and let's
get this over with!

00:12:58.133 --> 00:12:59.600
You asked for it.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.200
(roaring)

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.166
I draw!

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:08.800
I overlay my Level 4
Ragged Gloves and Silent Boots!

00:13:12.466 --> 00:13:15.466
Cloaked in shadows and
relentless in its objective,

00:13:15.466 --> 00:13:18.733
I call upon the most
dangerous of dragons!

00:13:18.733 --> 00:13:23.266
I Xyz Summon
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:13:23.266 --> 00:13:31.200
(roaring)

00:13:35.066 --> 00:13:37.866
(groaning)

00:13:37.866 --> 00:13:40.000
Something's wrong with me!

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.433
My chest
feels like it's on fire!

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.200
(groaning)

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.800
(gasping)
Yuto?

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.000
You wanted to settle things.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.300
My Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon
will do just that.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.900
First, it'll destroy you.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.733
Then, it'll destroy
everything!

00:14:02.733 --> 00:14:04.866
Yuto.

00:14:04.866 --> 00:14:09.566
I activate Dark Rebellion Xyz
Dragon's special ability!

00:14:09.566 --> 00:14:12.466
By using one overlay unit,

00:14:12.466 --> 00:14:15.366
the attack points of
your dragon are cut in half!

00:14:15.366 --> 00:14:17.466
And then,
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon

00:14:17.466 --> 00:14:22.000
gains those attack points.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.433
That special ability

00:14:23.433 --> 00:14:26.200
cuts Yugo's clear wing
Synchro Dragon's attack points

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.733
down to 1,250,
and Yuto's

00:14:28.733 --> 00:14:33.900
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon's
attack points jump to 3,750!

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.300
That's only
if I let that happen!

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.633
My Synchro Dragon
also has a special ability!

00:14:40.633 --> 00:14:42.833
It puts the brakes
on your plan

00:14:42.833 --> 00:14:45.466
and it destroys
your dragon as well!

00:14:45.466 --> 00:14:47.900
Reverse revenge!

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.766
I activate
the Trap Phantom Wing!

00:14:50.766 --> 00:14:52.633
It saves my dragon

00:14:52.633 --> 00:14:57.900
and gives it an extra
500 attack points!

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.066
He survived...
and his dragon came out

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.533
even stronger than before!

00:15:01.533 --> 00:15:07.566
I'll finish you,
then destroy everything!

00:15:07.566 --> 00:15:08.966
Yuto!?

00:15:08.966 --> 00:15:13.733
I will spare nothing!
All will rot and crumble!

00:15:13.733 --> 00:15:14.866
Yugo!?

00:15:14.866 --> 00:15:17.766
Destruction!
Mass destruction!

00:15:17.766 --> 00:15:18.966
(gasping)

00:15:18.966 --> 00:15:21.600
Stop talking this way,
both of you!

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.833
Dueling's not about that!

00:15:23.833 --> 00:15:26.366
Dueling's about having fun,
not destroying stuff!

00:15:26.366 --> 00:15:28.400
Battle time!

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.466
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon,

00:15:30.466 --> 00:15:32.033

Synchro Dragon‐‐‐

It's like you forgot
what dueling is all about!

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.800
You're not supposed to
hurt each other!

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.633
It's not supposed to be a war!
Don't you get it?

00:15:40.633 --> 00:15:42.400
A duel makes people smile.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.466
It's supposed to make them
happy. Know how?

00:15:45.466 --> 00:15:48.700
Because it entertains them
and that's why they feel good!

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.566
You told me your people duel
for the simple joy of it all!

00:15:52.566 --> 00:15:54.566

isn't in your nature.

This is the end of the line!

00:16:22.733 --> 00:16:27.333
I summon Speedroid Razorang

00:16:31.333 --> 00:16:34.233
What're you doing?!
This has to stop!

00:16:34.233 --> 00:16:35.433
No, it doesn't!

I activate Razorang's
special ability.

00:16:37.933 --> 00:16:39.766
By switching it
to defense mode,

00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:44.166
one monster on the field
loses 300 attack points.

00:16:44.166 --> 00:16:47.066
C'mon, you gotta
stop fighting!

00:16:47.066 --> 00:16:49.566
Hurting Yuto's dragon isn't
going to change anything!

00:16:49.566 --> 00:16:51.266
Fine, then.
I use it to lower

Really?

00:16:54.866 --> 00:16:57.600
Yes. And that triggers
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon's

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.400
special ability,
destroying my Razorang.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.033

Not a chance!
Huh?

00:17:12.066 --> 00:17:14.100
You see, my dragon
gains points‐‐
