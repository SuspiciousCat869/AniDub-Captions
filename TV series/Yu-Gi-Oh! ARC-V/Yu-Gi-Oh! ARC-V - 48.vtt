00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:04.533
Previously on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh!
Arc‐V"...

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.266
For Celina to find out

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.366
what really happened
in the Xyz Dimension,

00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:09.933
she needs to meet Shay.

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.133
But to give her
that chance

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.266
I'll need to keep
these guys off her trail.

00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.000
(gasps)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.833
You're a dead ringer
for Lulu and Rin.

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:19.066
You know Lulu?

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.266
Does that mean you're
the one who took her?!

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.866
Right you are.

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.366
Where
did you take her?

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:27.100
The same place that I'm going
to be taking you.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.766
You are coming back
with me to my dimension

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.633
so I can deliver you
to the Professor.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:35.466
We need to gather more
reinforcements, sir.

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.733
The enemy we face
is a new breed,

00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:38.866
so in order
to defeat them

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.800
we need something new
ourselves.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.133
And in the dueling universe
there's nothing newer

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.300
than Pendulum Summoning,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.766
and there's no duelist
who knows it better

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:50.233
than
Yuya Sakaki.

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:51.800
Come on, get out
of the cold

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.333
and return with me
to see the Professor.

00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.333
Aaah!

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.033
What's this?

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.866
Agh! Rin!

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.700
You're safe!

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.133
Sorry,
wrong girl.

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.466
What's that?
Now what's happening?

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.700
Finish Shay!

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.533
And every single thing
that he fights for!

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.666
Aaaaah!

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:29.066
Oh, no!

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.700
How will I ever find out
the truth now?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.200

Ladies and gentlemen...

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.233
It is time!

00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:40.733
Time for the final showdown

00:02:40.733 --> 00:02:43.200
of this tournament's
Youth division!

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.833
And what a showdown
it has shaped up to be,

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:48.166
with Leo Institute's Riley
squaring off

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:51.166
against
You Show Duel School's Tate!

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:52.500
I can't wait...

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.666
And I don't have to, 'cause
the match is starting now!

00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:57.066
Stay on
your toes, Tate!

00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:59.066
Remember, Riley's
a double threat!

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:03.066
Ja, he's been known to
useboth Fusion und Synchro
styles!

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:05.066
Oh, I remember
all right.

00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:08.266
And that's why I have
a secret weapon to win this.

00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:10.633
One that Riley'll
never see coming...

00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:12.166
At least...
I hope.

00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:14.666
Wha‐‐?

00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:16.600
This should be
one great duel!

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.800
Too bad Zuzu and Yuya
aren't here.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.300
Yeah,
such a shame.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.500
But they have
their own duels to duel,

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.233
and Reed did mention
he'd go help Yuya

00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:25.966
before the feed
cut out!

00:03:25.966 --> 00:03:27.100
I wonder...

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.900
Wonder what?
Tell me!

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.733
If Reed Pepper‐‐

00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:33.533
Was going to serve up
a delish dish for him?

00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:35.066
Yuya's so lucky!

00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:37.233
I wish I needed help!
Ho ho!

00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:40.566
Huh?

00:03:50.933 --> 00:03:53.433
(grunting)

00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:03.333
Still think you're
the better duelist, Shay?

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.133
(moaning, groaning)

00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:09.466
Hey, you okay?

00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:12.433
(scoffing)
Oh, Zuzu.

00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:14.266
Don't bother trying
to help him.

00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:15.700
Shay's a big boy.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.066
He can take care
of himself.

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:19.433
Huh?

00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:22.566
That's a Fusion
Duel Disk... You're not Zuzu!

00:04:22.566 --> 00:04:27.166
It's time for us to play a
little game of hide and seek!

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:29.033
With the help
of Lunar Eclipse.

00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:31.700
Now you see
us...

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.733
Now you don't!

00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:35.300
If it's a game
you want to play...

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.300
Ready or not,
here I come!

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.900
(moaning)

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:54.600
Shay...

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.900
Cece, what are you doing
helping this Xyzian escape?

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.500
Our job's to take 'em down,
not nurse 'em back to health.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.266
Let us go.

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:16.700
(Shay moaning)

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.366
Get outta my way!

00:05:18.366 --> 00:05:20.066
That I will not do.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.200
Let's Duel!

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:28.766
What gives?

00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:30.533
Why are you helping us?

00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:32.900
Because my brother and I
have made a promise

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.700
for our ninja clan.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.833
And we always
honor our promises.

00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:41.233
Celina is absolutely critical
to our negotiations

00:05:41.233 --> 00:05:42.733
with Duel Academy.

00:05:42.733 --> 00:05:45.800
We must do whatever
it takes to protect her.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.633
What's her current
threat status?

00:05:47.633 --> 00:05:52.066
Including Sora Perse, there are
four enemy duelists on the hunt.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.100
Zuzu!

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.366
Where could she be?

00:05:58.366 --> 00:05:59.300
Come on, Aura!

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.233
Wake up!
It's us!

00:06:01.233 --> 00:06:02.800
Hey...
You hear me?

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800
Come on!

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.100
It's no use.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.166
She's completely out of it,
I just wish we knew why.

00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:10.833
I know this much,
we can't leave her like this.

00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:12.000
Right.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.566
But we can't just stay here
with her either.

00:06:14.566 --> 00:06:15.766
Brilliant thinking,
Trout.

00:06:15.766 --> 00:06:17.866
You carrying her out
is a great idea!

00:06:17.866 --> 00:06:19.033
Me?!

00:06:19.033 --> 00:06:20.466
Aw, me and
my big mouth!

00:06:27.766 --> 00:06:29.333
I have
excellent news!

00:06:29.333 --> 00:06:31.133
Celina is
down there.

00:06:31.133 --> 00:06:32.666
Then we'll take it
from here.

00:06:32.666 --> 00:06:34.300
Indeed you will,
gentlemen.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.600
After all, for now it's best
I remain behind the scenes.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.800
Celina.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.500
We've been looking
for you for some time.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.566
But now the game's up.
You're coming with us.

00:06:47.566 --> 00:06:50.566
Yeah? Just come on over here
and try and make me.

00:06:52.866 --> 00:06:55.233
Guess we'll be doing
this the hard way.

00:06:58.033 --> 00:06:59.933
Let's Duel!

00:06:59.933 --> 00:07:01.066
Ready?

00:07:01.066 --> 00:07:03.933
I summon Edge Imp Saw!

00:07:06.033 --> 00:07:09.633
You know I'm going to cut you
down to size, don't you?

00:07:09.633 --> 00:07:10.766
We shall see!

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:14.866
Allow me to go first.

00:07:14.866 --> 00:07:17.600
I summon one who bridges
daylight and darkness,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.600
Twilight
Ninja Shingetsu!

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.566
Then I will end my turn
with three facedowns!

00:07:24.733 --> 00:07:26.400
It's my move then!

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.066
Be warned!

00:07:28.066 --> 00:07:30.133
Its bite is worse
than its bark!

00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:31.433
Come on out!

00:07:31.433 --> 00:07:34.400
Ancient Gear
Hunting Hound!

00:07:35.033 --> 00:07:36.533
And so now...

00:07:36.533 --> 00:07:38.433
Since you have
a monster out...

00:07:38.433 --> 00:07:41.933
My Hunting Hound can dish out
600 points of damage

00:07:41.933 --> 00:07:43.566
thanks to
its ability!

00:07:43.566 --> 00:07:44.733
Canine Cannon!

00:07:44.733 --> 00:07:46.600
I activate a trap!

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.066
My Barrier Ninjitsu Art
of Extinguishment

00:07:49.066 --> 00:07:50.633
builds
a blockading breeze

00:07:50.633 --> 00:07:53.400
to blow out your
Hunting Hound's flames.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.533
So what?

00:07:54.533 --> 00:07:56.366
I've got something bigger
planned for you.

00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:58.766
I play the spell
Polymerization!

00:07:58.766 --> 00:08:02.733
And with it, I'll fuse three
Ancient Gear Hunting Hounds!

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.900
Watch as the fury
of the pack

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.533
takes the shape
of a single raging beast!

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.400
I Fusion Summon Triple
Ancient Gear Hunting Hound!

00:08:24.233 --> 00:08:25.533
Attack!
Stay!

00:08:25.533 --> 00:08:27.333
I play a trap!

00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:30.066
Barrier Ninjitsu Art
of Gathering Shadows!

00:08:30.066 --> 00:08:32.900
I can end the battle, making
your pooch turn tail

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.100
by paying half
of my life points.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.333
You what?

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.533
You okay?

00:08:40.533 --> 00:08:43.400
As I told you before, I made
a promise to protect Celina,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.833
and this is but a small
sacrifice to make.

00:08:45.833 --> 00:08:47.300
Blast!

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.266
I place two cards facedown
and end my turn!

00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:51.966
Witness this, Sora.

00:08:51.966 --> 00:08:54.833
The spell Ninjitsu Art
of Hazy Duplication

00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:57.500
allows me to call
upon a ninja!

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.533
So rise,
Twilight Ninja Shingetsu!

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.600
Ninja sminja.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.933
I Fusion Summon

00:09:07.933 --> 00:09:10.300
Triple Ancient Gear
Hunting Hound!

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.100
Sic 'em!

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.833
Once again, due to my
trap card's effect,

00:09:17.833 --> 00:09:21.366
by paying half my life points,
I can put a stop to your attack!

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.200
I tribute Twilight Ninja
Shingetsu so that I can summon

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.266
Twilight Ninja Nichirin,
the Chunin!

00:09:32.566 --> 00:09:34.433
I'm adding to the pack!

00:09:34.433 --> 00:09:38.566
I Fusion Summon another Triple
Ancient Gear Hunting Hound!

00:09:41.733 --> 00:09:44.900
I, again, activate
my trap card!

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.566
(moaning)

00:09:46.566 --> 00:09:47.700
Curses!

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.033
I place three cards facedown
and end my turn!

00:09:51.033 --> 00:09:52.533
(moaning)

00:09:52.533 --> 00:09:54.433
Are you okay?

00:09:54.433 --> 00:09:56.800
That... does
not matter.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.366
My brother and I
will not be defeated.

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:04.766
We will fight until we no longer
can, no matter what cost to us.

00:10:05.966 --> 00:10:09.366
Well, it's time
to show what I can do!

00:10:09.366 --> 00:10:11.500
No way, Shay.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.100
Keep resting up
while I play this!

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.733
Polymerization!

00:10:16.733 --> 00:10:21.433
I fuse Lunalight Blue Cat and
Lunalight Purple Butterfly!

00:10:21.433 --> 00:10:24.300
By combining the reflexes
of a fierce feline

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.966
with the fluttering fury
of a nighttime huntress,

00:10:26.966 --> 00:10:30.000
I can create a new
lunar legend!

00:10:31.833 --> 00:10:34.233
I Fusion Summon!

00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:36.766
Lunalight Cat Dancer!

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.033
Impressive.

00:10:43.033 --> 00:10:44.666
Then again, I would expect
nothing less

00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:47.000
from a student
of Duel Academy.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.966
Oh!

00:10:50.966 --> 00:10:52.000
Look there!

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.500
A duel!

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.066
Think those are the
troublemakers Yuya spoke of?

00:10:56.066 --> 00:10:57.800
I dunno
but I know this:

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.600
I really don't want
to have to find out!

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.800
I activate the spell
Lunalight Perfume!

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.200
It's truly a refreshing scent‐‐
so refreshing, in fact,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.333
that I can bring back Lunalight
Blue Cat to pounce and play!

00:11:11.333 --> 00:11:14.233
And by summoning Lunalight Blue
Cat to the field,

00:11:14.233 --> 00:11:18.466
she's gonna double up the attack
points of Lunalight Cat Dancer!

00:11:20.666 --> 00:11:23.566
Sharpened steel
and ruler of the jungle,

00:11:23.566 --> 00:11:27.100
when the two come together,
prepare to rumble!

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.900
I
Fusion Summon...

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.233
Frightfur Leo!

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.666
Sora!

00:11:46.133 --> 00:11:47.800
Huh?

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.633
(groans)

00:11:49.633 --> 00:11:51.733
Time for the sun
to set on this duel,

00:11:51.733 --> 00:11:54.966
so I can get back to
hunting down Shay!

00:11:58.533 --> 00:11:59.900
It's time to pounce!

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.933
I activate Cat Dancer's
ability!

00:12:02.933 --> 00:12:05.933
By tributing
Lunalight Blue Cat...

00:12:05.933 --> 00:12:09.433
My Cat Dancer can attack each
of your monsters twice!

00:12:09.433 --> 00:12:12.966
Go Cat Dancer, attack
Triple Gear Hunting Hound!

00:12:12.966 --> 00:12:15.066
Nice try...
But your cat's...

00:12:15.066 --> 00:12:16.466
Getting
declawed!

00:12:16.466 --> 00:12:18.966
Uh‐oh...
What is that?

00:12:18.966 --> 00:12:20.600
The trap
Fusion Dispersal

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.333
splits your Fusion monster
back into two,

00:12:23.333 --> 00:12:24.833
and you
take damage equal

00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:27.666
to the one with the greater
attack points!

00:12:38.033 --> 00:12:40.900
Celina, you don't stand
a chance against us.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.866
We're Fusion duelists,
just like you.

00:12:43.866 --> 00:12:45.933
So we know
all your moves!

00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:47.000
We gotta help!

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.066
You nuts?

00:12:48.066 --> 00:12:49.600
What can
we do?

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.466
Besides, none of those duelists
are even in the tournament.

00:12:52.466 --> 00:12:55.733
Some things mean more
than tournaments.

00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:57.066
You're right.

00:12:57.066 --> 00:13:00.000
Helping out in this duel's
the right thing to do...

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.933
is something
I'd never say!

00:13:02.933 --> 00:13:03.966
Sora!

00:13:03.966 --> 00:13:05.466
Sora, over here!

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.100
I know you
can hear me.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.533
Why are you
shutting me out?

00:13:10.533 --> 00:13:12.833
Come on, talk
to me already!

00:13:12.833 --> 00:13:15.000
Gong heard you're turning
people into cards!

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.733
That's not the Sora
Gong once knew!

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.033
At least look at us!

00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:22.133
Sora!

00:13:22.133 --> 00:13:23.866
Fine, I'm looking.
Happy?

00:13:23.866 --> 00:13:25.066
Now get lost.

00:13:25.066 --> 00:13:26.700
I don't think so!

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.233
(Gong)
Wait, Yuya!

00:13:29.233 --> 00:13:30.900
It's too dangerous!
Let go of me!

00:13:32.466 --> 00:13:34.266
Look there!
Huh, look where?

00:13:34.266 --> 00:13:35.700
It's Zuzu!

00:13:39.966 --> 00:13:41.000
Whoa!

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.300
Keep your eyes peeled,
it's their move.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.700
Now, let's go!

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:48.633
Yeah, go home!

00:13:50.233 --> 00:13:52.566
Mind
if we join?

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.300
(computer)
<i>Intrusion penalty.</i>

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.933
2,000 life
points.

00:13:57.933 --> 00:13:59.500
Huh?

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.566
(screaming)

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.700
Now...
It's my draw!

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.666
And first
I'll whip up

00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:11.666
the scrumptious spell
Minute Meal!

00:14:11.666 --> 00:14:12.933
Which means...

00:14:12.933 --> 00:14:15.533
I can summon as many
Royal Cookpals as I like

00:14:15.533 --> 00:14:18.933
as long as their total Level
is less than your monsters'!

00:14:18.933 --> 00:14:22.700
In other words, so long as all
my monsters don't surpass 21,

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.466
they're in the mix!

00:14:24.466 --> 00:14:27.266
So, Royal Cookpal
Knight Pasta,

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:29.466
Royal
Cookpal Queen Omelet,

00:14:29.466 --> 00:14:33.466
and Royal Cookpal King Burger,
welcome to the table!

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:37.833
I'll then throw a facedown
to end my turn!

00:14:37.833 --> 00:14:41.566
Ha! You're not a card slinger,
you're just some crazy cook!

00:14:41.566 --> 00:14:44.233
And we'll be cooking your
life points soon enough!

00:14:44.233 --> 00:14:46.966
Isn't that
right, Trout?

00:14:46.966 --> 00:14:49.666
Hey, your pat made me
pull a card!

00:14:49.666 --> 00:14:52.300
Still,
it's a favorite so...

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.766
Here we go!

00:14:53.766 --> 00:14:56.533
The spell Inlet lowers the Level
of a Water Attribute monster

00:14:56.533 --> 00:14:59.733
in my hand by 1,
so that lets me summon

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:01.966
the Legendary
Fisherman!

00:15:07.633 --> 00:15:11.266
Then, by tributing him, I can
summon an even bigger catch,

00:15:11.266 --> 00:15:13.366
the Legendary
Fisherman III!

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.266
And when this monster is
summoned to the field,

00:15:22.266 --> 00:15:25.733
I can banish from your field
as many monsters as I like!

00:15:25.733 --> 00:15:26.666
Say what?

00:15:26.666 --> 00:15:28.100
You heard me!

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.733
Now scoop up those pooches so
we can take 'em to the pound!

00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:37.033
Way to reel them
in there, Trout.

00:15:37.033 --> 00:15:39.333
And way to set
the table for this!

00:15:39.333 --> 00:15:41.133
The trap card
Monster Pie!

00:15:41.133 --> 00:15:44.566
Me and my Cookpals are cooking
up a succulent celebration

00:15:44.566 --> 00:15:46.400
where you get
a munchy Monster Pie

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.000
for every Hunting Hound
that you lost!

00:15:52.066 --> 00:15:53.133
Nasty!

00:15:54.466 --> 00:15:57.000
Don't get full yet,
'cause I've got more!

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.133
By returning my three Royal
Cookpals to my hand,

00:16:00.133 --> 00:16:02.566
I get to destroy
three monsters!

00:16:02.566 --> 00:16:04.466
Squash those pies!

00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:08.633
Let me add some sauce
to that appetizer!

00:16:08.633 --> 00:16:11.233
By sending your Hunting Hounds
to the graveyard,

00:16:11.233 --> 00:16:15.066
the Legendary Fisherman III
doubles the damage you take!

00:16:15.066 --> 00:16:17.666
For every Monster Pie
that was destroyed,

00:16:17.666 --> 00:16:20.966
you would've been served
up 1,000 points of damage.

00:16:20.966 --> 00:16:22.900
But now‐‐
It'll be doubled!

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.000
To 2,000
points!

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.200
Thanks to The Legendary
Fisherman III's special
ability!

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.866
Talk about teamwork.

00:16:29.866 --> 00:16:31.033
You reel 'em in...

00:16:31.033 --> 00:16:33.566
That's right,
and you cook 'em up!

00:16:33.566 --> 00:16:35.866
(opponent laughing)

00:16:35.866 --> 00:16:38.200
Enjoy your little
victory.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.533
Because it will be the last one
you two ever experience again!

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:42.533
Huh?

00:16:42.533 --> 00:16:45.200
I activate
all my facedowns!

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.700
First up is Ancient Gear
Reborn,

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.566
Next
is Ancient Gear Spark Shot

00:16:50.566 --> 00:16:53.366
and last but not least,
Ancient Gear Booster!

00:16:54.366 --> 00:16:56.133
Due to
Gear Reborn's effect,

00:16:56.133 --> 00:16:59.533
I can resurrect Triple Ancient
Gear Hunting Hound

00:16:59.533 --> 00:17:02.200
and give it
an extra 200 points of bite!

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.233
Ancient Gear Spark Shot deals
you damage equal to half

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:07.566
of Triple Hunting Hound's
attack points,

00:17:07.566 --> 00:17:10.366
but Ancient Gear Booster
gives it a power boost

00:17:10.366 --> 00:17:12.266
and doubles
the damage!

00:17:12.266 --> 00:17:15.833
Which means 2,000 points
of pain will now...

00:17:15.833 --> 00:17:17.600
Ruff you up!

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.500
I'm cooked!

00:17:26.733 --> 00:17:30.600
Aaaah!

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.566
Reed!

00:17:35.766 --> 00:17:37.233
Oh...

00:17:43.133 --> 00:17:45.300
Oh, no!

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.700
Ha ha ha!

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.366
Now that's what
I call well‐done.

00:17:49.366 --> 00:17:51.233
I'd say his cooking days
are through.

00:17:56.733 --> 00:17:58.600
Oh, no!
Poor Reed!

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.300
Now, they're gonna pay!
Haaa!

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.433
Sora!

00:18:03.433 --> 00:18:05.200
You're the leader
of this team, right?

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.800
So put a stop to this!

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.033
I don't have
to stop nothing!

00:18:10.033 --> 00:18:11.900
(angry yelling)

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.500
Hope you got a good look
at that, because you're next!

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.833
Ancient Gear combo is gonna
sink you once and for all!

00:18:18.833 --> 00:18:20.033
And that's too bad,

00:18:20.033 --> 00:18:21.600
because you won't
be the one

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.033
who gets to swim away
to fight another day!

00:18:40.433 --> 00:18:43.500
Well,
n the bright side, Reed...

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.500
At least the team'll
be reunited.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.033
Ha ha ha ha!

00:18:50.033 --> 00:18:52.800
Yes, reunited
for all eternity!

00:18:55.833 --> 00:18:58.866
(angry yelling)

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.733
There's nowhere
left to hide!

00:19:06.733 --> 00:19:09.300
Your fate's in the claws
of Frightfur Leo!

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.766
And that's bad news
for you

00:19:10.766 --> 00:19:15.400
'cause Leo's looking to buzz and
bash your last line of defense!

00:19:29.566 --> 00:19:33.300
(screaming)

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.233
(screaming)

00:19:58.033 --> 00:20:00.166
(screaming)

00:20:01.633 --> 00:20:04.033
Sora!

00:20:04.033 --> 00:20:07.100
I believe
it's your turn...

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.866
Your turn to go down,
that is!

00:20:08.866 --> 00:20:11.133
I activate
Ancient Gear Reborn!

00:20:11.133 --> 00:20:14.166
And just like before, I can
bring back a more powerful

00:20:14.166 --> 00:20:16.433
Triple Ancient Gear
Hunting Hound!

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.800
Then I'll activate
my facedown, too!

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.700
The trap card Ancient
Gear Spark Shot!

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.033
And by now, I'm sure you know
how the rest goes!

00:20:27.033 --> 00:20:29.900
Say goodbye!

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.000
Not so fast!

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.933
Sylvio's stepping in with the
Action Spell Flame Guard!

00:20:36.933 --> 00:20:40.166
Now your Hound's attack
is snuffed out!

00:20:40.166 --> 00:20:41.800
(gasps)

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.500
That's right, everyone,
it really is me!

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.466
I'm here to save the day
and nothing'll stop me.

00:20:47.466 --> 00:20:48.600
Huh?

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.800
Intrusion penalty,
2,000 Life Points.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.200
(screaming)

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.900
Okay, this might
stop me!

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.533
(screaming)

00:21:00.666 --> 00:21:02.266
Now,
where was I?

00:21:02.266 --> 00:21:04.766
Oh yeah, about to save
everyone!

00:21:04.766 --> 00:21:06.833
Do I have time
for a nap first?

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.166
Sora!

00:21:13.266 --> 00:21:14.533
Sora!

00:21:14.533 --> 00:21:16.200
What you're doing is wrong!

00:21:19.933 --> 00:21:22.833
Yuya...
it's up to you...

00:21:22.833 --> 00:21:27.000
to use your power...
to fight off the darkness...

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.633
to make the whole
world smile...

00:21:30.966 --> 00:21:32.200
That's right.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.600
Sora,
you're dueling me.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.733
Sure, Yuya.

00:21:38.733 --> 00:21:40.233
But
let's duel somewhere

00:21:40.233 --> 00:21:42.800
where these lame‐os won't be
able to bother us.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.033
Because I wouldn't want anyone
to interrupt our duel.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.966
You've forgotten
what dueling is all about,

00:22:00.966 --> 00:22:04.833
but I'll make you remember,
no matter what it takes!

00:22:04.833 --> 00:22:06.333
Here we go!
Here we go!

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:10.433
