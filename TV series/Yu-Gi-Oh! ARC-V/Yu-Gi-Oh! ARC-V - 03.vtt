Gong's so
proud of you.

Your obsession with
Pendulum Summoning

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:11.033
just reached
an all‐time low.

00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:12.566
You'll have to show up
to our next math class

00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:14.500
with a paper bag
on your head.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.833
A paper bag.

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:17.600
That's not
a bad idea.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.100
I'd get some
huge laughs.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.166
I think you've gotten enough
laughs in school.

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:22.166
Huh?
Huh?

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:24.200
(all)
Hurray for Yuya!

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.366
What's up, guys?

00:03:25.366 --> 00:03:28.533
Gong told us you finally
Pendulum Summoned again.

00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:29.900
Is it really true?

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.466
You bet!

00:03:31.466 --> 00:03:33.033
I'll show you
at the duel school.

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:34.300
Awesome!

00:03:37.933 --> 00:03:40.633
Triple bull's‐eye!

00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:41.866
(boy)
Impressed?

00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:45.233
I assure you, that was
mere child's play.

00:03:45.233 --> 00:03:47.400
I could have done it
blind‐folded.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.233
Uh, who are you?

00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:52.666
Me? Merely one of
your biggest fans.

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:54.933
To be precise,
the name's Sylvio.

00:03:54.933 --> 00:03:56.200
It's an honor.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.633
Oh, hi.

00:03:57.633 --> 00:04:00.066
I caught your duel against
the Sledgehammer on TV.

00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:01.800
You were
tres magnifique!

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.333
Oh, allow me.

00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:06.800
Your new Pendulum Summoning
technique took my breath away.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.266
And those cards
you used‐‐

00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:10.966
Sorry, what do you
call them, Yuya, hmm?

00:04:10.966 --> 00:04:12.800
You mean,
my Pendulum Cards?

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.233
Precisely.

00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:16.700
I'd be interested in learning
how you acquired them.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.433
Only a duelist
of the highest caliber

00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:20.800
could possibly possess
such rare cards.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.666
There's no need
to pump up his ego.

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:25.266
It's already about to
burst as it is.

00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:28.466
Seriously, you're a
sensational duelist, Yuya.

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:31.366
Hey, Yuya, remember your
promise to Tate.

00:04:31.366 --> 00:04:34.433
You're showing him and our
friends how to Pendulum Summon.

00:04:34.433 --> 00:04:35.900
That's right,
I almost forgot!

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.233
If you're planning
to demonstrate

00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:38.633
your Pendulum technique,

00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:41.266
then I have access
to a most an ideal venue.

00:04:41.266 --> 00:04:43.366
An hour from now you could
showcase your talents

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:44.833
at the Leo Institute.

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:47.333
You'll take center stage
on their center court.

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:50.533
I thought that was
for Leo students only.

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:52.533
He can't duel there!

00:04:52.533 --> 00:04:54.233
(Sylvio)
I've already reserved the space.

00:04:54.233 --> 00:04:56.633
I happen to be one of
the school's top students.

00:04:56.633 --> 00:04:59.333
My father is also expected
to be the city's next mayor,

00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:02.966
so I definitely have influence
with the school's higher‐ups.

00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:05.533
Letting Yuya duel there
is an amazing honor.

00:05:05.533 --> 00:05:07.133
Can we come along?

00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:09.100
Pretty please?
We'll be your best friends.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.733
(growling)

00:05:10.733 --> 00:05:14.300
I don't see why Yuya can't do
his demo at our school.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.000
It shall be
a new experience.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.466
Plus I heard the Leo Institute
has a great snack bar!

00:05:18.466 --> 00:05:19.633
We got to check it out!

00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:22.000
Uh‐huh!
Uh‐huh!

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.900
Fine then, but I'm
coming along, too.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.200
As the only loyal student
from You Show,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.866
I think I'd better
check out our top competitor.

00:05:28.866 --> 00:05:30.033
(cheering)

00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:32.900
You're all more than
welcome to join us.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.733
And now, au revoir!

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:36.933
Come, hurry!

00:05:36.933 --> 00:05:38.900
It's not like we're
going to a toy store.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.200
Calm down!

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:45.300
It's all going
according to plan.

00:05:58.893 --> 00:06:00.893
(Sylvio)
On behalf of my fellow students,

00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:04.093
welcome to the Leo Institute
of Dueling.

00:06:06.993 --> 00:06:09.727
(general conversations)

00:06:20.893 --> 00:06:22.060
As you probably know,

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.127
the Institute is managed
by the Leo Corporation.

00:06:25.127 --> 00:06:26.860
They've spared no expense
to turn our school

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.527
into one of the world's
top dueling institutions.

00:06:29.527 --> 00:06:33.093
Yes, we have
only the best.

00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:35.060
This place produced
lots of champions.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.727
I know!

00:06:36.727 --> 00:06:38.927
That's why they're
the top of the top.

00:06:38.927 --> 00:06:41.227
I heard that they have
the best equipment here, too.

00:06:41.227 --> 00:06:42.960
(Sylvio)
Our faculty always says

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.160
that if you want to achieve
excellence,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.093
you must surround
yourself with excellence,

00:06:48.093 --> 00:06:49.327
It's just like
at You Show,

00:06:49.327 --> 00:06:52.227
but we surround ourselves
with mediocrity.

00:06:52.227 --> 00:06:54.260
I've heard that
You Show's an okay school.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.793
Thanks for
the compliment.

00:06:55.793 --> 00:06:57.693
I guess your school's
better at everything.

00:06:57.693 --> 00:06:59.527
No, not at everything.

00:06:59.527 --> 00:07:01.393
My mom says You Show
is a lot cheaper.

00:07:01.393 --> 00:07:02.427
(chuckling)

00:07:02.427 --> 00:07:03.760
(Yuya)
I've gotta admit,

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.760
this place has a lot of things
our school can't offer.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.693
Their classes
are unbelievable.

00:07:08.693 --> 00:07:11.660
You can learn Xyz Summoning,
Synchro Summoning‐‐

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.760
Whoa! They even
teach Fusion Summoning.

00:07:25.193 --> 00:07:26.793
(girl)
Yuya!

00:07:26.793 --> 00:07:29.260
The central dueling zone
is this way.

00:07:32.427 --> 00:07:34.693
(gasping)

00:07:34.693 --> 00:07:36.193
(boy)
Unglaublich!

00:07:36.193 --> 00:07:38.760
This is the coolest
dueling zone I ever saw!

00:07:44.527 --> 00:07:45.960
Hey.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.927
These gents have also
become big fans of yours.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:52.227
They're curious about the cards
you use to Pendulum Summon.

00:07:52.227 --> 00:07:54.960
You wouldn't mind letting
them have a look, would you?

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.060
Show them my cards?

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.760
No need to worry,
they're best buds with me.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.393
Well, okay.

00:08:02.393 --> 00:08:04.160
Here they‐‐ ah!

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.193
See?

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:06.760
Amazing!
That's radical!

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.227
So, I can Pendulum Summon
with these cards?

00:08:08.227 --> 00:08:10.260
Whoa...
This one's mine!

00:08:11.927 --> 00:08:13.327
Gentlemen, please.

00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:15.860
You can't have
these Pendulum cards,

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.460
they aren't yours...

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.827
(boys moaning)

00:08:18.827 --> 00:08:19.993
They're mine.

00:08:19.993 --> 00:08:22.493
I'm adding them
to my rare card collection!

00:08:22.493 --> 00:08:23.493
Huh?

00:08:23.493 --> 00:08:25.193
That's not amusing,
Sylvio.

00:08:25.193 --> 00:08:27.127
(Sylvio)
I wasn't being funny.

00:08:27.127 --> 00:08:28.927
I happen to prefer
rare cards.

00:08:28.927 --> 00:08:32.193
In my opinion, they're the only
cards that are worth collecting.

00:08:32.193 --> 00:08:36.327
Your cards are so unique
that I simply can't resist them.

00:08:36.327 --> 00:08:37.893
(laughing)

00:08:37.893 --> 00:08:40.127
Oh, so that's why you invited
Yuya to your school.

00:08:40.127 --> 00:08:41.860
It's not the only reason.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.027
Naturally, I need to learn
how to use the cards.

00:08:45.027 --> 00:08:47.660
You still want Yuya to show you
how to Pendulum Summon, right?

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.760
For sure!

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.160
I can't wait.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.093
That's why I reserved the main
Duel Zone for our showdown.

00:08:54.093 --> 00:08:56.060
Well, you're gonna
have to call and cancel.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.493
Excuse me?

00:08:57.493 --> 00:08:59.993
After I went to
all this trouble?

00:08:59.993 --> 00:09:03.393
You better snap to it.

00:09:03.393 --> 00:09:04.427
You okay, Yuya?

00:09:04.427 --> 00:09:05.627
Yeah.

00:09:05.627 --> 00:09:06.793
I don't want to
get rough,

00:09:06.793 --> 00:09:08.660
so I suggest you get
your head in the game

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.327
and your deck in order.

00:09:10.327 --> 00:09:11.827
(computer beeping)

00:09:11.827 --> 00:09:13.427
(man on computer)
Dueling wasn't part
of the plan.

00:09:13.427 --> 00:09:15.127
You were ordered
to retrieve the cards

00:09:15.127 --> 00:09:17.460
and bring them to us
immediately.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.560
(scoffs)

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.360
That was your plan.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.793
But my priorities are a little
different, understand?

00:09:22.793 --> 00:09:25.560
I plan to keep these
rare cards for myself.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.260
Do not try to defy us!

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.927
Report here immediately
with the cards‐‐

00:09:28.927 --> 00:09:31.060
(man)
No, let him be.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.327
Mr. President.

00:09:34.327 --> 00:09:35.993
Do not interfere
with Sylvio.

00:09:38.593 --> 00:09:39.727
(Sylvio)
Now, let's get on with it.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.393
What are you doing?

00:09:44.393 --> 00:09:45.960
(screaming)

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.593
(all)
Yuya, help us!

00:09:48.593 --> 00:09:51.460
Sylvio, tell them to
let my friends go!

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.060
Your friends
are perfectly safe‐‐

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.727
at least they are
for the moment,

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:56.827
until our duel
gets underway.

00:09:56.827 --> 00:09:58.327
What do you mean?

00:09:58.327 --> 00:09:59.727
You'll see.

00:09:59.727 --> 00:10:02.293
By the way, I have
something for you.

00:10:02.293 --> 00:10:05.593
I'm offering these in exchange
for your Pendulum cards.

00:10:05.593 --> 00:10:09.193
I knew you'd like them because
they're worthless, like you!

00:10:09.193 --> 00:10:10.293
(laughing)

00:10:14.593 --> 00:10:16.193
No card's worthless.

00:10:19.027 --> 00:10:21.227
But this isn't exactly
a fair trade.

00:10:24.027 --> 00:10:25.693
(man)
Are you sure about this, sir?

00:10:25.693 --> 00:10:28.593
I am.
Allow him to proceed.

00:10:28.593 --> 00:10:30.593
Now I'll select
an Action Field.

00:10:30.593 --> 00:10:32.793
Let's hope your pals aren't
scared of heights,

00:10:32.793 --> 00:10:37.627
because my choice of field
will take them all sky high!

00:10:37.627 --> 00:10:40.160
I choose Prison Tower
of Darkville.

00:10:50.127 --> 00:10:53.260
(woman on computer)Augmented
reality combat system energized.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.793
<i>Generating action field.</i>

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.827
(screaming)

00:10:58.827 --> 00:11:01.093
(all screaming)

00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:02.793
Zuzu!

00:11:02.793 --> 00:11:05.293
(screaming)

00:11:05.293 --> 00:11:06.827
It would be
a terrible waste

00:11:06.827 --> 00:11:09.627
to have a Prison Tower without
prisoners, don't you think?

00:11:16.193 --> 00:11:17.727
Hang on, guys!

00:11:17.727 --> 00:11:19.860
Yuya!

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.827
Don't panic!
I'll get you down!

00:11:33.254 --> 00:11:36.288
Don't panic!
I'll get you down!

00:11:36.288 --> 00:11:38.521
None of this is
really real, right?

00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:40.454
The ARC system here
is fully interactive,

00:11:40.454 --> 00:11:43.121
so if we fall, it will feel
real enough.

00:11:43.121 --> 00:11:45.354
I think it's better
if we don't test it out!

00:11:45.354 --> 00:11:46.454
(screaming)

00:11:50.554 --> 00:11:51.854
I'm coming, guys!

00:11:51.854 --> 00:11:53.288
(Sylvio)
You want to save your friends?

00:11:53.288 --> 00:11:56.054
Then give me
what I want.

00:11:56.054 --> 00:11:57.254
Duel me now.

00:11:57.254 --> 00:11:58.321
All right, then.

00:12:21.621 --> 00:12:24.321
We're going to duel until
I learn what I need to.

00:12:24.321 --> 00:12:27.821
And after that,
I'll crush you!

00:12:27.821 --> 00:12:31.054
Now, you're gonna show us
how to Pendulum Summon!

00:12:31.054 --> 00:12:34.688
Sylvio already snagged your
precious Pendulum cards.

00:12:34.688 --> 00:12:36.488
And next he's gonna pick
your puny brain!

00:12:36.488 --> 00:12:37.954
That's right.

00:12:37.954 --> 00:12:40.221
I plan on becoming
a Pendulum Master,

00:12:40.221 --> 00:12:43.288
and you'll be
my teacher!

00:12:43.288 --> 00:12:44.521
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:12:47.621 --> 00:12:50.788
(woman on computer)
<i>Action cards dispersed.</i>

00:12:50.788 --> 00:12:52.688
All right,
it's show time!

00:12:59.421 --> 00:13:01.454
Performapal Whip Snake,
whip into shape.

00:13:07.254 --> 00:13:09.454
Quick‐‐ let's swing
into action!

00:13:17.888 --> 00:13:20.321
Your move, Sylvio.

00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:22.188
Run, twerp.

00:13:22.188 --> 00:13:23.221
Ha!

00:13:29.054 --> 00:13:30.988
Perfect.

00:13:30.988 --> 00:13:32.921
(President)
No.

00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:35.154
It's not time
for that card yet.

00:13:35.154 --> 00:13:38.321
Listen, I don't know who
youare, but don't interfere!

00:13:38.321 --> 00:13:39.388
You will obey me.

00:13:42.788 --> 00:13:43.988
It doesn't matter.

00:13:43.988 --> 00:13:46.654
I'll save this monster
for the final blow.

00:13:46.654 --> 00:13:48.721
Instead I'll pick

00:13:48.721 --> 00:13:51.954
something to give
my game a little lift.

00:13:51.954 --> 00:13:53.654
Lightning Hoverboard!

00:14:05.788 --> 00:14:08.354
You aren't going to save your
friends this way, Yuya.

00:14:08.354 --> 00:14:12.021
In fact, you're only going to
get them into deeper danger.

00:14:13.988 --> 00:14:15.221
Yah!

00:14:17.388 --> 00:14:18.321
Ahh!

00:14:22.954 --> 00:14:25.121
Gotta be here someplace.

00:14:25.121 --> 00:14:26.588
I knew it‐‐
an Action Card!

00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:32.454
It's a trap!

00:14:32.454 --> 00:14:36.421
Indeed it is,
and it just snared you.

00:14:36.421 --> 00:14:37.188
Huh?

00:14:37.188 --> 00:14:39.221
Rack 'em up,
Break Shot!

00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:50.754
Whip Snake!

00:14:50.754 --> 00:14:52.154
Tough break for you.

00:14:52.154 --> 00:14:55.888
That trap just squashed 900
attack points out of your snake.

00:14:57.954 --> 00:15:00.588
Mm‐mm, mmm...
That's a newbie mistake.

00:15:00.588 --> 00:15:02.388
Whenever you pick up
an Action Card

00:15:02.388 --> 00:15:04.588
there's always
an element of risk.

00:15:04.588 --> 00:15:07.121
And you're not out of
trouble yet.

00:15:07.121 --> 00:15:08.588
What?
What do you mean?

00:15:08.588 --> 00:15:10.488
I'll give you one clue.

00:15:10.488 --> 00:15:12.521
That ball you're on
doesn't have any brakes,

00:15:12.521 --> 00:15:13.854
and you could use some
right now.

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:23.754
Get me down from here!

00:15:23.754 --> 00:15:25.288
Whoa!

00:15:27.588 --> 00:15:30.788
I've got you!

00:15:30.788 --> 00:15:32.354
Don't let me go!

00:15:32.354 --> 00:15:33.954
I don't think
I will bounce!

00:15:33.954 --> 00:15:35.021
Stay calm!

00:15:35.021 --> 00:15:36.288
I'll get you up!

00:15:36.288 --> 00:15:37.521
Hang on tight, Zuzu!

00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:39.554
You're gonna be okay!

00:15:39.554 --> 00:15:41.254
They need help!

00:15:41.254 --> 00:15:42.454
I know.

00:15:42.454 --> 00:15:45.788
But you've got your own
problems, namely...

00:15:45.788 --> 00:15:48.688
my Lightning Hoverboard!

00:15:48.688 --> 00:15:50.888
It's gonna light up
your snake.

00:15:50.888 --> 00:15:52.221
Shock it to him!

00:15:52.221 --> 00:15:54.521
Can't outrun them.

00:15:54.521 --> 00:15:57.421
Great!
An Action Card!

00:15:57.421 --> 00:15:59.254
Oh no, not again.

00:15:59.254 --> 00:16:00.554
Nice work.

00:16:00.554 --> 00:16:05.454
You found another treacherous
trap‐‐ Jump Shot!

00:16:05.454 --> 00:16:07.354
Hey, Whip Snake, catch!

00:16:12.121 --> 00:16:14.121
Better luck next duel.

00:16:14.121 --> 00:16:15.354
Come on.

00:16:15.354 --> 00:16:17.254
You'd better get
on "the ball," Yuya,

00:16:17.254 --> 00:16:19.888
before you find
yourself under it.

00:16:19.888 --> 00:16:20.988
Help!

00:16:48.338 --> 00:16:49.738
Help!

00:16:49.738 --> 00:16:53.638
I should take those whiners
down, but I won't‐‐ not yet.

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:57.105
That tower will stand till Yuya
teaches me to Pendulum Summon.

00:17:01.238 --> 00:17:04.171
Zuzu!
Are you guys okay?

00:17:07.771 --> 00:17:09.738
Just hang on tight,
Frederick!

00:17:09.738 --> 00:17:11.971
Don't worry,
I'm not letting go!

00:17:11.971 --> 00:17:14.171
But I don't think
it's of any use.

00:17:14.171 --> 00:17:15.638
Let's face it,
we're doomed!

00:17:15.638 --> 00:17:16.805
That's not true!

00:17:16.805 --> 00:17:18.905
Yuya will find a way
to rescue us.

00:17:18.905 --> 00:17:20.138
It'll be okay.

00:17:20.138 --> 00:17:21.205
Don't worry, guys.

00:17:21.205 --> 00:17:22.838
Yuya's not gonna
give up on us,

00:17:22.838 --> 00:17:24.705
and we can't
give up either.

00:17:24.705 --> 00:17:27.205
Just hang on
a little longer.

00:17:27.205 --> 00:17:28.605
I have to find a way
to help them.

00:17:28.605 --> 00:17:31.905
(Sylvio)
Then show me how to
Pendulum Summon.

00:17:31.905 --> 00:17:35.905
And if you do,
I may save your friends.

00:17:35.905 --> 00:17:38.071
I can save them!

00:17:38.071 --> 00:17:39.471
I'll never
get to them by foot,

00:17:39.471 --> 00:17:44.038
so it's time to H‐two‐go with
Performapal Skeeter Skimmer.

00:17:47.638 --> 00:17:50.505
I'll get there
as fast as I can, guys.

00:17:50.505 --> 00:17:53.305
I've toyed with this
twerp for long enough.

00:17:53.305 --> 00:17:56.805
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

00:17:56.805 --> 00:18:01.005
Since he won't cooperate,
I'll set him in my sights.

00:18:01.005 --> 00:18:02.871
You're sunk, Yuya.

00:18:06.371 --> 00:18:09.405
You have
drawn well, Sylvio.

00:18:09.405 --> 00:18:12.405
Ooh, must be
my lucky day.

00:18:12.405 --> 00:18:15.105
I don't need this Lightning
Hoverboard anymore.

00:18:15.105 --> 00:18:17.371
I'll tribute it
so that I can activate

00:18:17.371 --> 00:18:19.738
the spell Tribute Trade.

00:18:19.738 --> 00:18:21.105
I can add a monster
to my hand

00:18:21.105 --> 00:18:22.738
as long as it's
one level higher

00:18:22.738 --> 00:18:27.238
than the monster
I just tributed.

00:18:27.238 --> 00:18:31.371
Stargazer Magician, I hope
you're ready to work some magic.

00:18:31.371 --> 00:18:33.938
He's using my
Pendulum card?

00:18:33.938 --> 00:18:36.605
I see that finally
got your attention.

00:18:36.605 --> 00:18:38.438
You know what's coming
next, of course.

00:18:38.438 --> 00:18:41.771
You need two cards to pull off
a Pendulum Summon, Sylvio.

00:18:41.771 --> 00:18:43.271
(chuckling)

00:18:43.271 --> 00:18:45.171
You make an
excellent point.

00:18:45.171 --> 00:18:48.071
Guess it's a good thing
I planned ahead.

00:18:48.071 --> 00:18:49.505
You don't mean‐‐

00:18:49.505 --> 00:18:52.038
Yes!
I can access both cards.

00:18:52.038 --> 00:18:56.938
I drew Stargazer and Timegazer
Magician is already in my hand.

00:18:56.938 --> 00:19:00.238
It's been there from the start
of the duel, in fact!

00:19:00.238 --> 00:19:03.238
You refused to show me how to
Pendulum Summon, but so what?

00:19:03.238 --> 00:19:06.471
If someone as lame as you can
do it, anyone can pull it off.

00:19:06.471 --> 00:19:09.938
(laughing)

00:19:09.938 --> 00:19:11.971
And I bet I'll do it
so much better.

00:19:15.505 --> 00:19:19.871
The first step is to
set the Pendulum Cards.

00:19:19.871 --> 00:19:22.371
Do exactly
as you're told.

00:19:22.371 --> 00:19:25.771
You will start with Scale One
Stargazer Magician.

00:19:25.771 --> 00:19:26.905
If you insist.

00:19:26.905 --> 00:19:28.038
For my first move,

00:19:28.038 --> 00:19:30.671
I select Scale One
Stargazer Magician.

00:19:30.671 --> 00:19:31.605
Can he do it?

00:19:31.605 --> 00:19:33.638
I thought I was
the only one.

00:19:33.638 --> 00:19:36.638
You will also use your Scale
Eight Timegazer Magician.

00:19:36.638 --> 00:19:39.571
And my Scale Eight
Timegazer Magician.

00:19:39.571 --> 00:19:41.338
(both)
And next, I'll set
the Pendulum Scale.

00:19:55.505 --> 00:19:58.638
(both)
Pendulum Summon!

00:19:58.638 --> 00:20:00.805
(Sylvio)
Monsters, emerge!

00:20:00.805 --> 00:20:04.771
Allow me to introduce
Power Dart Striker,

00:20:04.771 --> 00:20:08.438
along with its colleague,
Rocket Dart Striker,

00:20:08.438 --> 00:20:11.505
and the most powerful of my
trio, Ultimate Dart Striker!

00:20:17.771 --> 00:20:19.038
Incredible!

00:20:19.038 --> 00:20:22.805
I actually did it,
on my first try.

00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:24.738
Oh, thank you
for the cards, Yuya.

00:20:24.738 --> 00:20:28.338
Now I truly am
a Pendulum Master.

00:20:28.338 --> 00:20:30.105
No way.

00:20:30.105 --> 00:20:32.471
It worked.

00:20:32.471 --> 00:20:33.505
He's done it.

00:20:37.038 --> 00:20:40.438
Well done, Sylvio.

00:20:40.438 --> 00:20:42.771
Now, take aim
and strike Yuya down.

00:23:29.838 --> 00:23:32.838
