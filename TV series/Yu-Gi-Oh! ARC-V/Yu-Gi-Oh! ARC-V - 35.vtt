(announcer)
<i>Shay's aerial onslaught</i>

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.666
has wiped all of Sora's
monsters off his field!

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:12.333
Can Sora do anything
to get back into this game?

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:15.533
Now you know what it's like
to be helpless like we were.

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.233
Helpless as you
and your fusion friends

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:21.233
launched a surprise
attack on our home.

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:23.000
You were no match for us
when we attacked you

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.733
and you're no match
for me now!

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.166
I Fusion Summon!

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.500
Come on out, my mighty mash‐up,
Frightfur Chimera!

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.033
Attack Blaze Falcon!

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:45.566
Go Rank Up
Xyz Evolution!

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:49.766
Emerge,
Raidraptor Revolution Falcon!

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.366
Watch him closely,
Riley.

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.366
He might be the key to
helping us save our world.

00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.300
Huh?

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.000
Go
Revolution Falcon!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.666
Torch the
enemy!

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.933
We have a winner!

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.100
This duel goes
to Shay!

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.766
I can't lose...

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.800
Not to
an Xyz Summoner!

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.000
I want a
rematch!

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.166
Don't go!

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.366

(moaning softly)

Poor Sora.

00:02:36.733 --> 00:02:38.133
He's gonna
be okay.

00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:39.566
If you're going
to need fixing,

00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:41.500
this is the place
you want to be.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.733
I know‐‐
It was so scary.

00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:45.066
After all,

00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:47.100
it's not every day someone gets
injured in a duel for real.

00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:53.733
And it's all
Shay's fault.

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:58.333
Sir, Sora Perse is
currently being treated

00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:00.400
at the Leo Institute
medical facility.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.800
The injuries that he sustained
were significant,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.433
but he
should recover.

00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:06.533
That's good.

00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:08.500
Because I need
little Sora well.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.566
I have so many questions
about Duel Academy

00:03:10.566 --> 00:03:13.266
that I need
answered.

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:14.266
When he mends,

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:16.133
I want you
to bring him here.

00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:17.700
Yes.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.133
And bring me his Duel Disk,
as well.

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.133
Now
leave me.

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:22.133
Yes, sir.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.000
(Skip) Yoko and I ought
to get the younger kids home.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.866
We'll catch up
with you later.

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:34.166
So what's
your take?

00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:36.000
Huh?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.633
On Shay taking down
the Leo Institute

00:03:37.633 --> 00:03:39.366
and then dueling
for them?

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:42.700
It's like he did a total 180
and nobody batted an eye.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.300
So weird.
I know.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.266
I wish I knew
what was going on.

00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:48.300
First, Julia hunts Shay down
to take him out,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.966
and then,
she's cool with him.

00:03:49.966 --> 00:03:51.966
Those two being teammates
doesn't add up at all.

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:53.100
That's crazy.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.933
And Gong don't
like crazy.

00:03:54.933 --> 00:03:56.800
Yeah, and that's not
even the half of it.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.700
Shay's friend Yuto told me
something even crazier.

00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:02.533
We have enemies,
Zuzu.

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:04.733
And a friend of ours
was taken by them.

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:07.666
My colleague and I will stop
at nothing to get her back.

00:04:07.666 --> 00:04:09.500
How does attacking
a duel school

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.933
have anything to do
with getting a friend back?

00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:14.966
(Zuzu) I don't know,
but he was dead serious.

00:04:16.566 --> 00:04:18.533
This is like
a giant jigsaw puzzle,

00:04:18.533 --> 00:04:20.200
but we're missin'
pieces!

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.466
And Gong don't like
missin' pieces.

00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:25.366
When Gong gets stuck,
Gong likes to take a step back.

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:26.533
So what are the facts?

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.000
For one, this Yuto guy
looks like me.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.166
And whenever I show up, your
bracelet glows and he vanishes.

00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:40.733
Say what?
Oh!

00:04:40.733 --> 00:04:42.900
It's true‐‐
For whatever reason,

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.933
whenever this thing turns on,
he always takes off.

00:04:44.933 --> 00:04:46.400
And Yuya's right.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.966
He and Yuto have a resemblance
that's absolutely uncanny!

00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:53.800
So Yuya's got a twin
look‐alike that can do magic
tricks?

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.133
What else is there?

00:04:57.133 --> 00:04:59.600
What else do we know that can
fill the missing pieces?

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.466
Well,
maybe it's nothing

00:05:01.466 --> 00:05:04.233
but Yuto did say
something else to me.

00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:05.700
Nothing
could be something!

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.533
So go on and tell us
what he said.

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:28.700
Yuto said Fusion's
the way of their enemy?

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.766
That's right.

00:05:30.766 --> 00:05:33.000
Then that must be
why Shay went bonkers

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.700
in his duel
against Sora.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.266
I bet he's thinking
Sora's the enemy

00:05:37.266 --> 00:05:39.733
because he uses
Fusion cards.

00:05:39.733 --> 00:05:43.033
You don't think Sora's
a bad guy, do ya?

00:05:43.033 --> 00:05:44.966
Well, in that duel
with Shay,

00:05:44.966 --> 00:05:47.733
we saw a side of our friend
we've never seen before.

00:05:47.733 --> 00:05:50.233
So if Sora is mixed up
in all this,

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:52.900
then he must have some kind
of connection to Shay and Yuto

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.366
that we don't
know about.

00:05:54.366 --> 00:05:55.500
Huh?

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.933
Poor Shay!

00:05:56.933 --> 00:05:59.033
Still thinking
you have a chance.

00:05:59.033 --> 00:06:02.133
Well, here's
a reality check!

00:06:02.133 --> 00:06:03.566
You're going
to lose.

00:06:03.566 --> 00:06:05.700
It's the one thing
you're good at.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.266
Isn't that right,
Shay?

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:08.966
You were no match for us
when we attacked you,

00:06:08.966 --> 00:06:11.700
and you're no match
for me now!

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.433
There's definitely some
history between those two.

00:06:14.433 --> 00:06:17.466
But Zuzu, if you know
anything else, anything,

00:06:17.466 --> 00:06:19.633
now's the time.
Uh...

00:06:30.033 --> 00:06:31.566
Yuya?

00:06:33.033 --> 00:06:34.766
Tell me, Sora.

00:06:34.766 --> 00:06:35.800
You!

00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:40.333
Tell me
where Lulu is.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.966
(Gong) So let Gong
get this straight.

00:06:44.966 --> 00:06:47.433
Shay's sister is one of the
friends they're trying to
save?

00:06:47.433 --> 00:06:48.966
That's what Yuto
told me.

00:06:48.966 --> 00:06:53.066
Then that means they must think
Sora knows where she is.

00:06:53.066 --> 00:06:55.700
That certainly explains
why they targeted him.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.933
And if it's true, they won't
let up until she's safe.

00:06:58.933 --> 00:07:01.000
I don't know a Lulu!

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.900
So just beat it,
would ya?

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.033
No, I'm not going anywhere
without answers.

00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:06.333
Answers, huh?

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:07.966
Fine,
how's this?

00:07:07.966 --> 00:07:09.700
If she's one of
your Xyz buddies,

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.166
you'll never
see her again.

00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:12.366
And why is that?

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:15.366
Because there would be
no way to get her back!

00:07:15.366 --> 00:07:17.333
It doesn't work
that way with us!

00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:18.666
Oh!

00:07:18.666 --> 00:07:20.900
Now tell me
where he is!

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.333
Who do you mean?

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:23.666
Shay Obsidian!

00:07:23.666 --> 00:07:26.033
After all, I have a score
to settle with him!

00:07:26.033 --> 00:07:28.100
Now,
give him up!

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.833
There's no score left
to be settled.

00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:31.566
He already beat you.

00:07:31.566 --> 00:07:32.633
That was luck!

00:07:32.633 --> 00:07:34.766
No Xyz Summoner
could truly beat me!

00:07:34.766 --> 00:07:36.066
So...

00:07:36.066 --> 00:07:38.266
Tell me where he is right now
and we'll duel again!

00:07:38.266 --> 00:07:39.566
I'll prove
that I'm better!

00:07:39.566 --> 00:07:40.866
Just you wait.

00:07:40.866 --> 00:07:42.833
I'll prove it
to everyone!

00:07:42.833 --> 00:07:44.566
(man)
What's going on in there?

00:07:44.566 --> 00:07:47.200
Visiting hours
are over!

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.166
How'd you
get in here?

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.800
Wait up!

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.166
Now just calm down...

00:07:54.166 --> 00:07:55.166
No!

00:07:55.166 --> 00:07:57.333
(punches landing,
grunting)

00:07:59.366 --> 00:08:00.933
(guard) Hurry up!
We've gotta find him!

00:08:00.933 --> 00:08:02.166
He must be here
somewhere!

00:08:02.166 --> 00:08:03.933
Yeah, but where?
We've looked all over!

00:08:03.933 --> 00:08:05.466
Wonder what's
going on?

00:08:05.466 --> 00:08:07.833
He must have made
his way outside, sir!

00:08:07.833 --> 00:08:09.766
Let's split up
and check the grounds.

00:08:09.766 --> 00:08:12.966
I'll contact headquarters
and request back‐up.

00:08:12.966 --> 00:08:15.000
Sir, I've dispatched
all of our units.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.066
They're canvassing
the entire city.

00:08:17.066 --> 00:08:18.966
We'll find
Sora Perse.

00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:19.933
No,
Claude.

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:21.733
We're in the middle
of a tournament.

00:08:21.733 --> 00:08:23.566
Call back
all our people.

00:08:23.566 --> 00:08:25.233
But sir,
if we lose Sora‐‐

00:08:25.233 --> 00:08:27.900
We won't‐‐ we'll use
our security cameras.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.366
He won't be able
to hide from those.

00:08:30.366 --> 00:08:33.133
Meet me
in the control room.

00:08:34.933 --> 00:08:36.800
(Zuzu)
My dad said he'd
be here soon.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.866
(Gong)
Sora's still hurt.

00:08:37.866 --> 00:08:39.266
We gotta find
him quick.

00:08:39.266 --> 00:08:40.833
Probably best for us
to split up.

00:08:40.833 --> 00:08:42.633
Gong will head
to the docks.

00:08:42.633 --> 00:08:44.133
(Yuya)
I'll check
the east side of town!

00:08:44.133 --> 00:08:46.133
I'll check out
the west!

00:09:00.966 --> 00:09:01.966
Location?

00:09:01.966 --> 00:09:03.666
The City Park.

00:09:03.666 --> 00:09:06.133
Send our people there
immediately.

00:09:06.133 --> 00:09:07.866
Hold on!

00:09:16.233 --> 00:09:19.566
Now move the camera in the
direction that Sora is looking.

00:09:23.966 --> 00:09:25.033
Who's that?

00:09:25.033 --> 00:09:27.033
Enough
of these games!

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:28.400
Where is Shay?

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.400
Is that...

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.600
Yuya?

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.733
It is!

00:09:38.733 --> 00:09:39.933
(Shay)
No.

00:09:41.333 --> 00:09:43.533
He's known as Yuto.

00:09:43.533 --> 00:09:46.433
Who's Yuto?

00:09:46.433 --> 00:09:49.500
The one who
will save us all.

00:09:52.633 --> 00:09:55.433
♪

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.766
It's funny...

00:09:57.766 --> 00:10:00.566
I had my suspicions there
were two duelists out there,

00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:02.933
targeting
Leo Institute students.

00:10:02.933 --> 00:10:06.500
So it's you
and this Yuto fellow.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.100
I still can't
get over it.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.633
Yuto looks almost
identical to Yuya.

00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:20.166
(breathing heavily)
For the last time...

00:10:20.166 --> 00:10:21.533
bring me Shay!

00:10:21.533 --> 00:10:23.333
What would be
the point?

00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:25.100
We both know that you're
no match for him.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.133
Wrong!

00:10:26.133 --> 00:10:28.200
It's him who'd be
no match for me!

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.333
He could never beat
metwice in a row!

00:10:30.333 --> 00:10:33.766
See, we're the ones who
hunt down you Xyz Summoners,

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:35.333
not the other
way around!

00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:37.166
That's right!
You and Shay...

00:10:37.166 --> 00:10:39.333
And this Lulu person
you're looking for...

00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:44.333
You're nothing more than an
annoying speck to my people.

00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:46.366
And if you don't
believe me,

00:10:46.366 --> 00:10:49.066
I'll be happy to prove it
right here and now...

00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:50.466
By beating you!

00:10:50.466 --> 00:10:52.900
That's what you get
for not giving up Shay.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.433
And I'd accept
if I were you,

00:10:54.433 --> 00:10:57.500
'cause even though I'm foggy
about this friend Lulu of yours,

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.166
if my people
do have her...

00:10:59.166 --> 00:11:00.300
Well, guess what?

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.366
There'd be
only one way

00:11:01.366 --> 00:11:03.733
for you to ever get her back
safe and sound!

00:11:03.733 --> 00:11:04.966
Tell me!

00:11:04.966 --> 00:11:06.800
Finally, we're
getting somewhere!

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:12.000
By taking us down one
by one, starting with me.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.866
<i>But let's be real.</i>

00:11:13.866 --> 00:11:16.966
The only one that's
gonna be taken down is you!

00:11:18.233 --> 00:11:19.400
No, don't go!

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.466
Why?

00:11:20.466 --> 00:11:22.066
Because...

00:11:22.066 --> 00:11:25.466
We have a deal and I need you
focused on the tournament.

00:11:25.466 --> 00:11:28.900
Your personal problems
must come second.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.800
You have to think
about the bigger picture.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.466
Remember, Shay.

00:11:34.466 --> 00:11:37.300
This tournament will help me
find duelists skilled enough

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.333
to face my father,
Leo Akaba.

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:41.200
So, please.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.400
Leave this duel
to Yuto.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.866
So you really don't want
to bring me Shay?

00:11:54.866 --> 00:11:56.433
Well, fine then.

00:11:56.433 --> 00:11:59.700
I could totally use a little
warming up before I crush him!

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.266
I'll beat you,
then after I do,

00:12:02.266 --> 00:12:05.033
I'll take down Shay and every
other Xyz Summoner around!

00:12:05.033 --> 00:12:06.700
Not happening.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.233
I'm going
to rescue Lulu...

00:12:08.233 --> 00:12:10.133
And it starts
right here!

00:12:10.133 --> 00:12:11.566
Let's Duel!

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.033
I'll draw first!

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:15.666
So
here goes!

00:12:15.666 --> 00:12:19.300
I summon the sharply tipped
Edge Imp Tomahawk!

00:12:22.766 --> 00:12:25.900
Now those blades will beeline
it to your life points!

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.500
'Cause by sending one
Edge Imp monster in my hand

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.500
to the
graveyard,

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.733
your life points
are cut down by 800!

00:12:35.733 --> 00:12:36.900
Huh!

00:12:38.933 --> 00:12:41.766
Ha‐‐ And there's a lot more
where that came from!

00:12:41.766 --> 00:12:43.500
But that'll do
for now.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.000
Looks like Sora is off
to a strong start.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.866
Not strong
enough.

00:12:47.866 --> 00:12:49.000
With all
that's at stake,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.466
there's no way Yuto
will lose this duel.

00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:54.833
Huh?!

00:12:54.833 --> 00:12:57.600
Watch this closely.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.500
(groaning)

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.266
Regretting this?

00:13:03.266 --> 00:13:05.600
If you want out,
just call up Shay,

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.766
and I'll let him take your
place for the rest of the duel!

00:13:08.766 --> 00:13:11.200
No chance‐‐
I draw!

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.433
I summon The Phantom Knights
of Ancient Cloak!

00:13:16.766 --> 00:13:17.833
Ha!

00:13:17.833 --> 00:13:19.800
The best you can do
is summon a monster

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.766
with only 800
attack points?

00:13:21.766 --> 00:13:24.766
But then again, I don't
know why I'm so surprised.

00:13:24.766 --> 00:13:27.766
I shouldn't expect more
from an Xyz Summoner.

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:29.533
Prepare for
the unexpected then.

00:13:29.533 --> 00:13:31.633
You see, my Knights
don't fight alone.

00:13:31.633 --> 00:13:33.666
When a Level 3 Phantom Knight
is on my field

00:13:33.666 --> 00:13:37.333
I can summon The Phantom
Knights Of Silent Boots!

00:13:41.233 --> 00:13:42.233
Okay,
I get it.

00:13:42.233 --> 00:13:44.100
You got two monsters
with the same Level.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.466
So you're gonna
Xyz Summon.

00:13:47.833 --> 00:13:50.700
I overlay Level 3 The Phantom
Knights of Ancient Cloak

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.433
and The Phantom Knights
of Silent Boots!

00:13:55.366 --> 00:13:58.333
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:01.433
and Xyz Summon The Phantom
Knights of Break Sword!

00:14:04.866 --> 00:14:07.400
Rise,
my mighty beast!

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.000
(horse neighs)

00:14:16.133 --> 00:14:17.300
Awesome!

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.266
I can't wait 'til
I get to destroy it!

00:14:19.266 --> 00:14:22.100
Sorry to disappoint, but
that's not going to happen.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.066
Now Break Sword!

00:14:23.066 --> 00:14:25.300
Cut down
Edge Imp Tomahawk!

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.600
(horse neighs)

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.333
I now place two cards
facedown and end my turn.

00:14:35.133 --> 00:14:36.333
(chuckles)
Aw...

00:14:36.333 --> 00:14:38.766
After all of that buildup,
that's all you could do?

00:14:38.766 --> 00:14:40.233
Pretty lame
if you ask me!

00:14:40.233 --> 00:14:41.600
Zuzu, come in!

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.266
I've looked all over for
Sora, but so far nothing!

00:14:45.266 --> 00:14:46.966
Yeah, I haven't had
any luck either.

00:14:46.966 --> 00:14:47.966
What gives?

00:14:47.966 --> 00:14:49.633
Where could Sora
have gone to?

00:14:49.633 --> 00:14:52.833
I dunno but we can't stop
looking 'til we find him!

00:14:54.366 --> 00:14:55.733
So...

00:14:55.733 --> 00:14:57.666
You busted out
an Xyz Summon.

00:14:57.666 --> 00:14:59.333
Well, I guess it's time
for me to show you

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:01.400
what
real summoning's like!

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.866
Here goes!

00:15:03.866 --> 00:15:08.833
I'm activating this sweet
spell card Polymerization!

00:15:08.833 --> 00:15:12.000
With it, I'll fuse
my Fluffal Bear...

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.033
with
Edge Imp Sabers !

00:15:14.033 --> 00:15:17.233
Edge of sharpness
and fury of bear!

00:15:17.233 --> 00:15:22.333
When the two come together,
you had better beware!

00:15:22.333 --> 00:15:24.900
I Fusion Summon!

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.466
Here it
comes!

00:15:26.466 --> 00:15:29.600
It's the most unbearable
monster you've ever seen.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.266
It truly is a cut
above the rest!

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.033
Frightfur Bear!

00:15:45.033 --> 00:15:46.100
Sora?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.366
Ah!
What in the world?

00:15:50.466 --> 00:15:53.166
He looks
just like me!

00:15:57.433 --> 00:16:00.200
(Yuya) It's gotta be
that guy Yuto.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.500
Weird.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.566
Frightfur Bear!

00:16:03.566 --> 00:16:05.533
Get set
to do some pounding!

00:16:05.533 --> 00:16:06.666
Now,
attack!

00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:09.300
Take out Break Sword
with Pummeling Paw!

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.166
Thank you
for that!

00:16:14.166 --> 00:16:15.900
It was exactly
what I needed!

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.566
Because now Break Sword's
special ability activates,

00:16:18.566 --> 00:16:20.100
letting me bring back
the monsters

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.400
that I used
to summon it

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.066
but they're now
Level 4!

00:16:26.333 --> 00:16:28.033
Do you get it now,
Sora?

00:16:28.033 --> 00:16:30.300
Strike down my monsters
and they will rise!

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.400
Just like the Resistance
will rise over you

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.900
and your
Fusion punks!

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.100
Man, Zuzu
was right!

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.966
He really doesn't like
Fusion summoners.

00:16:38.966 --> 00:16:42.000
Now thanks to Frightfur
bear's special ability,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.700
it can devour the monster
it just destroyed!

00:16:51.933 --> 00:16:53.366
(burping loudly)

00:16:53.366 --> 00:16:56.566
And then that monster's attack
points are immediately added

00:16:56.566 --> 00:16:58.800
onto Frightfur Bear's!

00:17:00.733 --> 00:17:02.100
Guess
you were wrong,

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.700
because it looks to me like the
only thing rising around here

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.666
is my Frightfur Bear's
power!

00:17:06.666 --> 00:17:09.233
So go ahead,
Xyz Summon again!

00:17:09.233 --> 00:17:11.066
Frightfur Bear will just
chomp your monster up

00:17:11.066 --> 00:17:12.933
and gain
its attack points anyway.

00:17:12.933 --> 00:17:14.800
I can't wait to see
what you're planning

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.633
so hurry up
and show me!

00:17:17.866 --> 00:17:19.600
Okay,
then I draw!

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.933
First things first.

00:17:20.933 --> 00:17:22.233
I overlay Level 4

00:17:22.233 --> 00:17:25.666
The Phantom Knights of
Ancient Cloak and Silent Boots!

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.833
Ha‐‐ You're really
gonna do it again?

00:17:31.833 --> 00:17:34.600
Cloaked in shadows and
relentless in its objective,

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.000
I call upon the most
dangerous of Dragons!

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.900
I Xyz Summon!

00:17:42.766 --> 00:17:43.866
Uh!

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.133
Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon!

00:17:50.666 --> 00:17:52.833
An Xyz Dragon?!

00:17:52.833 --> 00:17:54.700
This just
got real!

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.500
Say, what's the point of
you bringing out a monster

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.800
that's totally weaker
than my Frightfur Bear?

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.200
My monster's
so strong,

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.666
it'll pummel your Dragon
into smithereens.

00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:07.000
Dark Rebellion Dragon's
ability is the point.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.500
By using
one Overlay Unit,

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.133
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon's
special ability activates!

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:13.800
Now until the end
of this turn,

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.666
the attack points of your
Frightfur Bear are cut in half!

00:18:16.666 --> 00:18:20.333
Then Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon
gains those attack points.

00:18:22.066 --> 00:18:24.933
Uh‐oh, if he goes and uses
its last Overlay Unit,

00:18:24.933 --> 00:18:26.366
his Dragon
will steal half

00:18:26.366 --> 00:18:29.233
of Frightfur Bear's attack
points again.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:30.700
Yuto has this
in the bag!

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.666
All he has to do is use that
Overlay Unit and Sora will lose!

00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:35.233
Now I attack!

00:18:35.233 --> 00:18:36.500
What?!

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.333
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon,
take down Frightfur Bear!

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.066
Mauling
Mandible Charge!

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.966
(Sora wails)

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:57.000
This is just like when Shay
battled those Leo students.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.366
That attack was real!

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:01.833
(gasps)

00:19:02.766 --> 00:19:04.700
With that,
I end my turn.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:09.933
And Dark Rebellion Xyz
Dragon's attack points return
to normal.

00:19:11.433 --> 00:19:13.733
Sora!

00:19:13.733 --> 00:19:14.766
What's this?

00:19:16.566 --> 00:19:19.400
Yuya Sakaki.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.566
Are you okay,
Sora?

00:19:21.566 --> 00:19:22.566
Go away!

00:19:22.566 --> 00:19:24.100
This doesn't
concern you, Yuya!

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.800
It does now!

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.966
You shouldn't be dueling
in your condition, Sora.

00:19:27.966 --> 00:19:31.133
You should be resting back
at the hospital!

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.733
That punk...

00:19:37.733 --> 00:19:39.900
He could have beat me,
but he didn't.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.033
But now...
He'll regret it!

00:19:44.233 --> 00:19:45.633
Gotta show him...

00:19:45.633 --> 00:19:47.233
That I'm better
than him!

00:19:47.233 --> 00:19:49.166
No way, Sora!
You're done!

00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:50.633
I'm not letting you
go on like this!

00:19:50.633 --> 00:19:51.733
Back off!

00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:53.633
I'm staying right here
until I beat him!

00:19:53.633 --> 00:19:56.433
I'm sorry, Yuya, but you
can't possibly understand

00:19:56.433 --> 00:19:58.066
that I have something
to prove!

00:19:58.066 --> 00:19:59.166
Look,
Sora‐‐

00:19:59.166 --> 00:20:00.633
Just prove it
later.

00:20:00.633 --> 00:20:02.000
There'll be
a next time.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.266
No,
there won't be.

00:20:03.266 --> 00:20:06.100
In a battle like this,
there is no next time!

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.833
Sora is right.

00:20:07.833 --> 00:20:10.433
But
I am merciful.

00:20:10.433 --> 00:20:12.200
I do not wish
to fight.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.500
So if Sora
surrenders,

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.333
this can be settled without
any further suffering.

00:20:17.333 --> 00:20:18.766
Now lay down
your Duel Disk

00:20:18.766 --> 00:20:20.733
and tell me
what I want to know

00:20:20.733 --> 00:20:22.400
or I'll be forced
to make sure

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.600
this is the last duel
you ever have.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.833
What does that mean?

00:20:26.833 --> 00:20:29.266
What do you mean this'll be
the last duel he ever has?

00:20:31.333 --> 00:20:32.366
Listen up.

00:20:32.366 --> 00:20:34.333
You and Shay have been
going after Sora

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:35.966
and it's gotta stop
here and now!

00:20:39.366 --> 00:20:41.666
We didn't start
this fight‐‐ They did!

00:20:41.666 --> 00:20:42.900
None of this
would have happened

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.466
if they didn't attack us
and take Lulu.

00:20:45.466 --> 00:20:47.066
Lulu?

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:51.133
Now,
if you're smart,

00:20:51.133 --> 00:20:53.066
you will leave and
let us finish this.

00:20:53.066 --> 00:20:56.366
After all, this is
not your battle.

00:20:56.366 --> 00:20:59.966
And believe me, you don't
want to become a part of it.

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:09.433
I won't leave!

00:21:09.433 --> 00:21:10.800
And I won't let you
hurt my friend

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.900
any more than
you already have!

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.866
Which is why I'm joining
this duel!

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:10.433
