00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:04.433
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V."

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:07.733
Three years ago, the famous
Duel‐tainer, Yusho Sakaki,

00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.366
failed to defend his title
against The Sledgehammer.

00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:14.266
Now Sakaki's own son will try to
erase that disgrace.

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:19.133
Time to activate the field
Castle of Chaos!

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:22.366
(computer) Augmented Reality
Combat system energized.

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.600
The field it's generating
is so real,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.466
you can actually climb
the castle walls

00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.800
or toss your mother‐in‐law
in the dungeon.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.700
Are you ready?

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.966
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.433
Odd‐Eyes, get set to strike!

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:36.533
Take out Battleguard King.

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.600
Spiral Flame!

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.300
Yeah! Bull's‐eye!
Yeah!

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.900
Battleguard King,
destroy his Odd‐Eyes.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.900
Oh!

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.466
(roaring)

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.500
Maybe you should pull a
disappearing act, kid.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.066
After all, like father,
like son!

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:58.000
Okay, pendulum,
you swung his way.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.300
Now you'll swing my way!

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.800
I'll use Stargazer Magician
and Timegazer Magician

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.433
to set the Pendulum Scale

00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:15.533
My monsters are ready to swing
into action!

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.400

00:02:21.366 --> 00:02:23.533
Sir, I picked up an unusual
summoning signal

00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:24.833
from the city's coastal zone.

00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:26.200
The reading
is off the charts.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.600
Analysis, quick!

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.266
I have the results, sir.

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:30.866
If the wave patterns
are correct,

00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:33.233
then someone is using
pendulum energy.

00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:36.200
Pendulum energy?

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.666
(roaring)

00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:47.400
The kid summoned
three monsters at once.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.366
I should be the one flexing
my dueling muscles

00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:50.933
in front of this crowd.

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:52.900
I can't believe
a puny boy like him

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.800
can pull such
a powerful maneuver.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.033
It must be a trick.

00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:58.933
I'm stunned, too, but if
his move wasn't legit,

00:02:58.933 --> 00:03:00.633
the judges would have
intervened.

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:03.733
Where did he learn this
Pendulum Summoning?

00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:08.266
Whip Snake, it's time for you
to whip into action.

00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:10.400
By activating
its special ability,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.300
it can switch the attack
and defense points

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.166
of your Battleguard King.

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:20.200
That Snake weakened
my only monster!

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.400
Oh, yeah!

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.066
And now my Sword Fish will
wear him down some more.

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:28.533
Using its special ability,
my Performapal

00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:32.300
can slice and dice your
King's attack points by 600.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.666
(announcer on P. A.)
Whoa! Things are looking bad
for the champ.

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:37.533
This kid won't stop hammering
the Hammer!

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:39.066
Now for the big finish.

00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:41.066
Get set, Odd‐Eyes.

00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:43.166
Time to power up and attack.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.600
Your attack is about
to be extinguished.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.400
I play the trap
Battleguard Howling.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.500
Now your Odd‐Eyes must
retreat to your hand.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.933
But before it disappears,

00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:01.433
you will take all its attack
points as damage!

00:04:01.433 --> 00:04:03.333
Timegazer Magician,

00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:06.066
you've mastered the deepest
secrets of space and time.

00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:09.000
Use your powers to help
protect me from the past.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.466
Check this, everybody.

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:14.633
Timegazer Magician's Pendulum
ability can rewrite history.

00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:17.133
So, Sledgehammer, your trap
has been trumped.

00:04:17.133 --> 00:04:18.766
Infinity Gear Reverse!

00:04:20.366 --> 00:04:22.200
I better move it or lose it.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.066
Aah!

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.633
I'm activating
an Action Spell card.

00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:31.933
We've reached the grand finale,
Stargazer Magician.

00:04:31.933 --> 00:04:35.333
Let's end this duel with a trick
fans here will never forget.

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:39.400
Watch in wonder as Stargazer
uses his Pendulum ability.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.433
When there's a Pendulum
monster battling,

00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:45.366
Stargazer can stop
spell cards from activating.

00:04:45.366 --> 00:04:47.566
Halting Horoscope!

00:04:48.833 --> 00:04:51.100
(buzzer)

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.000
That move leaves me wide open!

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.933
Everything is set now,
Odd‐Eyes.

00:04:55.933 --> 00:04:59.400
Let's give The Sledgehammer
a blazing send‐off.

00:05:02.466 --> 00:05:04.800
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:05:09.566 --> 00:05:10.800
Nice try,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.133
but that attack couldn't even
toast a marshmallow.

00:05:13.133 --> 00:05:15.966
Then I guess I'll have to
turn up the heat.

00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:19.433
Since Battleguard King is a
Level‐five‐or‐above monster,

00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:23.100
Odd‐Eyes' special ability
deals double the damage.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.466
That's a wrap!

00:05:25.466 --> 00:05:27.600
Aah!

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:34.800
Aah!

00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:43.700
Odd‐Eyes, that was perfect.
Good job.

00:05:56.233 --> 00:05:58.733
He won?

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.533
Uh‐huh.

00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:03.266
Oh, yeah! Yuya makin' it
look easy!

00:06:03.266 --> 00:06:05.766
You showed 'em how it's done!

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.200
Huh?

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.400
What's going on?

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.533
Huh?

00:06:14.533 --> 00:06:17.066
Hey, what happened
to The Sledgehammer?

00:06:17.066 --> 00:06:19.500
You defeated him!

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.833
Your dad would
be so proud.

00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:23.333
Good work, Yuya.

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:25.200
You dueled
like a champion.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.600
You were unbelievable!

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.233
Even Gong was impressed.

00:06:28.233 --> 00:06:31.433
He's our star pupil!

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:34.666
(cheering)

00:06:34.666 --> 00:06:36.700
Yuya's my main man!

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.833
For real!

00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:39.733
He made the Sledgehammer
look like a toy hammer.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:43.333
I want to know what
that Pendulum Summoning
was all about.

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:45.366
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:06:45.366 --> 00:06:46.900
(growling)

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.766
No one walks over
the Sledgehammer and
gets away with it!

00:06:49.766 --> 00:06:50.766
Uhh!

00:06:50.766 --> 00:06:53.766
Wow, just listen
to that ovation!

00:06:53.766 --> 00:06:55.400
Kudos to you, Yuya.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.700
You have to let us all in
on your secret.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.533
Give us the lowdown on that
amazing new summoning technique

00:07:00.533 --> 00:07:02.333
you unveiled in today's duel.

00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:05.866
Huh?
New summoning what?

00:07:17.033 --> 00:07:18.200
Good news, sir.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.166
We just I. D.'d
the kid in question.

00:07:20.166 --> 00:07:21.933
His name is Yuya Sakaki.

00:07:21.933 --> 00:07:23.233
14 years old.

00:07:23.233 --> 00:07:26.133
Seems to be your typical
middle school student.

00:07:26.133 --> 00:07:28.633
Sakaki duels in the
Junior ARC League.

00:07:28.633 --> 00:07:32.233
I have his win‐loss record.
Nothing special.

00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:36.433
His record is 50‐50
at best.

00:07:36.433 --> 00:07:37.866
Where does Yuya train?

00:07:37.866 --> 00:07:40.166
All his training was
through one institution.

00:07:40.166 --> 00:07:42.333
A place called
the Yusho Duel School.

00:07:42.333 --> 00:07:43.433
I've heard that name before.

00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:47.933
Yusho Sakaki!
That was his school.

00:07:47.933 --> 00:07:51.033
Precisely. This young hotshot
is Sakaki's son.

00:07:51.033 --> 00:07:53.866
Apparently he's trying
to follow in his
father's footsteps.

00:07:53.866 --> 00:07:56.833
Yusho Sakaki vanished
three years ago

00:07:56.833 --> 00:07:58.933
and now his son
is suddenly using

00:07:58.933 --> 00:08:01.233
a radical new method
of summoning?

00:08:01.233 --> 00:08:02.766
There's not much to say.

00:08:02.766 --> 00:08:05.400
There's more here
than meets the eye.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.133
Prepare a background report
on this kid.

00:08:07.133 --> 00:08:08.766
Leave nothing out.

00:08:08.766 --> 00:08:11.500
Any facts that may relate
to Pendulum Summoning,

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.266
no matter how small, should be
reported to me immediately.

00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:20.333
<i>Meine Gute!</i>

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.533
Look at all the new kids
applying to You Show.

00:08:22.533 --> 00:08:25.500
They must have our school
confused with another school.

00:08:27.666 --> 00:08:29.700
The Yusho Duel School
is highly selective,

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.833
but if you fill out this form,

00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:32.833
I can almost guarantee
you'll get in!

00:08:32.833 --> 00:08:34.666
(kids shouting)

00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:38.300
What's up, Zuzu!

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.166
Oh hi, Ally.
Hey there, Frederick.

00:08:40.166 --> 00:08:41.833
Did you guys come out
to help me?

00:08:41.833 --> 00:08:45.033
Principal Boyle asked for
volunteers in our class.

00:08:45.033 --> 00:08:47.966
Since we are the only two,
he "volunteered" us.

00:08:47.966 --> 00:08:49.566
Where is the principal?

00:08:49.566 --> 00:08:52.033
The new ARC system
just arrived.

00:08:52.033 --> 00:08:54.033
We got it free
thanks to Yuya's duel.

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.233
It's the latest model

00:08:55.233 --> 00:08:57.366
and my dad wanted
to unpack it personally.

00:08:57.366 --> 00:09:00.300
I think he wants to adopt the
machine into our family.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.633
Yuya saved our school.

00:09:01.633 --> 00:09:03.466
Now everyone wants
to study here.

00:09:03.466 --> 00:09:05.533
They're excited
to duel like Yuya.

00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:07.066
When he did that
pendulum thingy,

00:09:07.066 --> 00:09:10.100
I jumped out of my seat
and started dancing!

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.666
(boy)
You teach all
the students here

00:09:11.666 --> 00:09:13.633
how to Pendulum
Summon, right?

00:09:13.633 --> 00:09:15.566
Yes, it's part of
the curriculum,

00:09:15.566 --> 00:09:17.700
if you're enrolled
in the school.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.700
Now who's first in line?

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.900
(kids shouting)

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.533
One at a time, please.

00:09:23.533 --> 00:09:25.366
Line up and I'll
get to you.

00:09:25.366 --> 00:09:26.533
Oh, great.

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:28.633
I'm supposed to be in
today's demo duel,

00:09:28.633 --> 00:09:30.766
but at this rate,
there's no way I'll be ready.

00:09:30.766 --> 00:09:32.666
Problem solved, Zuzu.

00:09:32.666 --> 00:09:34.133
Gong doesn't
want you to worry,

00:09:34.133 --> 00:09:37.066
so Gong'll take over
for you in the duel.

00:09:37.066 --> 00:09:39.100
Oh, no you won't!

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.566
Zuzu's the best
duelist here,

00:09:40.566 --> 00:09:41.900
so she should be
in the spotlight.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.066
Who does he think he is?
He doesn't even go here.

00:09:45.066 --> 00:09:47.300
You're bad for business.
Step outside.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.933
But Gong wants to stay!

00:09:48.933 --> 00:09:50.533
We've got you covered here,
Zuzu.

00:09:50.533 --> 00:09:52.133
You better go get prepped
for your duel.

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.500
Thanks, guys.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.633
You're in charge.

00:09:55.633 --> 00:09:59.366
I've seen you
around here before.

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:01.100
You want to enroll?

00:10:03.533 --> 00:10:05.966
Here at the Yusho
Duel School

00:10:05.966 --> 00:10:09.100
we continue a proud
tradition of Action Dueling.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.966
Our training will
produce a duelist

00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:13.166
who mixes the zeal of a
competitor

00:10:13.166 --> 00:10:16.366
with the crowd‐pleasing
instincts of an entertainer!

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:18.133
The legacy of that
great dueling legend‐‐

00:10:18.133 --> 00:10:19.700
Who cares about
this stuff?

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.233
Yeah, I just wanna learn
how to Pendulum Summon.

00:10:22.233 --> 00:10:25.133
Friends and fans,
gather 'round!

00:10:25.133 --> 00:10:27.000
Over there!
It's him!

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
(girl)
It's Yuya.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.200
Welcome, one and all,
to the Yuya Spectacular!

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.933
What?

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:35.700
This isn't all about you!

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.233
I happen to be dueling
in this match, too!

00:10:38.233 --> 00:10:39.966
Who is that girl?

00:10:39.966 --> 00:10:42.400
I can't believe she
interrupted Yuya like that.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.733
Go away!
Go away!

00:10:43.733 --> 00:10:45.700
(kids shouting)

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.766
Uugghh!

00:10:46.766 --> 00:10:48.666
All right, then.

00:10:48.666 --> 00:10:51.833
You wanna treat me
like a villain?

00:10:51.833 --> 00:10:53.666
Then that's exactly
what I'll be!

00:10:53.666 --> 00:10:56.500
Yuya, I can see
being in the limelight

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.033
has already soured your ego.

00:10:58.033 --> 00:11:00.400
But soon you'll be singing
a different tune

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.133
after I own this duel.

00:11:02.133 --> 00:11:03.200
Uh...

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.500
You need to say
something back to me.

00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:08.533
Oh!

00:11:08.533 --> 00:11:10.300
Whoa!

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.733
You must be The Sledgehammer's
sidekick!

00:11:12.733 --> 00:11:15.733
The Sledgehammer's sidekick?

00:11:15.733 --> 00:11:18.166
I recognize you now,
Gavel Girl!

00:11:18.166 --> 00:11:21.100
I'll use my pendulum power
to whoop you, too!

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.800
Listen to them.
They're fired up.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.833
Quick, Gong, boot up
the ARC system so
they can start dueling.

00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:29.833
I can't believe a heavyweight
like Gong

00:11:29.833 --> 00:11:32.033
is taking orders from a
half‐pint.

00:11:32.033 --> 00:11:33.666
Aagghh!

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.366
We're going to duel on the
field spell Plain Plain!

00:11:38.366 --> 00:11:41.633
(computer) Augmented Reality
Combat system energized.

00:11:41.633 --> 00:11:43.566
Generating Action Field.

00:11:43.566 --> 00:11:45.900
This new Augmented Reality
Combat system

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.500
really is top of the line.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.100
Check out how realistic that
stream and those fish look.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.266
After this duel's done,

00:11:51.266 --> 00:11:54.100
I'm grabbing my trunks
and taking a dip!

00:12:01.333 --> 00:12:03.366
Hyah!

00:12:03.366 --> 00:12:06.633
Augmented Reality
Combat System is set!

00:12:06.633 --> 00:12:10.133
Duelists prepare for battle!

00:12:10.133 --> 00:12:12.433
Only one will
rule the duel...

00:12:12.433 --> 00:12:15.933
...in the ultimate fusion of
Monsters and mayhem!

00:12:15.933 --> 00:12:17.766
The action begins ...

00:12:17.766 --> 00:12:19.000
(snaps fingers)
...now!

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:12:22.643 --> 00:12:24.009
I'm up first.

00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:27.643
I'll start off by summoning
Performapal Hip Hippo.

00:12:30.443 --> 00:12:32.276
That Hippo's happening!

00:12:32.276 --> 00:12:34.276
Yeah, once Yuma gets him
hoofing away,

00:12:34.276 --> 00:12:36.409
the dude's a high‐speed
heavyweight.

00:12:36.409 --> 00:12:38.243
Let's go!

00:12:38.243 --> 00:12:40.076
You're not gonna get far.

00:12:40.076 --> 00:12:42.209
It's my turn!
Hyah!

00:12:42.209 --> 00:12:45.509
I summon Aria
the Melodious Diva.

00:12:46.976 --> 00:12:49.276
Aria, attack!

00:12:49.276 --> 00:12:52.943
Bring Yuya's Hippo
to a halt.

00:12:52.943 --> 00:12:54.409
(high‐pitched note)

00:12:54.409 --> 00:12:56.509
Piercing Note!

00:13:00.343 --> 00:13:02.309
An Action Spell.

00:13:02.309 --> 00:13:03.843
Perfect!

00:13:03.843 --> 00:13:06.309
Let's rock and roll.

00:13:06.309 --> 00:13:08.209
(cheering)

00:13:08.209 --> 00:13:10.209
You think you've escaped,

00:13:10.209 --> 00:13:12.943
but Aria can still belt out
some damage.

00:13:12.943 --> 00:13:16.009
Since her attack failed,
she can use her special ability

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:18.576
to reduce your life points
by 800.

00:13:18.576 --> 00:13:20.676
Resonating Wave!

00:13:22.243 --> 00:13:24.109
Aah!

00:13:27.176 --> 00:13:29.043
(sinister laugh)

00:13:29.043 --> 00:13:31.209
That will teach you not
to turn your back on me,

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:32.809
you wimpy wannabe!

00:13:32.809 --> 00:13:35.043
Now get up
and face the music.

00:13:36.709 --> 00:13:39.209
Get up, Yuya.
You can rest later.

00:13:39.209 --> 00:13:42.476
Everybody's waiting
and watching to see you
Pendulum Summon.

00:13:42.476 --> 00:13:43.943
Don't leave them hanging.

00:13:43.943 --> 00:13:46.043
Work your magic, Yuya!

00:13:46.043 --> 00:13:47.576
It's Pendulum time!

00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:51.509
Pendulum! Pendulum!
Pendulum!

00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:54.576
See? I told you.
They're getting impatient.

00:13:54.576 --> 00:13:57.209
I'm on it! No sweat!

00:13:57.209 --> 00:14:01.376
It's time to swing
into action!

00:14:01.376 --> 00:14:03.676
Yuya, if you're waiting
for applause,

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:05.143
you might be here awhile.

00:14:05.143 --> 00:14:06.376
Right. Here goes.

00:14:06.376 --> 00:14:07.643
Now I draw!

00:14:09.176 --> 00:14:12.309
Excellent. My duel with the
Sledgehammer's a blur,

00:14:12.309 --> 00:14:14.943
but luckily Gong gave me
the play‐by‐play.

00:14:14.943 --> 00:14:16.476
I'll just do what I did then.

00:14:16.476 --> 00:14:20.209
First, I'll use my monsters to
set the Pendulum Scale.

00:14:20.209 --> 00:14:24.176
With my Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon
and my Timegazer Magician,

00:14:24.176 --> 00:14:26.409
I'm good to go.

00:14:34.276 --> 00:14:35.809
Yeah!

00:14:35.809 --> 00:14:37.476
Crank up the Pendulum power!

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:40.243
Pendulum! Pendulum!

00:14:40.243 --> 00:14:42.643
Pendulum! Pendulum!
Pendulum! Pendulum!

00:14:42.643 --> 00:14:44.843
(crowd)
Pendulum! Pendulum!

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:48.276
And now, the moment you've
all been waiting for.

00:14:48.276 --> 00:14:51.309
It's time to Pendulum Summon
and swing into action!

00:14:51.309 --> 00:14:52.509
Aah!

00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:53.676
(all gasp)

00:14:55.076 --> 00:14:56.343
(buzzer)

00:14:58.576 --> 00:15:01.209
(wind blowing)

00:15:01.209 --> 00:15:02.843
Huh?

00:15:02.843 --> 00:15:04.276
Huh?
It didn't work.

00:15:04.276 --> 00:15:05.276
How come?

00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:08.043
What's going on?
I don't get it.

00:15:08.043 --> 00:15:10.276
What the...
Where are they?

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:12.676
Hey, Sword Fish
and Whip Snake,

00:15:12.676 --> 00:15:15.509
get out here right now!

00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:17.409
Why am I getting
an error message?

00:15:17.409 --> 00:15:19.609
I used my Pendulum Cards
the same way last time.

00:15:19.609 --> 00:15:22.609
Pendulum Cards?
What are they?

00:15:22.609 --> 00:15:24.409
(thinking)
What did I do wrong?

00:15:24.409 --> 00:15:26.443
I've got to think back.

00:15:26.443 --> 00:15:27.909
If I'm remembering right,

00:15:27.909 --> 00:15:30.576
it was just after Sledgehammer
destroyed Odd‐Eyes,

00:15:30.576 --> 00:15:32.409
and I was on the brink
of losing.

00:15:32.409 --> 00:15:34.509
It seemed like I didn't
have a chance.

00:15:34.509 --> 00:15:36.776
That must be it.

00:15:36.776 --> 00:15:38.076
I was in major trouble

00:15:38.076 --> 00:15:41.643
and that's when I was suddenly
able to Pendulum Summon.

00:15:41.643 --> 00:15:44.176
It'll only work when
I'm in a jam!

00:15:44.176 --> 00:15:46.276
I'm ending my turn now.

00:15:46.276 --> 00:15:48.809
All right, Zuzu, come at me!

00:15:48.809 --> 00:15:50.843
You want me to attack?

00:15:50.843 --> 00:15:52.009
That's right.

00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:54.009
Throw everything you got
my way.

00:15:54.009 --> 00:15:57.176
If that's what Yuya wants,
then make him happy!

00:15:57.176 --> 00:15:59.209
Quick! Fire things up!

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:01.709
Huh? If you say so.

00:16:01.709 --> 00:16:04.176
I'll start my turn now!

00:16:04.176 --> 00:16:06.276
Whenever there's
a Melodious monster

00:16:06.276 --> 00:16:08.609
taking center stage
on my field,

00:16:08.609 --> 00:16:10.109
I can summon one of the
greatest singers

00:16:10.109 --> 00:16:11.376
that's ever dueled.

00:16:11.376 --> 00:16:14.743
That's your cue, Sonata the
Melodious Diva.

00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:17.776
Now I'll tribute this duet

00:16:17.776 --> 00:16:20.976
and combine their melodies to
summon a whole new monster.

00:16:20.976 --> 00:16:23.276
She'll blow you away with
her musical talent,

00:16:23.276 --> 00:16:26.509
Mozarta the Melodious Maestra.

00:16:29.443 --> 00:16:31.343
To start her concert,

00:16:31.343 --> 00:16:33.643
she'll perform her
special ability.

00:16:33.643 --> 00:16:35.376
By hitting the perfect note,

00:16:35.376 --> 00:16:37.643
I'm able to summon
a Melodious Diva

00:16:37.643 --> 00:16:40.843
that's Level‐four‐or‐below!

00:16:40.843 --> 00:16:44.843
Take a bow, Aria
the Melodious Diva.

00:16:46.376 --> 00:16:48.943
Her harmonies will
overwhelm your Hippo.

00:16:48.943 --> 00:16:52.743
Aria, sing a tune that will
floor Yuya's monster.

00:16:53.909 --> 00:16:56.143
Aah!

00:16:59.009 --> 00:17:00.209
Nice tune.

00:17:00.209 --> 00:17:03.176
Now pull out your Pendulum cards
to pick up the beat.

00:17:03.176 --> 00:17:05.643
Pendulum! Pendulum!

00:17:05.643 --> 00:17:08.109
Pendulum! Pendulum!

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:11.576
Now, hit me with
a high note.

00:17:11.576 --> 00:17:14.043
That's exactly what
I had in mind!

00:17:14.043 --> 00:17:18.443
Mozarta, bring down the house
with your most powerful strain!

00:17:20.476 --> 00:17:22.143
Graceful Wave!

00:17:22.143 --> 00:17:24.143
♪ Ah ♪

00:17:29.009 --> 00:17:31.501
Awesome. Okay,
it's make or break.

00:17:31.501 --> 00:17:34.818
It's the perfect time to
Pendulum Summon!

00:17:34.818 --> 00:17:36.151
(buzzer)

00:17:39.544 --> 00:17:41.178
Aah!

00:17:42.178 --> 00:17:43.152
(all gasp)

00:17:43.152 --> 00:17:44.719
Uhh!

00:17:50.586 --> 00:17:52.652
Huh?

00:17:52.652 --> 00:17:54.808
He lost?

00:17:54.808 --> 00:17:57.141
I wonder
what went wrong.

00:17:57.141 --> 00:17:59.675
I don't get it.
It's over?

00:17:59.675 --> 00:18:01.141
(boy)
That can't be it!

00:18:01.141 --> 00:18:02.575
Bummer.

00:18:02.575 --> 00:18:04.375
If that was
your idea of a gag‐‐

00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:06.575
I wasn't joking around,
honestly!

00:18:06.575 --> 00:18:09.275
You better not be lying.

00:18:09.275 --> 00:18:12.175
Excuse me.
I'm really confused.

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:14.108
Uh‐huh, what is it?

00:18:14.108 --> 00:18:15.541
During your duel,

00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:17.708
you said something about
a Pendulum Card.

00:18:17.708 --> 00:18:19.375
Pendulum Card?

00:18:19.375 --> 00:18:22.375
Well, actually, I'm not sure
what they're officially called.

00:18:22.375 --> 00:18:24.475
That's just the name
I made up for them.

00:18:24.475 --> 00:18:26.375
Can I see one?

00:18:26.375 --> 00:18:27.475
Sure.

00:18:29.075 --> 00:18:31.308
I never saw anything
like that before.

00:18:31.308 --> 00:18:33.508
Yuya says you can't
Pendulum Summon

00:18:33.508 --> 00:18:35.475
unless you have
one of those cards.

00:18:35.475 --> 00:18:36.875
That sounds fishy.

00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:39.908
What if this all Pendulum
stuffs not actually real?

00:18:39.908 --> 00:18:41.141
Good point.

00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:42.708
Maybe he hacked into
the ARC system

00:18:42.708 --> 00:18:44.208
before dueling
Sledgehammer.

00:18:44.208 --> 00:18:47.441
I bet that's how
he was able to summon
three monsters at once.

00:18:47.441 --> 00:18:49.541
He doesn't have the skill
to beat Sledgehammer,

00:18:49.541 --> 00:18:50.741
so he had to cheat.

00:18:50.741 --> 00:18:53.175
Looks like our hero
is really a zero.

00:18:53.175 --> 00:18:56.208
Hey, guys, wait!

00:18:56.208 --> 00:18:58.008
Don't go!

00:18:58.008 --> 00:18:59.208
Uhh!

00:18:59.208 --> 00:19:00.908
(muffled shouting)

00:19:00.908 --> 00:19:03.041
Oh.
This was a new tracksuit.

00:19:11.808 --> 00:19:13.575
Yuya, hold on.

00:19:13.575 --> 00:19:15.508
Those kids were wrong.

00:19:15.508 --> 00:19:17.941
You're no cheater, Yuya.

00:19:21.008 --> 00:19:23.741
You're the greatest duelist
any of us ever saw.

00:19:23.741 --> 00:19:25.708
You didn't need tricks
to beat The Sledgehammer.

00:19:25.708 --> 00:19:27.208
You won fair and square.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:30.608
Tell them all your
Pendulum Summon was real.

00:19:33.708 --> 00:19:36.408
Yuya, you should stand up
and defend yourself

00:19:36.408 --> 00:19:38.675
instead of making your biggest
fan do all the work.

00:19:38.675 --> 00:19:40.741
My biggest fan?

00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:43.275
And your only one,
apparently.

00:19:43.275 --> 00:19:45.575
You know, Tate's been coming
to the You Show School

00:19:45.575 --> 00:19:47.041
to watch your practices.

00:19:47.041 --> 00:19:48.675
He had fun when you
goofed around,

00:19:48.675 --> 00:19:50.308
but your duel against
The Sledgehammer

00:19:50.308 --> 00:19:52.075
turned him into
a true believer.

00:19:52.075 --> 00:19:53.941
Oh, it was awesome!

00:19:53.941 --> 00:19:55.675
You were amazing, Yuya.

00:19:55.675 --> 00:19:59.041
When you were dueling,
it was like magic.

00:19:59.041 --> 00:20:01.808
You and your monsters pulled
thousands of fans together!

00:20:01.808 --> 00:20:04.808
I wanna do
the same thing someday.

00:20:04.808 --> 00:20:07.808
I'll learn to duel
just like you.

00:20:07.808 --> 00:20:09.541
(cheering)

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:13.375
It's the greatest feeling in the
world to make people so happy,

00:20:13.375 --> 00:20:16.241
and now I'm about
to walk away from it forever.

00:20:16.241 --> 00:20:18.775
I don't know.
I'd like to keep dueling...

00:20:18.775 --> 00:20:21.741
Then pick up your deck
and prove to everybody

00:20:21.741 --> 00:20:24.408
that what happened in
the duel wasn't a fluke.

00:20:24.408 --> 00:20:25.675
You think I can?

00:20:25.675 --> 00:20:26.941
Gong knows you can.

00:20:26.941 --> 00:20:29.541
You owe it to Tate.
(chuckles)

00:20:30.675 --> 00:20:33.275
Right! And to me, too!

00:20:33.275 --> 00:20:36.775
We can start a club,
once you enroll.

00:20:36.775 --> 00:20:38.775
Our open house
was a disaster,

00:20:38.775 --> 00:20:40.775
but we got
one new student here.

00:20:40.775 --> 00:20:42.108
New student?
Where?

00:20:42.108 --> 00:20:43.675
Has he made
a tuition payment yet?

00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:47.008
I'm so fired up!
Go Yusho!

00:20:47.008 --> 00:20:48.808
Hmm.

00:20:48.808 --> 00:20:52.608
As a duel‐tainer, I guess
I can't let my fans down.

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:02.775
I promise you guys I'm going
to master Pendulum Summoning.

00:21:02.775 --> 00:21:05.875
Hey, Gong, Zuzu,
let's duel!

00:21:05.875 --> 00:21:08.541
(all laughing)

00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:12.741
So you want me to take
his Pendulum cards?

00:21:12.741 --> 00:21:13.808
All of them, right?

00:21:13.808 --> 00:21:15.341
(man, on speaker)
<i>That is correct.</i>

00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:17.508
How you go about the task
is your business.

00:21:17.508 --> 00:21:19.075
But keep my
name out of it.

00:21:19.075 --> 00:21:21.208
Once you have acquired
the Pendulum cards,

00:21:21.208 --> 00:21:23.175
we will exchange them
for the rare cards

00:21:23.175 --> 00:21:24.475
<i>that you requested.</i>

00:21:24.475 --> 00:21:26.608
Hmm. It's a deal.
