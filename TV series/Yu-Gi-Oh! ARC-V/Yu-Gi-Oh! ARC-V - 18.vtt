WEBVTT

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.566
(Claude)
The match results
are in, sir.

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.700
(Declan)
And?

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.533
Did Yuya Sakaki win?

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.833
Yes, sir.

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:10.000
I must say I'm baffled
by his behavior.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.166
After you persuaded
the Duel Association

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.833
to place Yuya
in a special bracket,

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:14.933
he could have passed

00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.400
straight into the Junior
Arc League Championship.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.900
Instead, he chose to try
and attain the necessary

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.700
number of wins
like any other duelist.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.666
There was no need for me
to interfere at all.

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.233
Claude, it seems Yuya
is determined

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:31.833
to enter the Championship
his way.

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:35.366
I should have expected
nothing less.

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.233
Did he Pendulum Summon
during his match?

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:39.500
Yes, sir.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.033
Our monitoring team
picked up the signal

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:42.666
as he was dueling.

00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:45.333
Did they detect
anything unusual?

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.966
There was nothing
out of the ordinary

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.466
in their report.

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:51.100
The Pendulum energy
appeared to be normal.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.033
Really?

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.700
That means...

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.000
He hasn't
taken the next step yet.

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.966
Mr. President,
there is another matter

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.766
I need to bring
to your attention.

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.300
It is quite intriguing.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.466
Yes, Claude?

00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.933
Well... the Duel Control
Center has observed

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.433
several intense
energy bursts

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:14.266
within the city limits.

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.233
I ordered our top people
to do an analysis,

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:17.400
and they have concluded

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.600
that the bursts
come from Fusion Summons.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.900
Are you sure?

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.933
Yes.

00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.333
At first they suspected
the bursts

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.866
were coming from here,

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.266
since the institute teaches
Fusion Summoning.

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.166
But after further analysis,
the team is sure

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:31.466
the bursts aren't coming
from our instructors

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.633
or their students.

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:35.400
The energy is too powerful,
is that it?

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.500
That's correct, sir.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.833
No one here
has ever produced

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:40.433
a Fusion Summon
that strong.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:41.600
Interesting.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.533
Tell the team to continue
their monitoring

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.100
and to report
anything unusual to me.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.600
Yes, sir.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.933
(thinking)
So many questions,

00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:55.966

are out there.

Polymerization!

00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:08.633
I'm using it to fuse
my Melodious Divas,

00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:10.400
Aria and Sonata!

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.666
Okay, girls, sing out
in perfect harmony on my cue.

00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:16.300
Give me the best fusion melody
you can muster.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.000
I Fusion Summon!

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.466
(buzzer)

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:21.833
Why isn't my
Fusion monster appearing?

00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:23.233
Have I done
something wrong again?

00:03:23.233 --> 00:03:24.433
I did remember
to use my cards

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:26.900
to summon this time,
didn't I?!

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.766
Did you make sure
to put your monster

00:03:28.766 --> 00:03:30.133
in your Extra Deck?

00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:32.433
Huh?
My Extra Deck?

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:33.833
I've told you
a thousand times

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:35.933
you can't stick
Fusion monsters in your deck

00:03:35.933 --> 00:03:37.566
like you do other monsters.

00:03:37.566 --> 00:03:38.733
They go in your Extra Deck.

00:03:38.733 --> 00:03:40.800
I'm not sure
where I put that card.

00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:44.533
Huh?

00:03:44.533 --> 00:03:46.933
How'd you get there?

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:01.666
You had an up‐close look

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:03.733
at two of my duels
already, Zuzu.

00:04:03.733 --> 00:04:05.633
Didn't you learn anything
from watching me?

00:04:05.633 --> 00:04:07.633
I totally could've owned
both of those duels

00:04:07.633 --> 00:04:09.266
even without
Fusion Summoning,

00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:10.433
but I did it anyway

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:12.866
because I hoped
you would learn something.

00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:16.600
Maybe... I just don't have
what it takes.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.566
Unh.

00:04:18.566 --> 00:04:21.800
Or you were too distracted
thinking about you‐know‐who.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.366
Huh? Oh...

00:04:23.366 --> 00:04:25.300
I knew it!

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.566
Whoever this guy is,
he sure got your attention.

00:04:29.566 --> 00:04:32.466
So like, what's his story?

00:04:32.466 --> 00:04:33.966
I have no idea.

00:04:33.966 --> 00:04:35.900
You know his name?

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.033
Not a clue.

00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:38.766
But you've run into him
twice already,

00:04:38.766 --> 00:04:40.666
isn't that right?

00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:41.900
Yeah.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.866
The first time was here.

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:46.200
Hope I'm not interrupting.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.666
And... you are?

00:04:48.666 --> 00:04:51.533
Obviously this mystery man
has you head over heels.

00:04:51.533 --> 00:04:54.266
Ah! Don't be ridiculous!

00:04:54.266 --> 00:04:55.933
Hey, it's only natural.

00:04:55.933 --> 00:04:57.566
Maybe it's just his mask.

00:04:57.566 --> 00:04:58.866
But I've gotta admit,

00:04:58.866 --> 00:05:01.066
the dude does seem
pretty cool.

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:03.266
Talk! Who are you?

00:05:05.266 --> 00:05:07.600
I was really
hoping to duel him,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.866
but then at the last minute

00:05:08.866 --> 00:05:12.300
Julia had to barge in
and ruin everything.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.400
Next time,
he won't get off so easy.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.600
Promise me you won't
ever duel him, Sora.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.733
But why?

00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:21.100
He's way too dangerous.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.066
I Xyz Summon
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon.

00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:27.833
(roaring)

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.033
Trust me, okay?

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:36.500
I mean, think about
all the chaos he caused

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.700
in this warehouse.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.600
The damage he inflicted
was real.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.566
This was no ARC system
malfunction.

00:05:41.566 --> 00:05:43.366
Promise me
you'll stay away from him.

00:05:43.366 --> 00:05:45.633
He's way too dangerous
to mess around with.

00:05:45.633 --> 00:05:49.100
I still
don't get it, though.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.566
I've already put you
through enough.

00:05:52.566 --> 00:05:55.466
Why would he say
something like that to me?

00:06:09.533 --> 00:06:13.066
(groaning)

00:06:13.066 --> 00:06:15.166
There's been
enough suffering.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.466
When's this gonna end?

00:06:17.466 --> 00:06:22.500
(engine revving and whining)

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.666
(Yuto)
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon,
prepare to battle!

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.133
Aah...!

00:06:56.133 --> 00:06:57.733
Ah...

00:07:03.766 --> 00:07:06.000
(Yuto)
Either you tell me
what I need to know,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.933
or I make you tell me.

00:07:08.933 --> 00:07:10.400
Huh.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.833
(tire squealing)

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.333
Did you find Lulu?

00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:22.233
Where could she be?

00:07:27.433 --> 00:07:28.833
Lulu...

00:07:28.833 --> 00:07:29.866
(beeping)

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.900
(Zuzu)
It's shining again!

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.133
And it's brighter than ever!

00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:40.667
(Yuya)
I've been looking everywhere
for you guys!

00:07:40.667 --> 00:07:41.533
Huh?
Huh?

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.000
Is something wrong?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.567
You mean other than the fact

00:07:50.567 --> 00:07:52.633
that you're missing
duel class again?

00:07:52.633 --> 00:07:55.100
Your dad was worried sick
and sent me to look for you!

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.967
(groans)

00:07:58.967 --> 00:08:01.667
Now what?

00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:03.833
Where am I?

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:05.733
The Leo Institute?

00:08:05.733 --> 00:08:08.400
How did I get
all the way over here?

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.300
(whooshing)

00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:18.867
(thinking)This one's stronger
than I expected.

00:08:18.867 --> 00:08:20.700
(panting)

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.600
(Yuto)
It's Shay!

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.567
♪

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.033
Hmm... Zuzu says
her bracelet glows?

00:08:43.033 --> 00:08:44.533
Totally, Mom.

00:08:44.533 --> 00:08:47.500
She also says that whenever
it happens, I show up.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.000
Of course, she's just
trying to pull my leg.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.033
(Sora)
No, Zuzu's bracelet must
have some kind of sensor

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.867
that can detect you
when you're near.

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:57.967
Great, I'm being tracked
like a lost dog!

00:08:57.967 --> 00:08:59.767
Wait, why are you
always showing up here

00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:00.767
at dinnertime?

00:09:00.767 --> 00:09:02.867
Mmm...
because I'm hungry!

00:09:02.867 --> 00:09:04.267
It isn't my fault

00:09:04.267 --> 00:09:06.600
that your mom is
the best cook on the planet.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.900
Aren't you
the sweetest?

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.267
I just hope
that my cooking

00:09:09.267 --> 00:09:11.300
can live up
to your expectations.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.067
I made a brand‐new
dish today

00:09:13.067 --> 00:09:15.500
called Spinach
Surprise‐‐ here.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.000
Why does all this stuff
look so healthy?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.467
(Yoko)
Doesn't it look delish?

00:09:19.467 --> 00:09:22.367
These are all "brain food"
recipes I got from Reed.

00:09:22.367 --> 00:09:23.900
He told me
that your next duel

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.767
will be a real battle
of wits.

00:09:25.767 --> 00:09:28.600
So I decided
to energize your neurons.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.667
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

00:09:30.667 --> 00:09:32.367
Yay!

00:09:32.367 --> 00:09:33.733
Thank you.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.600
You're putting chocolate sauce
on your sardines?!

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.433
Now, now, I've told you
a hundred times before

00:09:43.433 --> 00:09:45.067
that we each have
our own tastes

00:09:45.067 --> 00:09:46.933
and you have no right
to be judgmental.

00:09:46.933 --> 00:09:48.867
Personally,
I find it charming

00:09:48.867 --> 00:09:51.333
when Sora puts peanut butter
on scrambled eggs

00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:52.867
and ketchup
on his ice cream.

00:09:52.867 --> 00:09:55.233
Mmm... yummy!

00:09:55.233 --> 00:09:57.300
If that food's supposed to
make him smarter

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.867
it's got
a lot of work to do.

00:09:58.867 --> 00:10:01.633
Have you heard anything
about your next duel yet?

00:10:01.633 --> 00:10:04.167
Like who your opponent's
gonna be?

00:10:04.167 --> 00:10:06.933
Nope, and I don't wanna
know who it's gonna be.

00:10:06.933 --> 00:10:10.400
Whoever I face is gonna
need a deck transplant.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.267
You better watch it,
'cause there is such a thing

00:10:12.267 --> 00:10:14.500
as being
too sure of yourself.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.733
Look who's talking.

00:10:15.733 --> 00:10:17.400
You're so sure
Zuzu likes you

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.600
that you don't even notice

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.733
when she flips
for another guy.

00:10:20.733 --> 00:10:23.533
What do you mean,
another guy?

00:10:23.533 --> 00:10:26.067
Uh, not that it matters...

00:10:26.067 --> 00:10:28.167
'cause Zuzu
isn't my girlfriend.

00:10:28.167 --> 00:10:30.667
(Zuzu)
I don't believe you, Dad.

00:10:30.667 --> 00:10:32.767
Take it easy, it's true.

00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:34.933
You've had that bracelet
ever since you were born.

00:10:34.933 --> 00:10:37.333
You seriously expect me
to believe

00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:39.700
I've been wearing this
since I was in diapers?

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.600
Look, this isn't so easy
to explain, but I'll try.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.533
Save it, Dad!

00:10:44.533 --> 00:10:46.000
Zuzu, hold on!

00:10:47.633 --> 00:10:49.167
Listen, I know
you're upset,

00:10:49.167 --> 00:10:51.500
and I know it's not
the best time to ask,

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.667
but is what I heard true?

00:10:53.667 --> 00:10:56.633
Are you really studying
Fusion Summoning with Sora?

00:10:56.633 --> 00:10:59.133
The training offered at your own
father's duel school

00:10:59.133 --> 00:11:00.767
isn't good enough,
is that it?

00:11:00.767 --> 00:11:02.367
If this gets spread
around town,

00:11:02.367 --> 00:11:03.667
we'll never get
anyone to study here...

00:11:03.667 --> 00:11:05.067
(Yuto)
Hope I'm not interrupting.

00:11:05.067 --> 00:11:06.867
I've already put you
through enough.

00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:08.900
Enough!

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.967
I've got to stop thinking
about him all the time!

00:11:11.967 --> 00:11:13.167
Oh...

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.433
(sobs)

00:11:18.433 --> 00:11:21.533
Dad can't understand,
but we almost lost our school

00:11:21.533 --> 00:11:23.833
because my dueling
didn't measure up.

00:11:23.833 --> 00:11:25.667
I won't let that
happen again.

00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:27.200
That's why I need Sora

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.800
to help me master
Fusion Summoning.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.033
Because something tells me

00:11:31.033 --> 00:11:33.800
there's a lot more
trouble ahead.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.833
It seems like
all my problems started

00:11:36.833 --> 00:11:39.533
because of this
stupid bracelet!

00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:41.167
Either that...

00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:42.267
(sighs)

00:11:43.767 --> 00:11:46.600
Or it could be
I'm losing my mind.

00:11:49.832 --> 00:11:51.999
(Declan)
Where did you get these?

00:11:51.999 --> 00:11:54.665
Both cards were delivered
to the school this morning,

00:11:54.665 --> 00:11:56.499
but we don't know
who sent them.

00:11:56.499 --> 00:11:59.932
So... Marco and Herc
have been immortalized.

00:11:59.932 --> 00:12:02.165
They're two of our
top duelists.

00:12:02.165 --> 00:12:04.565
Perhaps someone is trying to
send the institute a message,

00:12:04.565 --> 00:12:05.965
but if that's the case,

00:12:05.965 --> 00:12:08.232
I wonder what
the message could be?

00:12:08.232 --> 00:12:12.732
I'm not sure, but yesterday
our detectors picked up

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:16.999
a powerful Xyz burst
from somewhere in the city.

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:19.032
Then there's this:
Herc's disappearance

00:12:19.032 --> 00:12:21.999
apparently occurred around
the time of that event.

00:12:21.999 --> 00:12:23.532
Then we received a tip

00:12:23.532 --> 00:12:25.632
that Herc was sealed
inside a card.

00:12:25.632 --> 00:12:27.332
Inside a card?

00:12:27.332 --> 00:12:29.732
Seriously?
But that's absurd!

00:12:29.732 --> 00:12:32.965
How could anyone
put a human in a card?

00:12:32.965 --> 00:12:35.165
I don't know.

00:12:35.165 --> 00:12:36.532
The technology
is beyond anything

00:12:36.532 --> 00:12:38.732
I can possibly imagine.

00:12:38.732 --> 00:12:40.899
Order the lab to complete
a molecular analysis

00:12:40.899 --> 00:12:43.732
of both these cards
immediately.

00:12:43.732 --> 00:12:45.365
I want some answers.

00:12:45.365 --> 00:12:48.199
If they're inside,
can we save them?

00:12:48.199 --> 00:12:50.199
We'll do our best.

00:12:50.199 --> 00:12:52.299
But until we know
what we're dealing with,

00:12:52.299 --> 00:12:54.032
I don't like our odds.

00:12:54.032 --> 00:12:57.265
I wonder... why aren't
there three cards?

00:12:57.265 --> 00:12:58.499
Huh?

00:12:58.499 --> 00:13:00.799
Three were attacked.

00:13:00.799 --> 00:13:03.099
Before Marco and Herc vanished,

00:13:03.099 --> 00:13:05.565
Sylvio Sawatari
was also ambushed.

00:13:05.565 --> 00:13:08.865
Marco and Herc are trapped
in these cards...

00:13:08.865 --> 00:13:10.132
Why isn't Sylvio?

00:13:10.132 --> 00:13:11.632
Why did he end up
in the hospital

00:13:11.632 --> 00:13:12.999
after his attack

00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:14.532
instead of in a card
like the others?

00:13:14.532 --> 00:13:16.799
It's possible
that the assault on Sylvio

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:18.532
is unrelated to the others.

00:13:18.532 --> 00:13:20.232
Which means there could be

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:22.232
at least two attackers
out there.

00:13:22.232 --> 00:13:23.799
Do you really think so?

00:13:23.799 --> 00:13:26.265
(Claude)
Councilman Sawatari,
you can't go in there!

00:13:26.265 --> 00:13:29.932
I'm an important man,
and I will not be kept waiting!

00:13:29.932 --> 00:13:31.032
There you are.

00:13:31.032 --> 00:13:32.699
(Henrietta)
Councilman Sawatari.

00:13:32.699 --> 00:13:34.132
(Claude)
You can't just
barge in like this.

00:13:34.132 --> 00:13:35.299
Please leave at once.

00:13:35.299 --> 00:13:36.799
I'm not going anywhere!

00:13:36.799 --> 00:13:39.932
I have business
with these people!

00:13:39.932 --> 00:13:41.032
I tried to tell
the Councilman

00:13:41.032 --> 00:13:42.599
he needs an appointment.
I just‐‐

00:13:42.599 --> 00:13:44.665
You're gonna need
an appointment with your lawyer

00:13:44.665 --> 00:13:46.565
if you don't stop
harassing me, bub!

00:13:46.565 --> 00:13:48.265
I'll meet with
the Councilman now.

00:13:48.265 --> 00:13:49.399
Yes, sir.

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:51.099
I came here for answers

00:13:51.099 --> 00:13:52.865
and I won't leave
till I get them.

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:55.899
I don't know what answers
you're talking about.

00:13:55.899 --> 00:13:57.532
Don't try
giving me the runaround

00:13:57.532 --> 00:13:58.799
'cause I know exactly

00:13:58.799 --> 00:14:00.765
what's been going on
around here!

00:14:00.765 --> 00:14:03.399
I have eyes and ears
everywhere!

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:04.532
My sources tell me

00:14:04.532 --> 00:14:06.032
there's been
a number of attacks

00:14:06.032 --> 00:14:07.799
on duelists associated
with this school

00:14:07.799 --> 00:14:09.399
and that
you're hushing it up!

00:14:11.432 --> 00:14:14.399
Eee... so the stories
are true then.

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:16.432
Well, Councilman...

00:14:16.432 --> 00:14:18.165
Your sources are correct.

00:14:18.165 --> 00:14:19.932
Then why haven't
you done anything

00:14:19.932 --> 00:14:21.532
to stop this maniac?

00:14:21.532 --> 00:14:23.499
You should have the police
arrest him immediately!

00:14:23.499 --> 00:14:26.299
An investigation
is already underway.

00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:27.899
Underway?!

00:14:27.899 --> 00:14:29.865
But there's nothing
to investigate!

00:14:29.865 --> 00:14:32.532
My son already ID'd
his attacker.

00:14:32.532 --> 00:14:37.632
There isn't the slightest doubt,
it was Yuya Sakaki!

00:14:40.199 --> 00:14:43.999
Your son is still convinced
that it was him?

00:14:43.999 --> 00:14:45.999
We haven't spoken
since he left the hospital,

00:14:45.999 --> 00:14:48.265
but I'm sure his story
hasn't changed.

00:14:48.265 --> 00:14:49.499
There isn't
the slightest doubt

00:14:49.499 --> 00:14:52.032
that Yuya Sakaki is guilty!

00:14:52.032 --> 00:14:54.532
The Chairwoman agreed
and promised me

00:14:54.532 --> 00:14:57.165
that she would see to it
that justice was done.

00:14:57.165 --> 00:15:00.132
But this Sakaki character
is still running around free

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:02.665
and ambushing helpless duelists
as we speak!

00:15:02.665 --> 00:15:04.799
If you won't take action
to stop this menace,

00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:06.165
then I will!

00:15:06.165 --> 00:15:07.465
I will personally see to it

00:15:07.465 --> 00:15:09.765
that the police fan out
across this city

00:15:09.765 --> 00:15:12.165
and apprehend Yuya Sakaki
on sight!

00:15:12.165 --> 00:15:14.132
Please stay out of this.

00:15:14.132 --> 00:15:15.432
Listen here!

00:15:15.432 --> 00:15:18.032
(bangs desk)
Ooh!

00:15:18.032 --> 00:15:21.399
An investigation
is underway.

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:25.165
No moves will be made
until it is complete.

00:15:25.165 --> 00:15:27.632
The Leo Corporation
and Leo Institute

00:15:27.632 --> 00:15:30.632
are working hard to determine
the true culprit.

00:15:30.632 --> 00:15:33.599
But we already know
the culprit's Yuya Sakaki!

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:35.799
Yuya has not
attacked anyone.

00:15:35.799 --> 00:15:37.265
Huh?

00:15:37.265 --> 00:15:41.532
I can promise you
our investigation will succeed.

00:15:41.532 --> 00:15:44.899
