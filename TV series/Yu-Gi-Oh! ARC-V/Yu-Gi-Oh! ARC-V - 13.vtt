WEBVTT

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:04.370
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.673
(Ally)
Poor Yuya must be
a nervous wreck!

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.408
If he doesn't win...

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:09.976
Our school's theirs.

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:11.545
Yuya...

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:13.980
The future of
my school's at stake.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.149
But I'm up for the challenge!

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.919
(Tate)
All you Leo fanatics
better watch out!

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.988
(Frederick)
Your team is strong,
but we have Pendulum power!

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:23.957
Your poor friend doesn't
stand a chance

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.359
against Declan.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.729
(Yuya)
Since you did me a favor by
letting me choose the field,

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:30.931
I'll let you go first.

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:34.601
I Fusion Summon
Triple D Flame King Genghis!

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.439
The guy is
a fusion master!

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:42.442
I tune my Level 3
Double D Nighthowl

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:43.944
with my Level 4 Lilith!

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:46.947
I Synchro Summon

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:49.883
Level 7 Triple D
Gust King Alexander!

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.654
A Synchro Monster?

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:55.889
So he can
Synchro Summon too?

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:59.159
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.061
I Xyz Summon!

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.329
Triple D Wave
King Caesar!

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.735
He can summon
three different ways!

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.637
That's amazing!

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:13.173
I should warn you
that I have not even begun

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:15.942
to unleash my most powerful
monsters.

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:17.944
The worst is yet to come.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:19.412
That sounds rather
terrifying,

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.346
don't you think?

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:24.484
I can assure you that
the reality is far worse.

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:37.290
Flame King Genghis,
de‐fang that Whip Snake!

00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:42.395
I got something
that'll dance to

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:43.997
your defense Whip Snake!

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.600
The spell
Hippo Carnival!

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.268
It lets me summon
three carnival craving

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:50.737
Hippo Tokens in
defense mode.

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:53.273
Now my Snake's protected
from getting scorched

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:54.775
because your
Flame King is forced

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:56.843
to give one of my Hippo's
the heave ho!

00:02:58.545 --> 00:02:59.580
Awesome!

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.582
That was quick thinking
on Yuya's part.

00:03:01.582 --> 00:03:03.283
Yeah, that move
got Gong going!

00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:07.453
Well, then this will
surely blow you away!

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:09.823
Gust King Alexander, take out
another Hippo!

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:15.228
My Gust King
isn't through, however,

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:18.064
because he's also using
his special ability.

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:20.466
Since he vanquished one
of your monsters in battle,

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:23.670
another of your monsters will
now meet its ruin as well!

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.671
(gasping)

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:29.943
(groaning)

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.077
Caesar!

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.179
His Whip Snake
is now wide open!

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:34.480
Crack that Whip!

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.225
Whip Snake!

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:47.293
(beeping)

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:52.298
(Frederick)
Four monsters
wiped out in one turn?

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.000
That should be verboten!

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.001
I've accomplished
everything

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:56.469
I set out to
do in this turn.

00:03:57.938 --> 00:03:59.072
Nicely done!

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.707
That was
a great performance.

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:02.108
I'm especially impressed

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:04.244
that you were able to summon
three different ways.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:06.780
Now I take
center stage!

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:11.051
I can't Fusion, Synchro
or Xyz Summon like you.

00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:12.385
But with Pendulum power,

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:13.954
I can swing
this duel my way!

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:17.357
Ready or not,
here I go!

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:23.463
Ready or not,
here I go!

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:26.700
Excellent!

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.803
Friends and fans,
your attention, please!

00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:31.805
So far, I've been
warming up

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:33.907
in preparation
for my main act!

00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:36.442
But now there's gonna be
no holding back!

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.011
I promise to dazzle you

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:41.648
with my spectacular display
of dueling knowhow!

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:43.449
I know what's coming next!

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.151
I'll use
Stargazer Magician

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:46.753
and Timegazer Magician

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:48.822
to set
the Pendulum Scale.

00:04:48.822 --> 00:04:51.257
I'm taking control of this
duel starting now!

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:07.574
I now have the power
to summon monsters

00:05:07.574 --> 00:05:09.142
from level two
through level seven

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.877
all at the same time!

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:12.445
Swing far,
Pendulum!

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:14.280
Carve the arc of victory!

00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:20.220
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:25.759
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.630
(roaring)

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:32.165
Let 'em hear you roar,

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.300
Performapal
Fire Mufflerlion!

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.301
(roaring)

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:37.604
Oh, boy!

00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:38.972
A new monster!

00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:40.974
He's looks
totally adorable!

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:42.676
Und ferocious!

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:44.444
Sic that Lion
on 'em, Yuya!

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:45.946
Attack!

00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:48.281
Your school
is counting on you!

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:50.951
My monsters are eager
to entertain you!

00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:54.254
I direct your attention
to Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:05:54.254 --> 00:05:56.322
Its act is truly
overpowering...

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:58.992
and guaranteed to make you
leap out of your seats!

00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:02.596
(gasping)

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:07.834
Here we go,
Odd‐Eyes!

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:09.269
It's showtime!

00:06:11.505 --> 00:06:14.007
Target that Flame King!

00:06:14.007 --> 00:06:16.142
Bowl this crowd over
with the most intense attack

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.578
they've ever seen!

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:19.045
(growling)

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:22.883
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:29.823
And to pump up
the excitement,

00:06:29.823 --> 00:06:31.658
Odd‐Eyes will use
its special ability!

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:35.261
Since Flame King is
at least level 5,

00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:37.363
Odd‐Eyes can
double the damage!

00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:38.565
Reaction Force!

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:46.840
(beeping)

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.074
Aced it!

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.511
Now keep decking Declan's team
and don't let up!

00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:51.545
(Frederick)
Jah!

00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:52.845
Bash 'em in
their glockenspiels!

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:55.348
Fire Mufflerlion
takes center stage next

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:58.184
to showcase his incredible
special ability!

00:06:58.184 --> 00:06:59.318
When a Pendulum monster

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:01.054
destroys one
of your guys,

00:07:01.054 --> 00:07:03.356
Mufflerlion gives
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:06.125
200 attack points and
lets it attack again!

00:07:07.526 --> 00:07:08.527
Perfect!

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:09.962
It's now or never,
Odd‐Eyes!

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.630
Go for it!

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:12.831
(roaring)

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:18.771
(beeping)

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:20.606
That trick's
too hot to handle!

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:21.907
No one outdoes Yuya

00:07:21.907 --> 00:07:23.909
in the razzle‐dazzle
department.

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:26.079
When it comes to
ranglin' monsters...

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:28.147
the kid's a natural!

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:29.648
What a dueltainer!

00:07:29.648 --> 00:07:32.585
He's just like his old man,
only shorter!

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:34.187
Gust King Alexander,

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:37.022
my Dragon's setting
its sights on you next!

00:07:37.022 --> 00:07:38.724
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:45.731
Now, Odd‐Eyes, use your
special ability

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:46.932
to double the damage!

00:07:46.932 --> 00:07:48.134
Reaction Force!

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:54.573
(beeping)

00:07:54.573 --> 00:07:56.809
Ooh, I'm tingling from
my hair to my lederhosen!

00:07:57.743 --> 00:07:59.112
♪

00:08:04.883 --> 00:08:05.751
Yeah!

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.586
I'm in the zone today!

00:08:07.586 --> 00:08:11.324
I activate the Action Spell
called Wonder Chance!

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.491
Wonder what it does?

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:14.893
It lets one
monster attack again!

00:08:14.893 --> 00:08:17.730
Forward, Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.299
Focus your
firepower on King Caesar!

00:08:29.942 --> 00:08:31.077
(beeping)

00:08:31.877 --> 00:08:33.011
All right!

00:08:33.011 --> 00:08:34.547
He dethroned
King Caesar!

00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:36.215
This duel
has taken a 180

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:38.384
and now Yuya's in
complete control!

00:08:38.384 --> 00:08:40.753
He's such
a monster meister!

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:42.521
It's such a relief!

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:44.223
I was worried
we'd lose the school,

00:08:44.223 --> 00:08:46.459
but even though Declan can
summon three different ways,

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:48.727
Yuya's Pendulum Summoning
is overpowering!

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:55.834
Well, folks, I hope
everybody enjoyed the act!

00:08:55.834 --> 00:08:57.103
That's all for now,

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:59.772
'cause Fire Mufflerlion
isn't allowed to attack.

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:02.975
And my Odd‐Eyes is also
battled‐out for this turn.

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:04.843
Thanks for your support!

00:09:04.843 --> 00:09:06.112
And don't worry.

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:08.114
Both monsters will be back
for an encore performance

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:09.415
on my next turn...

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:11.284
and it will be
even more amazing!

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.720
Good job, Odd‐Eyes,
you were great!

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:18.624
♪

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:21.294
(gasping)

00:09:22.761 --> 00:09:24.029
What's going on?

00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:25.564
How is this
possible?

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.601
They're back!

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:30.903
But I saw
Yuya destroy them!

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:32.405
Gong, too...

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:33.972
What happened?

00:09:33.972 --> 00:09:35.141
(Declan)
My monsters were saved

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:37.710
thanks to King Caesar's
special ability!

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.212
What ability?

00:09:39.212 --> 00:09:41.047
It's quite impressive.

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:42.981
After the battle,
the mighty Ceasar

00:09:42.981 --> 00:09:45.051
used one of his
Overlay Units.

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:47.286
This allowed him to
re‐summon all monsters

00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:49.055
that were destroyed by
you in battle!

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:52.958
Caesar can revive
your whole team?

00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:56.129
Is he a monster or some
kind of miracle worker?

00:09:56.129 --> 00:09:57.996
Of course...

00:09:57.996 --> 00:10:00.933
such immense powers
come at a great price.

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:03.836
Specifically, every monster
that Caesar revived

00:10:03.836 --> 00:10:06.705
will cost me life
points on my next turn.

00:10:06.705 --> 00:10:08.107
In fact, I must give up

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:10.909
1,000 life points
for each one.

00:10:10.909 --> 00:10:14.280
So the damage will be
three times one thousand.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.716
Und if you add that up und
subtract his life points...

00:10:17.716 --> 00:10:20.586
it means Declan will soon
be going kaput!

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:21.787
(Sora)
Get real!

00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:23.122
Declan wouldn't have
planned this

00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:24.590
without giving
himself an out.

00:10:25.824 --> 00:10:27.826
The boy is correct!

00:10:27.826 --> 00:10:29.828
I'm activating
a trap card!

00:10:29.828 --> 00:10:32.365
By using Triple D Human
Resources,

00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:35.634
I can relocate three
Triple D Monsters to my deck.

00:10:35.634 --> 00:10:37.970
Then I can recruit two
Double D monsters

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.106
from my deck and send
them straight to my hand!

00:10:42.007 --> 00:10:45.311
(Sora)
See, he moved his monsters
to avoid taking damage.

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.080
I'll put one card
facedown.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.915
Your turn!

00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:51.317
This is one of
the coolest duels

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:53.119
I've ever been part of.

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:55.621
So far it's been
full of surprises.

00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:58.224
You've done an excellent job
of keeping me in the dark

00:10:58.224 --> 00:10:59.425
and I love not knowing

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:01.227
what you'll
throw at me next!

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:03.529
I, too,
have enjoyed our duel.

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:06.199
The experience has been
most educational...

00:11:06.199 --> 00:11:08.234
especially when you
showed me what it's like

00:11:08.234 --> 00:11:09.568
to be on the receiving end

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:11.304
of one of your Pendulum
monster's attacks.

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:13.772
Now I'll
return the favor.

00:11:15.574 --> 00:11:18.677
I have unlocked the secrets
of many forms of summoning,

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:21.047
including one that
is highly prized by you!

00:11:22.915 --> 00:11:25.017
Prepare yourself
for a surprise!

00:11:27.253 --> 00:11:28.787
Using these cards...

00:11:28.787 --> 00:11:32.158
Double D Savant Galilei
and Double D Savant Kepler

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:34.360
I'm going to set
the Pendulum Scale!

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.628
No way!

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:36.629
(gasping)

00:11:38.961 --> 00:11:41.800
I'll beat you at
your own game, Yuya!

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.801
(beeping)

00:11:48.627 --> 00:11:51.430
Just like you,
I can also Pendulum Summon!

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.999
I can now summon monsters
from level two through nine

00:11:53.999 --> 00:11:55.601
at the same time!

00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:57.536
Maybe the guy is just
bluffing...

00:11:57.536 --> 00:11:59.204
I don't think so.

00:11:59.204 --> 00:12:00.238
Me either!

00:12:03.542 --> 00:12:06.478
The energy of the universe
swings between the forces of

00:12:06.478 --> 00:12:08.146
darkness and of light.

00:12:08.146 --> 00:12:11.817
I shall now harness the power
of this eternal oscillation!

00:12:11.817 --> 00:12:13.685
I Pendulum Summon

00:12:13.685 --> 00:12:16.555
and call upon my
three monsters to emerge!

00:12:18.457 --> 00:12:19.458
(gasping)

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.798
Behold the three
fearsome immortals

00:12:26.798 --> 00:12:29.501
who can command
the obedience of all!

00:12:29.501 --> 00:12:32.604
My trio of Triple D Doom
King Armageddons!

00:12:41.112 --> 00:12:42.381
(quivering)

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.285
But how?

00:12:46.285 --> 00:12:48.820
How did he learn to
Pendulum Summon?

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.356
Attack!

00:12:50.356 --> 00:12:53.392
Your target,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:12:53.392 --> 00:12:55.327
Destroy Yuya's monster!

00:12:59.765 --> 00:13:00.766
Yuya!

00:13:02.968 --> 00:13:04.336
♪

00:13:08.173 --> 00:13:10.075
I snagged
the Action Spell Miracle!

00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:20.251
It saves my monster
from destruction

00:13:20.251 --> 00:13:22.588
and cuts the damage
I take in half!

00:13:22.588 --> 00:13:25.391
You'll need more than
a miracle to save you!

00:13:25.391 --> 00:13:27.993
My second Doom King
Armageddon now attacks!

00:13:33.632 --> 00:13:34.633
(beeping)

00:13:36.067 --> 00:13:37.369
He lost Odd‐Eyes!

00:13:37.369 --> 00:13:39.738
Well, at least it won't
go to the graveyard,

00:13:39.738 --> 00:13:41.773
since it's
a Pendulum Monster.

00:13:44.376 --> 00:13:45.677
I see.

00:13:45.677 --> 00:13:48.179
His Dragon was
sent to his Extra Deck.

00:13:48.179 --> 00:13:51.317
And the same will happen
to that fiery feline.

00:13:51.317 --> 00:13:52.884
No matter.

00:13:52.884 --> 00:13:56.655
Doom King Armageddon,
finish off that Mufflerlion!

00:13:56.655 --> 00:13:58.256
(Yuya)
I need another Action Card!

00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:11.002
(beeping)

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.839
He's running out of
life points!

00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:14.940
Yuya...

00:14:16.107 --> 00:14:18.043
I gotta know!

00:14:18.043 --> 00:14:21.380
Declan, how did you
learn to Pendulum Summon?

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.350
That is really none
of your concern, Yuya.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.818
Impressive work, Declan.

00:14:26.818 --> 00:14:29.721
Now that you have mastered the
Pendulum Summoning technique,

00:14:29.721 --> 00:14:31.323
the You Show School
is finished.

00:14:33.258 --> 00:14:35.427
(Henrietta)
It is a complete victory!

00:14:35.427 --> 00:14:38.196
Once we've added Pendulum
studies to the Leo curriculum,

00:14:38.196 --> 00:14:41.099
I can have You Show
razed to the ground!

00:14:42.468 --> 00:14:45.103
How did he master
so many techniques?

00:14:45.103 --> 00:14:46.705
It almost seems too easy.

00:14:46.705 --> 00:14:48.607
If you ask me,
there's something strange about

00:14:48.607 --> 00:14:50.842
this Declan character.

00:14:50.842 --> 00:14:52.311
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:54.946
I only had one advantage
and now that's gone...

00:14:55.581 --> 00:14:56.582
No!

00:14:56.582 --> 00:14:58.417
Don't give up
on yourself, Yuya!

00:14:58.417 --> 00:14:59.918
Ya gotta dig down deep!

00:14:59.918 --> 00:15:01.787
Keep fighting!

00:15:03.221 --> 00:15:04.456
It's not over!

00:15:04.456 --> 00:15:05.957
There's still
a lot of duel left!

00:15:07.326 --> 00:15:09.160
You have to get back
in the zone.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.662
Stop worrying about losing

00:15:10.662 --> 00:15:12.331
and focus how
you can win this!

00:15:14.132 --> 00:15:16.001
But he has his own
Pendulum monsters.

00:15:17.736 --> 00:15:20.439
I thought I was the only one
who had Pendulum cards...

00:15:20.439 --> 00:15:22.608
No, none of
that matters now!

00:15:22.608 --> 00:15:24.410
There's only one thing
that's important!

00:15:25.577 --> 00:15:27.513
Saving my school!

00:15:27.513 --> 00:15:28.614
(Yuya)
I can do this!

00:15:28.614 --> 00:15:30.215
There aren't any cards
in my hand,

00:15:30.215 --> 00:15:31.750
but if I can
draw the right one

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.218
I can make things
swing my way!

00:15:37.756 --> 00:15:38.924
(Yuya)
I can do this!

00:15:38.924 --> 00:15:40.492
There aren't any cards
in my hand,

00:15:40.492 --> 00:15:42.193
but if I can
draw the right one

00:15:42.193 --> 00:15:43.829
I can make things
swing my way!

00:15:46.632 --> 00:15:48.367
I've done it!

00:15:48.367 --> 00:15:50.569
Okay, get ready!

00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:52.237
Don't let me down,
Magicians!

00:15:52.237 --> 00:15:53.639
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:55.307
Carve
the arc of victory!

00:15:58.076 --> 00:16:01.413
My monsters are ready...
to swing into action!

00:16:04.483 --> 00:16:07.619
First, let's welcome back
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.959
And it'll be joined
by its old friend,

00:16:13.959 --> 00:16:17.629
Performapal
Fire Mufflerlion!

00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:20.899
Plus, Performapal Partnaga
is joining the party!

00:16:24.135 --> 00:16:26.438
(Frederick)
He went for
a triple play this time!

00:16:26.438 --> 00:16:29.007
That's a sure sign
he ain't givin' up!

00:16:29.007 --> 00:16:30.241
Yuya still has a chance!

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.112
Partnaga, use your
special ability to give

00:16:34.112 --> 00:16:35.614
Odd‐Eyes a hand!

00:16:35.614 --> 00:16:37.148
Once Partnaga is summoned,

00:16:37.148 --> 00:16:39.451
it can use its special ability
to boost a monster

00:16:39.451 --> 00:16:40.886
by 300 attack points

00:16:40.886 --> 00:16:42.954
for every Performapal
on the field!

00:16:42.954 --> 00:16:45.724
I'm sure you don't need me to
do the math for you, do I?

00:16:45.724 --> 00:16:47.426
(Declan)
Indeed not.

00:16:47.426 --> 00:16:49.260
You have added
600 attack points

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.261
to your Odd‐Eyes.

00:16:51.663 --> 00:16:53.965
(roaring)

00:16:53.965 --> 00:16:56.201
(Yuya)
The odds are
totally in my favor now!

00:16:56.201 --> 00:16:59.170
Those Armageddon creeps
are going down one by one

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.672
and it's all thanks
to Odd‐Eyes.

00:17:02.273 --> 00:17:05.176
It'll pour on
the heat with its extra power,

00:17:05.176 --> 00:17:08.580
and then use its special ability
to deal double the damage!

00:17:10.181 --> 00:17:12.718
Next we'll
highlight teamwork!

00:17:12.718 --> 00:17:15.253
With Mufflerlion's special
ability,

00:17:15.253 --> 00:17:18.256
Odd‐Eyes gets to
attack a second time

00:17:18.256 --> 00:17:20.759
to take out Declan's second
Doom Armageddon!

00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:26.064
Finally, I'll add
some razzle‐dazzle!

00:17:26.064 --> 00:17:28.534
Since Odd‐Eyes destroyed
two monsters,

00:17:28.534 --> 00:17:31.570
I can activate my trap
One Two Jump!

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:35.040
That card will let Odd‐Eyes
attack for a third time!

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.675
As a bonus, the attack points

00:17:36.675 --> 00:17:39.144
of Doom Armegeddon
will be cut in half!

00:17:39.144 --> 00:17:40.946
That should give Odd‐Eyes
the upper hand

00:17:40.946 --> 00:17:43.482
and help him lower
the boom on Declan!

00:17:43.482 --> 00:17:45.584
It's a perfect plan!

00:17:45.584 --> 00:17:48.287
We just have to seal the deal
with a flawless performance!

00:17:49.921 --> 00:17:51.723
We're on!

00:17:51.723 --> 00:17:53.024
Odd‐Eyes, take aim,

00:17:53.024 --> 00:17:55.226
and take out
Doom Armegeddon Number 1!

00:17:57.463 --> 00:17:58.764
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:18:03.335 --> 00:18:05.404
Now, it's just like
we rehearsed.

00:18:05.404 --> 00:18:08.740
You can use your special
ability to double the damage!

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.941
Reaction Force!

00:18:15.747 --> 00:18:16.748
(beeping)

00:18:18.116 --> 00:18:20.051
My monster may have
been destroyed

00:18:20.051 --> 00:18:21.953
but it's only
a temporary setback.

00:18:22.821 --> 00:18:24.189
Step two...

00:18:24.189 --> 00:18:26.525
Fire Mufflerlion's
special ability‐‐

00:18:26.525 --> 00:18:28.093
Will do nothing because
I activate

00:18:28.093 --> 00:18:29.661
Armageddon's ability!

00:18:29.661 --> 00:18:30.896
Uh‐oh!

00:18:30.896 --> 00:18:32.598
You should be
worried, Yuya...

00:18:32.598 --> 00:18:34.065
very worried!

00:18:34.065 --> 00:18:36.201
Once Armageddon
exits the field,

00:18:36.201 --> 00:18:38.203
its attack points are
immediately sent to

00:18:38.203 --> 00:18:39.671
each of my
remaining monsters

00:18:39.671 --> 00:18:41.206
until the turn ends!

00:18:41.206 --> 00:18:43.174
As a result,
the two Armageddons

00:18:43.174 --> 00:18:44.610
that are still
on my field

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.479
will both have their attack
points increased by 3,000!

00:18:48.614 --> 00:18:50.248
6,000 each?

00:18:50.248 --> 00:18:51.783
That's incredible!

00:18:51.783 --> 00:18:52.884
Yuya!

00:18:52.884 --> 00:18:54.252
How can he
destroy them?

00:18:54.252 --> 00:18:56.588
He'll need
a lot of firepower.

00:18:56.588 --> 00:18:58.123
There's two of
them to beat.

00:18:58.123 --> 00:18:59.425
Good luck, Yuya!

00:18:59.425 --> 00:19:00.859
You'll need it!

00:19:00.859 --> 00:19:02.494
Looks like
the school's closin' up.

00:19:02.494 --> 00:19:03.895
It can't.

00:19:06.598 --> 00:19:08.166
I'm stuck.

00:19:08.166 --> 00:19:09.701
I'll have
to end my turn.

00:19:13.372 --> 00:19:14.373
(beeping)

00:19:16.074 --> 00:19:18.143
We've reached
the end... for you!

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.394
Oh, no!

00:19:40.699 --> 00:19:42.768
Where did they go?
Ja, where?

00:19:42.768 --> 00:19:45.170
Maybe things are going all
haywire because Declan

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.573
hasn't perfected
Pendulum Summoning yet!

00:19:49.775 --> 00:19:51.510
It gives
Yuya an opening!

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.513
Yeah, even if Declan is able
to Pendulum Summon again,

00:19:54.513 --> 00:19:57.549
he can only bring out monsters
that are Level 3 or 4!

00:19:57.549 --> 00:19:59.785
Maybe I got a chance.

00:19:59.785 --> 00:20:03.154
(Yuya)
As long as Declan's monster
is Level 5‐or‐below,

00:20:03.154 --> 00:20:06.858
Partnaga's special ability
can stop it from attacking.

00:20:06.858 --> 00:20:10.396
Any monster he Pendulum Summons
will be powerless against me.

00:20:12.263 --> 00:20:15.367
(Declan)
I thought these prototypes would
be up to the task...

00:20:15.367 --> 00:20:18.437
but it's clear now there's
still a lot of work to be done.

00:20:19.471 --> 00:20:20.672
Wait a minute...

00:20:20.672 --> 00:20:22.374
why didn't I think
of this before?

00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:27.546
(laughing maniacally)

00:20:30.949 --> 00:20:34.953
I didn't realize 'til now how
complex Pendulum Summoning is,

00:20:34.953 --> 00:20:37.222
or how incredible its
potential could be!

00:20:38.123 --> 00:20:39.658
What's wrong?

00:20:39.658 --> 00:20:41.226
Nothing is wrong.

00:20:41.226 --> 00:20:43.362
I just realized
there's a way to evolve

00:20:43.362 --> 00:20:45.030
the Pendulum method!

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.766
And I'm going to
show you right now!

00:20:47.766 --> 00:20:49.535
(Yuya)
Evolve Pendulum Summoning!

00:20:49.535 --> 00:20:50.969
What's he going to do?

00:20:50.969 --> 00:20:52.438
It's Marco,
Madame Chairwoman.

00:20:52.438 --> 00:20:53.772
What's going on?

00:20:55.173 --> 00:20:56.207
We have to tell him!

00:20:58.076 --> 00:20:59.578
This better
be important.

00:20:59.578 --> 00:21:00.746
I'm afraid that we have
an emergency

00:21:00.746 --> 00:21:02.448
on our hands,
Mr. President.

Pendulum Summoning?

So long, Declan.
